  leave it british but listen to spain 's demand as you would for any other eu country in this deal . 
  there were several protests against the psd 's crap all over europe , amsterdam 's was n't very big but hey , it 's something, 
  well , there was a romanian protest in damsquare against that bullshit law that psd was trying to pass in romania . 
  my romanian friend , who 's very politically active invited people to join , and since i thought that this was an important stance i joined in . 
  i highly advise you to study in the netherlands , but if you 're not into very `` mainstream '' countries then you can very easily try portugal . 
  portugal boasts not only a very vibrant hub for festivals all year round , but also very good education while also keeping living costs quite small for western european standards ( just compare us to france or spain , we 're quite cheap ) . 
  there you 'll also ( depending on your university ) likely get the right to a lot of free museum and exhibit visits ( of which trust me there are a lot of to see ) . 
  as an eu citizen who speaks english , you 'll have no trouble at all with admissions likely . 
  plus , you 'll likely find ( * european * ) portuguese an easier language to learn since the phonetics of it are very similar to slavic languages , in the netherlands it 's been mistaken for czech a * lot * in my case . 
  considering my flair it probably will feel ** very ** wet once the tsunami hits or the dams break . 
  probably the earthquake itself will feel like you are standing on top of a ** huge ** nokia that just got a call , shit shaking everywhere and vibrating around the place . 
  *** we do n't speak of that god fucking damnit ***, 
  and living in the netherlands , that quite helps as well , plus also going to a protest to help out a romanian friend 's cause . 
  europe : where a lusofrench dude went to study in the netherlands and ended up in a romanian protest with a friend from bulgaria he met in russian class . 
  ** g\u00f6tterfunken is present **, 
  i 'm just a chill student in amsterdam , not really a super secret spy * ( at least that 's what you 're supposed to think ) *, 
  * i am everywhere *, 
  i was * sorta * born into it . 
  my parents are n't very religious but my grandparents ( and nearly all my other family members ) still pushed for me to attend sunday school and all that jazz and even get baptized ... fast forward a few years and i stop believing in it , i started questioning it a lot when i found out i was gay and came to my personal conclusion that it is n't truthful and thus i became an ex-catholic . 
   i 've never seen one outside of portugal though . 
  * we 're very very sneaky , hiding and observing as we borderline occupy stuff like luxembourg *, 
  that 's a question worthy of being asked in its own post to be fair , i ca n't answer it but i think it would get more attention that way , and i 'm curious to know it too now . 
  yet its value is going the same place the titanic did : * down * , and it does n't even feature multiple anything , just the same old same old . 
  we play the same exact way every one does . 
  flip the coin . 
  besides , why are you so mad about a currency you do n't even use ? 
  smells like jealousy . 
  `` homeschooling in the netherlands legal but only if you ca n't find a school fitting your philosophy or beliefs . '', 
  but next to nobody does it since it is an extremely poor choice and hard as hell to get any education at home ( france has a better system called the cned for example ) technically it is not recognized by law * but * you can get an exemption on laws relating to mandatory attendance to school on bases of religious reasons ( though good fucking luck i dare you ) . 
  i 'm so sorry ... *, 
  or i guess being technologically impaired makes it harder to adapt to new advances . 
  edit : bit rich coming from an english person to be honest , when the british pound notes all have the * exact same photo of the queen on them * and the coins can not compete with the 15 * national * designs of the euro , plus variations for special occasions . 
  glad they did , the red star always annoyed me because its lining was n't aligned with the partition between the red and the white . 
  and that coat of arms ... ugh , i do n't like stuff that is too complex to draw accurately , it takes away from the flag for me . 
  i 'm glad they adjusted their design , it would be awkward if they kept communist symbols all over . 
  dude , we 're talking about a city where i literally used actual cash * twice in a whole year * . 
  it 's not really that natural to just * require * cash for stuff you actually need ( smaller stuff like febo is perfectly fine since it even takes notes or you can order at the counter and pay with a card * and it 's not urgent * ), 
   how dare you ? 
  ** fight me **, 
  agreed . 
  i needed to use one but the automatic machine ones required coins ( ugh , what the fuck ? ), 
  so i went to a random kebab shop and asked to use their bathroom , they were like `` 50 cent '' and then when i asked if i could use a card they just shrugged and let me in for free . 
  turns out i stepped into the * one * kebab shop in all of amsterdam that does not take any cards ... 
  it amazes me how * fucking coins * are needed in this city in super tiny inconvenient places , especially toilets . 
  slovakia and slovenia have * beeaauuuutiful * flags in my opinion , especially slovenia . 
  i appreciate a very simple design with a modern simple coat of arms , and that is what their flags reflect directly , something i find that serbia , andorra , croatia , moldova , etc. . . lack is a * simple yet strong * coat of arms . 
  i also really like all the tricolors ( estonia ftw ) and the scandinavian flags ( sweden yasss ) , simplicity gets me . 
  / thread . 
  * nobody * is as fondly close to each other as you scandies . 
  * oh yes high representative , whisper the lisbon treaty in my ear and take my legislative body * i never actually interrailed , though i plan on it in a few years haha . 
  usually i just fly everywhere . 
   i 'm considering going solo-interrailing * \u041eh talk dirty to me * in portugal i highly advise profiteroles !, 
  they are my favorite dessert by far and i 'm sure you 'll love them too , plus i think they are also eaten in other countries !, 
  * inhale * ** leeroooooy jeeeeenkiiiiinnnsss **, 
   hungary and romania really ? 
  i thought you guys were borderline bffs , at least that 's how my romanian friend portrayed it ( he 's from transylvania so maybe he 's biased , i 'm not sure ), 
  eh ... just northern ireland , gibraltar and scotland , the others can stay out . 
  but first we have something else to invade ... something that i believe will bring world peace in the form of neat borders ... ** switzerland what 's good ??? 
  hush hush , this only means you can do one thing : ** dream bigger **, 
  if that is the case then go for a huawei/wiko/alcatel with a very good cam , huawei/wiko/alcatels tend to be very cheap and inexpensive and come with sd card readers so you can keep your pictures and maps all stored onboard and on the fly . 
  being huawei/wiko/alcatel , it 'll have android which is fully compatible and streamlined with google docs and facebook/messenger . 
  here 's the thing : camera quality will be * very * dependent on conditions and since no low-grade smartphone has an amazing screen , then it 'll be hard to judge * unless * you can look up examples online . 
  keep in mind that you can also get an iphone 5/5s at a cex , or even a more expensive but older phone , for your budget and have a better quality . 
  i got my nexus 6p for only 300 $ and it has full 2yr warranty as per usual . 
  the iphone 5/5s really is the guarantee that you 'll have a great camera , and i think that offline maps are very much a thing in the ios system . 
  oh man depends a ** lot ** on what you like on a smartphone . 
  do you want android , windows , ios ... do you want a nice camera , good battery , nice storage ... you 'll need to be more specific on what you 'd like * ideally * so that we can help you find the closest match to that in a 120 $ budget . 
  nah , never tip , i pay the price they told me , thank them , and leave . 
  it 's hard to tip when you live in the netherlands and 90 % of your purchases are made by debit card . 
  i think that tipping , if necessary because they have shit salaries , should be included and announced in the price and not try to get you up afterwards . 
  aka raise prices a little to pay the workers a decent salary , and if you can not , then maybe you have a shit barbershop and should consider your commercial choices . 
  yet a ) i did n't even see it and b ) i think that if you have a post * directed * at gibraltarians then you should go to r/askgibraltar and not r/askeurope just like everyone else . 
  nobody is saying you should n't post it here btw , if so it would have already been reported to the mods and removed . 
  edit : if you want to find brexiteers you can use the subreddit r/brexit, 
  ... so you decided to ask r/askeurope where most people are * not * british and the ones who * are * british tend to also be mostly in favour of the european union . 
  okay . 
  i think that culture * and economy * matter a lot for ascension into the eu . 
  obviously i would not want a substandard country to enter the union , without first meeting the criteria . 
  culture is also * very * important and this is why i do n't even want * some european countries * to join . 
  i would like that future member-states actually want to integrate and push the eu further without just wanting to keep it the same , i want the project to evolve and not be stopped by a uk v2 . 
  plus , i believe that culturally a new member state should be more liberal with lgbt rights , with minority rights , freedom of speech , rule of democracy , etc. . . 
  in this context i 'd * maybe * say australia , new zealand , and canada , mainly because they already have cultures that are liberal and fit most of my personal criteria , and their economies are in good shape and do not have a ** massive ** one nor a ** massive ** population that could endanger the say of all member states in the union . 
  the sole thing is how willing they would be to further integrate * after * ascension . 
  if the answer is `` not willing to go further '' then i would n't like them to join . 
  keep in mind that australia , canada and new zealand have tonnes of standards that diverge from the eu 's especially concerning biological elements such as bugs or wood goods being transported . 
  australia and new zealand for example need to be very careful as there are a * lot * of crop-eating pests that are not at all indigenous to the island and could have a very big effect on them , hence why it 's probably a good idea for them to not join the common market . 
  about 8 months now , i still am crap with dutch linguo and expressions ... 
   as someone who can afford appie i read this as `` someone who can afford apple '' and i was already thinking about how expensive apple stuff really is . 
  i am not proud that i had to look up what appie was but hey , whatever floats i guess . 
  hey , i 've done that when i was living in portugal , so by all means do n't hesitate !, 
  home 's where you decide it is , just make sure you 're prepared . 
  christ . 
  mary . 
  and joseph . 
  i had no idea it 's gotten bad to * that * point , holy crap , that 's pretty scary . 
  what are the actual fears over at czechia ? 
  i imagine they are n't much different than here , but what 's the whole fear/politics looking like ? 
  let me guess , all made from those kinds of people who just swallow up anything whoever their supreme f\u00fchrer is \u00e0 la erdogan-supporters ? 
  goddamnit i swear ... 
  as if i needed to like czechia even more , those are * really * damn cool .
