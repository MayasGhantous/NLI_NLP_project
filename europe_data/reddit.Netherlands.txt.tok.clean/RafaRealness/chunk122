  kudos to you , goddamn . 
   i hear you cant get work unit you have a place sorted first ? 
  guess why it might be hard to find a pace is because there just so many people living in nl * i think * you need a bank account first , and to have a bank account you 'd need a residency first . 
  it 's quite a big move i 'd say but i am not sure if you can contact employers first * before * you move . 
   thanks again my pleasure !, 
  always happy to have a fresh face here below the sea . 
  prices vary , but for me the real kick is to * find * a decent place no matter the place . 
  i do n't really find the prices that bad but the availability for me is ridiculous . 
  it is an absolute * horrible * bitch to find a residence here , but once you got that then the rest is very very straight forward . 
  you only need to open up a dutch bank account ( takes about two days to get one fully working , it 's very fast , bring your id card and your housing contract ) and also get a burgerservisenummer ( citizen service number , bsn ) which will help you out with taxes and such . 
  once you got all of that figured out , it is * very * easy to get a phone number and internet at your place , as well as setting up automatic payments ( or you can also pay your bills online for most things ) . 
  so basically the sole hard part is real estate , let me know if i can help you out with anything more specific , like how transports work here , etc. . . 
  i highly suggest you study here in amsterdam , there is * a fuck tonne * of english bachelor 's programmes in the hva , the uva ( where i study ) and the vu . 
  it is the biggest city in the netherlands and the weather is ( from what i 've heard from an irish girl in my class ) very comparable to irish weather . 
  i 'm portuguese and we do n't tip that much either to be honest . 
  we usually leave the mid-range and low-range coins behind ( anything smaller than a 20cent coin , leave it ) because they are a bit useless in practical terms ( ca n't really use them a lot ) . 
  although we have different wages , keep in mind we also have different costs of living , so we 're not really all in desperate need of tips as a wage-substitute . 
  if you do n't leave a tip we 'll probably not take much notice but even though it 's not * exactly * frowned upon , some may take it to heart . 
  * do * check for spain though , i 'm not sure how they feel about it, 
  all my food is from aldi and lidl , because i am the * one * person that ca n't afford to shop at albert heijn . 
  does that count ? 
  i 've seen a few here in amsterdam , and there was one of those pulse of europe marches too . 
  overall the eu seems to be very well-liked here . 
  my arm got way too tired because i could n't get a proper knife to chop them up ... 
   women ca n't wear pants unless riding a horse or a bicycle  women that want to dress like men need an authorization from the prefecture of police fox news : ** this is proof that france has fallen under shakira law !!!, 
  most europeans are uncut when it comes to their meat , and i honestly met two or three cut guys . 
  in my opinion is that it makes no difference when it comes to performance nor how much fun you can have with it . 
  i personally would not circumcise my kids if i had kids because i do n't find it useful , and it 's a bit of a mutilation of the penis if you think about it , but if a grown adult would like to be circumcised or there is an actual need for circumcision in a smaller child then sure . 
  ^ ( this opinion was provided to you by that one annoying gay dude ), 
  for lunch i had some rice , chicken bits , and sweet n sour sauce with some veggie slices to tie it all up nicely . 
  for a bit of a snack i had some milk cookies . 
  and now i 'm fighting the beast in the kitchen that is carrots ( who would have thought that they are amazingly fucking hard to cut jesus what the fuck ) to make myself some oliver salad . 
  i am pretty sure that is not a common occurrence in the * least * , i mean , i 've never heard about a case like that at all . 
  it is already very odd he knew it was from poland to begin with , unless of course it was * not * the same unit with the same exact procedures and adjacent licenses , same between us states . 
  i , for one , never heard about a case like that , appart from this one racist in my grandma 's village who refuses to buy `` foreign products '' but she just buys whatever does n't have any spanish written on it basically . 
  ah yes , well , poland has lower prices and a lower cost of living , so the same appliance can be cheaper in poland for that reason alone , it 's a common occurrence even within countries . 
  where i live ( amsterdam ) , nearly everything is more expensive than , for example , groningen . 
  this is something that pretty much happens everywhere with a capitalist free-market economy . 
  well , i am mainly asking you about your question , and you said :  i mean there seem to be complexities of doing business which do not exist in other single markets . 
  so i 'd expect you 'd know an example or two at least . 
  do n't take it the wrong way , i think it 's great that you are interested in such topics , but i 'm not sure what you 'd like to know about the single market more specifically . 
  like ? 
  every market has its own particular characteristics , you can argue the exact same for the us market , or the russian market , or the chinese market ... 
  no idea what you mean to be honest . 
  i go across the border a ** lot ** and whenever i buy something anywhere here it 's the same as if i had bought it somewhere else ; sure currency and price may vary but yeah ... 
  i do n't pay taxes nor have to declare anything , and our products respect the same standard regulations . 
  i 'm not really sure if this answers your question , because i 'm not sure what * exactly * your question is . 
  hope you enjoy it over here !, 
  if you 're looking for computer parts go to the mediamarkt that is * just * outside the bijlmer arena , that 's open for more hours than most and has a pretty good choice in pretty much everything ( including chromebooks , i highly recommend the acer r13 , it 's awesome ) . 
  i go outside and just walk , find something to do . 
  sometimes some soft-serve iced cream to just enjoy myself with , or head to an open air park and relax with a friend or two . 
  sometimes i just go window-shopping or go see a new museum or something . 
  basically just be outside in general . 
  i wish we had lots of what you guys have , like marco marco , or reese 's cups , those crazy varieties of oreos and kitkats and stuff , etc. . . 
  i * used * to really want american smartphones that were not made available in europe , or at least do not get the same service in europe ( for example , android updates come to europe later on , and some apps and services are not available here ) . 
  american netflix is also something i really wan na try out , but i wo n't hold my breath since i think the dutch one is already pretty good, 
  in the netherlands they are pretty common if you want them , and at us price too . 
  i think most of them sorta suck but mine is pretty awesome . 
  come over on holidays and get yourself one !, 
  in france , look at lepen ( no not marine , her dad ) versus chirac in 2002 . 
  chirac ** mopped the floor after he murdered that election with blood everywhere in the second round ** with the fn basically . 
  he won with 82,2 % of the vote in the second round and jesus christ that was a harsh clapback to the fn considering the bullshit they were spewing that year . 
  the fn lost major popularity over the demonisation it received because of jean-marie lepen who , to this day , calls the holocaust `` a small detail '' and is full of racist and xenophobic remarks every other month ... 
  it is so bad that marine lepen spent * years * doing damage control after the fn literally kicked him out for being a bit too `` outspoken '' about some topics . 
  for me it does not get far worse than that ... 
  there also was the ** chute ** of the pvda in the dutch elections , but i do n't know enough about it to fully comment on it . 
  who is she ? 
  what season was she on ? 
  this is a question for r/unitedkingdom i think ... 
  for me the brandenburg gate definitely takes the cake . 
  it stands as a symbol of unity and i always get choked up thinking about its historic division in berlin . 
  it is definitely strong for me since i love the history of communism so much , and it stands tall as such a beautiful moment at the end of the division of our continent , it 's intense to me . 
  [ brandenburg gate today ] ( https://images3.alphacoders.com/681/681429.jpg ) [ brandenburg gate after the berlin wall was finished ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/29/98/61/299861f98418bd266fb0afbc1a9214f7.jpg ), 
  mainly there is a convergence of basic values like the equality of people regardless of multiple factors such as sex ( some parts such as religion are a bit contested ) , as well as the defense of liberal democratic systems , defense of fundamental human rights such as freedom of speech , solid welfare systems to protect the weakest , etc. . . 
  these are often very common among europeans , and a lot of pan-european projects work to defend these core values . 
  there are theories used to explain european integration , and i think that there is one in particular that is very relevant to this case : liberal intergovernmentalism . 
  this theory believes that , by form of consensus in one particular field ( let 's say , borderless trade for the sale of shoes ) then states will merge that particular field into one and `` integrate '' it and rule it together , because they all agree . 
  this can be applied to what you just said about the european values , and by consequence it is . 
  the eu greatly defended stability in liberal democratic regimes and continues to do so to this day , which is primarily a european value to defend democratic rule . 
  portuguese one : i am * very * skeptical of it , but overall tolerate it ( even if i disagree with it at times ) . 
  french one : bureaucratic mess , does n't function as well as it should , needs work done , seriously . 
  dutch one : i really like our government , even if i disagree here and there i feel like it 's a very good government to have , especially compared to others in the world . 
  this is the sort of stuff putin would put in the coffee of his enemies . 
  * underrated posts like these are my favourite *, 
  aaah , yeah that 's understandable . 
  i love the monarchy but i think it should still be 100 % symbolic , even i 'd be pissed if he started acting up . 
  luckily it 's willem , not really gon na happen likely . 
  i * live * in the netherlands , but i 'm luso-french !,

  since you kindly went back and edited your comment , i 'll reply to the changes as well . 
   oh , and canadian banks got their own bailouts during the recession , and corporations like bombadier stay getting bailouts . 
  yes , and it * still * is not as much as american bailouts , nor how many safeties corporations get in america . 
  bailouts happen to all of the world , even in europe we sometimes bailed out certain industries , but america keeps doing so without obligations for the companies ( they bailed airlines to secure jobs , and yet people were laid off regardless afterwards , the money went to the ceos pockets * again * ) and also bending anyone 's interests into those of the lobbyists , especially now under the trump administration that allowed * coal dust * to be deposited into * rivers * . 
   i also suggest you look up what zombie corporations & banks are in japan , and what their economic policy has been since about 1990 . 
  hell , and to be real , i actually think corporations in japan have way more political influence than america . 
  that might surprise you given your sterotypes , but the corporate culture of japan kinda makes it a inevitability . 
  we 're all aware of that , but japan is not the us . 
  japan is n't as big and it keeps to itself * far * more than the us when it comes to economic factors . 
  the us is a * far * bigger economy which would have far more of a say in the market , plus the ttip even asked for our governments to pay * american corporations * should we pass legislation they did n't like ... which we obviously are n't going to take kindly to . 
  plus , the fta is still being discussed and it is n't a huge one like the ttip , so far it seems to be on a smaller scale with less included sectors .
