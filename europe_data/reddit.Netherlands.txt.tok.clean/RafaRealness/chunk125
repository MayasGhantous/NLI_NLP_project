  plus it 's based on * a nationality * and not a race , it 's not targeting * ethnic * turks , it 's targeting turk citizens/people who live in turkey, 
  op tried to join a facebook group for an e-cig company from europe that sells their products in turkey . 
  contacted mod to see why , and basically had a slightly more heated conversation as to why turkish people in particular are not being accepted . 
  she 's being a fucking cunt against turkish citizens that is 100 % clear , this is clear discrimination against a customer based on their citizenship . 
  it is n't racism since this discrimination is not based on race , it really is just based on nationality . 
  i asked you about the articles , where do you find them ? 
  because when i look it up ( literally takes 30 seconds per site ) i can not find any articles . 
  this for me is more proof that you have an image of the west that you fabricated yourself and when asked to provide proof , you retract . 
  tell me the sources that keep on spewing these articles , it 's that simple . 
  dude , again , i went up to the main dutch news websites , looked it up , no articles found . 
  so again , tell me the sources you get this from . 
  same can be said for de volkskrant , nos.nl , etc. . . 
  i so far saw * one * british article about gypsies , and that 's the one on r/europe so i have no idea where you keep hearing this . 
   we do n't say anything about the netherlands in our media . 
  ethnic relations and abuse in the west is not a thing you can read about in bulgarian media . 
  yeah , because the netherlands does n't matter to you that much , yet other eastern european states have media talking shit about , for example , germany . 
  has bulgarian media never criticized germany , or italy , or spain , or portugal , or france , etc. . . ? 
   its not just the media , obviously there are many people who believe in the same shit and you can see it even from comments on reddit . 
  yeah , and look at that * one * thread in r/europe about gypsies where nearly everyone agrees that they must integrate , and the ones who do n't are massively downvoted . 
  lepen 's dad called the holocaust `` a small detail '' so does this mean that * all * french people are like that ? 
  so let 's start bashing bulgarians for the shit your medias say about us as well . 
  do you believe that we are defined by our media ? 
  because if so the uk is anything between the daily mail and the bbc ... media is * not * opinion , and you can very easily cherrypick those articles from sources that often are just biased tabloids , not to mention how absolutely * rare * the articles really are ... what * does * genuinely float in western opinion about oppression in eastern europe is usually the shitshow that poland is facing with regards to abortion , or the romanian protests against * literally making abuse of power impunible under law * . 
  bottomline is : we are * not * our media , just like * you * are not your media . 
  again , who the hell are the moralistic westerners , considering that gyspies get the same treatment as anyone else ? 
  nobody gives a rat 's ass about them in the west , and usually public opinion about gypsies is pretty damn bad because of the fact that statistically they are a minority that commits more crime than others , same goes for , for example , moroccans and algerians . 
  you 're the ones who have them in your countries so they are your responsibility , if you fail to integrate them into bulgarian , romanian , hungarian , etc. . . society , then it 's your job to address the issue . 
  so now it 's * not * the west , it 's just the `` moralistic ones '' ? 
  plus , the netherlands * does n't * have a big roma population , roughly the same amount as portugal , and just like in portugal , they are * not * an exception to law nor get any special treatment . 
  gypsies here either integrate into dutch society or will keep getting discriminated , just like any other unintegrated minority . 
  we could argue that a gypsy state should be in eastern europe because that 's where most of them are . 
  why should the western states deal with a population primarily from romania , bulgaria , and hungary ? 
  your problem , not ours . 
  this alone deserves this comment to be guilded . 
  considering how gypsies are treated in the west , the judgment is not really `` from afar '' , just look at portugal or france . 
  they come to the west because we got more money than the east , but to say that we 're tolerant to anything from to them is pretty far from the truth . 
  we apply the laws to them and the ones who choose to integrate are n't a nuisance , the ones who decide to break the law can fuck right off and are trialed and sentenced accordingly . 
  not really rocket science . 
  portugal : [ 404 ] france : super fancy paris accent that somehow sounds hot to them ? 
  netherlands : that * one * guy from austin powers, 
  [ everywhere i go , basically everyone does this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l397twlwruu ) as for the agencies , well , `` piracy is literally rape/genocide '' etc. . . 
  agencies all over the place to be honest , super easy to avoid since we still have privacy rights concerning what we download generally . 
  you 'd be surprised to be honest , ask a frenchman what he thinks about gypsies , or a spaniard . 
  countries should not be predominantly inhabited by the descendants of the ethnic group that founded it because that is pretty impossible , nobody is 100 % this or that in europe . 
  what genuinely is important is individual behavior . 
  what i mean by this is if you live in denmark , for me you must speak danish and fully embrace danish culture . 
  it is not at all about what ethnicity you happen to be , it is what culture you identify with , and in the netherlands you have a very good example : lots of surinamese people here fully embrace dutch culture and lifestyle , they thus are a full part of dutch society and nearly all of them are dutch by citizenship as well . 
  i pay for both , it 's included in my rent , however this is not very common since i live in a student residency . 
  in private residencies you need your own contract and it can range from 47,50 $ to 85 $ , however for the first 6 months you only pay 35 $ or 50 $ with kpn for example . 
  i grew near the beach in carcavelos , so that one by far . 
  yeah it 's what i count on doing , but firstly i got ta learn how to bike ( yes i know i moved to the fucking netherlands without knowing how to bike it 's absolute heresy please do n't get wilders to deport me ), 
  i have n't seen the hague 's chinatown actually , however if i do i 'll hit you up !, 
  my guess is that it 's either similar or even bigger , because the amsterdammer one is very small so i doubt there is something smaller than it . 
  i am from portugal , and i am short * as fuuuuck * compared to dutch people . 
  i can relate , i need to buy a small bike as well so ... ya know , ya got ta do what ya got ta do and block them haters out with pindakaas . 
  [ then it 's called southern , not south ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_africa ) [ ( extra distinction explanation between the two ) ] ( http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/29274/south-vs-southern-difference ), 
   namibia , which is in south africa . 
  namibia and south africa are two different countries though . 
  portugal : yup , there are tonnes of them , they are very nice and usually sell absolutely awesome fish and artisan products for very cheap prices , it 's a great fun activity to just thrift around one . 
  france : there still are tonnes of them but they are far less charming , mainly focusing on fresh foods like fruit veggies and fish , as well as cheap knockoff clothes and other really low-grade chinese products . 
  not much to see , i just really went there for the cheap fish to be honest . 
  the netherlands : again , tonnes of them but these depend on which flea market you go to . 
  some of them are far more focused on food ( like dutch cheese and poffertjes ) others are more focused on flowers and clothing ( usually very cheap knockoff ones , but honestly it is not bad at all ) . 
  when it comes to weapons , i have yet to see an actual weapon that was not a decoration for sale . 
  the weapon culture in europe is extremely tiny compared to the american one , so we do n't really buy much of that . 
  pocket knives can maybe be purchased but honestly i have yet to see one , and as for other weapons , we tend to have very strict regulation concerning gun safety so it will be a miracle ( and possibly very illegal ) to find a live-fire gun in a flea market . 
  daily , there 's lots of both dutch citizens that are asian , and immigrants from the former dutch colonies as well . 
  just like surinamese people , they integrate * very * well so nobody really bats an eye at them , unless you go to this * one * street in amsterdam where everything is in mandarin chinese for some reason ( a teeny tiny chinatown basically ) . 
  ** a bike . 
  ** start adding the tax on your prices in supermarkets ** , seriously what the actual fuck is up with that . 
  also , recycle more and use more green energy ( never enough ! ) . 
  aside from that , on broader aspects , i think that maybe the us should let go of certain titles like `` leader of the free world '' that do n't really mean anything anymore , as well as get better medias . 
  right now what i see of us television is epic series , `` news '' with horribly untrue misconceptions about * everything * ( microwaves turning into cameras is a personal favorite ) , and comedies with great social commentary that often go underappreciated . 
  i also think that education and healthcare are * horridly * ignored issues , and everyone deserves an easy access to both education and healthcare no matter what their background is , especially in a powerful and developed country like the us . 
  the last thing that i think that every european will repeat here is stop saying `` oh i 'm irish , my grandfather was from dublin ! '', 
  because that is not * at all * the same for us , you are american . 
  ** based on what i know ** i think that spain or the uk would probably be the least stable countries . 
  firstly let me make clear that i think that all countries in western europe are actually pretty damn stable . 
  now , i think that the uk , due to its stance on brexit and still unclear terms for northern ireland , gibraltar , and scotland , may possibly have issues surviving * in its state right now * ( maintaining its unity and political processes as is excluding eu-related elements ) . 
  i doubt heavily that the uk will really go through the process unchanged . 
  spain is a different can of worms , the social questions that they face over different parts of spain is still very much present ( catalonia being the primary case ) and this `` status quo '' seems to be more like a pressure cooker rather than a calm and cooperative dialogue between all parties , they mainly seem too divergent on the future and too divided to fully cooperate . 
  as for terrorism , it really is a hard case because based on what i 've read ( and correct me if i 'm wrong ) the isis issue is slowly but steadily getting rectified and * maybe * in a few years syria will go back to being its normal self . 
  i believe that the current trend of terrorism that we are seeing is more of a trend , and statistically these tend to come in waves based on ongoing conflict , for example in the netherlands we 've had quite a few terrorist attacks in the 70 's mainly related to an independentist movement in indonesia ( as well as one incident in 1974 perpetrated by the japanese red army , and the assassination of richard sykes by the provisional irish republican army ) . 
  so in the netherlands , the 70 's really were * those * days of terrorism due to other world issues . 
  france , for me , is an unfortunate victim of terrorism more often due to its fame , because terrorists will always want to have the highest impact so attacking france ( as it is a highly celebrated country ) is the way to achieve this ; furthermore france also was involved in several conflicts such as colonisation of algeria and syria that even after independence links them with these conflicts . 
  i seriously doubt that any western european will have a heavy amount of rioting , but then again it 's hard to quantify due to the fact that in france , the stereotype is very true . 
  i lived in france for 5 years and it was basically as if every other week there was a new riot , but it has proven to be more like the status quo rather than an actual factor of instability . 
  ** however ** with the continuous \u00e9tat d'urgence that is constantly being extended to no end ( whose need is an entirely different debate ) definitely is changing this due to the prohibition of assembly ( for security reasons ) and i can not really say what long-term effect this will have or if the \u00e9tat d'urgence will be extended . 
  so basically , i see a political dissonance that is growing and becoming less stable in the uk and spain , due to diverging communities ' visions of the future within the countries , however it 's important to note that even * if * these eventually develop into something that effectively disrupts the current existence , it wo n't likely degenerate severely . 
  we had a lecture all about this a few weeks ago !, 
  what masters are you doing ? 
  i am not entirely sure , i have quite a hard time navigating the new requirements for stufi and such , i am even still trying to see if i am elegible for * anything * . 
  for * dutch * students , if you are not dutch you do not get 99 % of it , even if you 're an eu citizen . 
  well , just cite some according to you , because all i can find are * painfully * biased results right now . 
  the sort of source that probably would claim he 's a muslim from kenya who hates america and eats white babies . 
  yup , or some pieces of bread with some dipping sauces from ah . 
  or just those liquid yoghurts everyone has now . 
   worst : obama why is obama * the * worst us president ? 
  i mean , is he seriously worse than * bush * and * clinton * ? 
  in the netherlands , tuition fee is 2 000 $ per year usually .
