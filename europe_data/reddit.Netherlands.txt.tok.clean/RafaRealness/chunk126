  this may seem like a lot considering that a lot of other countries in europe have no tuition fees . 
  however , you can also just pay 200 $ monthly ( with a part-time job , it is * very very easy * to do so and part-time jobs are abundant even to other eu students ) or you can get a very cheap student loan with very little interest rate . 
  there are also a lot of people whose tuition is paid by their parents . 
  i live in a very large community of surinamese/caribbean immigrants ( and their descendants ) in nl and yup , ditto . 
  they literally are just like the dutch , sole possible difference i sometimes notice is a tiny accent ( but hell who am i to judge i have one too ) . 
  they also cook different food somtimes , very tasty . 
  thanks man !, 
  really ? 
  whenever i ask for water at febo or subway tghey always hand me sparkling water . 
  maybe it 's just in zuidoost or something . 
  not in amsterdam , where * everything * is sparkling ( even fucking iced tea what the fuck ) . 
  i just turned 20 today !, 
  i do n't own a car because where i live it 's mainly bikes and public transport ( plus i do n't know how to drive yet nor do i have the money for a car nor even the need for one ) . . 
  i live alone abroad though , i think that is slightly less common for uni students ( since most tend to study locally ) but yeah . 
  the british monarchy is a moneymaking machine economically , the tourism revenue it generates greatly surpasses their expenses . 
  plus , the brits seem very happy with her majesty , so i * seriously * doubt brexit will affect the monarchy at all . 
  pretty much this . 
  i 'd also add maybe having a better representative system ( though i 'd have to wait and see how it all would look like with those changes first , maybe even unneeded ) and less power to the federal government in social questions but more to the states themselves . 
   if i were to travel to the eu , should i expect any sort of prejudices due to being american ? 
  nah , not really , there 's lots of americans here and the golden rule is : be kind to us and we 'll like you . 
   due to being black ? 
  not in western europe unless you go to a more isolated farm-like community ( there you may meet some racist assholes , we do n't like them either )  i do n't speak a 2nd language , will that be a problem ? 
  pretty much expected of tourists really , so it 's not at all a problem in most of western europe ( except france but ... it 's france do n't take it personally and they will * try * to speak english ) . 
  * if * i can actually vote next elections after naturalisation , i will likely go for d66 or groenlinks ( leaning more towards groenlinks unless d66 impresses me this round ) , mainly because i agree with their views on social issues as well as their proposed plans . 
  i considered voting for the sp but they are too radical for my taste , and pvda is a bit annoying to me because even though i agree with * some * things they would like to do , they like to cry about the eu and that is something we seriously do n't need . 
  i think it might be really an american thing , because they never were broken in any country i 've ever been in and asked for an iced cream . 
  there are multiple things to see over here !, 
  if you like tulips maybe take a look at our blomenmarkt , and once you 're done with that you can take the tram to go visit the heineken experience . 
  you can also head to damsquare and do some shopping therapy in kalverstraat . 
  we also have a small but cute science museum called nemo , and a tonne of other museums including the portuguese synagogue . 
  obviously you will see lots of canals all over the place , that 's a bit inevitable , and usually if you 're here mainly for tourism , you might want to stick to the centrum region ( where everything really touristy is ) and its adjacent parts . 
  if you would like to see tulips in their full damn glory , you can head to amsterdam centraal and take the train to lisse and check out the keukenhof , though keep in mind that it 's mainly open from march to may . 
  possibly denmark , on a lot of social issues we tend to agree a lot , and i believe that * if we absolutely have to choose * then i 'd go with former vikings and try to get them to annex zuid brabant back ^ / s no but yeah , denmark most likely would be who i prefer to rule the netherlands . 
  0/10 because every bloody person in the world learns brazilian portuguese , 10/10 for the * one * guy on earth wanting to learn european portuguese . 
  same as u/atlas _ at basically . 
  * help ... me ... *, 
  between `` good countries '' and `` bad countries '' the us is without a doubt in the `` good countries '' section . 
  * personally * i have a lot less desirability to move to the us because of my perception of it . 
  it seems too `` messy '' in terms of what i can get as a worker ( the government is too shaky for me , it looks like a telenovela from the outside ) . 
  furthermore the us is very diverse when it comes to social questions such as gay acceptability , religion , cultural diversity , etc. . . especially between different states , which are questions i deeply care about but the dialog between different sides seems to be who can shout the loudest every time ( something i * seriously * ca n't with ) . 
  i 'd rank the us alongside poland , vietnam , brazil , south africa ... basically i do n't really want to move there at all for multiple reasons and will always actively defend it , but if i were forced i would n't die from it . 
  the us is n't the worst country at all , but it 's merely not the one for me by a long shot . 
  * this is super subjective , keep that in mind , i am sure that a lot of people in europe have different opinions *, 
  australia , canada , or new zealand . 
  mainly because they speak english , i like their state of affairs and their cultures , and i think i 'd feel most at home there outside of europe . 
  are you serious ? 
  i actually stayed with a host family super close to the sunshine coast !, 
  politically australia is more like the uk in my opinion , but products-wise ( yes i judge that ) it feels a tad more american ( when i was there in noosa , the stores had that ... weird american feel to them ) . 
  culturally i think australia really is its own thing . 
  you 're similar to europe in the fact that you participate in eurovision . 
  ^ ( please continue ), 
  my polish friend ( from warsaw ) told me about it and how he did it in his school in poland , maybe he was an exception ? 
  i was told that european portuguese sounds like russian/ukrainian/czech , so yeah , it might be because of that . 
  my best guess is that it 's for jobs with irregular working patterns ( like , you work a total of 3 days a week , which is a total of 9 days per month , so to calculate it we 'd use days ) there are lots of jobs , especially available to students , that have irregular working patterns, 
  you 've got a marvellous accent up north i must say , it 's just so endearing . 
  i have no good goddamn clue what the fuck 's up with the us to be honest . 
  the hate speech laws for me are confusing , because it seems like you can already pretty much get away with saying anything to begin with ... but then there is also huge commotions about hate speech * sometimes * so i have no damn idea where the line is ... for me there 's a bit of a very generalized rule : if you are going to say something offensive , either do it * in the strict purpose of comedy and be clear about it * or * be objective with your criticism and relevant facts * . 
  i usually go for euronews every now and then but keep in mind that it 's known to be biased at times , plus i sometimes find that the news are too lacking in depth . 
  when you speak , do you pronounce words the american way , or the british way ? 
  ( any of the british accents , they have far too many for me to count ) . 
  i believe that the usa as a modern and strong democratic state needs some reforms now . 
  the bi-party system is for me counter productive and americans genuinely deserve better from their government . 
  otherwise we get shit like fucking * trump * . 
  never said it was , i find it pretty damn undemocratic as well myself . 
  i believe that due to the fact that it effectively circumvents the public vote , i do n't think it would be considered democratic enough . 
  i personally find the american system * very * undemocratic , but it 's a debatable issue i must admit . 
  never , i just take them off when i get home , then put on some slippers or walk around with my socks on . 
  * oh god * ok so , the netherlands * has * minimum wage but it depends a lot on the amount of time you 're working ( divided by day , week , or month ) and your age ( 15-23y / o get paid less , each year between those ages has basically its own set of minimum wages . 
  as of the 1st of january 2017 , our minimum wage table looks like [ this ] ( https://www.government.nl/topics/minimum-wage/contents/amount-of-the-minimum-wage ) . 
  it ranges from 21.48 $ ( for a 15y/o working for one day ) to 1551.60 $ ( for a 23y/o or older for a month ) . 
  so it 's a bit weird and hard to get used to it , but yeah , we basically have 27 different minimum wages ... 
  my bulgarian friend gave me one and explained to me that i need to have it on until i find a sign of spring and then cut it off and put it on the sign of spring , the sign of spring can be stuff like a blooming flower and stuff . 
  i had no idea this was a thing , apparently it 's a thing in the balkans ( and i think maybe poland ? ), 
  but bulgaria gives bracelets to anyone , but romania gives it to * women * only . 
  that 's basically all the knowledge i have on it ... 
  man , poor you guys , i 'd be real damn done with them too ... 
  is the mccann case still a thing over there ? 
  the package says tortillas , so that 's what i call them . 
  as for tortilla chips , for me it 's nachos . 
  i cheered for both france and portugal at the euro . 
  ** i know no limits ** to be fair i 'm not big on sports , so i 'm just happy to see countries play together i guess . 
  but when it comes to eurovision ** fuck you sweden **, 
  both . 
  * i am versatile . 
  my pleasure !, 
  keep in mind that ( as with everything in reddit ) this is a bit subjective , and other people 's opinions may vary in the matter . 
  was it ? 
  or maybe ... * are you looking for a sexy sexy soviet communist job in rossiya ? 
   berlusconi has been the owner of ac milan wait seriously ? 
  you just reminded me of that song `` ponho o carro , tiro o carro \u00e0 hora que eu quiser ... '' * and we can explain that *, 
  ** oh , do you mean football ? 
  your username might be a * little bit * relevant, 
  i believe that there should be a bit more serious talks over eu membership and the efta alternative . 
  it 's gon na be hard to sell the euro and schengen to scotland , unless we make opt-outs . 
  for me in the scottish case , they could join the efta first to secure full access to the common market , but afterwards consider full eu membership if they so wish and if the eu is willing to engage with opt-outs on the euro and schengen ( which i am 99 % sure they are , especially schengen which is bloody useless to scotland ) . 
  we got put on blast for madeline mccann 's disappearance and british authorities on the matter not only were shady as fuck whenever we found evidence against her parents , but also pretty disruptive to our authorities ( even ignoring that the parents were very much suspects ) . 
  ever since , although the uk and portugal has quieted down with the poor girl 's case , the uk has n't really been defending portuguese interest at all . 
  for example , the eu wanted to impose sanctions both in spain and portugal for not completing their economic goals to recovery , even though portugal only missed the mark by 1 % and it was demonstrated that it was to bail one of our banks in order to * prevent * even worse consequences , whereas spain showed nearly no progress ... who stood up for portugal then ? 
  not the uk , but france . 
  the uk may have been our great ally for centuries and we still honor that to this day , but it 's aberrant and clear to us that the uk * does not * give a fuck about us .
