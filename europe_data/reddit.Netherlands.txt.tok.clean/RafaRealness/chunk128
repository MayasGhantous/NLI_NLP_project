  and can they strike their own deals with other nations ? 
  or control their own borders ? 
  look at norway : not in the eu ( joined the efta instead ) and still has control over what you just said . 
  scotland can do the same . 
  in order for legislation to pass , the council of ministers ( * literally your own ministers * ) must agree to it . 
  should they not agree then a compromise must be reached where everyone agrees and is satisfied to accept it . 
  nothing goes ahead without a greenlight all around . 
  ( keep in mind , opt-outs are also possible , like they were for ireland , the uk , and denmark concerning the euro ) . 
  scotland would have basically * as much say * as the uk , just like every other country . 
  the european parliament is * not * designed to represent countries ( hence why it 's a different entity altogether ) and has no power of initiative even , it is meant merely to represent the european citizens themselves regardless of government . 
  yet they can also just * not * join the eu at all . 
  can a uk scotland do any of what you just said ? 
  fact is : sovereign countries , even within the eu , have * far * more power over themselves than scotland currently has under westminster . 
  feel free to not like it and whatever , but this is scotland 's say to either be independent or not . 
  they voted to stay in the eu and yet they are essentially being dragged out with little to no say in the matter , is n't that a bitch . 
   scotland want independence from the shackles of westminster , only to be tied down by the shackles of brussels . 
  i do n't get it . 
  in the eu , they can veto decisions , they can also leave the eu liek you did , they are ultimately in charge of theirselves . 
  in the uk they must bend their will for whatever westminster commands . 
  brussels is n't at all that powerful to begin with , staff-wise there 's more people working for the municipality of amsterdam than there are people working for the eu ( literally , that is an actual thing ... ) . 
  i support it ** as long as ** scotland meets the criteria to join the eu . 
  i support scotland to decide for itself no matter if they want to be a part of the uk or independent , but for joining the eu i believe they must meet criteria ( this should not be at all an issue and they should be fast-tracked on most elements , but their deficit vis a vis the british economy sometimes worries me ) . 
  czech is next on my list actually ... fuck . 
  at least it 's not polish ... 
  never heard about it but * what in the absolute fuck * i hope it stops soon fucking hell . 
  ** join the blue side norway . 
  embrace the g\u00d6tterfunken ** / s, 
  i 'm traumatised . 
   papa le pen stealing the everliving fuck out of this . 
  join the eu , baby , i know you want it . 
  * one of us , one of us , one of us , * one of us , one of us , one of us , ** one of us , one of us , one of us , one of us , one of us , one of us **, 
   if anything gay clubs are more prevalent where lgbt people ca n't be as open in the rest of society . 
  this is highly ignored but very true . 
  in amsterdam there are still gay clubs and such but they are * much * smaller because being gay here is pretty normal and just not really a big deal . 
  there are gay * parties * that take place in non-gay specific places , but they are usually full of bloody tourists ( as everything ) . 
  russia has a pretty big gay porn industry apparently , sexy sexy soviet communist butt stuff i bet . 
  democrat . 
  they are both fucking crazy but democrats are * less * crazy than republicans . 
  it 's really choosing the lesser of two evils for me i think , neither side seems good . 
  true . 
  i must say that it 's really damn delicious . 
  in france , in your last two years of high school education ( if you chose to do regular standard education and not a baccalaur\u00e9at pro or something lower ) you need to choose between 3 series : es = socio economics , pretty self explanatory s = sciences , ditto . 
  l = literary , pretty much focused on french literature and philosophy, 
  oh yeah , i forgot about the `` em '', 
  really ? 
  i never came across one , i do see lots of surinamese stalls and such though . 
  russian has 6 gramatical cases . 
  two of them are particular : the accusative and the genitive . 
  the accusative is usually to indicate that whatever is in accusative is the direct object , or used with \u0432 or \u043d\u0430 to indicate direction . 
  the genetive has more functions , it 's used with 23 prepositions ( \u0434\u043e , \u0438\u0437 , \u0434\u043b\u044f ... ) , it is used to indicate quantities ( or lack of something ) , in combination with * some * verbs ( like \u0436\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c , to wait ) , and to indicate possessions . 
  so far so good right ? 
  well not quite , the pronouns also change with the case system , only in the genitive and the accusative they are the * exact same * except that `` what '' changes from \u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e in the genitive to \u0447\u0442\u043e in the accusative ( which is the same as the nominative case ) . 
  still not confusing enough ? 
  well , if a noun designates a human being or an animal , it is called * animate * ( this is actually an extreme generalisation , some mushrooms count as animate for example , and some characters that are personified count as animate even if what they are , like trees and such , are not animate ) . the endings of masculine nouns in the genitive and the accusative case are the same , which means that * masculine * nouns are marked for being animate or not ... * still * unimpressed ? 
  masculine first names , father 's names , and last names which end in a * consonant * , take the same ending as masculine nouns ( ending in a consonant ) with the exception of the * instrumental * case . 
  ** i have been studying russian for just 6 weeks and this is exactly the stuff we all need to know flawlessly otherwise russian makes no fucking sense . 
  help **, 
  very true , homophones !, 
  ( no , they are not gay phones ) . 
  * g\u00f6tterfunken intensifies *, 
  well , it 's very interesting indeed , because i think i only ever heard it in english , greek ( i think , i may be wrong ) , and icelandic . 
  i 've recently became really interested in vowel reduction in languages , especially because i found a lot of similarities between the unstressed reduction in portuguese and the one in russian ( with some small differences ) . 
  the english `` th '' and the `` ph '' do n't actually exist in portuguese , instead they are replaced by `` t '' and `` f '' ( filosofia for example ) . 
  the sound itself , well , i ca n't think of any instance where we actually use that sound at all . 
  i think that to the untrained ear you may hear it but we distinguish it as two separate sounds . 
  if you find an example of portuguese speech using the `` th '' sound i could maybe see what sound it actually is . 
  keep in mind i speak * european * portuguese , and * brazilian * portuguese has a few pronunciation differences , their `` de '' is more of a `` dj\u00e9h '' for us and for them ours sounds like `` duh '' . 
  in portuguese , the usage of definite articles is a * bitch * to learn if you 're a foreigner . 
  we use it all the time like , to say `` maria eats codfish '' we say '' ** a ** maria come bacalhau '' and then our prepositions get glued to the articles : it 's not france , it 's ** a ** fran\u00e7a and it 's not in the france , it 's ** em ** fran\u00e7a ... but this is an exception !, 
  because school is '' ** a ** escola '' but in school is '' ** na ** escola '' . 
  luckily these have some logic but i admit that it may surprise some foreigners . 
  there 's loads of different stuff and i honestly love explaining languages , like how we have very weird rules concerning tonic syllables and the usage of the letter `` h '' in spelling ( it can be silent or have 3 different sounds depending on what letter comes before it ) . 
  i only ever heard of it in vietnamese restaurants , but it 's not at all that popular . 
  you can find it if you actively look for it basically . 
  i 'll pretty much force you to go outside to be honest , i got stuff to do and things to see . 
  i did * not * study hard to just get to study here and not get to see all of nl, 
  i live in a student housing complex where everyone has their own housing . 
  we have our exclusive laundry room with washing machines and dryers . 
  so far i have n't had any issues at all , however i 've heard that there are certain problems that arise , especially with either isolated or poorly educated communities . 
  there is a gay acquaintance of mine that even got beaten up at the * centre of amsterdam * one evening ... by homophobic tourists that apparently did not get the memo ... dutch people have an opinion about * everything * in my opinion ( see what i did there ? ), 
  and i do n't think that 's peculiarly exclusive to gay people , they will also judge you if you like a certain type of women as a straight man . 
  i think that the netherlands has some steps to take , definitely , every place in the world does , but i still feel like i am very safe here . 
  in the netherlands , probably , yes ( if i were n't horribly single , haha ) . 
  i feel very safe and normal here and do n't really feel judged nor treated differently for it in france , no , not really . 
  although it may not directly direct to issues , it 's still socially judged and you definitely can feel stared at , plus some neighborhoods are rougher than others ... france is n't really very homophobic but there is this time that france needs to get used to the change that is gay acceptance , it seems like the idea of same-sex couples is still fresh so it needs time to settle in first . 
  very good , in the netherlands i am treated fully normally , and nobody gives two fucks/doesn ' t even know . 
  life 's sweet here i guess , but keep in mind that we * do * have that weird bible belt where this may not be the case . 
  in france my sexual orientation came more as a shock and i definitely had some nasty encounters and problems in a social level because of it , but overall i lived a happy life and did n't really feel attacked or anything ; but there * are * still a lot of anti-lgbt sentiments here and there . 
   denk and forum for democracy won seats , they are very bad politicians . 
  that 's already calling them bloody politicians , they are for me just tumblr-quality shouting at everything and saying `` racist '', 
  i love the eu 's flag to be honest . 
  i have no idea about american colleges , and colleges tend to depend a * lot * between countries ( france and the netherlands for example have very different systems ) . 
  you best ask the brits for oxford or cambridge . 
  i do n't think they are * vital * but they are by far , most definitely , very welcome in my books . 
  i like the fact that there is a genuine call to show public support for the eu , the sole criticism i have to it is that it seems very focused on germany right now , and i believe it needs to grow on a more pan-european level first . 
  one of the benefits this can have for the eu ( which i personally support hence why i think of it as a good thing , it 's subjective really ) is to create a more european dialogue and promote european symbols , thus having an impact on public opinion and , maybe in the long run , the `` brand '' that the eu has . 
  i 'm not a citizen * yet * !, 
  i am fairly confident that the dutch voted correctly and that the pvv can fuck off ( as is tradition ) . 
  mark rutte seems to be doing very well in the predictions , and around me , the great big debate is vvd vs d66 vs gl , which for me are all good parties . 
  no need to worry about the netherlands , worry a bit about france though , they need it !,
