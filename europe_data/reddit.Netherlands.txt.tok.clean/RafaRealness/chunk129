  ca n't vote , only people with dutch citizenship can vote ( i 'll hopefully vote on the next elections ), 
  username and content is 54/10 . 
  i like you already . 
  can we add belgium , luxembourg , and the netherlands ? 
  luxembourg and belgium already half-speak a romance language and the netherlands is just a bro . 
  * it 'll be as if you never left , darling . 
  consider this : the uva is * the * best university in the netherlands , 14th best in europe , and around 50th in the whole world . 
  considering you are doing arabic and islamic studies you 'll likely be in my faculty which i can say from experience it 's * really * damn good . 
  be wary of titles like `` arabic 2 '' , these do not indicate level at all , in europe we have 6 levels in the common european framework of reference of language that go like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_european_framework_of_reference_for_languages ) , arabic 2 in the uva is merely a reference to the 2nd semester . 
  french has a beginner , intermediary , and advanced course , they are all called french 1 and 2 depending on the semester . 
  for arabic i am not sure what levels are offered to be fully honest , nor do i know what level you have of the language . 
  portugal , although i have french dual citizenship as well ( lived there for quite a while ), 
  do it . 
  i have a couple of friends currently taking arabic , i can ask her anything you need . 
  in portuguese , spanish , french , and italian it 's europa . 
  i do n't think there 's any other name for it . 
  it 's today , yup !, 
  i can not vote because you need to be a dutch citizen , and i do n't have dutch citizenship ( yet ) . 
  ... i am not a smart man . 
  sorry about that xd, 
  it 's the other way around in clearly superior nl ( should 've added an / s to it , sorry ) . 
  ** heresy ** ^ / s, 
  netherlands : cold to the right , hot to the left . 
  very welcome !, 
  join me if i ever can afford to go ( it 's very expensive , haha ), 
  oh god that circlejerk subreddit is just so funny for me . 
  it 's extremely just overly nationalist jokes but by god we love em . 
  i find the history of communism fascinating , and to be able to fully see it for myself , to meet basically a baby ussr from the 1970s , it 's a big opportunity for me . 
  it 's mainly an interest on this weird peculiar country , that somehow developped into its current form . 
  it 's * usually * 6h per course ( except language courses that vary a * lot * ) so usually it 's 12h of classes ( plus about 30 to 40h of personal work ) . 
  or 6h + anywhere between 5 to 9h of language courses . 
   portugal : its patriotism said spain . 
  what 's a belgium ? 
  do you mean zuid brabant ? 
  courses usually have one seminar ( 2h , assignments always required , sometimes reading as well ) , and two lectures ( 2h each , with always some reading required ) . 
  language classes are basically two huge seminars ( 3h , with exercises and reading ) for the * russian * language class but keep in mind that for french , for example , there are different hours and ways of function . 
  this is the case for every different language . 
   north korea . 
  last chance to visit a genuinely renegade dictatorship . 
  interested to see how the tour guides try and persuade you the country is `` normal '' . 
  eeeeeyup , i came here to basically say this . 
  weeeelp . 
  i happen to be in the uva as an undegraduate , and dude , ** dude ** , forreal , every single person here has different class schedules . 
  we have lectures that are common for everyone in our program ( in my case , european studies ) . 
  then we have seminars ( and language classes ) , where we are divided into groups ( about 12 groups for the english-speaking track ) and here 's where things get complicated : seminars for different groups are 99 % of the time at different times ( group 3 does not have seminars the same time as group 9 ) . 
  language classes ( since we need to choose one from the 15 something proposed language courses ) make this complicated . 
  language classes do not have groups nor lectures nor seminars , just plain classes ( sometimes we have two groups separating dutch and english speakers but they are always at the same time ) . 
  language classes can not change their time , so if you are in a seminar group ( which are decided before you even choose a language ) that happens to be at the same time as a seminar ( they are never at the same time as a lecture ) you are allowed to change seminar groups for the bloc * so you can attend . 
  * our semesters are divided into 3 blocs , 2 of them last 7 weeks , and the last one is shorter . 
  the first two long included 2 courses , and the last short one just one . 
  well , to be fair it actually works the other way : knowing * only * english is seen as quite a hefty hinderance in the job market here because everyone speaks it , whereas speaking english * and another language * is far better and more applicable since dutch people in general tend to have very little knowledge of most languages besides english . 
  if you have other skills , like you said , in the engineering field , then yes it 's a different story , you are primarily being hired by your qualifications rather than your linguistic skills . 
  it looks like a rapist van to me , and it seems so socially awkward to use too . 
  i 'm easily scared . 
  i hope so , but may 's statements for me sounds very alarming , like `` no deal at all is better than a bad deal for britain '' which , at least to me , seems like she 's ready to go * fully * out ( at least she menaces so ) . 
  i am worried about northern ireland because of the border question with the republic of ireland ( i feel like this issue really needs clarification on what brexit holds for that island ) and gibraltar i merely worry since gibraltar 's economy has become heavily intertwined with spain 's and again i have no idea nor information about a well-defined solution for it . 
  i think that britain is definitely wanting to focus on more global trade , and it 's true that higher standards for products can be a pretty hefty problem for those . 
  i am mainly worried about trade with the rest of europe , especially because the uk ca n't really get just any product from anywhere and northern ireland + gibraltar should really have a better say . 
  really ? 
  how do they work ? 
  my lithuanian friend said that the used to have them in vilnius a few years back as well . 
  that word was in a russian dialogue i had to study , when i googled what it was ... jesus those look pretty scary . 
  i really love south park . 
  plus i can not nor will i ever deny my undying passion and love for google products . 
  youtube , my chromebook , my phone ... 
  i just really like them . 
  as an owner of a nexus 6p , i already like you . 
  what ? 
  during the campaign there were * multiple * statements saying that the uk would remain in the common market , hell , even i remember * farage * out of all people saying it ... 
  how do british people feel ? 
  i know that freedom of movement merely was not a thing that the uk was willing to accept and that the eu was not willing to given in on , but do you think that the common market is more or less important for the british than that ? 
  still does n't answer my question , i do n't see any mandate on neither side ... 
  what results ? 
  britain voted to leave the eu but i do n't remember any word on the common market or anything . 
  ( genuinely asking , i do n't remember much about the discussion on soft vs hard brexit ), 
  american exceptionalism for me is that view that * some * americans have of america as being exceptional and on a different league than anyone else . 
  basically the `` oh we are the best country , why should we follow wto rules ? '', 
  is a thing i can imagine out of it . 
  basically just a far-right weird discourse that always praises whatever ` merikuh does with sometimes blatant lies and whose goals are to uphold america to a standard it does * not * meet ( let 's face it , every country has issues ) , while downplaying every other country as inherently inferior for not being america . 
  * very important note : * not all americans believe this crap , most likely not even a majority of americans , for me this is mainly an * idea * that is very often used to push political goals . 
  thanks for the correction !, 
  my russian teacher told me i have a beautiful pronounciation of the language today . 
  shame i still am quite slow while reading . 
  99 % sure you can fully do this as both countries are part of the schengen space . 
  this means that if you have a tourist visa for one schengen member you can visit all others with no problem . 
  if you have a work visa or residence permit , i * think * you can still land in germany just fine and then go to the netherlands , but you will not be allowed to work or reside outside of germany ( but please do check , i 'm not fully sure ) . 
  edit : ** pay attention to u/dalnore just below **, 
  ** sad !, 
  i really really * really * dislike overly complicated logos . 
  this can be applied to anything , but mainly coat of arms , every time i look at something too complicated i 'm like * ugh can this thing just visually chill ? * . 
  i do n't really have a reason for it , but yeah i 'm anal about good graphic design . 
  i personally do n't think it 's that much different than from the us about how we feel about certain jobs . 
  if you want actual statistics then it 's best to check per country ( insee for france for example ) what types of jobs are the biggest and the smallest proportions of employment . 
  i am not sure , and i do n't think there 's an actual pan-european statistic of that type ( i wish ) . 
  in russian class , i have an american and an english classmate . 
  the american one can pronounce russian much more easily due to the fact that american english has far less aspiration of the letters and so it 's easier for her to pronounce stuff like \u041f\u0435\u0442\u044f , however my english classmate struggles a lot because she can not help but aspire every . 
  single . 
  consonant sound . 
  ever . 
  it genuinely becomes problematic , and the same goes for * some * vowel sounds here and there ( pronouncing \u0451 as yoowww instead of y\u00f3h ) .
