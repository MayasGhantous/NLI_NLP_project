  * goodbye , my love , we shall meet again . 
  i * think * i 'd opt out for the left-wing regime myself . 
  there is no good choice but personally i feel like it 's the lesser of two evils ( but still ... ), 
  well , it depends , there is no 100 % capitalist economy in the world , every economy has its restrictions and regulations with state interventions in various forms and extents . 
  i 'm still not sure what you mean about poorer eu countries , especially since the eu imposes a lot of regulations and legislation that effectively make countries grant benefits such as healthcare and education to all its inhabitants . 
   socialism per se is considered to be an alpha and omega in most of the western european countries in the eu . 
  huh ? 
  1991 happenned ...  would it be possible for a country to break off and go full capitalism ( low taxes , low social security ) in order to compete with a socialist country in order to reach the same/similar level of wealth faster ? 
  i highly doubt it since social security is still a * very * big thing in europe and not only that , we do not want to live the same lives that people in those said countries have to . 
  unable to afford healthcare or education is an extremely bad sight for us , so i doubt it will ever be an actual thing in nearly all of we . 
  i 'm not even sure i 'm understanding the question , * what * socialist country would we be up against ? 
  the closest you may get is perhaps the uk , with a more `` laissez faire '' attitude towards education . 
  but even then , the nhs is not going anywhere by a long mile . 
  keep in mind that we still have a capitalist economy , we are social democracies , not socialist states ( thank fuck ) . 
  * inhale * ** willeeeeeeeeem **, 
  same here , ziggo ? 
  well , not exactly . 
  he will be checked if he travels by plane , everyone is checked ( even domestic flights ) . 
  how do russians generally feel about the ukrainian situation ? 
  also , do russians care much about belarus ( about the union state thing and such ) ? 
  i find him to be really funny though . 
  i mean , he 's just a comedian playing a character , plus i love his cooking videos . 
  what 's bad about him ? 
  oddly enough , as a foreigner i absolutely love it . 
  sure it 's hard to learn but c'mon it so cute and pretty . 
  sexy , and perfect tanlines as well . 
  dries quicker as well !, 
  i honestly do not like the american system currently . 
  i disliked obamacare because for me it was not strong enough and did not provide enough coverage for its citizens , and i am * very * worried that even that is going out the window because trump and the republicans want to propose a new one that is even worse ... 
  i just wish that america could just have a nice stable and reasonable system like the netherlands , and you may like it since it 's somewhat private as well . 
  the waits here are not at all awful , i got to a hospital in portugal and only had to wait about 30 mins for a surgery ( unbooked , unplanned , just walked in and discovered i needed one and bam , off i went ) . 
  i think that we have the means to have less sick people overall since ( and correct me if i 'm wrong here ) eating healthy is much more affordable in europe than in america , so that already eliminates a lot of potential health issues in my opinion . 
  if anyone proposed the american system ( which for a lot of us is synonym with `` non existant '' ) then i think it would primarily be political suicide , although reductions and cut backs on healthcare are not at all political suicide in europe and in some countries ( like the uk with the tories ) these are actually implemented . 
  i think that any fully developed country in the world should focus on education and healthcare , and the fact that america does not and everything costs so much money and throws people under mountains of debt is genuinely alarming from my perspective . 
  i understand the arguments it brings in theory , but i believe that in practice the ones who need healthcare or education the most are always the ones being left out , thus creating a vicious cycle . 
  i think that it is a stereotype that * does * exist and is applied to north americans but not at all everyone of you guys . 
  america did indeed brought the stoner culture things like 420 or blaze it and such , and there is a lot of bragging rights ( at least from my perspective ) in american pop culture when you smoke weed , like you 're a rebel or a bigshot . 
  so this , for me at least , creates this one stereotype of americans who smoke weed , like once , and then wo n't stop saying how stoned they are or how `` the kush was goood '' to appear cool , especially among younger people . 
  i do n't really tend to think about this stereotype that much , but whenever i meet younger north americans who think weed is `` sooo cooool '' and the be-all-end-all , yeah i tend to assume they are a bit like that . 
  i personally prefer the japanese extreme as i believe that cooperation and collectivism is a better way to live ( even if extreme from my perspective in the japanese case ) than entirely individualism `` every man for itself '' america . 
  i think we need each other to succeed and cooperation definitely is best . 
   i see the armillary sphere ( if that 's what you meant ) as a symbol of the discoveries , not of the colonial empire . 
  not that the discoveries were n't associated to land appropriation and enslavement of natives , but i do think these things can be somewhat separated . 
  yeah it 's what i mean but for me i see the discoveries as the start or the lead-up to the colonisation process that we later happened . 
  those were very different times in my opinion and it seemed perfectly normal to do what we did , but nowadays it is not so we should have a more emphasized separation between the two at least . 
   not to mention the moorish castles and the shields which i think have something to do with jesus supposedly appearing to d. afonso henriques almost 900 years ago . 
  that barely carries any meaning today , they 're just symbols traditionally associated to our country . 
  that is actually one of the symbols i really like , because for me it upholds portuguese history and carries , not meaning of religion or fuck the moors or whatever , but rather of the birthplace of our country , where it all sorta began . 
  it 's one i think we should cherish dearly . 
   i do think there 's an excessive glorification of certain portuguese achievements that still shines through in the narrative through which portuguese history is taught and commonly interpreted by us portuguese people , and , to get back on topic , i think it might be a lasting effect of the estado novo propaganda machine . 
  i think it 's definitely an interesting topic and i think you are right , we definitely have this overglorification of our history and our own narrative where portugal does no wrong 99 % of the time . 
  i think this is also valid for other countries ( france and the netherlands included ) . 
  i remember that when i was younger , portugal taught me that napoleon was basically a dick , whereas in france he is the holy grail ... so for me both sides need to chill and be more objective about it , nuance and explain that yes he did some great things like the civil code , but he very much also fucked others over . 
  same goes for portugal , we are the good guys * and * the bad guys . 
   ( sorry if i 'm getting a bit rambly , i 'm not responding directly to you anymore , just going on about stuff . ), 
  nah it 's perfectly fine , i think that what you 're saying is linked to what we were just talking about , and it is also interesting , so by all means go ahead !, 
  again , it is not * just * the estado novo , we already had a colonial empire before it did n't we ? 
  for me it is merely that our current symbols make reference to elements that no longer are a thing * since * the estado novo so for me , our symbols should change accordingly . 
  the cheese did sorta squeak when i touched it actually xd it was weird . 
  well , my friend was from toronto and she made it for me , so unfortunately no ^ ^ ^ ( t ^ ^ ^ yet ), 
  ** new lisbon **, 
  pick one language damnit !, 
  ( i still love you canadian cheeky dudes , poutine is bae ), 
  whatsapp , imgur , my university 's app , calendar , telegram , spotify , my bank 's app , fallout shelter , music , and alarm clock . 
   are you referring to the armillary sphere ? 
  i 'm quite anti-colonialist and the `` good '' imperial times but i fail to see how can you argue that the republican flag ( based the flag of a masonic secret society ) has anything to do with colonialism . 
  it literally has an age-old golden globe in it , which in portuguese portraits was used as a symbol of colonial expeditions for centuries  well our anthem is already that , at least is n't like the french or the british with clear references to war or submission to monarchy . 
  this again does not really seem like good examples since i do n't think that la marseillaise is representative of modern-day friend at all , and god save the queen/king is merely based just on the fact that they are a monarchy ( something we are not ) . 
   there 's your problem , portuguese school history still relies extensivly on estado novo 's myths . 
  stuff like being somehow `` better '' colonizers , salazar fixing the economy ( it 's easy when you tax everyone and repress any dissenting opinion ) and many others . 
  for me , i think it is important to nuance them , for example how the `` better colonisers '' were still really damn racist and provided burdens and devastation for native cultures . 
  yes these myths exist , but i think that it is important that we are taught mainly that yes he * did * fix some issues but at the price of what ? 
  that is the direction education in my school took , we focused on the `` good '' effect it had but demonstrated the amazing price it brought like a severely downgraded education , shutting up any dissident opinion , surpressing basically anyone who genuinely wanted discussion against censorship or even economic decisions . 
   about nazi germany , man you really should study how unsustainable the german economy was or how practically all nazi `` scientific discoveries '' did n't even met the scientific method . 
  yes , yet their research is still ( morbidly ) used since the data they gathered has given us greater understanding of certain human body conditions ( such as the body 's reaction to freezing temperatures or depressurization ) . 
   i disagree i do n't see how our symbols are reprehensible . 
  i wonder if you think the same about dutch national symbols . 
  i think this is 100 % subjective and your opinion is fully as good as mine . 
  i like the dutch national symbols however i also question a lot of them in the same way , like the part where they literally say `` i have always honored the king of spain '' or their slight pride over the voc logo ( dutch east india company ) . 
  all in all , i fully understand your perspective , and yes you can fully argue the opposite of what i am saying ; but my opinion is that the estado novo was a pretty damn sore spot in our history , and that the symbols we currently use no longer 100 % fit the image i have of my country , thus i believe that we should think about it as well . 
  i still like our flag and anthem , just that these thoughts still are pretty present in my mind and make me not fully want them as the end-all-be-all for portugal . 
  well for me i merely do n't think that having symbols of bloody colonisation should belong in our flag anymore . 
  portugal is past that , we are over it , and i do not believe it is something that should be constantly glorified . 
  furthermore , do we seriously need to talk about anti-anything in our anthem ? 
  i , for one , believe our anthem should be about the beauty and love for our country , not about * marching against cannons in sea and land . 
  * i repeated it because that is literally how i was taught history , and in my opinion it 's not 100 % wrong , but the fact is that it also brought horrid oppression and censorship alongside with it with the bloody estado novo . 
  it is important to note its advantages but also exactly why its over and the suffering it brought , just like i was taught about nazi germany ( hitler did bring german economy back up to its feet , and developed infrastructure extensively , and even progressed in science a lot , but * literally it was nazi germany * ) . 
  portugal is no longer the colonial republic we once were , and we no longer are anti-british . 
  we are better and i believe we deserve a better representation of our country . 
  i really dislike the greek government , but do n't feel the same way about greek people . 
  i think i like greek culture in general , even though i admit i do n't know a lot about it , you 've got nice food , a cool language , cute tiny islands , etc. . . greek people ... it 's weird but i 've only ever really met about 5 , sole thing those seemed to have in common is having this sort of `` clique '' with other greeks , speak * very * loudly , and also get dramatic very fast , the rest varied from person to person . 
  i honestly do n't know what to think about greece itself since it 's a mix of all these things and more that i probably do n't know about , all i really hope is that it gets back on its feet soon . 
  ** triggered **, 
  / thread, 
  i really like them , they seem quite nice and a beacon of that `` britishness '' some like . 
  other than that they are alright . 
  sole thing i hate about them is some racist remarks they made as well as * that whole diana issue *, 
  i think that a b1 is enough to survive , but keep in mind that duolingo is great to learn * vocabulary and common sentences * whereas grammar kinda misses the mark . 
  i think that if you tested a b1 in spanish and would like to come to spain , you 'll be absolutely fine . 
  my parents absolutely haaaate the estado novo , which makes sense since they were both born just a year before the carnation revolution .
