  in my school we were taught extensively about how it made our country stronger and solved lots of issues we were having with our past kingdom , plus also colonial development and such . 
  but very importantly they put strong emphasis on how it also brought censorship , oppression , and * a goddamn fucking dictatorship * as well . 
  for me the main estado novo that still affects me today is the history of our symbols like our anthem or our flag , which i wish we could maybe update to represent a modern post-colonial portugal . 
  for me , the estado novo started off as a solution to our issues with the kingdom of portugal , but it overstayed its welcome by a few decades , and even though it * did * bring some improvements , it costed important liberties and political rights , so yeah ... 
  started off well but went to shit * very very * fast . 
  that 's a bit mixed i think , it 's true that some parents are like that , it 's common , but it 's not 100 % a general rule , it 's a bit 50/50 from what i can tell . 
  though our schoolsystem definitel pushes us with that i think , high education or fuck off basically . 
  that is true for really old people who actually grew up in those times , but i thought the question was mainly about 40 + year olds and i was mainly referring to those . 
  i remember it was roger that went to uni , but then saw a discover advert nearby and changed his mind , then wanted to use his discover card to get a jacket or whatever . 
  i swear i saw an american dad episode where they get a discover card and can not use it so they go to an underground mall that is literally the 90s . 
  to answer your question , nah i do n't think europe accepts it at all . 
  it depends . 
  i was in school when i got a french course , so i 'm not sure it 's applicable to your case , plus it did n't leave me any time to explore the week ( it was basically 8-18h , just like regular school can be ) . 
  i do n't think that there are any * free * courses around but there are definitely free learning materials online that are very good and efficient if you take them seriously . 
  if you want to learn french in paris , [ this website ] ( http://www.parisinfo.com/paris-pratique/preparer-son-sejour-a-paris/apprendre-le-francais ) might be useful ( it includes different places where you can learn it ) . 
  well , i think that me and my friends do jokes in bad taste sometimes , but we 99 % of the time keep it to ourselves , i mean i 'm pretty aware that not everyone is comfortable with that sort of humor so it 's best to just keep it to who is . 
  oh god i did n't know it was gon na be land movements , i thought it was just taking all the stuff and people in one country and putting it into the other . 
  zwarte boek is an excellent dutch movie !, 
  drama in ww2 , what more can you ask for ? 
  new kids turbo is , like , really stupid humor , but i will admit it 's entertaining . 
  in my case i never noticed any tension in portugal and the netherlands between generations , i consider the older generations as merely normal , just like me , but grew up in a different time so sometimes ( mainly for portugal , not much for the netherlands ) they do not see europe the same way , and can be a little bit less open to more international stuff like studying abroad . 
  in france i notice an actual gap and a bigger tension , with millennials and older generations , especially when they speak about politics . 
  i am not sure why but i think the main difference that causes this tension is that the gap between progressive ( younger ) and conservative ( older ) ideas and opinions . 
  * important notice : these are all based on my personal experiences and opinions and thus are not really a proven scientific fact so take them with a pinch of salt *, 
  well , we created something ungodly in 1999 ... a titan among mortals , an unstoppable rating-stealing machine of a show . 
  we have created an unmatched * monster * ... and its name is ... ** big brother **, 
  never heard of it , do you mean south brabant ? 
  czechia is so cute , i really would love it it were next door . 
  i 'd also switch germany for ireland ( and take northern ireland with it too ) because my parents love ireland and if they visit me it would be awesome if we all could go next door and enjoy irishness . 
  welcome !, 
  i think it wo n't really be an issue at all , i know lots of europeans that sometimes compare trivial things to the holocaust . 
  for example i remember a friend who told me not to use the bathroom in his room because `` it smells like a shower in auschwitz '' and i just did n't really felt discomfortable . 
  i think that if you start saying that it was a * good * thing that happened or start speaking more specifically about the holocaust in general , then it 's a lot more taboo . 
  i 'm currently doing a bachelor 's degree on european studies , plus a russian language course as well . 
  ok firstly about social rights : you do n't get them just by barging into a country , you need to immigrate and get settled yourself , nobody is gon na throw any benefits at you . 
  i think this is very fair because it stops people from moving * just * for benefits . 
  firstly the work and contribution , * then * the benefits . 
  poland and romania are n't at all flooding the place . 
  are there immigrants from those places ? 
  yes , but it is n't a * huge * endless stream at all , it 's just people coming over and getting jobs ... 
  they tend to integrate nicely as they just work hard and generally do n't cause any disturbances at all . 
  i 'm portuguese , and admittedly portugal is n't the richest place . 
  in france ( where i first migrated with my mom ) we did n't get any benefits until we had a fully legal residence and she got a job and i got to school ( obligatory for minors in france ) . 
  i was treated just like any french person was because that 's what i was : equal . 
  when i moved to the netherlands , i have a perfectly legal residence but i do n't have a * job * so i do n't get most benefits that the dutch do ( it 's fair in my opinion ) but since i am a university student i get the benefits any other student here gets ( like paying a little bit less rent ) . 
  i think that our system is functioning , and that these `` floods '' from eastern europe are n't even a * small * issue , it 's literally just people moving in and getting a job ... 
  if we keep hiring them , maybe it 's because we need them . 
   how much does it cost for international student to study in europe ? 
  fees for eu and non-eu citizens are very different and vary from country to country . 
  in the netherlands for eu citizens it 's usually 2 000 $ per year ( or monthly payments of 200 $ ) , for non-eu citizens it 's around 8 000 $ . 
  you can easily get a student loan for this though . 
   are the courses in english ? 
  if you search for english courses yes , there are a lot of english courses all over europe ( except maybe sweden if you 're looking for a bachelors ) . 
   what are some good unversity for international students ? 
  there are very few non-good universities in my opinion . 
  it depends on what your expectations are and what you ultimately want . 
  a university in the netherlands operates very differently than a university in ireland for example . 
   what is a language other than english that most european speak ( thinking about learning a new language ) ? 
  again , varies per country but generally the three big languages of europe are english , german , and french . 
  it is best if you learn the language of whichever country you end up in , since you will use it every day and will allow you to integrate better . 
  ** perfect gouden regel **, 
  strength ? 
  by losing allies ? 
  greeaaat . 
  his muslim ban forgot to include countries that actually were the origin of infamous terrorists , even the ones who carried out 9/11 . 
  the us is n't stronger at all , its representation abroad is an entire contradicting mess to the point they are * losing * influence very rapidly due to extremely idiotic and ill-informed decisions . 
  sorry , you voted exactly for the opposite of what you just said . 
  and who exactly is `` us '' ? 
  do you want coal dust in your water streams ? 
  because he legalized that very recently ... great benefits right ? 
  free coal dust for all americans !, 
  so you * knowingly * voted for a destructive horrible man to be your leader ? 
  good for you i guess, 
  hello , i am the local portuguese representation committee . 
  we have now met . 
  ( also , it 's ginja and it 's best drank in a shot glass made out of chocolate ), 
  i welcome it when it 's merely appropriate to do so , but if it 's something small and you interrupt me * just * to correct me while i 'm trying to make a point , then please do n't . 
  golden rule i follow ( and prefer a * lot * when others follow as well ) correct me when the mistake is pretty big and you do n't understand what i 'm saying , if it 's noticeable but small , just wait until i 'm done talking . 
  i want my grammar corrected to the extent of its usage , if i need to be absolutely perfect during a speech rehearsal then the definition of `` big mistake '' becomes a big more broad , but if i 'm just having a conversation about how my friend drank so much he was still drunk for next day 's lectures then be more then just focus on comfortable understanding me . 
  i think that there are two ways of seeing corrections : i correct them and i am honest , or i do not correct them and i am not being a bitch . 
  it 's quite cultural , in portugal i do n't usually correct anyone if i understand them well , but here in the netherlands i * do * correct a lot more ( because they do the same for me when i speak dutch , and i appreciate it ) . 
  [ here 's a good start ] ( http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/ ) you can also just read his twitter and compare it to his interviews , he flips sides more than italy in both world wars , hell , even more than a pancake on a pan . 
  i still think he 's the biggest idiot to ever be in charge of the us ( and that 's saying something ) . 
  he is a completely shameless liar , and a disgusting businessman that bases his views on whatever gets him more money in the pocket . 
  a misogynist , racist , incompetent idiot , who can not even account for * proven scientific facts * is in charge ... great . 
  this is a stain in american history , and a big one at that . 
  my opinion has n't changed since , it just became even more solid . 
  so you like simple english spoken from a known liar ? 
  not to mention , you said this :  it 's tradition not stupidity . 
  you voted for a hypocritical mess of a sexist and racist contradicting oompa loompa and you think the reason is because he 's a plain speaker who says some inspiring things ... ** are kuntree is gud , are kontry iz da best , plis voot vore mii , i am beste ** you * seriously * want to reduce your own politics to * that * ? 
  i am portuguese so i am just gon na stand here in the corner eating popcorn . 
  luxembourg and france might have something to say . 
  yes , because wilders is obviously * the * representation of the whole netherlands , oh of course ... 
  it 's not like he 's never been in charge of anything but his own party and constantly gets berated and mocked . 
  do you think lepen , farage , and trump are 100 % crystal clear representations of their own countries as well ? 
  bulgaria must be represented by the national front for the salvation of bulgaria then right ? 
   do you think someone cares what you believe mate ? 
  you care enough to not only reply to me with comments and even create a thread ... 
  i reiterate : if you can not take answers , do n't ask questions . 
  again , give me one example .
