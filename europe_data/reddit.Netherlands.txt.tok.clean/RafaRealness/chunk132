  so far you 've been saying `` oh westerners this , westerners that '' without providing actual examples of what you 're saying ... 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong or right but i sure as hell am not going to believe a random dude who just says something with absolutely no substance or basis . 
  the netherlands has a lot of english speakers , here in amsterdam some people actually live here without speaking dutch . 
  it 's not at all going to be a barrier in the least if you study in the netherlands , the sole thing is that if you want to really make friends with locals , either you will want to be in the same class as them ( some dutch people apply for english programs to ameliorate their english ) or maybe learn a bit of dutch to be more social with strangers . 
  there is really no anti-american sentiment here at all , yes they do talk about politics , but they really are n't gon na hate you at all because you 're american . 
  there are quite a few americans in my university , they never really get treated differently than anyone else . 
  i highly recommend the netherlands as a place to study as the universities here are very good in my opinion , you are mere hours away from a trip to belgium , france , luxembourg and germany , the student life here is absolutely fantastic , and finding a part-time job without speaking dutch is perfectly possible ( i know a girl who speaks english with a very thick accent and fluent french , she got a job where the sole requirement is being a french native speaker , they also hire native english speakers ! ), 
  do look into other countries , like for example portugal and spain ( depending on what you want to study , it offers very good universities and institutions as well as vibrant cities ) , or czechia as well ( prague is a fantastic place as well ), 
  i 'm in the netherlands , and again , what the heck are you talking about ? 
  there are anti-moroccan sentiments that 's true , but i 've never heard about an anti-eastern european sentiment in the least . 
  give me one example of that being the case here in the netherlands . 
  worked great for us so far . 
  i may not be dutch but i am integrating , and that includes being * as incredibly stingy as humanely possible * so i never buy bottled water willingly . 
  i just fill up my bottle from the tap and bam , good to go . 
  our tap water is absolutely fine , super clean and steady . 
   nationalism in western europe includes anti-ee aside from the uk , who did that ? 
  ** nowhere is safe . 
  quick . 
  build anti-scottish daaaaaams . 
   sturgeons sturgeons are animals ? 
  holy crap they are . 
  what the heck is that thing tho ... does ... does it want independence ? 
  ** ikea everything ** i live in a teeny tiny apartment where i own a bed , a rug , a bookshelf , desk and chair , closet , and the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance : a huge fucking lamp . 
  it is by far more than enough in my opinion , i 'd even ditch the armchair and get one of those beds that fold into sofas , because then you have both a living room and a better way to have guests over , as well as a more versatile bedroom afterwards . 
  well , you 're not belgian , so why/how would you ? 
  also , i am pretty sure you can study in * the un * just fine , but assuming you meant eu , well , check your current citizenship and fees ( even foreigners are allowed to study here , they just pay bigger tuition fees , but we have tonnes of systems in place to lessen financial burdens ) if you want belgian citizenship one of your parents must be belgian and you need to be under 18 . 
  should you not meet these requirements then you must learn one of the belgian languages , integrate in belgian society , and live in belgium for 10 years . 
  let me ask you a question : do you seriously think that getting citizenship from a foreign country * just * to go to university is worth it ? 
  you can get student loans and visas quite easily for most eu countries that should lessen the burden but if you want citizenship just because you do n't want to pay up you might get some pretty bad reactions here . 
  i honestly only ever hear it in american media , which is n't surprising because it is in some sort of bubble where only the us exists as an actual democratic state . 
  as a result , i do n't think about it at all , it 's just like thinking about how americans insist its called soccer * which is fucking not and i care far more about it than how your refer to the us president * . 
  for me it 's silly and pure hyperbole ( plus i do n't consider the us * that * free by my own personal views ) but then again trump is president so i guess anything goes over there . 
  i 'm not saying anything , but the word leader in german * is * f\u00fchrer . 
  so is leader of the free world the new f\u00fchrer ? 
  brits for me is a bit of a matrioska word , like saying `` oh i 'm from europe '' i 'm like ... yeah but what part ? 
  northern irish people for me have a reputation of being angrier than others , bit of hotheads , but they are still quite kind . 
  they have a very distinct accent . 
  scots speak loudly sometimes , and again there is a very distinct accent that i find pretty but jesus sometimes i get confused . 
  they seem a little bit quieter than others i think . 
  generally helpful with small tasks although they do n't usually offer to help ( so ask ) . 
  englishmen are very mixed , they can be anything from a chav to her majesty . 
  they are usually very polite to you , however some are a bit spiteful behind closed doors . 
  they are the pinnacle of the `` british '' accent and speak beautifully ( except chavs , but that goes for every place on earth ) . 
  they offer to help a lot more than the others . 
  overall they are quite kind but not 100 % open and honest with their criticism sometimes . 
  welshmen hate being called english . 
  basically just reread what i said about the english but add `` and speak some welsh '' at the end . 
  sorry wales i honestly struggle to define you . 
  * keep in mind that these are not objective , these are my subjective views based on my own experiences and thus your view may vary *, 
  as a europhile , this woos me . 
  my identity is sort of a mixed bag , imagine it 's a building and these are the floors : 0-western european 1-portuguese + french 2-european union ( whatever term we use for it , unionian ? ), 
  3-european ( the continent ) 4-benelux 5-amsterdammer so i identify firstly with 0 , then 1 , then 2 , etc. . . 
  i have no idea what to call myself , so i just consider myself half portuguese half french . 
  inside europe : ** utrecht oh baby ** outside of europe : i ca n't decide between san francisco and taipei, 
  i mean , i am hyped over prague , bratislava , and krakov myself , everyone tells me they are absolutely awesome . 
  somehow everyone i know thought st petersburg is as depressing as 80 's ussr stereotypes . 
  well , in my experience that does n't really tend to be the case , british pensioners seem to gather up in spain and portugal more than anything . 
  well , it ultimately depends on what you want to see . 
  france is a more expensive option but it has that distinct southern france fantasy going on in the south , it is beautiful and very touristy as well , though i am not entirely sure the locals ' english is brilliant . 
  expect the usual tourist commodities but not super unique places ( i must admit it is a bit predictable at times ) . 
  portugal , on the other hand , is much cheaper , and ( depending on where you go ) people tend to speak english quite well . 
  tourism is a precious industry in portugal although it is also a little bit more recent , so expect the usual commodities but also a very direct contact with local living and tradition ( something that often goes out the window in extremely touristy places , like paris ) . 
  the sole real issue is that i am not 100 % sure if your little brother would enjoy portugal very much , due to the fact that there is merely not a whole lot to do for people his age ( depends a lot on what he enjoys doing i 'd guess ) but it is an optimal destination for you and your mother . 
  as for transport , please just take public transport or fly to your destination , it will either be the same price or cheaper but the convenience is * very * welcome . 
  the toll borders in spain are slow as hell and driving long distances can seem like a way to save money but there are some hidden costs . 
  ** foiled again **, 
  ** amen . 
  yes , but instead of britannia , say batavia . 
  everyone will be like britainnia ? 
  batavia ? 
  potatoes ? 
  as an outsider looking in , i think that it still reflects very important parts of dutch culture , and the symphony itself really portrays the netherlands as a happy peaceful place . 
  plus the part of history it refers to is extremely important dutch history . 
   english first , then british , then european . 
  you , my friend , would make for a really cool looking matrioska . 
  very true , there is also the more typically dutch utrecht but it is quite small and more relaxed and quiet than amsterdam , it also hosts quite a few interesting museums like the spoormuseum . 
  we also have the hague that is very close to rotterdam and it has really cool beaches , again , that typical dutch look , the famous madurodam , and also boasts a large number of famous organisational buildings if thats your thing . 
  vive la france . 
  oh my god my whole comments in this are a trainwreck xd, 
  * the thirst is significant *, 
  we say caralho in a horridly huge number of occasions , in that case it means `` fuck yeah portugal goddamnit wooo '' and i am 100 % serious that is what we mean by it emphasys ? 
  ** caralho ** excited ? 
  ** caralho ** caralho is the best word god has ever created it 's great , everybody tells us so . 
  this alone makes me want to learn czech . 
  * i like the way you think * , sex met sex svenskes uhm ... mensen ? 
  ** ghello naughty children time to learn some portuguese ** pila = dick pilha = battery caralho = big dick carvalho = popular last name puta = thatcher 's mom buda = bhuddah to say something is really damn far we say it 's in judas ' ass ( no cu de judas ) which for us makes sense because judas was somewhere in the middle east and we are all the way on the edge of west europe . 
  to say `` oh fuck '' , we say `` fodasse '' which is sooorta `` let it/this be fucked '' ^ ( so poetic ) we have a lot of expressions just like those ones , and it is hilarious . 
  yes , in portugal . 
  i grew up with summers like that so for me it seemed pretty normal at times . 
  in schools we 'd take this opportunity to have water bottles and surprise-drench someone in water just for fun , hehe . 
  i think aside from the `` stay hydrated '' bit , i did n't do much else differently . 
  til , that 's interesting actually . 
  i just let out a high pitched scream . 
  * that sounds horrifying , like , jesus christ *, 
  the video made me laugh , it claims `` supremacy '' and says something that , at least for me , sounds really mild . 
  i did n't hear anything that shocked me at all ( then again i 'm iberian , this is how our politics roll ) . 
  i think the netherlands has a very very small separatist movement for friesland , which is one of our provinces that speaks frisian and has frisian culture . 
  it 's a really small movement , i 'm not even sure if it 's active or not ... france has corsica whose nationalist separatism has quieted down compared to a few years ago , and i think britanny had something similar but , again , very small . 
  portugal , well ... 
  i ca n't really think of any .
