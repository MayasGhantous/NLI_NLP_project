  the country is very homogenous compared to other european states and also very small , so it 's quite hard to fund an actual nationalist separatist movement . 
  damn !, 
  sorry , did n't even notice that one , thanks for pointing it out !, 
  in portugal it is mainly just called os estados unidos ( the united states ) ; in france it 's les etats unis ( the united states ) ; and in the netherlands it 's de verenigde state ( the united states ) . 
  in portugal sometimes we say a am\u00e9rica , it 's not uncommon at all to hear it , but it is used less often ( like , about a third or a fourth of the time ) , in france it 's the same case with l'am\u00e9rique . 
  i am not at all sure for the netherlands though . 
  do keep in mind that this is merely based on my observations and conversations though , i think that this is one of those questions where i can easily see everyone disagree with each other but because it 's a bit subjective and personal to each one 's experiences . 
  unless you have a nice place where it ca n't easily be reached ; or even two locks ( thieves give up very easily if the bike is even slightly harder to steal ), 
   flemish ( vlaams ) , also called flemish dutch ( vlaams-nederlands ) , ** belgian dutch ** ( belgisch-nederlands [ \u02c8b\u025bl\u0263is \u02c8ne\u02d0d\u0259rl\u0251nts ] , or southern dutch ( zuid-nederlands ) , refers to any of the varieties of the dutch language dialects spoken in flanders , the northern part of belgium , by approximately 6 million people . 
  err ... are you sure ? 
  that group name sounds like csi : tallin i swear . 
  `` chief , our victim was crushed by that bolder over there '' `` looks like he was * estoned , ja ? 
  * '' ** j\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4 ** ^ ( do n't judge my bad puns too harshly i really tried okay ? ), 
  well , dutch has the [ dutch language union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_language_union ) though we share it with belgium ( they have their own language called flemish , though belgian dutch is also used to describe it ) spanish is regulated by * multiple * entities but overall the [ association of spanish language academies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/association_of_spanish_language_academies ) portuguese is regulated by a * lot * of different institutions , namely the [ cplp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/community_of_portuguese_language_countries ) , the [ lisbon academy of sciences , class of letters ( for european portuguese ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lisbon_academy_of_sciences,_class_of_letters ) , and the [ academia brasileira de letras ( for brazilian portuguese ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/academia_brasileira_de_letras ) and i am pretty sure every country has their own regulative institution , but from these examples you can see that a language can have just one ( like french ) it can have a union of them ( like spanish ) or just downright have a bunch of them ( like portuguese ), 
  ** and i would drive 100 miles and i would drive 100 more to be the guy who drove 200 miles to visit the ** building where kenedy was ... assassinated ... 
  sorry i was super happy that finally that song was relevant but then yeah , poor kennedy . 
  to answer your question , it 's not that long for a day trip , but for anything else i think it would be quite too long . 
  depends also on the traffic , and the country [ ( 1km in belgium is as horrid as it sounds ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a0w8els.png ), 
  i personally think that americans , just like us , are individuals , so on a 1 on 1 basis i judge an american based on how/who he is * personally * on a general level , i do n't give two fucks about skin color , and if i 'm gon na judge american people as a whole , it 's gon na be * as a whole * so that includes any race at all . 
  if we are going with your definition :  family oriented as in families are pretty close together , people do n't move out until marriage or a job requires it , grandparents live with their children and grandchildren , large family gatherings , etc. 
  i do n't mean anything involving government or or a code word for something prejudiced , but that families stick together and always try to find an excuse to be together . 
  then my dear friend you are going to be * very * disappointed as those are considered way older ideas here . 
  usually these are things more in southern europe where living with your parents is n't as bad a thing as in northern europe . 
  in my home country ( portugal ) people my age still live with their parents quite often and do n't move until * possible * ( we do it because we are poorer and houses are expensive ) whereas my french mom consistently wanted me to be stronger and more independent . 
  i also noticed that my portuguese family , for french standards , gathers a lot more than french ones and * compared to dutch ones the difference is amazing * . 
  sole exception to the rule i think is poland , but again , none of those countries really have that strong morality , hell , at times i think none of us want to live with our parents but we do it due to our range of possibilities ( money , house market , etc. . . ), 
  not amsterdam . 
  everything that is not amsterdam . 
  there are lots of places that are not at all very touristy all over the netherlands , for example utrecht has a fascinating train museum , it 's an awesome city as well . 
  and this is just an example , every part of the netherlands i feel has something unique and awesome to offer and visit , but lots of tourists seem to limit themselves to amsterdam and madurodam ( not even the hague , * just * madurodam ) . 
  if you 're interested in greenery and natural views , the netherlands has beautiful ( flat ) fields of tonnes of stuff , i highly recommend visiting a tulip field in person , it 's amazing . 
  i usually do it but just for myself , and it is mainly just so that i can remember a tiny little bit what their languages are like , plus i think it 's fun . 
  i do n't think , however , that we should start renaming everything as it would create heaps of confusion , grave difficulty for pronounciation , etc. . . english names remain english names , french names remain french names , etc. . . 
  it 's clear and easier this way . 
  ** this is why we the people \u00ae decided to vote leave ** / s, 
  agreed , it 's definitely cheaper . 
  i absolutely love it tbh , its such a ridiculous thing ; god bless . 
  and in the uk !, 
  remember that the eu is actually a german dictatorship whose goals is to eat british babies for breakfast . 
  whereas in the netherlands we have an ever-growing geert wilders , he is not as big of a problem for multiple facts : if he wants to be our leader , he needs to form a coalition to then have a majority ... but other parties already refused to enter a coalition with his party ( pvv ) and if he enters a coalition , he will be forced to compromise . 
  plus , some of his bigger promises are actually anti constitutional , so they will be extremely hard or even downright impossible to change without an overwhelming support . 
  basically , he may be the biggest party , but when the rest of voters are choosing parties that are not cooperating with his ( or at least not to a fully submissive extent on their part ) then he ca n't really hurt us that much . 
  do n't get me wrong though , i still think we should be very very wary of this guy , especially because i do not know what the mechanisms would be like to leave the eu in the case of the netherlands , and if he has that power . 
  plus i 'm an immigrant , and although he never talked about my country in particular , i am pretty damn sure that whenever ( if ever ) he gets rid of muslims , i 'm next . 
  i would n't advise montreuil , i lived there before and uhm ... things are a bit rougher over there . 
  there is a similarly distance town from paris that also takes 20 minutes by rer , called nogent sur marne , and if you get bored they have quite a choice of activities themselves , plus they are closer to disneyland !, 
   hotel ? 
  trivago . 
  this shit is spewed in every european country i live in , and it 's pronounced quite differently but spelled all the same , so when i read it my mind just crashes ... 
  for paris , i recommend you try out getting yourself some crepes with nutella whenever possible , there are lots of street vendors near the eiffel tower and i am pretty amazed at how many people seem to never try it out , even if it is a very tasty treat . 
  buy tickets in advance , seriously , lines for stuff in paris are ridiculous , so already having your tickets ready is definitely worth your while . 
  i 'm pretty sure any research on google about paris will give you tonnes of things to do ( it * is * the world 's most visited city after all ) though some of my favorites are la cit\u00e9 de l'architecture et du patrimoine , which hosts lots of stuff relating to french culture and architecture , and it 's close to some other museums/expos as well . 
  i do n't . 
  not because of choice , it 's mainly because i do n't care , and there are not a lot of them here in amsterdam . 
  case and point : norwegians and swedes cut their grass , danes [ ** smash it ** ] ( https://satwcomic.com/mower-of-grass ), 
  i am southern european , so my opinion is pretty biased . 
  in southern europe , it is basically a political shitfest and we all need bloody reforms , some more than others . 
  we all somehow manage to fit that stereotype of yelling loud politicians who do n't do much to get us out of the economic problems we face . 
  eastern europe : fucking hell what the fuck , it 's like , not super democratic , and some politicians are very extreme with their actions while they try to blame everything on everyone and make incredibly ridiculous claims ( i heard pis accused walesa of negotiating with the communists like that was a bad thing , and romanian socialists saying that the recent protesters were being paid to be there by the opposition ) . 
  it is just ... 
  i mean they are making progress , economically and politically ( though slowly ) but socially ... yeah no , thus generating the problem since if you do n't have social evolution in a democracy ( at least in my opinion ) you will not politically move from where you are now . 
  am in amsterdam , can confirm . 
  yup , it 's also worth mentioning that the dutch government and banks provide very good and cheap student loans and grants , and you can pay your tuition monthly ( 200 $ per month for 10 months ) so if you take a small part-time job it is easily affordable as well . 
  not sure if they provide loans for second degrees . 
  i always thought of him as some sort of marsupial , after all , he * is * partly indonesian ( and no amount of hairdos will cover that up ), 
  no do n't it 's a trap !, 
  you will be stuck to it and he will absorb your energy !, 
  well , maybe consider more the courses rather than the approaches , because here in dutch universities you always have hands-on experience with most materials in close groups ( seminars/tutorial groups ) that are more close with their relationship between lecturer and student and as a result provide closer tutoring in specific courses of action . 
  as for the type of classroom inquiry , that 's nearly always garanteed depending on the course . 
  in arts-related studies you will surely find something that matches that description , but not in , for example , medicine . 
  so i think that based on what you are looking for , the university of amsterdam ( the biggest in the netherlands ) fits the bill quite well , and so does leiden , and any other major dutch university ( not university of applied sciences , those in dutch are called hogeschool and are something different ) . 
   t 's temporary programmes and approach to teaching art , and critical theories surrounding it all . 
  seems very . 
  on traditional from my perspective . 
  how is this specifying anything at all ? 
  from my perspective , there are tonnes of art schools in europe with varying methods and values regarding content and education . 
  i 'm sure there is one for you but if you are asking to find an actual school you will need to be more specific or alternatively just apply for the most popular and usual dutch hogeschoolen and universities . 
  again , the hell do you mean by '' radical '' , the example you provided was just a regular arts school here ... be more specific about the characteristics you are interested in , because by these standards , even my middle school was radical . 
  oh yes , i forgot about that one . 
  well , with the appropriate visa , funds , and study application i 'm pretty sure that 's manageable . 
  i think there 's lots , i really appreciate rupaul as a gay rights figure , mlk as well , bill gates is quite admirable too , eisenhower , and a few more , but i think that 's enough . 
  amsterdam is known for its openness to virtually anything ( sometimes too much in my opinion ) . 
  berlin is very open as well , although it is n't so blatantly everywhere , they have a calmer but still very open and liberal city . 
  my guess is you mean more accepted social norms that tend to be taboo in some cultures , like sex culture , or marijuana usage , homosexuality , etc. . . 
  ehm ... that 's pretty common in the netherlands , even in my university in the humanities faculty it 's quite like that , it can be interesting for you to look at other dutch universities ( though i imagine it might be similar in other european countries , though maybe not france ) . 
  well , as a student in amsterdam , i do n't get at all what you mean by a non-traditional school , since i do n't really see the sandberg institute as anything out of the ordinary at all ... 
  there 's tonnes of places like it all over europe , though do keep in mind that not all offer english programmes ( swedish universities for example have no english bachelors programmes ), 
  it really depends a lot on what you consider `` traditional '' for an art school , because keep in mind that there 's a plethora of choice in the continent , and it really depends on what you call a traditional one as opposed to a non-traditional one . 
   i 'm an iowan , so even knowing that much should impress someone . 
   not since google exists , mate . 
   born in ussr ** i was not ready for that holy fuck ** awesome selections though !, 
  as for poland , it was either that or that eurovision song about being proud slavic girls xd, 
  my best guess would be they are either exceptions , or holders of us citizenship ( there 's lots of europeans living in the usa , as there 's lots of americans living in europe ) . 
  edit : i think that these agencies cooperate with each other quite often at times , so perhaps they were part of an instance where nasa and whichever agency they work for actually worked together . 
  * one of us one of us * one of us one of us ** one of us one of us ** ** one of us one of us **, 
   studies show gays are more intelligent on average so we have to keep those genes in the gene pool let us have in vitro babies more easily . 
  you get your `` smart '' babies and we get babies in general . 
  it boggles my mind that this scientific method is still so patched down because it 's deemed `` unnatural '' and yet people complain we do n't have kids , * it 's not like we can adopt as easily as straight couples either * . 
  i think that being gay should be treated like it is in the netherlands : literally nobody gives two shits , you get equal rights and you are treated * equally * , you are n't better nor worse . 
  alan turing is a great example of just what these ideas of `` stay in the closet , have babies for the sacred motherland '' will degenerate into in my opinion .
