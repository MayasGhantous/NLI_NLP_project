  ; and also a reminder as to how far gay rights have come since then . 
  in , let 's say , 1995 , being gay still did n't grant you equal rights here , and now in 2017 , i can get married in portugal , spain , france , the uk , the netherlands , sweden , slovenia ... and even adopt children with my partner in some of those , all while feeling safe and equal . 
  it still saddens me to see that this effect is n't a fully general one , and parts of society , and other societies in general , have yet to really overcome different sexual orientations . 
  i personally have a polish friend who is very accepting of me , but he explains that in poland ( due to religion and such ) being gay is * still * a very bad situation to be in and there 's no way in hell i 'll have it as good as western europe in the next 5 to 10 years * at least * . 
  so it does n't surprise me that cases like him exist , it 's just an extremely sad fact . 
  sorry for the rant , i genuinely am just passionate about it . 
  as a gay guy myself i feel both mad and sorry at that guy . 
  firstly because i think that getting out of the closet and feel safe and confident on yourself is * very * important to a lot of gay people , and in most western societies ( canada , france , the uk , the netherlands , sweden ) this is usually not a problem , i really do n't see how gay rights affect western society . 
  i feel quite sorry for them because maybe they were taught to hate that part of themselves , to never properly acknowledge their differences and to always think `` i 'm defective , it 's my fault '' instead of thinking of being gay as something natural . 
  homosexuality is found in literally hundreds of species in the world , homophobia is found in just one . 
  in portugal we have a lot of those , i watch them with my dad a bit for humor because it 's really horribly produced and awful , it 's funny . 
  it 's a big thing there at least . 
  all the schools i 've been to in france had both ( sometimes also the d\u00e9partement 's flag ) . 
  no idea if it 's mandatory but i appreciate it . 
  ... i googled him , and yes , he 's hilarious . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  i 'm really shocked that a gay man would work for a party that directly opposes his rights , but hey , takes all sorts of crazy people so that we know we 're sane . 
  the heck does he say ? 
  i often wondered what a luxembourgist extreme right party would look like ... can you imagine having your own version of geert wilders ? 
  i think it would be pretty hilarious . 
  i stayed with these very charming fellows in berlin for two weeks , both old people from the ddr . 
  they remember it it in a mix of fondness for it ( ostalgie ? ), 
  but also remember all the significant improvements they have now . 
  curiously they only spoke german , no english at all ( although they both spoke some russian and the one from dresden knew a bit of polish , that 's how east german schools rolled back in the days i guess ) . 
  then i met their grandsons and ... jesus the contrast is amazing , they were my age and spoke english and german ( nothing else ) and they do n't ever think at all about the east/west divide , plus they even complain all the damn time about germany like they are a deprived poor les miserables remake ... 
  i have * no * idea what to call the two of them , but in my experience there was this huge generational gap between the berliners : older ones were more calm , talked about the former divide , and recognise that times generally have gotten better and better ; and the younger ones do n't really stop wanting more and more and basically see no progress . 
  ... * but what if it 's your one-way ticket to be nordic ? 
   in france , you ca n't dehumanize people as much as trump did true , though i 'm pretty sure she would have if it was more allowed . 
  my aunt once was complaining about politics ( she 's * very * poorly educated ) and she said she 'd be voting for lepen `` to get the immigrants out '' ... 
  i had to remind her * she 's portuguese and so am i , we 're as foreign as everyone else , the sole difference is that we 're less on the spotlight since the 70s *, 
  i sometimes do , when i can no longer be bothered actually . 
  also ,  do it the * southern brabant * way !, 
  70 80 and 90 ... forreal . 
  portuguese native speaker here . 
  romania has the * best * deals , they are great , they are absolutely great let me tell you . 
  you bring your dog , and they pay you extra , it 's amazing , they give you cash , brilliant . 
  soros is by far the best romanian , bigly . 
  who ? 
  that one screenshot makes me want to cry , that 's so fucking inefficient i ca n't even ... 
   avoiding the use of gendered pronouns ( using xs in the place of vowels ) . 
  as a portuguese dude who speaks spanish ... ** how do you even speak any iberian language like that it makes no sense **, 
  ah damn , you 're absolutely right !, 
  i 'll correct it right away . 
  i * think * there might be a tiny difference between regions , i wonder how other people from other regions say it ( a\u00e7ores be like breushewshh ), 
  i think this makes sense but i 've never really said bruxos nor heard it , so maybe it 's more of a regional thing ( i 'm from greater lisbon and we say bruxo/a there ) . 
  it always is , and again , if you ca n't take the answer then do n't ask the question . 
  this is r/askeurope and on the sidebar that this is a subreddit for `` questions for a european , about europe or anything europe related '' whereas yours is a repetive annoying request spammed over and over . 
  be more creative , your loved one deserves more than just silly pictures . 
  it 's not just a `` no '' it 's a `` stop posting this here '', 
  for portugal there 's a really obvious answer : ** the lusiads ** by vasco cam\u00f5es . 
  nowadays it 's a bit awkward to read ( in my experience ) as it reflects some very ethnocentric ideas and most of vasco 's arguments on why portugal is basically this `` underestimated supreme titan '' are no longer valid at all . 
  it 's important to note that it 's from 1572 and we 're a nation that has been around since the 1170s ( afaik ) so definitely there 's been a * lot * of change , but this was definitely one of the most influential cultural works in our culture . 
  is n't it depending on who you 're talking to ? 
  i say bruxa for girls and bruxo for guys ( never really used/heard the plural ) . 
  i 'm not , i 'm originally from portugal !, 
  i 'm still trying to get better at dutch , but i understood you just fine , so either language is quite fine !, 
  ( i just do n't really know how to say much of what i mean just yet , unfortunately ), 
  no idea , it 's what i was taught to sing by my dutch colleagues , they told me the first one is usually used the most but sometimes they also sing this one as well . 
  oh hush , there 's a guy in my class that 's only a year younger than you , and he 's basically in the same `` age category '' as people my age . 
  you 're not that old . 
  i looked her up , she seems like a very brave woman . 
  rightfully so , to be honest . 
  i really dislike wilders but he deserves to feel like his life is not being endangered ... 
  i 'm not familiar with hirsi ali actually , who was she ? 
  i was born in 97 , and after reading up , yeah that was the worst thus far for portugal . 
  i was looking up dutch events from 1997 onwards , and i have to agree that this has proven to be possibly the worst ; especially due to its long-term consequences . 
  what 's so dark and shady about germany nowadays ? 
  i absolutely love the dutch anthem , i know the two main verses by heart and sometimes hum it to myself . 
  i also know the first verse of the french one ( i love it but jesus it 's violent as hell ) and the portuguese one ( little bit colony-friendly under my interpretation ) i also know the anthems of sweden , denmark , norway , germany ( and also the former ddr ) , the uk , russia , poland , czechia ( my favourite one by far ) , japan , korea ( both ) , and australia , with varying degrees of words missing/mispronounced . 
  and as you 'd expect i know the eu anthem in german , english , latin , and i 'm trying to learn it in french and polish . 
  they somewhat did , my mom could have just stayed in portugal ( which she prefered ) and i 'm still very grateful to my dad for letting me go elsewhere ( letting your kid go abroad for years on end ? 
  that 's very big sacrifice for any parent ) my problems were mainly teachers who do n't really give a shit if you 're learning or not , and education that is n't really up to par with other countries nor did it really offer me any perspective of a good future , instead i was considered average and at some points mentally challenged ( without any basis for it other than `` i 'm quiet '' ) . 
  i was n't really given an opportunity to learn in there , it was more like `` learn these things by heart '' and then next year it would be entirely useless . 
  i wanted to learn some actual practical skills , like how to fully speak a new , foreign language ( which has landed me very good jobs ) or maybe i 'd rather learn about politics without constantly having to hear about the portuguese case as if it 's the sole one on earth ... tl ; dr : i was n't really being taught anything that i was going to use in the future , and i had really bad teachers ( once my english teacher came to class drunk , and smelling like hangover 3 ) so i wanted to go to a place where i 'd be treated with more respect for my qualities ( and not just be called literally retarded just because i do n't participate in class enough ) . 
  eh , we 're pretty average , my mom got a job offer over there . 
  i just tagged along and * jesus * do i celebrate that day . 
  the sole links i had with france is a family that to this day i 'd rather not aknowledge ( one of them even * wanted * me to fail french high school ... ), 
  * the farage barage *, 
  thanks man !, 
  it 's like my old teacher always told me : `` quem esta mal , muda-se ! '', 
  i moved because of school itself because , in my experience , portuguese school quality was severely going down where i lived , and my mother is half french so i moved with her to france . 
  i 'm from a different municipality ( that i 'd rather not name , but we 're nearly neighbors ! ), 
  where school somewhat went to shit , especially in the late 2000s just before i moved . 
  nowadays my school has been fully remodeled and management was refurbished , so now it 's actually a very good school . 
  in either case , i still got more opportunities in france ( such as learning german and italian , and being part of the oib section ) than i 'd ever really get over there , so for me it was worth it . 
  * psssst * swim accross the channel so we can keep you safe !, 
  we 'll give you an honorary french status or something , hehe, 
  i tried to get into the oib section ( a very fancy baccalaur\u00e9at which you must get in by contest , and i passed that shiz gracefully ) and everyone thought i never would even make it to a bac g\u00e9n\u00e9ral to begin with because apparently portuguese people always do bac pro ... plus nobody thought i 'd pass the french exams with good grade because of my accent ( 16/20 thooo ) . 
  it 's just mainly being treated like i 'm just that one dumb stereotype that does n't know much , instead of actually being treated by my qualities . 
   in germany ( where i steal jobs and women ) i like you . 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  i 'm still pretty short so i do n't think it 'll be a hell of a bigger problem if i fall a couple of times . 
  i 'm considering getting my friends to teach me , they think it 's hilarious that i ca n't bike and really wan na see me try so yeah . 
  i think that definitely there was this great big gap between europeans in 1945-1989 that divided the place into two . 
  but * now * in the present , through cooperation and the end of communism , we are now far better off and united . 
  it 's as if there was one slice of bread with jam on it , and another with peanut butter on it , then afterwards * finally * they were put together and ** bam ** , sandwich . 
  ( that was funnier than i expected , so i 'm keeping it ) i do n't at all exclude the possibility of russia becoming more `` european '' and a better part of the family , it 's just that * right now * it 's not really happening . 
  i 'm not sure if russia really will come around and become more friendly with europe , but i sure hope so as i believe both sides have more to gain that way . 
  no fully entirely , because for me eastern europe is anything past germany ( except scandinavia ) but i see poland , bugaria , romania , etc. . . as the usual type of european but not russia . 
  i personally feel pretty neutral about it as i often forget the subreddit exists and i tend to disagree a * lot * with its views .
