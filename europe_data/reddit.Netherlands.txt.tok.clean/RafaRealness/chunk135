  my broader opinion is that it 's a shame to see a political place of discussion closed , but i 'd like to know the underlying reasons for this ban ( as i 'm pretty convinced there were a lot of them ) . 
  edit : explained in a bit more detail , like did someone get doxed or something ? 
  i was born and raised in lisbon , where although i had a perfectly fine life , i was n't very happy because my school was horrid . 
  my parents took note and i moved to paris , where i was much , * much * happier since i felt like school was truly something meaningful and this way i 'd actually have a shot at a future . 
  i had to face issues related to unfair stereotypes and language barriers , but overall i think it made me grow a lot as a person so maybe in the long run it was a good think ; and it never made me want to turn back because i kept telling myself : remember how school was in portugal . 
  then after high school , i did n't really like the french upper education system , because most studies were too france-focused for my liking ( i wanted something more continental ) and it was far too competitive for the quality actually being offered . 
  so i decided , it was time to move , and i made a list of all the countries i like and boiled it down to a shortlist of study programmes in 4 different countries : the netherlands , denmark , germany , and portugal . 
  i applied for them all ( and also for french universities as a backup ) and chose the best university i got accepted in . 
  and so here i am in the netherlands , as happy as i 've ever been , and not regretting for a second that one day i left . 
  russia for me is a mixed bag , because it 's * definitely * in europe , and it 's * definitely * historically european . 
  for me the border is clear , they are here in europe even if part of them is in asia . 
  now , i also see `` europe '' as a term that can include the eu as well , thus excluding russia and nowadays i feel like in language we use the russia vs europe analogy pretty often , sorta creating this line between `` our europe '' and `` russia '' , so somewhat excluding russia as a european entity . 
  i consider russia european , but i do n't consider it the * usual * type of european , same goes for belarus , yes it 's in europe but it 's different than most of us . 
  so the bottom line is : russia is european both historically and geographically , but it does n't really `` act '' typically european to me , and so belongs in this weird category of ... yeah i have no idea what to call them ... roommates ? 
  for a real debate i have no idea how i feel about turkey , because it 's very much historically tied with europe ( in both bad and good ways ) and * a teeny tiny amount of their territory that is less than the territory kazakhstan has in the continent is * is indeed in europe ... it 's really a very debatable subject, 
  i 'm open to suggestions to be honest , and i 'm bored as heck , so this * is * something to do . 
  i personally do n't think i should be doing much else , but since you think i should * probably * do then go ahead and suggest . 
  mainly from the `` then do n't read it . . '' bit and how aggravated you seem . 
  now with the `` condescending attitude '' then yeah sure . 
  you posted this same exact thing in how many other subreddits ? 
  here 's a list : r/marriage r/happy r/askeurope r/randomkindness r/casualconversation that 's already a * lot * and it 's pretty damn repetitive , specially since you 're not the only one , plus you came to r/askeurope which is n't really the place for requests of this type but for questions to europeans . 
  your question was `` can you help me make my wife 's valentines day special ? '', 
  and i , as a european , say no and explain why : because it 's the same exact spammed question posted in a lot of the internet , and here where it has no real link to europe ... again , do n't like the answer ? 
  do n't ask the question . 
  time and energy ? 
  dude , it 's a reddit comment , does n't take much to do ... secondly , you were apologetic before about this , and * sorry * you did n't get what you wanted but if you are gon na act like i 've insulted you because i told the truth about this repetitive trend that seems to be slowly spamming itself everywhere , then so be it . 
  if you do n't want answers , do n't ask questions . 
  uh , because you posted on r/askeurope , and this is my answer . 
  it 's not rocket science . 
  it 's the 5th thing of this type i see , can you please , if you 're gon na do this , just ask for a picture saying the city/country instead of the text ? 
  that way you can just use previously taken pictures for this purpose instead of asking for this stuff all the time . 
  sorry if i come out a bit mean , but honestly it 's getting a bit dull to read the same exact request all over the internet ... 
  ** nnnnnooooooooope ** i never regretted it since day 1 , and it 's been over 5 years and i still do n't regret it . 
  that 's very true , but those days are over and the netherlands is not at all the same country from those times . 
  it has since blossomed into a far better country without slave ownership or colonial ambitions . 
   sylvana simons oh god * her * , she single-handedly made me eyeroll so hard i popped a vein ... she thinks that the wealth of the netherlands is solely based on colonialism ... which ended how many years ago ? 
  i live in a very big black community , and race really has n't been an issue at all , everyone gets the same treatment ; yet by the way she talks about the netherlands you 'd swear it 's some bullshit socially regressive shithole full of hardline conservatives and white supremacists like one of those fanatic weird places in the us . 
  it 's like that zwarte piet debate , if you do n't like it then do n't participate in it ... ( i always thought he was black because he 's the first one to go down the chimney but whatever ), 
  * signed *, 
  no need to say sorry , you 're helping me out !, 
  i ca n't see the list , sorry !, 
  also , do you know any online resources for dutch grammar ? 
  the ones i found tend to be really unclear especially with word order ... 
  i sorta wonder how `` portuguese '' they are , like , it 's true that i never thought about them at all , nor do i know much about their side of history . 
  might do that this weekend , thanks !, 
  i do n't hate cycling at all , i just never learned how to do it , even though i really want to . 
  ** if i have to see that sticker one more goddamn fucking time i swear ** seriously , i love my country , but these guys give it such a horrid stupid name i ca n't , ugh . 
  oh yeah , i entirely forgot about them , i never met one actually , though i 'm curious to do so , and to visit the portuguese synagogue and learn more about it . 
  thanks for explaining !, 
  yeah it 's usually the ones from * that * community , which no matter if they do n't have citizenship , do n't speak portuguese , do n't really know much about the culture etc. . . 
  they * are still * portuguese to sorta fit in with that whole patriotic family thing . 
  i met one and he seriously weirded me out because he 'd only speak portuguese with me , even when i replied in french ( it 's france and we were with french friends , so it was super rude ) . 
  it 's usually dudes that are borderline just des raccailles ( not sure if `` lads '' is the same as it is in french but it 's close ) but with portuguese patriotism since they * sometimes * go on a holiday there . 
   the freedom ** m 'n vrijheid ** ** muh freedom **, 
  portuguese diaspora in france : either we entirely disappear and integrate ( undetectable undercover bitches , real sneaky ) . 
  or we form part of this annoying community ( mainly from bragan\u00e7a ) that is loud , does n't fully integrate , and is generally seen as overly nationalistic and tends to talk about portugal like the holy grail ; thus giving the french the stereotype of us being pretty dumb , very cheerful , drunk , and we all work in a construction site . 
  portuguese diaspora in the netherlands : i 've met so far 3 other portuguese people , they fully integrated here and i did n't even know they were my fellow portuguese dudes for 3 days until they asked me where i was from and were like `` oshit son me too '' . 
  the dutch do n't seem to care much for it at all , and the diaspora does n't seem at all visible . 
  keep in mind this is based on my own experiences and observations , different people may see it differently too . 
  my former username used to be `` i 'm not the one bitch '' , now i can change it to `` i am that one bitch '', 
  ah sorry , thanks for the advice !, 
  i 've always struggled with word order ( all other languages feature an entirely different set of rules so germanic languages other than english for me are difficult at times ) . 
  i wonder , what 's zooi ? 
  portugal/france , or as i 'd love to say ** europe **, 
  from portugal to france , and from france to the netherlands . 
  it 's gon na seem very self centered but hear me out , for me it 's the netherlands . 
  i 've never been this happy until i 've moved here ( not an overstatement ) so it 's gon na have to be nederland for me . 
  if we were supposed to pick a * foreign * country it 's definitely czechia , because not only do they have such a cute sexy language , but i 'm also really in love with their history , specially the communist era , i found it really interesting to read about . 
  i 'm not gon na post my damn address here xd ** bitch better not challenge a dutchie to a biking contest , seriously they are obsessed **, 
  ... i do n't have it tho . 
  i 'm fully healthy , never really had a problem , the sole thing is that i 'm not actually dutch !, 
  i 'm from the egocentric centre of the universe and the multiverse : amsterdam !, 
  no i mean i do n't know * how * to ride a bike , i just fall off to one side like a lazy cow . 
  this is probably gon na get me thrown in jail in the netherlands but i ca n't actually ride a bike . 
  i wish i could though , seems pretty relaxing and super practical . 
  ` ayyy !, 
  lem me know if there 's anything i can help you out with for the uva ; specially when it comes to organizing your arrival and such . 
  pis ( sorry poland ! ), 
  very good food , [ polish eurovision ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4gijf7poiu ) , general homophobia , ** solidarity ** , christianity , and my polish friends ' names, 
  `` you 're a developed country by mistake '' sounds like the most savage thing i 've heard so far , damn son , +1 to you ^ i 'm ^ stealing ^ that ^ one, 
  it 's being reported here in the netherlands : [ nos.nl article ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2155804-verdachte-aanslag-moskee-quebec-is-27-jarige-student.html ), 
  when i lived in paris , everyone used to say this : the best place to view paris is from the montparnasse tower ... because that way you ca n't see it . 
  * i think you mean zuid brabant , our very particular province *, 
  i 'm loving it thus far !, 
  it 's a great university in my opinion , and it seems to have a pretty good reputation ( even if people who studied in leiden for some reason call us lazy ... ) the university itself is very much organised and well performing regarding education , however * do * make sure that you take their housing assistance once you 're admitted , because finding a house in amsterdam is mission impossible 12 at this point , and they have great deals ( it 's probable we 'll be neighbours if you take an unfurnished room that you can keep for the duration of all your studies . ), 
  ...  `` it 's mainly a joke ... '', 
  for the netherlands , the universiteit van amsterdam , leiden university , vrije universiteit amsterdam , erasmus rotterdam , and university of groningen all offer english programmes . 
  i 'm personally in the universiteit van amsterdam ( just called uva usually ) and it 's really cool to be honest , we always have lots of people doing some smaller time here from around the globe whenever a new year starts for denmark , i only know that aarhus university and copenhagen business school are both pretty good , no idea for norway though . 
  best of luck !, 
  ** m 'n vaterland ** where was this taken ? 
  gorgeous picture . 
  lisbon/madrid/barcelona ( one of the 3 will suffice imho ) london/dublin ( again , just one ) paris/nice/strasbourg ( pick two if possible here ! ), 
  berlin . 
  ** do n't you dare miss berlin it 's quintessential for everything ever ** * optional * : brussels , amsterdam , frankfurt , cologne , hamburg , porto , oxford , manchester , glasgow . 
  a bit complicated !, 
  i am portuguese , and i lived in lisbon up until 2011 , then i moved to paris until 2016 , then i moved to amsterdam !, 
  i 've travelled a little bit here and there too , namely germany and spain and such ( once belgium but i was far too young to remember it ), 
  people here in amsterdam , when i moved in , were all very welcoming and friendly , but still dutch as hell so absolutely upfront with everything ( the second thing i 've heard more often in my first day around meeting people was how short i was , it 's awkward sometimes but they are just being fully honest ) spanish people tend to be very welcoming as well , and always up for a nice chat , from my road trips crossing their country , they are also very willing to help you whenever you 're in trouble , and they do so with a smile . 
  in amsterdam , there 's one thing that i advise all people to do : go to centrum , and walk . 
  do n't look at the direction you 're going , just go for the prettiest streets , and you 'll always find something to do guaranteed .
