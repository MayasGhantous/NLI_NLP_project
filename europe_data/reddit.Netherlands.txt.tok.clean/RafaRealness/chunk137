  soooo depending on what i 'm doing , either us english , russian , or dutch . 
  if it were cities only , i 'd move to utrecht so fast i 'd defy the laws of physics , i have a serious crush on that city ( and i 'm so glad amsterdam is n't that far so i can visit it all the time ) if i really need to change countries , either brussels or antwerp !, 
  i wan na stay close to the netherlands , and i really like dutch as a language ( french is a bonus too ! ) . 
  plus , belgium is really charming , besides the poor road infrastructure . 
  as a portuguese dude , a friend asked me what our relationships with spain are like . 
  i showed them this comment . 
  i 'm genuinely confused ... 
  i 'm imagining pots for plants ? 
  how does this relate to hell ? 
  what 's happening ? 
  * i 'm frightened *, 
  i was not aware this was a thing , but to be honest i 'd be surprised it if were n't . 
  i moved here recently and trust me , not speaking dutch is extremely pejorative here if you count on staying , and i agree with that attitude , you must learn dutch if you really count on fully being a part of social living in the netherlands , otherwise you 'll just be really seen as `` that foreigner over there '' and basically be not a whole lot better . 
  if you plan on staying , definitely learn dutch , and considering how helpful the locals are when you want to do such a thing , and the massive amount of resources , there 's no excuse not to . 
  and australia !, 
  strikes are a national obligatory tradition ( once my high school near paris was doing one of those silly student demonstrations that were really just a way for everyone not to go to class , they forced me to stand there even though all i wanted was to get my ass to maths class like a nerd hehe ), 
  the portuguese constitution used to say ( and i think it still does ) this gem :  `` the constituent assembly affirms the portuguese people 's decision to ( ... ) open up a path towards a socialist society which for me always struck me as odd as fuck all thing considered ... 
  * slams hammer * ** excuse me i 'm talking ** once i saw this girl try to sue her friend because her puppy dog accidentally peed on her dress and * bruh *, 
  is ... is that france or something ? 
  i better ask someone from zuid brabant . 
  judge judy is my favourite bitchy redheaded pineapple , god bless . 
  i love her so much . 
  that 's cute . 
  [ oh look , here 's a list with my country in it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_authoritarian_regimes_supported_by_the_united_states ), 
  joinin ' the club . 
  ... ok credit where credit 's due , you got me . 
  ... from the bottom ? 
  but ... how ? 
  am i the sole person who 's never seen someone do that ? 
  i 'm half portuguese half french and i live in the netherlands . 
  i have * plenty * of experience with stereotypes by other countries , and you as a belgian should too considering the massive stereotypes france and the netherlands have of belgian people, 
  [ ** expand ** ] ( https://pics.onsizzle.com/birb-expand-birb-e-x-p-a-n-d-3729970.png ) reminded me of this, 
  often at times , in my case at least , i leave the netherlands with transavia or easyjet ( something low cost * except ryanair , fuck that shit with a 7 inch cactus * ) and then come back with tap . 
  well , your environment is not representative of all the country , and in this thread alone there 's two different sources that agree that is on average around 16 . 
  as a practicioner of such gayetry , i notarise this with my utmost approval . 
  edit : okay not motorway sex jesus christ, 
  the velvet revolution was against communist rule in czechoslovakia , not really about the two splitting up ... plus , slovakia is n't slovenia, 
  well , they would n't be wrong xd i 've never been to any saunas , is estonia just like finland with those ? 
  where houses have their own tiny little saunas ? 
  i * do * get it though , i think it would be pretty weird for straight dudes to just hide their bits between them , like , it 's just a penis and you 're * in a bloody sauna *, 
  yeah , that 's right , however i think that geography is a liiiittle bit bendy ( sorry kazakhstan and turkey , i do n't see you as european at all , but cyprus and malta y' all my bae < 3 ), 
  * i do believe i found the secret spy *, 
   in single-sex saunas when you insist on wearing a towel in the sauna but what if i 'm gay and i 'm hiding my enthusiasm ? 
  ** do n't fucking tell me what to do bitch **, 
  i feel like a european when i think about how i hold the freedom to live and work and visit any place in europe i want without a visa ; it 's as if the whole continent sorta just says `` welcome '' ya know ? 
  plus i feel like our countries have a lot of common history intertwined , our economies are all very dependant on each other 's and generally we exchange so much culture itself as we all learned much about each other 's philosophers and arts , etc. . . 
  languages themselves seem to often intertwine and the fact that even with tonnes of different languages we still all can communicate and learn each other 's languages is still a very big part of it for me , specially because the fact that we 're all different and thus experience that `` i speak a * foreign * language '' whenver we travel around kinda makes me feel like we 're all in the same basket and it 's best if we get along , plus i find knowing foreign languages super enjoyable since they always provide not only perspective on those peoples , but also sometimes a good laugh ( like how german has funny cute long words like sehensw\u00fcrdichkeit ) plus , i feel like i 'm not as welcome like this outside of europe , so for me europe in general feels like home , and that 's what makes me feel like a european, 
  what counts as white ? 
  because i was born and raised in europe , to a european family , but it 's sunny as fuck where i was raised so we all are the same color as north africans ( we look the exact same , but have straighter hair ) not to mention , what about all the asian and black europeans that have lived here centuries ago and just integrated ? 
  europe is not really about race , it 's about morals , values , and culture . 
  ah yes , the eu ^ tm seal of approval, 
  ... you have the only football fans i know of that have their own fans accurate , +1, 
  i am portuguese , so it 's not really weird at all , i just started using belgian words and pronounciation to sorta fool everyone . 
  yeah i 'm already lucky , a friend of mine from mali actually even gave up and went back because of the extremely dysfunctional nature of it i think the education system is good in my case , because i already spoke spanish and so i got to learn german and italian , plus i was in the oib programme so i did n't have nor the extremely basic english classes nor the horridly biased and dysfunctional history classes . 
  also i moved away because i did n't like the actual higher education system at all , it 's broken as all hell , but the basic up to high school education i thought was pretty good in my experience ; better than in portugal, 
  original irish cunt ^ tm what 's the difference ? 
  i absolutely hate how accurate this is ... 
  when i lived there , i needed healthcare , provided by the carte vitale , to get it i need to apply and ... 
  i applied for the carte vitale , waited for months , contacted them and they told me to wait double the time , contacted a gain , the application took too long to process and thus has been nullified , so i applied for the carte vitale again , same bullshit story , they tell me to get a rendez vous ( which you have to book with an entirely separate contact ) and they tell me `` no , you can only book it when you actually have a * reason * to book it , not when you are waiting '' so i lived in france for half a decade without a carte vitale because i was stuck in a waiting loophole . 
  i lived a long damn time in france , and i absolutely loved that country , but there are a few reasons why i moved . 
  namely just the fact of how easy it is to just change your social ranks based on what i consider entire bullshit . 
  for my first years there i was treated like shite just because i had a more audible accent and i lived in a poorer neighborhood , even the police would n't take me seriously ... then as soon as i start sounding belgian rather than portuguese in my accent , i start noticing a very big difference in the way i 'm treated , and the same applies for when i moved to a better neighborhood ( literally next door ) . 
  administration is chaos , i lived there for 5 years , always followed the law , never had even the slightest hint of complications anywhere else , but 5 years and no carte vitale because i got stuck in a bureaucratic loophole where i make my application , they take so long to respond that it actually `` resets '' ... 
  this shit . 
  for half a decade . 
  i really * am * glad , however , that france is not only a beautiful country , but your education ( for my standards ) is still very good if you 're willing to put in the work , which i think it 's very important and i felt like i was being made responsible and accountable for my own success . 
  plus , it 's thanks to france 's schooling system that i learned foreign languages and that i got where i am today , plus it also taught me to be more accepting of differences among others . 
  for me , even if i 'm not german , opposing german reunification was a * big * no-no , not to mention that falklands case ... thatcher merely gave uk leadership a distasteful image for a while , and i believe she 's percieved as still that image . 
  she affected external politics of some countries , even more than i 'm mentioning here , but even countries that were n't affected can highly dislike her ( just like europeans tend to dislike trump ), 
  my parents stopped caring somewhere between 14 and 16 ; however they always apologise when they curse in front of me ( i 'm not sure why , they did that when i was a kid as well ) whereas i very rarely curse on their presence ( habit i guess ), 
  my personal stereotypes of us states are as follows : ** texas ** : that * one * accent , loads of trucks and guns everywhere , bigger * is * better for them , may or may not be overly religious at times , although very friendly and warm ** new york ** : everyone is dead inside , absolutely no compassion , but still quite open , super self centred , believe nyc is by far the best city in the world ** florida ** : crazy people , basically the australia of us states , old people retirement home extravaganza , oranges ? 
  ** california ** : sexy people , rich and high tech , complains about traffic all the time , built on steep bloody terrain ** alaska ** : frozen tiny communities , sarah palin like , smiling but secretly hates you ** hawaii ** : * very * sexy people , basically a huge resort for holidays even though the native inhabitants seem to dislike the whole thing , * horrible pizzas * , very weird but fun markets ** new england ** : official portuguese occupied territory ** michigan ** : it 's a goddamn glove , it 's not canada , everything there seems quite dull except for detroit ( oh god ) ** wisconsin ** : sole state to know the meaning for the word `` cheese '' ** washington ** : very nice place but full of overly offended crybaby hipsters , super cool capital though ** alabama ** : civil war storage bin for confederation ... ists ? 
  ** mississippi ** : the one state that always is the worst at everything , ever ** washington dc ** : awesome . 
  epic . 
  city . 
  people are usually very smart , everyone 's super important somehow , basically living in a crime/politics tv series and be surrounded by the sexiest characters . 
  ** louisiana ** : used to be french and fancy , did n't come with a receipt ** rest of the states ** : irrelevant and/or uncharted, 
  in portugal there 's really nothing of the sort aside from the occasional '' * man * those americans have huge portions/are dumb '' but mostly americans and america are seen in good light ( but we mercilessly do and will keep on joking about trump ) . 
  some older people seem a bit more resentful of it as not only do they tend to associate the us with how they actually * supported * salazar in portugal , but some of them sorta are a bit soviet-y when it comes to politics ( though they are n't really communists , and i think they might hate russia even more ), 
  ** loud pitched scream **, 
  in france and portugal i used to pay nearly exclusively by cash , because that 's what i had at hand and it was quick enough to pass through ( no rush ) . 
  but eversince i moved into the netherlands , where paying with a debit card is incredibly fast and easy ( and also super easy and fast to * get * one ) i really ca n't see how i ever went back !, 
  i have an app on my phone that lets me know exactly how much money i have , and honestly i feel safer carrying around a card than actual money ; the sole disadvantage is that i do n't carry any coins with me , making febo 's machines inoperable ... 
  fear not , they are very cheap ( and plentiful ) last time i was in berlin . 
  i hate how petty this is but ... keep in mind ... [ ** this has been going on for centuries now ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ), 
  i am portuguese , and i 've lived abroad ( multiple places ) since 2011 . 
  different people think i 'm different things , but never portuguese for whatever reason ... parisians thought i was russian/ukrainian/general eastern european berliners thought i was croat/bosnian/serbian / spanish ( ** triggered ** ) taiwanese people thought i was spanish ( ** triggered ** ) / french/belgian/italian australians thought i was english/irish / * a goddamn kiwi * and last but not least , dutch people thing i 'm spanish ( ** so fucking triggered ** ) or italian, 
  in portuguese we have gaita ... which is slang for dick , but can also be a bagpipe ( sorry scotland ! ), 
  i 'm an expat living in the netherlands , and yes , dutch people speak very good english in very high numbers ; but the truth is : you 'll only be an outsider unable to integrate that well because * you have n't learned the language * you 'll naturally be far more isolated and generally regarded as an outsider no matter what you do unless you speak dutch ( not even perfectly , just well enough to have a nice conversation and keep up with what 's happening around you ) . 
  french : every time i address 2 of my friends or my mom portuguese : every time i address my parents spanish : every time someone speaks to me in spanish/needs help with spanish ( pretty rare ) english : every time i address a professor or my friends , also mainly online dutch : every time at a store/someone i do n't know/shits n giggles german : every time i just feel like it and a german friend is nearby ( quite rare ) russian : private use only , still learning, 
   krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e how many accents are ** too many ** accents in czech ? 
  something ... * sexy *, 
  oooh , yeah , that makes sense . 
  sorry to hear about the dude who broke in though, 
  i think that the eu , although flawed right now , is a more viable way to achieve a better more integrated europe than * literally dividing us all over again * monarchs are nothing but symbols , you still think they mess with any democratic process ? 
  jesus by those standards then nothing in the commonwealth is democratic , nor is the netherlands , spain , belgium , the netherlands , sweden , denmark ... do i even need to keep going ? 
  where did i say an islamic state is bad ? 
  it all depends on how it 's formed , in a christian state where women are forced to cover up and non-christians are discriminated against * yes that 's bad bad * and if an islamic state does that * yes it 's still bad bad * . 
  the church in my country is extremely important culturally , to dissassociate them entirely would be a huge disconnect and even an offense to our culture , we want it there yet we respect muslims , jews , atheists etc. . . who disagree with it , but we keep it present because ** it 's an extremely highpoint of culture **, 
  was there no heating in the house ?
