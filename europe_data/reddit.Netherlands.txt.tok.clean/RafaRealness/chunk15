  the second option is an fta , which is based on * free trade * and thus the uk is free * not * to follow eu regulations should it choose to produce for itself ( your products , your regulations , you only would need to follow eu regulations and standards if when sell to us ) and you would not need to follow the 4 freedoms . 
  the problem with this option is that london happens to be a financial powerhouse and would lose passporting rights in the eu , which happens to be one of the biggest markets on earth ( something that the uk can never replace ) and it happens to be a * huge * moneymaker for the uk . 
  this also can mean heightened prices for eu products in the uk since the uk can then institute different regulations and thus it * could * cost more since they would need basically their own production for the british market , vice versa for british exports outgoing towards the eu . 
  this also means that no uk citizen will be an eez citizen and thus will be excluded from , for example , study opportunities in the eez the same way american or chinese citizens are ( paying full fees for example , in my university it 's a 400 % increase on fees for example , on other countries it is even more ) . 
  finally , the uk can also go full-out and only trade with the eu without a deal at all . 
  this basically means you 'd face the same difficulties as you would with an fta agreement , but now also you would need to deal with tariffs which would make british products less attractive due to their more expensive nature in the eu , and vice versa in the uk ( and if they are products the uk does not produce itself , then british consumers will have no choice but pay up ) . 
  associate membership and advisory roles do not bode well at all with the current framework in the least , for advisory bodies there are already systems in base that all revolve around full membership , and as for associate membership , well again this poses a problem on what exact obligations are to be met and what exact powers the uk has over the eu . 
  basically this proposal is incompatible with the current framework of operation of the eu , and with the long-term effects and evolution of the project , it can prove to be far more of a deterring nature than a mutually beneficial one since there is no point to being the eu if you can be outside of it and yet still get the benefits you want . 
  it 's not really `` we 'll see '' because that would go against treaties that explicitly explain the functioning of the european union . 
  we 'd need * years if not decades * to rewrite a system where a non-member can have a say on decisions that will affect members , but also have the efta that does not get a say . 
  not to mention the whole contradictive nature of a system where some non-members have a say yet others do not . 
  take this from someone who actually * studied * the legal proceedings and exact flexibility of the eu , and when you have a rudimentary understanding of its proceedings , you can * very easily * see why a non-member can not possibly ever get a say due to the infrastructure set in place , and that alternate infrastructures would be far less efficient and/or unpopular past the breaking point . 
  why do you think the eu would ever accept the uk to keep having a say in a union it is leaving ? 
  you are inside or out , there is no inbetween . 
  no say without membership . 
  you left you deal with it . 
  the uk already paid its fair share even with * rebate deals * . 
  norway pays in to be part of the common market , follows eu regulations to the letter , and also accepts all 4 freedoms . 
  they do not get a say * but * have control over certain key areas that are important for them ( such as fishing regulations ) and pay a reduced fee . 
  if the uk wants to have a say in the european union , then the uk needs to be * a part * of the european union . 
  america is in a league of its own , we ca n't compete with this level of amazing proficiency of r/nottheonion, 
  matters . 
  for me the fact that not only the american voters were offered trump and hillary as a choice speaks volumes as to how this binary system is horridly broken . 
  they were given two very bad choices in essence , and the worst possible choice won without even the popular vote . 
  this is a very broken and unfair system that serves them horridly wrong in my opinion . 
  after my friend spelled `` the rice of communism '' in her essay i no longer take that word without a giggle . 
  to be fair , trump did n't get the popular vote , it 's just that the college system is utter bullshit , and so is first past the post since it divides politics into one binary choice and before you know it you 're a proud citizen under the cheeto f\u00fchrer . 
  do n't be jealous we have our own language , ** austria **, 
   you are behind with the luxembourg compromise . 
  in the wikipedia article is states that since 1983 , it was n't that relevant anymore . 
  also , on one of the eu websites , it says that qmv is used in 80 % of the votes about secondary legislation . 
  well , in research publications about the functioning of the eu itself like europe recast , you see that qmv is used in a * tonne * of cases where there was no veto , and that the luxembourg compromise is * still * in effect but progressively it englobes less and less fields and magnitudes of decision-making at the core of the eu 's policy . 
  in 1983 there was a very big step that shook the compromise heavily away from being applied to most measures it previously was being applied to , but that is not to say that it has been dismantled at all , its value is merely segregated for other decisions . 
  it basically is a slow move-away movement from the luxembourg compromise that still lingers on today , and for the bigger decisions ( such as the expansion of the eu , for example ) then all countries * must * imperatively accept and approve of the decision before it * ever * sees the light of day . 
   the reason i only mention directives is that regulations are directly applicable and individually enforceable , while directives are not . 
  so your government does not always need to agree with eu secondary legislation in order for it to influence individuals . 
  that is true , sorry i actually use the wrong word there , i meant actual defined regulation ( such as legal limits on the amount of sodium in food , which is n't variable from country to country ) . 
   i 'm very pro-eu , and of course the eu is not an `` oppressive semi-dictatorial union full of unelected bureaucrats '' , but you can definitely argue that there is some kind of democratic deficit , especially because only the comission has legislative initiative . 
  there are ways to request the comission to create legislation , but these are not binding . 
  i fully agree , and i believe that our system definitely needs to be rethought , reworked , and reformed into something more directly accessible for the average european citizen , regardless of member state . 
  one of the criticisms i have about it is that i , as a resident of the netherlands , can not vote for parties in the european parliament that only count on , let 's say , belgian votes ; for me these parties in parliament need to be organised more properly and form a more pan-european spectre of opinion . 
  plus i fully agree with what you said about the commission , that it is the sole entity with legislative initiative , however i also believe that the eu , as a project , is too young and still too early to push for a more federalized system where the commission is more at the orders of the peoples of europe and less of the agenda by the european council or by the requests of whoever else . 
  i believe that we should reform the system regarding the parliament in order to provide a better representation of the * european citizens * ( rather than x seats of germany , y seats of france , etc. . . ) but changing the commission system would probably overstep it . 
   compared to that , most states , where parliament has the possibility of putting forward legislative proposals , are much more directly democratic . 
  i agree , but we need to remind ourselves that the eu is not a state , and that federalization and treating the eu as an actual federal state ( a `` united states of europe '' if you will ) would be a step too far especially with growing concerns over the union itself . 
  my personal priorities would be to harmonise and fix the deficits we have with our current system , such as integration of romania and bulgaria into the schengen zone , as well as better protection of the eu 's external borders not only in the mediterranean , but also with russia , belarus , ukraine , moldova , and turkey . 
  ( european ) portuguese , spanish , english , french , and italian . 
  i am currently learning dutch and russian . 
  just 5 right now , learning 2 more though !, 
  not really , google translate is not even remotely full proof and there is * no * way you can translate , for example , poetry and maintain ** exactly ** the same meaning . 
  plus , there are some concepts that are plainly * not * translatable , like `` saudade '' or `` hygge '' or `` gezellig '' that you can find some equivalence or some explanation but no matter what you do it is never exact enough . 
   you should be honest about the veto power . 
  most decisions in the council of ministers are made with qualified majority voting in which individual countries do not have veto power . 
  not since the luxembourg compromise after the empty chair crisis that france instigated . 
  ever since that event all member states have veto under the condition that they do not leave until they are on board with whatever is arranged . 
  qualified majority voting is used in any case where this does not apply , which seems to fully be growing in number ( meaning that qmv becomes the sole system used in a growing number of topics , however due to the vague and loose way the treaties were written , sometimes it is unclear which ones count and which ones do not ) . 
   also the principle of the commissionners is not that they represent a nation , they are the same as ministers of countries . 
  originally they wanted to reduce the number of commissionners to something like 15 to reduce the bureaucracy problem ( some commissionners portefeuilles make absolutely no sense now ) , but that was politically not viable . 
  that is true , however they are n't really like the ministers since they do not defend national interest ( as you said , they do not represent a nation ) and i fully agree that we have too many commissioners and need to rethink not only their number and need , but also their appointment methodology . 
  while we 're talking about the commission , and this is unrelated , i 'd like for him to keep in mind that the parliament , who is directly elected , can fully dissolve the commission should there be a need for such a thing ( they did it in the past and can still do it again ) . 
  my point was to show that there is * no * part of the eu that is really the eu itself , it is all our national governments ' appointees or directly elected members of the european parliament . 
   if you do not implement eu directives ( regulations are automatically turned into national law ) , you will get sanctioned by the commission sooner or later . 
  that is the case for * directives * however as you will find in many approved eu legislation , some of these are mostly goals , like ensuring that potable water levels are met and maintained but the methodology is left to the member states , and these are more complex to sanction . 
  furthermore , these sanctions tend to work poorly right now as poland , even as the eu 's biggest receiver of funds , has * by far * the highest cases among member states of conviction of these events , and yet not much has changed . 
  i thought i was really good with languages ... but jesus now i feel like a damn n00b , like a drag queen that just got her wig snatched . 
  ** challenge accepted **, 
   migrants quotas are not done , it 's not even a month since austrian chancellor demanded `` less money '' from eu funds for countries which oppose the migrant quota . 
  the austrian chancellor is * not * the eu though , and has he been successful with his proposal ? 
  plus , he mainly wanted to punish those who accepted and signed the relevant deals regarding the migrant quota system , but then shat on it and turned their backs in order to gain political leverage at home , which is * precisely * what happened and keeps happening : countries reel in benefits of being members of the eu without properly implementing eu decisions they agree with , thus causing unneeded havoc . 
  also , according to you these cohesion funds are useless and propagate corruption so according to your own arguments is n't it a * good * thing ? 
   so this is how `` veto '' in the eu works in reality , blackmailing and threatening those who oppose . 
  nobody is threatening in the eu though , it was * austria 's chancellor * who * proposed * a resolution that not even the * commission * drafted and could not possibly pass neither the council of ministers nor the parliament ** because you can veto that resolution ** . 
   when it comes to the east-west competition i have no problem with it unless western european countries exporting the same products in the same quality . 
  yeah , and ** guess what the eu has been constantly putting on blast certain companies for ? 
  ** these types of practice , which are illegal according to eu law and are on their way to be sanctioned heavily ...  i personally think that the eu will not last very long , more ( especially younger generation ) people started to see that the eu is equal on paper only . 
  you can personally think whatever you want , but the truth is that your rights are identical in paper and in practice . 
  my romanian and polish friends came to the netherlands the same exact way i did and did n't face any obstacles except for currency exchange ( because i 'm from a country in the eurozone ) . 
   we should go our own way western europe can keep its market for westerners and we can keep our own with our own production for easterners . 
  i see no problem in it and many people would welcome it . 
  you would have higher unemployment rates as western companies that decided to produce in the east due to the competitive prices for employment there would need to pull out since they no longer would be able to sell in the west , and the eastern industries would also need to downsize in order to sell to a far smaller marketshare than previously . 
  this will generate a loss of jobs but also in revenue for the government in the form of taxes . 
  plus , what would you like to say to all of those eastern europeans whom have taken the initiative to leave eastern europe and find a new home in the west ? 
  or all the westerns that moved to eastern europe ? 
  that because * you personally feel like * this myth of an argument is far more important than their rights ? 
   they already took action against dutch cows yep , we 've been close to anarchy ever since . ^ / s, 
   we already saw how powerful our veto is after they have pushed through the migrant quotas which essentially destroyed our mutual trust . 
  that resolution is already done , they do n't really keep it up anymore * because * of disagreements over it . 
  so again , it really is n't up to the eu to dictate anything , it 's up to member states to accept or decline any propositions . 
  not to mention , everybody accepted it in the eu institutions , the sole difference is that some went back to their countries and used it to gain political leverage at home by scapegoating the eu ( like britain 's been doing for years on end ) . 
   for the eu eastern european countries really are just a waste bin where second class western products are exported in a huge scale , only recently after intensive pressure and publicization of this problem the eu started at least talking about it . 
  what exactly would you expect when eastern european countries entered the common market ? 
  that you 'd have to face no competition from the west in terms of economy ? 
  furthermore , the east gets tonnes of funds in order to be invested in infrastructure and these are paid * by the west * and eastern industries still sell a * lot * to the west , resulting in more employment and revenue . 
   the eastern europeans are taken as an second lass citizens and despised in the western part of the eu , i have no problem with this but i do n't understand why are they covering it , we can make eastern and western eu and all problems will be solved . 
  eastern europeans in the eu have the same exact rights as western europeans in the eu though , there is literally no distinction between the two . 
  just like us you have freedom of movement and the right to work and live wherever you wish in the eez . 
  furthermore , dividing the common market into two would mainly put the eastern part out of reach again , and remind yourself that eastern european industries benefit * heavily * from the western market since they can sell to a far bigger consumer base , and to lose it would mean a loss of industrial might for the east , which is something that would benefit nobody . 
   cohesion funds are just a silly joke average citizens have only limited or absolutely no benefit from these funds it only propelled corruption in poorer countries , usually these funds do n't make more than 1 % of the gdp in net calculation . 
  it 's natural that they are small since they are in nature subsidiary and the country must agree to the investments made in certain key areas . 
  as for only propelling corruption , well the eu is not in charge in the least of national governments and needs to treat all of them equally in its inner workings , so again , if you believe this to be an issue , this is a * national * one and not really an * eu * issue .
