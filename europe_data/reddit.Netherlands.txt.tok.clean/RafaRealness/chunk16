  yup !, 
  you 'd be surprised actually . 
  remind yourself that * every * member state of the eu still holds the power of veto ( including even the teeny tiniest ones like malta or cyprus ) via the council of ministers , and that * nothing * gets passed without approval by the council of ministers . 
  so small and/or poor states * do * get a pretty hefty say just like germany or france . 
  same goes for the commission , all member states have the same exact representation : one appointed commissionner per state . 
  where this say diverges is the european parliament , where the parliament 's seats are distributed by states based on * population * and they are elected by european citizens themselves . 
  but keep in mind that this has constantly demonstrated that germany is getting less seats per capita than the smaller states due to efforts to include everyone without having far too many seats to ever get anything done . 
  the eu does n't really have `` unelected bureaucrats '' , the commissioners are appointed by * your * country 's government ( which you elect ) and the council of ministers are * your * country 's ministers ( literally your own government here ) and the european parliament is even * directly * elected . 
  not to mention that if the eu really wanted poorer eu member states to be merely sweatshops , then there would be no cohesion funds that are a * really * big part of the eu budget itself , and you still are free to produce whatever you want with no mandate on what 's what as long as you comply with the regulations of the common market * that your government always needs to agree to in order for them to pass * . 
  at first i read `` airport '' for some reason , then looked at the picture and thought : ** that better not be the landing strip i swear to all that is blue ** but then i reread the title . 
  holy crap apparently it * is * russian . 
  it 's called \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442 \u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044c\u0435 which despite its name it has nothing to do with olives ( in english it 's called olivier salad ), 
  i will genuinely ask my russian teacher if they have this in russia , and what it 's called . 
  i said none of those things though . 
  what i said is that we need to deal with the ones that , no matter how hard we collectively try will get through borders illegally . 
  if north koreans can so can them . 
  also :  a brussels politician you know the eu does n't really have its own politicians right ? 
  they are all assigned by the member states ( including poland ) or * voted in * bu the european elections . 
   how the fuck does schengen visa free travel even fucking work it is n't visa free though , you need a visa ( which are stricter to get than , for example , the united kingdom ) to get into schengen . 
  freedom of movement is * only * for people within the eu , not for those outside of it . 
   the fall of the eu will be the best outcome from merkels children firstly , now you 're reminding me of nazi slogans , and secondly how is the destruction of an organization that has made europe an economic powerhouse going to help * any * of us ? 
  remind yourself how bleak and dodgy trade was in the years way before we had anything like that , and how dominated less economically powerful countries were ( like poland ) . 
  * high pitched scream * do n't mention ... you know ... that ... that place ... o_o, 
  deal !, 
  i did n't say `` let 's get rid of border protection '' i said that even if we get tougher protection , they are still going to find ways to cross over . 
  the sole border i can think of in the world that is n't like that is the dmz in korea , and i 'd very would rather not have that option . 
  furthermore , keep in mind that a good chunk of the problem is illegal migrants coming by sea or getting into ceuta and mallorca , which are all really hard places to coordinate and defend . 
  but ... 
  i do n't drink !, 
  i mean i guess i can drink a glass or two for the celebration of it . 
  my place or yours ? 
  throw in some red pesto and you 've got a deal !, 
  i absolutely * love * that , especially with boiled eggs ( my favorite part ) , i usually put tuna with them . 
  for me , i call [ this thing ] ( http://honestcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/screen-shot-2013-12-10-at-12.41.37-pm.png ) russian salad . 
  i had some cereals , tomorrow i 'm preparing to make some russian salad !, 
  what 's noodle salad ? 
  what 's a `` belgium '' ? 
  ... well i mean , starbucks and ugg boots ... 
  right back at ya , now what do you say we all have dinner one of these days eh ? 
  no seriously i 'm hungry . 
  i do n't like it either and i still defend that we need to spread them out and not allow them to pick and choose which countries they want asylum in , but i do n't think that not allowing them to come will ever stop them . 
  technically they * already * ca n't come but it 's not like their migration patterns follow the law is it?n, 
  not a stretch and according to official memos it 's a fact that a * lot * of inspiration was taken from the benelux actually . 
  well , the concept of europe most likely will , it survived countless reiterations of its `` end '' over and over again . 
  obviously it wo n't be the one you knew , but * nothing * will be the one you know , just compare the world from today with 1917, 
  and how do you propose we do that ? 
  people got over the berlin wall , and escaped the ussr into finland , and that 's just a few examples . 
  no matter how hard you protect your borders , nothing is full-proof, 
  that 's how good [ super glue 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velvguwxntg ) is . 
  it 's staring at me too , * and i 'm staring right back *, 
  not as easy . 
  the process of deportation takes * ages * to get through and can be very expensive . 
  paying them to leave voluntarily can be far faster , and also cheaper than going through the process . 
  well , we are all ( in the world scale ) very tiny countries , and economically we rely ** heavily ** on the common market in order to make our lives possible the way ( and at the price ) they are . 
  historically , this economic cooperation has brought down age-old rivalries and tensions and helped peace instate itself into the continent ( france vs germany , portugal vs spain , etc. . . ) . 
  so internally we tend to rely a lot on the common market . 
  but obviously a common market by itself is not at all perfect . 
  the common market , should it be instead a free-trade zone , would mean total domination by the strongest countries over the smallest ones . 
  a great example of this is the euro itself . 
  before the euro , west germany already was dominating nearly all other currencies within the european community due to the fact that west germany was * very * economically strong . 
  the deutschmark 's fluctuations somewhat forced the dutch guilders to follow along to the * hour * . 
  so then 1989 happened and reunification talks started . 
  this meant that the bundesrepublik deutschland , taking in the new bundesl\u00e4nden from the deutsche demokratische republik would lead up to an even bigger and more powerful german economy . 
  germany basically was getting far too big for the european framework in those days , economically mainly . 
  the solution to at least solve the currency question was to make germany utilize a system where fluctuations of all currencies would be pegged to each other essentially ( which did not work , it was called the snake in the tunnel , but due to other circumstances it crashed and burned ) . 
  the european monetary union , which later generated our euro , was the solution to this : * one * currency that * all * eurozone states must share and agree on its usage , one common bank for all of eurozone countries . 
  so we see that we need integration is needed for this common market of ours to work and be prosperous for * all * of us , but also to prevent bigger states from dominating european economies . 
  on another note , this union also allows the member states to striker more favorable deals with the outside world and gives them more leverage as they are part of a far bigger market with an extreme attraction ** however ** keep in mind that everything i said here is fully open to debate , and although i try to be objective about this and defend these arguments , other people can fully disagree with them . 
   deportate ** hahahhaha **, 
  makes sense !, 
  how hard is it to change from the flemish-speaking system onto the french-speaking system and vice versa ? 
  does one have advantages over the other ? 
  sorry i bombard you with questions , but belgium 's pretty fascinating to me when it comes to how the different communities organize themselves . 
   i 've never been very into tom of finlands drawings . 
  agreed , though for me it 's mainly that i 'm not into super duper manly stuff with only macho dudes . 
  sure we all like a bit of masc4masc but i mean ... a dude that is that great balance of happily feminine but also still not too far from the traditional man is * the * guy i wan na let in my pants . 
   germany heads towards communism and marxism no , 1989 called , you * may * really wan na pick up the phone . 
  * i 'm versatile and flexible ~ i 'm whatever you wish *, 
  ... still correct though . 
  two apples are still apples in english . 
  also , it 's 3 billion . 
  ball hard son . 
  ball hard . 
  it includes the country whose name is ireland , and its borders . 
  northern ireland is not a part of ireland and is not a country ( it 's part of the united kingdom ) . 
  the joke is that ireland does n't really produce wine , so their wine regions are null . 
  see the other threads about countries that actually produce wine . 
  but would n't vrt be in dutch ? 
  i mean , it 's still pretty easy in general to get info about belgian affairs in general because the internet is a wonderful thing at least . 
  hard to do from the * outside * of the eu ya know ? 
  this really sounds like wilders 2 , another populist with generalized and unusable ideas that do n't even really go together to begin with . 
  what about brussels ? 
  i heard that it mainly speaks french and it does not belong to neither wallonia nor flanders . 
  do the names of the networks change ? 
  like , is de standaard called le standard and de morgen called le matin ? 
  ( funny thing is that the dutch speakers have de morgen , and the french have le soir , * because together they make the whole day and that is adorable * ), 
  ** g\u00d6tterfunken reaches level 60 , rejoice at once for the freude of it all **, 
  thanks !, 
  we are enjoying our decline on prices , decline on unemployment , decline on poverty ... 
  feels good man .
