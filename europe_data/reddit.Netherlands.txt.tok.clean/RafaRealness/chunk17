  general question for belgians about news : are your news medias often bi ( tri ? ), 
  lingual for the french and flemish ( and german ) speakers ? 
  if so , do they have different names for both communities ? 
   what are you some kind of expert ** duh expuuuhts **, 
  nice design !, 
  agreed , i am pretty astonished at how bad it 's gotten with fishing , maybe staff was out fishing . 
  * fear us for this is the gay agenda at its work * first conchita , ** now moomin ** til : those drawings are from tom of finland . 
  / thread i swear this guy is a meme . 
  well , you 'd have quite a say when it comes to the commission and the council because in those every member state is equal regardless of anything really . 
  the part where norway would not really gain as much as , say , sweden , is the parliament where populations are represented proportionally . 
  but i agree that fishing is important to norway , and since norway would rather keep that to themselves , then the efta is the best option . 
  plus , you pay less contributions if you are in the efta which is an advantage as well . 
  i said it once and i 'll say it again : and guess what 15-16 years old do . 
  they go to school . 
   as long as they do n't break the law which , as it 's been statistically proven , they tend to do . 
   it 's called democracy that is n't democracy ... technically you can do the same under a dictatorship as well since you can do whatever you want _ within the law _ . 
  what you mean is equality , which is considered by many a basic european value . 
  i agree with you , however while talking about the roma , whom unfortunately have a lot of their individuals who break romanian law , thus creating tensions and thus more divides between romas and romanians . 
  and guess what 15-16 years old do . 
  they go to school . 
  it looks ** beautiful ** . 
  good on you croatia !, 
  well , the song was really cool , i liked it , though i agree it was * way * beyond the mark on political . 
  i am still surprised this was allowed at all . 
  to be fully fair , it mainly is . 
  yes , dutch leadership made some mistakes here and there , but let 's be real every single leadership has done so as well . 
  i agree with a lot of dijsselbloem 's stances and especially on his stance against overspending , however i find his comments distasteful about my country . 
  that being said , it was * one * comment and i believe this is being blown out of proportion , it is counter-productive , and although i think that there should be some address to the issue by the states , i disagree with the proportions it took . 
   i have seen very little evidence to suggest that the south of europe is financially more capable than the north . 
  quite the opposite really . 
  yet we are a tax haven , so it 's not like the north is faring that much better ... 
  there is no north or south blame here , what we really need is someone capable of resolute decisions and harmonisation of economic measures * both * in the north and the south without making distasteful comments of the sort . 
  we need a good president of the eurogroup * regardless * of nationality . 
   its not bs insinuating that the crisis on the southern countries is resumed to rude comments as an * official * is entire bullshit . 
  the crisis has faced far more nuances than that , most of which is not to attribute nor to the north nor the south but the lack of cooperative and syncing measures taken to key economic decisions . 
   that is not considered particularly toxic here . 
  we can say literally anything as long as it is not a swear word . 
  and often those too ( ` godverdomme kankermongool je moet je bek houden ' is what we consider offensive . 
  no dont translate that ) . 
  because you are not an official , or do you think that saying `` the pvda spent their time doing nothing since last elections '' as * mark rutte * is perfectly fine ? 
  this is supposed to be a representative of all of the eurozone 's best interests and cooperative measures and yet he makes rude comments that are counterproductive . 
   to spend everything on women and wine is an expression in english i believe . 
   dijsselbloem is not condidered to be a firebrand . 
  he is just a former finance minister who is hard on overspending . 
  people here have not forgotten here the issues with iceland and greece and others . 
  the $ had almost gone the way of the dodo . 
  i think he is right too . 
  the reaction unfortunately shows how right . 
  the eurozone can not survive if overspending is tolerated . 
  all hail jeroen !, 
  nobody disagrees that there must be a cut on overspending , however it is not by pissing off half the eurozone that you will achieve anything at all , it 'll create a more hostile narrative in countries that have been accused of such allegations and give anti-european even more fuel ( luckily they are very small in portugal and spain ) . 
   if europe ditches him , i hope he comes back . 
  the netherlands needs left wing leaders not afraid of pissing wilders off . 
  i 'm pretty sure nobody is scared of pissing wilders off , right winged or left winged . 
  ** p r e a c h **, 
  the head of the eurogroup , dijsselbloem , said some pretty nasty comments that people interpreted as being about the south . 
  stuff along the lines that the south `` spent all their money on women and booze '' , which is quite problematic as you can imagine . 
  he said that this was due to `` dutch bluntness '' ( which i personally call bullshit , because i * am * from the south and the dutch * are * very direct but they are n't toxic and childish with criticism ) which somewhat means that he * believes * what he said . 
  thus there is beef between the southern european states and him because of these comments . 
  it is interesting to note that he was put in power in a time where the netherlands had a * huge * portion of its seats in parliament represented by the pvda ( partij van de arbeit , labour party , very eurosceptic claims often ) which has lost * a massive * support base ( being reduced from 24.8 % with 38 seats to 5.7 % with 9 seats ) so some believe he stopped caring since he might be on his way out . 
  personally , i agree that the eurozone states * need * to be on the same page and on the address of issues together , but there was absolutely no need to start calling other states such things , and in fact that is merely counterproductive . 
   i 'm assuming sangre means red in portuguese , i could n't think of any other portuguese alcoholic beverages . 
  ... this is trump-levels of stupidity i swear . 
  this is a bachelor 's and when it comes to worldwide context there 's a * lot * that is provided but the spotlight always centres itself on europe . 
  the outer world is provided mainly not only for contrast and comparison ( especially for more political and structural analysis ) but also for historical context . 
  if you want i can send you a link with the full description of the programme and its courses . 
  history is actually just a portion of it , we also focus on economy , politics , law and order , linguistics , societal development , institution protocol ... basically europe yesterday , today , and what * might * happen in the future !, 
  from the 2 ^ nd year onwards we are also required to take an elective course , which can be focused on history , arts , eastern europe ( it 's got its own ) , economy , politics , law ... 
  ** underrated post as hell how is this not gilded yet **, 
  as someone who studies european studies , well , europe is the blurriest term bloody ever . 
  it is often associated with the geographical continent ( that does n't even have fully 100 % defined borders to bloody begin with ) . 
  but it is also a historical concept dating back to the early days of christianity ( europa , africa , asia , they all are women 's names too and are linked to the to maps that were the first conceptual `` split '' of the 3 first continents ) . 
  then there is also the * political * europe and then you have a problem because europe is very much in 3 camps : the eu , the russian sphere , and the independent ones ( hi switzerland ! ), 
  and the same was true during the cold war we had east europe and west europe but nobody said that neither was n't europe . 
  plus , considering that the eu is a project open for all of europe , then it is a pretty natural progression from that onto calling it just `` europe '' at times in dialogues due to its connotations and actions . 
  you see , the idea of europe was very much invented and recycled over the ages and so has the conceptualisation of who is europe and who is n't , for example during the times of the ottoman empire we had the near east , which was not regarded as really europe even though nowadays we can all agree that greece is indisputably in europe for example , and again during the cold war the divide ran so deep that we both agreed that europe was ... well , europe , but divided between east and west europe and the two were not the same at all ( even though poland and czechoslovakia were pretty much europe just before ) . 
  this goes on and on and on and on ... 
  there has never been an end-all-be-all definition of `` europe '' and this one is no exception , now that the eu is a powerful and pan-european entity * can * be called europe due to the common name-calling we have for it since it covers most of the territory that is considered as indisputably `` europe '' so for the sake of efficiency and everyday thought , europe is definitely highly related to the eu . 
  tl ; dr : the word europe is incredibly debated on its actual 100 % definition of it , so obviously when there is something called `` the eu '' that includes most of the states in the continent with ties to even more , then in terms of political language it is very natural to say just `` europe '' . 
  we say `` america '' for the us and yet we know pretty well they are not at all the whole of the continent , it 's just all based on dialogue and evolution . 
  accurate in my case tbh , i like a little bit of spicy brexit-related cheeky banter . 
  the efta also includes other members who do n't though . 
  not really , you can invade a place without colonizing it and incorporating it into your empire . 
   this is obviously in response to rising anti-eu sentiment and brexit . 
  fans of the eu trying to create a ` cool ' ` in-group ' to try and delegitimise anti eu opposition . 
  it 's pathetic and anyone can see through it . 
  well , i 'm terribly sorry but this pro-eu movement is nothing new , in fact , historically it started around the 70 's . 
  the real difference is that nowadays , with new forms of media such as the internet , they are becoming more visible to anyone as well as more public and more interactive . 
  there is no real `` in group '' here , it 's just people who support the eu , just like there are people who support scottish independence , or people who support brexit . 
   i love people being proud of their nation if that 's what you mean . 
  national festivals , sports matches etc. 
  this does not at all answer my question , my question is do you find anti-eu acts ( waving flags of , for example , the fn , or `` maga '' or de pvv ) equally cringeworthy ? 
  these do not stem from national culture at all and are merely the other side of the argument of these acts . 
  again , why ? 
  this is for people who disagree with you and prefer to support the eu . 
  do you find that anti-eu acts of the same exact nature are just as cringeworthy ? 
  so did norway , they are doing fine . 
  plus , these people believe in * the eu * which is n't really a huge political entity itself . 
  staff-wise there are more people working for the municipality of amsterdam than the eu ... 
  besides , i 'm assuming you 're british , you 're on your way out so is n't this what you wanted regardless ?
