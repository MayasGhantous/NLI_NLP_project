  you 're leaving . 
  plus you have n't answered my question : what 's so bad about a pro-eu act to you ? 
  it 's just a pro-eu act ... 
  imagine if it were all union jacks , would that make it any different ? 
  the eu has brought a * lot * of rights and improvements to the continent , not only in terms of trade and travel , but also in terms of political stability and support . 
  i love the eu myself ( though i still think it could be better than it is ) and the reasons to like the eu vary to great extent from people to people . 
  for me , personally , i 'm grateful for the eu 's help to my country once we revolted against our former dictatorship , as well as the opportunities it has granted me to study abroad and be treated with equality in france and the netherlands ; plus i 'm also grateful for the rights that i have as an eu citizen that other people in the world do not ( both domestically and abroad ) . 
  * do keep in mind though * that this is subjective , and there are people who absolutely hate the eu beyond anything else . 
  it 's a debatable topic . 
  more like the dutch and finnish government vetoing romanian and bulgarian ascension into schengen over fears of crime and corruption . 
  the eu is entirely on the hands of the national governments , if one vetoes anything then that 's that ... 
  the eu itself does n't really have a say or opinions . 
  the timing she has always defended for scotland 's referendum is whenever the brexit terms are finally clear , but before scotland is fully dragged into them . 
  this allows for the scots to make an informed decision whether they would like to live in brexit uk or independently . 
   irish people must be pretty xenophobic too to have remained outside of the schengen zone in the first place ? 
  or they are rational and prefer to maintain the cta with the * one * country they actually have a border with . 
  * the plot unfolds *, 
  i 'm fairly certain that when you talk about the eu , you also talk about its antecedents that date back to about 1957 , with the ecsc , the eec , the ec , etc. . . 
  * marry a sexxy sexxy yuropean and get back in the union !, 
  * jesus christ i did not need that image in my head *, 
  well in that case ireland is the eurovision republic ^ ( * suck it sweden * ), 
  ** fuck ** so france gets to be the bic republic then ... 
  glad you came to r/europe then . 
  sorta reminds me of the great dictator where nazi germany was called * tomatia * or something . 
  which i did n't disagree with , because that is not at all what the eu is gunning for . 
  the eu is not really a government , it still remains * very * intergovernmental when it comes to the way it is managed , and its goal is mainly economic trade and prosperity for member states ( though there * are * motions to deepen the integration process to include more political factors ) . 
  economically the eu is pretty huge ( 2nd only to the us itself ) and it still holds a pretty hefty place in the world when it comes to trade and influential topics that directly affect it ( look at the external investments the eu currently makes ) . 
  but the fact is that it is * not * a military , nor a political power . 
  but it is n't a superpower since it is not at all that type of project . 
  canada , for example , * is * a state , and its economy is 10th in the world . 
  it is more of a superpower than the eu since it * does * have political says , it * does * have a capable and active military , and it generally is * not * an intergovernmentalist union . 
  that is true , however the eu itself is already the second largest economy in the world . 
  if we divide it by countries then germany , italy , and france , all eurozone members , are still in the top 10 economies with pretty good growth . 
  i 'm pro-eu but let 's be honest we have problems . 
  for me the main issues we 're facing right now are related to the eu 's external borders , fact is that eastern member states are worried about a potential russian threat whereas the west does not really care as much ; and also we have a problem with the current refugee crisis with no answer so far . 
  there are also other problems , but i believe that * right now * those are the mainly covered ones . 
  [ ** the plan now unfolds ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at8zgwexh9m ) i 'd be all up for it , australia 's sexy . 
   i have no idea what that ft article is about because it 's behind a pay wall . 
  sorry about that , here 's the paragraphs i 'm talking about :  the eurozone economy has now posted 14 consecutive quarters of growth , the unemployment rate has returned into single digits , and economic sentiment has reached its highest level in six years . 
  the numbers contrast with common depictions of the eurozone economy as stagnant , sclerotic and perennially underperforming . 
   in fact , job creation for the eurozone accelerated to a near nine-year record in january , while the rate of output growth maintained a 5 1/2 - year high . 
   despite deep concerns about italian banks and greece 's long-running financial crisis , eurozone growth in the fourth quarter of last year was estimated at 0.5 per cent , faster than the us rate . 
  for 2016 as a whole , growth in the eurozone outpaced that in the us by 1.7 per cent to 1.6 per cent . 
   analysts agree on the reasons for the relatively robust economic performance of the eurozone : the financial crisis is now nearly a decade old ; there is plenty of slack from unemployment to absorb ; and the uk 's vote to leave has not proved the shock many feared . 
  furthermore , the european central bank 's ultra-loose monetary policy is now finally working , encouraging households and companies to borrow and spend . 
  domestic demand has fuelled most of the recent growth . 
   not having the uk ( or any state , for that matter ) reduces the eu 's influence and by extention their bargaining power . 
  while yes , it may be more or less business as usual without the uk or other states , that does n't change the fact that the eu is hurt by members leaving . 
  i fully agree with what you are saying , you 're absolutely right on your claims , that is undeniable . 
  what i * do * disagree with , which was my main point on my post was that even though we * are * losing a very good member that has been with us since 1973 , the eu still is extremely important and can perform correctly within itself as well as still maintain a high position regarding negotiations not only with its neighbors ( for example belarus or bosnia and herzegovina , and in the future the uk ) but also the world . 
  i believe that , for example , when the canadian government was forced to include romanian and bulgarian visa waivers as part of the ceta instead of excluding * some * eu nationalities from it proves to what extent the eu still is a capable bargaining force . 
  keep in mind that canada already has * very * open borders to the uk ( so they did not even care at all for these demands ) as well as france ( partially supported it , but not much ) . 
  the eu can remain still very strong both economically , and in terms of international influence , but i do not at all disagree with you that the exit of any member * is * a loss . 
   no , the euro zone did not outperform the us in terms of gdp . 
  where you got this idea i do not know . 
  [ sorry , should have rephrased that differently ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/0bbc026a-ea12-11e6-967b-c88452263daf )  the uk contributes a substantial amount to the eu 's economy , and without it the eu would be considerably smaller from an economic standpoint . 
  that i agree with , it is true that the uk is a valuable member of the eu , but i disagree that the eu 's success is endangered by the uk leaving . 
  i believe it 's a shame to see them leave but it 's their choice to do so and i respect it , but it is n't because the uk is leaving that the functioning and funding of the eu will genuinely be at risk . 
  smaller economy ? 
  yes of course , a member * is * leaving , that 's undeniable , smaller fund pool ? 
  again , yes that 's true because the uk is a net contributor , but the eu , as it is mainly an economic union of member states is still going to perform with business as usual * with the exception of trade with the uk * . 
  i like his points and stances ( most of the tipe ) but * by god * his speeches need to step up their game . 
  froot \u00b2 i actually like that . 
  well i just got a bit more educated . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  i would n't really call germany a banana republic though , maybe a volkswagen republic ? 
  a home appliances republic ? 
  what else does germany produce a lot of ... oh !, 
  bic pen republic !, 
  i always wondered what he meant by `` banana republic '' , especially because i used to think that was an underwear brand . 
  i must say , i had no idea that sturgeon gave such great speeches . 
  it was very calm , it was clear , and it was not very inflammatory . 
  i love also that she addressed a bit people that may vote * against * independence and also the complete stress that these referendums bring . 
  i am genuinely in awe by her . 
  i think that they were trying to purposefully lead the numbers to seem anti-brexit but you 're right at these statistics are quite misleading and have been a bit misconducted . 
  the guardian , the independent , and the telegraph , etc. . . all have biases and whenever they mention actual concrete facts and numbers , it shows . 
  well , it 's better than how they used to visit it during the troubles at least . 
  ah yes , our national anthem . 
  it has for post-dictatorial portugal and spain , and it is the eu that has managed to diffuse franco german relationships straight after the world wars , and also instituted * what still are the highest standards * over products , services , and even public institutions . 
  i am from portugal , and trust me when i say that our future was pretty bleak ( with coup d'\u00e9tats basically every other day due to our internal struggles ) before we joined in , and escalations with spain at the time were looking even scarier . 
  the eu let us both in to give us a far better economic situation to * stop * our constant struggles , to make us both cooperate with each other ( and thus give portugal and spain the best relationship they 've had in modern history ) and also to give our governments the stability they need to maintain our democratic processes . 
  * no but okay that was actually a pretty good burn . 
  oh crap i just noticed , happy reddit birthday !, 
  i think it 's super interesting to get to know slovenia and croatia , mainly because i admit i do n't know the two countries very well ( but at least i know i can get married in ljubljana nowadays ! ), 
   not a policial union ? 
  what are you smoking my friend . 
  i just demonstrated how the eu remains still extremely an intergovernmental association rather than a political union . 
  what do you think makes the eu a political union ? 
   the amount of war around the world has reduced alot because of the us . 
  world is alot more stable than it was 100years ago . 
  if you dont see that there is no helping you , sorry . 
  bullshit , the us and the ussr engaged in extremely dangerous proxy wars as a dick measuring contest and the us even continued it * outside * a cold war context . 
  how many lives were lost worldwide because of american meddling ? 
  and how many will be in the future ? 
  the us is absolutely no saint , it is merely on europe 's side * now * and even then it constantly threatens our stability , for example with their extremely toxic 2008 fiscal actions that spread mainly into the mediterranean . 
  peace in the eu is thanks to the eu , and i agree that the us * did * help the eu get instituted ( who the hell funded its start to begin with , and forced britain to give way to its creation ? ), 
  but the fact of the matter is that the us is also to blame for * much * of the bloodshed that the world has faced before , during , and after the cold war . 
  if you ask the us , pizza is already a veggie !, 
  how similar is slovenian and croatian/serbo-croat ( whatever you want to call it i just do n't want to offend anyone ) . 
   and it was n't a political union back than , so people did n't mind .
