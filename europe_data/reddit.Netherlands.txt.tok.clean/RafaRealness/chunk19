  it 's a political union now , so people do care ... 
  it still is n't much of a political union at all . 
  look at how it works : each * national * government needs to accept the eu 's legislation before it ever gets passed , plus the commission is made up of people assigned * by * the member states so the council of ministers ( your own ministers ) request the commission ( that they appointed like all other member states ) to draft a legislation , and have the power to stop it . 
  it still remains * very * intergovernmental rather than an actual political entity . 
   i never said usa did n't act out of self interest . 
  but you should be happy with them regardless . 
  you know what world people lived in before the usa became a military might ? 
  one filled with wars and unstability . 
  why should i be happy when they supported a dictatorship that killed part of my family ? 
  i will * never * be happy with that . 
  and to say that people lived in a world filled with war and instability before the us is extremely a huge lie , because even * now * with a military superpower usa we still have this world , just not in europe . 
  do you think that the people whom have died their beloved ones in south america , in africa , in asia , in the middle east etc. . . are happy , especially with wars that were initiated by the us ? 
   the eu will stop putin ? 
  if trump decides to remove all american military equipment from eastern europe they are completely fucked . 
  they could brush up on their russian because they 'll be speaking in really soon . 
  if he makes a deal with erdogan we would be fucked even harder . 
  and that is exactly why france and germany already sent their own armies to cooperate with the baltic authorities against potential russian aggression . 
  keep in mind that russia may seem like this superpower but the fact is that even their economy is roughly the same as italy 's ( which is ridiculously tiny for a country as big as * russia * ) and they do not uphold even half the power they had militarily as they did during the ussr . 
  russia is n't * that * powerful to begin with , and even if the usa leaves us entirely , we have * a lot * more allies . 
   the sovereign debt crisis which we still contend with today for almost ten years . 
  with the exception of greece , and with introduction of far better budgetary control and syncing between states , this is n't really proving to be a lasting issue . 
  ireland had a swift recovery , portugal is recovering , and italy is even a net contributor . 
   russian aggression which divides opinions as eastern europeans fear they might be abandoned by the west . 
  i agree with this , it 's genuinely a complication that we 're facing today . 
  for me , a comprehensive eu army would greatly answer these issues , or at least a mini-nato for all eu members . 
   the refugee crisis which pitted those countries who embraced immigration and those who fear of loss of cultural identity . 
  you 'd be amazed , portugal for example welcomes immigration and was welcoming to `` refugees '' whom have since went away to wealthier states ( france , mainly ) . 
  for me when it comes to non-eu migration the eu should have far less of a say ( i am strictly against the refugee quota for example ) and each state should have its own . 
  refugees ( actual ones , not economic migrants ) must , for me , be addressed with strict measures concerning integration . 
  for example , when i moved to france i learned french and always followed french social norms , and the state that accepts a refugee ( or any new resident ) must strive for the same . 
   you mentioned co-dependent which is probably the problem here because the problems of certain member states can drag down many others . 
  so why should individual nation state content with problems that does n't concern them ? 
  the truth is that there are various theories relating the `` why '' of european integration , i personally believe in mainly neo-functionalism ( but keep in mind that there are others like liberal intergovernmentalism that are also very important ) . 
  we * need * trade with each other to prosper , and the reduction of obstacles is essentially what we need in order to make trade efficient and thus , thanks to efficient trade , we can prosper far better than otherwise . 
  the problem with this is that bigger economies would have a bigger power , and thus here comes liberal intergovernmentalism , which , with the case i cited with the emu project , was a way to make smaller states still have a say while also remove barriers to ensure the fluidity and cooperation of our industries . 
  individual nation states fully isolated can not prosper the same way as nation states that cooperate and work together , and you can argue that maintaining * just * a trade zone would be best but it would institute a lot of problems for trade due to different standards and laws ( try buying a culinary mixer from canada , even free trade does n't make regulations as easy due to different legislations ) , and to solve this you could argue that maintain it at the level of a * common market * would be best , but that poses two problems : ** who ** decides what the standards and regulations are ? 
  and the smaller states would ultimately be dominated by economically more powerful ones ; furthermore this could degenerate very quickly into an intra-european trades war and before you know it everything 's falling appart . 
  i agree with the points you 've raised , and the eu is sure far from perfect , but the thing is that europe is a bunch of small nation states ( that themselves are n't even that homogeneous ) that rely gravely on each other for economic prosperity . 
  to address this particular case and ensure that europe remains as economically sane as possible * without * instigating trade wars with each other nor being dominated by the most powerful member ( s ) . 
   can you tell me who to vote for to appeal the upcoming copyright law once that is through ? 
  or who should i vote for if i want to smoke menthol sigs ? 
  i can vote for people in the parliament , but they do n't have the ability to repeal these laws . 
  in your case ( and do your own research to see if you agree with this party 's policies ) i 'd say you 'd want to vote for parties aligned with the alde ( vvd and d66 are aligned with them for example ) and they tend to oppose these types of laws as well as propose constructive alternatives for europe . 
  the pvv however is part of the eaf which all they do is basically refuse any further legislation or change , while also not proposing better alternatives , and ultimately even motion to remove certain european rights . 
   i mean , the dutch commisioner is put forth by mark rutte 's vvd . 
  they barely even have 20 % of the vote in our elections . 
  now he and all the other commisioners i had no influence in putting there , can write laws for my country . 
  even write laws that overwrite our current laws . 
  it 's no wonder people do n't feel represented . 
  it 's not really the vvd in the dutch case , the vvd is about a fifth of the entire tweede kamer ( which itself is impressive considering we have tonnes of parties ) . 
  the dutch commissionner is put forth by the * alliance * formed in the tweede kamer , so if you want real , actual change , do n't vote for the pvv that wants to * go against our own constitution and laws * and whose entire plans for the netherlands fit in * one * page ( the sp 's party programme for example was 68 pages and detailed with sources for their claims ) . 
  but instead vote for parties that support your views with * facts * and realistic expectations , plus , it 's already questionable if the pvv is even * legal * in our country because of the way it willingly circumvents dutch law . 
  again , the eu can not really write laws for member states , it can * draft * them at best , the one who really applies laws are the member states themselves ( why else do you think that every single new legislation needs to be approved by our ministers ? 
  what is n't reported on when it comes to eu matters ? 
  oh , for some reason i read serbian , sorry about that . 
  are slovene-croats , or croat-slovenes a thing ? 
  like , do you two have mixed people in between ? 
  slovenia and croatia seem very friendly . 
   in the late 40s we did n't have a eu ... because we were building it , and ever since we did * oh look * we have n't had an issue . 
   say what you want about the usa btw , but without them , china could 've been steamrolling whole asia , including the south pacific sea . 
  now that would 've created fucked up tensions . 
  because that 's in europe , and the usa sure as fuck has n't instigated war itself . 
  the us is just as selfish as everyone else ( ourselves included ) so do n't delude yourself . 
   putin could 've just recreated the ussr , who to oppose them if not for america ? 
  putin could not due to the fact that russia is n't that powerful to begin with . 
  the eu can also very easily fuck up any russian threat . 
   seriously , they are a great power with great responsibility , and that comes with fuck ups . 
  great fuck ups even . 
  but they do prevent countries from going nazi germany style , blitzkrieging all over the place . 
  they did the * direct exact opposite * when it came to my country and our former colonies , and south america , and the middle east , etc. ... 
  the reason they want europe to be at peace is because we are economically important to their stability , just like they are important for ours , it 's not because of this `` almighty responsability '' because if they gave a fuck about responsability they would own up to what the us has done . 
  you * can * vote for the parliament , the parliament has the power to entirely dissolve the commission ( or as you call it , `` the guy writing laws in the eu '' ) . 
  the parliament has the power to refuse any law as well ( happens often as well ) . 
  if you take a look at the long history of eu change regarding functioning and legislation with the nice , maastricht , lisbon , etc. . . treaties , you 'd be amazed at the rate of change within the eu . 
   there is only one way for us to get rid of these laws once they are through , and that is to vote for a anti-eu party . 
  to leave the eu . 
  you could also vote for parties * in the european elections * that do not support these laws , and in your * national * elections erect ministers that wo n't accept them . 
  the solution is n't really to leave the eu , that 's basically cutting off your hand because you hurt your finger . 
  the better solution is to firstly learn how the eu operates , and vote for those who really defend your values that are going to be represented in the eu , instead of voting for , for example , ukip and present farage who is already the laughingstock of europe along with wilders and lepen . 
  i understand that you may feel like the eu is going against your interest , but be reasonable with how it works , and how * you * as a citizen of the united kingdom who can vote , and a european union citizen who can vote , have the power to change it . 
  it prevented escalations between spain and portugal , and also rising tensions in the late 40 's . 
  if you paid attention to countries outside the eu , you 'd see that there * has * been a lot of military action and even downright war , whereas in the eu that can not happen because we 're co-dependent on each other and thus if one of us decides to invade anyone we 'd be shooting ourselves in the foot * massively * . 
   the usa is why we do n't have wars anymore . 
  the same usa that supported my country 's dictatorship that went to war with its colonies over independence even against our wishes , and funded other militia groups as well ? 
  or the usa that invaded iraq for no apparent reason ? 
  i agree that nato definitely protected war against ** non-nato members ** but the truth is that if two nato members fight with each other then nato is pretty much thrown out the window . 
   yeah , i guess you 've forgotten the 2005 referendum in your country huh ? 
  for the constitutional treaty that never passed ? 
  that then was recycled into the lisbon treaty while guaranteeing ireland ( that later had a second referendum and * passed since changes were made and it was satisfied with the arrangement * ) clausules ensuring its views ? 
  it was rejected due to missing clausules that later were added and changes made . 
   those politicians are traitors , at home they are skeptics and in brussels they vote pro eu on everything . 
  so the * ministers * of your own country are to blame then ? 
  decide yourself , i mean , who exactly is the bad guy ? 
   yes true . 
  does not make the eu a superpower . 
  we 're not really a superpower because we 're 27 states cooperating ( primarily ) economically . 
   you would be the second biggest . 
  soon to be overtaken by china to become the third . 
  we 're being taken over by china who basically depends on foreign purchases and if left alone would basically collapse . 
  *  not sure what you 've been reading , but the uk has not stagnated harshly .
