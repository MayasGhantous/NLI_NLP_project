  the uk has not been overtaken by france either , this article ( although quite old now ) sums it up quite nicely and points out where the mistake was that lead to people think france was bigger . 
  germany is bigger yes , although on current demographic trends the uk is set to close the gap and overtake germany over the course of our working lifetime ( assuming you 're a millennial ) . 
  [ there 's already been a stagnation since the referendum , take a hint why ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/7cf6e546-12b6-11e6-91da-096d89bd2173 )  are you just saying this incorrect stuff for arguments sake ? 
  or do you genuinly believe some of it ? 
  do you live your life in a pro-eu propaganda echo chamber ? 
  if i lived in an eu propaganda echo chamber i would n't openly criticize it ( because the eu * does * have flaws on its design and functioning ) . 
  i believe that the eu is a great project and it is doing well with or without the uk , however i also do not deny that the ecb for example was quite irresponsible at times , and that the current arrangement we have with schengen regarding states that have a non-schengen border or sea access ( mainly italy , greece , and spain ) is in need of serious review especially now to address the refugee crisis ( a crisis i disagree a * lot * with some of the eu 's calls ) . 
  i believe that the eu is quite more transparent than , for example , the us government . 
  what i * do * admit is a problem is the lack of knowledge and education given about the eu . 
  in my school i was given no information about the eu 's inner workings what-so-ever and i believe that if i am going to be taught about the functioning of my government , i should be informed ( at least at a basic level ) on how the eu works . 
   tito is croatian , not slovenian . 
  somehow i feel like if you say anything remotely like this you 'll start a new yugoslav beef series ... may god save you . 
  go west !, 
  spain is pretty cool , and the c\u00f4te d'azur is beautiful as well . 
  and yet germany , italy , and france are still in the top 10 of the world 's biggest economies . 
  sum them up with the rest of the eu 's economies ( even excluding the uk ) and we are the biggest or second biggest . 
  the uk stagnated harshly as well ( to the point you got overtaken by france , and germany is still above you ) , does this mean the uk will seize to exist as is and that everyone inside is gon na separate into teeny tiny parts ? 
   no mandate from the people the commission is appointed by the member states themselves , the council of ministers are literally just the member state 's own ministers , and the parliament is directly elected . 
  ... so you 're saying that the * member states * and * the voters * are against the people ? 
  that 's quite new . 
   eu is a powerful anti democratic the commission is appointed by the member states themselves , the council of ministers are literally just the member state 's own ministers , and the parliament is directly elected . 
  what exactly makes it anti-democratic ? 
  you ... you really do n't know how the eu works do you ? 
  here 's an example : in the 80 's the deutschmark was dominating other currencies because west germany was economically the strongest by far , and in 1989 when the wall finally was demolished and reunion talks started with east germany , europe knew that germany would simply be too big for the existent european framework and be too powerful . 
  thus they introduced the emu project , that way * everyone * has a say over monetary policy and is not forced to bend to germany 's currency changes ( compare the deutschmark and the guilder fluctuations for an example ) . 
  the eu exists so that we are co-dependent and can not be dominated by * one * but by * all * member states . 
  by making decisions co-dependent , we ensure that member states are not pushed over and overly dominated by bigger ones like germany , plus the eu has an equal power of veto even for the teeny tiniest states like luxembourg . 
  same here !, 
   but with the soon to be loss of the uk , and with an ever decreasing share of the global economy , it is now impossible . 
  anything to support these claims ? 
  the eurozone outperformed the us and economically the eu is going stronger and stronger with the exception of greece . 
  the uk may have been a great contributor but the truth is that it 's not at all needed for the eu to succeed . 
   because i care about humans ? 
  yet you support the division of the union that prevented us from going to war , that has brought stability to post dictatorships , and that has even instituted the highest standards to date . 
  not to mention human rights ... 
  there 's lots to criticize when it comes to the eu , but pretending to care about humanism when the eu actually helped * far * more than any other entity in a pan-european perspective is just dishonest and lazy . 
  i lost my shit at that may vs sturgeon one , that one was pretty damn funny . 
  allow me to sorta steal the thread but if you care about hiv , check out what the prep is . 
  this pill reduces the chances of contamination up to 90 % ( ! ) . 
  * protecteth thineself *, 
  that part in supermarkets where you get free samples . 
  * i fucking fell off my chair laughing oh my god *, 
  what , do n't you ? 
  we got ta make gouda somehow !, 
  * exactly , oh god *, 
  it 's even more awkward to read in a portuguese version i found where they took every sentence in spanish and translated it * literally * without taking into account how it sounds in portuguese . 
  i remember ye dayes of olde , where i pirated * every single possible thing * in portugal . 
  good times . 
   the netherlands is a racist country where proud turks are hated and beaten up by police . 
  i 'm in the netherlands , one of my best friends is turkish , lots of turks in our city too ... never saw this happening and most of them believe that erdogan is a huge sourpuss that wants to be a dictator , plus they also agree with the ban on rallies . 
  the fuck are you on about ? 
  not here !, 
  as an immigrant . 
  * oh god please no . 
  yeah , that 's part of the supranational character of it , however all eu legislation must also be approved by the council of ministers , and proposals are made by the commission ... which both are heavily still very much intergovernmental interaction and cooperation . 
   eu is pretty much the only government well , the eu is more of a hybrid between supranational authority and an intergovernmental association ... 
  i bloody * wish * it was a government to be honest . 
  actually not that great , in 2014 only 5.5 % of our energy was from renewable sources , plus we still have coal mines that need a transitional model towards greener energy . 
  the netherlands itself is already doing great , but that does not mean it does n't need to continue its efforts . 
  as for their stance on immigration , it 's far from `` let 's continue being green and let shit loads of immigrants and refugees in '' , ( which was never really the case for any party ) they want to actually integrate the ones whom are already here , especially with regards to * speaking bloody dutch * and societal norms . 
  they defend that there is room for difference regarding religion and the usage of headscarves but always within the limits of dutch law ( so women are to be treated the same as men , children have rights , etc. . . ) . 
  * how bloody dare you be so offensive !? 
  * cheetos are tasty , do n't compare them to * that * thing . 
  not at all sure , but if i renounce my citizenship , and then try to get them back , i risk getting bit in the ass and having my dutch one revoked ( unless i 'd become stateless ), 
  what the fuck does it have to do with jews ? 
  is it just because it 's german and anything german = anti-semitic ? 
  what the fuck . 
  i fully agree with what you say , and i believe that dutch politics is definitely in that situation . 
  i think that parties seriously need to answer these questions to prevent idiots like wilders from going up . 
   i mean , look at david davis ' face , this man is a snide , untrustworthy , cunning , smug little cunt usually i always think these are subjective but * jesus christ * he looks exactly what you just said . 
  he 's sorta like a villain in a 90s movie that wants to destroy the hero 's beloved place to build a mall or something . 
   his debate performance was entirely focussed on trying to provoke and be the ` tells it like it is ! ', 
  guy . 
  same can be said for his * entire * campaign . 
  his plans for the netherlands are the most ridiculous sad excuses for a party plan i 've ever seen , they are * one fucking page * , plus he refused several other debates and programmes because he knew he 'd get called out on his bs . 
  he is literally acting like trump . 
  i know , i was merely saying that the netherlands does n't really seem to care , which is good , i think everyone here seems aware that erdogan is just showbiz . 
  aaaah , well , she likely was since she is in helsinki on a holiday , so maybe that was the issue . 
  that 's weird , one of the requirements to have dutch citizenship via naturalization is , once you get it , you renounce to any other citizenships you may hold . 
  i literally just said that erdogan really ca n't affect the netherlands with words ... 
  it 's pretty clear it 's just a showbiz for his position in turkey ( which is partially why nobody here gives a fuck ), 
  how was voting from abroad ? 
  i have this dutch friend who 's currently in helsinki and for some reason she could n't vote so she asked another dutchie here to vote * for * her apparently . 
   especially cda wants to revoke double nationalities wait but is n't double nationalities already pretty much gone as is ? 
  i mean , there are small exceptions but not generally ... right ? 
  ** how ** ** dare ** ** you ** but in all seriousness , there is nearly nothing erdogan can say that will actually matter to the dutch . 
  thing is , the dutch are very good at keeping cool and not giving a shit . 
  for me he 's doing what * every * gay singer does ... show abs , simple but super active 8-count choreography , leather shoulder pads like beyonc\u00e9 ... 
   the elected bureaucracy ... bruh . 
   us education is just bad . 
  that 's assuming they could * afford * to be educated !, 
  3 options basically : 1-no border changes , everything remains the same and the common travel agreement ( cta ) is respected . 
  why is this a bad option ? 
  because no border checks = eu citizens still are able to go there and northern ireland , although it can keep trading with the republic , will likely need to still follow eu standards ( good luck with that ) . 
  plus if this is a thing , then indyref2 can say `` see ? 
  we can be in the eu like ireland without a border ! '', 
  2-reinstate border checks but still let irish/british citizens through . 
  this might instigate some difficulties with trading and travel since it 'll make everything slower and it 'll impose a bit of a barrier between the two ( but * mainly * the good friday agreements would likely be followed ) . 
  3-ditch the cta and reinstate full border controls . 
  this is the `` prepare for hell on earth '' option as this would clearly fuck up trade with the republic of ireland ( something northern ireland needs ) as well as instigate possible anti-unionist sentiments ( and it does n't help that the unionists are for the first time a minority in the northern irish parliament ) .
