  for me , it would me more expensive to revitalise every single national military strengt individually . 
  by working together and setting common goals and defense priorities , we can merge what we have and in order to achieve them . 
  on the other hand , the investments required to make a country like lithuania stand a good chance against russia ( even if russia itself is n't * that * powerful to begin with ) would be * far * more expensive . 
  cooperation in this domain makes sense in order to stimulate an expansion of european defense forces , as well as limit `` locking '' countries out of any defense due to their difficulties with military spending and the potential of a nato-end ( i doubt it will happen , but i also doubt that nato will be as effective as it once was ) . 
  the uk , if it were to stay in the eu , could merely stop vetoing this decision and instead demand an opt-out from this , just like schengen and the euro . 
   you know , i 've had a few of these discussions about the eu on here and what really strikes me is there is a genuine feeling of abandonment and that makes me sad . 
  i 'm trying to put my finger on why pro eu sentiment is so weak here . 
  if you discount a hostile right wing press , most of us are smart enough to ignore their printed clickbait . 
  i think it goes back to the treaty of lisbon . 
  in his 2006 election manifesto tony blair promised a referendum on that treaty , then promptly reneged on it . 
  people were not happy but as was his way he just ignored them . 
  but people did not forget . 
  i feel personally if i was asked in such a vote did i want to become an eu citizen i would have voted yes but i was not given that choice , hence my '' never in '' comment earlier . 
  from then on because we were forced in to political union , the eu became some sort of quasi oppressor from which nothing good ever came , despite the good that it does . 
  he should have given us that vote , it would have squashed the far right tories who pushed for the referendum . 
  this could all have been avoided . 
  we have had numerous referendums all over europe talking about different decisions the eu does , and fact is that they early always get `` hijacked '' for different utilisations . 
  the referendum held in the netherlands that showed a result against ukraine was not at all against ukraine itself , and instead we saw that there was an overwhelming participation of eurosceptic people against an underwhelming europhile participation . 
  this generates a situation that there are essentially anti-eu referenda every bloody tuesday , but the fact is that most of these people are uninformed , or are also voting to `` stick it to the man '' and also wanting to make a point while voting for something completely different . 
   i 'm sorry for your suffering under the euro , there really needs to be a bit of effective fiscal policy flexibility in it for individual nations . 
  the euro was not at all the issue , the real issue was our governments going on huge shopping sprees and then `` forgetting '' about the bill . 
   as for nato i feel you are being a bit unfair . 
  we maintain the largest military in europe , we are about to commission one of two new supercarriers and provide personnel in germany and many other european states . 
  all of this contributes massively to europe 's defence but which we have to pay for but is never mentioned in contribution terms . 
  nato protects all of europe and is in everybodys interest . 
  nato however is putting under the test nowadays , and europe , in my opinion , seriously needs an alternative , especially since it is no secret that the us ( by far the largest contributor ) is ... well , under trump ( i 'll keep it at that ) . 
  so for the sake of resting assured that europe does not suddenly become entirely unprotected , it is a good option . 
  i am in favor of nato but i also see the eu as in need of intra-european protection . 
   on the subject of an eu army it 's a possibility but a massive expense . 
  europe seems happy to let the us bear that cost in nato but for me they are pivoting towards the pacific . 
  if we are to have one then start planning and investing because if the us pulls out then we will be caught with our pants down . 
  the expense may not be all that huge at all , as it mainly is not at all a * creation * of a brand new army , but rather a synchronization of existing armies to an extent . 
  this would make cooperation between different national armies far easier and more effective , especially under the potential threat outside the eu ( for example , further eu military cooperation can serve as a far better protection in the waters of the mediterranean ) . 
  better yet , build the ** dam ** . 
  ** oh no please no ** *** the horror ***, 
  yeah i know , sorry i 'm a little bit drunk right now . 
  i am 99 % sure that britain would be fully okay with everything in the eu and would become the most europhile country ever if we renamed it the `` british empire '', 
   the political systems are different but this probably because in the uk we like our government to be an executive not a committee so they can react quickly to arising situations . 
  no criticism of your way intended . 
  the thing is that even within the uk framework of decision-making , which is heavily comparable to most other european systems . 
  the sole difference is that it is essentially a binary system when it comes to decisions with tories vs labour ( everyone else is heavily ignored ) . 
  the dutch system for example requires compromise because the voting is so divided into different parties , so coalitions and negotiations always , * always * happen . 
  if the uk had a more diversified electorate and there was the end of `` i 'm not gon na vote for them because they are small and it wo n't matter as much '' culture , then there would be high differences . 
   you have to look at a bit of history before you label us a blocking country . 
  for example the erm a bad idea and we chose to join anyway to help integration . 
  black wednesday happened and we had to withdraw from the erm at an estimated cost , then , of # 3.4 billion to the uk.now if you compare the erm to the euro crisis in southern europe then countries like greece are being demolished but they ca n't leave the euro , they are tied in and the misery is ongoing . 
  the uk chose not to join the euro . 
  so blocking is a poor word , we apply experience and common sense ( mostly ) where we see fit and try to avoid the consequences of well meaning but potentially dangerous policies . 
  my country ( portugal ) also suffered heavily from the southern european general economic crisis , and the euro actually helped us recover . 
  this was made through austerity and following eu goals and recommendations on reforms . 
  the country is still recovering but it is nearly back on its feet , not to mention that greece is actually pretty uncooperative with eu reccomendations , and it shows . 
  the uk has veto 'd decisions far more than any other country , and demanded opt-outs ( which i am perfectly fine with it , except the rebate and its functioning ) which makes the uk one of the least integrated parts of europe and makes a pan-european rule far more complicated . 
  the current example of a european army is a great example since the uk is looking for its own interests ( nato mainly ) but not on the interest of the union itself , plus the negotiations with the uk ( because vetos do not mean a full end to it ) are constantly a stalemate since most of the time the uk does n't even accept a simple opt-out . 
   your english is excellent btw and good luck with your studies . 
  thanks !, 
  also , unrelated , for your next holidays , consider going to porto and ordering a francesinha , you will * not * be disappointed . 
  i am shaking and quivering in fear . 
  portugal is orange in some countries ... but consider this ... na europa de leste , o nome mais comum para portugal \u00e9 * portugalia * ( sim , tal como o restaurante ) . 
   the common market , in 1973 , was about trade only . 
  sorry i should have been a bit more specific . 
  if you want trade only , then the efta is the way to go , look at norway for example . 
   as for changing it internally , what do you think all of those vetoes were about . 
  have you ever sat on a committee ? 
  trying to get six people to agree can be challenging but 28 ? 
  almost impossible . 
  i am studying european studies here in the netherlands , and the uk has , for the longest time and by far more than any other european country , a blockade to the integration process . 
  the main problem is that british political culture highly based on `` all or nothing '' ideas where there is no agreement and a part always ends up losing , whereas the wider european political culture tends to be * very * different : there is * always * a compromise and negotiations are * always * a zero-sum game ( you lose as much as you win ) . 
  during the empty chair crisis ( by france ) the luxembourg compromise was achieved to row back from the qualified majority to grant the power of veto back , but with a new rule : negotiations do not stop when you veto they just keep going and find a compromise . 
  so the uk has a * very * different political culture that does not bode well in europe in the least , but if the uk were more willing to compromise and cooperate with the european institutions then * maybe * there would n't be such problems . 
   as for the shitfest i think we will be the worst off after brexit but a democratic choice was made , please do n't take it personally . 
  i do n't , however i care a great deal because this democratic choice was a non-binding referendum to get * out of the eu * yet now the uk has may who wants to throw everything out the window , putting the rights of my colleagues at work and at university at risk , and even making northern ireland and gibraltar at risk ( not to mention scotland who benefits a lot from the eu as well ) . 
  how times have changed ... 
  sad !, 
   the rebate is there to counter things like cap which hugely benefits the french , do n't get me started on the cfp . 
  well it 's a hugely common mechanism for * all * europeans including brits , and there is * much * more to fund than just the cap , plus the cap was made exclusive to western countries for a really long time . 
   i totally agree with the common market but not the lisbon treaty which was forced upon us by blair . 
  so you agree with freedom of movement ? 
  most brexiters seem to disagree , and so does may . 
  you can fully be part of the common market outside the eu via the efta . 
   i actually like europe and have been on many holidays there . 
  europeans are good people , i just do n't agree with the current form of the eu . 
  yet * we * are all europeans but not you ? 
  if you disagree with the current form of the eu then why instead of trying to readdress it towards a brighter form based on actual debate and action , the uk prefers to abandon it in a cringeworthy shitfest ? 
  good fucking luck driving through zuid brabant , or as some call it , `` belgium '' . 
   soon we have nucler pants . 
  i thought you were serious but then this . 
  happy birthday !, 
  now please send me some of those snacks i 'm hungry . 
   say farewell to # 11.2 billion which according to you pays for nothing and good luck finding somebody else to pay it . 
  i 'll also say goodbye to a member that keeps veto-ing everything . 
  not to mention , i said that the uk is not paying its * fair share * because of the huge bloody rebate it gets on every payment it does . 
   people like you are the reason i have never felt european . 
  for me i 'm not leaving , i was never there . 
  so basically it 's my fault you feel like you are never european because `` you 've never been there '' even though your country is in europe itself . 
  lol okay , whatever floats your boat . 
  since when is the uk paying for anything ? 
  it does n't even pay its fair share to the eu budget with its rebate , but that 's about to end since you 're on your way out . 
   with comments like that i really wonder why we joined in the first place . 
  different generations , different ideas , besides , there is still a * great * number of british people who are actually decent , do research about these issues and argument correctly . 
  hell , even in the referendum the margin was pretty narrow , so yeah i 'm pretty happy people like * you * are leaving .
