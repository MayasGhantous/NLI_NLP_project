  ** fuck you just you wait till i get my gayness all over that place **, 
   what superstate ? 
  my wet dreams probably . 
  * oh baby that federation * but in all seriousness federation merely is not at all an option , especially at this point . 
  that is n't even really being discussed . 
  sure there are people ( like me ) who would love a federalized europe but realistically that 's merely not gon na happen nor should we force it to happen . 
  we still ove the eu though , brazil , angola and mozambique are great partners but * by god * europe offers far more . 
  dude ... dude ... ** dude ** fr eu de ... fr+de = eu ** we have cracked the code **, 
  if * these * are record numbers , especially considering that they are dropping , then that 's plainly sad . 
  thanks bro !, 
  * my name is no . 
  my sign is no . 
  my number is no . 
  * sorry , could n't resist , i 'll show myself out ... 
  i 'm prepared , i came to the comments section specifically for that actually . 
  i 'm slowly starting to actually enjoy brexit banter . 
  i personally am already stocking up on kebab to be honest . 
  oh , do n't stress about it , we know you 're not at all crazy . 
  be polite to us and we 'll treat you politely , that 's all . 
  hope to see you soon , the netherlands is a great place to visit , make sure to check madurodam . 
  but ... but what if they do n't dance ?? 
  that is , sadly , what is on demand . 
  in my small town in france nearly all the workers did n't speak french and were pretty much just doing the work with the bare essentials . 
  i believe that there should be further requirements , but helaas they would likely go unfollowed . 
  the reality is * anyone * who is n't physically disabled can do this job , but it is normal that not everyone is * willing * to do it . 
  you 're absolutely right to say that contractors subcontract subcontractors who themselves do the same , resulting in the cheapest possible price for the work . 
  that 's capitalism for ya i guess . 
  thanks !, 
  q 10 : what do you call the famous sport where players form two teams and play with a ball using only their feet ? 
  stealing that . 
  i believe that workers in construction sites should minimally understand words related to their safety and construction itself . 
  this should not be up for companies since they will cut corners no matter what . 
  an a2 , a minimal introductory level , already understands a person to be able to grasp general context of something , and with that it would be possible for them to ask crucial questions , even very simple things , as well as communicate their basic needs and concerns . 
  i still do n't see what is unreasonable to expect a minimum , an extreme basic understanding , of terms employed in a country to prevent entirely isolated people . 
  i moved to france without speaking a word of french and trust me when i say that france looked * extremely * different back when i did n't and a lot of immigrants who do not learn the language do n't dare to ask questions or communicate concerns because they are limited on their language skills , so these go silent and can potentially generate misunderstandings and even dangers in such a place like a construction site . 
  that is why you make it a requirement , and hell , i am good with a solid a2 level . 
  extremely basic command of a language takes very little to learn . 
  what makes you think that people who work low-end jobs are not that clever though ? 
  for me they are unskilled and can not find a better job which hey , happens . 
  do you think that they would just stay in their countries if they were required to prove an extremely basic and simple language level ? 
  they will keep coming , but this one tiny requirement will ensure that the teeny tiniest communication can take place without huge hassle . 
  b1-level is n't really that high at all , you ca n't use it for much but for simple low-end jobs it can be useful . 
  there is a great difference between having a b1 level and actually having a fully usable and capable command of the language , which for me would be really a c1 level which is much higher . 
  i speak 5 languages in different levels , and although it is very attractive to speak multiple languages , other skills matter a lot as well . 
  speaking two languages does not make you a professional translator nor interpreter , so you must rely on other skills . 
   it gets ... wait for it ... clogged !, 
  ** underrated . 
   this is hardly fox news . 
  this is a serious , public television politics-oriented television program . 
  yes , but again , it is a public tv show , whose statistics ' sample of the population are their viewers . 
  this would n't be a huge issue but the fact is that they are focusing on a particular demographic group and thus statistics are not representative enough and are often wrong in these cases . 
   they have their own opinion panel , which makes them one of the main polling agencies in the netherlands ( especially on political matters ) . 
  the poll in question was actually explained in detail : there were 27,000 respondents , and the answers were weighed for six variables : age , sex , level of education , marital status , geographical spread and real political preference as expressed by what they voted for in 2012 . 
  fox news fits the same criteria for the us , and eenvandaag is * a tv show * so obviously it has a viewership which can not really be an accurate representation of the population of the netherlands . 
   well , if they underestimated brexit by 20 % , support for nexit might be even higher in the netherlands . 
  works the other way around too , for me we need a better source than a tv show on npo1 . 
  i can only find this one and another one done by peil.nl ( yet they were quite wrong about 2012 and the pvv 's actual proportion , like usual ) . 
   germany pays reduced contributions , but nobody talks about it because it 's written into eu law . 
  the uk did n't have the sway for anything similar , so got a hugely controversial rebate that becomes front page news once every seven years . 
  i 'm actually trying to find anything about this . 
  i ca n't find anything . 
   in 2015 , germany had net payments per capita lower than the uk . 
  that 's despite the uk having a much lower gdp per capita . 
  you 're definitely right that [ germany had a higher gdp than the uk in 2015 ( 3.0533 trillion vs 2.2138 trillion ) ] ( https://www.google.nl/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gnp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;idim=country:deu:fra:usa&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_adj_nnty_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:deu:gbr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) the uk in 2015 [ contributed 18.209 billion $ ] ( http://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/unitedkingdom_en#budgets_and_funding ) for a population of [ 61\u00a0715\u00a0810 people ] ( http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/ ) which means that , per capita , the uk contributed 295.04 $ germany [ paid up 24.283 billion $ ] ( http://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/germany_en#budgets_and_funding ) for a population of [ 80\u00a0688\u00a0545 ] ( http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/germany-population/ ) . 
  this means that per capita germany paid 300.95 $ per person . 
  so germany is paying * more * than the uk in terms of contributions adjusted by population . 
  which makes sense since germany has a more powerful gdp per capita ( all data from 2015 ), 
  what did ireland and denmark give ? 
  the uk , * if * it reapplies for eu membership should not have any opt-outs . 
  what makes the uk so special that it can freely get in and out like that without following the eu 's rules ? 
  apply the rules , and if the uk wants opt-outs then the uk must give in more than others . 
  never said the contrary . 
  i personally welcome both ( eu ) immigrants who are willing to do these jobs for less , but also this decision . 
  for me i think that if you want to work full-time on a country , you should be required to speak the language at least b1-level ( not really that hard to achieve ) . 
  why stop there ? 
  * think bigger * . 
  let 's start with northern ireland , gibraltar , scotland , then let 's start taking * bits * of england . 
  ** laughs in evil brussels european **, 
  it 's pretty hard to find frenchmen willing to do these jobs . 
  immigrants have less expectations and are more willing to do crappy work nobody else wants to . 
  i agree with working out a new correcting mechanism of budget contributions , that for me is important for any member state . 
  i do n't agree that the uk would be paying more than its fair share , since contributions were the same for every member state . 
  i expect the eu to have a set of rules ( that may change over time ) and apply them . 
  i disagree that these should be concessions and instead these should be general rules for all incoming member states . 
  the uk , if it tries to join the eu after brexit and the rules of membership have not changed , does * not * deserve exceptions and exempts based solely on the fact that it is the uk . 
  * should * there be the absolute need for concessions and opt-outs * before * the uk gets in again , then the uk should compromise and give something back , sole issue is that there is not much it * can * give in trade for an opt-out to for example the euro . 
  the uk may be a big source of funds , but keep in mind that it is also a source of constant veto 's and very slow integration . 
  it was the uk that brought us characters like thatcher and that decided to reject much of the proposals ( more than anyone ) , so it seems that the uk does not at all want to be part of the `` ever closer union of the peoples of europe '' as stated in the treaty of rome , but rather would find its place better in the efta in my opinion . 
  the eu and the uk can fully have great relationships even with the uk outside of it , besides , this is in the case if the uk * ever * wants to join back . 
  member states with borders with non schengen members , like italy france and poland are , have agreed to be solely responsible for maintaining the safety of those borders . 
  finland deals with russia , poland deals with belarus , romania deals with moldova etc. . . 
  the eu has been putting italy and greece ( the two main entry points for illegal immigrants ) on blast for years for not taking up a higher guard . 
  i agree that italy and greece should do far more against this but i 'm not sure france is doing anything wrong with the calais , if anything they offered britain a pretty favorable deal with the current arrangement ( border checks on the french side instead of the british one ), 
  so everyone inside it ? 
  or just france ? 
  i found the [ perfet erdogan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-nojzg_4gq ) replacement in case we need one . 
  it really is uncanny . 
   if i could , i would vote to separate from n. ireland and scotland , but sadly that wo n't happen . 
  so england and wales by themselves ? 
   so people vote in the eu ( ireland , france , greece ) and the eu ignores them and tells them to vote again .
