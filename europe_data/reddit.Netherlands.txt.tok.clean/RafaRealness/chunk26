  i am not against the idea of compromises * if * they result in equal treatment for the uk as for other eu memberstates . 
  the uk deserves respect and consideration but not more than anyone else . 
  that is fair but i mean that * now * since the uk is leaving then it will lose membership and all concessions . 
  since it left , if it wants to come back in i welcome it wholeheartedly * but * we have rules and requirements in place we did not back when they * first * joined , so those opt-outs were fine . 
  now as a new member coming in , they are not at all special , they are aware of the obligations and the changes they must undertake just like any other country has to agree to in order to be accepted into the eu and it is their decision to take it or leave it . 
  the thing is , a great deal of boats and ferries to/from the uk/continental europe already go fully unchecked , so it is n't really an area that would change much at all . 
  i think that maybe the areas that * would * see the biggest change ( and * is * the topic for debate ) are the question of sovereignty as well as the calais . 
  in reality , not really because [ this ] ( http://lh4.ggpht.com/-preq5ssq-xi/ujk71pcguoi/aaaaaaaagau/ltikrrt4pgo/baarle-nassau-hertog-0%25255b2%25255d.jpg?imgmax=800 ) is what belgo-dutch borders look like for these places . 
  ** credentialsssss **, 
  how so ? 
  as a gay man , i am not crazy about it , those curls are just * so * stay-at-home mom . 
  he was in a talk show ? 
  i ca n't remember the last time i saw that kut on tv at all ( thank hell to be honest ) that 's actually a pretty sweet throwback , kudos to that guy . 
  yeah me too , and for me the uk ( no matter how much of a dick its being ) is still part of europe ( not the eu but still it 's not like they can just fuck off to a distant ocean , oh one can dream ) . 
  for me i think that every country sometimes needs to get its head out of its own ass on occasion . 
  france had the fucking empty chair crisis for example . 
  i just hate the extent that the uk is a ) rolling with all the bullshit and havoc they are creating b ) still denying having their heads up their ass ... 
  nl and be had no choice but agreeing , also we had the benelux !, 
  you see , the border between belgium and the netherlands is one of the most complicated messes in the world as it cuts through cities and houses ( as a rule : a house is located in the country where its front door is , even though there is one house that happens to be in both ) . 
  a great example of this is [ this sexy part of our border ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/baarle-nassau_-_baarle-hertog-en.svg/365px-baarle-nassau_-_baarle-hertog-en.svg.png ) i nearly always travel by plane , so for me it is pretty natural as well to just show my passport , besides it only takes like 2 minutes ( and that is also including checking your plane ticket and such , so i imagine checking someone in a car is even quicker ) . 
  it would be nice if the uk stopped doing * lots * of things unfortunately . 
  ah well , fancy a pint at ** eeeeviiiil ** brussels ? 
  ya know , since you can have freedom of movement to come over , and use your own money to pay for it as well . 
  i 'll meet you there !, 
   i do n't get why people are opposed to having to show a document when you cross an international border ? 
  i do n't mind it at all , and i think this should be done on all major roads ( but not in the border between belgium and the netherlands because otherwise we will have problems ... ) . 
  i think that we should make sure that the process does not leave the door open for fake documents to circulate around ( fake ids so you can move around the eu ) but also maintain a fast and simple experience for travelers . 
  i think we also need far better cooperation for europe 's wanted , especially in the case of that dude . 
  if europe manages to have a functional system to seamlessly check your identity ( very quickly and painlessly ) and also compare your identity to a database of wanted personnel , we could easily eliminate that problem . 
  maintain schengen but introduce a very small security feature for borders among member states ( and switzerland , and the efta ) . 
  but even without schengen the uk is part of the eu ( even if it is leaving ) so i can just as easily move there as i can to ireland or any other eu/efta memberstate ... 
  i understand you want control and i agree that it is a problem due to the uk 's attractiveness , however i still do n't see why * schengen * is the issue . 
  from what i can tell from the comments here , it 's mainly because the uk and ireland already had the cta and had nothing to gain from schengen at all back when they got their opt-outs , which makes sense . 
  how are these used though ? 
  i mean , where are these border checks ? 
  it 's an island so i 'd imagine perhaps ports , but that is very much the case for everyone in schengen as well ... 
  well , the uk could start by stopping its constant harbor of tax fraudsters from spain and portugal , or maybe stop its illegal imports of non-standardised chinese imports that the eu already warned against since they are * literally toxic * but sure , you do n't want our problems and we are dealing with trillions of illegal imigrants and want the uk to pay for it . 
  i am very glad people like you are leaving . 
  well , i am for a multi-speed eu but not for new countries . 
  if you are * in * the eu then feel free to refuse whatever bothers you since it was not part of the deal when you actually joined , but if you are trying to * get in * you do not get a say just yet and must accept what the direction is and * after * when something new pops up and you are against it then feel free to have an opt out . 
  membership first , opt outs later . 
  sorta . 
  i basically believe that the uk should not at all have as many concessions as it did inside the eu . 
  if the uk wants to be in the eu then i believe that the same rules should apply for it as for everyone else ( and that includes schengen , looking at you ireland ) . 
  if the uk wants the norway option , aka join the efta , which for me is * not * the same as the eu and therefore does not need to follow the same treatments , then by all means go ahead . 
  i merely do not see why the uk should be treated special outside or inside the eu/efta . 
  well , yes that 's actually a pretty good argument . 
  the cta is basically the same thing but with just ireland , right ? 
  ( i am not being sarcastic i am genuinely asking ), 
  i 'm okay with that , either get in the eu and assume all that entails without wanting special treatment , or stay out . 
  i do n't mind at all having the uk going for a norway-option either if it wants , as long as it is treated with the same respect as other states i 'm good . 
  but i mean * before * brexit , before it ever wanted to leave the eu or even end freedom of movement . 
  unless , of course , the uk never ever wished for it to begin with and wanted to keep it ireland-only . 
  again , what does it change for * an island * considering that you still manage your own borders ? 
  poland manages its own border with belarus , and romania deals with ukraine themselves ... do you believe that the uk and ireland suddenly would have no border defenses or something ? 
  cyprus still has them the sole difference is that eu citizens get to use the cypriot-citizen lines in the airports ... 
  why did n't ireland and the uk want to * both * join schengen as to produce the same effect between the two ? 
  then again , i am a bit glad they did not do that now , and instead have the cta . 
  the cta is n't dependent on the eu and now with brexit if they were in schengen then northern ireland would have a shiny new wall ... 
  well , for me there are more reasons to oppose the euro than just that . 
  i personally like having the euro , but we 're talking about a country that literally * burned euro notes * when there was a debate if they should or not join it . 
  i think that the british pound is still not only a reserve and world currency ( from which the uk benefits a lot as a financial big player in world economy ) but also it is deeply culturally embedded . 
  plus we can not deny that the euro still has issues that need to be addressed . 
  the value of the british pound , well , i 'm not sure what you mean , but it 's true that having control over your own currency gives you an advantage . 
  lower pound = easier exports since the uk is basically `` cheaper '', 
  well , for me this proves the need for more cooperation in terms of police and intelligence over these criminals . 
  does n't answer my question either , howcome the uk and ireland , both * islands with no land borders to the rest of europe * actually mind schengen that much ? 
  aside from one practical airport change , i do n't see much more ... 
  i honestly never understood why the uk ( and ireland ) oppose schengen . 
  i mean , there must be an actual reason but i genuinely wonder what it is . 
  as for the euro , yeah that is definitely something very hard to sell ... 
  especially to the uk i think . 
  they will always be welcome back on my books , but no concessions this time . 
  also poland : `` but by god we 're trying '' / s, 
  not really actually . 
  spain blocks any place that * ilegally * secedes and becomes independent . 
  scotland , however , can break away from the uk legally , whereas catalonia ( due to the spanish constitution ) can not legally do so . 
  kosovo , for example , has no recognition by spain because of this , however i believe that a legal scottish path towards independence would give spain no real reason to block anything . 
  so technically you should be charged with murder every time you stop life within your body that is not really a person ? 
  keep in mind that it is basically the same as exfoliation , masturbating ( if you 're a dude ) , and even taking antibiotics ... 
  it 's not `` someone '' , it 's a blob of cells that can not exist outside its host body , it 's a person when it can actually survive outside of it . 
  thanks for the insight !, 
  sounds interesting , never really thought about the chinese perspective . 
  really ? 
  how come ? 
  how 's the eu viewed by china ? 
  his gut feeling and fox news, 
  well again , you have to address these matters to the eu as we are all part of a bloody customs union and foreign policy tends to generally be be very similar between different member states . 
  if you want to treat eu member states differently while addressing matters that concern visas and customs , then remind yourself that we are a * union * on that aspect and thus have to deal with it . 
  this is * one * matter that is directed at the eu as we want our citizens to have equal footing regardless of country , if the us , an outsider , is being a nuisance to that ( not to mention all the shit different member states have to deal with because of the us ) then the eu can fully look into its powers and procedures to address it legally . 
  you do n't see us as equals ? 
  then tough tits for you , australia , canada , brunei and japan stopped discriminating between eu citizens and had their visa deals back , and it really was n't that big of a deal at all , so is the us that trumpified already that it can not accept to treat the eu as the eu when it comes to * travel * matters ? 
  well then if the us is unwilling then why should the eu be ? 
  we are different , but we all have standards , and as part of a union , we must stick together and not accept member states to have their status diminished just because you do n't like them . 
  we are together , so take it or leave it . 
  also , fix your grammar because i sometimes ca n't bloody understand you . 
  you maybe should, 
  * well except all the crazy pronunciation rules and fucking supremacy of the \u00eb over every other fucking letter *, 
  i mean , feel free to downvote it even more ; i do n't really mind . 
  you can make some jokes about my nationalities too if you want , i personally like 'em , haha .
