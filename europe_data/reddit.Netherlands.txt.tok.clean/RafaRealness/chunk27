  i 'm learning russian at uni and this one guy tried to pull this shit on our teacher as a joke ... she just groaned and left . 
  edit : can we address the fact that cryllic letters tend to be so even in terms of size and space ? 
  * they are so ... equal *, 
  i 'm half french so ... half the crap ? 
  i mean , i mainly eat dutch and portuguese food when i cook but i do n't mind the occasional french dish at all . 
  also [ you might wan na check this out ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=joke ), 
  damn , that is actual effort and commitment . 
  he reminds me a lot of those `` good patriot '' americans from like the 70s , where everything is about god and christianity vs communism . 
  everything they do n't like = ko\u043c\u043cu\u0438i\u0437\u043c\u0430 , and everything the * do * like = god 's personal creation . 
  am i the only one who gets that vibe ? 
  as a gay man , i am shook . 
  did n't finland just legalize gay marriage ? 
  i wonder how he reacted . 
   and successfully attacking three minorities in one sentence holy fuck , what did he say ? 
  ... alright i 'll say it ** english ** market . 
  for * food * . 
  i 'm scared . 
  so basically the uk cared too much what i thought about it to actually do anything ? 
  this just goes deeper and deeper . 
  so basically the uk was too much of a pussy to use what it already had ? 
  does n't help your case no matter how you turn it ... 
  fact is : ireland won largely and fucked off the uk proudly into a republic . 
  i no longer know if he 's a troll or not because of that , it 's way too much `` inglin shud be indipendent innit ? 
  we got 2 protekt arr ** sovrenteeh ** for the ** pewpel ** '', 
  i. . . i am shocked but surprised i * am * shocked this is a thing . 
  ** sold . 
  we ride at dawn . 
  most importantly : * would it join the eu ? 
  could the rest of ireland join ? 
  what about wales ? 
  what would you call it ? 
  well i said * no wars * and in 2014 i got a scare as my flight had to change trajectories in ukraine when * a fucking plane got shot down *, 
  it was a supranational union of national republics , but its government and economy were highly centralized in a state that was unitary in most respects . 
  so basically under the ussr you would basically be one country with states inside it . 
  is the usa not a country either ? 
  we saw that during a break on a lecture about the european union 's different representations , looks like a really fun show , might watch it next holidays !, 
  i am portuguese and i 100 % only came here for the shitfest imminent by this . 
  we all love a * nice hot hard * anschluss . 
  nah son , do n't spend your money on wars . 
  spend your money on being more attractive to the north , seduce it into * really * wanting to become part of the roi , and have a referendum and then ** annex the everliving bollocks out of it and never fucking let go **, 
  the eu * includes * those countries . 
  imagine the eu as a box of nearly 30 damn countries who all want to be treated fairly and equally within the box , but most of their citizens have their rights lowered by someone outside the box . 
  so the box decides that it wo n't grant the us ( outside the box ) the right to travel into the box if the us does not treat all of the box fairly . 
  if the eu allowed citizens from all states except texas , mississippi , alabama , florida and south carolina to be cleared for visa-free travel for tourism , would n't the us be pissed ? 
  same goes for the eu , treat us * all * with the due respect as we are * all * the eu . 
  says page not found for me . 
  well , it 's not really anti-british . 
  the uk is leaving the eu , and most likely we 'll just sort a deal that is beneficial for both sides , it 's not gon na try to attack us ^ ( just you fukkin try m8 ), 
   ** ( spaniards and portuguese ) - the spanish and portuguese ** are of the romantic tribe . 
  their religion is catholic . 
  a large proportion of their inhabitants are so ignorant , that they can not even read or write . 
  the spaniards are proud , and superstitious . 
  their favorite pastime is bullfighting . 
  ** triggernometry 5000 deluxe **, 
  no brakes !, 
  very true , i 'm always lowkey worried about my british classmates , because our studies will take 3 years to complete and i sure as heck do n't want them to go back . 
  plus one of them is dutch but has a british mother , she should n't have to go anywhere . 
   by fellas who know muy thai i thought muy thai was a spicy dish ... 
  i 'm not proud . 
  seconded . 
  i never understand why we insist on adding more and more to it jesus . 
  i 've never really been confused by chad and romania to be honest though . 
  i do n't really see it as an issue at all . 
  well the fact that you need to tell it to stop ... 
  nah they would say some shit like `` 200 terrorist riots in sweden , police force severely injured , sad ! '', 
  i am stealing this . 
  this joke is fucking underrated . 
  do n't be jealous ~, 
  that . 
  the . 
  joke . 
  they switched it to say republik \u00d6sterreich and 3 $ instead . 
  genuine question : what is the diversity policy for the police ? 
  that is part of the joke ... 
  it 's an australian coin ( and everyone mistakes austria and australia sometimes ), 
  not really , since we still need transliterations for names and such , even between languages that have different alphabets like russian and french do . 
  only in the serbian cryllic , other cyrillic-script languages do n't use it . 
  portuguese uses \u00f5 though , quite often too , it 's in the plural of most - \u00e3o words , like promo\u00e7\u00f5es . 
  well , i think that based on the fact that this is still a cruel reality nowadays in russia , at least it 's nice that this one got released . 
  it 's not like i 'm saying that russia is now the new capital of freedom, 
  i never thought about that actually ... well then again it 's not like some would n't compromise part of their religion for the sake of their own comfort . 
  this is a nicer step for russia . 
  i wonder if slowly we will see good developments like these happen more often . 
  same here , technically . 
  adoption is always a thing , and if europe runs out of babies then we can always just ask china or somewhere which is trying to reduce population for its spare ones and raise them as europeans . 
  huh ? 
  the eu has n't done jack shit when it came to scottish independence , it even refused to start talks with sturgeon before independence back in 2014 . 
  all they said is that if scotland is an independent country then they would be able to join the eu legally . 
  i entirely disagree with that , but even so , i 'd rather have the eu than what the uk will have to deal from now on . 
  have fun , britannia . 
  true that . 
  this is very true , though i think what he means is that when you need medical assistance , you do n't really pay a full-on price that will either mean you get no treatment nor mean that you will be indebted for life . 
  i think when people say `` free '' healthcare they mean `` free at the point of use '' rather than bloody communism-type free where everybody gets everything for free forever wooptedooo, 
  ** i do n't know where in europe that is but i am going to buy myself some damn plane tickets to it **, 
  i grew up with heidi in portuguese ... 
  i have never before heard this damn song in any language other than that . 
  i am having both a nostalgia and a little culture shock and by god i love it . 
  well , being pro-eu means very different things for very different people . 
  some believe that the eu should be a confederal entity , others a regional integration association , some believe it should be a federate body , and others want intergovernmental eu . 
  the eu right now is all of the above and neither , it is a complicated incomplete hybrid , and i for one prefer the federal eu rather than any of the other options , and i am pro-eu , and so are you but we just happen to disagree on what kind of future for the eu we want .
