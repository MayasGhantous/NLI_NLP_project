  remember that literally since 1957 the whole point of it all was `` an ever closer union between the peoples of europe '', 
  i live here , and in my experience , zuid oost is pretty much the same as almere , but closer and more expensive . 
   miffy who in the everliving hell called nijntje that ? 
  i am gon na wear black for the rest of my goddamn life , ca n't believe he 's gone . 
  he was the best dick . 
  well , to be fair , i believe the left is pretty corrupt as well , it 's just that it 's not as often caught nor as severe as these cases . 
  pahahahahaha . 
  good one . 
  tell that to ukraine . 
   bill gates is an ** american ** you should have stopped your sentence there because nearly all americans have * some * european ancestry but that does not make them european in the least . 
  you are right but moreover * how are you in the vatican holy damn tho *, 
  there 's always zuid oost , which has about the same reputation . 
  he is currently busy shouting at other parties for not making a coalition with his , and combating islam \u2122, 
  cold . 
  blooded . 
  killer . 
  fucking hell get the aloe vera . 
  ** next on cbs : the biggest loser ** * i tell you , i 'm absolutely the biggest loser , the biggest , everybody tells me so *, 
  all the balkans in my uni are super chill about it , even when they talk about kosovo and bosnia it 's always pretty chill . 
  yet on the internet it 's as if they are about to hit each other in the face with frying pans on the street . 
  * they ? 
  but there is only one , '' they '' are all the same * ** do n't attack me it is very clearly / s **, 
  i pass the motion that we finally get rid of the uk in eurovision as well . 
  ** there is no higher authority than eurovision **, 
  well i do n't reccomend missing out on their language , i think it sounds/looks really pretty . 
  problem is , by my experience some people get triggered if you call it serbian/croatian/serbocroat etc. . . 
  so yeah , caution ... 
  that is literally * the * reason i came here to be honest . 
  i usually just ignore these posts and go see europe 's beauty with my own damn eyes but c'mon you * never * turn down a good triggerfest , especially when it 's the balkans !, 
  if i , plus 100 of my friends vote for an anti-dutch party in the netherlands , is it unfair that we are n't gon na form coalitions ? 
  i 'm not saying the pvv is anti-dutch , but i am saying that they are getting their fair share of power : they get votes , votes get them seats in parliament , but if every other party 's voters are very much against the pvv , then that 's that . 
  it would be unfair to force the pvv into any more power even though the greater majority of people voted for parties who directly oppose them . 
  to be fair , the gdr had a pretty damn cool one at least . 
  can we start with switzerland first though ? 
  deus eult prettier borders / s, 
  well , for me it sounds stupid to care for one small comparison so i guess i do n't really care . 
  just like that . 
  trump is more universally familiar as a name than geert wilders is , so for explanation purposes , the two are very similar . 
  if i need to explain who trump is , i guess i 'd say '' american wilders , but actually won '', 
  well , mind if i take them off ? 
  oh switwerland , you 're so cute < 3, 
  my best guess is that he meant to spell geert , who is the leader of the partij voor vrijheid ( party for freedom , pvv ) of the netherlands . 
  literally just a dutch trump , wants to ban mosques and the qu ` ran , very anti-eu , etc. . . basically lepen but with even worse hair . 
  soooo maybe the '' we '' is supposed to be dutch people but the truth is it 's extremely unlikely he 'll be leader since nearly all parties refuse to form a coalition with him , and he definitely needs a majority to be leader , and even if he managed to form a coalition , he would n't at all be able to all he promised because a ) coalition b ) some stuff is anticonstitutional, 
  ** i am beyond salty and triggered ** ** which means i hate/love how well made this is , it 's very fucking accurate , good gob . 
  i lived near paris in a smaller community , a place with lots of jewish , black , asian , and mediterranean people . 
  it was a super charming place and everyone really felt `` french '' there , we all spoke french all the time and generally all were 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants who were just your average french joe . 
  * here * there was n't an issue . 
  ** however ** in the bigger cities like paris and lyon , i think that there * is * an association with physical appearance because they have far larger communities of less-integrated people , thus prompting the ( even if unconscious ) these people = this non-frenchness . 
  i think that if we strive to * fully * integrate these societies ( and should they refuse , they should be dismantled ) then maybe in the future , we can focus more and more on behaviour than in just race . 
  * it 's free real estate *, 
  ** there is so much shade in these my room just hit negative temperatures oh god **, 
  do you , for example , consider zimbabwean democracy the same exact as portuguese and french democracy ? 
  edit :  i 'm sorry i forgot about the petty monarchs , dukes and dames filling your yellowpress no need to get offensive , i for one do n't really ever read yellow press , but i still find our royal family a very important cultural and historical token of our country . 
  ** dude ** there 's this epic one from the french parliament that me and my classmates in france still sing to this day : [ c'est pas de votre faute ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prpxyzwj33a ), 
  well , i think you 're partially right on france : it 's true that there 's need for uniformity , there 's basically * one * french set of rules and it 's to be followed ( social norms and values like women 's equality for example ) . 
  however i think that race is n't the problem , the * real * deal is behavior . 
  my black friend in france is fully french , and so are her parents , there 's never really been a problem with them as they all act like the rest of french people ... and then there 's the ghettos where you find minorities that * do n't * , and often at times those are racial minorities . 
  so for me it 's a question about personal behavior and acceptance of `` frenchness '' rather than just skin color ( plus , i 'm from portugal and in france i was considered white , but my paler algerian friend was not , race is hard to define ) . 
  you can !, 
  and i think there 's even a polish embassy that still exists today over there ( not sure ) . 
  it 's expensive as all hell , but from what i 've heard it 's extremely weird ( in a good way ) experience to face this very closed fully socialist dictatorship , and see what the hell is in there , it feels like going back to the 70s ussr . 
  okay so spain , belgium , the uk , sweden , denmark , the netherlands , australia , new zealand , and luxembourg are n't democracies ? 
  democracy is n't black and white ya know ? 
  there 's very different shades of democracy for different countries . 
  ** ohdaaaah ** i want someone to do a trap remix of this . 
  no , no , no my dear , german must go like this : ** ordnung muss sein !, 
  i think you 're right in all points , i think it 's an interesting topic as well , plus what would this mean for the uk ? 
  i 'm all for keeping scotland in to prevent disruption and all the unneeded crap that would happen otherwise . 
  but i still want to make certain on what exactly keeping scotland in means , do they keep the same exact place as the uk ? 
  do they get * some * of the opt-outs ? 
  plus , from what i hear their economy is in deficit within the uk , so would scotland be economically sane and profitable ? 
  very true , and i do n't think we need even more countries that do n't fulfill criteria . 
  also , was n't the euro only enforced for ascencion in 2009 ? 
  both joined in 2007 so i 'm not at all sure how that works for them . 
  for me , i mainly have questions about scotland 's place in the eu as it would secede from a state that had * many * opt-outs and special arrangements ( like the rebate ) and i 'm not sure how to approach an independent scotland nor what it would look like economically . 
  i 'm not sure it would be that seamless . 
  scotland is n't the uk so how/why should it keep the uk 's opt-outs ? 
  i do n't know what would happen in 2014 if scotland were independent ( would they need to reapply ? 
  would they be kept ? 
  would they keep the uk 's opt-outs ? ), 
  so now with brexit i 'm even more uncertain . 
  i think it would be awesome to have an independent ( and economically sane ) scotland with is in the eu , but i 'm not sure it 's so simple to do so . 
  imho it would be wrong for us to exclude smaller languages should we have one commissioned , who are we to say that some languages matter more than others ? 
  that 's not at all what the eu should be about . 
  instead we use an die freude in its universal translation : music . 
  as music is something that every person in the continent can relate to and can recognise at ease . 
  plus , an die freude for me is specially as it truly envoices joy and `` gezellig '' ( a sense of `` togetherness '' sorta like the danish `` hygge '' ) . 
  really ? 
  i personally love the way it looks in lisbon , mainly because lisbon has a very weird characteristic to it : we randomly have very modern new buildings mixed with very classic older infrastructure ; and that dissonance and contrast in styles for me * if done correctly ( not like north korea 's cities ) * is very interesting to see and it feels like you 're constantly seeing something new . 
  what * my * teacher told me is that it looked like that because salazar ordered it to look like the sf-oakland bridge to basically `` show the world we 're mighty as fuck '' i have my serious doubts about it , she said tonnes of stuff that were untrue back in the days of old . 
  i personally very much like the anthem , and feel like it 's connected to the eu . 
  what would you propose as an eu anthem instead ? 
  there are several arguments that go against it right now , mainly because the last one was * very * recent and did n't pass , plus people really speculate that * if * there 's a new referendum then it 'll be after brexit ( so we know what 's what with the uk and such ) . 
  for me , personally , scotland should definitely wait until after the dust settles to see what its position in the world will be * and * to also see if an independent scotland can join the eu ( requirements have gravely changed , now you * must * be schengen and accept to join the eurozone eventually for example ), 
  better yet , the sweet escape by gwen stefani , the lyrics are quite appropriate :  if i could escape  i would , but first of all let me say  i must apologize for acting , stinking , treating you this way  cause i 've been acting like sour milk that fell on the floor  it 's your fault you did n't shut the refrigerator  maybe that 's the reason i 've been acting so cold  if i could escape  and recreate a place as my own world  and i could be your favorite girl  forever , perfectly together  tell me , boy , now would n't that be sweet ? 
   if i could be sweet  i know i 've been a real bad girl  i did n't mean for you to get hurt  ( forever ) we can make it better  tell me , boy , now would n't that be sweet ? 
   ( sweet escape ), 
  at first i was a bit `` oh hell naw '' to the guy who made them shut up , but as much as i love the gesture , it 's true that he definitely had a very fair point . 
  cute gesture from them , i appreciate it !,
