  as a tuga in the netherlands , they love us back apparently . 
  * peroxide is maaagiiic , smell the chemicaaals *, 
  calm down montesquieu, 
  for me , learning about its inner workings , made me realise that the eu is n't really anything by itself , the member states themselves are in basically full control of it , so if it 's undemocratic to , let 's say the netherlands ( because we do n't choose our commissioner , he 's instead appointed ) then for me that 's our fault rather than fully the eu 's . 
  it 's still interesting to know just `` who '' the eu is for me , because it somewhat makes it feel like the eu is just a system that needs inputs , and its inputs are always from the member states no matter what we do , thus generating the question : is the eu undemocratic , or are member states undemocratic * regarding * the eu ? 
  you were the one who * still * has n't adressed it after calling the eu undemocratic even though it clearly is elected ... you also * elected * cameron but * did n't * elect theresa , so now we 're all still waiting for a50 , meanwhile it 's been repeated there 's a way faster track way aside from a50 to leave the eu : revoke the european communities act of 1972 and you are ** out ** . 
  this so far has n't really been a smooth road considering may even tried to get it through without passing it through * parliament * and it took a higher court ruling to force it to go usual proceedure ... * it 's as if britain has n't had a say since the referendum * if you wan na leave then by all means leave , but pretend that the eu is undemocratic whereas the uk has n't been democratic ever since the results came out is just bullshit . 
  have a good night , and to be honest this was fun ( and informative ) , so thanks for the chat . 
  he still called the eu unelected , which was proven time and time again to be an outright lie . 
  i do n't really care for farage , the man has n't been in charge of much but * ukip * and that , in my books , is as much as being the leader of the english defense league ... also , 25 years gunning for the man ? 
  if the eu was gunning for him he would n't be allowed into parliament * and yet there he is * so it sounds more like a whiny `` oh but they were meeeaaan ! '', 
  british outcry than a constructive `` i disagree with the eu 's stances and policies , therefore i believe that right now it 's best we leave '' with far stronger arguments than `` we 're opening the door to 30 million bulgarians and romanians ! '' . 
  if brexit is so great then howcome the uk is * still * in the eu and we 're all * still * waiting for article 50 and nigel farage is * still * in the `` oh so oppressive '' european parliament ? 
  ** just leave **, 
  ** american refugees welcome ** / s, 
   '' [ ... ] belgium , which is pretty much a non-country '' belgium is a non-country if whatever farage says is true ... 
  my best guess is that we live in an age that being a celebrity grants you political leeway ... trump * did * get elected , so honestly i 'm not really * that * surprised, 
  i would actually require a * lot * more documents and a * lot * more money to have been able to do half the shit i 've done actually , plus how would me having a passport would bring my country the stability it needed after our dictatorship ? 
  we 'd be * far * worse of if it were n't for the eu . 
  [ this comes to mind ] ( http://static0.hln.be/static/photo/2016/4/9/13/20160624131056/media_xll_8805193.jpg ), 
  well , in my experience the eu bought me by providing me with better education , a safer political situation for my country , freedom to fully explore this beautiful continent and even meet the best people i 've met so far . 
  the eu opened me doors , and allowed me to build my own life as i see fit , it even allowed for my family to no longer be divided among countries and finally be able to freely move around and enjoy each other 's company . 
  no , the * member states * are set that way , the eu is merely doing what it does with the input each member state gives it ... 
  if the eu were to * force * member states to uphold those inputs to democratic approval , then that would definitely be crossing its boundries and not at all respecting each member 's sovereignty . 
  nigel farage * quit * right after brexit and had to constantly lie during the campaign to get a 2 % majority on a non-binding referendum . 
  nigel has n't done much at all for the uk considering what a stupid image it gave the uk whilst bullshitting its way in parliament , blatantly lying not only in there but to the british people themselves and enticing countless times intolerance as well . 
  so the uk 's fault is somehow proof that * the eu * is undemocratic ? 
  these are some mental gymnastics ... 
  [ this says otherwise ] ( http://www.europarl.org.uk/en/your-meps/what_do_they_do.html ) , `` meps have the power to approve , amend or reject nearly all eu legislation . '', 
  it 's also [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_of_the_european_parliament ) as well ... 
  so you wan na vote for who represents your own country at the commission ? 
  then how is that the commission 's problem considering that power is the member state 's to appoint its own ? 
  if the uk did n't let you vote for the uk commissionner , that 's the uk 's fault , it 's up to each member state to form its own process of selection , just like meps ... 
  although it 's complicated at first to understand it , i think that with the appropriate teaching or even just a bit of research , europeans would benefit a * lot * from knowing who does what when and why . 
  so basically , these * elected * meps have the power to approve amend or reject nearly all eu legislation ... 
  but obviously they do n't do anything oh at all , it 's not like there 's going to be free roaming in a few months , nor like there 's eu laws protecting customers from malicious business practices ... 
  the european commission is made up of people * chosen by each member state * . 
  if you think that the uk 's representation is shitty for example , blame the uk for choosing their commissioner . 
  furthermore , commissioners are n't supposed to represent solely their country 's interests but think about * all * the eu . 
  so the eu which has * elected * meps to approve/disapprove/amend laws proposed by a commission of people * appointed by the member states * to seek for the greater good of the eu is undemocratic . 
  keep going . 
  google is your friend though :  meps have the power to approve , amend or reject nearly all eu legislation . 
  they hold the european commission to account and can force it to resign . 
  the european parliament also decides on the eu budget and influences how eu money is spent . 
  ** i 'd do that for free , they 'd be the best videos , they 're gon na be great , hyuuuuje full-lenght films , absolutely amazing , bigly . 
  hehehehe . 
  well , good on you i guess . 
  yet if you 'd check my flair 's text you 'd notice i 'm actually half portuguese half french . 
  also , eu election ? 
  i thought the eu was undemocratic , did you suddenly change your mind ? 
  it 's about 5 degrees colder in this shade . 
  there 's a small protest being organised in amsterdam this monday , and my romanian friend ( who i wan na join over there ) got me a sign that says `` alt\u0103 \u00eentrebare '' but the bare are prison bars . 
  ... so we come twice ? 
  just an ex-part of it called the uk . 
  the eu so far is still running pretty well for everyone else , and hell , we 're all getting free roaming for all eu countries in july !, 
  so things are maybe even getting * better *, 
  it does n't really change my argument that the two are by far the biggest , leaving far less room for everyone else . 
  also , why did you need separate comments for this ? 
  72.2 % is the biggest turnout ? 
  that 's just sad to me . 
   and no caps but how am i supposed to play fallout then !? 
  i do n't think he means there are n't any , but he 's just asking for a more defined explanation of what it actually means . 
  okay so it 's no longer * just * a joke ? 
  i could talk about the uk 's role in multiple anti-democratic conflicts and processes , plus how the uk got more opt-outs from the eu than any other state * and is leaving * yet still continuously bitches about it . 
  are we going to gloss over how nobody voted for theresa may ? 
  in my country , the people choose their leaders , and it 's pretty much that simple , you vote for what you feel is best , and you have * plenty * of choices ( as opposed to the uk where it 's basically tories vs labor with everything else being irrelevant ) . 
  the eu even contributed to bring a stable democratic state to my country after our revolution in 1983 , and it was fruitful as it stopped times of political coups and turnmoil . 
  meanwhile , the uk did n't help us that much , and even pretty much shat on our own sovereignty in 2007 , and keeps on moaning for about 6 months now over the eu ( which was pretty unprecedented before the brexit vote , funny how attitudes suddenly spark up like that ) . 
  the eu has cared about bringing stable democracy and political stability more than a * lot * of other organisations have . 
  plus , do you think the eu is just controlled by evil eu people ? 
  it 's basically controlled by its member states , everyone 's in charge ... also , that `` sect '' is also elected , it 's representative of every country ( including yours until you * finally * leave us ) from my perspective in the uk i see a referendum that made everyone admit to horrid lies during campaigning , a very small margin ( plus a small turnout considering the impact of the decision ) and a totally unelected leader that brought a few clowns with her like bojo or a guy who once thought that * all * of ireland was still in the uk . 
  talk about what you will , but pretending the eu does n't care about democracy is like saying the dutch do n't like biking . 
  i think we should talk about us politics * but only * when it actually involves us more directly . 
  you 're right on saying that this reddit is unfortunately sorta talking about it too much recently , some stuff about trump does n't really include europe at all but it still ends up here sometimes . 
  so * not * the union jack , got it . 
  have fun with theresa . 
  ... * whispers 7-1 *, 
  small translation for non-russian speakers : `` white house : the us will not soften the sanctions against the fsb , and clarified their action '', 
  * this is the end * * hold your breath and coooouunt to ten *, 
  i really wan na travel to countries that i do n't know much of in the eu , because i always feel more connected and familiar with the place afterwards , especially when i already know some people there . 
  i feel very connected to germany because i 've been there and have friends , * slovakia is definitely on my list tho my homeboi dubcek is there * ( funny university story ), 
  *** wall ***, 
  ** ** this is a y\u00dcjj discrimination **, 
  * sings eurovision songs in even worse latvian *, 
  * provides live translations *, 
  i wish we could just put up more flags , because i feel like that would be better ; i feel european but i do n't feel in the least slovak or hungarian , since i do n't know much about those places , thus my opinion would be more uhm `` lusofrancodutch '' than * entirely * european as in everything at once , i think . 
  i prefer using the flag of the country i am , and we have n't federalized ** yet ** ^ in ^ diversitate ^ concordia, 
  * looks into the distance , accepting the horrors and tragedies of the future *, 
  i seriously hope portugal does , our country is unfortunately facing a lot of corruption too and if this shit would pass in there i 'd want the same . 
  we 're with you romania , hang in there !, 
  lel , top bait , much shit post . 
  he says `` you do n't understand '' so what the fuck is his explanation then ? 
  is he gon na pull that `` being a politician in romania is more dangerous than being a soldier in afghanistan '' bullshit ? 
  i dare him . 
  [ ** nobody posted this and i 'm saying shame on all you for not doing this ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz7vkmuntpa ), 
  you do n't need contact with other people either in my opinion . 
  i used to be really shy , and then i started travelling by myself to places like berlin , and enjoying myself even alone , slowly i became more and more happy and that 's something that naturally attracts people to you . 
  so take your id card , catch the next plane to wherever you fancy , and have a nice time , even if you 're alone it does n't matter you do n't need anyone to be happy . 
  ** treat .
