  very , very true , my best friends have always been made while travelling !, 
  you do n't need friends to roam with , go by yourself !, 
  explore europe !, 
  you 're a strong , independent , euro redditor , who do n't need no friends . 
  no but seriously just roam by yourself , it 's super fun ( and for me personally , sometimes better than with friends or family ), 
  i am just superstitious when it 's fun to be , sorta to take the piss . 
  i 've always been told that in lisbon , even in kindergarten my teachers told me that once or twice ... 
  i 'm not even * remotely * hungarian but jesus christ mary and joseph ** what the actual fuck ? 
  ** i 'm shook . 
  same in portugal !, 
  holy crap i thought we were the only ones !, 
  yes , i agree , and i think it 's important that we do n't tell women how to dress and that instead we should take action against pressures and restriction on personal freedoms and choices . 
  i do n't really know much about how christian churches deal with nuns abandoning their convicts , but i 'd assume you 're correct , i doubt it 's an actual problem ; and for islam i think you 're right as well as we hear countless stories of all sorts of people being forced into it ; which should never happen in europe at all . 
  yes , th\u00e9t 's exactly still the problem with a lot of women and even young girls today , i believe that 's disgusting to be forced into a lifestyle that is n't by your own choice and that right there should be cracked up and fought against . 
  women , * if they personally choose to * should feel free to wear or not to wear a hijab , and should n't have to face any backlash for it if she meets this * one * legal standard of not covering her face in public . 
  i love stuff like this , although i do n't understand little pieces of it , like what the hell were they doing with their hands ? 
  like , making their fingertips touch ... wtf ? 
  also , i 'd imagine the dude who appears to the right of the politician whom got evicted from the chamber is calling schulz a nazi ... but ... 
  is n't golden dawn literally just a closeted neo-nazi political party anywas ? 
  and what in the everliving name of jesus mary and joseph do the hungarians in the background have to do with these ? 
  i personally applaud schulz here , he not only applied the clear written rules with very transparent justification for his action , but he also remained calm and resolute even whilst being shouted at by politicians that seem far too keen on pointing fingers than following rules . 
  i 'd love it if you could , i 've yet to properly do research on the german election so far ( bit worried about the dutch and the french one firstly ), 
  what 's bad about the spd ? 
  i dunno who `` them '' are , because not all muslims even wear that , my friend never did and she even explained that she read that quran and the actual phrase that states that women should cover themselves is actually pretty disputed and sounds far more like `` be modest about yourselves '' than `` cover up your whole damn body or so damn help me . '', 
  i think it 's perfectly fine as long as it 's a woman 's * personal * choice , women are free to use whatever they please . 
  i do see it as being uncomfortable , but so are corsets and god knows i 'd use the * fuck * out of one . 
  i propose a small collection of haikus and beautifully embroided tapestry for the sultan to be added to it . 
  i had no idea , and yes i can definitely see that being quite controversial , especially his stance on refugees ( seriously , do n't feet geert , he 's loud enough as is ) . 
  wait hold the phone he said that ? 
  this seems like a step forward to be honest ; covering your face up does not at all seem like it would belong in a modern european country in the least and it could even become a security risk if we ca n't see who 's underneath . 
  that being said i 'm also glad that they did n't ban headscarves , because for me those are actually fine , they are also very much used in fashion and during winter they 're a nice way to keep warm . 
  this seems like a good middle : show your face in public , feel free to wear a headscarf , but if you 're a government official , you 're religiously * neutral * . 
  good on you austria !, 
  ** g\u00d6tterfunken intensifies **, 
  really ? 
  i must admit i have n't heard much about him , but he seems pretty good . 
  so what 's controversial ? 
  and most importantly : what 's the * bad * side ? 
  you need a $ - snap , albeit more complicated it 's totally worth it . 
  til how to say `` freedom '' in ukrainian . 
  never , ever read the youtube section , do n't do that to yourself . 
  i 'd probably be the dude who would hit that dude up afterwards with my number because he 's * cuuute *, 
  hold the phone really ? 
  damn son , that 's some brilliant design, 
  there 's no chance in hell i 'd be able to draw this by memory . 
  i know , and i still prefer the `` large form '' over what 's on the flag . 
  for me it would be interesting to see a new ident for portugal , whenever i see our national symbols i 'm a bit reminded of salazar , and i 'm pretty sure we 're far past that . 
  ukraine and slovenia have ** gorgeous ** ones to me . 
  i love how simple but still imageful they are . 
  i am not too fond of the `` royal '' ones like denmark , sweden , the uk ... it 's overly complicated , though i like portugal 's a bit ( even if the plants are a bit too much ) ** bosnia and herzegovina did you bloody actually try ? 
  ** i volunteer as tribute **, 
  i was thinking about more general political affiliations with russia , but yeah i think that 'd be a dealbreaker for putin , specially since he can have lepen who fully recognizes it, 
  ah , fair enough . 
  thanks !, 
  is n't he pro-russia though ? 
  yeah , i was still a little bit impressed , apparently that 's a thing for a very tiny amount of people ... * the hunger games *, 
  i remember my romanian friend talking to me about how he went to this cemetery in bucharest once where sexy sexy nicolae was buried and he took pictures of people * still * mourning his death and such ... ceau\u015fescu sure did n't end well but let 's admit that his death was really damn good reality tv . 
  ** edrogan is infinite , edrogan is eternal ** / s, 
  shitty joke i made to my romanian friend : i gave him a euro and said `` you just got lei 'd 4 times ~ '', 
  ` ayyyy . 
  i 'm glad you like it over there , i 'm counting on visiting it soon , but all the opinions i 've ever heard came from polish people , so i was n't 100 % sure just exactly how reliable it would be . 
  ... actually that 's not a bad idea , now i actually wonder . 
  ** high pitched scream ** genuine question : how do you find poland as an outsider ? 
  i looked at your flare and was like `` wait , is that silesia 's flag ? 
  i could swear that was vietnam '' then i checked the text ... heh . 
  ** g\u00d6tterfunken set to overdrive **, 
  * i dunno man , there 's some pretty attractive non-europeans that can touch me *, 
  ** i swear i had a raven-moment and predicted this exact moment **, 
  i do n't , and that makes me sad ... you 're swedish , you guys win at eurovision all the time , have you got something ? 
  yeah it definitely has that enlightenment vibe to it , you 're right . 
  i 'm still not sure if i see today 's europe in it . 
  i see europe as a very modern place , super connected , rich in culture and history , and strong as a push for further human development ( be it science , arts , etc. . . ), 
  is it weird that i do n't find this theme song really super european ? 
  i mean sure it always reminds me of some epic italian battle , but only because it 's an epic music with italian lyrics . 
  maybe boom chicka wow wow . 
  i did not know die tages presse , but goddamnit how did i live without this in my life . 
  they get downvotes because they are repetitive and often shite sources , it 's always the same banter of `` brexit is the devastation of british civilization ! '', 
  or `` brexit is the salvation of british civilization ! '', 
  while also ignoring how extremely tired of hearing it most europeans ( non uk , but considering how every british person i know is doing , even here in the netherlands , i 'd say a fair amount of them of uk ones as well ) are sick and tired of hearing about it . 
  europe is more than brexit , and brexit is * still * yet to happen . 
  so go post whatever you want but saying that * we 're * clingy when you 're the one spamming us , bitch please , close the door behind you #bye, 
  well , there 's far more to the uk than just brexit , and yet there 's still a very substantial amount of it in your feed , plus , you say that this sub is obsessed with the uk , while posting about the uk ... that 's like saying that your child is obese as you take them to mcdonald 's for the 3rd time in 2 days, 
  soooo if someone attacks the representatives , nobody cares , but fuck my rugs or my paintings , or spill wine on my couch , and then we have a problem ? 
  if the * building * is the main concern ... she does , and she constantly has , specially because this is n't a visit , this is a public appearance . 
  visiting obviously is just her walking around and such , not doing much , but a public appearance with the media all over the place and her needing to be fully ready for that sort of thing ? 
  yeah , it 's pretty risqu\u00e9 not to have additional security . 
  and still having their partner ( uk ) spam her phone with brexit-related content every now and then . 
  judging by your post history , you seem pretty clingy to brexit as well ... 
  they are still protected , and rightfully so . 
  the house of representatives only needs protection because * it 's the house of representatives * and guess what , they are part of it . 
  she needs additional security to visit any place , including that one , however she failed to warn them she was coming so no security measures could have been prepared ... 
  so you 're saying that buma and roemer are not at all protected ? 
  better call up buma and tell him to stop going to the house of representatives since obviously there 's absolutely no security ...  which is a completely different situation then securing someones home or supermarket . 
  it 's a public appearance , it requires protection , and the fact is they were not prepared at all since there was no former warning she was coming at all , so obviously , for security reasons , she 'd have to be refused . 
  yes , and she * does * need extra protection all the time , all you need to do is look at her house . 
  and yes , all politicians need extra protection , some need protection more than others , or do politicians just never get attacked or anything ? 
  look at , for example , the bundestag , where a * lot * of politicians are present and so are a lot of regular people visiting , it 's very highly secure because those people sitting there are a constant target no matter who they are . 
  it 's * marine lepen * though , she 's definitely in need of protection all the time , even her house is very much secure to guarantee her safety . 
  she probably needs extra security if she 'd ever go grocery shopping at auchan ... 
  if she just showed up to the camp and requested entry , obviously they could not prepare safety precautions to make sure she remains as safe , and so she was refused .
