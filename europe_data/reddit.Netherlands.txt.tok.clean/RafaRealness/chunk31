  this is like knowing you ca n't walk yet request to hike up a mountain , and then get pissed when they refuse to provide a wheel chair that they do n't have . 
  politicians announce in advance when they do these sorts of stunts , or do n't and expect this precise reaction to cause even more inflammation all around . 
  since when is a person who so far has never won an election the embodiment of france ? 
  hell , ask louis xiv how `` la france c'est moi '' turned out for him ... 
  i said additional * for lepen * she could have gone to the eiffel tower , or go shopping at les champs elys\u00e9es , she 'd still need protection that is n't * just * available on demand , she 's a high-ranking person and a lot of enemies , so it 's important she 's safe . 
  not really what i said , i said that * politicians * need extra protection all the time , and that 's a common fact for not only lepen but for any politician at all . 
  if they were not ready to secure her fully , because as a politician in a public appearance i 'd imagine she 'd * definitely * need to be secure , then i believe it was a good call to refuse her entry to begin with . 
  good question actually , but i 'd imagine it would be more for security reasons . 
  she * does * have a lot of enemies , and i 'd imagine she 's like any other politician and needs protection while going out so publicly, 
  ** this made my absolute day god damnit **, 
  i ca n't stop laughing at that meme that goes : trump : this is gon na be a great 8 years biden : ** 8 years !? 
  ** obama : biden , please ... biden : ** oh hell no he is about to catch these hands bruh **, 
  with the best words ^ tm russia making mexico pay for their signs did n't work out eseeeeee . 
  * i have no idea what you 're talking about , sweetie *, 
  true , have n't considered that actually , also , is it just me or do wenot talk a lot about asean ? 
  like , forreal , it seemed like it would be more important than it actually ended up being , weird . 
  well , anyone can have an opinion , to be honest . 
  ... for japan 's safety let 's never ever allow that holy titties . 
  i 'm pretty open to the idea of having non-european cultures be accepted into the european project should they want to be an active part of it , or should we kick the basques out ? 
  also , malta is technically in africa and their language is closer to arabic so ... bye malta too ? 
  and you just generalized western europe , what the actual ... 
  it was * one * joke , and i 'm about to sign off on this because seriously it 's not worth my time : be mindful of what you say and how you say it and do n't bitch at others for being snobbish and ignorant whilst you do * the exact same thing *, 
  for me it seemed like a joke , and again , i still believe that letting them in does n't mean they do n't have a completely different culture and history , because is n't our motto literally `` unity in diversity '' ? 
  it just sounds like you * want * to be offended and shout at people rather than really be constructive about it , because by that comment alone you 're generalizing all of europe itself and let 's be honest , portugal and estonia have little to nothing in common , yet we very happily live under the same roof . 
  so basically you 're gsaying that we ca n't joke about it ? 
  also , what 's wrong with * letting * them in ? 
  considering that it 's more like an invitation rather than a `` join now or despair '' situation ... 
  i 'm pretty sure the japanese people care extremely little for this if at all , so there 's no real need for * you * to speak on their behalf and insult others claiming they are acting naively and snobbishly . 
  really ? 
  how come ? 
  i thought they did a pretty good job at it . 
  jesus , can you maybe chill ? 
  also , are n't * you * insulting them by speaking on their behalf ? 
  they are grown and educated , they can stand up for themselves if they need to . 
  hence the problem : c, 
  what started out as a pure joke is slowly turning into an actually good idea ... actually i do n't see a lot of cons to letting japan into the eu , aside from having to rename the eu to like , eurasian union or something . 
  will do !, 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  thanks for explaining !, 
  i live in the supposedly really bad part of amsterdam and honestly it 's not at all bad , but i definitely agree on what you said about amsterdam , it 's definitely not as gezellig as other places ( really got ta go to the hague , i 'm only comparing it to utrecht right now ) i actually was planning on originally moving to the hague , but yeah , education comes first for me , i 'll go there regardless though , got ta hit up the embassy ( and also madurodam is bae ) thanks for talking about it !, 
  now i 'm even more excited to get over there . 
  like he 's saying `` bitch the fuck where are your parents '', 
  the uk : the matrioska of nationalities , where the british doll sometimes is bigger/smaller than the english/scottish/welsh doll, 
  ** varietate concordia-desu **, 
  makes sense , thanks for the clarification !, 
  why not , instead , calmly explain it instead of rambling on about it like i spat on willem 's face while kicking beatrix ? 
  if it 's not a problem then it 's not a problem , but the fact is that i hear quite a bit from that city , both good things ( like the beautiful architecture , amazing shopping , great beaches etc. . ) as well as bad things ( hooligans , * that * triangle , `` cheap amsterdam '' , etc. . . ) i do believe there 's more to the story , i was literally just saying i 'm concerned about it , but not more concerned than , for example , what the gvb counts on doing with the noord-zuid line in amsterdam . 
  * let ... let them join the eu * ^ / s, 
  what about people from gibraltar ? 
  and the falklands ? 
  are they called british as well ? 
  oh , yeah , that makes sense . 
  i 'm mainly wondering about his identity , not in a social basis ( aristocratic vs poor ) but mainly about what exactly did people call ghandi nationality-wise , was he british ? 
  or indian ? 
  maybe something else ? 
  sorry , i do n't know a lot about indian culture and history . 
  i noticed , and i kinda feel sorry for them , life 's a lot harder if you ca n't speak dutch * at all * in the netherlands . 
  i think i 'm lucky i have dutch friends who explain and correct me though ( specially with stuff that is n't at all transparent , like what the heck `` op =op '' is supposed to mean or how `` waar '' can mean two very different things ), 
  i 'm jealous , forreal , those look absolutely amazing and gorgeous ... ** stop beating us at everything finland god fucking damnit **, 
  when you apply for dutch citizenship , and at the inauguration you get ( nothing fancy , but still a nice touch in my opinion ) you must say * either * `` so help me god almighty '' * or * `` i declare and promise that '' if you are n't religious . 
  so gandhi was not considered anything ? 
  like , it does n't say british , nor even indian ( sorry , i 'm not fully sure what middle temple means ), 
  yeah exactly , though the usual choice is to portray them as a regular white dude . 
  i personally just thought it was a little bit interesting that for once it was n't adopted ( or maybe it was and he 's just straining his face really hard while warming up his muscles , it 's a caricature after all ), 
  i 'm genuinely curious , is it just me who sees it ? 
  actually , from my experience ( at least in amsterdam ) it 's harder to connect with locals without speaking to them in dutch since they very often just disregard me as a tourist rather than an actual inhabitant here . 
  i 'm planning on actually staying here and settling , i specifically chose to study in the netherlands so that i could firstly see if i really like it here and secondly to give me time to adapt first ( learn dutch , get used to the social norms , etc. . . ) so let 's say i 'm counting on staying here for a very , very long time xd, 
  i 'm not sure how i feel about the hague because my friends from utrecht and my lecturers here think it 's just boring and `` basically a cheap amsterdam '' . 
  plus there 's one thing over there that i do n't know exactly just how serious it is but genuinely seems a bit concerning to say the least : the jihad triangle, 
  what does england say when they * really * do n't want to recognize someone as their own ? 
  do they say `` british '' to make everyone else share the guilt ? 
  northern ireland where are you ? 
  ... i lived in paris before omg xd do n't say berlin next , please . 
  i 'm actually more interested in utrecht and the hague ( specially utrecht ) since they are way quieter and not as `` messy '' as amsterdam . 
  helaas i study here so i 'll just see if i can move there once i finish my studies . 
  ok that genuinely made me giggle , +1 to you good sir . 
  edit : is it just me or does the us look really asian ? 
  like , a chinese top model kinda face, 
  i live here . 
  i was just there yesterday night , i was looking for nemo ( eventually found it ), 
  just recently bojo called the french president a nazi . 
  what 's being hostile to you ? 
   do you feel european ? 
  hell yeah i do !, 
   when did you realize that you are part of the european family ? 
  when i moved to france , and i started to learn more about europe in general , and realising that maybe i have something in common with more than just my own country 's people  what kind of situation make you proud of being european ? 
  i love travelling and meeting other europeans , getting to know what they think of europe itself , and what life is like for them  what is europe ( the continent ) for you ? 
  i think of it as one giant house , and we are all locked inside . 
  every country 's got its own room and the eu is basically just us tearing down walls so that we can all have a better , bigger room with each other , and then non-eu countries are just next door and are important , and always within reach ( some more than others , norway is infinitely more reachable than belarus in my opinion ) . 
  `` these elitist pilots have lost touch with regular passengers like us !, 
  raise your hand if you think ** i ** should fly the plane ! '', 
  i believe that if * both * sides are transparent about what exactly they want and what they are willing to offer , then this can all go far more smoothly since you 'd get the populations involved and neither side wants to be seen nor as a victim nor as a bully when it comes to the uk . 
  plus , that way we 'd be going far faster since we 'd cut the crap and get on with it instead of just haggling like desperate old merchants in zion or something . 
  i do n't believe that the rest of the continent wants the brits to suffer , and i do n't believe that the brits want us to suffer either . 
   personally i think the whole claim that they 're now being treated badly is being blown up beyond all proportion . 
  i think so as well , but i did n't mean that part ( i 'm pretty sure that wo n't really change much ) i meant mainly relating to visas , working rights , studying in the uk etc. . .  i 'm fine with that , ireland did n't give a shit when it did it for apple , google etc. 
  well , for me that can be extremely detrimental as i really believe that it 's both in the uk 's and the eu 's best interest to keep good relationships , and it 's no secret the eu hates those ( yet allows the netherlands to get away with it )  personally i think she should n't have announced anything . 
  i believe that if we had fully transparent and clear negotiations , it would be more beneficial , and still i believe she has n't really announced that much at all aside from `` we 've opted for the hard brexit option '', 
  yes , after months we 've got a speech with details on what exactly brexit really is : leaving the common market , hope for a deal with europe but if not then it 's back to wto rules . 
  it still seems like a precarious situation in my opinion for the uk , as it does not at all mention what for me are very important questions , like how will eu citizens living in the uk be treated if all goes well ?
