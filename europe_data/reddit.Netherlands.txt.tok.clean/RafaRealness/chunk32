  and is the uk at risk of turning into a tax haven ? 
  plus this still does not at all answer my biggest concern : what will happen to ireland ? 
  it 's in nobody 's interest to see a reiteration of past tensions over there ... 
  i still do n't really trust may to follow through , it took her * this * long to merely announce exactly what the plan is to the british public , so how long until she actually does any of it ? 
  plus , what will mps and peers vote ? 
  i want brexit to go as painless and as best as possible for both sides , but i genuinely believe that the uk deserves way better leadership and guidance than what they got stuck with since cameron quit . 
  that 's exactly the thing : you 're still in the eu and yet somehow brexit is great ? 
  so far all we saw was the uk government scramble with resignations and entirely crap speeches that inform absolutely nobody aside from the usual `` brexit means brexit '' and `` red , white and blue brexit '' . 
  brexit so far is just a stress test for the media and for politicians to see just how much bullshit they can fill in before the people get pressed for answers , and it does n't help that it gives an extremely shaky and flaky imagery of the uk : you vote for a without knowing what a entrails and then keep boasting about a being a success without doing anything . 
  the uk is in limbo right now , it 's inside the eu and it 's on its way out ( probably ? ), 
  and nobody knows what `` out '' means so if that 's what you call `` steady '' then sure , by all means , but it 's not at all `` steady '' when nobody knows what the uk will be 3 years from now . 
  steady ? 
  how ? 
  it 's a huge political shitshow that makes the rest of the continent eyeroll so hard it 's audible . 
  not quite that steady , unfortunately, 
  ** we will move poland to switch places with the great country of san escobar **, 
  i 'm pretty sure this goes into r/askeurope rather than here to be honest . 
  well , i personally do n't really like picasso 's work that much but ... what ? 
  i really really want a politician to make that promise and see just how many idiots will believe it . 
  not just the uk , i seriously want , like , a polish candidate to be like `` make poland switch places with germany * physically * '' and see what happens, 
  ... goddamnit that one got me good . 
  what joke ? 
  because it 's one binary question without much to it . 
  you can pretty much google it ... 
  read r/europe 's rules :  text posts : we only allow text posts that are informative , well-researched , and stimulate healthy discussion . 
  please use / r/askeurope for simple questions . 
  i 'm pretty sure you meant to post this to r/askeurope ... 
  yeah , it is , and honestly the sole sense i make of it is that she 's just gon na ban every other color from the uk ( including the evil darker shade of blue from the european reich ) and reestablish british values like painting the streeets to match the union jack and dip your children in red paint . 
  well , when we read her memo ; it 's horrible how i feel nobody expected it to be anything else ...  red white and blue brexit ( bri'in is the new ` murikuh ? ), 
   have cake and eat it, 
  i came here for the drama , disappointed it has n't started yet ... 
  couple more minutes ? 
  wait , how do we count the ussr ? 
  because i 'm not sure ... 7 out of the 15 former soviet republics are in the `` europe '' category so does that mean that north korea , since it was briefly under soviet control after japanese colonisation ended after ww2 , was thus controlled by europe ? 
  not all of the ussr * was * in europe though , central asia is n't ( except that tiniest teeny tiny edge of kazakhstan ) edit : and how are we counting countries that previously existed but do n't anymore ? 
  out of curiosity : how often is this question actually brought up over there ? 
  and are there lots of people who cross the border very often ? 
  ** at least we have a word for 90 , or , as you say in french 20x4 +10 **, 
  i think you clearly mean f\u00e9ck !, 
  belgium is playing the dangerous game of `` how many subnations fit in my ___ '', 
  ... what about the german-speakers ? 
  and brussels ? 
  visit belgium : a country-matrioska,

  i meant the district compared to the rest of it ( the city seems to be okay , if sometimes noticeably poorer and less developed than , like , oeiras ) , specially the super minuscule villages where basically you need to wake up at 6 am to take the * one * bus that goes to the city in order to buy stuff from lidl ( no joke , that 's how my grandma rolled before she bought a car ), 
  very true , these developlment inequalities are often linked to these issues . 
  i 've never been to tras-os-montes but my dad who knows some people from there says it 's not much different from the most rural parts of bragan\u00e7a , aside from the accent . 
  exactly , i think it 's very common also in bragan\u00e7a ( where nearly all of my family is from ) and it 's predominantly the region most present in france according to some statistics a few years ago . 
  i remember going back to bragan\u00e7a and people genuinely still are in that closed-off mindset of `` portugal is great , but immigrants ruin it , must krush '', 
  ** sweet goddamn jesus ** yeah no wonder you hate these traditions these are just incredibly stupid , what kind of american tv jock-filled university is that ??? 
  here in amsterdam , everything is pretty chill aside from some very small groups that at the start of the year just run through random streets yelling ... that 's as harmful as it gets as far as i 've heard . 
  i think this swedish thing is a bit fun and mostly harmless as well , but ** what in the everliving hell is wrong with the people you just described **, 
  i honestly have no idea , he basically sees france as the best goddamn country in the world being destroyed by * all * immigrants ( except the portuguese ones who are great somehow ) and the rest of europe is poor , dangerous , and basically africa but worse because they `` get to come here and steal our jobs '' i see europe as multiple nations that all can live together ; like as if europe is a russian doll : continent-country-nation-etc ... 
  it just keeps getting deeper and deeper but in my opinion we should have the eu ( and fix it ) and truly push forward with the project . 
  ... well yeah no that actually fully explains it . 
  i really miss that bridge , and the vasco da gama bridge in lisbon ... no idea why but just driving through them while chatting with my parents is something i really miss doing at times . 
  they are * very * bad with history ( they really could have sworn there were still two germanies ! ), 
  so i wanted to bring them some stuff and teach them a little about the world when i came back , and besides , i absolutely love that car it 's so adorable !, 
  you know what i think made me ( and a * lot * of people in my university ) much more interested in learning about the eu ? 
  travelling inside and * outside * the eu and really feeling the difference ; plus , getting to meet romanian , polish , and lithuanian people made me a * lot * less scared and open to eastern europe in general ( and i must admit i have a slight crush on czechia ) , so maybe just bringing people * actually * together and motivating them to travel will stop this `` oh but bwaah poorer countries in the eu ! '', 
  crap as well . 
  it actually says made in germany , but thanks to whoever made it i have n't been excited over a vacuum cleaner since ... yeah never . 
  i think that we should n't shut them up but show explicitly with better `` marketing '' for the european institutions ( which can include a * lot * of history ) . 
  i still remember how much it sucked to have to pay astronomical fees in australia and taiwan to talk to my parents after a plane crash near mine made all online radars shut down , but a year later being able to just randomly call them when i visited germany to ask them if they prefered a blue or a green trabant miniature ? 
  ** g\u00f6tterfunken intensifies **, 
  i live in a pretty big student accommodation , and the traditions in my university are usually extremely mild and personal ; like organising a contest to see who deserves to go on the annual trip or having a ____ - themed borrel every now and then ( as opposed to the regular weekly one ) . 
  i * did * notice a bunch of dudes in white shirts and formal black pants running far past our university buildings shouting something i could n't understand ( only recently have i started to understand dutch , so i could n't back then ) . 
  apparently * those * are the ones who annoy everyone , the fraternity dudes from other universities ( well , hogeschoolen ) . 
  i do wonder , what 's your experiences with students ? 
  what are their traditions over there ? 
  all i 've done is sing the dutch anthem at a borrel and have a debate over european unemployment ( boring to some but not to us , somehow ), 
  fun anecdote of mine : i have this relative ( who * really * hates me ) and he 's a worker in a movings company . 
  he was born in portugal and now is a french citizen ... only he does not see himself as an immigrant at all and is * extremely * against immigration from any country ( except portugal ... jesus christ ) . 
  he works very often all over the eu , spanning from portugal to poland ( never went any further just yet ) and yet he ** hates ** the euro ( without knowing why except `` i liked it better when we had our own money ! '' ), 
  and ** hates ** schengen ( no reason given ) and ** hates ** the eu ... reason why he hates me : after he rambled on and told us he was gon na vote for lepen , i reminded him that he was an immigrant ( and so was most of our family ) and ( and i quote ) `` once lepen gets rid of all the muslims , who exactly do you think she 'll want to get rid of next ? '', 
  since then he does n't talk to me anymore , good riddance , but it shows just how much some people ( as he 's not at all an isolated case in my experience ) just * hate * some elements ( like the eu or gay marriage , basically anything really ) without even knowing what it 's all about or how it actually works at all ... sidenote : thank you germany for producing very cool house products , haha ( no seriously my vacuum cleaner is the best thing ever ), 
  exactly , i think that if we really want the eu to be respected and known better than it is today , it definitely needs to be more proactive on communication and information . 
  a good website would definitely help , and could help debunk crucial myths about the eu ( like the usual `` the eu is powerless but it 's taken our sovereignty away '' paradox ) as well as open up for more * informed * dialog about it ( not just `` the eu is gon na collapse ! '', 
  or `` the eu is perfect ! '', 
  speeches ), 
  yeah i have them there and look at their story whenever i 'm on the metro or whatever else bores me ; often they have quite nifty things !, 
  i 'm a portuguese guy living in good ol' nederland ... did we just happen to switch places ? 
  what brings a dutchie to the south ? 
  it still does n't explain the overall outdated and often poorly designed website . 
  i think that the eu can benefit from a stronger identity presence ; not just flags here and there but actually better and more active websites and other forms of media . 
  this is something i often wonder about ; how in the fuck does the eu and all the european institutions have such poorly designed websites ? 
  i 'm sorry but i find the design often atrocious ; it 's as if it came out the early/mid 2000s, 
  it 's still amazing to know that even after * years * of research , details and new information still comes up over this . 
  good job on fuhrer , no , not that one , i mean armin . 
  yes and just so damn perfect on , like , a balance between fully wild and natural to fully sculpted ; it 's kept right at that spot where it 's super good looking but does n't look super modified and such . 
  man , whoever fixed her hair for this picture deserves a kudos , i 'm not getting over this as soon as i 'd like . 
  same , that looks amazing . 
  that sounds like a good idea as well , although i think that we should maybe give them automatic permanent residence visas * if * they already live here . 
  if they do not then they must apply for the standard one like everybody else . 
  well , yes , but i severely doubt this will ever generate a war at all . 
  it * is * a good point i often think goes way understated and forgotten though . 
  i feel like we should not go that way because then we 're basically letting uk citizens have the same rights as eu citizens without guaranteeing the uk will do the same for eu citizens . 
  what we should do is provide a fast-track citizenship to any uk citizens studying/working/retired in the eu if they have come or planned to do so ( in the case of students ) before the vote itself . 
  afterwards we should provide a very lax visa policy towards the uk for highly skilled workers and students , but not low skilled workers .
