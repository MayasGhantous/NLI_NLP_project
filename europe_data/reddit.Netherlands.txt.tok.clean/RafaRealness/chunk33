  edit : only * if * the uk really refuses to grant eu citizens the same rights as uk citizens, 
  i agree with that too , they ( for me at least ) wanted to be those `` saviours '' sort of people while disregarding how potentially the average citizen 's life can be affected by it , and even more dangerously , sometimes disregarding his concerns and opinions ; hence why i think that although i like the eu , it deeply needs to change as the current state of it is n't ideal . 
  * fashion week : riga *, 
  yes , exactly , extremism is what will always spoil the broth for everyone , and that 's why i think that populism * as it is being presented today * is in essence bad , since they are too extreme in nature whereas what we need is better resolute decisions based on reason and rationality , not just blatant 350 # million lies . 
  oh damn son , we 're in for a fun ride . 
  it 's not the entire country 's population , or do you think * anyone * can vote for this referendum ? 
  furthermore , the turnout was 32.28 % saying that 1 % is enough to say it 's a lot of people compared to 99 % is basically saying that if 12 people show up after you sent 12 000 invitations it 's a lot ... 
  it 's not it 's a horridly small tiny little population unrepresentative of basically anything ... 
  compared to even just the total of people who voted it 's not even a fourth of the quantity , it 's not a big representative quantity in the least . 
  you could argue that any number bigger than 2 is big because * plural *, 
  * ok * ** now ** * i 'm slightly intimidated *, 
  i 'm more of a europhile but i 'm not satisfied with the eu , i think it needs to change , like , * right now * . 
  and my country had a very populist leader once , and it was a horrid disaster for decades , so for me these movements are just echoes of that , extremism is just going to fuck us up no matter the - ism they choose . 
  yes i know , i was just commenting how the definition itself , once pushed to extremes like it unfortunately is being nowadays is actually dangerous . 
  wanting less privileges for a ruling elite is something i can get behind of , but the problem is the populists of today like farage are just extremist idiots . 
  [ ` fraid not ] ( http://rlv.zcache.com/im_a_frayed_knot_photo_print-r61d8c46ac5ea494d97d875221a603457_a0ib_8byvr_512.jpg ), 
  goddamnit i had to stop for a solid minute , groan , and google up the actual difference between czech and slovak and ... * now there 's also moravian in the mix apparently * as a concerned fellow eurodude : seriously do czechs consider slovak a language or a dialect ? 
  i thought that true & proud americans drank oil and ate bullet-spiced grilled steak with double deep fried fries ... * are you a spy !? 
  huh ? 
  i looked up the definitions of other - isms related to politics , and i think that a * lot * of them , if taken to the extreme , are just as dangerous ( if not more ) . 
  for me , populism is something that unfortunately is taken to extreme lenghts that search to just dismantle without really trying to find better ways . 
  if it were far more watered down , we 'd probably would n't be raving about it , but for now we have farage and lepen ... which honestly are n't the best people to represent * anything * at this point . 
  ** is that a whole military arsenal in your basement or are you just kinky ? 
  she sounds like quite a bit of a ripe cunt ... ah well , i 'm glad that now things are moving on and a positive outcome came out of it all . 
  possibly , yes . 
  i personally like the eu but i think that it * does * need to change , like , ** right now ** . 
  i also feel like populism is more destructive than properly constructive when i look at examples like wilders or lepen ; they want to dismantle and stop this and that , but not create something new , just basically yell `` i want change '' and then smash their furniture ... for change . 
  as a european , i 'm happy we can have free trade and movement while still striking our own deals , all the while being safer from russia . 
  if you want to feel the communism flow through your eyeballs , just take a look at present-day bijlmer : [ i swear to god ] ( https://www.failedarchitecture.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/01.02_dienst_stadsontwikkeling_adam_bijlmermeer_adam_1962-73-1010x400.jpg ) [ oh and those semi-detached houses you talked about are all over the place as well , haha ] ( https://failedarchitecture.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/era_f-buurt_bijlmermeer-640x410.jpg ), 
  out of curiosity : how did the owner act up ? 
  i see it too , but i have to ask : would n't populism ultimately be a threat to any government as well ? 
  the common people against the privileged elite ? 
  to me it sounds like you can take it that way as well ( by this definition ) . 
  yeah , and it 's too big to fit as nicely as the demarcation on the sidebar , considering that smaller states like macedonia and montenegro and others would be so smushed you could n't even see them . 
  plus , we 'd also have a useless portion of the map as in your example there are territories that are not european . 
  i still do n't get how you believe that * a map * can be biased against russia since it represents russia where it is ; furthermore if anything your map is even more biased as it does n't really leave space for smaller countries and russia takes basically half the whole map * and * it drags territories that are n't in europe into it . 
  the standardised use of the `` developable surface '' method for maps is there for a reason , and biases against russia is n't one of them , i still fail to see how * even though russia still has by far the biggest portion of the map * it 's still a bias against russia ... 
  * bless , i love it when countries ' people get really heated about these cultural things , it 's often so damn fun *, 
  also , jesus and judas kissed ... as a gay person even i 'd say that 's very very ** unchristian ** [ some nice fellowship from our ~ ~ colonies ~ ~ friends from across the ocean ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuavrcswu8i ), 
  ** wait a second , did n't jesus end up with two dads and a mom ? 
  ** ** something 's fishy here **, 
  752 819 people is a lot to you in a referendum where the turnout was ** 4 151 613 ** in a population with ** 12\u00a0862\u00a0658 ** eligible votes ( so 32.28 % ) if we take this and do some maths that means that 752 819 out of the 12\u00a0862\u00a0658 eligible votes is about 6 % of it all . 
  so you 're telling me that it 's * a lot of people * in a ** national referendum ** even though they are not only unrepresentative of the no-side but they are in reality as tiny as the population of amsterdam compared to ** the whole population of the kingdom of the netherlands **, 
  i technically have one dad and two moms . 
  ** i 'm pretty okay with my parents divorce and my step mom is cool **, 
  please write a book . 
  * please *, 
  this was my same reaction to this , i mean i have n't heard * one * bad and really dangerous thing going on in prague ( all i 've heard was its pretty cool history and architecture ) and yet how the hell did it get lower than istanbul and moscow ? 
  mysteries that shall go unresolved ... 
  so we need to include territories that are not in europe ? 
  plus , how would you include that demarcation on the sidebar considering , again , the sheer size of it all ? 
  i do , hence why i added the * fun * part in it . 
  still , my point remains the same : russia is depicted at the edge of the sidebar because * that 's exactly where russia is * i do n't see how a ) that translates as being the outskirts and b ) this seriously is a complaint considering that russia by far is the country that takes the most of the map , and it would be eerily difficult to show * all * of russia ( or even just the territory of it that 's in europe if we use the uralic mountains as a border ) and still be zoomed in enough to see kosovo , macedonia and montenegro . 
  russia is n't depicted as an outskirt of europe , russia is depicted where russia actually is ... 
  hope you speak french because this song is literally the biggest middle finger i know of in song form to the iron lady . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lohnbmglsb0 also , i often sing along replacing her name by marine lepen ( fits quite well ! ), 
  it 's not in portugal , it 's its own card that you have to ask for either on our e-government thingy or at a uhh ... citizen shop ? 
  ( i 've got no idea if a term exists for those in english but yeah , those ), 
  it does n't show all of portugal nor france either though . 
  russia is depicted like the outskirts because it not only has a majority of its territory * past * the ural mountains ( which is the usually assumed `` border '' of where europe ends and asian begins ) but also because russia * is * right at the edge . 
  you could argue the same for iceland , being depicted so far away , but the sole thing is that * it genuinely is over there , far away but still europe *, 
  there 's a very clear divide on that domain , in munich i did n't meet anybody ( aside from one bulgarian tourist ) who spoke russian , whereas in leipzig and dresden , well , that was actually quite common among the ddr generation of people ; the divide between the two is still quite pronounced . 
  am i the only one who sees this as a fun annual hunger games thing ? 
  i mean * come on *, 
  ** g\u00f6tterfunken intensifies **, 
  yes i know , that was precisely the whole point of the book . 
  it wanted to show that eastern europe as a concept is far older than communism and that the iron curtain was just a continuation of decades of this exact construct . 
  * inventing eastern europe * by wolff , hope you enjoy it !, 
  i do n't actually drink beer , and unfortunately i do n't think so ; i have a friend who loves everything alcohol , i can ask him for some good craft beer places . 
  this is all very true , and i think that it truly may make life hard for us . 
  as i lived in france i actually felt embarassed at times to say i 'm portuguese because i was constantly hearing the same jokes told about me like how i 'm dumb and hairy etc. . . so instead i 'd lie and say i 'm actually german , to just stop being associated with that image . 
  this even became more true where me and my mom , as we spoke portuguese in the streets when alone ( never when someone else was with us ) we 'd stop talking and switch to french while approaching this very patriotic portuguese hotspot in our city , because we did n't want to be recognised as such . 
  the french are not at all hateful or actively discriminatory against portuguese people though , it 's just that there 's a lot of prefixed ideas that are so often true that for the rest of us it 's a bit of a hassle to avoid . 
  my colleagues in high school used to laugh at me for being portuguese at times ( i 'd laugh with them even though sometimes it was tiring ) but then it really would surprise them when i 'd do very well in school ( as opposed to the other portuguese people there whose goals in life were all to be mechanics and such ) in subjects like maths and languages . 
  ah well , i hope you enjoyed your time here , feel free to come back any time . 
  pro tip : try out a coffeeshop called rusland ( it 's communist/putin themed but they are n't the crazy putinists we all dislike , they are super funny and open people with very good weed ), 
  there 's a quote from a book i read recently that i think describes this perfectly : * `` even though the iron curtain has fallen , its shadow still lingers '' *, 
  ` ayyy a fellow amsterdammer !, 
  welcome !, 
  i 'm portuguese and i went to france , and the case in france is quite peculiar . 
  they just show themselves and believe that portugal is the holy grail and really think of themselves as a minority in france ( which is true ) who happens to be `` the best '' ( not true ) . 
  as a result , some french people regard these usually louder portuguese people that spam the damn flag on * everything * ( not an understatement they have more flags than north korea i swear ) as poorly educated and although not undesireable , just not really `` as good '' as french people . 
  when i went back to portugal after years in france , i knew that these people acted a lot like you described ( some people i knew did the same with the uk ) and i hope that i do n't come across as one of them . 
  rightfully so . 
  i think he meant why is a push towards eu membership a bad thing , in your opinion ? 
  that * is * how it works for everybody , however morocco has the particularity of being a country that does not allow renunciation of citizenship , and as for turkey , they are very specific that you * must * renounce it to the point they have to precise that `` even male turkish nationals who have not completed their military service , are required to renounce turkish nationality . '', 
  you can check all the requirements and exceptions in the website of the dutch immigration and naturalisation service right [ here ] ( https://ind.nl/en ) the requirements for language for the exam itself are a2-levels , which i had to acquire in france in order to be able to attend french schools , and i can tell you that although inferior to fluency , the a2-level already gives you a pretty good basic hold of the language and with experience even if you do not actively practice it you just get it . 
  if there is a genuine flaw with the a2 testing and the applicant does not meet the requirements , that 's a problem of poor management/testing . 
   forced progress on the dutch language , rather than petty observation , it has to be in depth . 
  so if i already speak fluent dutch , and am a dutch citizen by naturalisation , what exactly do i do ? 
  just sit around and relearn dutch ? 
  and why is language the basis ( from what you said so far ) for your rehabilitation idea ? 
  so the us is just like sweden in that regard then , it 's * standard practice * to ignore the popular will . 
  double nationality including the dutch one is actually quite difficult . 
  in order to attain dutch nationality through naturalisation you must give up your previous one ( s ) . 
  if i , for example , want to become a dutch citizen i will need to no longer be a portuguese citizen anymore , and there are also actual integration tests you mus fulfill in order to apply . 
  these exams include : language ( you * must * be able to communicate in dutch ) , knowledge of dutch society , and as of 2015 also integration on the dutch labor market . 
  these are , of course , subject to rare exceptions here and there ( like not being required to pass a language test if you spent 8 years or more studying in a dutch public school , or not being examined on labor market-related integration if you are already fully retired . ), 
  out of curiosity : what do you mean by rehabilitation , like , what exactly would be the logistics behind such a feat ?
