  if the us and the eu want their people to reconnect as they used to it will take an actual consensus on what 's what , and not just a constant guessing game like we 're currently playing with the uk over the brexit . 
  lithuania for me is a great example of this reconnection via a concensus , i 've never met a lithuanian person before and i generally would think they are the stereotypical shit post-communist country that hates everything ... until i met one of my best friends who taught me about her country , and now i actually somewhat like the baltics ( and estonia ) a lot more . 
  i do n't think that the idea on neither side was a divide , it 's just that we are * not * the same people , but look at us europeans , hell , look at * me * , i was born and raised in portugal , then went to live off in france , then germany , and then the netherlands ; and although there were * a lot * of cultural differences and divides , we still do n't have this great divide between us , so maybe it does n't have to be the same for the us ; because it certainly is n't the case for canada for example ( lots of canadians here , they are basically the same as europeans but with slightly more american pop-culture references ), 
  for me it does n't seem * overly * strange as the truth is that rousseau was mostly right : you govern by consent of the people . 
  the people are used to stereotypes and try to predict what to expect , and nowadays the media plays an increasingly more dominant role on our views . 
  i think that there 's also some fact to it as well , nearly everyone i know who travelled to the us ( and also american tourists visiting lisbon , paris , or amsterdam ) all talked about the clear gap between our standards and american ones . 
  the example i found most often was something super simple : bread . 
  everyone i know who went to the us and has is european talks about how * way * sweeter ( and not in a positive way ) the bread is in the us . 
  so standards * are * different . 
  furthermore , do keep in mind that europeans are very proud and still today there is still some lingering resentment floating about from history ( like supporting salazar 's regime , older generations still are miffed about that , or goldman sach 's actions that pissed off a lot of younger people ) , plus we see the us as the crazy overachiever with far too much power and disregard for what we consider to be vital for us ( like welfare state ) . 
  it mainly boils down to two different ways of life , and it 's as if these clashes make the us and europe opposites ( even though they share * many * similarities ) in the case of canada , the actual standards are percieved as the same ( although i fully admit i do n't know to what extent they are actually that similar ) as a lot of canadian goods are sold in france ( mostly thanks to quebec ) and they genuinely are as good as their european counterparts . 
  furthermore , you do n't really hear about canadian differences with europe ; the sole two things i 've heard was differences regarding netflix and kraft dinner . 
  japan , for me at least , comes at an odd case , as it 's seen as a pretty awesome country for most europeans ; a rich very technologically-forward country with social welfare * based * on european models ; thus not raising any flags . 
  this might all seem like just , again , a game based in perception , but that 's because it is . 
  the eu has been losing face lately as we face many problems , so it all boils down to how the media will go about it and how it will all be percieved . 
  i , for one , still believe that it 's for the best that the eu steers clear from the us and russia for now . 
  well i 've been reading this thread and it 's as if you are not really willing to accept the general european view of ftas and of the us . 
  it was very clear that europe does not want to accept an fta with the us due to the fact that our view is that the us 's standards are too lacking for our taste ; so we do n't want us standards to be applied to our products . 
  the ceta was met with some resistance as , although canada ( according to our general view ) has better standards with the us and truly is more similar to european ones , it was seen as a gateway for the us as well . 
  so it was met with resistance ( there were other reasons too , but that 's the main us-related one ) and here comes japan , which holds an image of , again , high standards comparable to ours , so an fta would not really be opposed that much ( if at all ) . 
  the reality is this : the us for us is too big yet it does not uphold our standards , even though the eu and the us have quite warm relationships ( though considering the us presidency , i have no clue what will truly happen ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 've gotten plenty of views and opinions as to why the eu and russia merely do n't get along in the least . 
  so that 's the end result , at least from my perspective , on the difference between the ceta , the ttip , and this potentially new fta . 
  i really do n't have the time to read out your posts ( i 'd need to read context for * every single one * so i ca n't really help you with that ... 
  well , you should . 
  besides , is n't you selecting * this * example on another subreddit to come to r/europe and discuss it on a post about an fta deal between the eu and japan a little bit proving what some might associate with americans ? 
  coming to r/europe and starting up pointless beef ? 
  a cunt is a cunt regardless of nationality or continent . 
  my personal judgement is the following : there are lots of great users in r/europe , a vast majority europeans , but also a few asians and americans that contribute nicely ; and then there are also assholes that spoil it for everyone , whether they are european or not . 
  that might be true , but not because they are american , some are genuinely cunts ( same applies for any nationality ) . 
  mind you that there are americans that come to r/europe and genuinely contribute quite nicely , and they also happen not to be the ones complaining ... hmmm ... 
  i got smashed today with my local finn with some good ol finlandia . 
  tried singing the anthem ( did not work out but at leastr i tried ) fuck yeah suomi rock that shit . 
  surprisingly often . 
  i have been to munich , to berlin , to london and even * lived * in paris ... 
  it 's all very predominantly white people . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're the type of dude that sees like 5 black people in a bus and starts feeling nervous about this sort of complete bullshit . 
  i can relate , i mean , i love the eu but i agree with your points . 
  there are , and they are amazing . 
  well that 's a leap of assumptions ... 
  what do you mean ? 
  i think thay are moreso defending it due to the value of the * memory * it holds . 
  it 's a very important element that represents a very important part of their history , even if it 's a ** very ** dark part of it . 
  but ... but why ? 
  yeah , there 's bound to be exceptions . 
  there 's a bloody place called cuba in portugal and a whole part of the netherlands called poortugaal . 
  i still find it really linguistically amazing how one half of the country has * very * dutch names , and then the other half has * very * french names . 
  it 's just cool to see that the linguistic border is really present , like in berlin where east and west have different light bulbs for streetlights and thus they still look a bit divided, 
  do n't get to say this too often nowadays but ** good going russia , that 's actually pretty damn cool **, 
  my friend from rotterdam showed ** exactly ** just how proud of rotterdam when i showed her poortugaal ( aka she went apeshit on rotterdamse ... patriotism ? 
  basically she fucking loves the place like it 's cocaine ), 
  i 'm half french as well ( got dual citizenship after living near paris for quite a few years ) . 
  again , broadcast channels were an * example * of something much wider . 
  i do believe that the us has a very wide range of topics that can be discussed , however i think that it 's not necessarily wider , but merely different in nature on what actually can be fully discussed ( and to what degree ) but also to the degree it 's practiced . 
  i agree with everything you say , however , i did some browsing to find examples of these websites , and what they say and present as `` scientifical evidence '' is genuine crap and blatantly lies about inexistant studies and research . 
  for me this ban * is * as much in order as is a ban on the anti-vaxx propaganda we see here and there . 
  i get what you 're saying , but from my understanding these calls for violence will , ultimate , blossom into reality . 
  we can not really advocate mass murders without fully speaking out and ordering people to do it ( mind you this is an example , i 'm not saying it 's 100 % what everyone will do it ) . 
  thus by limiting the voice that calls for such atrocities , we can maintain a more peaceful and reasonable society . 
  societies all come with rules , and indeed this idea of freedom of speech is not at all fully implemented , there is always going to be things you should n't say and i think that in the case of banning for example advocacy to kill all [ insert anything here ] or fake scientifical reports proving vaccines cause autism or something . 
  the best case scenario was clear rules on what 's allowed and what is not , but also a clear peaceful and democratic method to change what those are , so if for example , in country a you want to be able to criticise your leader , then there should be a fast and indisputable democratic process to open up dialog about the leader and criticise him , but not fully abolish all restrictions , just the ones judged necessary by most people . 
  for me i can predict immense instability . 
  we 're really opening pandora 's box with it in my view , for example , publically calling for the lynching and murder of different groups would be fully legal , and seen how geert wilders just asking `` do we want less moroccans here ? '', 
  in a rally ( which in my opinion should not have been trialed so harshly ) sparked actual violent action against them ; and other cases , it shows that really we need a basic set of rules to prevent us from going full on with that . 
  tv was just an example , but the usual trend is true for nearly all forms of expression . 
  also you are not free to put absolutely everything and anything you want on cable channels nor the internet either . 
  my main point is that there is always going to be regulation and censorship , there is no country that can have a 100 % open freedom of speech policy . 
  the main thing is that there is no black/white distinction when it comes to it , and instead there are different degrees raging from north korea-type total restrictions to * far * looser but still present restrictions like the netherlands or the us, 
  even kim jong un is like `` oshit i 'm about to lose these electionseven i ca n't not vote for her in my riggetty system '', 
  i studied a lot about us tv regulations , and compared to portugal ( my hometown ) it 's far more limited on a legal context . 
  it * does * seem a lot freer since the us also happens to have a * lot * more of drama craptastic tv channels that give the perception they truly show everything ( tlc ... ) . 
  it 's a very interesting topic , and some tv shows are really borderline when it comes to the law ( like 16 and pregnant ) . 
  i agree that nobody has full freedom of speech , and that indeed there is censorship . 
  i 'm merely unsure how we can call the degree of freedom we have by contrast to , let 's say , belarus , china , russia , etc. . . where there are far tighter controls . 
  * we will take you by surprise *, 
  well , actually i think that the us does have a * lot * of limits on freedom of speech , specially regarding tv ( tonnes upon tonnes of odd occurences where words can not be said or elements performed but whatever ) , the sole meaningful difference with europe is the way these are carried out for me . 
  furthermore , the us is n't exactly what i 'd call a great example at all of its practice . 
  i * do * see the conflict though , how can we say `` freedom of speech '' but still uphold essentially censorship laws ? 
  then what country in the world has freedom of speech ? 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's no country who does by those standards . 
  i think we should merely leave it as private property . 
  let them fund the churches themselves , and if they fail to do so it 's up to the state to decide whatever it wants to do with the churches . 
  i think that either we can , indeed , use it for providing shelter for the ones who need it , or also a cultural landmark ( if it really is an important one ) . 
  i just think religion needs to get out the way legally and whatever the people decide to do , as long as it 's not dangerous to themselves and others , is their own decision . 
  i was about to say `` i doubt anyone cares that much '' but after scrolling down and seeing all those delicious anal-painful threads i am so much more satisfied . 
  hell , not even all the balms in my local pharmacy can cure that, 
  * well it 's not like we gave a huge fu notice to putin when he visited *, 
  i 'd vote for her . 
  as long as none of those are extreme i 'm pretty okay with it . 
  i 've talked to 3 gay dudes at a club who thought that `` gays who do n't have aids are n't even real gays they are just pussies '' and * i wish * they were joking porn actors ... well it 's a profession is n't it ? 
  just do n't do it in public and keep it safe . 
  islamist , well , i really do n't know what the difference is between this and a muslim but i think muslims just believe and practice islam whereas an islamist actually preaches it and ( if extreme ) can ehh ... have a nice holiday in paris let 's call it that . 
  so i think that * this * is the part that causes the issue : extremism in any form, 
  i would n't ban them , but i 'd remove all benefits from it and treat it as i think they should be treated : a personal affair that does n't need to be evoked publicly further than history classes . 
  you believe whatever you choose to believe but if you keep it within your own personal social groups . 
  nearly all of europe has similar laws , and honestly i do n't feel like being allowed to deny the holocaust or approve of terrorists is really a big deal . 
  i do understand what you say though , it * does * show that there is n't full freedom of expression , but i genuinely think no country does as it would be unmanageable keep in mind that in the netherlands ' penal code there is this crime :  ... deliberately giv [ ing ] public expression to views insulting to a group of persons on account of their race , religion , or conviction or sexual preference . 
  so i think that it 's more of a `` my freedom stops where other people 's freedom begins '', 
  * oh god no * ** not the french **, 
  i think that geert wilders ' polls might not be the strongest indicators ( from what i 've heard from my local dutch people , opinion polls are n't very reliable for elections in the netherlands ) , however there is * no * denying that there are tensions that are definitely at play here .
