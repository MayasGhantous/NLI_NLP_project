  seriously though i was sorta shocked when i moved to amsterdam * i have n't used actual cash in so damn long *, 
  guys guys guys * i think we kicked armenia out of europe *, 
  i think that visa free travel only ensures them basically visitor rights , they can come and visit , but not really live/work without the adequate regular procedure . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong though , i admit i 've never been great with this sort of thing, 
  * was the first thing i 've ever learned in danish ... then i tried speaking danish with a dane after a month of studying it and ... well it turns out i understand and speak swedish better by accident ... 
  a titanic success indeed , n'est pas ? 
  well * that 's * surely a titanic success ... 
  i 'm sorry but this is * far * too good not to steal . 
  congratulations this is the best thing i 've read all week . 
  that, 
  ... i just wanted to build a snowman , jesus ... * y' all got ta chill *, 
  ooooooh , i thought he was talking about recent annexations . 
  good job on the singing revolution btw !, 
  crimea and ... ? 
  sorry i honestly ca n't remember anymore . 
   someone who can drive cars , submarines and fighter jets and we 're good to go . 
  i can take that position , my dad taught me how to take off and land a light aircraft * instead of teaching me how to bike * so ya know . 
  i seriously wonder what are the actually ridiculous regulations the eu has , i think that one about straight cucumbers was a pretty big contender i mean ... ffs who cares xd, 
  ** does not comply with glorious eu regulation on doughnut pastry requirement n \u00b0 543-582 ** ** triggered ** / s, 
  i 've read a lot about the history of ireland , and how it became divided , and i thonk that imposing an actual border there would be singlehandedly a catastrophe for anything near it . 
  i 'm a bit fearful because there 's so much shite being flung due to this whole brexit deal that i fear for my friends who study/work in scotland and england , their futures are * still * not safe . 
  i am conflicted in the question , because for me i believe that the eu is a * good * organisation ( despite its current flaws of which there are * many * ) and i want it to keep on existing . 
  so the eu , in order to maintain its status , would need the uk 's brexit to seriously be ultimately a failure , and make the uk worse off ... 
  but i also believe that the turnout that did n't even reach 80 % to my knowledge and only 52 % of those voters actually wanted to leave shows that the uk is n't really an island of euroscepticism , plus , * it 's the uk they have been with us for decades * so i do n't want the british citizens themselves to have to pay the price . 
  how do you think that the eu can stand strong with the brexit , but still manage to make sure that british citizens wo n't be fucked over ? 
  that sounds much more reasonable , sorry i was thinking that the cta was a mere border thing with ireland , not encompassing other rights . 
  this makes the whole question of the irish border really a non-issue with the eu , though i still wonder ( and worry ) about the current eu ( non british ) citizens working in the uk . 
  will their rights be maintained ? 
  or could there be an exclusion of eu workers from the uk ( which seems dangerous to do from my perspective ) ? 
  ... nokia rainboots ? 
  aaah , yeah that makes more sense . 
  thanks !, 
  yes , but in practice , by having an essentiall open-border agreement with ireland ( part of the eu , thus eu citizens can go there willy nilly ) it also opens up a way for eu citizens to get into the uk via ireland , unless of course you establish border checks . 
  well , if ireland is inside the cta , so is the rest of the eu . 
  i thought that it was a tiny joke at ireland being part of the uk . 
  did n't a uk government worker talk about the irish border between the roi and ni as `` an internal border '' ? 
  stop it , you 're making me [ blush .

  i never said that it was credible or not , all i said is that * there are standards and practices available online , of which you were asking for and you can literally click on one button and try it out yourself to judge just how well they fit with the ielts and toefl examinations * page 5 of the eurobarometer, 
  i talked to you about ef 's standards and practices and they are * literally available as the first result of google right [ here ] ( https://www.efset.org/nl/ ) * and furthermore , reread page 5 and check its footnotes first . 
  i do n't really care for downvotes , so feel free to leave them , i * do * care about an actual discussion that doesnt shift all over the place each and every single time a new piece of information is brought , just like you 've been doing , plus now you 're calling me childish because i downvote you , do i even need to say anything ? 
  you do n't focus at all on what i am saying and instead shift the subject to another area of concern ; now you entirely ignored * actual statistics from other sources * to talk about downvoting . 
  feel free to downvote mine too , i always either upvote or downvote regarding content , so go right ahead . 
  why would you believe * any * statistics ? 
  [ the eurobarometer says it 's at around 90 % ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf ) and [ even other sources say the same ] ( https://alisonedwardsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/phd-thesis_edwards.pdf ) statistics are statistics , they require further explanation , but to discard a fact that is show by multiple sources just because you ca n't be bothered to read the actual studies conducted in the matter is purely lazy . 
  look at the post , go to ef 's website , and see the standards written by yourself . 
  and then take a look at french exams ( available * for free * online ) and check it yourself . 
  i 'm done here , i literally quoted * facts * but you wo n't believe them and then say `` oh no but ... no '' . 
  i got the assumption by the fact that most people in the world * learn english in their middle and high schools * if the school system has nothing to do with this then you can not judge intellectual skills at all ... 
  language happens to be one and dutch people massively learn english in schools and get even better results due to the massive influx of english language content . 
  you can not judge * anything nor anyone * 's level without standard examination proceedures , specially when the source * is an education agency for foreign languages * i do n't assume that they are excluded , i merely assume that , by typical dutch standards of employment ( which require proof of proficiency in either dutch or english ) it 's very very easy to imagine that these workers in the netherlands * do * count . 
  you asked for standards , i gave you the company who posted these statistics ' standards , you asked for possible explanations , i gave you possible explanations based on concrete evidence based on what exactly * gives * people a certain level at a language . 
  the sole problem here is that you do not wish to hear it , you for some reason just want to hate and discard these statistics . 
  well , i do n't really have access to all the statistics possible nor do i have access to danish english exams to properly judge . 
  i can say , however , that middle and high school are determining factors on these matters and the actual mere description of these exams can very much influence this . 
  let 's take a look at france : the lv1 and lv2 level for language ( very rarely anything other than english for lv1 ) is officially a b1 level , and for lv3 it 's just an a2 level . 
  however , the exams themselves are actually very easy to have a * passing * grade in ( which is 10/20 ) and that only demonstrates a half-assed b1 level rather than an actual solid level ( plus the exams themselves tend to revolve far too much on repetition than actual language skills ) . 
  in the netherlands , since i have no access to your english examination proceedures , i can not judge exactly if the passing grade in the dutch system ( 5.5 / 10 ) is actually sufficient to prove the level required for the examination . 
  the same goes for danish examination proceedures . 
  furthermore , you could also suspect that it 's not * only * dutch people being counted but also anyone living in the netherlands , and i can tell you that to come here to either work or study will very often require you to pass a toefl or an ielts exam to prove your proficiency in english , thus adding to the amount of the population that fills the required standard . 
  they use a company called ef ( education first ) 's standards , and i already had some experiences with that company ( they organised a 2 week german course in berlin for me ) . 
  all my documents use the common european framework of reference for language ( cefr ) which is the usual a1-c2 grading system , so by that definition , i 'd say that the standard would be between b2 and c1 . 
  b2 is described as `` the capacity to achieve most goals and express oneself on a range of topics . 
  example : can show visitors around and give a detailed description of a place . '', 
  c1 is described as `` the ability to communicate with the emphasis on how well it is done , in terms of appropriacy , sensitivity and the capacity to deal with unfamiliar topics . 
  example : can deal with hostile questioning confidently . 
  can get and hold onto his/her turn to speak . '',

  well , usually the train goes to * poland * but ya know, 
  i 've visited rural areas in portugal , i 've visited france in general , some parts of the ex-gdr , taiwan , and a part of spain . 
  * trust me , that 's something you 're taking for granted a lot *, 
  yeah , we just need to listen to , ya know , * build a wall * , that obviously has never failed in history has it ? 
  specially not in europe ^ / s, 
  well there is * one * solution ... a more * permanent * solution ... a last , ending , * final * solution . 
  so basically we 're stuck then . 
  we ca n't appease russia as it 's basically just a hungry bear waiting to devour its next meal , so what truly can we do to solve this situation ? 
  i think the fact that russia took crimea clearly shows that russia does n't care for gains , it cares for having and winning , not a lot much more than that . 
  these are amazing and tragic events to hear about , and what makes it even scarier it 's that it feels like it 's very recent . 
  when i think about communism it 's always a conflict between a faraway past that is entirely gone in , for example , prague , but then the memory of it is so vivid and 1991 was a mere 25 years ago ; it 's really like that monster under your bed . 
  i really sometimes fear for estonia , latvia , and lithuania , because it 's true that those countries are very small and a bit defenseless against russia ; but i 'm glad that they are part of nato and the eu , thus giving them more protection against the russian threat ... 
  i just really hope that nato truly holds solid , and that the eu army proposition is passed . 
  is it likely for russia to really want to invade estonia ? 
  or any european neighbouring state ? 
  i 'm sorry i ask so many questions , i truly just do n't really know a lot about the subject at all ... 
  woah , thanks !, 
  this seems exactly like the kind of stuff i really like reading and learning about . 
  it 's amazing how this all came to be in my opinion , i could only imagine having my tiny appartment in tallinn , then see my neighbours deported to a gulag and replaced by occupiers ( plus using nightgowns for ... interesting purposes ) . 
  in your view , do you think russian populations still influence estonia a lot ? 
  maybe as a way to sorta keep it close to russia ? 
  how was this movement of russians into estonia carried out ? 
  it seems really amazing and alien to me that the ussr would just `` russify '' your population . 
  i wonder how it was put into practice , though the objectives seem pretty self evident . 
  ... well it was never great so ... 
  i mean ... 
  i see it more and more often that a lot of people start believing that russia truly has n't done anything wrong and it 's all just western propaganda whenever russia is even lightly criticised . 
  the fact is , russia very much is a growing danger that needs to be dealt with . 
  i always grew up with a sepparation of neo-nazis and uhh ... not really pro-soviets ( the soviet union was already over ) but neo-communists/socialists ? 
  well , basically they are sorta treated as two different types of idiots , but still both idiots . 
  really ? 
  i 'm already pretty dumb but uh ... could they really not tell the difference between an evening dress and a nightgown ?
