  what scares me is that there * are * people who believe this , and these people are around . 
  it 's a bit haunting , like neo-nazis or openly fascist movements , just sorta makes your blood ever so slightly cold . 
  ^ sorry , ^ i ^ forgot ^ estonia ^ is ^ finnic . 
  i mean ... we were too busy draining the everlasting fuck out of the sea and blocking out the haters . 
  now we even got flevoland and shit . 
  `` kanojo '' sounds like `` que nojo '' in portuguese to me ... in english it 's `` how gross '' japan you got some repressed libido you got ta take care of goddamn . 
  oh god ... sadly true , it 's full of frigging ex-farmer nationalists who always have that one sticker on their cars . 
  portugal 's probably next , it 's about to rename the damn place `` new lisbon '', 
  i think the question is too binary : yes i want a federal europe but we are nowhere near ready for one at all ; so i think we need to take our time and let the eu evolve itself , see where it takes us , and * then * we 'll see about a federation . 
  as an amsterdammer , i 'd absolutely love this , since i love broadcasting and tv stuffs . 
  i wonder where in amsterdam they would go actually , i 'm not sure what infrastructure they 'd require . 
  sooo ... kuomintang ruling taiwan was n't a bad thing , it was actually pretty great right ? 
  fresh start and all . 
  we got our police , national airlines , banks , and mcdonald 's all propped up with gay flags . 
  ** match us **, 
  yes , this , plus due to the euro 's design there was far less of a way to ever help greece from the get-go since there was a no-bailouts policy and there also were inflation rules in place cutting greece 's overspending and thus lowering demand and thus lowering production etc. . . shit went hella down because of the euro 's incomplete design , and it 's been something that even before the euro was adopted in 1999-2003 , economists were already warning us over its incomplete design and weakness regarding economic shocks . 
  we need to complete the euro , and though the greek crisis triggered more action and now ( though a bit too late to solve it ) there 's been more advances but still not enough . 
  i 'm also from portugal . 
  why are you claiming all our views as your own ? 
  wait until you see portuguese transports , where shit does n't make any damn sense and buses often have the creative freedom to fucking change their routes with no warning . 
   just fine ... ehmm ... 
  determine who is `` we '' and you 'll see things in a different light . 
  i have a golden sharpie , maybe we can work something out ? 
  believe me mate , i 've lived most my life in portugal and france , and ** i am never taking this beautiful thing for granted holy fuck **, 
  ing , amro , deutsche bank , etc. . . are all in zuidoost . 
  zuid still has some , but fewer . 
  but a tramway is n't as flexible as a bus , since it ** has ** to fully stay in one line , one lane . 
  a bus can easily contour any obstacles with some slight adjustments where possible . 
  to me it sounds like the bus system is n't properly designed , trying to send too big buses in too small areas ; but as the case may be for the historical inner city i think you 're right , trams * do * seem like the way to go since everything 's so tiny . 
  was any explanation given ? 
   i think a tramsystem would have been a tremendous improvement over the bussystem that groningen currently has , and more fitting than a subway system given the size of the city . 
  what would the advantages of a tram system be for groningen over the current bus system and a subway system ? 
  ( honest question , do n't know much about it ) . 
  that 's because you probably are making the rookie mistake of comparing amsterdam centrum ( where * nothing * wants to move there because it 's basically the beyonc\u00e9 of amsterdam ) and zuidoost & zuid ( where all the banks are because it 's dirt cheap ) . 
  they likely will go to zuidoost , or just use the headquarters they already have that are in zuid * really * close to the border with amstelveen ( again , * far * cheaper than the rest of amsterdam ) . 
   only place with a remotely ` big city ' feel well , i 'd argue that rotterdam has this , perhaps at times more than amsterdam . 
  check his username , he 's a troll . 
  it 's already very much happening , the place used to be a huge desert of failed 1960s ambitious architecture projects ; since the 1990 's they 've been demolishing the shite old buildings and getting more sensible infrastructure instead , often at times super modern cool stuff , like the bijlmer arena area . 
  zuidoost is becoming better and better , and it reflects on its rising prices . 
  however also keep in mind that a ** lot ** of the banking-related professionals do n't actually live here . 
  they take the train from wherever they live to the bijlmer arena station and then they 're just a km or two from their offices tops ( some employers even cover travel expenses of this type , and the service is reliable and cheap ) . 
  ... you can get an even better quality print for like 2 $ at a printing house ? 
  if the usk is such a dealbreaker to you that is . 
  i used to design the covers for my own games and print them in this shiny finish paper at a printing house , carefully cut them up , and they looked pretty much like an official thing . 
  your choice if you do n't want a game because of a logo though . 
  amsterdammer here : banks usually have a fuck tonne of offices in a region called zuidoost , a lovely part of amsterdam that is divided from the rest of the city ( there 's another tiny city called diemen in the way ) . 
  stuff here is ** far ** cheaper than central amsterdam real-estate wise ; as a result a lot of the new offices for companies end up here . 
  amsterdam is still very expensive but compared to paris or london , prices are quite lower . 
  edit : keep in mind that mufg already has offices in amsterdam in zuid , really close to the border with amstelveen ( significantly cheaper than centrum and other more known and popular regions ), 
  why not just print a clean ( or even * custom * ) cover afterwards ? 
  most cases i know use paper that fits an a4 format and a printing house can give you a high quality finish . 
  perhaps with time the gap between russian and latvian schools will become less and less ; and * then * there will be an opportunity to have a more unified schooling , with an option for the minorities to keep studying their languages . 
  i do n't think that it would be good to just jump from one system to another , instead they should start teaching each and every young kid latvian from a very early age ( if they do n't speak it ) and * then * make the necessary reforms once every student can comfortably make the transition . 
  ** fuck yeah ** this will go well at / r/cirkeltrek, 
  * very * different questions , and also different years . 
  but * what is the reason for an exception * ? 
  that 's my main question . 
  other countries , such as france , the netherlands , germany , etc. . . also have minority languages that are kept alive and still used , but they never will be a replacement for any base academics nor the national language itself . 
  but why is it a thing to begin with ? 
  i see no real usage for an exception being opened to the russian minority . 
  i do n't see * what * the purpose of learning in russian rather than latvian ** in latvia ** and especially since you must learn it anyways is . 
  in the netherlands we do n't have any schools that allow kids to learn everything in frisian for example . 
  frisian is still taught , and there are even advanced courses ; but by no means do we allow schools to just function with it and no dutch . 
  if learning latvian really is not an option in the least , then why are there russian schools to begin with ? 
  that 's what i do n't understand . 
  going to a russian school enforces learning of latvian , so why not just stop dividing public education , and having one main latvian course with advanced russian options for native speakers ? 
   what would you suggest should be done to a 6 year old kid that does n't speak a word of the national language ( s ) , then ? 
  what if that means a handful of kids in every class and pretty much every kid in some cities ? 
  just force it down their throats ? 
  they should definitely learn one of the national languages , otherwise they will be constantly limited and hindered . 
  imagine living as someone who ** only ** speaks swedish in finland . 
  sure you can live a life but it * will * put you at a disadvantage with finnish speakers because the great vast majority of finland speaks finnish . 
   i think you 're concentrating too much on your own experience . 
  you ca n't mirror that to the situation in , say , narva where over 80 % of the population considers themselves as russian . 
  in the case of narva , i still believe that they are no exception to public education and their children should learn the national language ** of the country they live in ** . 
  i do n't consider myself dutch so am i excused from learning dutch ? 
  of fucking course not . 
  i do n't believe that identity should be a factor that should hinder the education of the kids in narva ; and even * if * they consider themselves russian , would learning latvian kill them at all ? 
  they can still speak russian and celebrate russian culture all they want , but just * learn * latvian as they are in a place called latvia . 
   edit : that 's not even without getting into the whole national language issue - who gets to define it ? 
  how big of a minority do you think there should be that it would be fair to say that their language is a national language ? 
  i 'm not sure if you brought up afrikaans for this very reason . . well that 's precisely the problem . 
  in my eyes , latvia has * one * national language : latvian . 
  for belgium , due to their national identity of what a belgian is , they have 3 of them . 
  the dutch only have one too , yet frisian and such still thrive and exist ** without ** making special schools where kids only use those languages . 
  we 're both speaking english right now , are n't we ? 
  yet i 've only ever been in an english-speaking part of the world for two weeks , and i already spoke it . 
  language , with the appropriate resources , can be taught * very * well . 
  when i moved to france , i was 14 years old and did n't really speak french . 
  all schools are in french so they have a system in place : lots of schools have special classes where you ** only ** learn french as a foreigner , usually for about 6 months , a year , maximum i 've ever heard is two years . 
  you do n't do anything else but learn the language to an extent that you can fully study in it . 
  it 's called `` classe d'accueil '' or cla . 
  i believe that , for the russian-speaking minorities that * do n't * speak latvian to an extent that they can study in it , these classes would make sure that any and all students in latvia can accompany the regular classes . 
  i believe that education for minorities should be made available for their language , but there should not be any option to * not * properly learn the national language . 
  i was able to fully continue studying portuguese as a second language at a very advanced level ( though i decided to learn some german instead ) , yet my education still was in french . 
  what 's the prospects for a 9th and a 12th grade graduate in latvia ? 
  belgians are taught ** in their national languages ** , you are taught in flemish , german , or french , not afrikaans . 
  i believe that requiring that children learn the national language of a country , and study * in that language * but also be free to practice and develop whichever other language they wish to ( be it their first , second , third ... ) is not at all an issue . 
  my first language is portuguese , yet i learned french and did all my obligatory schooling in french without ever really suffering from it ; and continued to study and develop my portuguese both at home and via a secondary option ; because ** i was in france and they speak french **, 
  so you can only really graduate in latvian then ?
