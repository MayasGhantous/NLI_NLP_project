  if latvian is , indeed , very important , what purpose does a russian school have in distinction to a latvian one ? 
  why not have regular latvian schools with advanced russian courses ; as well as a beginner level programme to make sure any and all non-latvian speakers can go for any studies ? 
  unfortunately so , i do n't see why learning the national language is fascist but then again i once got called a racist for not liking spicy curry . 
  what is the place of latvian in russian schools in latvia ? 
  is it taught at all ? 
  i believe that each and every single student * must * be taught lithuanian/latvian/estonian to a degree they fully can function in that language for all their base academic purposes . 
  russian , as a minority language , should never serve as a main one base academically in my opinion . 
  there are heaps and heaps of portuguese-speakers in france , however there are no portuguese-speaking schools ; and the same goes for any other minority . 
  french schools are in * french * just as estonian schools should be in * estonian * . 
  for higher studies ? 
  sure , go with whatever language you fancy . 
  for more basic studies like high school ? 
  * speak the language * . 
   latvian schools in latvia . 
  ... wait a damn minute , the baltics still have russian-speaking schools that do n't speak their languages ? 
  just how far does this russian/baltic thing go ? 
  we ** literally ** are called `` low countries '' in french , portuguese , spanish etc. . . a great chunk of our mainland is * below * sea level . 
  we wanted more lebensraum \u00a9 and since we could n't nor invade france nor invade germany , we just decided to fuck over the sea and reclaim a fuck tonne of land thanks to dams . 
  so the lack of any authority = full freedom ? 
  if so , who determines any standards for absolutely anything ? 
  what stops anyone from killing you for example ? 
  well , in some cases , such as child health , yes it is . 
  children ** must ** go to school in france , there is absolutely no question that a child must receive an education ; it is forced and i agree with it . 
  i 'm forced to pay taxes too , and i do n't mind doing it one bit , because hey , it is for a common good that i agree with ; to fund our schools , hospitals , road renovations , etc. . . 
  forcing parents to take proper care of their children is now something that generates debate ? 
  well , i 'd consider the dunkirk events as pretty sensitive to some , considering how disastrous it was considering how many people died in horrid conditions . 
  i 'm not saying we ca n't joke about it , but it just feels like an edgy teenager joke about something that will definitely offend someone in poor taste . 
  a 13 year old trying to be the next frankie boyle but failing miserably , basically . 
  aaah , i see , so she 's become * that * type of famous character . 
  i think that if people really , truly dislike her and wish her gone ; then they 'd ignore her entirely and she 'd be irrelevant . 
  my best guess is that she is easy to hate , to bitch about , to make fun of , thus generating more talk about her and more fame . 
  no such thing as bad publicity right ? 
  really ? 
  why was she already hated ? 
  i know very little about her to be fully honest . 
  i 'll make sure i check out that series , sounds very interesting . 
  i think it 's very true , although sometimes i also think that there is a * huge * overreaction when it comes to offensive material ; i remember this american comedian called roseanne barr once sang the national anthem at the superbowl * as worst as actually possible * . 
  it made me laugh quite a bit but i think that the people who got ** super ** offended by it need to chill ... [ bless this woman i swear ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls1yvhcld2c ), 
  eh , it 's not so much about others ' feelings to be fair , it mainly just feels cheap and bad . 
  you know a really bad pun ? 
  basically that , but also about a subject that it 's bound to offend some people . 
  if you 're gon na be potentially offensive at least be funny , otherwise , like this paper , it reminds me of those edgy 13 year-old `` comedians '' whose punchline 33 % of the time is the word `` pussy '' . 
  well , you 're assuming we can expect better from him , and from gazeta polska ... 
  sad truth is that i expect better from the daily mail than i do from both . 
  i 've been discovered ** *** abort ***, 
  never have i ever heard about this paper , oddly enough . 
  this actually looks like a very bad parody * of * a paper . 
  i really think that the joke is a bit too sensitive a subject for such a cheap shot . 
  i 'm not very well-read on health and such , anyone care explaining if there 's any health effects over chlorinated chicken ? 
  sure , it sounds utterly horrible , but i 'd rather have information if it * actually * is anything to be concerned of . 
  i scored a 24 . 
  i ca n't say i 'm not happy to be honest . 
  i expected to do far worse !, 
  also , any conversation books you recommend ? 
  that idea sounded really cool . 
  we 're sorry , guys :(, 
  ... so we 're going to ignore that czech officials actually spoke against the recent law changes in poland ? 
  how can you just generalize that the v4 is nothing but greedy , racist , and xenophobic countries ? 
  while ignoring that the reality of the matter is that the * hungarian and polish * government are the ones acting this manner . 
   it 's a marxist thing lol well , your username sure as fuck tells me you 're ready for [ ** la lute finale ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkdd1h-hlpc ), 
   the corporate elites needed some new cause to create social divisions . 
  so they came up with transexual bathrooms . 
  so americans started to fight each others on transexual bathrooms . 
  now that we are almost done with gay marriage , the same kind of issues ( transexual bathrooms , etc. . ) will start popping up in europe . 
  oh hello , this is the netherlands , the first country to ever legalize gay marriage 16 years ago and also hosts fully equal rights for gay people no questions asked . 
  * never have we ever heard of any of these issues here * america is n't europe , we do n't have ripe crazy people in charge that want to pass bills on which bathrooms you 're allowed to take a piss in . 
  just use whichever fits you best if you 're transgender ... 
  ** i am a god **, 
  let 's trade it for zuid brabant . 
  so you want to go back to colonisation times ? 
  yeah , i 'm sure * algeria * loved being french , and never really posed a problem , right ? 
   maybe its because i just recently made this account and your comments go back before then ? 
  thus far you have n't really defended any gay rights and instead just criticize attention towards russia 's huge problems whilst ignoring that poland , romania , etc. . . * also * get attention . 
  plus you talked about gay conversion therapy which is n't allowed in nearly all european countries already and is an extremely fringe practice if at all . 
   im not petty enough to check through people 's comments , i can only react to what i see . 
  if that 's your perogative , sure , i do n't really care what you do or do n't . 
   if you think the gay purge is worse than what the muslims are doing to the gays in their communities you 're ignorant of an issue you should know about . 
  the danish gay community is filled with muslims who have been beaten and near raped for being gay , its just not written about it requires personal experience . 
  ** we 're in europe , on a subreddit called r/europe ** and we happen to have a ** very small ** muslim minority in our continent . 
  we are not talking about lgbt discrimination in the mena countries or are we ? 
  denmark is * not * a savage forest that attacks people for their sexuality ; and i do n't see how in any way this relates to what you were saying . 
  do you want to discuss further problems ? 
  go right ahead , i 'd actually like that to be written about , but i still believe that there are other , bigger issues than small minorities discriminating against gay people , especially in countries ** where authorities take no shit when it comes to that ** . 
   the fact that you need to make up stuff like me believing that you hate me just goes to show that your position in this debate is weak , hating on somebody is not the same actually hating a person . 
  i do n't hate you , you 're not that important . 
  i 'd like for you to pinpoint what i made up too . 
   as a gay person you should know the difference . 
  oh so because i 'm gay i 'm supposed to act a certain way ? 
  why do n't you just consider me a regular person regardless of my sexuality then ? 
   edit : dont think i ever met a former muslim who was gay that wasnt beaten to shits , threatened and forced out of their home for being gay , how can you be ignorant of this issue i 've met plenty in france and the netherlands . 
  being gay does n't always mean the worst in europe , and though muslim communities * do * have severe problems dealing with gay descendants , that does not mean that europe is a hellhole nor that we are as bad as ** a country killing gay people via an organized purge ** . 
  i have yet to see any evidence of your initial statement over gay conversion camps being an active problem in europe , which you seem to have ditched completely ; then you mention problems with muslim communities which are already a minority and not really the biggest threat to gay people in europe in my experience when you compare it to countries where you get * prosecuted * for being gay ( poland ) or even * killed * ( russia ) . 
  it does because that 's what we had before the eu and we were * not * even half as efficient as we are now . 
  we had scientists locked to specific country-to-country research due to visa and work permit requirements , markets for materials were also a huge hassle since it is ** very ** hard to import/export scientific products when every country has different standards ... competition remained the same , but the eu made sure that europe cooperates efficiently towards scientific development instead of being divided and being just a bunch of teeny tiny small and impotent countries we 're now a strong union of them with * the * most efficient research and development scientific force . 
   cows do n't listen to ministry of labour . 
  never expected for this to ever make sense , but it did . 
  kudos to you . 
  i do n't think that the british system ( nor the american one ) are that good . 
  they allow for politicians to push important contradictive agendas and leave the people helpless against it ; as was for example the case with the uk being dragged to war in iraq even though it was a * highly * controversial issue ; yet had no input from the brits themselves . 
  politicians in the uk are pushing for shite the people did n't ask for while also not fulfilling their promises ; and yet they get away with it .
