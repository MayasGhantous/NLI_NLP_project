  this seems to be another case of a politician just getting through an election and then doing sweet fuckall about his/her promises while pushing whatever will keep him/her in power . 
  such is the joy of british politicians . 
   they voted in the tories . 
  now the tories get to do this . 
  tough luck . 
  maybe this will cause them to vote labour next time . 
  tories got even less support after the last ge , they do n't even have a majority to begin with . 
  i could say tough tits to all americans who now have trump even though he did n't even get the popular vote and the system for elections is systemically undemocratic ; or tough tits to anyone living in china who wishes for change . 
  brits did n't ask for this , and it 's not like labour is a shining beacon of hope either ; considering what other policies they have in mind . 
   i did n't say i supported the restrictions either , just that imposing restrictions is better than banning porn . 
  i personally think we should educate people instead . 
  here 's what i wrote : but i think we should instead work to talk about the harms of porn and discourage people from watching it in their adolescence . 
  well , surprise surprise , that 's already done in other countries in europe . 
  the result ? 
  everyone watches porn but is far less stupid about it ... 
  literally , teenagers are discovering sexuality and are often stupid , just because you tell them not to it does n't mean they will listen . 
  by imposing restrictions on ** everyone ** you 're screwing every single actual payer for a teeny tiny problem . 
   the government ? 
  fuck listening to the citizens , right ? 
  do * the people of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland * want this ? 
  ... you * are * aware that the eu , because we can fully pool our research resources , is by far the world 's most efficient research and development massive centre when it comes to scientifical development , right ? 
   i visited pakistan before and all porn was banned there . 
  even western porn from obscure sites . 
  not at all the same experience then . 
  he lived there and had access to most of anything ; the main issue was actual services that are n't readily available . 
   i was n't necessarily agreeing with those restrictions , just speaking from their pov . 
  i have mixed feelings about this . 
  while i 'm against porn , i do n't think that banning it is necessary . 
  imposing restrictions may be better than banning it , but i think we should instead work to talk about the harms of porn and discourage people from watching it in their adolescence . 
  so imposing restrictions that will not at all stop access from anyone , nor even their targets ( because , guess what , they are incredibly basic and easy to contour ) is the way to go ? 
  instead of educating the targeted over why they should n't watch porn ( which i think it 's a bit of a tired shitty debate ) as well as their parents to be responsible and guarantee a safer environment ... nope !, 
  let 's make the internet shittier for every single paying uk resident !, 
  you also said `` from * their * pov '' ... whose ? 
  who in the uk actually asked for this ? 
  do all americans fully have the same pov as the cheeto f\u00fchrer ? 
   where did you hear this ? 
  did you live there ? 
  i 'm sure all porn would be banned there . 
  no , though my neighbor did ( for 4 years ) and he was pretty much informed over it ( as you 'd probably guess a belgian very used to porn would be ) . 
  i 've asked about him , and he showed me how it all worked . 
   that may be kinda true , but those restrictions at least make porn harder to access . 
  so better than nothing . 
  imposing restrictions is now a good thing ? 
  what 's next ? 
  worked wonders last time . 
  good job !, 
  hope to see you around in france !, 
   i 'm sure most europeans can still remember a time when a lower middle class worker could rent or buy a 2 bedroom flat at market rate without having to work more than 35-40 hours a week or hope mom and dad can chip in ... aka modern day netherlands . 
  you can very much do so , that is n't gone at all . 
  we do n't `` remember '' it , we * live * it . 
  well , that explains it . 
  i think that although existent , sexism is a * far * lower issue in europe than in the rest of the planet , and maybe as time progresses and stereotypes become less and less applied ; perhaps men and women will basically be more evenly distributed in different fields . 
  ** ehm excuse you but i have to place you under arrest and take you to the international court of justice in the hague for crimes against humanity ; that burn was faaaaar too savage . 
  the ksa banned the biggest ones * over there * and suddenly as they 've done so traffic towards other western and far-eastern websites has grown ... makes you think does n't it ? 
  look at the case of ukraine and belarus where the same `` regulations '' exist and what happend ? 
  everyone just started using different websites or very self-evident contour methods ; including just watching and uploading tonnes of it to other websites such as vk or even some twitter private accounts , or closed facebook groups etc. . . porn flows even with these restrictions put in place ; and not only that there 's even tonnes of porn coming * from * places who banned it . 
  so you believe that the uk will go full-ham , like , say , saudi arabia ; which itself has not managed to ban some of the main porn websites to begin with nor even * begin * to address multiple ways to contour it . 
  furthermore , since your own definition of a porn website excludes tonnes of others , porn still remains ** highly ** unregulated by your own definition . 
  vk has tonnes of unprotected porn and you do n't even need an account ; so should it be locked ? 
  who decides which ones then ? 
  is this not subjective ? 
  if i see a foot fetish website and all i see is feet , is it porn or not ? 
  furthermore , why do you believe that they will only target the biggest websites ? 
  if so , is n't it redundant to begin with ? 
  because for every `` main '' porn website there are thousands if not millions of alternatives ? 
  alright so anything * not * video-based is fine ? 
  time to stock up on hardcore redhead deepthroat gif collections , whatever turns on the brits . 
  again , if i have videos with anyone naked in them , is it porn ? 
  in that case half the american pie films are porn , and any tv show that has ever shown a titty is porn . 
  because it 's a video . 
  what if people are n't even naked ? 
  what if there 's sexy people in fetish gear that covers up their privates spanking each other ? 
  you provided a very crass and unfitting definition of what porn is to begin with , as well as ** how much ** porn needs to be hosted by a website before it 's considered its main function ... 
  what exactly counts as porn then ? 
  if i have a website about nudism , no sex , just naked people playing tennis or whatever ; is it porn ? 
  what is the full definition of * porn * as opposed to just showing a nipple ? 
  if a website hosts primarily naked portraits , really damn sexy women painted into beautiful oil canvases , is that porn ? 
  what is the purpose of this ban if * any * other website , such as vk or even private accounts on twitter , can show as many genitalia-mashing videos as they please ? 
  do we need to check these too ? 
  where is the line between `` porn '' and `` not-porn '' and how much porn must a website host in order to be considered a `` mainly porn content '' holder ? 
  i 'm not complaining at all , nor even mentioning any complaints , i just think that it 's interesting to study different tendencies between men and women . 
  in europe we have a far less sexist society than most of the planet , a man can be a nurse and a woman can be a truck driver with less complications ; and though there are still some instances of sexism , i believe we have a great thing going here , all things considered . 
  [ apparently , in europe there are more females than males in every country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_sex_ratio ) still , it seems like women would mathematically be overrepresented . 
  perhaps this is due to difference access to the labor market ; whereas men usually are more willing to take construction working and other manual jobs that do not require a university education , women are less inclined to do so and decide to follow other courses , primarily related to care positions . 
  it 's a really interesting topic . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but are n't there proportionally more women than men in the world ? 
  i think that if such is true , then having more female students in uni seems pretty normal . 
  hence why there are negotiations to begin with . 
  yes david davis is an utter shitshow disaster , but there is not * one * person conducting the negotiations on each side ; there is more meaningful discussion even under the likes of bojo . 
  the case for eu citizen rights and uk citizen rights are still to be discussed , and so is this bill . 
  the sole thing we can do is wait and see what comes of these negotiations . 
  that is a ** lot ** of \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 . 
  well , give us a link and a good example . 
  is porn , in practice , really blocked in germany ? 
  absolutely not , you can easily find it online ; so what exact law are you talking about , and what does it do in practice ? 
  firstly the uk has already stated multiple times that ** it is ** leaving the single market ; hence why residency and working rights of eu citizens are a topic of discussion to begin with . 
  the uk also has announced that it ** will ** honor all financial responsibilities it has ; the sole thing is that these need to be discussed with the eu since obviously neither side wants to pay the full sum . 
  the uk will pay some , not all , and the eu will negotiate with the uk just how much of every single financial commitment can be applied to a * leaving * member state . 
  there 's literally nothing surprising about this . 
  but what exactly is a * porn * website ?
