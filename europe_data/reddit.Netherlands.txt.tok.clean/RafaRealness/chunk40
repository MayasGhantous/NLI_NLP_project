  technically vk is n't a porn website and there 's plenty of hardcore stuff there . 
  ... this is just another crappy article by the independent . 
  i 'm fully against brexit , but let 's not kid ourselves , the bill of 100 billion to be settled between the eu and the uk is still under negotiations . 
  the negotiations are n't `` halted '' they are just talking through what should be paid and what should not . 
  the eu aims for * everything * to be paid but hey , this is a negotiation , the eu has to give in to get the uk to agree . 
  negotiations for such a thing are slow , be patient , and * please * do n't take the independent as a good source . 
  i think not just england and wales , but distributed freely anywhere in the eez . 
  information should always be readily available , and this tiny sum-up of the eu is very well made . 
  factual and straight to the point with no faff around it , very nice for people to take their own opinion about the eu and have a better discussion about it . 
  that 's actually really interesting !, 
  when the plc named them all sorts of colorful \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c , why did they choose * those * colors for * those * directions ? 
  why is black for north , red for south , and white for west ? 
  also , are there any places in russia also named \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f ? 
  i mean , there 's a city named `` new siberian '' , so maybe . 
  me too , it 's quite weird but somewhat understandable to see that both independence movements have somewhat been `` hijacked '' by each side . 
  instead of an honest full debate , there 's just a shitfest of name-calling ... not really the * best * place to hold an important democratic choice . 
  [ is there though ? 
  * dutch fries / s, 
  well , although i participate in charities , i still think it 's not enough . 
  charities rely on the good will of others to correct the faults of our system ; so instead would it not be better to strive to have a system that guarantees that nobody is fully left for dead ? 
  i believe that , for example , senior citizens in the netherlands should have access to better healthcare prices concerning their insurances . 
  it really does n't to me , since it fits neatly one square like every other letter in the alphabet . 
  the tiddle of the i is n't , and l is a different letter . 
  check my comments and tell me with a straight face i do n't care about gay rights , specifically the ones about the state of homophobic discrimination in turkey , poland , romania , hungary , latvia , lithuania , and slovakia . 
  if you feel like this is me attacking you then my best guess is that you must be quite fragile . 
  i was calling it as i saw it , if you were interested in the debate of gay rights then why did you not comment on other threads related to the issue with the same vivacity ? 
  you 've mentioned gay conversion therapy as a relevant issue in europe . 
  and as it turns out it is n't , gay people in europe face * other * challenges , and one of them happen to be ** a gay purge in russia ** . 
  i 've stood for my own rights , and do n't flatter yourself , i do n't hate you , you 're not that important . 
  r is just a p with an extra line though , and a w is literally ( even by its name ) just two vs glued together . 
  i and j look very alike too , etc. . . 
  it 's its own letter , like \u0438 and \u0439 are different ones , and \u0435 and \u0451 . 
  sure they are similar and look eerily alike , but there is quite a lot of distinctions between the two , hence why they are n't just one letter to begin with . 
  there 's no `` cheating '' in alphabets , they are as they are . 
  otherwise there 'd be a huge linguistic war against even more complex alphabetical systems like arabic or thai have . 
  hello to you too i guess ? 
  edit : i just figured out what you were trying to say ( good day does n't translate into portuguese , that 's something you say to someone to say hello politely , basically `` good morning/afternoon '' ) . 
  on that note , arrivederci !, 
  well , yes , there 's been quite a few complicated cases in history . 
  recently i 've heard about a problem with luso-french citizens in angola . 
  usually portuguese citizens have different rights than french ones in angola ( cplp and such , helps out ) , the sole thing is that there was a huge shitfest when dual citizens started getting their rights revoked and treated as * just * french citizens ; which was also correct . 
  see the problem ? 
  exclusively in europe , there 's also problems regarding voting rights . 
  dual citizens get to vote ** twice ** essentially , because they have access to * two * national elections even as part of the diaspora ; italy had to take action against one of its own citizens over voting twice in the european elections based on his italian and austrian citizenship . 
  juridical and logistics problems keep piling up like this , and this is the ** big ** cases , usually the more common problems come in the form of taxes , registry , rights and duties , * what * laws to follow etc. . . 
  i 'm even lucky because being portuguese * and * french does n't pose as much trouble as if i were , say , from south korea , which is a country who judges that all its citizens must follow its laws , even abroad ... 
  problem is ** i can not ** just pick one because it would mean i 'd entirely lose important rights over my ageing family because legally if , say , my dad is at a hospital , as a non-citizen i lose some rights over his well-being . 
  i will also lose the right to heritage without paying a huge amount of taxes should one die , i 'd also even lose some rights over property protection should i hold real estate in these countries . 
  fair right ? 
  you nor i can be dutch , we have a fucked system that allows * some * to be dutch citizens without having to renounce to any and all citizenships they have yet not us . 
  it also discriminates between married and unmarried couples oddly enough . 
  dual citizenship poses * many * problems regarding non-eu immigration for portugal and france , and even the netherlands for those who * manage * to be dual citizens . 
  instead we should ditch this system and merely let families and propriety holders keep their respective rights * regarding these areas * without citizenship ( which as you know is often a burden ) . 
  i * want * to be a citizen of one place , but the fact is that i 'd have to renounce to rights over one or both my parents ; thus i ca n't * not * be a dual citizen because i 'm pretty damn divided in this case , and thus can not become a dutch citizen via naturalization and thus can never vote in a dutch election . 
  dual citizenship generates ** far ** too many problems for practical terms ( jumping between two or more civil registries for every damn thing ) as well as juridical problems ( if you commit a crime in one country and not in another how are you removed legally from the country of your citizenship towards the country of your other citizenship ? ) . 
  it is a messed up system that should seize to be and make way for a better mechanism to protect families across borders . 
  why is it that i 'm required to give up so much , but people from taiwan , tunisia , iraq , pakistan , etc. . . are n't being required to do the same at all ? 
  oh , are you a * dutch * dual citizen ? 
  guess what ? 
  you can not become one because you 're an * american * . 
  i am a dual french and portuguese citizen to maintain the same rights over my parents ** who happen to be in both countries and share no common citizenship ** , trust me that if i could i 'd already be dutch ; yet my grandparents became french and my mom 's kinda stuck with french citizenship too . 
  dutch citizenship is not meant to be dual but there are exceptions , especially exceptions made for arab countries which literally generates discrimination against all european , and nearly all american countries . 
  ** you nor i ** can ever be a dual dutch citizen , but an algerian can . 
  dual citizenship should not exist , instead there should be * one * citizenship per person or associate citizenship to keep key rights such as civil registry affairs , heritage claims , medical rights , etc. . . but * no * way to vote on both elections for example , nor to generate needless juridical complications by being asked to be repatriated by either side on claims not valid on another ( look at korean dual citizens in portugal ) . 
  the dutch government grants citizenship * and * demands you renounce to your previous one * unless * that country merely says `` no '' , so countries like iran or tunisia can have dutch dual citizens , but not portugal or france or anything ; via the naturalization process . 
  ok so we 've got russia , and belarus ( bielorussia ) and now we got malorussia , before we also had novorussia . 
  it really * is * like a matrioshka , just keep finding a smaller and smaller \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f each time . 
   dual citizenship is an absolute ass , and it makes the lives of dual citizens an absolute hell should they choose to get married , divorced , etc. . . or are ever accused of anything from either side . 
  ** yet arabs are able to have dual citizenship or have you not paid attention to the system ? 
  ** residency does not declare shit when it comes to recognition nor heritage , not even medical rights over one another . 
  dual citizenship * is * possible but it 's sketchy as fuck and generates discrimination against european nationals in favor of some asian and mena nationals . 
  you seem ** horribly ** misinformed about the inner workings of dutch citizenship , as well as the functioning of dual-citizenship in pratice . 
  i 'm both a portuguese and french citizen and trust me when i say it 's often an utter bitch to , for example , know my travel rights in countries that distinguish between portuguese and french citizens , or also civil registry matters . 
   rotherham i had to google what this was and i wish i did n't . 
  there was a similarly disgusting case in portugal a while ago ... 
   again , anarchism does n't mean `` no rules '' . 
  it means , among other things , no `` central government '' : societies structured around smaller , self-governed entities . 
  so anarchism means teeny tiny communities self-ruling ? 
  is n't that just prehistory ? 
  and do n't we benefit best by acting together as nations ? 
  what would happen to all our industries that only work due to the explicit agreement on common ground rules ? 
   an anarchist society is not the same as capitalist democracy without a police force . 
  even if your premise that you would be dead without the french police forces is true , it would n't mean that you 'd be dead in an anarchist society . 
  who would stop my attacker from killing me then ? 
  i was attacked because i 'm gay , it had nothing to do with a mugging . 
   look , you do n't know what anarchism is . 
  you can certainly dismiss anarchism if you want , you 're obviously entitled to , but in my opinion , dismissing things outright is rarely a good decision . 
  i know for sure i have found valuable insights in things i had previously dismissed ( anarchism , actually ; religion ; abstract art ; hell , even conuntry music ) . 
  i dismiss it because i do not see * any * possibility of it ever happening to begin with . 
  the great majority of people i 've met are against it and my university studies on modern history show that it just plainly is n't anywhere near from happening . 
  when it comes to politics i prefer focusing on what * can * happen , on what i can actually realistically worry about or look forward to ; not for example the rule of communism one day . 
  `` treat . 
  self '' are we doing random quotes now ? 
  tell him that french fries are n't belgian . 
  ** even ** my english style of writing is up for interpretation of my views on reddit nowadays , without checking what i actually believe in . 
  for me any and all crime must face justice , small or big , and punishment must be attributed to each accordingly . 
  do you think it 's fine to let * any * type of criminal get away untrialed ? 
   best would be to not help dictators steal billions of their population with dutch help . 
  stealing billions and giving back millions is not a fucking help .
