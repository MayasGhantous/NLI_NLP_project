  who says we are n't ? 
  what the hell ? 
  i do n't have to show respect to someone who is factually wrong and adds new information on a second comment . 
  you believe that dual citizenship is the future ? 
  so you agree that * some * people deserve more rights than others ? 
  including multiple voices for multiple elections ? 
  dual citizenship is an absolute ass , and it makes the lives of dual citizens an absolute hell should they choose to get married , divorced , etc. . . or are ever accused of anything from either side . 
  what * is * the best course of action is have a full respect towards immigrants who follow the law and customs of the country , as most do in the netherlands , and * should they want to be dutch instead of what they are * have a process to do so . 
  dual citizenship opens up gaps and problems that you have n't even begun to consider , nor have you even addressed the `` progressive '' case of portugal 's citizenship requirements that allow people to ** buy ** their way into it all willy nilly . 
  so much for `` progressive '' . 
  anarchists : proving the precise reason we need an organized government with a police force . 
  if you go over to the section about renouncing your current citizenship you can see the exceptions . 
  if you click on the country list of conservation of nationality you will find that great britain & northern ireland have written ( in dutch ) :  by being granted dutch citizenship , you do not automatically lose your british citizenship . 
  basically is required of you to give up your original nationality . 
  however , there are exceptions . 
  so for the uk it is n't possible , but for iran you 'll read this :  by being granted dutch citizenship , you do not automatically lose your iranian citizenship . 
  it is not possible for you to renounce your original nationality . 
  so due to this odd system , iranian citizens are allowed to be dual citizens , but brits are not , because iran does not allow for one to revoke its citizenship . 
  then there are other cases such as tunisia , tonga , taiwan , uruguay , syria , somalia , pakistan ( if under 21 years of age ) , morocco , mali , malaysia ( if under 21 years of age ) , libya , yemen , eritrea , dominican republic , costa rica , burkina faso , bangladesh , bahamas ( if under 21 years of age ) , argentina ( if born in argentina only ) and algeria . 
  note that some like fiji , iraq , and nauru are only required to do so since 2012 . 
  so if you are from any of these countries you are allowed to be a dutch dual citizen because it 's usually impossible for you to renounce your other citizenship . 
  but fuck you if you 're from a country who allows to do so then you can not be a dutch dual citizen at all . 
  the system also discriminates between citizens trying to * naturalize * ( since in nearly all cases you are required to renounce previous citizenships ) and * married couples with a dutch citizen * ( where you are not required to do so ) . 
  so the system is quite shoddy in its application to begin with , so either fully apply the rule of ** no ** dual citizenships or be fair and allow it for any other national under the same requirements . 
  as a portuguese person living in the netherlands . 
  you are incredibly wrong . 
  the netherlands hosts a far more open society than portugal , and even though dual citizenship is not really an open option as is in portugal ( aka the country that has problems with investment ways to achieve citizenship , as well as corrupt marriages to attain it too ) it does not mean that international talent is n't welcome in it . 
  pull your head out of your ass and see things for what they are . 
  do n't you tell me how to live out my bdsm fantasies . 
  nope !, 
  to be fair i hate the dutch government 's stance on dual citizenship since it 's hipocritical at best : got married to a foreigner ? 
  you and that foreigner can have dual citizenship with usually no problems !, 
  tried to naturalize after years in the netherlands as an adult ? 
  you can not have dual citizenship ** unless ** your home country makes renouncing your citizenship cost money , impossible , or similar cases ( morocco , algeria , eritrea , etc. . . ) in which case sure , have dual citizenship . 
  so countries who * are * very close to the netherlands politically , socially , and economically * can not * have dual citizens by naturalization , but other countries such as bloody somalia can . 
  no , it 's g ** \u00f6 ** tterfunken . 
  it has umlauts on it , otherwise it would n't be pronounced the same . 
   pork pie gibe . 
  i have n't seen them , i 'll keep an eye out for them then . 
  i 'm not sure what homosexuality has to do with european values , unfortunately homosexuality has been a reason of discrimination and even harassment for ages ; the sole difference is that at least in the west attitudes are evolving and in some cases it 's mostly a gone problem ( in the netherlands being gay is pretty meh , accepted and not really a mark of any kind ) . 
  well , i can beat you . 
  i am a portuguese polyglot who moved to france and obtained dual citizenship , then went on a trip to berlin to learn some german where i met a dutch friend . 
  then in high school i took up a british oib as well as italian , and then moved to the netherlands where i started studying russian and dutch , alongside with my lithuanian , swedish , serbian , romanian , polish etc. . . friends from uni ... ** and then ** we all went on a trip to the european institutions in brussels . 
  oh , and i also once joined a romanian protest against decriminalizing widespread corruption in amsterdam with a bulgarian , and we had some belgian beer with polish pierogi ** g \u00d6 t t e r f u n k e n **, 
  where ? 
  countries in * central * *** europe *** are not in europe , because they do n't share european values ? 
  i 've never heard this argument be used by anyone . 
  well , to be fully clear , although europe * is * often used as a synonym for the eu ; it also is a continent , and we ca n't really make poland and hungary physically move . 
  furthermore , they can argue they should * leave * the eu , as you said , but that means that they * are * europe . 
  so i do n't really think anyone would argue poland and hungary are n't in europe . 
  who do you have in mind ? 
  [ my reaction at this , \u00a1 d\u00edme que no !, 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c-ewqlzxgaaoupp.jpg ), 
  already underway , compare the world today to what it was before the stonewall riots in 1969 , and you 'll see that slowly there 's been great progression towards a world where gay people can exist peacefully and away from danger . 
  it 's still not the end of the problem , just like sexism and racism are unfortunate realities too still , but it still shows that slowly times advance towards the better . 
  so * this * is where all the fratboys come from ... 
  well , for me the democratic process of russia is horridly hindered by its own design and state , especially since there is * no * place for debate and in past elections the polls showed that ** around 120 % ** of people voted ... so for me i even have suspicions about the actual numbers . 
  even * if * the numbers are fully correct , i believe that a state with such heavy and clearly biased censorship and government-funded propaganda sources ; all at the hands of oligarchs who benefit from the system ; a state where dissidence or even different opinions and ideas are shunned ; is merely not the best place to uphold democracy . 
  north korea 's leader is also a democratically elected technically , the sole thing is that there is no dissidence , and there is no media who is allowed to say otherwise . 
  russia is the * far * less extreme version of it , but should you exaggerate the russian situation you 'd get essentially that . 
  by that basis , we can say that trump is a clear reflection of american nationalism , and theresa may is a clear reflection of british nationalism as well . 
  was he fully democratically elected ? 
  or instead were there elections with heavily biased media and censorship and also a clear destruction of opposing parties via alternative methods ? 
  well , reddit is a pass time for me , i do n't think i care for importance you should probably get on whatever it is needs doing . 
  yet would you say that a state where * information is highly manipulated * and * dissidence of any type is silenced * has any metrics or even any reliability for these cases ? 
  by these measures , north koreans are living the dream . 
  yet they are not investigated and even within the eu multiple countries allow neighbors to prosecute other neighbors for merely being two men or two women sharing a house ( mainly poland ) . 
  i believe that gays should be safe anywhere , without threat of violence or active discrimination , you on the other hand defend both sides saying `` we should n't attack you ! '', 
  but also say `` you should totally be discriminated against , because of a random criteria that has been scientifically proven is n't a choice '' . 
  i always saw it as a symbol of power and masculinity and violence . 
  to me , nazis glorified violence and robustness , the means they saw for survival of the `` superior race '' , so a man who could fight like an animal was often idealized . 
  shaving your hair makes you into that image of the superior violent and dangerous human , who can fight basically . 
  even though in my opinion in my opinion it 's just horrid since they just look like really angry chubby edgy kids . 
  because we do n't ? 
  we want to live free peaceful persona lives without fear of constant harassment , of police and judicial forces constantly against us , and to be treated with the same respect as every other human being . 
  meanwhile in russia , there 's a region actively trying to kills us all , and it 's been proven time and time again that even in moscow there are still active and even * violent * tensions against any display of affection between two people of the same sex . 
  again , why do gay people in countries such as poland , russia , belarus , etc. . . are treated like 2nd class citizens and have to live in fear of multiple actions , even with governments declaring anything considered homosexual `` propaganda '' . 
  yes , and do they ? 
  if so , why not ? 
  furthermore , is there discrimination against homosexuals in italy ? 
  compared to other western european countries , italy 's a pretty crass country concerning gay rights . 
  well , i live in amsterdam and i have n't ever really seen this happen . 
  furthermore i 've never seen a place in centrum with those posts , they do n't look a thing like the ones out on the streets , and the sidewalk is quite different too ; it looks a bit more like zuidoost or something afar , maybe noord . 
  i 've been out of there for 18 days now * what the fuck happened * ? 
  as an amsterdammer even i 'm confused . 
  firstly i 'm not sure * where * in amsterdam this is since we do n't tend to have those white poles ( we have custom ones with the usual xxx on it ) , so i 'm guessing it 's not at all anywhere near centrum . 
  secondly , i 'm not exactly sure what happened to the bike to begin with , other than it looks a mess . 
  not sure what the purpose of the photo is . 
  thirdly , this is a subreddit for europe , not individual countries , much less individual cities . 
  i think this would be more fitting ( if you give a bit more of an explanation too ) in r/amsterdam, 
  well , i 'm a nationalist too , and i agree with that view that every nation has a `` role '' in the world that it either was attributed by historical context or self-assigned ( there 's a fascinating book all about nation building by one of my former lecturers , joep leersen , i seriously recommend it ) however , do you believe that this russian role within the world is the same as being aware of its own destiny , and furthermore , due to the fact that the russian state keeps a * very * tight grip on the affairs of the nation , can we say that ** the nation ** is aware of its destiny , or is it merely guided ? 
  i 'd argue that there are similarities that are unfortunate but true between the clear differences among state and nation in russia . 
  it 's one of the big subjects i tend to look at , especially in the case of the countries in eastern europe that got the worse deals after communism ( moldova , russia , etc. . . ), 
   i 'll take your word for it , although if you only talk about subjects you actually know something about , you 're an unusual redditor . 
  i do n't but i know what subjects i am not as competent as others . 
  if someone who has a far more comprehension and contact about , say , racial tensions in the us ; then i 'll be * far * more inclined to hear what they have to say and assume what they say is right than fully debate on it . 
   the comment i was replying to was n't about putin vs navalny , but about russian cultural exceptionalism in a larger sense . 
  it 's something i like about russia regardless of politics . 
  so what would you describe as russian exceptionalism then ? 
  and how does it contrast from , say , czech , or romanian , or even kazakh exceptionalism ?
