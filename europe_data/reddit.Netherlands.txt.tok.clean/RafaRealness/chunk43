  furthermore , how does exceptionalism of a nation 's perception of itself and others relate to the idea of awareness of destiny ? 
   are you telling me that you do n't talk about american politics ? 
  and here we 're talking about russian politics . 
  are you russian ? 
  do you even speak russian ? 
  please , do n't pretend to be different in that regard . 
  i 'm majoring in eastern european studies with a specialization on soviet and russian history right now in the uva ... do you want proof of that , because i can easily provide some ? 
  i talk far less about american politics and culture because as you can probably guess it 's not my area of studies in the least . 
   for the sake of argument : no , imo . 
  so you are saying that the russian nation is * not * free , due to the fact that they are under a quite oppressive state . 
  so what makes you say that it is `` a nation to have an awareness of its own destiny '' ? 
  what is it to you that makes a huge propaganda empire like the one over the russian nation makes them `` aware of their destiny '' ? 
   you 're bringing nationality into it , and that 's ridiculous . 
  any american who 's lived in france or northern europe has had the experience of being lectured by ignorant people about his or her country 's politics . 
  have you done so then ? 
  meanwhile i 'm someone who even has french citizenship , represented france in ly2015 , and is pretty in touch with french cultural and political developments . 
   i did n't mean a literal king , any more than i meant putin was a literal \u043c\u0438\u0440 . 
  you 're choosing to argue about semantics instead of substance , probably just so you can keep arguing . 
  then address my point : due to the fact that the russian state is oppressive to any sort of dissidence as well as a shut-in case concerning foreign ideas , ** and also puts power away from its own peoples hand ** can you truly say the russian nation is free ? 
  you 've talked about `` oh but it 's their culture to take out dissidents !, 
  look at how it was centuries ago and during soviet times ! '', 
  without touching on the actual will of the russian ** nation ** . 
  you make little to absolutely no distinction between state and nation , hence the issue . 
   please , as if french people do n't do that constantly to americans . 
  because i did that to you ? 
  i did n't even mention americans to begin with . 
   pick at the details if you want , but macron is making a similar argument here . 
  french democracy is like that because of french history . 
  russian democracy is like this because of russian history . 
  pick details ? 
  * i literally went and read the actual interview question in its full extent , your article is the one who fully picked details * . 
  russian `` democracy '' is n't that democratic and you still have not proven to me that russians themselves are in control of their government as the dutch are in control of theirs . 
  they are at the claws of the oligarchs . 
  how come ? 
  i 've actually taken the time to read up on what he actually said , with context . 
  * in french because obviously in english it sounds far different * . 
  basically he said that democracy will always have an absent element , thus it 'll never be fully efficient nor perfect . 
  in the case of french democracy the missing element * right now * is coherence , a common focus , a somewhat `` discipline '' concerning political decisions taken democratically . 
  a `` king '' , aka , a uniting element that would provide said coherence by making france really come more together * socially and democratically * ( not talking about the already overly centralized government ) then french democracy would have one less problem . 
  in no way did he say we need a dude with a crown . 
  i find it ironic that you try to tell me what my president said , even though i 'm french and can easily call out bullshit on that . 
  good , i have nothing better to do . 
  so again , there is * no * place for evolution in your view of russian culture , even though it has changed throughout the years . 
  sounds to me like you do n't really have much of an argument , when you think that `` well they are shut in their own country and can not disagree and the state censors everything and generates propaganda , but really it 's their will !, 
  just look at how it was * centuries ago * ! '', 
  by the same logic , french people should still fully be okay with having a king , no ? 
  again , you suck at it as well . 
  so again , you believe that there is no place for dissidence , no place for * any * evolution in the least . 
  communism ended yet russia has n't seen a democratic boom as did other countries like for example czechia or estonia . 
  if russia would open itself to foreign medias , to even * internal * criticism ( aka ** stop killing the opposition and shutting down any medias that disagree ** ) then i have no doubts that russian society would evolve gravely . 
  also , the example you 've picked with \u043c\u0438\u0440 is widely gone nowadays considering the rural exodus that has taken place and how city life gravely changed the course of lives of tonnes of russians , and even russian culture itself , even during soviet times . 
   the question is `` why should they ? '' . 
  because they are capable loving parents and there are plenty of orphans that are deserving of a good stable family ? 
   you said you are gay . 
  anyway i think parents should n't divorce before their children reach adulthood what does it matter that i 'm gay ? 
  also , my parents divorced when i was 5 and it was * vastly * for the better . 
  split parents do n't get at each other 's throats and can better cooperate for the child 's best interests if both love it . 
   with harrassment i think of jokes , staring ect . 
  it 's obvious that physical violence is not tolerated nor justified . 
  there 's a ** big ** difference between jokes and active discrimination and harassment . 
  i get the occasional gay joke ( hell , sometimes i * make * them with friends ) . 
  those elements always exist when you introduce a new idea into the mix , just like when suddenly there were black people with equal rights in the us , there were grave and dangerous tensions , yet through * construcitve * and adaptive courses towards demythifying it . 
  same was done for other minorities , or even * women working * . 
   gays should n't be allowed to adopt at all why not ? 
  there 's plenty of gay couples who adopt here , it literally has n't ever been an issue and their kids are pretty average ...  if you are gay you should n't have children at all . 
  if you fake to be straight and you had children , you should let them to your ex wife . 
  bisexuals do n't exist ? 
  also why do you believe that people who are into the opposite sex are n't fit for children ? 
   i agree with this . 
  but i think homosexuals will always have to bear some harrassment . 
  ... except in places such as the netherlands or france or belgium where if you harass anyone , gay or not , you get full-on prosecuted quite efficiently . 
  countries where * the law works * . 
  i ca n't adopt because i 'm gay in certain countries , nor can i * keep my biological children * if i enter a gay relationship afterwards . 
  also , i am mainly talking about protections such as being able to be publicly gay ( something simple as holding hands ) without harassment , nor having a government who considers * anything * considered homosexual to be `` propaganda '' . 
  soooo i guess that any russian who does not agree automatically is not a russian ? 
  if that is the case , would you consider those who voted against abortion in portugal to be unportuguese ? 
  due to the fact that they disagree with the standard ? 
  also , do cultures not change ? 
  does russia even * bothered * to have any surveys about this that are trustworty , or instead do we have a biased ** state ** that entirely banned anything even * considered * homosexual in the basis of propaganda ? 
  does n't sound like part of russian culture when there is no metrics on the issue that the government is willing to use . 
  as an amsterdammer who saw the dutch flag : ** suck it everyone else **, 
  again , you miss my point . 
  ** the nation ** is not being heard within the halls of the russian ** government ** , who is the one who actually makes decisions and takes actions that promote further discrimination and even human rights abuses of gay people . 
  should russia actually be a full democratic state without a devastating media and and censorship status , then you 'd be right . 
  the nation has n't conformed with anything , they are just doing as told . 
  so let 's say that canada has a referendum to just kill all inuits , is it fully okay ? 
  also , you have yet to address my arguments about the russian government 's treatment of medias , attacks , and elections , that * take away * the voice of the ** nation ** . 
  yet you 're still saying `` i do n't agree with it but alright '' then . 
  you said that russia is `` a nation aware of its destiny '' which already echoes what * literally nazi germany * said about itself to begin with . 
  i provided arguments about how the russian * government * is far overreaching , manipulative , and undemocratic , thus not giving the russian nation ( aka the actual people , not the state ) their own voice and their own opinions . 
  so am i , being gay does n't change much in my eyes . 
  you say it 's perfectly fine for russia to keep what it 's doing , which involves crass discrimination , because `` it 's a nation 's destiny '' . 
  so exactly * what * are you saying ? 
  it 's fully okay for chechnya to kill us too , right ? 
  destiny and such . 
  so do you think that the 7 500 000 gay people in russia , a number higher than the entire population of slovakia , * should * be entirely regarded as second-class citizens where civils harass them , the police force does next to nothing ( and sometimes even beats them too ) and where * any * dissidence against this status quo or even display of anything considered homosexual is banned and considered propaganda ? 
  i am talking about ** not getting beaten nor killed ** as its written in the echr which russia keeps grandly violating in relation to its homosexual minority , even after signing it . 
   fellow nationalist soooo neo-nazis are what you call fellow nationalists ? 
  says much about you . 
   they have all the right like the rest of non-homo people excluding does related to children and marriage .
