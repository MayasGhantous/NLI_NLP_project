  why though ? 
  what should be done with bisexuals who have kids and now date someone of the same gender ? 
  what should we do then ? 
   marriage is is determined and defined by the state and thus a state like russia which has conservative views about it , and is not obliged to give that right to gays . 
  not that right but how about * not allowing a region to execute us all willy nilly , as well as a police force who harasses us and does absolutely nothing to ensure our safety * ? 
   but i dont understand why would they have to have rights that nature doesnt allow them nor do their biological bodies like having children - adoption ? 
  fuck cancer patients , why should they live ? 
  also , adoption should be illegal , since nature said that a couple ca n't have kids . 
   lets face it is was and some still consider it a mental disease , you are free to believe otherwise . 
  yet we 're attacked and harassed but someone with 3 chromosomes is n't ? 
  also , by what metrics is homosexuality a disease ? 
  it was widely debunked in the 70s already , and consider that hysteria was also once a disease too , now women are free to be themselves in europe and disagree with men . 
  homosexuality is called a disease in non scientific basis , so if your argument is that * it 's probably a disease * then explain how exactly it 's a disease and why carriers of this `` disease '' should constantly be treated like they are in russia instead of other sickly people like diabetics . 
  explain to me why exactly gay people deserve less rights , and even get their human rights violated often , than heterosexual people . 
  well , this shows how far your humour goes then . 
  so are bulgarians , do you not deserve rights should you * happen * to be bulgarian ? 
  tell me why i deserve to get shunned and harassed by civils and police forces alike , and even * executed * in a region ; merely because i 'm gay ? 
  that 's not the topic of this comment . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6nn3ur/russia_where_homosexuality_is_still_a_disease/dkaql2j/ ) is you claimed that russians are a nation that has awareness of its own destiny and i provided arguments that show how wrong you are . 
  now you slither away and also mention elsewhere in this thread how apparently trying to get russia to stop violating human rights is somehow a cultural colonization . 
  we sure colonized the fuck out of nazi germany then , should have left them killing jews and whatnot , after all , it was destiny ? 
   witty humor it was as humouristic as a 12 year-old shouting your username in middle school , u/whatsubitchez, 
  `` a sense of its own destiny '' means living in a state such as russia , where elections are fucked beyond belief , opposition is severely attacked , and pretty much everything is at the hands of oligarchs ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that russians would disagree a * lot * with shite their government tries to do such as for example the huge middle finger they gave to the people of \u041c\u0430\u044f\u043a , or the constant censorship it has + state funded propaganda , etc. . . 
   some filthy provincials like me . 
  ... well , i did . 
  * there are multiple ways to do that . 
  do you mean \u042b ? 
  \u042b and \u042c are two very different things . 
  one is a vowel , the other is an accent . 
  \u042b is a common ending for a lot of nouns in plural nominative and other grammatical cases . 
  \u0428\u0443\u0431\u044b means `` fur coats '' in russian , its * singular * nominative form being \u0448\u0443\u0431\u0430 . 
  in bulgarian it makes sense because it has a sound , but in russian the \u042a has no sound of its own , instead it makes whatever sound that precedes it into a hard sound ( as opposed to \u042c which makes it a soft sound ) . 
  the \u042a itself is already very rare in russian since it 's barely used and really somewhat sticks out as a relic of a past form of the language rather than a fully useful element . 
  [ obligatory dance-along song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bookp974b0k ), 
  well , bulgarian uses cyrillic * very * differently , for example , the bulgarian \u044a actually has a sound ( hence why it 's called \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f in their language ) . 
  in fact , in bulgarian , there are not even stress patterns , whereas in russian there are and * by god * they matter . 
  ... i 'm pretty damn certain this is n't news in the least though . 
  the uk already made several mentions that it would follow through with its financial obligations , the sole thing is that it would discuss * how much * would be covered . 
  well you somehow also put a \u044c instead of a \u043e after the \u0442 . 
  in russian transliteration remember that 99 % of all ws get transliterated into \u0412s and vice versa , and that even though we have a more appropriate \u042d , the \u0415 still is the main transliteration of the letter e ( they look the exact same ) . 
  there 's no such thing as australian nationalism , they 're just prison riots !, 
  well , what you consider `` easy '' basics can actually be quite chaotic for others . 
  keep in mind that german vocabulary is radically different from romance , or slavic languages ; as is nuance . 
  word order is a fucked subject too , etc. . . sure , it may seem easy to someone who already speaks a germanic language ( maybe except english due to its degree of difference ) to learn german , but for someone who has no experience it 'll be difficult . 
  for example : me and my polish friend both are learning russian , for him it 's far easier since he gets the slavic etymology and is very much more used to the case system and such ; whereas i 'm not and struggle considerably more . 
  however , when we both learned italian , for me it was near-instant since for me it was * far * closer to what i consider obvious and easy , whereas he struggled with a lot of it . 
  there 's no `` easy '' in languages , what 's normal for the spider is hell for the fly . 
  it comes from lusitania , which is considered to be the first ever iteration of portugal ; the national myth of origin of portugal is deeply connected to it . 
  similarly , a portuguese speaker is called as lusophone !, 
  as someone in portugal right now : ** i 'm too hooot ** ( goddamn ), 
  i 'm a luso-french polyglot living in the netherlands with a slight boner for linguistics , it 's my cocaine . 
   german is deeply not fun . 
  you 'd be surprised actually , one of the ( arguably ) hardest things about german is the articles , and they function very similarly to the ones in portuguese ( o/a , do/da , no/na , etc. . . ) just with some alteration . 
   if you can actually afford to live there comfortably * bruh *  if money was no object ** bruh ** the article says that , yes , london is awesome , but it 's * way * too damn expensive and thus berlin , which is still the eu 's second largest city , is also really awesome * but actually affordable * . 
   \u042e\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0442\u044a\u043d \u0414\u0421 * what the fuck is yuashingt ` n ? 
  i mean , sure , if that 's the way you feel . 
  but can he be treated * and * be in prison ? 
  or would he just be in a hospital room , that happens to be in prison ? 
  is it really that better ? 
  you 're allowing him to basically kill off time in comfort . 
  i want him to be fully able to suffer the punishment judged correct for him . 
  again , do you want to kill the murderer and become one yourself ? 
  i want him to get better , and then fully face justice and serve his sentence ; without being able to use his disease as essentially a pause button . 
  okay it 's really weird , i looked at the amsterdam one and i was like `` wait a minute i know exactly where that is '' . 
  hats off to you , you did an impeccable job with all of them , keep it up !, 
  yes , but you do n't have the same exact treatment as you have in the outside , furthermore a ** pregnant lady ** in prison is a huge risk for security and health even with the best of healthcare right there and then . 
  prison generates discomfort ( as it is supposed to ) , the problem is that this can heavily rile up your pre-existent health issues should you already have some . 
  it is best for him to cure himself first , then face justice and serve his full sentence to the minute , rather than an on-off situation because he keeps requiring medial assistance . 
  what does that even change ? 
  portugal is half surrounded by water , are they half malta or something ? 
  japan 's a bunch of islands , and so is the philippines , and taiwan , etc. . . what the heck does being an island change any fact that vassallo is a nationalist ? 
  albania is a tiny nation in a tiny place too ... your point ? 
  do we need to be huge in numbers and territory like china or something ? 
  he 's an antisemitic dirty greedy jew !, 
  he ca n't be trusted !, 
  so we should kill them or something ? 
  i mean , sure it sucks , but i 'm not gon na pretend that it 's sane to just prosecute someone who needs medical care ( afterwards , sure though ) nor to punish a pregnant woman and possibly wreck her baby 's life . 
  wait until their unfinished business is done with ( he 's back in health , her kid is in a stable and safe situation with a good life ) and * then * make them face justice . 
  why not , alternatively , let them seek treatment and birth & take care of their son/daughter for the early years ? 
  and * then * prosecute them accordingly to guarantee their health , as well as the full support and innocence of their child ? 
  for not being land . 
  * we need to fix that * . 
  also , it 's a wet sadistic bastard who occasionally drowns us . 
  ** damn fucking right ** ** suck it finlaaaand **, 
  if poland can not into space , poland * will become * space . 
  ** l i t. **, 
  an extreme hatred and will to utterly abolish and dominate the sea . 
  ** fear us **, 
  sooo you * want * to send a sick man and a pregnant woman to jail ? 
  from what i can read , they both had peculiar reasons not to be detained ; and if you want new zealand to get pissed again over it , go right ahead , but the fact is that the world moved on and france and new zealand now have good and warm ties again . 
  spain still claims olivenza/oliven \u00e7a , breaching a treaty made centuries ago ; should portugal and spain still hate each other like the good ol' days , or move on and be cooperative towards each other ? 
  thank hell for that . 
  i 'm actually pretty sad to see such a party in europe , what in the everlasting hell happened to us ? 
  we got islam and denk what in the ... as if the * regular * idiots were n't enough ? 
  still , 2 % in brussels is already far more than what i 'd consider acceptable for * a frigging party whose main goal is to make belgium and islamic state * . 
  it boggles my mind how such a thing is even * legal * considering what salafism defends . 
  how popular are they ? 
  already done and dealt with in the late 80s . 
  france admitted it acted like a huge dick , compensated the victims , and the world moved on .
