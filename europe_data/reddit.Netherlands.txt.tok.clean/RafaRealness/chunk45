  people also voted for hitler , remember ? 
  quite literally the naziest of them all . 
  furthermore , they got far lower scores in the legislative votes and lepen * severely * watered down her plans from the first round and participated * not * as a part of the fn but as an independent candidate . 
  first time i 've ever heard of either . 
  what the heck is that party ? 
  is it your version of denk ? 
  i am a portuguese dude , who moved to france and lived there for a few long years and became a french dual citizen ; and now is living happily in the netherlands . 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't think there 's any way to make an * original * francophone speak dutch ( we even barely make them speak english ! ), 
  so you 're saying that * your * view is abnormal . 
  also you are saying that your views would have very clearly ** no ** public support ? 
  keep burying yourself . 
  * sure * keep telling yourself that . 
  islam is n't a party , it 's a religion ; and i ca n't nor would vote for it . 
  do you know * any * french citizen who `` voted '' for islam somehow ? 
   just like you and people from greece . 
  it means nothing . 
  i care for people from greece because i directly am in contact , plus they are part of the union , if they fall hard the rest of us fall a bit as well . 
   lol , and how does it look like ? 
  100 % of them should ask ? 
  or 70 % or 50 % +1 ? 
  and what if 49 % will ask ? 
  actual movements of substantial and clear-cut arguments as to why a general population needs help , and how we can best help them without compromising our best interests . 
   why not go further ? 
  why not the interests of your city ? 
  or your street ? 
  i already do , i respect my country and the eu as well as their laws , if i want to vote for a mayor that will make my city far better but piss off a neighboring one , so be it . 
  i care for the greater good of those closer to me . 
   it 's just this opinion is slightly ahead of time . 
  this is why you think it is an utopia . 
  same thing was said about fascism when it was around , as well as communism . 
  are you going to play the pretentious hipster card of `` i 'm just avant-guarde '' for this ? 
  i see * no * value nor even europe 's competence to interfere in african education at all ; it would cause even more disasters than solve them and you just sound like a person who refuses reality , and blinds himself with high-horse ideals that are grossly misapplied . 
  ... i 'm a french citizen , and for me the fn is just a dangerous party with little to no constructive plans and instead a destructive agenda that openly wants to go against my liberties , and also others ' freedoms like women ( shocking , right ? ) . 
  they make a mockery of french political history as well as culture . 
  claim symbols like jeanne d'arc and misuse them constantly for devious purposes . 
  they represent ** none ** of our 3 core values : libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 . 
  africa does n't belong to me and the netherlands does n't belong to them . 
  what kind of communist utopia do you believe in ? 
  we live in different places and though we can cooperate it does not at all mean that europe * has * to impose its values and morals anywhere else than in europe . 
  leave them be unless they genuinely * ask us * for help ; then we 'll see what we can be done . 
  under absolutely ** no ** circumstances would i ever put their interests in front of the interests of europeans , or the interests of the netherlands . 
  also , are you seriously going to ignore everything else i 've said ? 
  sounds like you merely have no arguments to me . 
   unless you were referring to the extreme right i mean ... 
  the fn is the extreme right of france , not really * just * the right-wing . 
   because it is reasonable , right and good . 
  no , it is n't . 
  why is * our * education better than africa 's ? 
  why are * we * superior and must impose our ways on them ? 
  unless they are counting on migrating here , i do n't believe it is right nor good for us to intervene unless specifically asked . 
   nobody says that you need to control africa * just * education then ? 
   create fund , that would make some place on the continent more attractive and easily approachable , so that people were trying to migrate there , instead of europe . 
  i shopping spree for all those crazy dictators it seems . 
  there are very attractive places in africa already , but they are not accessible for everyone . 
  look at agola where a fuck tonne of the population is poor and in constant want for basic needs , yet they have an amazing city to move to : luanda ... so why do n't they just move there ? 
  he might as well be our ambassador at this point . 
  well , if everyone followed that mentality , who gives two shits about anyone to begin with ? 
  why is there an eu ? 
  in fact , why do i care about other people in my country ? 
  what did groningen and friesland ever done for me ? 
  or the rest of north holland for that matter . 
  fuck zeeland , if they drown , why not just let them ? 
  not my problem , i do n't care . 
  see how that works out ? 
   you need to integrate africa and the rest of the world and educate it . 
  why is it our responsibility to `` integrate '' the world ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  if anything that sounds like colonialism to me ...  otherwise you 'll have a problems . 
  * yes , sure , i very much miss the times where most of africa was under european control and terrorism was so much lower , it 's not like anything even happened between algeria and france for example *, 
  allow me to repeat that for you with one slight change :  look at the names : `` david , abraham , batsheva , leeba , haskel , elior , dudel '' let 's be honest guys i think they had good reasons to execute them . 
  if you think that because of a name you were given you deserve to die , you 're no better than some of the darkest hours of european history . 
  not to mention , the ones killing random people * are muslim extremists * . 
  so are you saying that they are right ? 
  makes sense if these regions together form a more accurate representation on the inner statistics of croatia . 
  will this change administration in any way ? 
  i 'd imagine not . 
   lgbt lunacy what do you mean by this ? 
  what should the 5 statistical regions be ? 
  my experience is the entire opposite . 
  in portugal i got literally beaten by a known cunt right in front of my school , the police did nothing ; in france me and my mom got constant threats by our neighbor and vandalism , the police did nothing ; meanwhile in the netherlands , every time i 've needed the police they 've been there and have always solved the problems , be it my neighbor trying to break into my house or a dude trying to steal from me in a metro station . 
  statistically this is true as well , the netherlands has a * very * low crime rate compared to the rest of the world , and to say that our police is useless sounds like something entirely lacking evidence . 
  ... or we happen to be a country with ways to host prostitution and weed consumption in ways that do n't get procecuted by the law unnecessarily . 
  we 're also one of the safest countries in the world , is our police * really * that much of a joke or is our country genuinely just safe overall ? 
  i feel like trump bought a dictionary and started highlighting words that can be used instead of `` very good '' or `` very bad '' to try and seduce the international community . 
  i mean , last time i saw the guy on tv he was condemning north korea for `` acting very very badly '' so yeah ... 
  i do n't know , his vocabulary just sometimes seems awkward as all hell to me , for a president . 
  is somehow having * more * prisoners in your country per 100 000 people a * good * thing ? 
  if so , europe sucks and seychelles is the most amazing place ever in this reign . 
  * shut up you finn , we 'll beat you next time , grumble grumble grumble * in all seriousness i was surprised to see such a big difference between germany and czechia , and the baltics need to chill the fuck down . 
  * vaguely shakes fist at finland grumbling *, 
  `` not turkey '' ^ / s, 
  yeah , his actions were all reich . 
  german . 
  he ca n't help it . 
  * woosh *, 
  well , this shows how much you know about the irish case of opposition . 
  the roi had a problem with * one * detail regarding their military neutrality in conflict , which parts of the treaty of lisbon were ambiguous towards and could potentially endager that . 
  that is why the referendum failed in ireland . 
  then they just contacted the roi to write down the precise clauses that ireland judged fair to make way for their military neutrality to be guaranteed . 
  with this done , a second referendum was passed and ireland accepted the treaty of lisbon .
