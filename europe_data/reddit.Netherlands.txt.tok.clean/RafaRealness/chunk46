  so it was not just repeated , they literally listened to the problems and demands from ireland and seeked to solve them . 
  ... i fail to see the logic behind it ? 
  ah , understood . 
  i think that nowadays we have so many idiots that even on reddit we need previously very obvious '' / s `` s everywhere, 
  the whole point of charlie hebdo is that they are crude , horridly bad , and offensive . 
  yes you may not like it , but are you going to be the one to pick up guns and go against freedom of expression ? 
  they 're a crude joke magazine that offends a fuck tonne , what is there for them to make up their mind about ? 
  remember that one time judas and jesus kissed ? 
  or how he hung out with tonnes of prostitutes and stuff ? 
  i think that we 's got more experience with european matters , and political culture definitely has seen its share of change due to it . 
  if the same would happen to ee , i think that what would happen is that both would still fully defend their best and particular interests in a similar fashion as to not deteriorate what took decades to build , but also be strong in their stances . 
  it takes time to adjust to the whole `` european idea '' and it 's not just politicians , nations too . 
  when portugal and spain first joined they were somewhat plagued by similar problems . 
  i think it is often ignored when it 's beneficial to be ignored . 
  by that i mean they very much would like to ignore eastern particularities that object their goals ; but not when they can take a profit from it ( such as scapegoating ) . 
  if the czech republic would just have said `` i 'm not signing it '' and stuck to it , then the treaty would have stopped . 
  ** all ** treaties require all member states to ratify them , and the fact that czechia was among the last to ratify it changes absolutely nothing ; it still signed and supported by the czech government . 
  you have the same exact say , if you 're unsatisfied , vote for people who will do a better job at representing your interests and do n't blame your dissatisfaction on your government on the eu . 
  i think that there definitely is a big gap between we and ee that most people tend to ignore and treat as a thing of the past , but the truth is that you ca n't really just eliminate differences that were solidly put in place for whole decades . 
  i remember seeing footage of the people jiggling their keys in prague and dubcek at the balcony sending out hugs and kisses and inside i was just being a happy fanboy like `` yaaaas bitch yasss slaaaay '', 
  well , i 'd say it 's a 3-part structure : we * do * learn the overall eu geopolitical and economic context , that 's part 1 and it 's usually my personal favorite . 
  note that this also includes * part * of the general bigger eu institution and legislative procedures ( not a lot , just significant big changes , such as the sea ) . 
  part 2 is mainly the exact legislative procedures and their evolution ( we also study what they were in the * past * and why they changed ) . 
  this also often includes more institutions and is more in-depth as to how the eu exactly works . 
  when it comes , however , to eu agricultural subsidies or eu cohesion funds , we know * generally * how they work as well as their limits , however we tend to make research on a case-by-case basis . 
  part 3 is * not * about the eu but my god it goes ignored sometimes : history and culture . 
  we are taught the general cultural and geopolitical history of europe to better understand the context and our own current state . 
  we 've also focused on the case of eastern europe to understand its economic and social position ( such as the place of religion in poland ) and also its perspective . 
  side-note : the velvet revolution was my favorite thing ever fuck yeah czechia and slovakia . 
  is there any way in poland that pis could either stop being in power or being held accountable for finding a solution ? 
  the scheme was ill-designed from the get-go and the commission is too proud to admit it to themselves in my opinion . 
  there should , in my opinion , be transparent and public talks to come up with a solution that works out for * all * member states . 
  i sure as fuck do n't want to see another member state leave the eu ( unless , really , that 's what it wants ) . 
  it 's * very * variable , in france ( where i had civic education ) it is merely touched upon lightly , and it is often about how france acts in it ( and not a lot about how the eu works ) . 
   sorry , an unrelated question . 
  since you study european affairs , would you say you have a throurough understanding of the way eu operates , would you say you understand all the aspects of its policies and are able to make informed decisions ? 
  depends on * what * decision . 
  i can not , for example , say what is best or worst for every single particular municipality or member state , but i * can * make more informed decisions at an eu-level . 
  you have knowledge about * the eu * and its place in the international economic context ; but to fully apply that knowledge to member states or more particular cases , you also need to do lots of research on the matter at hand ( we do this * very * often , just recently i wrote a thesis on censorship laws in germany and its effects on the common market ), 
  yeah i 've heard , pis goes to some extreme lengths to do so . 
  i 'm not even sure if there * is * a resolution to the problem . 
  i agree , i think it was a pretty bad idea from the get-go ; and that other measures ( such as border-guarding support coordination for the mediterranean and more severe measures on boat rejection ) should have , and still should be taken . 
   you actually nowadays have people taking their bachelor and master degrees purely in european affairs , this is how incredibly complex the eu is at this point . 
  * i mean , i am one so yes . 
  * i agree that there are far too many complex facettes to every single issue ; but there is still a ** massive ** amount of key facts that are not properly being discussed . 
  for example , i believe that the actual rights refugees get in the eu should be information more well distributed to promote debate and in case of disagreement push for change ( like allowing refugees to just move to richer mss after being let in in poorer mss like portugal , slovenia , lithuania ... ), 
  i think that there is a * huge * unpopular factor attributed to taking these migrants in ; in reality sure it makes probably not much of a difference if they take them in and spread them out carefully , but the fact they * did * take them in will be the thing that matters . 
  at this point it could be * one * refugee and it would matter in terms of popularity . 
  this perfectly fits the efta , so i 'd guess it 's the best course . 
  what is the ideal union for ee ? 
  i believe that there are key basics about the eu 's functioning ( knowing what the commission , councils , and parliament do ) that should be explained ; furthermore if there is one very pressing issue ( ie the migrant crisis ) it should be fully explained to the general public so voters can make an informed decision in regard to the eu ( be it for or against it ) . 
  yes , and they were , and still are today ; however the reforms required in the regulative and political sectors clearly show that the eu had wider effects than just economic cooperation . 
  i agree that we has definitely an ego problem , and that sometimes ee gets a shittier deal ; however if truly the will of lithuania ( in your case ) and its voters is to have trading yet funding is n't really a huge thing ; i believe that perhaps the efta is more fitting . 
  i do n't want to keep member states in a union they do n't believe in , it is better to have a cooperative relationship than a deconstructive siamese situation, 
  well nor did most of the west ; sweden and germany do n't hold anything close to a majority when it comes to a say in european affairs , especially at eu level . 
  that being said , it allows for the ones who have n't adopted an open-door policy to retract and figure out a solution that works out best ; even if sweden and germany disagree . 
  this * also * means that the migrant quotas have to go since a pretty hefty majority of europe disagrees with it entirely . 
  for me it seems like if * all * member states had better mechanisms to inform the general population over what the eu is , how it functions , etc. . . a tonne of problems could be solved far more quickly . 
  the problem is that the * second * that would be attempted ( like , say , a pro-eu campaign , or eu info centres , etc. . . ) it would be shunned as propaganda . 
  so because somehow most people were not fully informed about the eu 's goals and already changing character ; now it 's considered `` hidden in fine print '' ? 
  this , again , seems more like a sad stereotype of eastern europe wanting trade and funds , without putting in their share of efforts and integrate within the union as do their other counterparts . 
  whose fault is it that over there the eu was only partially portrayed ? 
  so you blame this on misinformation by your side before you joined ? 
  not to mention , the lisbon treaty ** had ** to be ratified and implemented by all member states in order to pass . 
  does eastern europe just agree to shit without being properly informed then ? 
  the refugee system * does * suck and there is absolutely no question that it 's got ta go ; but to say that `` oh we did n't know ! '', 
  and then blame the eu for it seems like blaming the butcher because you burned your steak . 
  same goes for the lisbon treaty that ** all our governments ** have signed and ratified . 
  i 'm going to need a few more details to know what you mean . 
  what exactly did you expect from `` an ever-closer union '' though ? 
  i agree that the migrant quotas system sucks and should not at all be implemented ; however to say that eastern europe was not aware that 2004 's eu was much more than just economic partnership seems * very * disingenuous to me . 
  not to mention , in 2004 we already had an eu with competences that did not at all revolve around economic cooperation ... so again , what was so hidden ? 
   probably should n't have hidden it in fine print ... 
  it was n't very hidden , to be fair . 
  especially considering how many obligations at an institutional level all new member states have had to satisfy before being granted membership . 
  ** the laaaaand of the freeeeeeee ** * inhale * ** and the hoooooooooooooome of theeeeeeeeeee braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaave **, 
  well , thank hell you 're not in it . 
  well , i see that as a good thing . 
  why would we want a company like that ? 
   if it would stop muslim immigration ? 
  yes . 
  considering that no member state has a muslim majority and as a non-eu citizen , even if you are granted residency in , say , germany , you are not allowed to hold residency on another member state . 
  meaning that it would have no effect on muslim immigration . 
   who cares what the muslims will complain about . 
  hating on the west and their neighbors is the arab national sport . 
  ignore their impotent whine . 
  it 's not their whine i 'm worried about , it 's oil prices as well as further actions in the economic sectors . 
  if we want to have less immigration from muslim countries then the netherlands can not be alone ; and should such a decision be taken , i am very sure it would easily be followed by its western allies as they face similar issues . 
  one other thing we need to do is address the populations already within the netherlands that does not integrate . 
  there are dutch citizens , born and raised within the netherlands , that do n't even speak dutch due to the formation of parallel societies . 
  these must be entirely halted and dispersed ; integration is * not * optional for anyone . 
  waiting for a big hairy dude to come into the house and tell you [ ** yerr a wiza 'd harry ** ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/quiz/11/04/01/170002/media/203harry_open_mouth_getty.jpg ), 
  that 's subjective ( though i agree ) . 
  still , i still think that there is a ** big ** difference between calling a labour government `` coalition of chaos '' and calling it `` terrorist sympathizers '' . 
  `` coalition of chaos '' is what i 've heard ; from 0:32 onwards , not at all `` terrorist sympathizers '' . 
  i 've rewatched the whole video , she never actually said it ... 
  ... sooooo you 'd like to leave the eu ? 
  freedom of movement is a guaranteed right for all eu citizens . 
  this is extremely shortsighted as it ignores the population composition of the netherlands , and how immigration , though it generates problems , also corrects some severe deficits in the dutch labor market . 
  you * can * however make visas more restricted towards target populations ; which will make accusations against the netherlands over racism and discrimination grow , but it 'll reduce populations from target countries .
