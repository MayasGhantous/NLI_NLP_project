  neither of these say `` terrorist sympathizers '' though . 
  from what i could google , it was a ukip politician who has said that ( not farage , fraiser i think he was called ) . 
  was it may that said that ? 
  i thought it was someone else . 
  yeah , but we all know that danes are just closeted swedes with speech impediments . 
   the texas of turkey . 
  you get news of people throwing grenades at their mother-in-laws and shit from there . 
  ... i now want a reality show , maybe like cops , all just about this place . 
  ** again ** you entirely ignore everything i 've just said . 
  i have asked * two different lecturers * at the uva since a real-life professional is infinitely more trustworthy than * a reddit thread * . 
  they both agreed that , indeed , my usage and understanding of the word ` prevent ' is correct in this case . 
  thus far you have called me arrogant and even insinuated i 'm ignorant in english , whilst also ** entirely ** deflecting all other arguments regarding the article * you * brought up . 
  i have no time nor mind for petty and dare i say moronic people like you . 
  if you are going to keep criticizing my usage of the english language go right ahead , and feel free to comment on other threads too , since that does n't seem below you either . 
  i fully understand the word ` prevent ' and you know this fully well ; thus far you are * the * first person to ever question my level of fluency in english . 
  the first even among cambridge examiners and even british language and redaction lecturers ; a random guy on reddit who claims i do n't understand an article * even though * everyone else seems to disagree with him . 
  i do n't think you got the article wrong , what i * do * think is that you quoted an article that does not support your previous arguments ; you refuse to address the parts i directly quoted from the article and even explained to you ; and thus base your * entire * argumentation over my usage of * a word * again , is your argument * ever * going to address what i said about the article , even the parts that did not even include the word ` prevent ' ? 
  or are you going to keep on continuing a line of argumentation based on * the usage of a word * . 
  not only that , are you also going to childishly going to go back and comment on other threads i 've posted on , just out of spite as you 've done previously ? 
  yes , the article who talked about measures i directly quoted , that still mean the same exact thing i said , that you keep forgetting to come back to because * you are stuck in this line of argumentation based on nothing but my usage of a word * i 've seen american kkk extremists with better arguments than this . 
  for me this seems like a bit of a paradoxical situation , let me explain : we want a more efficient nhs . 
  the nhs is currently facing problems due to funding due to austerity measures . 
  the way out of austerity ? 
  a better economic situation , right ? 
  well , if this is the case ; based on your explanation of the nhs system and how it works ; would n't a reduced pool of contributors towards funding of the nhs result in an even more deteriorated situation ? 
  this is , after all , what immigration does : provide more workers that via their employment contribute to the british government 's funds through taxes . 
  is , thus , having less eu immigrants , who pay taxes and such and according to the nhs do not put an additional strain in the nhs , nor does health tourism , really the solution to the problem regarding nhs efficiency ? 
  so , again , the main concern that we 're discussing is nhs efficiency ( or , in this case , a perceived lack of efficiency ) . 
  you said that austerity measures are somewhat welcome among the british electorate generally ; which is fair enough ; but you said `` people would rather both taxes go down and the level of coverage remained the same '' how would this be possible then ? 
  there is no clear-cut solution here . 
  you have also addressed that the british people believe that the lack of british nurses is a sign of lack of investment in education ; which i fully agree with and i still believe this is a crucial issue in the uk being ignored often . 
  i still do n't understand one particular thing : you have talked about eu immigrants being a possible strain in the system , in the case of the nhs , due to that some of them do not contribute more than they take out of the nhs . 
  i have yet to find sources that study this issue , and by design it 's * very * hard to ever stay in the uk as an eu citizen ( or a citizen of any sort ) without either the means to support yourself with , or a viable employment ; benefits are not at all granted * just * by arriving in the uk , so through what mechanisms do these immigrants claim an employment in britain , and * not * contribute the due amount towards the nhs ? 
  i did not say `` fix your perception '' what i said was actually * very * close to what you are saying but on a more complex and more deepened way ( which , by the way , very nicely written ) . 
  what i said is that there is a perception that there are too many immigrants , okay ; why ? 
  we need to look at the issues that generate strains within the british systems of labor , healthcare , etc. . . that are being attributed to foreigners or the lower class and carefully address them . 
  you 've mentioned the nhs 's design in contrast with the usual european design ; i 'd argue that the nhs resembles more the french system than the dutch one does , but that would not really be the point . 
  you claimed that the uk is full of `` foreign low earners '' who wo n't contribute that much to it ; which , fair enough , might be true . 
  is the solution to this to have a government that has been cutting nhs spending ? 
  not to mention , and i 'm quoting a video made by the nhs itself against the tory government in the just before the recent election , that foreigners ( especially eu ones ) actually contribute to the nhs far more due to their work that the british merely do not ( ie nurses being a prime case ) , as well as debunking the theory that immigrants and health tourism actually are not the main cause for the nhs 's lack of performance ? 
  from my perspective i agree that the uk , due to its history and design is not really like the rest of europe to an extent , and it is not at all an overly nationalistic country with no room for pluralistic ideas & migration ; however what it seems to me is that immigrants have become a * very * easy target that though highly debunked , are the new scapegoat for the uk ( for now ) ; and instead of repairing the issues that immigration * does * cause as well as other issues that are said to be * because * of immigration , there was more of a push by the british government to just keep accusing this and that entity ; thus resulting in the british people being led to vote for brexit with claims that do n't really match britain . 
  we agree that the uk is not at all a foreign-hating country , and that its systems are different from the ones in europe ; however the issues raised have been very often not addressed other than the usual political scapegoating . 
  i hate to say it but even though things are looking bleak , i think we have worse . 
  maybe worst in * western * europe . 
  if that party is someone who entirely misused a very basic article and whose sole argumentation is my use of the english language whilst also making some questionable choices ; no i wo n't . 
  call it what you will . 
  from my perspective , the problem is a * perception * of too many foreigners . 
  this translates to basically seeing more and more individuals who do not follow the societal norms the british do . 
  this is an issue that needs to be addressed directly within the uk and not accusing this or that external entity for their issues . 
  you ** dangerously ** underestimate our dams and dikes . 
  so what * is * too many foreigners ? 
  i live in a community where most people are n't white ( black or southeast asian are the majority ) and they all are dutch . 
  would you say that the * actual * problem is lack of integration from certain immigration groups ? 
   the reality is that they did grant fewer visas to non-eu immigrants . 
  it 's a tough political position though because the asian vote in the uk is significant and also because even with strict rules you still have to allow family member etc. 
  what exactly are the fears over immigration ? 
  and to what extent are other eu citizens part of this problem ? 
  yeah , fuck the dutch for trying to provide electricity to a village !, 
  who do they think they are !, 
  the same permits that almost never are granted to non-israelis ? 
  sure , we 'll try , but this still does not justify taking away basic infrastructure materials from the needy . 
  if this truly was a huge problem , then absolute legal action should be taken against the dutch government ; yet instead of that , israel decided to deprive a village from access to electricity . 
  i mean ... really ? 
  ** we built electricity facilities for the needy ** sue us . 
  seriously , the israeli state has tonnes of laws and regulations that constantly degrade the quality of life of people in the west bank and in the gaza strip ; you literally even confiscated cows and now solar panels , now for what ? 
  not to mention ; you could have easily taken action legal action against the netherlands while also providing electricity to these people who are ** still in your country **, 
   honestly the requirements for non-eu citizens are horrific in the uk . 
  nobody is getting in unless they 're a high earner or have immediate family there . 
  the fact that the uk has a large number of immigrants from non-eu countries did n't help the eu in the referendum you realise ? 
  plenty of indians and pakistanis voted for brexit because they though it would mean the uk could relax the rules for non-eu immigrants ? 
  even as a native briton you need to earn a decent salary before you can even bring your husband or wife into the country . 
  so immigration is * not * an issue to the uk ? 
  because it 's still hard ? 
   you do realise that right now the official policy is that the uk is leaving the internal market ? 
  most of the support for staying in the eea is coming from the remain side , who were never anti-eu in the first place . 
  what they want is a trade deal of some sort that will minimise economic changes , but that does n't equate to eea membership . 
  yes , and i never said anything even remotely like that . 
  what i said is that it is nonsensical for the uk to remain within the internal market if it wants to curb freedom of movement , thus this is a wish from the british side and not the eu 's since it is not the eu who has designed the internal market nor controls the requirements it entails ( this competence is at the hands of the 28 member states via correctional treaties to the teu and tfeu ) . 
   you ca n't deny that there was some support for a shared refugee programme which spooked some british voters , even if nothing came of it . 
  there was , and now it died off . 
  it seemed very obvious to me it was not going to get accepted due to the sheer amount of controversy it would cause for nearly every member state , and lo and behold , it did n't go anywhere . 
   i think we both here understand that if the dutch really wanted these palestinians to have the solar panels they would have gone through the proper channels and got it approved like other humanitarian projects [ as i said before , usaid does n't seem to have this problem and they are very prominent in the wb ] , instead it was nothing more then a cheap provocation . 
  again , ** how is building electric facilities for an empoverished village a provocation ** ? 
   also , expecting us to be perfect is ridicules , and expecting the israeli government not to enforce the law because its a humanitarian project is even more ridicules considering that in our neighborhood not enforcing laws is displaying weakness and a invitation for further degradation of control , this is n't switzerland and life is tough here . 
  oh sure , so i guess that we should * keep * depriving these people of basic needs , right ? 
   edit : now imagine that israel would start donating solar panels to a group of gypsies that do n't follow the local zoning requirements and building regulations , do you think france or any other country would n't at the very least take these panels away ? 
  if it were the netherlands , chances are that there would be a progressive and adaptive procedure . 
  we do n't just leave off people without access to necessities . 
  meanwhile in israel instead of providing these people with basic needs or at least leaving it as is , you followed your own law ( sure , it 's correct ) but not to the extent that illegal jewish settlements in the area according to the same laws are concerned . 
  it comes off as a hipocritical mess and just causes suffering for them , needless suffering that does not have any justification . 
   having an option that can be used to prevent something is not the same a rule to prevent you from doing something . 
  does this option work ? 
  does it have the effect intended of preventing the entry of even larger quantities of refugees into the eu ? 
  yes . 
  thus by logic : ** this prevents that ** . 
   having an option that can be used to prevent something is not the same a rule to prevent you from doing something . 
  so you argue that because i used `` prevent '' in a context that can be taken in a different way that everything is invalid ? 
  sure . 
   since we 're arguing , you 're unlikely to listen to me , but please go to / r/englishlearning or something similar and ask about this . 
  because your understanding of the word ` prevent ' is n't right .
