  i wo n't really , because my english is not the subject at hand , and after 3 exams that prove i have an english level of c2 , as well as graduating an oib diploma in british language , culture , and history ; i have no advice to take from a random stranger in the internet who can not be bothered to read the articles he quotes . 
  what is it then ? 
  enlighten me . 
  the calais has been known for even on occasion killing people due to its structure , and being built with the sole purpose of servicing illegal migrants reach the uk . 
  it was not humanitarian . 
  roma structures also got destroyed , though i 'd argue that 's also quite a cunt move on our part ; guess what , we 're not perfect either !, 
  however to accuse us of whatever you want does not change the stance of what israel has done . 
  an apartheid-esque situation that deprives humans of basic access to necessities , prevents them even from becoming self sufficient or from receiving support from 3rd parties . 
  israel has * prevented electricity to be at reach of these people * , how is that something you 'd like to defend ? 
  providing electricity to a group of deprived people is provocation ? 
  til . 
  israel could have very easily let the electric supplies working to provide that village with power , and take legal action against the netherlands ; yet instead it confiscated the materials , depriving them * again * of a basic need . 
  if israel shits on humanitarian needs constantly ( even confiscating cows from these territories because they are `` a national threat '' ) then i have absolutely no problem going against israeli legal terms and helping those who genuinely need it . 
   huh ? 
  did you misread what i said , or do you believe the eu is happy to hold trade and brexit bill talks in parallel ? 
  no they are not , i just said so . 
  i believe you 're the one who keeps misreading much , especially the article * you * quoted yet do not understand . 
   having an option does n't prevent a country from taking refugees !, 
  it gives a second option that can and * is * used to prevent such a thing . 
  the definition of prevention is `` keep ( something ) from happening '' which is what this does . 
  it prevents refugees from having to be admitted into an eu member state . 
   i do n't mean to be offensive , but is english your native language ? 
  no , though i 'm pretty sure it 's irrelevant considering my level academically . 
   because the eu decided that it would refuse to have all and any trade talks until the uk agreed to pay up . 
  not really , considering the uk has n't given a proper response to it for * months * and then * agreed * to negotiations over it . 
  saying `` i wo n't pay anything ! '', 
  would result in no negotiations , which never happened , the uk never refused , it just took a damn long time to get a negotiation stance ready . 
   er , that 's the aim !, 
  that 's not a rule to prevent countries from taking in refugees !!, 
  rule : for every refused asylum seeker application , you can pay 250 000 $ to have this person transported to another country and kept there instead . 
  this prevents countries from taking unwanted refugees since they have the option to send them away to another safe country . 
   so why do you believe that these are rules to prevent countries from taking in refugees ? 
  because , according to your article , there is a new rule that helps lessen the burden in the eu . 
  the new deal includes a set of agreements , rules to be followed by both sides . 
   true - it takes two years . 
  that 's regardless of ` maymay ' . 
  ( is that your pet name for her ? ), 
  it takes an initial max of two years but can be extended * if * all member states ( and the leaving party ) are in agreement to that at the end of incomplete negotiations . 
  they can very easily be done early , though thus far there 's been nearly no evolution , thus promoting a painfully slow process . 
   have you got a source on that ? 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  prevent countries from taking in refugees ?? 
  yes , your own article :  new proposed asylum rules aim to ease burden of countries on front line of europe 's migrant crisis  a good deal for preventing countries from taking in refugees ? 
  what ?? 
  countries do n't want to take in refugees , now have the option to pay a smaller fee than what keeping up refugees actually costs for * another * country , outside the eu , to keep them . 
   refugees that we 're preventing countries from taking in ? 
  you pay less per person , you also get less of these people among your population . 
  * have you read your own article ? 
   obviously we did n't and hence brexit , duh !, 
  then ** you ** voted out of the eu , the eu did n't force you to leave . 
   and so we left . 
  not yet because negotiations are chaotic in the uk 's side , thanks maymay . 
   `` new asylum rules forcing member countries to take in refugees ... require nations to pay $ 250,000 ( $ 287,000 ) for each asylum seeker they refuse . '', 
  ya , it was a deal to ** prevent ** these countries from taking in refugees and instead keeping them somewhere else . 
  not only that , 250 000 $ will not cover that much the cost of living for the conflict , so it is a pretty damn good deal . 
  you get * less * refugees and you * pay * less too . 
  not for everything , not for unemployment for example . 
   yes . 
  the uk just wanted to decrease immigration . 
  the eu told them that if they wanted that then they had to leave . 
  if they did they would start by granting less visas to non-eu population . 
  if they wanted to decrease eu population then ** why the fuck would they stay in the internal market which includes freedom of movement ** ? 
   because they wanted to decrease eu immigration . 
  and the eu told them that they 'd have to leave if they want that . 
  because it 's true , you can not be part of an internal market and artifically start asking for visas . 
   are you telling me that the wsj is lying ? 
  https://www.wsj.com/articles/european-commission-backs-visa-free-travel-for-turks-1462357287 turks still can not reside nor work in the eu without the usual visas , this changes very little to nothing considering that this means that turks can * visit * and leave more easily . 
  that literally is it . 
   and the guardian ? 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/08/austria-calls-for-less-funding-for-eu-countries-refusing-refugees til austria = the entire eu . 
  austria made a call , sure , and did it go anywhere ? 
  nope . 
  pot , meet kettle . 
  ** fuck you finland you coffee drinking swedish russians , suck iiiiiit ** / s, 
   the eu is too busy forcing the uk * forcing * the uk out ? 
   because it dared to want a decrease in immigration * they themselves voted to get out , what ? 
  *  and too busy trying to beat the eastern eu countries into taking more muslim immigrants against their will . 
  you mean the highly debunked resettlement programme that went nowhere ? 
  ** no need for a navy if we polder the planet , ** *** beware motherfuckers ***, 
  with people in them , we 'd be ensuring we would be killing them . 
  that 's part of the problem . 
  there are already measures to destroy the ships that come through with illegal immigrants , though it 's somewhat complicated as well . 
  * sorry * for trying to grant electricity to a village under the jurisdiction of a country that nearly never ever grants any permits to non-israelis and actively undermines access to basic necessities to another group of people . 
  ** [ communism ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stlzekojg10 ) **, 
  okay this is something i 'm not gon na get into because it 's a shitfest of a debate . 
  basically the west bank and the gaza strip are * somewhat * under israeli jurisdiction , but they are heavily segregated , and even have groups within them trying to take israel out of the picture . 
  it 's a ** very ** complicated situation , mainly due to the whole palestine/israel dispute , what 's what and who 's who . 
  i mean , ours is n't in the capital either ... 
   orange boyz kek . 
  that 's the core of it , basically.the netherlands gave solar panels so the west bank could have better electricity , israel steps in and under the pretext they did n't have the horridly complicated building permits , just confiscated the fuck out of it . 
  it 's just really a dick move to a humanitarian project . 
  well with global warming and all ... 
  no , it is a west with new relationships with the east . 
  the former communist east is now * much * more open to us and in direct contact ; which has generated far more complex relationships between east and west . 
  today 's west also contrasts itself in new ways from the east , mainly economic factors that still divide the two , the degree of integration of member states , the different stances and cooperative measures taken among them etc. . . 
  there is no longer a huge binary vision between capitalism/communism ; instead we have a whole bunch of capitalist economies , which still have an east/west divide yet are hyperconnected via the eu and have a new , more complex relationship . 
  germany , for example , has far better ties now with poland and czechia than in the cold war ; trade with the former communist bloc is ** huge ** compared to what it was back then , and since relationships between the two have now grown , the west has now become a different force ; not a force of opposition against a communist `` other '' but nowadays a cooperative partner ( for best and worst ) of the poorer regions of europe , still in contrast over social ideals and political stances . 
  would you argue that finland , which is part of the west , is the same exact with estonia ? 
  or the netherlands and poland ? 
  etc. . .
