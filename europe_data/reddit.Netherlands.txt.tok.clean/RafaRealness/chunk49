  the west has a very different role and a very different attitude , and the demarcation between the east and the west from the cold war no longer fits at all . 
  germany being a prime example , austria being a close second too . 
  i 'm not trying to convince you that there 's no west ... what i said is that the `` west '' is not the same nowadays as it was back then . 
  have you even read my comments ? 
  here 's a quote :  we have a new west nowadays , with a different definition and a different attitude . 
  lem me join in . 
  but can we seriously say that 1990 's germany , and even 1990 's europe is the same as today ? 
  we have eastern europe in the eu , we still have a way to go , but both the east and the west have changed so much , i 'd argue that there are new demarcation lines nowadays . 
  the cold war divide is outdated , we have a new one with different stances and relationships . 
  what about the millions of people who were born and raised in the ddr ? 
  a `` cold war west '' merely does n't exist anymore , i mean , are we going to seriously just going to ignore that germany was * very * divided back then ? 
  and that times have supremely changed as well ? 
  we have a new west nowadays , with a different definition and a different attitude . 
  ... so what side is a country that was split during the cold war , whose leader was born in the west but afterwards moved to the east ? 
  ** w o k e. **, 
  * and the iberian peninsula and most of the benelux ( maybe metropolitan areas of germany as well ), 
  medication for what ? 
  so you only like him because he 's hated by really dumb susceptible people ? 
  i mean , sure you can do that ; but i still think it 's odd . 
  for me you 're still being guided as much as a sheep as they are because you are not forming your own opinion on him , you 're basing your opinion on the opinions of idiots ... 
  i mean ... 
  i 'd say hitler is pretty much universally hated too . 
  i 'm not saying he 's good nor bad ( i care more about my neighbor 's cat than him ) but just liking him because he 's hated strikes me as a very odd thing . 
   neither hungarian nor american but jewish til that if you are a jew you can not be anything else . 
  i looked it up , and yeah it looks great , though i still thing that the ddr 's geometric soviet prefab style was better ; though now it 's hugely outdated , so it 's perhaps for the best to have this one instead . 
  ... can someone explain to me what the heck i 'm looking at right now ? 
  yeah , those , plus i also liked the general `` identity '' elements that the government built for itself , and the propaganda posters , and the architecture choices ( * before * they degraded ) there was a whole design philosophy behind it that i find really interesting . 
  it all somewhat came together as this tightly knit ideal of the german version of the communist system ; pretty interesting . 
  ** shut it down **, 
  yeah i 'd guess it would n't be accurate , thanks for correcting . 
  i was taught that two died as salazar 's guards shot into a crowd outside his office , and another two died smushed by either the crowd or a tank after the revolution . 
  that 's at least what my history teacher told us and i have some doubts over it to be honest . 
  i agree , i 'd even consider them criminals seen as they are * very * obviously trying to stop the democratic process of kosovo . 
  i think that this parliament has my favorite design , and i really liked der palast der republik . 
  overall the ddr did one thing right : it * looked * great . 
  though it is for the best that it 's now over . 
  no , they 're actually just continuing procedure . 
  they did this twice , once it interrupted the session , the second time , not so much . 
  this was a protest by the opposition on a deal that granted the serb minority in kosovo more powers . 
  context for this song : this song is called `` vila morena '' and was played in the radio as a sign for the 25th of april revolution , so they are singing a song heavily linked to the end of the estado novo . 
  gay, 
  well , not always , but there * is * the functionalist approach to integration , which * is * definitely a thing , and i 'd argue more needed now as well to deal with modern eu-wide issues . 
   join jugoslavija you * wanted * to join ? 
  i thought you were just thrown in and bam . 
  makes sense then , seems more comfortable , and less claustrophobic . 
   bulgaria is more socially progressive country than netherlands where they would paint their faces in black and think that 's normal . 
  and here we see someone entirely ignorant of dutch culture and the state of affairs concerning zwarte piet . 
   did you also realize that until yesterday , gay marriage was illegal in germany ? 
  it does n't count because its germany . 
  it 's not okay , and i bitched about it quite a lot . 
  at least , however , in germany , i do n't need to worry about lgbt attacks which , lo and behold , is a [ known and studied issue ] ( https://rainbow-europe.org/country-ranking ) in eastern europe . 
   your delusional view of eastern europe pisses me off so much i would punch you in your mouth . 
  `` civil ''  literally 10 years ago gay people would get arrested in england . 
  in 2007 gay people would get arrested in england ? 
  sure ...  netherlands is so much worse in so many ways . 
  fine , do n't come here then . 
  at least we do n't get so pissy and want to punch people in the mouth . 
  and as for your vision of bulgaria 's `` socially progressiveness '' being even * near * the level of the netherlands : [ here , have a perfume made by a drag queen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d84opkf.gif ), 
  whip it out ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i have yet to ever meet one . 
  i mean , sure , some lgbt people genuinely are idiotic cunts ( fuck lucian piane for example ) but over gay marriage ? 
  all i 've ever met is people always saying the same thing : `` i believe that same-sex couples deserve the * same rights * as heterosexual couples '' how can that be taken to any extreme ? 
  most things are better than 4chan . 
  i agree with the question of elections , however i believe that the diaspora should still have a say on national elections , especially to counteract possible disinformation happening in that country , as well as maintain strong ties with other countries and promote warm ties . 
  i believe that this debate * does * reveal a problem with the current arrangement , and as you say there are voters who will be a detriment ; however considering the examples i 've seen of diaspora voting ( which usually agrees heavily with the results , especially in western european elections ) this seems to be a ** very ** small issue ; though i also believe that this problem * does * exist , for example in the netherlands you must be a dutch citizen to vote and lo and behold some poor sods voted for ** denk ** ( ugh ) . 
   why do you think that people who want to become citizens of another nation should n't have to make any real sacrifice to do so ? 
  because some people ** ca n't ** as i explained . 
  do you have around 100 000 $ lying around ? 
  then you can help people trying to become dutch citizens by paying their fare out of their citizenship . 
  furthermore you are asking for sacrifices that not all nationals have to do . 
  for example if i am algerian i can retain easily rights over family access ( guess what ? 
  immigrants have often their family abroad ) which i believe is quite inhumane to be asked to sacrifice . 
   why are you so desperately trying to be a doormat ? 
  no clue what you mean by this . 
  very much doubt it . 
  i mean , if * you * do illegal downloads then it still is all on you , no matter what connection . 
  furthermore , i believe that you need to be a registered network operator in order to be held non-liable for * someone else * using your network for illegal downloads . 
  although i agree with your stance , please understand that for immigrants living abroad , giving up your citizenship can result in other problems further down the road , such as visa requirements to see your family or problems with heritage in case someone dies . 
  also , the dutch naturalization process towards citizenship requires you to refuse any other citizenship , but there are exceptions because for some countries ( ethiopia for example ) this can cost amounts of money you really can not afford ( mainly due to links with military service as well ) . 
  although a good idea in principle , it has very complicated consequences for immigrants who , even if they are 100 % integrated , still do not wish to have to face a loss of rights nor be required to afford hefty fees to buy themselves out of a citizenship . 
  i have not the slightest idea what you 're saying . 
  but it sounds * so pretty * . 
  it 's a city that before was riddled with franco-german wars all the time . 
  afterwards it was constructed to be held as a symbol of unity and prosperity within the eu as france and germany made peace . 
  it 's also where the european parliament is officially , which is where the big hemicycle they held the ceremony in can be found . 
  yeah , i 'd say so . 
  i think that these methods should be more open ( to the extent they are safely regulated , of course ) in all of europe and also hopefully we 'd see these more popularized in non-gay couples , to promote a way to safely have healthy children . 
  i still think that adoption is bigger though , which is nice as well since i believe that biological link should not matter as much , and a world with more adopted children is slightly less bleak indeed . 
  where they sure knew how to take care of a ** living room ** heheheh ^ ( please someone get this ), 
  are you sure ? 
  i 'd rather give that award to the gdr , which definitely had an identity boner with its design , plus also great stuff arts-wise ( also no i 'm not defending the gdr i 'm just saying they had stuff i find pretty ), 
  it 's quite a sad day indeed , she is truly a french hero , and i hope her name goes down in history books for all the good she 's done for us . 
  something equally sad is the inevitable 4chan-esque comments about her being jewish and such . 
   i hope than one day i 'll be able to do the same . 
  maybe when the world will be ruled by lesbians and they 'll decide to send all straight males to reeducation camps , i 'll be there to defend your rights !, 
  oh tell me why exactly i deserve less rights for being in a gay relationship, 
   they already do n't have children we do actually !, 
  with today 's tech gay couples ( be it men or women ) can actually conceive children via surrogate mothers and artificial insemination ( for men ) or just artificial insemination ( for women ) . 
  in spain there 's a pretty nice economy of doing this , not exclusive at all to gay people either , single people who wish to safely bring a child into the world do it too . 
  there 's a * constitutional * ban on gay marriage .
