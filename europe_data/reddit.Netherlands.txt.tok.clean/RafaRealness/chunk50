  you grant less rights to homosexual couples still . 
  i would n't really call that much `` progress '' , especially with orban wanting to even revert * that * . 
   if civil union gives same rights as marriage than its the best outcome . 
  but it does n't ... that 's * literally * the problem . 
   keep marriage as concept between sane union of a man and woman . 
  be it in church or just through state . 
  why ? 
  who are you to say what 's `` sane '' ? 
  is homosexuality therefore insane ? 
  even though homosexuality is something observable in thousands of species , yet homophobia is only found in one ? 
   in the end everyone sane will be happy because the only difference will be just a meaningless label and nothing more . 
  but we get * less * rights with a civil partnership than we do with an actual gay marriage . 
  i agree that the term `` marriage '' is just a label , but i 'm not going to pretend that civil partnerships in estonia have the same rights as actual marriage because they very clearly do not . 
  this seems like its own room , does the part of the right of this picture look into the parliament 's picture like above ? 
  ** your mere disguises can not hide your commie-ness from the great bald eagle 's eyes **, 
  what did it recognize it as ? 
  edit : oh , hindi . 
  yep , very easy to mistake croatian for hindi , they are super close !, 
  ** blessed be the digital god **, 
  house of cards in croatian ( i 'm fully trusting google translate on this one , sue me ), 
  kula od karata ? 
  yes , perhaps so . 
  in either case it was very interesting to see the place through their seats , it looks quite a bit smaller in real life . 
  no , sorry , i mean another , smaller room within the parliament that really is just a smaller version of this hemicycle . 
  we used it to interview an mep from d66 . 
  the room was near identical to the one on this thread , but smaller , and it only had like 14 language booths ; though it was equipped with the same microphone and voting prompts as these ones . 
  do n't blame americans , they get a cold war ptsd attack every time they see red in flags / s, 
   breaking it up by demographics , the only group that is supportive is young estonian-speakers , the older the estonian-speaker is , the less likely are they to support gay rights . 
  russian-speakers are almost universally against ( they have generally very similar values to russians in russia ) . 
  i understand that estonia has a big russian minority , and as i 've heard , the younger generations of this minority are integrating far better into estonian community , especially in terms of language . 
  do they count as russian or as estonian speakers in this case ? 
  im an idiot im sorry oh god i misread . 
  i agree to what you say however i see a problem : you need to have people financially better off * to motivate them * to have kids , which means that they do not have children quite yet . 
  this mechanism allows to aim towards the demographic that is most likely to procreate . 
  i * do * however agree that there should be some arrangements for single parents to have a better and easier situation for their children ( though this already is arguably the case through numerous state helps ) . 
  where did this tradition of discussing such affairs under a symbolic oak tree come from ? 
  what did this mean ? 
  what is the public opinion revolving gay rights in estonia ? 
  i love how geometric it all is , looks great . 
  what is that symbol above the speaker ? 
  it looks pretty cool . 
  important for estonia and malta : gay marriage is not legal in these countries * however * they recognize gay marriage . 
  this in practice means that two estonian men can get married in finland , and it will be recognized in estonia as an actual marriage . 
  same goes for two maltese gay people getting married in france . 
  glad to have ya onboard !, 
  we do ? 
  that 's quite new to me . 
  must be all that pesky fascism we have all over the place !, 
  please do n't cut any oranges against us , oh please . 
   we mostly care about ethnicity . 
  so did we , a while ago . 
  why do n't you practice what you preach ? 
  you deny me from having rights that you already have ; including but not limited to ever form a family recognized and protected by law , having a say for my husband if he ever falls ill or even dies , etc. . . do n't dare to say you love and support me . 
  you actively want to put an end to my rights and even want to prevent me from building a family . 
  there are many christians that * do * actually love and support the lgbt community , and those are the ones who defend our rights , and who leave us to our own lives peacefully . 
  i 'm gay , take a wild guess . 
  no , because in my country , gay people can adopt children as well as procreate through other scientific methods . 
  humanity has the technology and skill to grant children to gay couples and does so quite often as well . 
  you also ignored what i said about the other benefits of marriage , which do not at all have a link to procreation ; such as important rights in case of justice as well as health and death . 
  this should not at all be exclusive to heterosexual couples . 
   that ... seems wrong * the netherlands and belgium would like to have a word with you *, 
  ** fuck ** we broke germany ... 
  i can always appreciate a more minimalist approach to rooms . 
  i love this one , though i wish that the speaker 's booth 's design was different so the stairs were more discrete , or in junction to the right on what seems to be the wheel chair access . 
  no no , * mayo * that bitch up . 
  lithuania in disguise . 
  potato peeling compilations . 
  now i 'm thinking about all the sex jokes you can make in parliament ... oh lawd . 
  i was in there a few weeks ago , there is another one that looks a bit smaller than this , and has slightly different desk configuration . 
  makes sense , though it still feels like if you let the media in there ( to film it and such ) it would be cramped in there . 
  ... this is my new favorite bot . 
  is it just me or does this look like a very small room to be a parliament ? 
   whose consent are we talking about ? 
  what should happen to those who do n't consent and therefore do n't pay the extra taxes of being single ? 
  why should single persons pay extra in taxes to support the children of others ... supposing they do n't consent ? 
  in this instance , i am talking about the consent of the german citizens . 
  i believe that a government has the power to enforce its laws as the general population consents to obey them which * is * the case of germany . 
  german citizens agree to uphold laws , and the government must rule on their best interest . 
  this includes also * as i said 2 times previously * decisions and systems that generate partial discriminations , but in the greater scheme of things are generally acceptable and do not severely hinder human rights . 
   do you think governments should control demographic change by controlling immigration as well ? 
  to what lengths may a government go to control demographics ? 
  taxation of the single you agree with . 
  what about china 's one child policy ? 
  what about sterilization of the mentally or physically handicapped ... what about simply the mentally or physically `` unfit '' ... who decides this unfitness . 
  ... let 's go all the way ... what about genocide of unfit races ? 
  i believe that the government should have control over immigration , yes . 
  i believe that , * for the 4th time * the government must rule by consent and if there were a democratic process in china ( which everyone knows there is not ) then this would be more evident . 
  we are talking about a system that does not infringe human rights , that is generally acceptable by the population , and as a bonus also by the international community ; comparing it to measures you took straight out of nazi germany is a gross misconception and entirely ignores legally bound human rights in europe that prevent any and all of these despicable measures from taking place . 
  i agreed that we should have a tax reduction system to promote couples having children . 
  i did not agree that we should even * begin * consider `` unfitness '' of people or forced sterilization . 
  one is a tax deduction , the other one is human rights violation . 
   let 's ask it another way : why should single people pay more in taxes ? 
  why is it the government 's business to promote reproduction ... to make more in taxes ? 
  i believe it is the government 's business to rule by consent . 
  thus far i have never ever heard about anyone against the government actively promoting a healthy development of the demographics of their native population . 
  i believe that this system seems correct and under consent of the population a government must answer to , it should be maintained . 
   why should the government need to get involved with the later ... it seems like a simple statement before a public notary would be sufficient ? 
  it is not , because that is very prone to mistakes , abuses , and more . 
  furthermore , i believe that , again , the government * should * promote healthy demographic developments by the powers granted to it by its people . 
  is this system criticable ?
