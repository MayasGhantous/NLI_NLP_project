  yes , as you say it generates inequalities between married and unmarried individuals ; however i believe that it is better to have * this * inequality than to abolish the system and have less tools at our disposal to answer demographic change . 
  promote couples to have kids . 
  it is something that germany ( and a lot of other places in europe ) need right now : to deal with an aging population . 
  couples who have a better financial situation are more inclined to have children . 
  furthermore , getting hitched also grants you rights for closer cooperation with your partner ; some of them are very useful in case they fall ill or even die , which i consider ( if i ever get in a long-term relationship ) something important . 
  that second picture though . 
  that 's the type of love i hope for when i get married . 
  with all the havoc of brexit , trump , etc. . . at least we can appreciate the quality memes and banter we 're getting from it . 
  you are ** celebrating the death of a human being ** . 
  you are not much better in my eyes . 
  he also used a great tragedy , a shootout of a gay club , to advance his political agenda grossly ; showing utterly no respect nor for the community , nor for the victims . 
  not to mention , he said he wants to make gay marriage a state affair and not a federal one , resulting in the very likely end of gay marriage in some states . 
  also , who the fuck said that merkel is the `` leader of the free world '' ? 
  the cold war is over and she 's just the leader of germany ... 
  i would probably get in quite a bit of trouble , my university is * surrounded * by bloody coffeeshops , and if you get near them you can definitely smell it all ( though it 's very easily avoidable ) . 
  i 'd probably start getting high before and after lectures , oh lawd . 
   do you believe that you would get a second hand high just by standing near people ? 
  * oh how i can dream i could ... *, 
  [ here , you can have mine ] ( https://cdn3.volusion.com/nhepf.lvwfa/v/vspfiles/photos/1294-2.jpg ), 
  is that your basement slave 's safe-word ? 
  i think that a * lot * ( myself included ) merely do n't get it ? 
  it 's just the male and female signs , seems very unrelated . 
  c'mon , everybody knows that they 're british when it 's a good thing , and scottish when it 's a bad thing !, 
  ... by funding traditional and cultural associations all around the eu , even funding revivals of at-risk regional languages ? 
  or by promoting cross-cultural programmes and develop stronger stances on knowledge and celebration of europe 's rich traditions and cultures ? 
  the motto is * in varietate concordia * too , and they seem to pretty much hold that part of the bargain . 
   they brought a new meaning to `` being ahead of their time '' . 
  `` hipster '' / s, 
  once i was mad at my french friend for waking me up with her goddamn party next door . 
  so i synced her bluetooth speaker to my pc , put it at full volume , hid it in her room , and ** blasted ** the fuck out of this at night . 
  as if any of us would mind paying tribute to the divine potato, 
  sorry , not interested , i only date men . 
  i 'd actually love it for a drunk junker to just take the mic and start singing : ** c'est la luuuuuteeee finaaaaaleeee **, 
  full caps agenda pushing wooooooo !, 
  i agree , as i said , the problem is * both * factors . 
  i believe in the portuguese system , as it showed to have results better than what most expected . 
  i am not , however , going to pretend it 's a full end-all-be-all solution . 
  drugs , no matter how legal or illegal , * will * destroy you if you take them . 
  there are still victims of overdoses , of severe and painful health troubles , of social degradation , all because of hard drugs ; even * if * they seek help the damage is there . 
  i agree , and i think that the australian system is definitely something that we should look into and learn from them to understand how to deter maritime human trafficking and illegal migration . 
  i also believe that for the schengen space we need a common protection of external borders . 
  the current arrangement makes countries with external borders ( like italy or the baltics ) entirely responsible for their protection ; however i believe that * all * member states should cooperate and contribute to maintaining these borders safe and well guarded . 
  i made absolutely no statement nor of supporting nor of being against catalan independence . 
  i believe that catalans , just like kurds , just like scotsmen , etc. . . deserve a peaceful democratic process to choose to leave their country . 
  that 's it . 
  i do n't care if catalonia chooses one side or the other . 
   it 's not the drugs that are damaging , it 's the law . 
  it 's both . 
  even if you are not caught , the damages that drugs can take on your health can be irremediable , not to mention that your social life nearly always takes a heavy hit too . 
  do n't take drugs lightly , they can be devastating . 
  oh , it was n't in the netherlands !, 
  i lived in this small town near lisbon when i was young , and my dad once took me to a municipal election , but due to a fire they lost the regular place where the ballots were ; so instead they held it in this garden right in front of where i had sunday school ( religious stuff , but not the brain washy kind ) where they improvised with trashcans with holes in them . 
  it is , however , * super * simple and convenient in case you really need ballot boxes , so my guess is that maybe it happened in other countries too ( they are big plastic boxes with wheels , they are perfect ) . 
  i hope a peaceful and democratic process takes place for catalonia , it seems really like spain hates the idea of any independence from itself ; which strikes me as weird , the huge extent they appear to be going for . 
  what do you think the spanish government 's reaction will be if the referendum passes with a `` yes '' majority ? 
  it does not matter how many people are onboard as they will * not * port in italy . 
  they shall be sent on their way elsewhere , very likely their port of origin . 
  any and all unauthorized and illegal porting or even * attempt * of boarding must be stopped by authorities as a means of upholding italian law as well as stopping human trafficking and illegal migration towards europe . 
   it is an issue in that it shows that the catalan government is going rogue to the point where not even cardboard suppliers want to work with them . 
  and they expect to become an eu member because ... reasons . 
  where have you heard this information though ? 
  i have never by the life of me have heard of any arguments like these . 
  furthermore , there has already been a lot of debate and explanations and debunks over the formation of new independent states within the eu ( especially in 2014 with scotland ) . 
   because i am sick and tired of a bunch of arrogant assholes constantly claiming that they are better than me and that they are the only ones with a right to decide what happens to my country just because they were born a few km away and they believe that that gives them special rights . 
  so you do n't want them to vote at all ? 
  i 'm sorry that they are assholes , but spain is very much a democracy ; much like the netherlands . 
  if friesland ever wants to become independent via a binding referendum , why would i ever stop that ? 
  i do n't like it , but it is not * my * decision , it is the decision of the people who actually * live * in friesland . 
  the same goes , in my opinion , for catalonia ; its residents should have a say if they want to remain a part of spain or be independent . 
  the inhabitants of spain should always have the power to vote to leave the eu , right ? 
  without requiring other member states to allow it . 
  by the same logic , i believe that catalonia should have the right to a democratic process to decide for itself whether to remain a part of spain or not . 
  again , those are very easy to find and even produce with any box you have , i remember that once in a voting in my hometown we voted using a trash bin with a hole on it because there was a fire just before the municipal elections ... 
  so i 'm fairly sure this is n't an issue in the least . 
  from what i can tell you have a * huge * dislike for any debate on catalan independence , and i do n't want to start shit ; but you clearly seem * extremely * biased in this and do n't really give coherent arguments . 
  i do n't care if catalonia wants to be independent or not , as long as whatever the voters choose is respected . 
  why is this such a huge thing to begin with ? 
  and why is it that you sound as militant as those claiming that independence is inevitable ? 
  just chill , wait until the terms of this new * binding * referendum are announced , and then * with coherent arguments * talk about it ; be it if you 're for or against it . 
  ... i am fairly certain that the catalonian authorities can * very * easily get through with the referendum , even with such a wild claim as that . 
  plus , what do you want urns for in a referendum ? 
  i 'm not really sure what something to hold cremated people would be used for ... 
  i 'm happy that catalonia has an opportunity to have a say on the matter , but i 'm worried about the legal implications this has . 
   i do n't think we care that much about the government of spain at this point . 
  they will oppose to any democratic solution . 
  but they do n't realize they are actually making more catalans go for independence . 
  new york times already explained it pretty much . 
  yes , i 'd imagine so . 
   it 's a binding referendum on independence . 
  but what concretely is the legal binding ? 
  what is catalonia to be ? 
   catalonia will become the new state in europe  what kind ? 
  what will the catalan government look like ? 
  and will it need to rejoin the eu ? 
  if so , how will it do so when spain can veto the everlasting shite out of it ? 
  but this is still opposed by the government of spain . 
  what does this mean ? 
  will it be * just * a non-binding referendum to be ignored ? 
  i imagine if `` no '' wins it 's the end of it all , but what if `` yes '' wins ? 
  ... how ?
