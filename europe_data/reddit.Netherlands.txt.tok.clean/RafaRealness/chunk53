  not to mention the mess regarding mccain ? 
   the problem as i see it : is that politicians are/have put the safety of their citizens at risk for ideological reasons . 
  blair here in the uk with iraq/afghanistan , merkel with the migrants , sweden with their immigration policy , etc. 
  and i disagree , that is not at all the case that i see in the netherlands nor france nor portugal etc. . . germany and the uk have made some piss poor decisions , that 's for sure ; but i do not believe that this is all for ideology and empty rhetoric . 
  i also believe that you , if anything , are guilty of the same concerning your wish for direct democracy everywhere . 
  if you have an uneducated population that is easily manipulated and fooled , you will end up with tyrany in about 5 minutes because as soon as there is * one * small issue that an idiot blames on the status quo and starts going full geert wilders/le pen/farage , you 'll get no solutions and just havoc and devastation . 
  we are democracies , we are to be held accountable for the politicians we erect to power . 
  if you believe that your leaders are jeopardizing your safety , contest it , vote for the ones who * are * looking out for you ; or if there is nobody there , * become * it . 
  i am happy to be in the netherlands , i feel safe and i can trust my government and its leaders ; plus i can trust that nutjobs like geert are kept at bay and that we do n't fall into the hands of extremisms again . 
   because we 've done it before . 
  we already know it 's possible and some of the nuances on how to do it . 
  do you not remember the conditions of our continent ? 
  or how much it took to get the uk onboard with it ? 
  or even how many crisis were faced during its first years ? 
   i simply do n't believe that \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af no malice here , in fact i hope i 'm wrong . 
  your problem , i got to interview an mep from d66 a few weeks ago , in brussels , as part of a study trip . 
  we were shown several measures and projects that are currently happening in the eu to answer the democratic deficit . 
  believe it or not . 
   which the politicians have proven they do n't know/understand/respect : see migrant crisis , war , attacks on freedom/privacy , etc. 
  the government should be afraid of the people , and be jumping to address the needs/wants of the people . 
  i very much trust the dutch government , and i believe it has made a good job regarding the points you have mentioned . 
  are you sure the problem is in brussels , or in london , in this case ? 
  i think you 're partially right , and that part of the problem is what you say . 
  i think brexit definitely is going to be far worse for the uk , but there is no point ( in fact , it seems counterproductive ) to deny that it 'll suck for the rest of the eu as well . 
  ** all hail the potato master ** i can hear the irish and the baltics furiously masturbating , obby . 
   i do n't believe it can be fixed : it requires the eu to vote to give its power back to the people , and for pretty drastic treaty changes ( which requires unanimous eu28 agreement ) . 
  so i believe it 's better to burn it down and start again . 
  do you remember what it took us just to start even * considering * a union of this type to begin with ? 
  how do you want to destroy all the progress made thus far , close all bridges , burn everything that was built , and recommence a ** huge ** and painfully long process of integration ? 
  it * can * be fixed and it has begun being fixed ; slowly as everything ( as the eu often is ) but surely . 
   and that is a failure of the government to be connected to the people they 're supposed to represent , not the people . 
  no , it merely is that we can not risk to entirely have a swiss system when we ourselves are not adapted towards it . 
  i remember that when democracy started in my country , it was chaos and havoc because the people merely were not taking it seriously at all , and often took it so lightly that it was nothing . 
  we can not let this happen , the people must have a government fit for them that they accept as their own and consent to being governed by . 
  we thus need progressive yet decisive solutions towards a better democracy that fits the needs and wants of the peoples of europe , and not ideals of the past that have proven to be even * dangerous * at times . 
  we should ** all ** take a similar stance to stop this chaos . 
  i seriously doubt that these boats , if blocked by portugal , spain , france , italy , slovenia , croatia , greece , and cyprus , will even * attempt * of reaching the eu via maritime borders . 
  this will close one of the ways into the eu illegally , next , we should focus on land borders such as the one between turkey and greece , or spain 's cities in africa . 
  so , instead of * fixing * the eu and supporting pushes and pressures for reforms in order to expand direct democratic say towards the eu , you left ? 
  i agree that there are definitely imbalances , but leaving is the contrary of the solution . 
  as i see it , our national governments do not wish for further necessary integration nor do they want to listen to pushes for an eu closer to its citizens ( after all , they are the ones with the ultimate power for reforming the system ) , furthermore the eu itself already has both external and internal pressures for multiple reforms , that now slowly are starting to take afoot and transpose themselves into slow progression towards a more democratic system . 
  i do n't , however , believe that we should have as much direct democracy as possible , there * are * limits that should be imposed not only for the sake of efficiency , but also for the fact that we are not all switzerland and our population is not as connected to such political tradition nor higher education . 
  so instead of blaming the eu for tonnes of evil and despair , instead of leaving the union in claims of regaining muh soverenth\u00e9h , fixit , do n't brexit . 
   it 's just called ireland , confusingly enough . 
  i made the distinction specifically to not mistaken northern ireland from the republic of ireland ...  yeah , but that was back when we abused them a bit . 
  nowadays i 'm not sure people would actually care ? 
  ( if they actually thought about it logically ) . 
  this still does not answer any of my questions . 
  from what i can tell , irish people are very happy living in their own country ran by themselves , and not being a part of the uk . 
   exactly !, 
  winners all ` round !, 
  why would the uk not want to just form a federal eu then ? 
  ireland reunited , all under one government , etc etc etc. . . 
  is this a sitcom reference i 'm missing ? 
  i honestly only know that letterkenny is a place in ireland and also a sitcom ( i think ), 
  i nearly feel bad for having to say it , * nearly * ** swoosh **, 
   brexit means we can repeal eu alcohol regulations  this does not answer my question . 
  if i remember correctly , ireland * really * did not want to be a part of the uk , hence why there 's now a republic of ireland . 
   well they seem pretty displeased with the whole irish tax situation , so it 'd be one less worry for them . 
  by that logic , brexit is great for the eu since we are finally getting rid of a member who broke , on multiple accounts , regulations regarding external trade and internal citizens ' rights . 
  but wo n't ireland be sad it 's under the uk again ? 
  and wo n't the eu be pissed it lost * two * member states ? 
  [ ( necessary sound effect ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqo-v-zez24 ), 
  same can be said about * tonnes * of things if your argument is `` it 's been like this for a long time '' though . 
  i 'm pretty sure that there was two germanies just a while ago , and that czechoslovakia , yugoslavia , and the ussr all were very much things too . 
  also did n't the uk used to have a fuck tonne of parts that are now independent ? 
  like france did too ? 
  times change and we change with them . 
  this for me seems like a step forward ; the czechs should be able to possess and carry firearms * if * they pass the already required mental , physical , practice , and safety exams , plus background checks . 
  in fact , i believe that any country should allow such a practice under the strict conditions of being fully sure that the people who are allowed to have firearms are clear of any possible trouble . 
  agreed , the eu has problems , and the end of the uk 's contributions to the budget is one ; though it still boggles my mind why we need articles stating the painfully obvious . 
   communists want to build a society where everyone is equal , everyone gets their food freely and works to their possibilities . 
  there is already an example of such a society in almost every city - a prison facility . 
  i am stealing the everliving crap out of this quote though , it 's pretty damn good . 
  ** g a y s p a c e **, 
  okay i love the eu but let me just say ** no fucking shit ** a net contributor to the eu is leaving , what the heck did anyone with the basic knowledge of maths expect ? 
  except the orangest of them all . 
   gas them if they get to uppity . 
  sounds familiar . 
  ... okay but that 's a damn good deal , where !, 
  ** c ' e s t _ n o t r e _ p r o j e t **, 
  one year, 
  no * you 're * ours . 
  as i read it , i do n't really see anything extraordinary . 
  just the regular bants the subreddit has about the us . 
  i 've given hungary & poland each ** far ** more shit than the us is getting in this whole thread , to be honest . 
   the way this story is depicted and dramatized basically makes it sound like the us , the country , claimed that it invented the sausage roll when really it was one single company in the us that just got bold with its advertising . 
  yes it 's not like the us is well known for news sources talking utter crap about europe either . 
  remember fox news ' reports on paris ? 
  or * your own president * talking about brussels ? 
  the us tends to be just as big a dick as we do in my opinion , you can choose to let that bother you , or you can choose to just live with it , move on , and enjoy things for their reality . 
  the us was invented by europe / s i do n't mind at all that you 're right , but i * do * mind your utter lack of respect , plus how entirely off topic you can get . 
  every damn time i see a picture like this from greece i always think about mirror 's edge ( the first one ) , which is a good thing because it 's * gorgeous * . 
   oh , i do n't stop at just gay couples . 
  for me the issues is that married couples gain certain rights in the eyes of the law . 
  for instance that they can share their income and that if only 1 partner works the taxes are reduced . 
  the same goes for health insurance costs , which the non working partner get 's free . 
  so you want less rights for married couples in general , and also less tax reductions on married couples which are a way to promote raising a family ( people with a bigger income get more motivated to have a family since financially it 's far less of a burden , works for gay people too because * adoption * ) . 
  as for health insurance costs , again , stability and financial success both promote family growing . 
   the reason why i ask the question is that in my view special rights that give people advantages should only be granted if they give back something which is advantageous for the general population .
