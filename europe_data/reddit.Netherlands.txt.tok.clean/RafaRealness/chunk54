  but that 's not how humans work , humans need to be * pushed * into being good and advantageous to the general population , you ca n't just say `` have kids and you 'll get all these advantages ! '', 
  because everyone will just look at what they will have now , look at how shitty it would be to have a kid , and just not do it , not to mention , what happens to women while pregnant who have n't had any kids yet ? 
  or pending adoption cases ? 
  these things take a tonne of time and patience ... also , if you believe that advantages should only be granted if people give back something which is advantageous for the general population , why do handicapped people deserve * any * advantage over non-handicapped people ? 
  and why do n't we just stop paying senior citizens their pensions , if they are not contributing to the general population ? 
  why do we have a welfare state at all to begin with ? 
  trade unions ? 
  a union of people based on their trade ? 
  a union of people who work ?

  so why is it that you let sterile couples get married ? 
  or people who do n't have and do n't want kids get hitched too ? 
  and why does marriage include benefits that do not at all revolve around making babies ? 
  why is it that * gay * couples is where the line is drawn ? 
  not only that , if gay adoption was made equal to straight-couple 's adoption , as well as legalize safe ways for artificial insemination , perhaps this would solve the odd issue you have with gays getting married . 
  ** scandinavia is full of dirty socialist commies , i 'm telling you ** / s, 
  i am at least 12 % sure that it is ancient swedish tradition to casually just take finland and sexually molest denmark . 
  considering the rest of this and every other thread . 
  ** yes we can !, 
  never heard of it nor in portugal , nor in france , nor in the netherlands . 
  i do n't think it 's a thing aside from your part of europe . 
  meanwhile , pride parades are something pretty much every european country knows ; and it 's now gon na be a thing on a tonne of places for a few days . 
  thus far i have n't seen any pinpas toilets here , it 's usually always loose change . 
  that sounds like so many steps , i 'd just like to grab my card or phone and pay via nfc . 
  i 'm lazy , i know . 
   i know that there is a certain xkcd comic used to reply to posts like this one , but people are fucking dumb . 
  no matter what the context is , no matter what time of the day it is , no matter what underwear i 'm wearing ... * there is * ** always ** * a relevant xkcd comic *, 
  considering that this is ** a space agency in poland ** i 'd say that over 2 million $ is quite a hefty sum to lose to * embezzlement * . 
  not to mention that 2.5 million $ is literally their average annual budget for the polsa : www.kpk.gov.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2-polsa-21-09-2016.pdf it is a gravely high amount in those terms . 
  if you see a mere name as a lack of respect , then what do you think of the football stadium songs * the dutch * sing that call it holland , and all the tv shows in * dutch television * that call it holland ? 
  again : are the dutch being disrespectful towards themselves as well ? 
  * this *, 
  oh really ? 
  send me half of that amount , please . 
  ... which is true . 
  the eu is * not * allowed to make any legislation . 
  what can happen is that the * individual member states * come up with legislation they themselves want to adopt at a union level and introduce it in a different process parallel to the eu 's usual legislation procedure . 
   you can even pay the usage of public toilets with creditcard . 
  ** for the first time ever i 'm heavily jealous of iceland ** seriously we pay everything with debit cards here in nl , i do n't even carry any notes with me at all ; * yet for some odd reason * our bathrooms require coins and it 's just such a goddamn hassle i swear ... 
  for those wondering : 10\u00a0000\u00a0000 z\u0142 is the same as : 2 365 876.02 $ or 2 080 387.60 # quite a hefty amount i 'd say . 
  nah , you 're not stupid . 
  the daily mail is utter trash , i 'm pretty sure britons know it too to be honest . 
  the difference is that union-wide decisions regarding the banning of fgm require * all * member states to be onboard with it and also need to be in accordance with the teu and the tfeu . 
  since fgm already was highly condemned all over europe , this made it * far * easier to make this a europe-wide stance against it . 
  however , the same can not ( unfortunately ) be said for unnecessary child circumcision ; which is even common practice for some areas of europe and does not have a big stance against it . 
  should unnecessary child circumcision genuinely face such an opposition and our politicians finally take the steps to end the practice , chances are we 'd see something similar from the eu . 
  however i still believe it is incredulously unfair to blame the eu for doing nothing , when the eu is * designed * not to act on areas it is not asked to . 
  the day the eu intervenes in , say , public education , is the day we 're going to have a * huuuuge * lawsuit again ( remember when the eu got shunned for trying to ban tobacco advertising a few years ago ? ), 
  ... and here we see someone who thinks the eu can just do whatever the heck it wants ... 
  if you take the time it takes to read up on how the eu works ( even just the two main treaties ) , you 'd notice something called the principle of conferral . 
  the eu is ** not ** allowed to make ** any ** legislation on areas where it does not have any competence , and this includes medical legislation ; hence why there is no eu-wide abortion law either . 
  i 'd blame our national politicians , of the 28 member states , who have not done this yet is their competence to do so , or at least grant competence to the eu to pass the appropriate legislation . 
  excuse you , * we 're * the ones below sea level .

  this is not a trickle , much less a stream . 
  to claim french citizenship you must have resided in france legally for a minimum of 5 years ; which these applicants have . 
  the same people from the uk who already have lived in france since * at least * 2012 are applying for french citizenship . 
  what exactly does this change ? 
  in practice , virtually nothing , they can just carry on with their lives peacefully in france as they did ages before brexit was ever a thing . 
  ... well to be granted french citizenship by naturalization you must have legally lived in france for 5 uninterrupted years . 
  they already have . 
  are they dancing ?

  they have the money , and they want these products . 
  if it makes them happy and they can afford it , why not ? 
  estonians have the highest alcohol consumption in the world according to the oecd , so why are estonians wasting so much money on booze ??

  that makes sense to me , and it seems like a good compromise , though i can still imagine various mechanisms that montenegro can use to not * produce * euro currency but still take financial matters into their hands . 
  makes sense to me , though i 'm really unfamiliar with just how the eu 's stance on montenegro 's and kosovo 's usage is , all i know is that they disapprove and discourage it . 
  yeah , hence why i 'm really interested in how talks about it are gon na go about . 
  perhaps if montenegro used another eu country 's currency that * is * in erm ii while they work on being fit for the euro that might work ? 
  i am really curious to see how the whole talks will go in general . 
  they threw the nhs under the bus apparently . 
  ** yes i 've been waiting to use that expression for quite a long time deal with it i am happy . 
  i 'd like to see how accession talks evolve for those two , especially regarding the euro ; since montenegro already uses it , it might be an interesting chat ( or just a `` well alright now you are part of the eurozone officially i guess '' ), 
  oh fuck , i was there just yesterday . 
  makes sense , i do n't really see it changing either . 
  why not add some green ? 
  okay , genuine question and please do n't kill me but : * in the hypothetical case * either scotland or northern ireland bolt out of the uk , would the union jack still have the blue and the red x-cross ? 
  i 'm gon na have to call ** maaasssive ** bullshit on these .

  yes , i agree with you that it was definitely not nuanced enough . 
  i also agree that the sole solution to it is leaving/not joining the efta , yes . 
  we 're on the same page on that . 
  i also understand that norway is going to use it , but that 's been said before and unperformed ( such as the norwegian veto on new power regulations that evaporated one day later ) and it is also something so tiny , so small , so precise , that i doubt will actually make an impact on any functioning of the internal market ; and thus does not really ring any alarm bells for anyone .
