  in that case yes , you can buy them at any airport for pretty cheap , and they will work all over the eu with no extra charges . 
  yes , i agree , norway still has a say in those laws , however it is merely consultancy at best . 
  i think that his main point is that norway is merely consulted and holds a veto that has yet to be used due to the massive shit they 'd get should it be a detriment to the eu ; whereas member states have far more representation and a say on how these laws function and apply . 
  norway gets no say on the european council , the council of ministers , the commission , nor the parliament ; it merely is asked its opinion on it like switzerland . 
  yes , you are consulted about any new regulations that have an effect over norway ( say , a new standard for cigarette packages ) but for most you 're not really checked with because you basically do your own thing . 
  furthermore , you * can * veto implementation in norway ( not in the eu ) which thus far i believe never happened and it would also result in a pretty hefty situation to deal with the eu itself .

  quelle surprise !, 
  what for ? 
  there are no roaming fees anymore between eu member states . 
  if you still want to do so , you can very easily buy a data card in relay or ako for cheap . 
  they are very easy to find . 
  where does the family get any input ? 
  thanks !, 
  ( sorry for any dutch mistakes , i 'm still trying my best to learn it ), 
  well my first instinct is to say `` terrorist brit '' but i thought * okay maybe scale it down *, 
  i think that yes , some people may correct you , and i think that considering i do n't know every single person in the netherlands ( i 'm not stasi nor do i have that talent ) then there 's always room for people who view it differently . 
  based on what you said , i think we 're both on the same page and generally dutch people do n't really fully care if you call it holland or the netherlands . 
  as you said , it is a `` well , actually ... '' moment , which is pretty innocent . 
  what 's res ? 
  i did n't really have high hopes for a peace march , though i agree it 's quite disappointing regardless . 
  i hate to say it , i 'm saddened but also not surprised ?

   lol what , a lot of people mind . 
  everywhere except holland minds . . where did you get that idea from ? 
  the only province/region outside of holland that would n't mind are utrecht and flevoland ... from living in most provinces and discussing this pretty often with people because it 's a subject that interests me . 
  thus far the biggest real opposition i 've ever met to it was in leeuwarden where a young couple basically said `` i do n't like it , but i do n't care '' . 
   people here will absolutely correct you whenever you try to use holland/netherlands interchangeably yet in sports as well as tv shows * in dutch * the same is done ... again , i severely doubt that based on all the observations i 've read and heard thus far on the matter .

  you 're right , the eu also has the power to push through with regulations and directives , though these are also under the say of the council of ministers as well as the european parliament , so they still have to go through both governments and the popular vote to get by . 
  this area of competence , making the paris agreement legally binding , already seems completely out of area as to what the eu has the power to pass by itself according to teu and tfeu , so yes , it will need to go through each member state 's individual governments , though [ according to this tracker ] ( https://cait.wri.org/source/ratification/#?lang=en ) all of the eu is already either a signatory of the agreement , or becoming so . 
  yes , though the conceptual aspect of it is n't a * direct * mirror of what the words nederland means in dutch . 
  holland conveys more of a cultural aspect connected to it than nederland does ; just like * koninkrijk der nederlanden * does n't have at all the same connotation . 
  i 'm not trying to make a case about anything . 
  i am literally just saying that the term `` holland '' in english is used to reference to the netherlands , and that everybody i 've ever met who * is * dutch really does n't give a crap about it and some even use it themselves out of habit in english . 
  our tourism agencies themselves call it holland , the tourists call it holland , some sports fans call it holland , and thus far the * two * people who genuinely seem to care about this to the tiniest extent is you and another user on this subreddit . 
  it 's like hearing a korean bitch about korea being actually called hanguk , or a finn saying the rightful name for their country is suomi . 
   i can tell you do not live in limburg been there too , have n't met a single person who said otherwise . 
  unless you 're not dutch and have been taught to use the two words interchangeably . 
  in danish the word for the netherlands literally * is * holland , and in english the two are often mistaken thus generating a different conception of the word holland . 
  you could say the same thing for calling the us `` america '' for example . 
  it merely is not the whole continent , or calling the eu `` europe '' . 
  common language usage is not really accurate on multiple accounts , this does not seem to pose a problem to anyone i know here except for 2 people on reddit . 
   well , let me put it this way . 
  if the uk continues to participate in pr\u00fcm -- looks like this is data-sharing for law enforcement , which i imagine could be useful post-brexit -- then it certainly seems reasonable to expect the uk to pay obligations for pr\u00fcm . 
  i do n't think that anyone is going to argue otherwise in that situation . 
  exactly , so we 're on the same page . 
   if the uk does not participate in pr\u00fcm , and if pr\u00fcm does not have an explicit withdrawal plan set of guarantees , then i 'd assume that it 's a question for negotiations . 
  that is , i do n't think saying `` it 's not a part of the eu , so the uk needs to pay '' is clearly the case , though maybe i 'm misunderstanding you . 
  i could see either the uk paying or not paying . 
  i think you misunderstand me in part , what i believe is that commitments were made to pr\u00fcm , as well as other projects , which thus far are to be continued since the uk has yet to comment on any of those . 
   well , i 'm no expert on the specifics of the agreements . 
  but my assumption is that basically , the eu is saying `` when you sign up for x , it 's like signing up for a contract . 
  you pay for non-performance in a contract . '', 
  well , yes , but * only * to the extent that you have already fully given your word by signing and ratifying the documentation that explicitly basically says `` we * will * pay for this & that '' . 
  without it , the payments would be * far * more negotiable and up for debate . 
   and the uk is saying `` but there 's a process for withdrawal on these , and if i withdraw , it 's comparable to an escape clause '' . 
  yes , that is true , but that does not escape all other adjacent documentation which is the precise documentation that is causing the eu to be so hard-line with the issue . 
   my guess is that if the uk does want to leave pr\u00fcm -- and i 've no idea whether it does -- the uk 's gon na say `` okay , i excercised my right to leave , and so i 'm no longer bound by any obligations that were part of pr\u00fcm '' . 
  * assuming the uk indeed wants to leave pr\u00fcm fully * , the uk will no longer be bound by any obligations related to the treaties , however due to previous agreement and commitment to fund developing areas of pr\u00fcm ( such as investigations ) that need to be taken to its completion , it is * far * harder for the uk to evade those costs due to already promising and engaging payment . 
  ** i will take you by surprise **, 
  corruption , shunning the gays , fucking up women 's rights ... goddamn . 
  i 'd consider it so , yes , meanwhile here the provinces pretty much all just are the netherlands and are happy this way ( maybe with the teeny minority in friesland who does n't like it but oh well ) . 
  ooooh , sorry , did n't get the reference . 
  ceaucescu is having a goddamn * rave * in his grave jesus christ . 
  so far i 've found * one * person who genuinely cares , and i only found him here on reddit . 
  make that what you will , i think maybe it 's different for the netherlands because there is less of a difference between our provinces than there is between , say , england and scotland . 
  username checks out . 
  we love you back . 
  i joined because my romanian friends explained to me the situation and if that were my country i 'd be pissed . 
  that 's the romanian minister of justice , apparently deflecting * every damn question * like he 's in the matrix , concerning the controversial laws trying to be passed . 
  well , he has google , and now if he did n't know at least he knows . 
  so it 's fine . 
  * in dutch * , as i said , in dutch there is a different conception of the word `` holland '' refers to . 
  i 've never heard someone in dutch use holland to refer to nederland itself , aside from sports events ( which i do n't watch though i probably should ) . 
  in english , as you speak to dutch people , a lot of them ( be it from noord en zuid holland or utrecht or groningen or whichever province ) sometimes use the term `` holland '' just like foreigners do . 
  really ? 
  i had a whole sign about it when i joined the romanian protests in amsterdam : [ alta intrebare , sorry , mispelled ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe7ps_hy_ac ), 
  ... again , tourists call it holland , tonnes of countries call it holland , even dutch people speaking english sometimes call it holland . 
  why and how are you so amazingly offended by this ? 
  i 've yet to hear a finn bitch about how finland 's actual name is `` suomi '' or an englishman bitch about the term `` england '' being used instead of `` uk '', 
  allow me to quote my favorite romanian meme : ** alta intrebare !?? 
  well , i 'd disagree , since there * are * lots of people who call it holland but i never hear someone call the us `` dakota '' i mean , the truth is that holland is * not * the correct term for the whole country ( only two provinces ) but everyone calls us holland and it does n't seem to bother most people . 
  plus in a lot of languages people use their equivalent to `` holland '' more often than `` the netherlands '' so it really is just a technical thing . 
  we call the eu `` europe '' , we call the us `` america '' we call , the netherlands `` holland '' , it 's just small linguistic misconceptions ; similar to how the word `` state '' and `` nation '' are sometimes used interchangeably by journalists . 
  ... okay so dutch people are disrespectful to themselves ? 
  that 's something i 've learned today . 
   my understanding is that there is a dispute over whether-or-not and to what degree the uk is on the hook for paying for something that it would have paid after it leaves the eu . 
  yes , this is true . 
  the dispute , however , seems to be mainly a problem within the media since the uk has n't really made much of a statement regarding anything about it yet .
