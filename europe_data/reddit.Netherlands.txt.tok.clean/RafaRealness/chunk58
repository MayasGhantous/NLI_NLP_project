  however i still believe that our current system , though perhaps the best we 've got so far , is flawed , and thus it would be good to have some discussion over alternatives that do not at all endanger the efficiency nor the safety of international communications and diplomats , but also provide a better answer to the problem of court evasion . 
   rude as it may seem , compared to the shit-storm of other systems thus far tried , yes it is working . 
  what other systems ? 
  i 'm genuinely unaware . 
   some countries do not have the grace to waive immunity in cases like this . 
  germany/eu can sanction arabia , end treaties , etc. . 
  it 's politics , unfortunately . 
  i think it 's a very worrying state of affairs because it 's no secret that we 're very big clients of saudi arabia , and thus we depend on them . 
  so if this does n't pass i do n't think we can fully go against them ... 
  yes , because the alternative clearly is working out according to this article . 
   but what about investing in education if you need skilled workers with a 10 % unemployment rate ? 
  already underway , as well as multiple programmes for reinsertion within the labor market of this 10 % . 
  keep in mind that nearly all of these people wil not be able to undergo * years and years and years * of post-bac studies ( which they can freely do since it 's * free to go to university * ) . 
   he was elected to help the french , was he not ? 
  this does n't really help the french . 
  ... except it does . 
  french companies , startups in particular , need highly skilled workers in order to take on important roles to develop and reinvigorate the french economy and production . 
  a better economy can later help france grow , as well as these startups , to provide jobs ( as well as taxes that then can be invested into public infrastructure and programmes ) for france . 
  france * needs * to give new life to its economy in order to solve the unemployment problem ; france is doing so by investing in startups as well as attract the creative talent of the world to develop newer products and be more competitive . 
  why the fuck did i move to the netherlands . 
  shit . 
  ** brb moving to vilnius to learn all this holy shit **, 
   that internationally accepted set is the vienna convention and is working . 
  civilized countries regularly waive immunity in serious cases in countries that have a working legal system . 
  countries that do n't should be punished collectively until they start . 
  based on what we 're seeing in this article , can we say it is working well enough ? 
   you can put the un human right council on that i 'm sure chairman saudi arabia will give you a fair trail . 
  that was a mistake from the start in my books . 
   the problem with that idea is that most of un members are not good countries that value the rule of law . 
  tinpot dictators will outvote you half of the time for some nice bribes . 
  this for me is the challenges it 'll face , though if it becomes slowly practiced between the free and democratic countries first , slowly making its way into the lesser free and less democratic states , slowly becoming a standard , it could perhaps work . 
   that is not a goal of the diplomatic conventions . 
  the goal is to allow diplomatic relations between countries to happen with little friction is more valuable to everybody then justice in personal cases . 
  a man got killed and there is a chance that there will not be a fair trial . 
  this is not something unique either , there are multiple cases of abuse of diplomatic immunity . 
  i 'd say that there * is * already friction over it . 
  france is very attractive within the eu , but it is not france who chooses , it 's the eu citizens , and they have 27 countries to freely choose from within the eu , so not all are going to france . 
  france wants more highly skilled workers , america 's new administration fails to impress the scientific community , and there is lots of highly qualified individuals who perhaps would like to move to france . 
  this makes it easier for the * highly educated * 3rd country nationals to move to france . 
   it is similar to the chinese tones but significantly more simple . 
  ** internal screaming from flashbacks **  if you 're into indo-european languages lithuanian in general is going to be very useful because it 's the language that is closest to the proto indo european language . 
  especially the lithuanian dialects are . 
  wait , really ? 
  * how ? 
  * i mean , how do we even know , that 's actually mindblowing . 
  yes , eu citizens can already freely come to france if they want to . 
  the tourbon law may make functioning on another foreign language * very * difficult , i 'm afraid . 
  i mean , they bitched and prosecuted software for not being in french ( not joking ) . 
  again , i am not saying no to * any and all * immunity . 
  i merely believe that immunity needs limitations and rules to prevent these types of cases . 
   do you have a proposition how to get them to respect immunity when we would n't ? 
  assuming the us or eu could actually enforce one sided immunity directly what about all the small countries that need to deal with their corrupt neighbors ? 
  * in the case of diplomats * i imagine that an internationally enforced and accepted set of limitations and rules over diplomatic immunity should exist , specifically for these cases . 
   drumming up murder charges by a corrupt regime is only marginally more difficult then drumming up simpler charges . 
  beside this was not murder , do n't misrepresent it . 
  i believe that an internationally accepted board of analysts should be in charge of determining these cases . 
  a body of the un in charge of reviewing evidence put forth by the local authorities whom have put severe charges ( such as homicide ) and see if they are valid * or * if they are not , the immediate and safe deportation of that diplomat ( and adjacent family ) back to their home country . 
  for the simpler smaller stuff ( traffic infractions and whatnot , as long as they do not develop into something more sinister ) the current standard can be applied . 
   the rules were set up so there will be no negotiation with every tin pot dictator and no going back on any of the promises . 
  otherwise there would be a diplomatic incident each day . 
  by basically saying `` okay do n't obey the rules then '' ? 
  we already have incidents with diplomatic immunity alarmingly often with some countries ( the saudi 's princess comes to mind ) and there is no real answer given . 
  whereas if we just debat a bit a system to guarantee that justice is serviced no matter what and set precedents and standards for these procedures , perhaps we could move on from this broken system . 
  yep , the echr definitely benefited a lot from british lawyers and experts . 
  again , the uk is just going through some rough times , brexit is n't easy no matter what you do . 
  well , it 's not always a dickhead , rest assured . 
  the uk made a lot of * good * things in the past as well . 
  it 's just that when it comes to eu integration it 's not its thing and now with the whole brexit thing ... yeah things are complicated . 
  also , your country = / = your government . 
  fuck theresa may but the uk is still awesome in my books . 
  no , i still am betting in just the uk . 
  denmark is in the erm ii after all . 
  no you are just putting words in my mouth . 
  i never said that we should at all cut diplomatic ties * nor * send unprotected people there . 
  what i did say is that the current system is obviously broken , and needs to be revised . 
  both sides need to be protected as to certify that they are safe be it in germany , poland , saudi arabia , north korea etc. . . but also to certify that you do not get a chance to ** literally get away with murder ** should you kill someone in your host country and be expelled back . 
  tl ; dr is an option for politics too . 
  ** i was elected to lead , not read **, 
  schr\u00f6dinger 's eu , it simultaneously is : 1 - an evil oppressing harsh dictatorship controlled by brussels/germans taking away your sovereignty and freedoms and money . 
  2 - a loose , powerless , cowardly system that ca n't do anything properly and is already too weak to continue existing . 
  i would but it 's not like saudi arabia chooses its own royal family ( which hold diplomatic immunity ) , plus i doubt they care much about sending someone competent here as long as their goals are being properly served . 
  i think this is worthy of more debate , the current system seems * very * abuse-prone . 
  perhaps if there were an international code of conduct for diplomats , we could establish a better system . 
  i know , and i think we are definitely tied to them unfortunately , as you said , oil and such . 
  however , why do we need on-ground diplomats under such a system that allows them to basically have a `` get out of jail '' card ? 
  is there * seriously * no utter better way to deal with this ? 
  if genuinely these countries can not be trusted with the safety and the application of the rule of law and justice of our own diplomats within their country why would we send diplomats there to begin with ? 
  i believe that diplomatic ties to these countries are inevitable ( unfortunately , oil and such ) but i do * not * see why we can not avoid giving a free pass to their diplomats . 
  so this man in the article * may * not even be trialed to begin with ? 
  let 's imagine i 'm a diplomat from country 1 . 
  in my country , i am allowed to beat women like dogs . 
  i am going to country 2 , where such a practice is illegal , and will proceed to do so . 
  the * sole * thing that will happen to me is getting expelled and trialed then ? 
  that is why i think that for the offenses that are mistake-prone , there maybe should be such a system in place , just for the sake of efficiency . 
  small offenses sure , but bigger ones * never * . 
  however for ** literally killing a cyclist ** there should be absolutely no escape from justice . 
  it is not very accidental to blatantly murder someone . 
  if i am going to be a diplomat going into a foreign country , why the hell am i special and above the law ? 
  i * must * inform myself prior to it , know what is/isn ' t allowed over there , and then go . 
  to federalization ?
