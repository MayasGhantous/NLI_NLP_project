  ** to gay space automated communism !? 
  i might give lithuanian a try . 
  my goal is to learn a language of each family in europe . 
  thus far i know 4 romance languages , 3 germanic ones , and 1 slavic language . 
  finnish might be next , or lithuanian ( sorry latvia ), 
   basically different countries have different rules and you do n't want your diplomat to be prosecuted for something that is not an offense in your country . 
  this is the part i do n't understand . 
  why not ? 
  i would like there to be diplomats from yemen , but if one tries to marry and have sex with a 10-year old , i would * very * much consider it essential that he faces justice . 
  sounds interesting , thanks for explaining !, 
  hit me !, 
  i am slightly closer to my favorite thing about lithuania then : surelis !, 
  ( sorry i do n't have the - over the u in this keyboard ) edit : why is illative considered `` other '' ? 
  someone eli5 the purpose of diplomatic immunity , and why it is n't immunity against * certain * accusations . 
  it 's true , though i still love learning about different languages . 
  just the concept of having different cases via the ending , and modifying the noun itself was entirely unbeknownst to me until frigging russian happened , hehe . 
  is there any rule for - \u0117 , - a , and - is ? 
  rafael ( - as ), 
  it 's so weird , because in my native language ( portuguese ) - as is usually a suffix for feminine plural nouns , it 's like the direct complete opposite . 
  hehehehe . 
  ** do n't kill me but ** in russian , for foreign words ( like \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e ) there is no ending for the cases , so it all just sounds the same ; this also applies to foreign names . 
  in lithuanian , would my name have an - as suffix added to it ? 
  ooooh so it 's maybe animate ? 
  because my lithuanian friend 's name ends with an \u0117, 
  a europhile in the streets , a eurofreak in the sheets , eh ? 
  i think it looks even worse . 
  it is more visually busy , it looks like an eye-examination test , and what the heck is the point/symbology of having a big circle in the middle with a red + on it ? 
  did n't you * just * join 4 years ago ? 
  my money is on the uk . 
  this is n't about blaming her at all , it 's about her avoiding survivors of the fire . 
  imagine that the norwegian pm would just actively avoid survivors from ut\u00f8ya right after it happened ... 
  it * would * leave quite a sour note . 
   do i have to join anti-nazi protests in germany in order to be considered a good german ? 
  nah , you just need to arbeiten !, 
  what about that \u00e9 that instead of \u00b4 has a ball on top of it ? 
  is it a female nominative ending too ? 
  still , i think it 's a debate worth having . 
  norway would pay the biggest contribution if they joined the eu , but they also are a very small country ( population wise ) so they would be less represented in parliament as it is not based on money . 
  furthermore norway loves its own unsubmitted democracy and the efta status allows it to leave far more easily if it ever wants to just stop obeying regulations and be fully sovereign again . 
  there 's lots to be discussed about the pros and cons, 
  well i know one simple solution to that problem ... 
  i think that 's correct , yeah . 
  though you also pay less contributions , and can better protect your fishing industries . 
  it 's a very interesting debate if norway should ( or not ) join the eu . 
  yep , same here . 
  it seems something truly beneficial for all member states , i 'll try to look up why some did n't join . 
  edit : seems like portugal , greece , sweden and italy have already stated they 'd like to join pr\u00fcm . 
  the uk has special treatment ( surprise surprise ) . 
  they basically * cooperate and co-decide * with pr\u00fcm but have an opt-out for it specifically ... norway and iceland have their own deal where they are basically a semi-part of pr\u00fcm , not having to follow all of it ; and switzerland and liechtenstein have their own deal as well . 
  ** latvias & lietuvas when are you joining ??? 
  how much time did it take you to prepare for such a huge trip ? 
  did you have any expectations for it ? 
  were they met ? 
  did this make you see europe differently ? 
   we signed up for trade union , economic union ... you joined in 2004 . 
  it already was * not * that . 
  if you really did , you 'd be in the eea . 
  * excuse you * i 'm google voice . 
  ** are you cheating on me with another smartphone !? 
  i think perhaps the available definition of what/who was looked up to changed . 
  young people like rebels , that 's something we see in every generation . 
  in my parent 's time it was cool to be that guy/girl who smoked cigs , drank alcohol , broke the rules , had fun , etc. . . the general 70s , 80s celeb for teens . 
  in my generation , however , the `` cool guys '' are hipsters and such . 
  alcohol does n't seem to be a huge thing , it does n't hold the same symbol of rebellion as it once did , thus it stopped attracting younger crowds as the rebellious choice . 
  instead , nowadays the rebellious thing is more focused on fashion choices like haircuts or also a know-it-all attitude , it became cool to be brainier and thus younger people of my generation may have been more conducted towards it . 
  this , of course , is just how i see it , and this is all not a definitive truth . 
  very informative , thanks !, 
  to our irish friends : any idea how this might turn out ? 
  is it controversial ? 
  what 's the general context of this new referendum ? 
  1-not broken , fractured , or damaged . 
  2-not interrupted or disturbed ; continuous . 
  can you imagine a series like friends but it 's just dragnea and stuff ? 
  i do n't know how to pour myself a beer either ... 
  mainly because i do n't like beer ( or drinking in general , maybe some vodka shots at parties but eh ) . 
  ** me for president 2020 move over kanye **, 
  oh , sorry , i misread the graph !, 
  i 've always wished for a european ( continental ) version of house of cards . 
  romania fucking * delivered * yo . 
  i think that this one does n't show the spike because it does not display 2003 . 
  this one displays data for years that are even numbers ( every two years basically ) which skips it . 
  interestingly it shows another spike in 1996 for \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c . 
  edit : nvm i 'm just bad at reading graphs . 
  maybe this is our secret devious evil eurocrat plan to steal scotland and reunite ireland . 
  ** laughs in european ** / s, 
  some carriers abolished the roaming charges earlier , mine , for example , abolished them on the 13th . 
  this day is ** the ** day where from now on roaming within the eu is not allowed . 
  thus this is ** the ** day carriers must ultimately have abolished their roaming fees . 
   i thought that this post would get better reception ( pun intended ) underrated . 
  oh damn , that 's actually really interesting . 
  so basically macedonia calls itself macedonia and uses cultural elements from the past of macedon . 
  claims this is okay . 
  meanwhile greece , which also has a huge chunk of it called macedonia disagrees , especially because there are people in greece that identify as macedonian but entirely unrelated to the republic of macedonia ; thus it does not believe that the `` stealing '' of such cultural elements is appropriate nor warranted . 
  i am trying to just sum it up as unbiased as i can . 
   tried it , did n't like it , left it . 
  grow up and stop whining europe . 
  you could have left in 1975 but the referendum failed . 
  you have yet to leave and thus far your shite leadership has yet to fully start negotiations and get on with it . 
  you `` tried '' it for 44 years , constantly avoiding most motions for further integration * and * asking for special treatment , and criticizing the institutions for aspiring to develop a political union , which was * from the very beginning written in paper very clearly * the whole purpose of the eec , later becoming the ec , and eventually the eu . 
  the uk clearly was against the project , its government did not want to join initially to begin with ( or are you forgetting how the uk was called the `` sick man of europe '' before ? ) .
