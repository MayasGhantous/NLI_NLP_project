  thanks for the help !, 
  ... i do n't get it ? 
  i think they are talking about those cringe-worthy 40/50 year old frenchies that are commenting dumb shit like that . 
  they are a very very small minority ( barely noticed them , but once you find one you find a bunch ) but they are kinda funny for the wrong reasons . 
  poland actually surprised me ... 
  i mean , really ? 
  poland out of all places ? 
  this is actually a pretty interesting map , and i 'm glad to see that there is no black spots left in europe . 
  glad they found wally ? 
  [ i 'm pretty sure i have a picture of him ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ntawwduwma==/z/e8eaaoxy63fsuls8/$_3.jpg?set_id=2 ), 
  that sounds far better tbh , and i was considering access to the european market as a full access to the common market like the efta . 
  but a free trade deal definitely seems better for both sides . 
  thanks !, 
  i agree , if we bend to the uk 's will on this , we will likely start destroying the eu at an amazing and scary speed . 
  nobody will want to follow all rules and before you know it we 're all divided again ... what 's next ? 
  we need to rename the eu to `` the british empire '' ? 
  if the uk would just accept freedom of movement ( which from what i can see , it 's quite a big issue ) then access to the common market could be arranged ( well , if norway does n't veto the uk getting into the efta ) . 
  how should this be handled in your opinion ? 
   magma : \u02c8ma\u0261m\u0259 / ; hot fluid or semi-fluid material below or within the earth 's crust from which lava and other igneous rock is formed on cooling . 
  yes , yes it does . 
  as is tradition of playing cs : go in europe , that little lad now must learn the ways of the russian and scream : \u0420\u0410\u0428\u0411\u0418 \u0421\u0423\u041a\u0410 \u0412\u041b\u042f\u0414\u042c !!, 
  ah yes , the solution to violent unruly acts is to answer them by doing the same but double-time ... yep , that never back fired . ^ / s, 
  i do n't mean aggressive as in `` let 's kill everyone else '' , i just really enjoy [ this type of wording , which sometimes it 's needed ] ( http://www.diarioliberdade.org/archivos/administradores/maur%c3%adcio/2015-09/archivos/administradores/manu/2015-07/150915_queselixe.jpeg ) my absolute favourite goes to [ this one ] ( http://galizacontrainfo.org/sites/default/files/imaxes_blogue/2011/10/lisboa-_um_povo_sem_medo_eis_o_segredo_-_indymedia_portugal.jpg ) though . 
  i just really like the fact that the slogans that i 've seen when i lived there often were like this , and i think it 's something cool . 
  that is often true , and something i really appreciate , i just really enjoy the pretty aggressive slogans sometimes . 
  i would n't be surprised either , but at least they sound quite nice , and they are ( to an extent , and this is just my opinion ) quite accurate for a lot of the population . 
  i see us as kinda a very small community , which definitely has problems , but we also have a lot of particular characteristics that i think i never appreciated until i did n't have them anymore . 
  we 're sorta very connected to our literature , and also tend to travel a lot , as well as ~ ~ occupying ~ ~ living in specific places abroad , like canada , australia , france , switzerland , and luxembourg . 
  true , although once i remember there was an emergency landing in rome made by a flight going from porto to istanbul because two idiots actively started fighting in the cabin over football ( one was cheering porto , the other one benfica ) that news story right there is by far my favorite xd, 
  ... until , of course , it comes to manifestations or football . 
  i really really want 24h metro service in amsterdam ... 
  i work and often hang out in centrum , but the metro stations close at midnight , so every bloody time i have to cinderella my ass back home ... 
  [ i am terribly sorry but i had to do this ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82opnxuf0ks ), 
  do atheists really care about this sort of thing ? 
  i mean , i 've never met any who actually would actively seek for this but ... well , whatever gets sweden off late at night i guess . 
  it lightly remids me of those fedora-wearing type dudes who ramble about [ ** euphooooooria ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4njcmlmb5to ) and whatnot, 
  it is true that wallonia has the power to refuse it ... but in my opinion , it is better for the eu to accept the ceta in general ... open question to anyone : how could we have a democratic approach but still also have a better deal out of all this ? 
  ( feels a bit ridiculous to turn that deal down because of one small region ), 
  i always heard about the stereotype that belgians had a slight tendency to prefer ... `` fresh '' company . 
  you sir just made my night that bit funnier . 
  yeah , but the fun side is bringing your foreign friends through lisbon and show them all the communist symbols in their adverts ( and translate them too if they are particularly ... `` red '' ) bonus points if you also take them to festa do avante . 
  [ the lyrics are just too beautiful , even if i must admit it 's a bit depressing as well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgqej6bqrli ) the lyrics ( translated ) are : if a seagull would come bring me the sky of lisbon as i imagined it - that sky where the gaze is a wing that does n't fly it exhausts itself and falls into the sea ---------------------------- what a perfect heart in my chest it would beat my love in your hand in that hand where it would fit perfectly my heart -------------------------------- if a portuguese seaman hiker from the seven seas would be , who knows , the first to tell me what he 'd make up if a gaze of new shine in my gaze would entwine --------------------------------- what a perfect heart in my chest it would beat my love in your hand in that hand where it would fit perfectly my heart perfectly my heart perfectly my heart, 
  i really wan na find out more about czechia , it 's such a lovely place and the little bit of history i know about it truly is fascinating ( also , to an extent slovakia too ) but i also want to learn more about finland and the baltics , they are all so different from each other and i feel like they are really awesome to visit , but i just do n't know much about them at all ... 
  that is something i 've noticed . 
  when i lived in portugal our trash can was * always * just on the floor somewhere a bit out the way , but also in its own little space dedicated to the specific purpose of trash can containment . 
  when i moved to france , our trash can was just under the sink and i was a bit weirded out by the placement but i never really questioned it and eventually got used to it . 
  now in the netherlands , my trash can is below the sink , but my friend 's is in its own special area ... you 're asking the real questions that actually amazed me to just notice * that * difference goddamn . 
  i 've heard that many . 
  many times ... all my friends whom have been there tell me it 's actually amazing and super fun to visit . 
  i thought this was a joke , but no . 
  this fucking subreddit exists . 
  that 's enough for today , goodnight . 
  it 's a growing problem in amsterdam too . 
  the city itself already has very expensive rent , but people illegally use airbnb to rent it out to people when they are not there and more and more it 's impossible to get proper housing in amsterdam ... 
  i hate to say it , but airbnb needs to be severely toned down or entirely thrown out the picture , because its current state is creating a mess on housing . 
  trust me , there are far better looking than them here in amsterdam ( and yes i 'm talking about the ones with * that * profession ) . 
  so do n't be shy and pay a visit to the real professionals . 
  that actually sounds like a good solid definition , thanks !, 
  i feel like this is a thing a lot of people forget alarmingly often , and i fully agree , that there still are problems with western europeans . 
  in all honesty this comment is really well written , like , yeah it 's exactly that . 
  for me the problem is n't exactly muslims , the problem is bigots and hateful idiots using islam as a coverup , which goes both ways . 
  if you actively hate me for being gay , it 's not because you 're a muslim , it 's because you also happen to be homophobic ( and that , of course , is not exclusive to any religion or even atheism ) if you actively hate me for being [ insert religion here ] it 's much of the same . 
  that 's true , sadly . 
  i was educated elsewhere ( so it would n't be your fault , do n't worry , and from what i can see you 've got very good education ) my dutch is still a bit bad , and i understood that they were over 200 % more likely to commit suicide , which i was like `` uhm , i do n't think so '' but now that you pointed out that the rate is more than 200 % ... oh my dear god it just got even better . 
  first of all , i literally just got to this country , and that was n't my call to do ... 
  i have no idea what you 're aiming at , are you saying that i brought middle easterners here ? 
  or that i should not be surprised by religious anti- [ blank ] pamphlets in one of the world 's most tolerant cities ? 
  not at all , i 'm saying that i 'm surprised that there would be such a pamphlet being dished out to mailboxes , no matter if it 's islamic , christian , or jewish . 
  grab them right by the ... kitten ? 
   wtf is his organisation doing in amsterdam ? 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  coming to think of it , yeah you might be right , and russia 's case truly is ... my god where do we even begin on that ? 
  it gets better , the leaflet goes on about how gay people are more likely to get depressed and commit suicide . 
  although i highly disagree with the percentages they give us , i think that it might be true for some countries ( like the us ) * where gay people are often discriminated against *, 
  your username makes your comment even better , well played . 
  my feels . 
  i specifically went into the comments section expecting to find that , and by god i was not disappointed . 
  i kinda see where it comes from , and i think that for me it 's just that amsterdam is the last place i 'd think for something like this ( which is probably why they thought it was the perfect location ) . 
  is this sort of thing against dutch law ? 
  edit : apparently it 's not a christian group but an islamic creationist one , but honestly i think that the context remains much the same, 
  i 'm not dutch ( sorry , newly arrived here ) and using religion as an argument for anything political or social nowadays tends to freak me out a bit . 
  i 'm a bit conflicted though , i 'm not sure where the line between inticing hatred and just exercising freedom of expression is , but in either case i was quite shocked when i saw one of these from a friend who got this in her mailbox, 
  portugal is quite a smaller country , nearly all concerts happen in lisbon ( it 's very easy to get there from anywhere except ~ ~ our colonies ~ ~ the islands ), 
  check the comments section on that link , it 's quite the caps lock fantasia we all grew to love at times . 
  i showed this to some of my colleagues , they all just sighed and just stared into the distance . 
  i feel we 're all feeling the same way : `` where do i even begin with this ... '', 
  i genuinely went to look at all the things that have chocolate in my kitchen ( i 'm bored as hell and in this country 30 % of every food is chocolate ) . 
  could n't find anything remotely similar to the term , but i did read that nearly all of them did n't have `` chocolate '' in it either , instead they listed the components inside chocolate itself ... maybe this was an easy work-around ? 
  oh dear ... before the brexit big badaboom took over , what were we all talking about ? 
  ukraine ? 
  first of , he is not a country and this is not ww1 . 
  what this is though , is an agency trying to promote hate inside ourselves to keep fuelling what aids them brainwash these people into terrorist actions . 
  this `` demographic takeover '' fear does n't really seem plausible once you actually study that statistically terrorists are an extremely tiny percentage of all middle eastern people , but if we start being idiots who believe that they are all sneaky and evil , obviously we are going to have an issue . 
  as for not looking native french , the truth is that there is no longer a `` native french '' look nowadays , you can fully be black and french , or asian and french . 
  your physical appearence no longer defines your cultural background and identity . 
  my friends in france were all born to french parents and grew up in france , but some looked hispanic , others looked asian , others looked middle eastern , etc. . . 
  he merely pointed out that he will not change and thus he will not start a divide within us that will essentially tear us appart . 
  that is what terrorists want in the end , for us to be terrorised and make very irrational stupid decisions based on that ; if they wanted to truly attack us formally , other ( more efficient ) methods could have been carried out . 
  unfortunately true i feel ... was it like this before ? 
  that 's what happenned when they had one of their walks down my neighbourhood , one of my colleagues ( who got expelled for threatening me ) tried to join and was refused for looking very much middle eastern/north african .
