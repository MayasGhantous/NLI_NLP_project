  its people , however , show a different story as their voting tendencies have not been * that * concise and homogenous to begin with . 
  brilliant show , i wan na rewatch it soonish . 
  yes , though i am pretty sure that does n't deviate from my point : all countries have guilt to them . 
  i could have also mentioned portugal 's human rights violations during salazar ( a far more recent example ) as well as franco 's . 
  do you understand that it is * very * easy for the netherlands to deal with a few extra meters on dams and dykes ? 
  most of them are already very much prepared for such an event . 
   i can think of a few cases of germany being stupid or careless when it comes to large events or cases like these . 
  the most notable for me is the munich olympics terror attacks , where german media broadcasted the exact positions of german anti-terror police as they were about to breach . 
  the terrorists saw it all on the tv . 
  let 's censor medias then , make it explicit what they can and can not say nor broadcast , it * never worked against us in the past , right ? 
  * this was the fault of the broadcasting medias for breaking an unspoken contract with authorities for ratings . 
  this also applies , ironically , to multiple * foreign * medias present over there ( such as the bbc ) . 
   then , at the airport , the germans employed regular policemen , some who had never shot a gun , to use the sniper rifles and take out the terrorists . 
  take a look at gsg 9 's successes and remind us how * awful * they are . 
   this case of german-governmental incompetance led to the deaths of a lot of people . 
  then israel was the one who used brutal efficiency to exact revenge . 
  pot , meet kettle . 
  every government is to blame for something . 
  the dutch government was horrid to indonesia , the british one was a butcher as well , germany was * literally nazi * , portugal persecuted dissidence , spain did too , france fucked up algeria , etc. . . 
  it is easy to criticize , but it is far harder to be exemplary . 
  i compared my generation with that of my parents , and i * think * that perhaps there is a lesser emphasis on alcohol for my generation , it 's no longer seen as the cool rebel amazing thing , and thus now is just a drink you can enjoy at parties , so consumption goes down . 
  i have no clue how true this is though , maybe i 'm entirely wrong . 
  does someone care to explain to me what the hell happened to russia in 2003 ? 
  i mean , calm down russia . 
  i 'm pretty uninformed about the whole macedonia vs greece naming dispute . 
  anyone care to fill me in on both sides of the argument ? 
  ** will the real slim shady please stand up **, 
  are you telling me it was never the ** will ** of the ** people ** ??? 
  she 's an ** undemocratic eurocrat ** who is trying to ** steal our brexit ** and take ** our country away from us ** / s, 
  salty dane has entered the arena . 
  well , for me a healthier refugee response for the eu is to share the load aptly throughout all member states as well as reduce fear and hostility towards refugees by focusing on the key issues ( economic migrants , terrorism threat , etc. . . ) and thus this can be considered disheartening as it * generates * added tensions that put a stop to the overall process to achieve this . 
  yes but let 's be clear about a serious change in eu policy : asylum seekers and already admitted refugees must * not * have residency rights nor working rights outside the member state that is dealing with them . 
  lithuania , slovenia , portugal alike all have seen a really disheartening tendency of refugees getting through the process in their countries and staying , but after a while seeking to migrate to france , germany , or sweden . 
  this is part of the problem and it needs to be stopped . 
  i 'd be super happy to see them come back , though i would n't say they are * needed * , just very much wanted and welcome . 
  aaaah , yes , makes sense . 
  thanks !, 
  thank hell . 
  i do n't know why that aligns with social-liberalism though , could you explain ? 
  for me i think it 's absolutely great and necessary that there is a dialogue about the eu ; but a goddamn nexit referendum like it was for britain seems far too general and even toxic . 
  i like d66 for their pragmatism too , and also for their focus on parts of social living . 
  that 's great !, 
  i 'm pretty happy that it 's mainly gone . 
  it was quite a big worry of mine because i * seriously * love the dutch system as it is , and although i loved most of d66 's programme , i merely was a bit scared of that particularly . 
  i have n't really heard if they dropped it or not , but i agree with nearly all other programme points . 
  if that part is seriously away from what they want to do then i think i 'd vote for them . 
  i * want * to vote for d66 next elections ( when i 'll likely be a dutch citizen and i 'll be able to vote ) but i disagree with their proposed reforms . 
  i do n't like at all what they have in mind for reforms concerning the democratic representation in the netherlands , they want to adopt something more like an american system , and i find that the * current * system ( though it has problems ) is waaay better than that . 
  i 'm pretty unsure on who to vote for because of that . 
  i googled it , and i entirely forgot about it , but this reminded me . 
  what usually happens is that they come back near instantly under a new username . 
  i already disliked orban quite a lot for his bullshit , but how it 's ** personal **, 
  ** what 's that about david cameron ? 
  what happened ? 
  ... wait what ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  what 's that ? 
  oh sorry , i thought i heard an oppressed russian minority . 
  nevermind !, 
  * but will you fuck a pig ? 
  * ( please someone get this reference ), 
  well , i knew this thread would shed some sparks , that 's * precisely * why i clicked on it . 
  i wanted to see the ridiculousness ensuing from either side ( that one englishman you mentioned is winning like charlie sheen at it ), 
  ... ** oooooooh ** i get it , it costed her * an arm and a leg !, 
  oh , i know he 's not the magnificent savior some believe . 
  it was just a reference to [ reagan 's speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-blmoyliiw ), 
  *** mr gorbachev ***, 
  what about the term `` ground floor '' , which is written on most lifts i 've been in ? 
  it 's the ground floor , followed by the first floor , the second one , etc. . . and on the other way it 's minus one , minus two , etc. . . 
  thus fully having a [ base ] + [ floor you want to locate ] structure . 
  mathematically we never just skip 0 and go from 1 to -1 and vice versa , otherwise we are using entirely different units for counting . 
  we have the ground , and then we have * extra * ones , that 's how i see it at least . 
  or we can follow unit values without jumping from -1 to 1 and have a rez de chauss\u00e9e , plus additional floors . 
  mathematically it makes sense because its location will always be rez de chauss\u00e9e + [ floor ] . 
  this works perfectly for positive and negative numbers . 
  well , there * are * some foreigners living in there through many ways . 
  interestingly there are 3 american refugees that ran to the north during the war , and still live over there . 
  it goes from 1 to -1 . 
  * what ? 
  i did n't even know you did , actually . 
  there probably is a rational explanation behind it but eh , i ca n't be arsed . 
  i felt far more cheated when i found out that the us counts its floors on buildings and does n't start at 0 ... * how does that even work ? 
   people assume that brexit is a strict progression towards leaving the eu but actually from theresa may 's point of view it 's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly limey whiny ... stuff . 
  2017 , the doctor . 
   he 's a lot like the idiotic americans who get made fun of on / r/shitamericanssay true , there 's a r/shiteuropeanssay too for a reason, 
  entr\u00e9e is french for entrance , so it 's supposed to be the `` entrance '' dish , aka the appetizer to get you really in that mood you need to be before you 're mind blown by fine cuisine . 
   of which he usually eats 3 packs as lunch . 
  as an entr\u00e9e, 
  o esplendor de portugal, 
  i 'm not sure i understand your point , you are saying that by saying `` everyone should decide by itself within their own life '' i am moralizing ? 
  even though i am leaving each individual to their own morals within the confinements of their own lives as individuals ? 
  i 'm not really sure what the prolmen is here . 
  honestly . 
  surrogate motherhood is alive and well in europe as i see it , i see quite a lot of women practising it , the difference is they do it * by their own choice * and are not forced to it . 
  as for transsexual individuals , never really heard of an issue of that type surfacing in europe , everyone pretty much admits that biologically they are not the same but should * socially and legally * have the same basis . 
  i have no idea why people think that gender and ethnicity are dead dialogues , especially because here in the netherlands there is an open conversation and the result is always the same : we 're all to be regarded as equal and are free to pursue whatever we want , as long as our freedoms do not overstep those of others . 
  it 's pretty damn basic to me . 
  firstly for arts , i assure you that modernism is n't as big as you 'd think . 
  i walked around art galleries the other day and you still see other art movements still developing fresh new pieces , there even was this beautiful marble statue of electra , so it still goes way back . 
  secondly , for architecture , again , walk around amsterdam centrum and tell me that 's true .
