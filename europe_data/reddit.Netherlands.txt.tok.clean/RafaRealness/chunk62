  ** begin !, 
  not at all ^ ( just until we look for a reason / s ), 
  european law actually * is * supreme in every eu member . 
  it 's called the principle of primacy ( or supremacy , both titles are acceptable ) . 
  it was so even before 2005 ( there are cases dating back to the 70s that demonstrate it ) . 
  ... actually have n't thought of that !, 
  problem solved !, 
  ** new eu anthem ladies and gentlemen **, 
  yeah but give wallonia to france . 
  i actually tried but it does n't sound as catchy . 
  thatcher has 2 main syllables tha-tcher , le pen does too , but theresa is the-re-sa so it does n't fit unfortunately . 
  watch out little one or our great little benelux might become just bene, 
  reminds me of this `` friend '' of mine who was overjoyed that geert wilders won ... 
  he gave me a lenghty discourse on how i was wrong about everything in the netherlands and how now with a nexit we were gon na be much better . 
  he was * far * less talky when i explained to him a little something called * reality *, 
  reminds me of one of my favorite songs : miss maggie . 
  renaud literally calls thatcher a nazi , hooligan , etc. . . in a lovesong saying `` no woman would ever be so cruel and so mean ... except thatcher '' that 's the whole song , and it 's pretty damn catchy . 
  replace thatcher by le pen and you pretty much got the 2017 election version too . 
  yeah the soviets were dicks and did n't really like `` socialism with a human face '' reforms, 
  hush , germans do n't get humor . 
  ** yes ** * also that picture of him ... goddamn ... 
  i 'm swoo 'd *, 
  you used to be hungarian ? 
  * \u00a1 escandalo !, 
  does n't he look like that one dude from that one anim\u00e9 ? 
  the really beefed up guy in a uniform ? 
  i do n't know much about anim\u00e9 but he definitely looks like a character i swear . 
  [ genuinely had to google if new ireland is a thing , it is .

  richer part of czechoslovakia sexy sexy language ( very close to slovak too ) velvet revolution was ** lit ** ( gingling keys and shit ) got entirely screwed over in ww2 went through the prague spring under dubcek split from slovakia in the 90s after communism crashed down without any referendum do n't like being called eastern europeans , they prefer the term * central * part of the v4 ** best anthem evar **, 
  this better be a signal to overthrow the bourgeoisie otherwise i 'm gon na be disappointed *** / s ***, 
  this is something that made me laugh far more than i should probably have . 
  *** hy\u00fc\u00fcge ***, 
  ... but ... but where 's the president 's dog ? 
  i think he meant on opinion polls * after * dissolution . 
  like `` yeah czechoslovakia is over , we 're on our own now , maybe that was n't a great idea '', 
  radical muslims , radical atheists , radical other christians ... de gaulle was hated by * faaar * more than just muslims , so it 's not at all far-fetched this is another manifestation of any of the other groups who also hated the guy ( heard that hardline anarchists , communists , and fascists do * specifically * this type of crap in france and elsewhere , so ... ), 
  betreten, 
  ** her\u00d3is do mar **, 
  * good *, 
  someone called me ? 
  i am * not * a native in the netherlands and i agree with that in part . 
  i think that immigration from groups that have been proven to integrate far less than others should be limited , and i also think that more should be done in order to * push * immigrants towards integration ( especially to break up the core centres of foreign groups that form and then become isolated from dutch society ), 
  who would be `` we '' in this case ? 
  basically the eu and turkey have a to-do list with deadlines . 
  that 's all we know , literally , it could be about making sure that turkish lamps are properly labeled in terms of voltage or anything really . 
  [ ** finally this is relevant and accurate yessss ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqvq6buwa8e ), 
  i do n't care , 
  `` why did the chicken cross the road ? '', 
  `` to get to the other side '' make a point on that too . 
  y. . . you did n't get the joke , did you ? 
  he was mocking ukip , who said very similar shit about immigrants in the uk , that 's the joke . 
  why ? 
  firstly what i suggest already existed previously in my country , and to an extent still exists today . 
  it serves as a very strong deterrent to any non-eu migration . 
  secondly , i 'm alleviated that you do n't want to remove them but do you seriously think that * breeding * has shit to do with it ? 
  are we * born * a certain way ? 
  or are we * educated * a certain way ? 
  by raising the importance of values and civic insistence in schools ( beyond the sad excuse we have nowadays ) a lot could already be ameliorated . 
  i know a * lot * of people from mena regions , and the truth is that the migration process is already very strict and keeps on getting stricter , however there * is * an easy way in and that is through family . 
  this for me is the primordial error : do * not * let couples migrate just because they got married ( other means of immigration should remain open though ) . 
  you are talking about large minorities forming as if there are n't already others who form the same way but * integrate * just fine . 
  the problem is closed groups themselves who do not . 
  no foreign culture should form groups and i believe that non-eu/efta citizens should not have the right to work nor live nor study on states they did not immigrate to . 
  i want that * both * extremes are taken into account , because both already spat on my face personally . 
  your solution says `` immigrants from mena are the problem ! '', 
  whereas i say that the problem is not * just * immigration which does not integrate but actual * lack * of pushes towards them . 
  i moved to 4 different eu countries and i 've seen tonnes of bullshit decisions and workings in france , portugal , the netherlands , germany , etc. . . that cause foreigners ( no matter where they are from ) * not * to want to integrate properly , and sometimes even generating vicious cycles of constant antagonization and pushing * away * from integration . 
  my decision is to focus on a filtration system applicable to anyone . 
  if you uphold ideals such as shariah law or a ban on women 's rights or criminalization of homosexuality , etc. . . then you should face proper measures to either allow you to accept values you do not , or neutralized in order to not be a potential danger . 
  if we want to * have * european values , then we must start following them ourselves , and also be harsher on those who push against them . 
  furthermore your argument about mena regions being more likely to go against them , that is perhaps true , however i still believe that if we start discriminating against them actively we will generate more issues than we will solve , so i believe that * anyone * native or foreigner , european or mena , * must * face the same integrative factors when it comes to these values . 
  i 'm not even dutch , i 'm originally portuguese , and for me * at first * it felt like french people are just creepily smiling , all the time , every time , at everything . 
  but you do get used to it very quickly if you actively try your best to integrate . 
  exactly , that is why i care when we still have these differences between east and west ( and sometimes we still have comparable problems in parts of the west even ) . 
  i am very happy that slowly but surely eastern europe is becoming more progressive , but there is no denial that there still are problems over there . 
  plus , i am also happy that 2nd generation immigrants are far better integrated , though i think that we should have a better way to make sure that * anyone * needs to follow the same norms and values , and i am sure that through progress in these areas we can . 
  this proves a clear dissonance on what is accepted and unaccepted within europe itself , thus the `` european values '' tend to very much be those upheld in ( most of ) the west . 
  not to mention that not * every single european * has the same values , as proven by regions both east and west that are still , for example , sexist or racist . 
  i care about being harassed by * anyone * regardless of mena or european ... 
  i want you to understand that some values are * not * shared by all europeans yet and thus we still have problems at times . 
  you have not answered my question in the least plus . 
  we need to be equipped to deal with any type of population that does not follow predefined and accepted values ( mind you , including natives as well ) . 
  i give 0 shits of nationality i care about respect and proper following of the societal norms and values in place . 
  except when we do n't . 
  i got attacked for being gay in france and portugal , once by a polish guy , the second time by a romanian couple of assholes . 
  where 's the cultural sensitivity on that , considering it 's fine to be gay on both ? 
  not everything is acceptable in every country , there are clear differences that need to be accounted for . 
  in a lot of cases that get ignored , even between european countries , this is not the case . 
  what are these `` european values '' you keep talking about ? 
  because there is a huge obsession about them yet there is no definition because nobody agrees on them , so we * are * different , just close and united . 
  ... that is utter crap to be fully honest . 
  i am a european who moved around a lot and trust me when i say that if you move abroad there is a lot of integration that goes into it , even beyond language . 
  the same social norms are not the same , the same language ( which * is * a big chunk of culture even if you want to pretend it is n't ) , the same culinary methods , not even the same juridical and public proceedings or politeness forms . 
  i came off as rude as fuck in france when i first was there because i did n't smile as much as them , so i made adjustments and obviously i learned french and embraced french culture and customs ; why ? 
  because i love france and wanted to be a part of french society . 
  meanwhile in spain there are tonnes of britons who do n't know crap about spanish history or culture , who do n't speak a word of spanish , and who ignore social norms that the spanish people have but the brits do not . 
  they are closer culturally than a chinese person , but integration is always needed , and if you refuse to integrate , you are no better than a * minority who will not integrate * . 
  everyone * who integrates * is welcome .
