  uk is a global financial centre for many reasons , but eu is not really relevant here . 
  i study economic and law of europe , the uk can not continue a * lot * of its processes ( especially the biggest ones related to europe and the us ) legally should the arrangement may proposes be actually done , not to mention the other several infractions that you keep ignoring in my comments that are both eu related as well as non-eu related ( like a complete u-turn on the * primordial articles * of the good friday agreement ) . 
   democracy is not just institutions ( though they matter ) it is also about common sense of identity ( which does not exist in the eu ) . 
  again , why is it that the uk voted to stay before , and also why is it that the uk is n't exactly the shining beacon of democracy ? 
  furthermore , what would you like to say to other , democratic countries with multiple identities , such as spain , germany , the netherlands , belgium , and even romania ? 
   yes , but the difficulty here is that in the uk our constitution is such that one parliament can not bind another . 
  we can always change our mind . 
  we decided that we wanted competences returned from brussels and it turned out this was impossible with the way the eu works . 
  so basically instead of stating this and making brexit a non-inflammatory cause , your government opted out for scapegoating multiple eu countries , the eu itself , theresa even made a mockery of herself at an official dinner * and * at the last european council meeting ( she 's a meme in erasmus and my university now ) , not to mention bojo 's trip to italy , and even david davis forgetting that ireland declared independence ... 
  brilliant eh ? 
   you clearly do n't want the uk to succeed . 
  however , i love your country and would be delighted for you to succeed . 
  ... you do not know where i am from and you do not represent your government nor does this change * anything * of what i have said as it is based on law and logic . 
  i am half portuguese and half french , in 2007 the uk basically shat on my country 's good will and even broke international law with the mccain case , it also made severe critical comments about france and its management of the calais even though france * specifically lets the uk control the border over there * so again , more scapegoating . 
  i care for the countries in this union to succeed first , anything else comes second to me . 
  the uk , though i wish it well , is n't really a priority since i care more about countries that * are n't * toxic on occasion to my own . 
   high economic growth , peace , low unemployment . 
  we have those in the eu . 
  plus good luck with fixing any issues with a tumbling circus government who generates r/nottheonion type events more often than anyone in the eu ( it 's as if it 's in competition with the us at times ), 
  no idea what he meant , all the treaties relating to membership obligations is basically `` once you meet requirements you got ta join ! '', 
  but you ca n't really just meet requirements on accident to be honest , so basically sweden , poland , etc. . . will just join whenever they feel like it . 
  quelle surprise . 
   the uk and ireland are going to maintain the common travel area . 
  * you are n't in schengen what borders are you talking about then ? 
  the border with spain ? 
  *  uk is going to allow irish citizens all the rights in the uk that they currently have . 
  but why would the eu ever grant the citizens of a country that does not contribute to the eu any citizenship ? 
  irish citizenship comes with the right of full access to * all * of the internal market as well as being protected through the echr . 
  british citizenship , without eu/eea citizenship , does not . 
   northern ireland is still peaceful . 
  yet already voted for a non-unionist party for the same time , as well as constantly calling for answers regarding clarification on the good friday agreements ( that * can not * be followed because of the uk ) as well as very sadistic questions over market dependance on roi and access to that market . 
   hopefully the rest of the eu will accept that a free trade deal is necessary . 
  but if the eu does not want a free trade deal , then blame them , not the uk . 
  the uk is clear it wants one . 
  it is not at all necessary for the eu to have an fta with the uk , plus it requires a unanimous agreement of all member states , and portugal , spain , france , and the netherlands already stated that they * will not * accept at all a brexit deal if the tax haven and smuggling central that is gibraltar is not dealt with properly . 
  not to mention , the uk already is slyly trying to get away from * multiple * obligations it signed and ratified and agreed to from 1973 to 2009 . 
  so again , the uk is trying to basically get what ? 
  it is not successful for the eu to grant the uk an fta considering how the uk has a huge tax haven right there in the mediterranean , plus you have yet to evoke financial markets ( for the third time ) who do * not * depend on any fta they depend on passporting rights which require assimilation to the internal market ( or any market of the uk 's choosing ) thus decimating london 's economy . 
  what does the uk win with an fta ? 
  being treated like other countries , like south korea ... 
  impressive . 
   no , the uk wants global free trade . 
  it is possible to have free trade with both the us and the eu . 
  so the uk will gravely degrade its status as a trading hub , which is a considerable portion of its gdp , it also is destroying its financial passporting rights with all of europe and adjacent territories , thus basically setting the city 's economy on fire ...  we do n't want to be part of the single market , thanks . 
  you did for years , and even had a referendum in 1975 remember ? 
  the real problem is you merely had your country scapegoating the eu for years , simultaneously wanting to be a part of it to fully be against further progresses in integration and also far away to ask for more opt-outs and exempts and special treatments than * anyone in it * . 
  but if it is your wish to isolate yourselves , go back to what made the 70s such troubling times economically , especially in an increasingly volatile world , be my guest . 
   uk will be able to have ftas with those countries too . 
  i severely doubt the uk will ever be able to strike the same deals the eu did , especially considering that compared to the internal market , the uk is * very * small and dedicated production would be far less profitable to a tiny country like the uk compared to * a whole continent that redistributes heavily into the rest of eurasia * . 
  you have yet to address financial markets , again . 
  which are a * very * important part of the british economy ( debatably the backbone of it , especially as seen as the inequality between london and the rest of the uk ) . 
   we no longer outsource bits of our democracy to a body that does not function democratically . 
  you directly elect the european council ( national leaders ) and also the european parliament , your government appoints both the commission and the council of ministers ( literally our own ministers ) . 
  so if the eu is undemocratic , how is the uk , a country with one of the least democratic systems in the eu , any better ? 
  not to mention that the eu can not force the uk to concede any competences , so if the uk disagreed with it in the past then it could literally just have said `` no '' . 
  expansion of the eu requires * full * compliance of all concerned member states and the uk said `` yes !, 
  yes !, 
  yes ! '', 
  since 1973 until the euro which , like denmark , it was n't ever forced to join . 
   this is fantastic for both the eu and the uk . 
  hopefully you will join me in making brexit a success !, 
  you get to be in the eu ( which you want ) and we get to be out of the eu ( which we want ) . 
  this works for everyone . 
  you have yet to say why the eu would want the uk to succeed , or * how * both can succeed . 
  what exactly do you consider a bilateral success ? 
   i am talking about single market regulation , which has qualified majority voting . 
  ... yes , and that also comes through the same basic procedure , furthermore it still needs to pass the council of ministers as well as the parliament so are you saying that the ministers and voters of europe are wrong and that the uk is n't even though the standards before joining already were * veeery * much the same to the trading block ? 
   uk is very committed to maintaining free trade with ireland . 
  yet you want your borders back , and you can not maintain equality among irish and uk citizens because uk citizens will no longer be eu citizens , as well as the fact that importations on free trade especially for dairy produces in either side of ireland will closely need inspection . 
  great job , you threw years of peacemaking processes and developments into the backburner , and * everyone * is still waiting for a proposal for ireland . 
  also , spoiler alert : you can not have free trade with ireland without having free trade with * all * of the eu , which needs to be approved by all eu members . 
   the eu is n't the biggest market in the world any more . 
  the us is a bigger market . 
  us : 26.69 % of the world ( 43,021,279 ) ** eu countries only ( no efta ) ** germany :4.85 % ( 2,086,559 million usd ) france :3.61 % ( 1,553,253 million usd ) italy :3.02 % ( 1,300,337 million usd ) spain : 1.88 % ( 810,339 million usd ) netherlands : 0.89 % ( 384,478 million usd ) poland : 0.74 % ( 320,196 million usd ) belgium : 0.63 % ( 270,819 million usd ) sweden : 0.63 % ( 270,762 million usd ) austria : 0.54 % ( 230,783 million usd ) greece : 0.40 % ( 172,484 million usd ) denmark : 0.38 % ( 164,352 million usd ) finland : 0.34 % ( 147,440 million usd ) portugal : 0.34 % ( 146,970 million usd ) ireland : 0.34 % ( 112,466 million usd ) romania : 0.2915 % ( 101,103 million usd ) czechia : 0.2778 % ( 96,360 million usd ) bulgaria : 0.1981 % ( 68,704 million usd ) slovenia : 0.1592 % ( 55,233 million usd ) croatia : 0.1035 % ( 35,889 million usd ) hungary : 0.0928 % ( 32,180 million usd ) slovakia : 0.0785 % ( 27,238 million usd ) lithuania : 0.0731 % ( 25,363 million usd ) luxembourg : 0.0519 % ( 17,998 million usd ) latvia : 0.0459 % ( 15,930 million usd ) estonia : 0.0288 % ( 9,995 million usd ) malta : 0.0145 % ( 5,051 million usd ) eu ( sans efta ) : 20.0056 % ( approx . 
  8,606,664.99 millions usd ) ** efta additions ** switzerland : 0.85 % ( 365,453 million usd ) norway : 0.49 % ( 210,143 million usd ) iceland : 0.0178 % ( 6,190 million usd ) liechtenstein : 0.0081 % ( 2,799 million usd ) efta total : 1.3659 % ( approx . 
  584,585 million usd ) eu+efta total ( aka the internal market ) : 21.3715 % ( approx . 
  9191249.99 million usd ) so the uk basically wanted to go for the us , who has more blockades and more protectionist measures towards third-degree entities ( as the uk is for the us and will be for the eu ) , for roughly a 5.3185 % * potential * increase ( even though there is absolutely no legal nor economic way to make the uk access all of the us market , because * to fully have access to a market it requires assimilation * so the uk may gain even less access ) . 
  you had unconditional access , including labor and capital ( which considering the standards and practices discrepancies between the us and the uk you will not get ) to about a fifth of the world 's market , not to mention all the ftas that were adjacent to it as well as autonomous non-sovereign territories . 
  you traded it for an fta with the us , which does not even grant * any * european citizen education equivalence in their country , and whose fiscal system is entirely incompatible with the uk 's . 
  again , what did the uk gain ? 
   no , this is not the case . 
  single market regulation is by qualified majority voting . 
  not the agenda , which is done by the european council , which is * literally our national leaders and nothing passes without everyone being onboard * . 
   a majority of scottish voters are about to vote for parties who are against there being another referendum . 
  and the irish ? 
  and what about their industries ? 
  and what about * the uk 's financial markets * who are about to lose access to the biggest market in the world ? 
  lots of questions you have yet to answer . 
   uk will be in charge of its own regulatory framework , this is a success . 
  wow , what a `` success '' . 
  too bad you already were and literally had the power to veto any decisions you did n't like ... 
  so the uk really did n't do anything for itself that it did n't already have . 
   scottish independence is now less likely than before the eu referendum , yet there are already talks of a 2nd referendum and ireland is thrown into turnmoil as is gibraltar . 
  good going . 
  sorry , as per directive 1973/23/lol we * must * keep posting this until the uk actually leaves the eu . 
  barbara streisand *, 
  ** i 'm happy to see my country win , especially in its own language , but * fucking hell * salvador had an attitude problem . 
  \u00c0 vitoria, 
   is it normal that administrations complain ? 
  surprisingly yes , just look at the list of complaints this show got by sarkozy .
