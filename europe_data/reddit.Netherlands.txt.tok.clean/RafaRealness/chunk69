  i am saying that the lgbt help groups are not at all supporting them in the least since there is absolutely no registry in these cases on who has contacted them for protection . 
  thus your point on `` oh now everyone knows they are gay ! '', 
  is entirely wrong . 
  i got helped by a similar association and there is never any record you have ever contacted them , plus if you storm an ngo like the rainbow railroad ( one of the helping lgbt networks ) then you will start shit up with the us and canada concerning the safety of their citizens . 
   turkey . 
  so the more turks want to go to greece ... i tried hard not to laugh , i really did , but ... god fucking damnit . 
   lets leave hungary isolated with their v4 ( poland ) mates and see how it works out for them . 
  right now we have poland and hungary making shit difficult , that 's true , but remind yourself that czechia and slovakia have n't . 
  punishing individual member states carefully to balance between actual meaningful punishment , and not far enough to cause a disdain for the eu by the citizens themselves ( who are not to be punished , but the government itself ) . 
  gay or not they do not deserve such a horrid treatment . 
   lgbt networks standing up for `` gays '' in chechnya gives the authorities an opportunity to say that those people really are gay , even the lgbt groups are supporting them !, 
  not like there is a registry of who 's in there ya know ? 
  and good luck getting away with suddenly starting this shit on american or canadian citizens like the ones in the rainbow railroad . 
  made me laugh far too hard, 
  * fight me *, 
  * beyonc\u00e9 fits more nicely . 
   i do n't think the great patriot and heroine would accept foreign domination of france and a removal of the sovereignty of france that the eu represents . 
  also someone hiding behind immunity laws while casually stealing away with thousands of euros , known for wanting to revoke rights the french have fought for , plagiarizing speeches * in their whole and complete entirety * , someone whose mom posed for playboy in the 70s and whose dad ( who created the party itself ) continuously makes holocaust denial remarks , and even xenophobic unbased claims , not to mention she belongs to a party that at the fall of a french policeman embarrassed themselves as they fully milked the situation and mourned him ... until his * husband * came along . 
  she lost for a plethora of reasons , she also lost * fairly * through the democratic elections process of france , so she is no joan of arc , she is a political candidate who lost an election . 
  the french did not see her in the least like you portray her , and the french themselves elected a pro-eu candidate . 
  una in diversitate,

  [ why of course !, 
  ** ** suck it finland !, 
  netherlands reigns supreeeeeeme !, 
  ** nice and all but no netherlands ? 
  seriously ? 
  again i think you 're misunderstanding me . 
  let 's take an example of two countries called aland and beland , they both sign an international agreement for free travel of their citizens . 
  the agreement itself thus generates provisions that guarantee two conditions : direct effect and primacy for both . 
  the laws in the treaties thus under go one of two projects : direct application * without the need of any transposition * and as such directly trumping national law , or * application via transposition * which does require national law to follow it , however , here 's the important part : the application of the transposition is not debatable as per agreements and deadlines are given , and if there is a case where aland or beland do n't actually transpose , then there will nearly always be additional provisions and negotiations ( potentially even suspensions ) attributed to this . 
  a good example of this can be seen in the eu , where there was a directive ( which * do * require transposition ) that the uk entirely did not implement and argued that because it failed to transpose then it is of no effect . 
  yet the european court of justice concluded otherwise in the case of the uk ( i ca n't remember the year , but i 'll try to ) , stating that the * condition and obligation * of the british government was unconditional as per the treaty of the functioning of the european union . 
  this thus shows that if you go by a monist approach ( international law  national law no transposition needed ) or a dualist approach ( international law must be integrated into national law first ) , if you agreed to anything you * will * be held accountable should you fail to meet the standard practice . 
  so by ratification you are guaranteeing that the international law enters into effect , this is a ridiculously common provision to the point it 's essentially the copypasta of treaties nowadays . 
  i think you misunderstood what i said : i said that as long as you recognize the validity of the provisions in place then you also are accepting that your courts must accept international law as actual law for both private and public institutions * even if transposition is not needed , or required but incomplete * ( look at the van gend en loos case [ here ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a61962cj0026 ) ) . 
  international law * does * apply to a country by its government , then national law is directly subordinated by it . 
  the principles of direct effect and of primacy are essential for the functioning of international agreements and law , otherwise it becomes unusable . 
  i * do * agree with you that should the government ( and most especially the courts ) in question not recognize the validity of these provisions then it merely becomes a paper with a doodle on it . 
  although for most international agreements there are mechanisms and further provisions in place for a clean end to them ( * usually * , there are some exceptions ), 
  ... no , they really do not , that 's only the case when transposition of said laws and agreements is needed , and * even then * should the concerned parties fail to transpose the adequate laws and agreements , then they will be held responsible by it and international law takes over the competent rights . 
  if what you said was true then there would be * no * international agreements in the world , like , at all . 
  it would literally be impossible to have international agreements if national law would be the end-all-be-all of law . 
  a e s t h e t i c s. 
  just as grimly , portugal 's corporatist authoritarian regime ( estado novo ) went from 1933 to 1974 , spain was under franco from 1936 to 1975 , only in 1971 could swiss women vote on federal elections ( with the exception of appenzell innerrhoden that only did so in 1991 ) ... 
  the list goes on and on , and i think it 's important and also interesting to remember just how * recent * some really alien sights were . 
  the ussr alone is entirely foreign to me ( i was born after it collapsed ) yet in reality it 's only been about 26 years . 
  yep , exactly . 
  if the uk would say `` we will refuse any deal unless ireland stops being a tax haven '' the uk is not at all demanding ireland to go back to being part of the uk again , just like spain is n't doing so here for gibraltar . 
  it 's still a disputed area , and if you read up on it the * legal * documentation of the area , you can see that portugal still has control over some administrative and juridical decisions that take place in there . 
  if you go to oliven\u00e7a / olivenza you wo n't see a border sign because neither side agrees where it should be and basically kept taking each other 's signs for a couple of years . 
  in the case of administrative affairs all inhabitants of oliven\u00e7a / olivenza can actually choose to follow portuguese or spanish schooling administration for example . 
  competences have been shared though the claim is still active . 
  nobody in neither side really cares about who oliven\u00e7a / olivenza belongs to , as long as it remains under control and obeys the available and competent jurisdiction ( for court procedures and civic administration mainly spanish , for healthcare , education , and other social services it 's hybrid ) . 
  gibraltar is a good case of how territorial claims are pretty much a dick-measuring contest at times since i 've yet to meet a spaniard who actually wants gibraltar back ( * it 's a rock * ) , what spain wants to certify is that it does not have to withstand the constant abuse of law and tax evasion that the small rock has been generating , especially for a country outside the eu . 
  it also has an `` active '' claim over oliven\u00e7a / olivenza and it 's not an issue . 
  furthermore , if you paid attention to the spanish position on uk-eu negotiations , it 's clear : they do n't really want gibraltar back but will not admit it to still be a tax haven and a source of unfair competition and even multiple accounts of smuggling . 
  that is * literally * what they 've been saying . 
  ... this is not a territorial claim though , spain does n't want gibraltar back , it merely does n't want to have a tax haven at its doors . 
  if the uk did the same to ireland , would the uk be reclaiming ireland as part of itself ? 
   we did , we fought a world war no idea what this `` we '' means lest you 're speaking french , mate . 
  well when it comes to jerking at least one hand is a bit occupied ... 
  i share the same concerns , mainly because it somewhat seems like we 'd have no real point to study or progress , as robots do everything for us , and how would we ourselves become billionaires and have our own robots ? 
  i do n't know if i 'd bode well under that system . 
  so you did n't do anything but want a `` thanks '' ? 
  ok , cool . 
  actually a good analogy , * stealin ' it !, 
   melania trump plagiarizes michelle obama i 'd be sooo disappointed if this was n't on the list . 
   streisand 's law strikes again . 
  [ ** oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp-ytddyrni ), 
  and where is this ? 
  because thus far i have never heard this complaint from any of my italian friends , or anyone i know who 's italian . 
  jokes ? 
  well yeah , even i get a cheeky banter joke here n there but not at all to that level . 
  and who said berlusconi was anything but himself ? 
  i sure as fuck am not rutte ( i wish ), 
  though i agree that a federation is for the best , i do n't think it 's at all the best option . 
  instead we need to do what we 've always done , focus on the cooperation needed to solve the issue ( s ) we are facing and fix them * together * , step by step . 
   prove it is directly `` brussels ' fault '' who would be the jury of this proof ? 
  it would need to be someone neutral . 
  good bants lad !, 
  we still love you brit fellas . 
  soo may = the entirety of the united kingdom & its citizens ? 
  i think you need to chill and know when to distinguish humorous banter from the rest . 
  yes . 
  compared to boris , she 's also got the looks out of the two . 
   i 'd vote for him in a heartbeat over may or corbyn says something about may and corbyn imho, 
  well , i do n't really see any groups preaching for constant terrorism in the uk for an independent ireland , but i * do * see groups preaching for the return of fascism . 
  there is still a huge difference imo, 
   do we have an equivalent of tiocfaidh ar l\u00e1 that the british do n't scream `` terrorist '' over ? 
  i mean , why not use it regardless of what the brits call it ? 
  the ira has n't been bombing shit for quiiiiite a long time now , different times . 
  truth be told , they are definitely a big favorite . 
  genuinely shocked this did n't win . 
  can we all just start sending the funniest and most unusual singers instead ? 
  the `` good '' singers of eurovision tend to be really damn boring and generic , just the same old love songs or whatever . 
  meanwhile finland won with literally demons on fucking stage preachin ' hard rock , ireland sent out dustin , austria gave us the wurst experience , etc. . . 
  * no fucking way nobody in this comment has made this reference about him : * ** we could have had it aaaaaalll ** ** rollin ' in the deeeeeeeep **, 
  that 's true , as the french taught me : l'exception fait la r\u00e8gle !, 
  we have a rug * specifically * so your soles are clean before you enter the house , french people have it too .
