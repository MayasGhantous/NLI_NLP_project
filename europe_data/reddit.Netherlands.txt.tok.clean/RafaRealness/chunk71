  the answer is `` they did , did you ? '', 
  you kindly left out the * first sentence * of my previous comment . 
  yesterday i saw this speech of le pen complaining about leftist groups `` being unpunished by the state '' and the first thing i could think of was '' * you * out of all people wan na start this ? '', 
  i also remember that picture of her at 6 years old , getting tucked in bed with an fn `` defeat the marxist cancer ! '', 
  poster on her bedroom wall . 
  and yet they do n't teach much about any of that , it 's just glossed over . 
  not to mention the crude way the us teaches about the cold war to its own kids where everyone who 's a commie = inherently evil . 
  take a look at an american history book and most of the time there is * no * mention how they supported the south african regime during apardheid , nor yugoslavia , ceaucescu 's romania , etc. . . 
  yet you can argue `` but those are foreign , not domestic , so it 's normal it 's not taught as extensively '' but what about the fact that nearly every american i meet seems to entirely forget that * they too * had concentration camps for the japanese ? 
  or not knowing they basically * funded * what later became al qaeda itself ? 
  meanwhile in czechia ( after the 70s and 80s ) , the lety concentration camp is pretty known and even politically debated because of the privately owned pig farm they built there . 
  why is it so easy to forget history in america , and equally as easy to lecture on it ? 
  so i find it a bit rich for an american to come to r/europe complain about czechia ( who in my opinion just took a step in the right direction , one the us has n't for example ) to try and lecture about recognizing one 's history . 
   yeah , but have they recognized what they did are the lety concentration camp yet ? 
  ... yes , they have . 
  it was never even brought into question because everyone knows about it . 
  did the us recognize its own support for dictatorships right here in europe ? 
  or even worldwide today ? 
   recognizing somebody else 's historical bullshit is easy . 
  recognizing one 's own is harder . 
  rich . 
  the problem is a user coming for goatt86 with a bullshit victimizing argument . 
  ( though now it 's been removed ), 
  he could just not post these articles * if turkish officials would stop saying shite like claiming other countries territories * . 
  if you believe that greek officials are just as bad , then feel free to post articles about that as well . 
   britain civilised half of the world ; you should thank us . 
  by invading it and colonizing it ? 
   oh , and you 're welcome for all the contributions to humanity . 
  like torture in yemen , or perhaps having a leader against german reunification ? 
  the uk has a lot of blood in its hands just like everyone else , and was not half as humanitarian as you 'd like . 
  also , do you consider portuguese , gibraltarian , maltese , and spanish people to be objectively arabs ? 
  as all these places were historically under islamic control ? 
  same for the ex-ottoman empire in europe . 
  also , i guess that england is german since you are basically just emigrated saxons . 
  easy to hate , is n't it ? 
  ~ from french empire . 
  former parisian here , the moroccans and algerians are n't particularly bad at all . 
  the problem is the ghettos , which as you may guess include far more than just them , and also harbor french-born citizens . 
   the world would he an objectively better place without them . 
  rich coming from a brit . 
  whenever a scotsman does something wrong : he 's scottish . 
  whenever a scotsman does something right : he 's british . 
  i 'd say scotland could easily start doing the same by claiming that anyone doing crap = english , and anyone doing something right = * of celtic descent *, 
  belgium = the netherlands ? 
  1830 happened ya know ... 
  i think there was some sort of anti constitutional problem with czechia last time there was a restrictive directive regarding gun ownership and acquisitions . 
  i really do n't know the details since i have n't read up on it that much , but prague was able to step its foot down for sure . 
  well no . 
  some are made through doggy style , some missionary ... 
  i * lived * in one and , surprise surprise , i 'm alive and well and never really faced a problem . 
  i live in one right now and life 's pretty quiet , the media is merely dramatizing what actually goes on here . 
  problems ? 
  yeah , just like any other place , but i never felt unsafe in the least . 
  perhaps you 're right , it definitely is prime-time for terrorist action in france to ensure le pen gets more favorable votes , though with the constant new security measures in france it 's very difficult ( though not impossible ) . 
  i think that the fear still lingers though , and it 'll be interesting how it will come into play . 
  although i like macron , gon na have to disagree with him on this one . 
  the whole response all of the eu gave to the refugee crisis was pretty damn tragic , and that includes poland , germany , sweden , italy , france , * all * of us . 
  we gave a shit response through and through . 
  i agree with what you 're saying , that if you tell electors that they are no longer needed then you 're gon na get fucked ; but i think you misunderstood what i said . 
  i think that * according to the polls * he stands a very large chance of winning , i was not at all saying that we 're out of the danger of lepen winning for good , just that all things considered it 's unlikely . 
  a lot of people do n't know this , but the word for potato in lithuanian ( bulv\u0117 ) also means `` true love '' . 
   france is currently at war with muslim terrorists . 
  people are getting butchered in the streets of paris almost weekly now . 
  jews are fleeing to israel by the thousands . 
  i can say the same thing about school children in america . 
   this is n't a safe or peaceful time to be french . 
  i 'm french , and i 'm very safe , be it in the netherlands or france . 
  my family ( as you can guess , also french ) is also safe . 
  times where being french was not safe was ww2 and those days are over for good thanks to the eu/eec . 
  why not both ? 
  i have n't found a single poll that accounts for abstention that demonstrated a result less favorable than roughly 60-40 . 
  not entirely sure where you 've got a 60 % abstention figure , as all polls i 've found that * do * account for abstention show that figure limited to 20 % ~ 30 % in the 2nd round . 
  i think his chances of winning are even higher than that , he 's won every single poll against lepen with absolutely no exception thus far , and 2 weeks is a very small time period in which i doubt a lot can happen to deter the vote to a whopping 20 % difference from every single poll . 
  based on the polls i saw so far of the macron vs lepen case it seems that the fn will lose , however its defeat will * not * be the huge crush the fn suffered in 2002 . 
  i personally like macron , and i 'm very happy with the outcome . 
  * heresy . 
  nor am i. latvia and lithuania do n't speak a slavic language , they both speak baltic languages , and estonia speaks a finnic language . 
  ** this is why i do n't watch anime i am not ready for that **, 
  apparently i moved elsewhere in the netherlands . 
  i do not know where i am ... is this that friesland i keep hearing about ? 
  an \u00e9 and an e merely are not pronounced the same what the fuck ? 
  ** g e t r i k k e r d. **, 
  ... that 's not where amsterdam is . 
  ... * what the fuck . 
  came for all the shouting in this thread . 
  surprisingly quiet , i 'll have to come back later . 
  ** do n't let me down i want a proper fight about this goddamnit my popcorn is getting cold **, 
   the uk has provided a total of $ 6.5 bn ( # 5bn ) via the eu for two bailouts : $ 3bn for ireland in november 2010 and $ 3.5 bn for portugal in may 2011 . 
  in addition , in 2010 , the uk provided $ 3.9 bn in bilateral bailout loans to its neighbour and important trading partner - ireland . 
  the uk has made further contributions ... because the imf too provided loans for some of the bailouts . 
  so the uk broke the growth and stability pact ? 
  interesting . 
  also , according to your article the uk was going to be reimbursed , but you left so not anymore , funny . 
  also , the article itself says that the uk has * not * made any contributions via the eu itself , it did them by its own accord . 
  for me i believe that the uk should be reimbursed for its contributions done from its own accord even if it leaves , but it 's hard to defend sending eu funds to a non-eu state when the eu budget has to be approved by all 28 ( 27 ) member states as well as parliament . 
  also , you keep saying * nations * but you mean * states * . 
  people are not politics and the uk did not personally give the portuguese * nation * anything but it has ( although against a very crucial pack ) helped the portuguese * state * . 
   the crisis hit nations have also started to receive more general eu funds . 
  very true , the crisis was a deep cut for everyone , but especially for states overspending constantly ( portugal is a very good example ) . 
  these states ( including my own ) should be punished accordingly in my opinion , the eurozone needs a far better system for budgetary checks and balances to prevent some states from overspending .
