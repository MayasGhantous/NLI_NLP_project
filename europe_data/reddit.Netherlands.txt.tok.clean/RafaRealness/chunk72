   the uk pays into those . 
  so does every single eu state , even the ones who receive the most ( poland ) . 
   for someone who does n't care , you are adamant about distorting the facts and deflecting the issues . 
  well , i actually is studying european policy making , and so far what the eu is doing is * exactly * what would happen , it 's been predicted even before brexit . 
  read up the exit mechanisms as per the treaty of lisbon and you will see that this has always already been on paper a decade before , so i still have yet to get your problem . 
  for someone who 's leaving , the uk sure wants to keep everything . 
  i personally do n't care if the uk leaves or stays , as both outcomes for me seem good/bad , but i love talking about it and it 's a pretty central part of my studies right now ; so obviously i 'm gon na debate over it . 
   uk has followed eu rules but its people want to leave . 
  correct , and until it actually leaves ( 2 years ) it will need to continue to abide by eu rules as they are . 
   the eu is cutting the uk off from benefits early but insists contributions will go far into the future . 
  the eu is cutting the uk from projects the uk will not be a part of in the least . 
  the uk does not , for example , have to do anything for the eurozone itself since it has a full opt-out , and now there is a * de facto * opt-out for the uk for any single thing that will affect the eu for longer than the uk 's stay . 
  should the uk entirely ignore its transitional exit clause responsibilities then the uk will not have to pay a single penny to the eu , however the eu in response can entirely block out the uk . 
  this is an option that can be done by revoking all eu treaties ' validity in the uk and can technically be done in less than a day , however as i 'm sure you 're aware , this is the most destructive option for both sides . 
   the eu is n't a big scary monster ; it is the new european nationalism once again seeing domination as acceptable practice . 
  not sure what you mean by `` once again '' . 
  the rise of nationalism is definitely a thing nowadays yet it 's * national * - ism , however domination is not at all in the tables here ( otherwise do you think there would be a mechanism to leave to begin with ? ) . 
  the eu can not do anything without the consent of its member states and has been known for ( unfortunately in my opinion ) being pretty shit at actively punishing violation of european law as well as having a good ( or sometimes any ) pr . 
  this has been a possible explanation of brexit : the uk ( since the start of the european project itself ) has always regarded itself `` appart '' from the whole thing and only wanted free trade ( which was a huge reason to join the eec ) to begin with , but as the project moves forward ( from the eec to the ec , from the ec into the eu , from the erm into the euro , etc. . . ) . 
  there is a big distinction between intergovernmental elements and supranational elements of the eu ( mainly the commission and the parliament ) that i think may be what you mean by this `` european domination '' claim . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but you believe that the uk is being dominated by the eu based on the functioning of these supranational manifestations , but i think you ignore the role of the european council , and the council of ministers , which ensure that the uk ca n't really be forced to do anything it has not agreed to . 
   if it does not deal fair , there will be a trade war between the eu and its closest trading partner ( ca n't get closer than a member ) and huge damage will be done to both . 
  technically the uk is not the closest trading partner * yet * because the uk has not left * yet * , and even then it 's a bit debatable if the uk will really be * the * closest trading partner because the eu , depending on how you evaluate it , trades more with switzerland , or the us , but still the uk will be a * very * close trading partner nonetheless . 
  once it leaves , the uk can not really be as close as , say , switzerland or norway , because the uk is not willing to respect crucial requirements for being a part of the efta ( not to mention norway 's pm hint at vetoing the uk 's entry into it ) . 
  an fta is the best ( if not the sole ) way to go about this , but it still does not answer questions that will affect citizens themselves . 
  what will be done about the eu/uk citizens that live abroad ? 
  what will be done about the irish question ? 
  what will be done with the calais deals ? 
  all of these questions are still nowhere to be answered by a simple fta . 
  there is ** a lot ** to be discussed and there are deep questions that thus far the uk * and * the eu have yet to address , some of which are pretty scary for some of my closer friends . 
   but only the eu is drunk on hubris . 
  you keep saying `` the eu '' but again , the eu is 28 , soon to be 27 , national governments at work , and the uk has to negotiate with the eu ( all these governments ) at once . 
  the eu by itself has no real opinion on anything they demand/accept/revoke , etc. . . 
  if you judge the eu to be drunk on excessive pride , then what is the uk ? 
  with claims of potential military action of gibraltar , and its constant shouting and blaring at different eu countries , not to mention how `` kind '' the uk was to portugal in 2007 . 
  a great example of this is how may 's speech was received in the last european council meeting she went to in malta ( we * still * laugh about it to this day in my university for a reason ) . 
  i love 'em but the really good ones drain my battery like a vampire, 
  ooooh ~ what kind of games do you make ? 
  that ... no , actually that seems like a pretty cool idea . 
  ** rule britannia **, 
  ... soooo i take it you 're moving here ? 
  i * could * learn some lithuanian , seems like a cool language . 
   you are all over the place . 
  true , i move more often . 
   the eu did not handle the crisis in your country well ( whichever one it is ) portugal has made progress by opposing the austerity pushed by germany and as for the uk doing absolutely nothing we are net contributors to the eu what financial assistance your nation received was part funded by us . 
  the crisis was mishandled , that is true , however the austerity measures proposed by germany ( as well as a lot of other countries like france or belgium or luxembourg , etc. . . ) have been followed extensively , cuts that even affected me directly when i lived there . 
  portugal 's government showed opposition to the whole project but after 2011 it had absolutely no choice but to follow through , and so it did . 
  as for funding , nothing concerning monetary policy stability came from the uk 's funds because the uk is not at all part of the eurozone or even the erm ii , so the uk did n't really do anything towards that . 
   the eu has refused to guarantee rights of uk citizens in the eu , the uk wo n't make a unilateral guarantee of eu citizens rights because the eu is using people as bargaining chips . 
  that 's because the eu can not force 27 governments to accept that on a whim . 
  the uk did not guarantee stay , so why should any government of the eu ? 
  furthermore , you seem to ignore that to * stay * is one thing but to have access to permanent residency and basically an automatic worker permit , and also continued use of the ehic is not really a possibility . 
  why should british citizens have an advantage when it comes to this ? 
  british citizens outside the eu are non-eu citizens ( obviously ) so it now all depends on the negotiation outcomes on what exactly will be done . 
  you keep talking about `` the eu '' as if the eu has really a say itself , but if you take a look at how the eu works , you 'll see that it 's not really the huge scary monster some claim it is , it 's just our governments at work for most of it , literally . 
   you 're just bitter and unable to admit fault . 
  because the uk is leaving ? 
  i do n't really care for the uk , and if it 's your wish to leave then leave , i care far more about other countries in the continent like ireland or france , or italy . 
  the uk is a very nice country but i do n't think i really care whether you stay or not . 
  yeah i think prices are relative , and here minimum wage depends on your age and work arrangement ( no joke ) . 
  i think it depends , for example : when i lived in portugal , everything is cheaper , but everyone also earns less money , so i did n't notice a big diference there . 
  here in the netherlands , everything is more expensive but wages are higher , so it 's somewhat proportional . 
  krokets usually come in boxes for like 3 $ or 4 $ that include about 5 of them , and you can buy * one * kroket from febo ( literally a wall with drawers , you put money in , pull whatever you wan na eat out , it 's so awesome ) for 1.60 $ all ready to eat . 
   you keep reasserting the eu is behaving according to treaties or that this issue is somehow part of negotiations . 
  there is no real issue , the uk signed treaties that stated the process of which it will leave the eu , and now the uk is leaving the eu , that 's literally it . 
  tell me exactly how do you think the eu made these decisions , and what you 'd want instead . 
  do you think that britain should leave the eu but still have a say on contracts that will never apply to britain since it 's leaving ? 
  the uk is leaving , so the uk needs to fully assume responsibility for itself and leave the eu behind so it can start negotiations of its own contracts and trade deals with the rest of the world . 
   you are not arguing in good faith . 
  i ca n't write it any more clearly ; while the exit negotiations are ongoing , the uk retains all rights and responsibilities of membership . 
  no , that 's actually a common mistake . 
  you retain all * access * to eu markets and funds until a deal is struck , but the uk 's say within the eu is limited , so the uk is no longer capable of having presidency of the european council for example ( which you were supposed to actually have but you decided to leave so you were skipped and estonia was next , now it 's malta , and then it 'll be bulgaria , and then austria , and so on ... ) . 
  the uk still has a say on matters that concern it in the short/medium-term of the 2 years it has to strike a negotiations conclusion with the eu but anything else is off the uk 's hands . 
   if the eu is going to discriminate against the uk when it comes to how money is spent , it should suspend demands for payment into the programs it is cutting off the uk from . 
  what the eu is doing is a violation of its own treaties . 
  the eu has no real power over how the funds are distributed as they rely solely on the application of the treaties ( which is like 80 % of what the eu does by itself , decision making is gravely at the hands of all 28 ( soon to be 27 ) national governments . 
  just look at the structure of the eu itself and you will see that there is no mystical `` eurocrat '' , there are just * directly elected * people as well as * your own government officials and appointees * there . 
  the uk is not being cut off from any investment programmes that apply to it as the ones it lost ( such as a lowering of investments made in wales and northern ireland ) merely are because they are long-term projects and only are made available for eu countries , so to fund a project in the uk that will take more than 2 years is nonsense . 
  your future , your money , but when it comes to for example the cap you are still in it just like the rest of us . 
  as for reduced payments , the uk already pays reduced payments ever since thatcher , because the uk has a rebate , so if you want to reduce it further go ahead , but do n't act surprised when the other 27 national governments refuse it . 
   as for the eurozone economy still has structural imbalances , high unemployment ( catastophically so in many countries ) and an unacknowledged banking crisis that has led them to repeatedly relax the stress tests . 
  i am from a eurozone country that was massively affected by the eurocrisis , and you know what the uk did ? 
  absolutely nothing . 
  so do n't act like your country cares . 
  the eu on the other hand provided us tonnes of funds and put pressure on our government to stop overspending to get us back on track , so it actually helped us from that crisis . 
  not to mention that nowadays the eurozone members all have a fund of hundreds of billions of euros put away in case of an economic downfall for a speedier recovery from the getgo . 
  should a country want to get off the euro without leaving the eu , that 's quite easy to do , just takes some time to design and mint and evaluate a new currency . 
   further , the fundamental problem of it being an non-optimal currency area without sufficient transfer payments has not been solved . 
  yet . 
  as you can read from the statements and agenda of the commission , negotiations are taking place in order to finish the euro . 
  the same was said about the ecsc , about the common market , etc. . . for years until it actually became complete , so it 's a bit of business as usual . 
   if the eu-uk negotiations break down the uk can at least respond . 
  it can , hell , the uk can even bring the eu to the ecj and try it , but the law is very clear when it comes to who pays what and has a say over what . 
  long-term projection of the uk 's say and investments are now frozen due to the fact that the uk is not a long-term member state of the eu . 
   eurozone nations will find themselves in a repeat of 2009 and are vulnerable to a return of depression economics , which never really left some members . 
  i 'm from one of those states and visited nearly all others . 
  you 're right to say that the crisis still plagues * one * of them ( greece ) but when it comes to portugal or ireland , we 're actually doing very well , and furthermore we now have security mechanisms to ensure a speedy response to any potential future problem when it comes to eurozone countries . 
  the role of the ecb is exactly that : ensure the stability of the currency , by means determined by all participating members . 
   the idea of having a trade war with one sixth of the eu 's economy is a monumental act of self harm . 
  same can be said for having a trade war with * the * biggest european economy alone ( germany ) as well as france , the netherlands , italy etc. . . , as well as the largest market in the world .
