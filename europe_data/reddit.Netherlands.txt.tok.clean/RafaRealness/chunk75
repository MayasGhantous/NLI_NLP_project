  what did i say wrong with that ? 
  its good for everyone to be able to choose isnt it ? 
  if you read that as a bitter response that 's on you , i 'm glad you 're leaving because you clearly do n't want to be in the eu . 
   i was gon na drop the ww2 thing cause it was a dickish comment from me . 
  but my only relative that died in ww2 died trying to protect france . 
  we were pretty safe on our little island with our navy and spitfires defending it , we certainly couldnt get blitzkrieged , pretty sure the uk didnt have to try and defend the rest of western europe . 
  yes , your relative died in ww2 , not you nor britain . 
  and i do not owe a debt or a thanks of historic events that greatly precede me and did not meaningfully impact those close to me . 
  it was not only a dickish move , it was a seriously tasteless one lacking manners and respect for other nationalities that have suffered at the hands of nazis . 
   an a us citizen rich . 
   eu behavior seems to be a bit childish okay so when you marry someone , and then divorce , your ex still has the full right to leech off of anything you do ? 
  the uk is leaving the eu therefore the eu 's future will not include it , why should the uk mind what the eu 's future in terms of contracting is ? 
  agreed , if both sides are sensible , then we 'll have a good and constructive relationship . 
   just curious about the homophobia part . 
  are there any studies you know about the behaviour of different animals towards homosexuals of the same species ? 
  i remember reading quite a bit when it came to hyenas in particular , as well as insects ( though their sexuality works very differently ) . 
   about your first paragraph , one could argue , that it is a kind of deterioration , if a member of a species decides to go against the evolutional pressure to have offspring ( which we could offset with technology to be fair ) . 
  but all throughout history there has been individuals not having ( by lack of means or by choice ) to not produce an offspring , so if this were a deterioration then it would have already eroded far more , yet here we are . 
  for me the real deterioration is a combination of economic factors and social ones . 
  higher educated young couples have lesser changes of having kids because of two main factors : the cost of opportunity and the financial investment and responsibility it is . 
  you could argue that we could solve the economic question by providing further financial elements to those whom generate an offspring , but the cost of opportunity of raising a baby and the stress of it ( let 's be honest , raising a child is an underrated amount of work ) can still be a big incentive not to ( not to mention the high level of commitment ) . 
  for me there should be a better system in place for adoption , as there are many couples whom by themselves can not produce a child and yet are restricted from adopting due to extremely complicated unforgiving paperwork that has been proven to be inefficient at deterring adoption to unfit households . 
  gay adoption should be allowed and destigmatized ( in fact , i believe that all adoptions to fit and capable households should be fully de stigmatized ) . 
  there is no fully-faced solution to the demographic change , however i believe that by focusing on maximizing the efficiency of our current populations at least part of these concerns can go answered . 
  * weeeeeeerk *, 
  that happens to me all the time . 
  my mom and i speak a mix of portuguese and french to each other , it creeps some of my friends out . 
   we do n't use the euro we use the pound sterling . 
  we would have had stability regardless of whether we joined or did n't join as our trade deals would 've remained the same . 
  the gbp is part of the erm ii . 
  the constant strike for currency harmonization has been * heavily * sponsored by the uk after the collapse of the brentwood system . 
  the emu ( aka euro ) was merely a step too far for britain ( and denmark ) . 
   oh did the eu create london ? 
  i was unaware of that . 
  no , but the eu * did * create the common market that the city 's economical might is so dependent on when it comes to passport rights for financial institutions . 
  considering the hefty part of britain 's gdp that depend on that alone , it would be quite disingenuous to say `` oh the eu did nothing '' . 
   i was talking to someone from poland for some reason . 
  you mean the communist dictatorship that was not at all in the eec nor the ec nor the eu up until 2004 ? 
  so britain became worse when poland became better since 2004 only then ? 
  what are you implying ? 
   ww2 ( you 're welcome ) seriously ? 
  i mean , * seriously ? 
  * i 'm surprised you even think i 'm dutch . 
  i merely * live * in the netherlands . 
  check my flair 's text . 
  i am half portuguese half french , and i have absolutely ** nothing ** to thank britain for . 
   i tried to google but could n't find anything . 
  my area is amber valley if you want to look for yourself . 
  [ considering how extremely easily it was for me to find a derbyshire funding scheme that effectively invested in your areas ] ( https://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/community/lottery_funding/european_funds/default.asp ) i am going to call bullshit on that . 
   i do n't know how this is a defence of the eu 's weird papers but while the people of scotland vote to remain part of the uk , they will remain part of the uk . 
  they 're currently choosing to stay , end of . 
  let them have a referendum , seems like a good idea since the no thanks campaign put so much stress on continued eu membership ; which of course is not the case . 
  i do n't care much for its outcome but i * do * care that scotland has a say about its future , same for wales and northern ireland . 
   i 'm just trying to say that i think the uk can probably have an ordinary trade deal with the eu , tariffs are very low around the world these days anyway . 
  i do n't think we 're going to join the single market or anything no yes , that 's what 's been announced for months now , and yet we are * still * waiting for the uk to formally leave the union , and lose passport rights for financial markets within , which do not depend at all on those types of tariffs and instead are merely * far far far * more hard to access , if not downright impossible . 
  furthermore the uk will lose ** all ** its say and veto power in eu policy . 
   only when selling to the single market though . 
  people seem to miss this for some reason . 
  the uk can sell to other countries without following single market regulations whilst simultaneously following single market regulations and selling to the single market . 
  they could even get creative and follow both sets of regulations and selling to both sides if they wanted . 
  correct , that 's what has been done , however by doing so you are making produces have to make two versions ( or more ) of the same product which will make the task more difficult ( look at produce mass exportation from the us into the eu for an example of how complicated this can be ) and you are entirely putting the economy of northern ireland at risk as it ** heavily ** resorts to its fully open border with the republic of ireland to try and stay afloat , without mentioning the social questions . 
   it is n't countries that sell to countries , it 's companies that sell to countries . 
  while we were in the eu companies could only follow eu regulations , but now we 're out , the companies are free to pick and choose as they wish . 
  if they wan na sell a modified product to australia whilst selling an eu product to the eu , they are now free to . 
  we can now also buy what we want as a country , if we think the eu 's regulations on crops are too strict , we can buy from someone else . 
  if we think they are n't strict enough we can change our regulations so that the eu companies ca n't sell to us . 
  glad you 're leaving then . 
  or at least you should be , in 2 years . 
   but we still have to contribute to the general funds ? 
  you mean like * literally every member state * ? 
   we have bent over backwards to be fair since the vote . 
  the eu is using up all its goodwill . 
  all you * have * to do is leave . 
  fairly simple and straight forward . 
  the referendum for me showed quite clearly that there is a divide between pro and anti eu sentiments among the british public and and i agree that disingenuous campaigning on both sides for political and commercial gain ( newspapers sell ) is to blame . 
  i believe that brexit * does * mean brexit and that although the slogan is void of any meaning , the point of it is that brexit will happen regardless of what brexit is , and the sole thing i truly wish is for the uk and the eu to keep on having a strong amical relationship in the future . 
  but i can trade the kroket for some tulip bulbs , start a very small-scale business , money launder everything at the belastingdienst , and generate enough profit for * more * kroketten !, 
  yeah exactly , i mean , i am pretty sure this is not news in neither side ; it 's not news for remainers , for brexiters , for the british , for the eu ... news seem more and more sensationalist , it 's troublesome . 
  ** getrikkered **, 
   yeah well in the uk we didnt see improvements sure , i 'm very certain that the currency stability , the trade with other eu members , the london finance capital , the massive amount of british citizens able to live elsewhere etc. . . is not at all an improvement . 
  back to passports and goods declarations , like countries such as serbia . 
   our country was getting better because ours was slowly getting worse . 
  worse ? 
  how ? 
  you grew economically , before the eu the uk was literally called `` the sick man of europe '' and i am fairly sure you can guess the reason . 
   i literally know of nothing in my area tbat has been improved by being in the eu that i can physically see like you said , i only know of factories being shut down because of european competition and the uk not being allowed to protect them . 
  so basically the uk is not competitive enough ? 
  the uk still is a very powerful member within the union in terms of production , and you keep mentioning that `` the eu keeps moving the money '' which is called the cohesion policy , aka investing billions per year in poorer regions of europe ( like for example eastern poland or northeastern france ) to ensure that nobody is left to sink out . 
  the reason why you probably do n't see any materialization of eu benefits is probably because you never sought to know what the eu does in your region , how it acts , who represents it etc. . . 
  the eu has terrible pr that is extremely true , and it * does * have problems , one in my opinion is lack of full diffusion of what they are actually doing unless you are very directly concerned . 
  so please , i want you to go out and find out what the eu is in your region , who 's behind it , where the funds go ( and what they are ) . 
   the uk came to exist because the people and laws in england , wales , northern ireland and scotland naturally became the same and very similar . 
  the people in england and scotland had been treated as the same peoples for hundreds of years before a piece of paper was signed to make them one country . 
  i could say the same thing about czechoslovakia though . 
  or also catalonia and spain , the ussr , etc. . . and the fact that scotland now is having a strong independence movement should be a warning call that there is no longer a case of cooperation but rather domination of one over the other . 
   yeah i agree with everything you said about trade , just specifically not being in the eea . 
  i believe we will have a good deal but i do n't believe the uk gov will give up any democratic control for a trade deal , and i dont believe the eu will shift its stance on requirements to be in the eea . 
  to sell to the single market you will have to meet single market regulations , if you want to be inside it and * not * be a member state of the eu then you will be giving up on having a say on what these regulations are , plus , the single market is a * single * market as the name indicates , so britain 's disruptive sudden problem with freedom of movement is obviously going to be a problem . 
  i 'm gay tho . 
  remember when italy and the uk were excluded from the european exchange rate project due to constant lack of capacity to follow the preset requisites ?
