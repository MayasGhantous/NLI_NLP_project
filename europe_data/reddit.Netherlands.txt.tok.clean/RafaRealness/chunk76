  or when austria lost some of its powers temporarily in the 90s ? 
  it actually is n't ( * technically * ) , but it is on nobody 's interests to attribute contracts that are in practice unfollowable after a certain period . 
  the uk should leave asap and have its own contracts . 
  ehm ... context ? 
  enlighten us , in * full graphic detail *, 
   because it is n't a factual or physical thing that can happen , and it 's also odd to artificially try to produce something like that rather than let it happen naturally , so what actually causes the thing to be real and proceed ? 
  the bit of paper ? 
  that 's why it does n't read serious to me , it sounds like the slogan for a product . 
  how often do you actually believe that you just brought the best razor with the smoothest shave ? 
  by this , the uk government should n't exist since it 's all , just as the eu , papers in the air . 
  i trust in the eu because i * physically * noticed benefits for my life and those around me , in the areas of education , of movement between borders , currency exchange ( or lack thereof ) , further opportunities for myself that no longer are restricted to * one * place in europe . 
  the uk government on the other hand never did shit for me , so can i say that the uk government is artificially trying to produce something like , say , a united kingdom ? 
  take a look at the achievements that the eu has done throughout its short existence in the domain of peace , economic prosperity , coordination , and even the protection of democracy and justice . 
  before joining the eu my country was fucked because of a fascist dictatorship that only ended in * the 70s * and we even had a neighbor we were very prone to have conflicts with back in those days , yet now with the eu , we have a better economic standing than ever before ( even * with * the crisis ) and nothing but fond and friendly ties with our past enemy . 
   yeah its the uk govs fault i totally agree , i do n't know why we j\u00f2ined . 
  i personally prefer local governments , i dont think the uk needs less democratic control by giving powers to europe , i think the regions in the uk need to be given more of that power . 
  yeah it would have been good to be in the free trade area but its was too late for that now aha . 
  it is not too late , a free trade agreement with the uk is still very much in the mutual benefit of the eu and the uk , and the door of the efta ( though norway 's pm already hinted they * might * veto a british entry into it ) is somewhat open still . 
  what truly is a concern is freedom of movement and passport rights for companies in the uk : london hosts a plethora of financial companies that greatly rely on the uk 's membership to the common market in order to access * the world 's biggest single market * but now with brexit that is very much debated , and considering how important access to the common market is for the british economy then the uk will probably strive for a trades deal with the eu , or at the bare minimum a transitional plan . 
  the same works the other way around , the eu obviously is not happy to see a member leave and is going to lose part of its trade with the uk , countries like belgium , france , and spain , export a considerable amount to the uk and obviously no member state wants to lose a trading partner ; so it is in the eu 's best interests to negotiate a trades deal ( or transitional plan ) with the uk . 
  brexit may be full of shitstorms by the media , but the reality is far less grim and far less dramatic . 
  nobody knows what brexit will possibly look like , but considering it is in both sides ' interests to keep trade an amicable element of their relationship , it is easy to speculate that a beneficial deal will be reached * unless of course * may decides to ridicule herself ( as she is prone to do , especially in that infamous european council , seriously we still joke about that in my university ) and demands the impossible . 
  yeah , it 's been doing so , and having the uk not participate in certain talks via an approved decision of all competent organs , it is perfectly within the ranges of its functioning . 
  it has been the case even before the uk joined in , so even in the eec there have been mechanisms in place that , with approval of the competent organs , can exclude a member state from certain talks under certain extreme circumstances . 
  cake ? 
  we never said anything about a cake !, 
  username relevant . 
  you can leave the eu in about half a day technically , but it 'll be ** far ** more economically costly for both sides with no transitional model . 
  the uk is leaving in 2 years ( maybe less , maybe more , but let 's hope it 's as quick as it can ) so why should it have a say on any trade negotiations that will not apply to it ? 
  to undermine the eu ? 
  furthermore , the uk can talk to other entities about trade deals , however it * can not * sign anything official as the uk is still part of the european union and thus the common market , which in practice means that it needs to be like all member states and have the same deals all the union gets ( we 're a customs union , remember ? 
  would n't work otherwise ) . 
  the second the uk gets out it is free to do as it pleases , but until then it must respect the treaties it has vowed to follow . 
  * well there are ways to fix that i assure you * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   fair enough it does n't sound to be taken seriously though i 've got ta say . 
  what makes you say that ? 
   the people in the uk were constantly told this was n't the case , right up until we voted to leave , david cameron was saying that there wouldnt be further political integration . 
  his lie was probably stopping leave from winning by a landslide , i believed him over nigel farage . 
  so because of the misinformation present in the uk for decades and blatant lies made by politicians , the eu now has to deal with 2 years of negotiations with people of the likes of bojo and may . 
  it is nobody 's fault but the uk 's that the people were constantly told otherwise , whereas the eu 's treaties , full documentation , explanations etc. . . have been available to the public for years on end , yet nobody seems too bothered to consult anything . 
   if you know that nobody in the uk wants to have the country merged , can you actually blame us for leaving ? 
  no , i mainly blame the uk government for joining . 
  should you want this to be fully trade-focused , an fta would suffice , or even the norway option of joining the efta would be a better choice . 
  but no . 
  best to join \u00e9h ? 
   uk acts like a girl that used to be part of an orgy group , decides to leave it because wants to have 100 % control on whom she sleeps with and then starts complaining nobody from the group is calling her to have sex anymore . 
  thinks is because they are bitter she decided to leave . 
  you 're not wrong ... but ehm ... are you speaking from experience in the orgy scene or ... ? 
  well i mean ... is anyone surprised in the least ? 
  if the uk is gon na leave the eu then the uk is gon na be responsible for its own self and not rely on contracts with the eu , same with passport rights for companies . 
  brexit means brexit , so just get on with the shitfest . 
  communists again ? 
  i 'm not too familiar who else would warn beforehand before attacking in greece . 
  if i say muslim communists do i win either way ? 
  homosexuality is found in hundreds upon hundreds of species in nature , and in the scientific community it is treated as a mere characteristic as there is no actual deterioration in terms of health , live expectancy , society contribution , special needs , and it can not be transmitted . 
  homophobia is found in only * one * species in the world : humans . 
  through the ages homosexuality has been regarded as normal , and then as unacceptable socially , so the mere definitions of what is acceptable and what is not change all the time ( kindly remind yourself of how women were `` diagnosed '' in centuries past ) . 
  it also fueled numerous atrocities against humanity , including the massacre of thousands during ww2 as well as even torture camps in the usa , and state-obligated `` therapy '' of alan turing that drove a genius to suicide . 
  well , to be precise it 's the flag of the council of europe , and it excludes belarus . 
  * nearly * all europe . 
  edit : kosovo is n't in the council of europe , but depending on your opinion on who the kosovar area belongs to , it technically can count as an outsider state ( kosovo ) or as a represented part of another state ( serbia ) . 
  the treaty of rome explicitly said that * the whole entire project * was the creation of , and i quote , `` an ever-close union of the peoples of europe '' . 
  this is the treaty that has created the european economic community and euratom ( the ecsc was created mind you that this treaty was originally signed by belgium , luxembourg , ( west ) germany , france , the netherlands , and italy ; in the year 1957 . 
  other members ( uk , ireland , denmark in 1973 , and further enlargements throughout the ages ) must have had to sign the treaty and accept the clausules within . 
  the uk knowingly entered `` an ever-closer union of the peoples of europe '' and at times even supported further integration of the supranational type . 
  it is understandable that the eu has grown considerably , but this has always been a clear goal and in fact indispensable for its continued running and existence . 
  whereas the 1957 treaty of rome has been a strong push towards putting an end to tariff based obstacles to trade within europe , several other obstacles came to light , some aspects of european 's lives appeared such as for example an unreliable system for currency exchanges after the end of the brentwood system , or the continuous and tedious task it was to deal with non tariff-based obstacles to trade ( such as different standards and regulations for different states . 
  claiming that it was nothing but a trade union is merely looking at its initial steps , before the maastricht treaty , before the single european act , etc. . . no doctor was born as such , we all were mere fragile little babies one day of our lives , and perhaps one of the most ambitious economic and political projects in modern history may take time to develop as well ; but it never was meant to be a simple trades deal . 
   eu  empire  anarcho-capitalism k then . 
  that line of thought is pretty damn dangerous to be honest , take a look at countries who took their national symbols to the extreme of sacred estate . 
  i respect national symbols but be aware of their real value and application , instead of starting with sacrilegious worship . 
  i fail to see how any flag is being disrespected in this context at all , as i see the tricolor fran\u00e7ais still proudly waving as well as the eu flag . 
  i sorta always scroll down to see what he 's got to say this time . 
  he 's a bit like that troll from 4chan that you just read up for the hell of it . 
  honestly i do n't really care that much , but sometimes it 's worth for the occasional chuckle . 
  i wish . 
  one rain day ( of which there are plenty in the uk ) and she would be gone . 
  i never realized how big stalin 's dick is .

   `` tell us to kill , we will kill .

  if you put a man ahead of all of your country 's democracy , you pretty much do not deserve to vote . 
   israel , america and germany are creating pressure over our country to take our money away from us , '' he said .

   europe has to look at itself . 
  we do not have to yield to torture . '', 
  if europe were torturing turkey , there would be far more devastating consequences and actions . 
  this type of roast-based decimation has * got * to be against the geneva conventions , i 'm calling a mod . 
  ironically , the 4 + shift in the dutch keyboard will get you $ $ $, 
  how does 444 link up to george soros ? 
  seems like everything is about him jesus christ . 
  what 's the meaning behind their name `` 444 '' ?
