  `` well * i * do n't believe you ! '', 
  is this person even serious ? 
  reminds me of this one dude that said `` in my opinion that 's illegal ! '', 
  because somehow opinions = laws in some people 's heads ... 
  just killed a man !, 
  on an unrelated note , how was living in den haag ? 
  did you enjoy it ? 
  you can shoot it down , but it wo n't fall . 
  ** it 's titaaaaniiiiiuuuuum ** ... no ? 
  okay i 'll show myself out ... 
  this is the quality content i come to see in reddit . 
  huh , til . 
  what 's the horseshoe theory ? 
  huh ? 
  nah son you 're not going anywhere . 
  if the referendum goes to crap we still know that not all of you are crazy , and though it 'll likely take a while to put turkey back on the right track , i 'm sure it 's doable . 
  just hang in there !, 
  is ... is he ... ** this is real i can not ** it 's like the minister of justice of romania saying `` altra intrebare '' ( next question ) at every single question ... to the point that even ryanair made fun of him by making a poster with his picture and the text `` who offers flights for 15 $ ? 
  makes spicy telenovelas for toiletpaper like the sun, 
  voted spanish , i 'm portuguese ... * i feel so dirty and naughty but so alive * . 
  any comments afterwards ? 
  he seems like a ripe cunt , i mean , the uk and europe need to cooperate to make brexit work for both sides * and in comes this asshole * ... 
  came here to say this , beat me to it , damn . 
  exactly , it was a huge media hype about nothing ... any word on what happened to that lord ? 
  did he say anything else ? 
  we already tried that and spoiler alert the biggest part ( spain ) got a higher say than us in everything and if we base ourselves as a democratic state , we 'd again be subjugated like scotland is to england because we 're smaller . 
  spain and portugal are not the same historically , nor culturally , there is more reason to reunite czechoslovakia than there is a reason or even a possibility to reunite portugal and spain . 
  the eu is far more than a simple union nowadays though , it has its own supranational entities that hold a strong amount of decision-making power . 
  but still less than a state . 
  reality of the matter is , in political science at least , something like the eu is really hard to define because nothing before it was like it , so we have no reference to compare it to ( comparative analysis being a huge chunk of how we understand anything in this field ) so by being a sui genesis , it 's just ... well , itself . 
  i had an exam and this was one of the essay questions ( about the democratic deficit of the european union ) ... 
  i wrote something eerily similar . 
  paywall for me . 
  yo how about britain unifies with ireland ? 
  see how that worked out the last time ? 
  yep , that 's why we are n't united . 
  we are culturally different and do n't want to be under each other 's rule . 
  cooperation is better than domination . 
   i mean , the border between spain and portugal is already almost gone you can zip line from one side to the other !, 
  it 's great . 
  i 'm sorry , i misread your comment , you 're right . 
  i think that the efta works very well for what it 's worth . 
  obviously there are some debatable issues about it like following regulations from an organization you do n't have a say over , but in the case of having * access * to the common market ( while not fully being inside it ) this may be worth it . 
  an fta for norway , in my opinion , would make less sense as norway does not really have a lot of industries that are indispensable for the rest of europe ( perhaps for sweden ? ), 
  and it is no secret that full access to the common market has benefited their state considerably in terms of dropping prices and exporting . 
  the problem created was the norwegian/swedish border which is basically as open as it can , which results in technical smuggling eventualities between the two . 
  consider the hefty price of membership versus efta , plus , there have been referenda for norway to join the eu , and the norwegian voters have refused to do so . 
  they need to adhere to eu standards but some policies are not a part of the efta deal . 
  i would love for them to join , but i do n't blame them for not doing so . 
  well , it 's not * just * their fishing industry , it 's a multitude of things that would suck for them if they were a * full * member of the eu right now . 
  the eu is not perfect , it has problems , and some of its flaws would affect norway a lot , so i think the efta is a good middle . 
  and norway i think . 
  i love norway and i 'd love to see them in the eu along with us , but i admit that the eu membership would be pretty damn shitty for them regarding their fishing industries , so i 'm happy at least they are in the efta instead . 
  i think it 's the typical stereotype of the englishman ( bowl hat n suit ) . 
  so i 'd go for the uk . 
  but a very nice source of sodium , mind you !, 
  us prez 2 : electric bungaloo . 
  it is a very salty dish , i let it boil for a few days and add some parsley whilst i 'm at it . 
  wilders `` winning '' dutch elections ? 
  * seriously ? 
  hopefully all he 'll do is sit at the desk and wait . 
  i 'd be pretty pissed if he just decides to step down and the us leader becomes a dude who supports electroshocking me because i find guys hot . 
   it 's unfair when students in the uk are suffering since brexit , tuition fees interest rates have skyrocketed to 6.9 % and since implementing tuition fees the # 21,000 repayment threshold has not raised in line with inflation . 
  tuition fees have been raised to # 9.25 k per year . 
  this for me is ignored to a * huge * extent . 
  plus i also feel very sorry and worried about british students in continental europe , because without eu-citizenship there is no saying that , in the case of the netherlands , their annual tuition fee will go from 2 000 $ to 8 000 $ or if they will need a study/work visa , or even if their education here will 100 % hold the same value it does at home . 
  just like there are problems for * any * student in the uk ( british or not , since the tuition fees are going up for everybody ) , british students even * might * get screwed over in continental europe by losing certain key rights and guarantees with brexit . 
  * `` just a prank bruh '' *, 
  the economist is a bit known to trash talk france even with no reason . 
  every time it 's about france you best believe that france is at the brink of total collapse and despair ... 
  yet nothing happens , france just keeps being france . 
   they sell the best pasteis de nata around . 
  ** como te atreves !? 
  i like them , they 're pretty nice and fun . 
  i think that they are an important part of dutch culture and identity , yet i am also happy that they are not an important part of dutch politics at all . 
  the king 's role is merely ceremonial and that 's the way i like it . 
  one or two stores who , by the way , do * not * get that much attention is n't really gon na change my views . 
  compare misterb to the street east of it , how many cheap non descript sex shops do you need ? 
  san escobar / s, 
  amsterdam centrum seriously there are so many other great parts to the city , hell there are other cities entirely that have great views , yet all tourists care about is cheap cannabis-flavored everything shops , low quality sex shops , and food . 
  this looks like a public aquarium 's logo , where 's this from ? 
  i believe that any border in the island is not justifiable and i believe that not only ireland should most definitely veto any deal that causes such a turn of events , but i also believe that the eu must not accept such a deal to begin with . 
  if the good friday agreement is not going to be honored what good is the uk 's word on anything to begin with ? 
  none that i can think of , except perhaps this [ one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_movement_in_the_netherlands#/media/file:wappen_nsb_1931-1936.svg ) which were the nazi movement 's dutch iteration . 
  their programme very much followed italian and german fascism but it was n't antisemitic before 1936 . 
  then that year it went full-on antisemitic and shit went quite south for it from there until nazi germany invaded , and banned every other political party ( quelle surprise ) . 
  since they were the only ones , they basically were in charge and kept the netherlands under german orders . 
  in 1944 they fled to germany because they feared the netherlands was about to be freed from the nazis , and by 1945 they were not only brought down in the netherlands but also fully banned from ever entering politics again . 
  they make is look even better . 
  / s nah but in all seriousness belgium 's got some fucking good fries , and no they are not overrated . 
  plus , their engineers and architects got stuff under control usually , and they have some of my favorite monuments like the atomium . 
  germany is pretty awesome at producing pretty much anything , they just make things very well i guess , even extremely precise materials like custom denture teeth or glass eye replacements . 
  they also have some good goddamn museums in berlin ( seriously recommend ), 
  i would n't want to live in the emptier parts of the east or limburg . 
  i am not a nature fan , i want a cozy urban area with a damn public transit system and stuff to do , not fields of wheat and potatos . 
   eastern but i heard bratislava is lovely !, 
  no , not really . 
  racism in the netherlands definitely exists against certain groups ( mainly moroccans and turks ) but recently it has n't gone up since , let 's say , 2001 . 
  2001 we got 9/11 , then in 2002 we had a politician ( pom fontuyn ) who criticized islam murdered , in 2004 we had a film director ( theo van gogh ) who made a movie criticizing islam as well and another movie about fontuyn 's murder . 
  tensions against muslims have been pretty present because of such events , and the fact that we still have problems with unintegrated parallel societies within the netherlands does n't do any good to stop it .
