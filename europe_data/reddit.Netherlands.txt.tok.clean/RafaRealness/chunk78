  i would n't say it has * risen * recently , i think it stayed around the same . 
  i consider it a very minimal threat based on our dependency for gas . 
  i consider it a far bigger threat for countries that are in the eu and thus we also need and should care about like the baltics . 
  `` wow you 're so exotic !, 
  you must get that a lot , right ? '', 
  british tourists . 
  never before have i ever been so triggered . 
  ** who the fuck just straight-up calls someone exotic ?? 
  ... okay i admit i fucked that part up . 
  crap now we 're gon na have to let them be europe too . 
  as if kazakhstan was n't bad enough . 
  portuguese , spanish , french , english , italian , some russian , some dutch , some german , some chinese , and * the language of looooove *, 
   what is your opinion on the opposite gender in your country ? 
  they 're alright ? 
  i do n't really care much about gender  do you think they are attractive ? 
  nah , i think they can be pretty and whatnot but i only date dudes ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ give ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ fuccbois ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ chance, 
  i 'd say portugal but i 'm biased beyond measure . 
  we 've got a region called friesland i guess ? 
  they 're culturally their own thing , they also speak their own language . 
  ... they are * all * european in culture , and quality of life ranges even in the west , or do you think that there 's no poorer countries like , say , portugal and greece ? 
  all post-soviet countries are european , * fully * european . 
  whether you like them or not that 's your own judgement but it 's stupid to pretend that because they 're poorer that suddenly europe 's entire historical and geographical definitions should be redrawn to make the east just asia or something . 
  90 % of my german was probably learned through them , so yes . 
  are ... are you okay ? 
  that is a lot of social interaction for a finn, 
  yes , definitely . 
  czech sounds like a more mouthy cute polish , whereas russian sounds like ... well , russian . 
  i 'm actually a gay portuguese dude . 
  what ? 
  i 'd like for there to be a mixed system : there will be political debate on which areas should remain together and which one should be altered . 
  i believe that bigger states like germany or france , who suffer sometimes from dissonance among its regions , should be a bit split up in terms of administration to make it manageable , however i do n't see why the netherlands and belgium ( except maybe wallonia ) would need a different administration . 
  so i 'd like for there to be a more thought out dual approach of unifying certain parts that do n't make much sense being divided ( luxembourg for example should join a bigger portion ) as well as make sure that bigger states do n't get messed up due to internal dissonance ( like bavaria in germany ) . 
  oh fuck i did n't notice it , haha . 
   historical linguists lose their shit over lithuanian am amateur linguist , can confirm , lithuanian is fucking amazing . 
  ... fuck i keep forgetting there 's also a german linguistic community there . 
  belgium : the country that keeps on giving ^ ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ ^ gib ^ ^ ^ ^ zuid ^ ^ ^ ^ brabant, 
  why do i feel like if i put these on google maps i 'll see the outline of a mighty dick ? 
  well usually i 'm interested in the more * masculine * meals ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  do you get a choice on this ? 
  what if i speak both dutch and french fluently , and do n't really identify with one more than the other ? 
  there 's no real expectation , everyone just order what they want and never really get judged for it . 
  ** unless you happen to order an american beer , which is like riding a canoe ** / s, 
  these have confirmed my stereotypes of czech sexual hungers . 
   the sequence of languages on a belgian passport reflects the holder 's affiliation to a linguistic community . 
  how so ? 
   have to relearn the civilian way of thinking and living . 
  what are the differences between the two ? 
  would you like there to be more support for veterans than there currently is ? 
  if so , what do you think should be done ? 
   country - amsterdam  city - amsterdam centrum  neighborhood - caf\u00e9 batavia this is creepy , i 'd say exactly the same thing , except i 'd replace caf\u00e9 batavia with the area around the bijlmer arena ( if i lived near centrum it would probably be a caf\u00e9 called sanders ), 
  what are your criteria for `` attractive '' ? 
  an aruban the other day said i 'm one of the hottest person he 's met and that i look exquisite . 
  meanwhile a pole rejected me on a date because he 's not attracted to me . 
  sooooo it can go either way . 
  you 've mentioned previously in this thread that you volunteered . 
  what made you choose to pursue a military career ? 
  what was studying for your position like ? 
  do you feel there is or ever was a stigma against military personnel ? 
  now that you 're retired , are you happy with your current situation ? 
  what are your plans for the future ? 
  sorry for the heap of questions , i 'm genuinely interested . 
  / r/rupaulsdragrace it 's a subreddit for this show about drag queens competing . 
  i 've learned a bit of danish , finnish , and some czech ( which i very much count on coming back to ) . 
  these were mere hobbies of mine , when i learned any other language it was more serious or even scholar , though those are all more mainstream languages . 
  did it 6 years ago , best decision ever . 
  my country ( portugal ) was going through some pretty piss poor times economically , and the school i was assigned to was in horrid shape ; i genuinely was n't learning anything and kept getting treated like a joke if i tried sometimes . 
  furthermore , i just did n't believe that i should stay all my life in the same country , and should instead explore and choose , by myself , where i want to live in . 
  in portugal , lots of people leave and i thought to myself that perhaps there was a good reason for it ( and yes there are some ) . 
  ... compared to dh ; sncf , cp , etc. . . we are ** very ** damn lucky about our trains . 
  i 'm the sole single-child of my whole entire family , and the reason is that my parents got it right the first time . 
  i might want kids in the future , but i seriously do n't see myself having more than one kid . 
  i think that belgium has by far the best looking passport in the world externally , but its pages are pretty uninspiring . 
  for the inside i 'd say norway wins by far , especially with its simple yet very norwegian design , and that aurora is just great . 
  if we could have the belgian cover template , and the norwegian internal design , i 'd be so happy . 
  in portuguese there 's the word `` saudade '' that ca n't really be translated . 
  basically it is the bittersweet nostalgic feeling of remembering something you love but is n't there , sorta defined as `` the love that remains '' but even so it runs even deeper . 
  i once heard a funny one on reddit , lem me explain : the netherlands has a part of it that has a lot of cities and urban areas called the randstad , where you will find amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague , etc. . . 
  the big cities basically . 
  as you can guess this is where a lot of company 's headquarters happen to be located . 
  the eastern part of the netherlands is ( relatively ) empty as hell , which includes drenthe , gelderland , groningen etc. . . 
  however it is also quite rich on resources ( such as gay in groningen ) . 
  unfortunately , the eastern provinces are n't as rich as the ones within the randstad , though there 's cohesion funds specifically for this . 
  here 's the cooky part : a redditor once had this theory that the dutch government was actually super corrupt and wanted to make the randstad great while screwing over the rest of the country ; because the gas companies in groningen and such all had their headquarters in the randstad , so the rest of the netherlands was essentially a colony of the randstad . 
  that for me reminded me of those germans who think the federal republic is actually a massive company . 
  i really like the polish bank notes for the zloty , especially the numbering followed by a symbol and coloring . 
  * maybe we 're not part of the cool kids oh god *, 
  well , somewhat yes . 
  the big cities generally are pretty accepting and show no signs of being against gay people ; but once you get to the really rough neighborhoods ( such as margem sul ) or small traditional villages , then homophobia is definitely present . 
  keep in mind that being gay is n't something that in portugal is treated like in the netherlands . 
  whereas here in nl nobody gives two fucks about it , in portugal it still rings some alarms and permanently labels you as `` that gay guy '' due to the fact that opening up to the lgbt community is still a recent development with far less history than the netherlands . 
  overall the conditions are n't bad at all for gay people in portugal , there are some drawbacks ( such as adoption ) or some social discrimination ( not to an extreme point , just an annoying constant label and still a `` shock '' factor attributed to gay people ) ; but it is * not * at all a bad place to be gay in . 
  it 's not to the level of the netherlands , but i 'm happy to see that progress is taking place , and that being gay , more and more , is okay . 
  yes , it 's extremely obvious , but you 'd be amazed at the number of foreigners who do n't know anything about stille willem ( aka the mc daddy of the netherlands ) . 
  sorta , i 'm listening to cupcakke because i am secretly a big bowl of garbage in private , ` ayyy, 
  yeah that happens to me quite often in the netherlands as well , for example i was just chilling with a group of dutch people , and everyone 's just relaxing and chatting and they start talking about dutch rappers and they were pretty weirded out that i knew absolutely none . 
  i think you can guess what i 'm listening in spotify right now . 
  i 'm a foreigner in the netherlands so fuck yeah this thread  language this is the most important one i 'd say , you can not , will not , shall not form really good dutch friendships without speaking dutch . 
  it is readily available to learn so no worries about that : but seriously it matters a lot . 
   employment well , the dutch tend to be more reserved with their jobs and money affairs and such so i 'd say that as long as you 're doing * something * and not just lazing around you 'll be fine . 
   values this is a complicated one .
