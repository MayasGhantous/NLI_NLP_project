  you need to fully respect that the dutch often believe that you can do whatever the hell you want as long as you do n't interfere with others ' wishes to do so as well ; but you can also keep your own values private . 
  there is a balance and definitely a line where you yourself judge what is wrong and right , and what should be up for free choice within society . 
   religion this , again , is a topic that among the dutch is kept more private than you 'd expect . 
  you can have any religion you wish but nobody really will talk about it , and i 'd say that if you 're a muslim or if you wear really visible religious clothing ( like a kipa or something ) i 'd say there might be a bit of a stigma . 
   spending past time i have n't noticed any particular thing that would require integration on this front . 
  you do what makes you happy , really . 
   knowing your country 's popular culture like movies or music this in the netherlands i 'd say is quite important because in order to talk to dutch people and immerse yourself within their society you 'll need to know topics to talk about ; so why not discuss some dutch movies or music ? 
  everyone knows some and it 's the easiest topic that everyone discusses and shares . 
  history is quite important too in order to understand a lot of different parts of the netherlands ( like for example , you 'd have to understand the voc ) but i think this is more of a bonus thing that will help you understand rather than be viewed as integrated ( unless you 're asked about history of course ) . 
   do you have any stories about foreigners who integrated successfully ? 
  i 'd say that i integrated pretty seamlessly in france when i was younger , so now i 'm a dual portuguese french citizen . 
  i went to school there and quickly became your average jacques by focusing on learning about the french lifestyle and going for it . 
   how about those who did not ? 
  there 's lots of portuguese people in france who do n't integrate well ( bad french , very loud , overly nationalistic , etc. . . ) and they are the absolute source of stereotypes of portuguese people in france unfortunately . 
  i 've got tonnes of stories about them because unfortunately a hefty chunk of my family is like that . 
  i 'd also add some pop culture references for the netherlands too . 
  i think that everyone should just brush up on dutch history , like the voc or who wilhelmus was and such ; and also obviously how the dutch government works in really simple generalized ideas . 
  i 'm really proud of the people here . 
  they are very honest , straight forward , no-shit attitude ; while also remaining helpful and great people to have a chat with . 
  this also reflects on the country itself , how everything manages to be pretty damn beautiful , but also services like public transit or education are efficient as all hell compared to others . 
  so i 'd say that this duality between a full ( sometimes brutal ) honesty and also a fun and happy attitude makes the netherlands unique and it 's what i 'm most proud of . 
  rich as hell , very interesting linguistically , direct democracy balls hard as fuck , * hella * xenophobic at times , hates anything and everything around it , banking system allows tax evasion , * way * too overly proud ( not america levels but calm down ) , absolutely amazing cities and ski resorts , also r\u00f6sti is the best . 
  this is n't what i 'd say what nl thinks since i do n't think there is a fully general view of switzerland , so this is my view instead . 
  `` we do n't want your money , mr trump , in fact , we already have it '', 
  ideally yeah , i 'm a bit open for discussion over it , maybe an alternative , but for now i 'd say monogamous only . 
  ah yes , just how i like my dams : ** thicc **, 
  well ... that 's basically what we did . 
  well , i 'm happy you chose the ** self-evidently superior and indisputably better ** dialect of the two, 
  what do you mean by `` repealed '' ? 
  amsterdam was fucked after ww2 , so was berlin ( even more ) . 
  washington dc was literally a swamp once , london got burnt the heck up , etc. . . how does this affect anything ? 
  furthermore , are you aware how reconstruction was carried out soon after ? 
  how marqu\u00eas de pombal affected the design of the city towards a more modern one ? 
  well that definitely will have us wonder how the fuck someone learned * european * portuguese considering that everyone and their mum chooses brazilian , and that even in games and such there is a brazilian portuguese version but often not a european portuguese version ( we use english instead ) . 
  ** i am triggered in two nationalities how dare you **, 
  ** new . 
  kids . 
  turbo . 
   goodbye lenin has to be my favorite german movie it 's my all-time favorite . 
   the portuguese make bad but cheap towels . 
  we do ? 
  i really like spanish accents in general , and the latin american ones for me sound pretty good still ; though my favorute by far still remains the castilian . 
  i do n't think there 's any beef at all with french and quebecois , in fact the accent sounds really cute to the typical frenchman , if anything there 's the most unnoticeable beef with the wallon dialect of french because they say octante and nonante . 
  oh , that is not * at all * like the dutch . 
  the dutch will talk to you , but be direct about what they want with not much care for your say . 
  there is absolutely no damn social block from an individual to directly talk to another one in nearly any situation should there be any need ; so in the street expect dutchies to just directly ask you for what they need , and in return you can pretty much do the same . 
  smiling and eye contact is also pretty average here , not a big deal , though if you stare or smile too much it 'll be considered really creepy . 
  i do n't really like the way it sounds , it just sounds quite ghetto to me . 
  as if a spaniard somehow had babies and spoke portu\u00f1ol to them in a ghetto in lisbon , that 's what it sounds like to me . 
  plus , a lot of stuff that is said in brazilian portuguese that is accepted ( especially different verb conjugations ) are mistakes that ** very ** poorly educated people in portugal often do in european portuguese , so it feels like i 'm talking to someone who 's not very bright . 
  i love brazilians , but ** not ** their accent at all . 
  did n't mean to pass any judgement , i honestly do n't think of her as good nor bad . 
  you asked what she did and , basically , she 's trump 's wife and thus drama etc. . . 
  eeehhh , i 'd say that generally europe ( and the netherlands included ) very much is full of judgemental people ( myself included ) and should they scope social awkwardness then they may not say it out loud but they will think it and judge it . 
  it 's not something good , but it is a reality : everyone 's * hella * judgemental , and social awkwardness ( at least in the netherlands ) is not very tolerated . 
  she picked the wrong sugar daddy . 
  i wrote an essay about them ... ** this is by far the strongest argument ever , fuck gema with a cactus **, 
  lots of foreigners never really get used to it . 
  a dutchie is * far * more likely to tell you what he thinks even to extents that for lots are considered rude . 
  talk about something you 're passionate about , and some may just look at you bored and say `` i really do n't care '' and move on directly . 
  or greet you by telling you how bad you look/did something . 
  i personally love it since it makes them more trustworthy ( no talking behind people 's backs ) but i notice that a lot of other foreigners often struggle with it . 
  if you are not an eu citizen , jobs will be ** very ** hard to get unless you are very sought after here . 
  if you are an eu citizen but do n't speak dutch , jobs will be ** very ** hard to get unless you are very sought after here . 
  the netherlands welcomes anyone , but do n't expect it to be easy at all to make a good living here . 
  decent low-wage jobs are all and plentiful and you can have a normal reasonable life with those salaries ; but do n't expect more unless you can * provide * more than the already very competitive market . 
  also , you ** will ** have to face dutch directness daily . 
  depends which one , i was raised in a trilingual household . 
  if a tourist speaks english or french to me it 's alright i guess , it 's common as hell if a tourist speaks * portuguese * to me , either i will cringe inside because brazilian portuguese creeps me the fuck out or i will be hella shocked i found someone who speaks european portuguese . 
  do n't ask me , i 'm ethnically portuguese as fuck . 
  i make chewbacca look bald . 
  genetics/ancestry : no priority given because you merely ** are a foreigner like all the others ** . 
  you are not your ancestors and your genetic code does not mean your better or worse than other potential immigrants skills : already very important and we have visas specifically for highly skilled people culture : well , the sole countries i 'd really say share a very close culture to the netherlands to a point that migration from these countries should be preferred are all in the eu and i 'm pretty happy about it . 
  measure your own happiness . 
  how much happiness = happy ? 
  what is the unit for happiness to begin with ? 
  furthermore , do you remain exactly as happy all the time ? 
  what is the period of variation of happiness units ? 
  it 's impossible to measure such a thing . 
  this is the most estonian/finnish logic i 've ever heard . 
  oddly enough i do n't think there 's a us accent i * do n't * particularly like . 
  maybe midwestern small village accents , and alaskan ; too nasal for my liking . 
  everything else sounds pretty cool ( also i can do a damn good brooklyn accent , call me bernie ) . 
  i would under the sole condition that my taxes would fund programmes that are exclusive to tax-payers . 
  i think the majority of the dutch population would pay taxes as well , though some would definitely opt out . 
  * hey baby , want us to fix that for you ? 
  think logically for a second : ** how do you measure happiness ? 
  ** these surveys often are garbage with no credibility to them ; bad sources about this sort of stuff * love * pointing to countries like sweden , finland , denmark , the netherlands , germany , belgium , etc. . . and say `` oh look how amazing and perfect they are ! '', 
  with ** the ** loosest facts ever . 
  danes are humans , lots of them are happy , lots of them are sad , you can not measure happiness . 
   soccer ** football **, 
  i 'm just sitting here waiting for a frenchman to school us all in the fine art of protest . 
  well , i sure would consider him a ** very ** bad historian to be honest . 
  does he believe that asia will ever regret that japan did n't succeed ? 
  sounds to me like one of those chinese `` academics '' that instead of actually researching just dish out papers supporting the party 's views . 
  i did some comparative studies between china 's and europe 's reconstruction after ww2 ; and chinese sources are iffy and unreliable as all hell . 
  because languages open up a ** fuck ** tonne of doors for your future ; very often i 've got very good job offers merely based on the fact that i 'm a polyglot . 
  also , the younger you start learning a language , the easier your first language it will be , and the more languages you learn , you build up a sort of linguistic aptitude via this exercise , making other languages easier and easier ; thus making the world more transparent for you to study and discover . 
  do n't forget that each language can also reveal a new view over the world , and also about yourself too ; plus by learning , say , russian , polish and ukrainina become ** far ** more accessible already and if you learn spanish then italian and portuguese do too . 
  we live in a continent with over 20 languages , where education is * highly * privileged .
