  i do n't really care , because geographically , it * sorta * is since we * are * definitely in eurasia . 
  culture-wise , history-wise , etc. . . there definitely is a ** biiiig ** distinction between europe and asia . 
  it would be like saying that all of indochina is just a chinese peninsula . 
  spain . 
  i went to lanzarote and stayed in my first ever resort ... which truly felt like a luxury concentration camp for british/german people who have little to no class nor shame . 
  spain itself was great , but * man * i hate resorts . 
  brazilian portuguese and european portuguese are very different . 
  both , however , are portuguese , just two very different dialects . 
  so far i 've only seen 1000mg , i think . 
  ` ayyy, 
   i wo n't say i 'm in love and pretty much all songs from hercules i will fight you  make men out of you from mulan ** i will fight you ** *** these all sound the best in european portuguese dare to fite me *** / s, 
  well , he * is * centuries old , maybe +50 ? 
  ya know , to screw the working class * and beyond !, 
  ** none you peasants ** / s, 
  one of the most controversial presidents from the us ( and that 's saying something ) due to his pretty poor economic choices privileging the rich over the poor ( further creating a bigger gap between classes ) and agressive foreign policy that often gets miscredited with the dissolution of the ussr . 
  he * did * do some good , such as protecting the west and such , as well as a ** very ** damn charismatic character ; credit where credit 's due . 
  he 's basically the stereotype of cold war america to me : `` we , fellow rich americans , will beat those dirty commies ! '', 
  well , bender definitely is the pvv for robots , but fry ? 
  fry is too much of an idiot even for the pvv i think , he is just a nice but incredibly painfully stupid guy ... maybe he missed the election or did n't vote because the ballot had too many choices . 
  uneven shoulder strap positioning makes your boobs look overly asymmetrical , plus they are a bit too tight giving her armpit a little bit of a fatter appearance than they actually are . 
  i 'm 20 , and i think the difference is that i actually remember the mid and late 2000s vividly . 
  it 's illegal and ** i dare you ** to fuck with the police over it ; but it still happens a little bit , and in my area it happens a bit too bloody frequently because half the people drive worse than parisians . 
  oh god now i feel like one of those hipsters that quotes old movies , even though the movie is relatively not that old ( 11 years ) . 
   experience immersing ourselves into the european culture ... wh ... 
  which one ? 
  that link included two prime examples on who should * not * to wear linne . 
  i can not do this myself for the netherlands since i 'm not that good with fictional characters of any sort , but ** please ** some dutchie do this for me oh my god . 
  i have no clue , i had someone else explain it to me one time . 
  [ a really bad dated joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfd2ggnxr1g ), 
  ** it 's what plans cra - ** wait that 's something else , is n't it ? 
   america comes last from all bread i have tried . 
  well , i 'd call it cake . 
  i fucking want a poster of this oh my god . 
   western/central/scandanavian european country, 
   $ 5.29 eur that is absolutely ** no way ** to live . 
  ^ someone ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ pun, 
  europe : netherlands ( sue me ) . 
  africa : angola . 
  asia : taiwan . 
  how to spell ljubljana , slovene accent in english , and tasty food . 
  as long as they do n't damage the castle nor bother anyone ; i think they are welcome to do as they please . 
  i think that there * must * be self-determination for both that does not at all degenerate into violence . 
  both sides of the argument , especially in the catalan case , have been polluted by arguments like `` you 're fascist if you 're against independence ! '', 
  or `` our constitution does n't allow it ! '', 
  and the like . 
  it 's really a shame , and i hope that there will be a good solution that guarantees the self-determination of both regions be it inside or outside of spain . 
  no insurance = no refund system in place . 
  sorry man , do n't think there 's any chance at all of you getting much of anything back . 
  ... yet portugal 's doing pretty well according to available data . 
  generally for the netherlands , we can best describe our population density as ** thicc **, 
  oddly enough i think that indonesia does n't have much of any influence in the netherlands . 
  we * do * however love their food and still have lots of indonesian gastronomy around ; i think that 's the most apparent . 
  the closest element we have with indonesia i 'd say would be our corporations investing in each other , as well as a recent research funded by both our governments to study what each side did during the independence war ( nothing agressive , very cooperative and determined to just bring closure to a bad period of our history ), 
  indonesians come here and already fully know that they * will * need to integrate , it helps that due to the previous colonial past ( that to be fair screwed over the indonesians ) there already there is more of a cultural connection between the two . 
  there also are thousands upon thousands of indonesians that have integrated during the time it was a colony , and generation of ethnically indonesian people that are 100 % dutch . 
  moroccans in the other hand have * far * less contact with dutch living and culture ; and instead of finding a preexisting community of moroccans whom , for generations , have all integrated very well within dutch society ; they have near parallel societies that * refuse * to integrate properly and whose offspring tends to be very poorly integrated , even * if * technically still dutch . 
  aaah , thanks for explaining . 
  so you agree with me : we have people abusing the welfare schematics available in the netherlands . 
  i disagree with you saying that it would cause more harm than good to face this issue . 
  what harm can truly be done ? 
  i 'm not saying removing any and all welfare benefits from people who genuinely need it ; i am merely saying that allocation to such funds to those who do not want to work as they should is to be carefully questioned . 
  well , 5 days for me is far too little , not to mention the limitations on cash carryings . 
  furthermore , even if it is easier nowadays for * some * countries ( some nationalities are required to get a visa and registration no matter what ) it does not really instantly build belarus ' reputation in regards to tourism and ease of access . 
  should belarus really fix its limitation of travel issues for tourists , ** and ** give it time for changes to make an impact in the overall image belarus conducts , then there should be more tourism towards minsk , brest , etc. . . 
  i , again , never said canada is * the * best . 
  that would be belgium for us , not denmark either . 
  have you been paying attention to my comments ? 
  jr is a puppet of jr ? 
  i 'm a bit confused . 
  where 's the lie tho ? / s we got memes for all parties i think ( [ here 's a good example ] ( https://i.redd.it/934pti40ug5z.jpg ) . 
  we unironically have a party called `` denk '' ( means `` to think '' in dutch and `` equality '' in turkish ) and they are often so ridiculous that you 'd swear they are actively trying to make le denk maymays . 
  i would forgive them * a bit more * but not fully if you call yourself dutch . 
  sure you can study the language and culture and try to visit ; that 's actually very good and we 'd love if an american studied dutch culture and languages and such . 
  this , however , * does not * make you dutch . 
  the * real * thing is that you still are an american , and if you * do * want to be called dutch , then you must come here and integrate here ; be a part of dutch society and fully be * with * us . 
  otherwise you can just certainly be seen as a weeaboo who is n't obsessed with japan but with the netherlands . 
  probably * everyone * except flanders for their incapacity to ** stay the fuck away from bike lanes reeeeeeeeee **, 
  this was the best piece of * literature * ever . 
  thank you . 
  well , it 's quite hard to visit , since you require an loi to enter the country and * some * embassies have extra requirements ( like having a precise plan on what you 'll do or contact services by a belorussian travel agency , or vouchers by hotels where you 'll be staying yet * only * from belorussian travel agencies ( so booking.com or trivago are invalid ) . 
  this without mentioning the huge hassle of the white slips and registration . 
  ( edit : utrecht is criminally underrated as fuck ), 
  that for me makes sense , since that makes sure nobody just pops in , demands asylum applications that take years , and take up employment . 
  my question focused on those who * have * been granted asylum and are meant to work ( as in , not disabled people or people still learning the language and customs ) . 
  nah , never been there . 
  yes , definitely . 
  we 're already so hyperconnected and have far more to benefit from friendly ties ( even without the eu ) that it 's to nobody 's benefit to start hating each other . 
  damn , beat me to it . 
  canada never did * half * the shit the us did to us , our interests never really clashed besides this one island denmark considers part of greenland but canada does not . 
  you keep saying `` i do n't care we fucked you over economically , dragged you into wars , already threatened to invade you , etc. . . why is canada better !? '', 
  because they * do n't * do this kind of shit , and they respect and cooperate with our projects . 
  do you not realize that the fact that these problems emerged from conflict of interests with the us are * precisely * the reason why i do n't see at all the us as a better ally ? 
  fokker was a huge aircraft manufacturer that got fucked after a huge commission by the us was underpaid because * suddenly * the us devalued the dollar to shit and refused to even aknowledge it . 
  that already was a * very * big hit considering how many people lost their jobs and how much was lost by that alone . 
  then there is all the diplomatic conflicts that the netherlands got dragged into , even including * an invasion plan * by the us being out in the open merely because the us thinks its citizens are above the hague 's international court of justice . 
  all these divergences make the us a far worse ally than other who actually treat us with mutual cordiality rather than a `` fuck you we 're awesome '' attitude . 
  potential does n't mean that you act upon it , because by those rates we 'd have to consider that russia is a better ally to the netherlands than suriname ; which as you can probably guess is absurd . 
  china has the * potential * to be a very powerful ally to south korea , does that make them a good ally ? 
   sorry ** i mean , where 's the lie ? 
  for the netherlands , i think [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snzbvz7hxyu ) fits how i see it .
