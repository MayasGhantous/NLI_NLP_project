  i never said such a thing ? 
  when did i say i wanted to ban refugees ? 
  i said that refugees who can work , should , and probably nobody is gon na disagree on their integration and inclusion in dutch society , correct ? 
  however , refugees are people and some , as you said , are bad apples ; and i 'd like to have criteria to distinguish them . 
  i believe that refugees are welcome as long as they are lawful and honest about their intentions here , not so much if they plan on mooching off the welfare system as even other non-refugees do too ; humans are humans and should be regarded as such . 
  i 'm not , i merely am concerned that refugees who are capable of work should do so ; you say `` yes they should , no need to worry ! '', 
  yet i still worry about the ones who * wo n't * and ask about how we make sure there is no option for them to just leech off of the welfare system . 
  refugees are people like you and me , and as mere humans some of them are bound to be overly opportunistic , dishonest , and even try to abuse the welfare system ( as * citizens * do too , nothing particularly new ) . 
  the stigma against refugees comes from these occasions , and should we have a way to address these cases rather than say `` oh no worries it 's fine ! '', 
  then perhaps the image we have of refugees would be ameliorated . 
  maybe we should just go back to the good ol' days / s, 
  hence why i talked about nuance . 
  see it as a mathematical equation where positive numbers are contribution , and negative numbers are deterioration . 
  the sum of them would either be a positive or a negative number or zero ( overall impact ) . 
  you can most definitely talk about the positive numbers , discuss them with more care ; but always nuance that there 's more to the story , there was a price to pay and never ignore the overall impact . 
  i 'm not saying he was overall good for portugal , i 'm just saying that he was not a * fully * negative horrible caricature and that though his impact ( in my opinion ) was worse-off for portugal ; i do n't ignore that he still did quite some good too . 
  yes , however how do we make sure that they do ? 
  we can not send them back to certain death , that 's fully clear ; however i do n't believe that the ones who can work should be given * any * option not to . 
  dragging us to war then ? 
  making fokker close its doors forever ? 
  you seem to still be fully focused on just gay rights and climate change , yet bring no arguments as to * why * the us is the best ally the netherlands has . 
   best integrated : indonesians though i agree that indonesians are extremely well integrated , i 'd say maybe belgians are the best integrated merely because it 's near-automatic for people from flanders to just integrate with us . 
  but * discounting * them who somewhat cheat ( since they are basically near identical to us relatively ) then you 're right , indonesians are very well integrated . 
  the thing is that even though he was a dictator who ended up causing immense suffering for tonnes of portuguese , angolan , mozambican , etc. . . people ; he still has contributed to portugal 's economy * a lot * and also its infrastructure development . 
  saying that the ussr benefited kazakhstan is n't a lie , it just needs to be properly nuanced to explain that there also was a * lot * of suffering involved . 
  yes , but how do you call a deadbeat out ? 
  under what criteria does a refugee become indeed a deadbeat ? 
  no , because you do n't answer my main concern : i believe that a refugee capable of work should do so ; if he does not what is the distinction between him and a deadbeat ? 
  refugees are people too , and as people some can be very good hardworking people , and others can genuinely be dicks . 
   by that logic why not give all the money away and be done with all the problems ? 
  you need to fund public services as well , remember ? 
  also , unregulated inflation can be a huge bitch . 
   i do n't know how it works in nl but here companies do n't pay vat to each other . 
  so after you make your first purchase , that money is in the companies hands ( minus the initial vat ) , after that what the company buys for that money is likely a service ( or profit to owners ) from another company who will not pay vat , and that company will buy a service from a third company who will not any vat . 
  those money are a gone , dude . 
  the only benefit is that people have jobs , but if you do n't want to work that 's a huge net loss . 
  here the system is more complicated and there are nearly always taxes regarding transactions between two companies . 
  the sole * really * bad part is * foreign * companies who store money here are not required to pay taxes under certain circumstances should they already have a sublet company here ( hence why the netherlands is accused of being a tax haven ) . 
  the belastingdienst has definitely its problems applying some of these tax laws though , i 'll give you that . 
  so now not discriminating your own population , not dragging * us * into war , not generating economic shockwaves that fucked over one of our companies , etc. . are `` progressive '' ideas ? 
   so you expect them to learn the language in `` the first few months '' ? 
  if you were suddenly dropped into a country whose language you did n't understand a single word of , would you feel confident that you could learn the language in `` a few months '' ? 
  i did , and again , i did n't specify * how many * months did i ? 
  i believe that if they achieve a b2 level of dutch , they can start actively looking for a job ( it 's the requirement to even become a dutch citizen ... ) . 
  take it as long as it takes i think it should be a priority to teach them how our country works and its language for them to not only be safe in it , but also know our different stances on , say , women 's rights and such , as well as make them more dynamic elements in our societies that fit better than just another parallel community . 
   you might note that it says nothing about their taxpayer status . 
  what a surprise , you do n't have to pay taxes in order to be considered a refugee . 
  yes , i know , yet i also believe you can be a refugee * and * abuse the welfare system . 
  it 's as if they 're * humans * just like us , oh wow !, 
   and if you really exercise those shriveled up and atrophied empathy glands , you might be able to see that whether or not people pay taxes , sending them back to the death they fled from is not a nice thing to do . 
  when did i ever say i want to send them back ? 
  i merely want the ones who came here that * are * capable to work to do so instead of staying stuck on welfare ...  i know it 's a lot to ask , because it requires you to think of brown people as human beings like you . 
  ** i am ** a brown person , i look pretty much the same as them in color , the sole difference is that i 'm from another country . 
   they may suffer from severe ptsd preventing them from functioning and carrying out everyday lives well , i was discounting * disabled * people , but okay ; thanks for the clarification . 
   even just getting permission to work as a refugee can be a long and complex process . 
  you 'd be surprised at how much effort most western countries put into preventing refugees from working . 
  we do n't want them to take our jobs after all . 
  and often , official policies are just to contain them until we can send them home , and letting people find jobs and start new lives would make that much more difficult . 
  again , i meant a refugee in the netherlands whose purpose here is to get to work after a period of adaptation . 
   then there 's the well-documented discrimination they may experience . 
  it is much harder to find a job when you have a `` foreign '' name . 
  more so if your grasp of the language is imperfect . 
  yet my dutch sounds pretty bad , i have an unspellable name here , and i can find a job * very * easily in amsterdam due to the already very diverse international community . 
   but hey , do n't hesitate to weaponize your ignorance in a drive to fuel even more hatred against refugees . 
  i mean , that 's cool and totally productive . 
  so me being concerned about a distinction being made between people in need of our help and just deadbeats = preaching hate ? 
  wow . 
  i agree , with that system to be fair , but only if it 's applied to refugees whom have already been through dutch language courses and are ready to integrate the labor market . 
  i 'm not sure , i mean i have no problems with refugees taking some time on welfare for the first few months or so , in order to learn the language and the cultural customs etc. . . 
  but where is the line drawn between a refugee in need and just a deadbeat who came here just to laze around doing nothing whilst the actual contributors pay for it all ? 
   refugees living of our wellfare , no . 
  they 're not refugees for nothing , they need help . 
  so they can not take the free language and culture courses available , integrate , and find a small job like everyone else ? 
  it would if it ever happened , in the netherlands there 's nobody who just * does n't * pay taxes , even if you are on welfare . 
  let 's do this mathematically and by stages : you get 500 $ from the government . 
  you spend those 500 $ in store a and as a result pay 200 $ in vat ( 20 % ) those 200 $ will likely go to someone 's salary and are going to be spent in store b , so that someone now pays 40 $ in vat and 160 $ to store b. 
  * then * in store b let 's say they decide to remodel the place , and hire a contractor , which again vat would apply , and would mean 32 $ would go to the government , leaving 128 $ etc. . . for every single travel this money does that does n't end up in a bank account , the government gets some of it back . 
  we started with a full 500 $ missing , and through vat alone we ranked up 272 $ back , as well as stimulate economic activity through creating a * teeny tiny * more demand for products ; which could result in a net * profit * for the government . 
  this process would likely keep going until all 500 $ are back , and could even push others to consume more ( thus generating additional vat ) since they have a small increase on disposable income . 
  `` facts do n't matter , your opinion is just weird ! '', 
  as i said : these are all small examples of multiple cases where the dutch and the american stance severely disagree . 
  germany , for example , never tried to drag us to war with iraq which believe it or not was a pretty bad time and a strain for the dutch , french , german , etc. . . to still regard the us as their respective best ally because on multiple occasions american interest * highly * clashed with ours . 
  you talked about how germany did not legalize gay marriage up to recently , yet germany already had civil partnerships as well as multiple protection laws to fight discrimination , whereas in some states in the us it 's fully legal to fire someone just because they 're gay * and * it 's no secret that a lot of communities are very homophobic ; not to mention the flip-flop attitude the american government takes on the matter . 
  what does america do for the netherlands that makes us amazing allies ? 
  especially in comparison with belgium , germany , denmark , france , etc. . . who all cooperate more * on an equal footing * rather than having a `` my way or the highway '' attitude . 
  i think that there merely is not a single call for it . 
  would it be nice ? 
  sure , but i do n't see it as important in the least ; plus trump would use it to bitch more and i do n't want to listen to him any more than i have it . 
  i think it 's a bit of a useless change in my opinion , and would possibly cost more money for little done . 
  we * can * ask these countries to impose such rules , but will they really ? 
  with as much scrutiny as we require ? 
  and who will pay for it ? 
  ... we have one ? 
  i mean , they 're okay i guess ? 
  we have 4 very similar trams in amsterdam : [ the bn serie 11g 901-920 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trams_in_amsterdam#/media/file:gvb,_11g,_920.jpg ) [ the bn serie 12g 817-841 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trams_in_amsterdam#/media/file:gvb,_12g,_822.jpg ) [ the siemens combino 's serie 13g / c1 / c1a ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/gvb_combino_2008_lijn_10_%2813191733415%29.jpg ) ( c1 : 2001-2130 , 2145-2151 and c1a : 2131-2144 ) [ and the siemens combino 's serie 14g / c2a ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trams_in_amsterdam#/media/file:gvb,_combino_c2a,_2202.jpg ) ( c2a : 2201-2204 ) these are the models that are used in the city ** right now ** , there was a model that was discontinued from usage in 2015 , the [ `` red crosser '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trams_in_amsterdam#/media/file:amsterdamse_tram_-_de_red_crosser_-_from_flickr_2838709455.jpg ) which was really odd in its design as it looks like something pharmaceutical ; it was specifically used for people with disabilities ( and even included a lift ) . 
  the inner design of the trams was changed so that people with disabilities can easily use the * regular * trams with no need for a special one , so the red crosser was discontinued . 
  ** ay yo ma , can i get yo numbah ??? 
  do n't ask me , check for yourself on their website what the criteria is . 
  the cities you named are factually * not * in those regions , and as a result are not counted . 
  should we count maastricht as part of belgium for these sort of statistics merely because it 's close-by ?
