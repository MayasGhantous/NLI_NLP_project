  in that case wallonia is productive as ** fuck ** if we just snatch luxembourg . 
  the question is poorest and/or undervelopped . 
  it 's the same as `` less rich '' , do n't worry . 
  at r/cirkeltrek there are a few !, 
  i 'm a student , and also a tutor for foreign languages , and * very * occasionally i make custom poster commissions . 
  yeah , but it 's way too far away for me . 
  it 's definitely an awesome place for a holiday , but i do n't want to live there ( kinda like paris in that regard ), 
  not a fan of how overly tourist-filled it is all the time , nor how it often feels like there are so many expats that do n't really fully integrate into dutch society seamlessly that it 's harder to integrate . 
  i 'd rather live in a smaller city in the netherlands , where there 's a smaller expat community and less tourists ; and enjoy a more proper dutch experience . 
  nah , not really . 
  me too !, 
  or also maybe the hague . 
  hoping to move there after my studies . 
  i 'm just not made for natural sights and such , cities are really where i feel most at home , and hilversum has so much to give ; it 's really attractive for what i look for in a city . 
   so my point is already proven , as you admit to have found a thing you agree with . 
  but then you decide to make it about an other issue ? 
  i disagree with what the pvv proposed because though they * claim * to want to solve the problem , they do not address it in a way i judge will actually solve it . 
   well this just tells me how out of touch with dutch politics you really are . 
  training facilities are not up to standard . 
  soldiers lack ( training ) equipment . 
  police bureaus have been austerity 'd away . 
  police is heavily underequiped and ( imo ) underpaid . 
  and yet the sk who is heavily in charge of budgeting decisions is often to blame for many of these faults . 
   i 'm talking about the netherlands here ... 
  so am i ? 
   maybe by making laws regarding social housing . 
  maybe by making it part of the national budget . 
  there 's many options , and no solutions specified yet . 
  that does n't seem to stop you from preemptively disagreeing with it though . 
  who the fuck does n't like lower rents , ` until proven otherwise ' of course , duh . 
  so basically no plans ? 
  sounds good . 
   did they say that ? 
  did you just assume that ? 
  yes . 
  we already have quite a lot of sick leave days in case of child illness , i do n't believe we actually need more ; other countries who tried having more and multiple other systems for those easily had employees exploiting it . 
  i do n't want that for the netherlands . 
   do you not see how stupid you sound now . 
  there 's children dying in africa and isis is murdering and raping people , so we might as well stop doing anything here before that 's solved . 
  same logic , same flaw . 
  it 's a sad cop-out . 
  you found something basically everybody , including you , agrees with ? 
  oh no , better try to divert the attention to prevent admitting that i was right and that you found a common opinion with a political party you generally disagree with . 
  i merely believe that in the netherlands it is not an issue that needs more attention than it already has ; our limited free resources should go elsewhere in my opinion . 
   it 's really not that hard . 
  fact that you 're not willing to admit some stupid political parties might have a good point here or there really makes you look more stupid . 
  i can argue with someone about marihuana legalisation and we can both agree that legalising is a good point , but our opinions can differ on the execution . 
  so i * must * agree with them that this and that thing is a problem , even though i disagree with their plans ? 
  i 'm very sorry i do n't like what they propose ; and i still do n't see how me not liking their programme is that big a deal to begin with , i 'll just not vote for them . 
   just because you dislike someone does n't mean anything they do or propose is bad . 
  your attitude is what creates polar rivalries like democrats vs. republicans shitshows . 
  i do n't like liberalism per se but i agree with social liberties . 
  i dislike the trump administration but i agree with the fact that illegals should be treated as illegal . 
  i do n't like socialism but i admire their wish to make society better as a whole . 
  i despise theresa may but i agree with her fashion sense . 
  well there is a * huge * difference between my attitude and us politics general attitudes : i respect that you 'd vote for denk or the pvv if you agree with their programmes as you would for any other party . 
  we 'll agree to disagree and we wo n't be having any name-calling nor bipartisanism . 
  you vote for the parties that represent your interests and ideas best , the pvv and denk missed for me by a ** long ** shot , so i do n't vote for them . 
  that 's the end of the story . 
   i despise theresa may but i agree with her fashion sense . 
  ** ok now i actually ** *** will *** ** fight you to the death **, 
  i did n't come even from the netherlands , and i think that the randstad really is the ideal for me ; public transport is plentiful , i like the vividness of it all ( even if , as you say , it is really loud at times ) . 
  i do n't really think that people from the city are any less nicer than people from the countryside ; both to me seem very nice . 
  fully agreed that tourist season can die in a fire though ; and i live in amsterdam , it 's * always * tourist season . 
  i prefer less tourist-magnet places like utrecht or hilversum . 
  i thought about at max adopting one child , not more . 
  yeah , i like it mainly because it makes me feel like people are more likely to let me know the truth , and not just be polite to my face ; they seem more trustworthy . 
  they will tell me when i 'm wrong so i do n't fuck up again instead of criticizing behind my back , and when they complement you , they usually mean it . 
  i do n't know , though it 's a * very * known thing for us dutchies , a huge stereotype even . 
  i 'm an immigrant to the netherlands , and i have to say that it definitely is true compared to portugal and france , and dutch people are direct and honest as ** fuck ** ( which i actually really like ) . 
   - better care for the elderly . 
  more people directly involved with our elderly though i agree with better care for the elderly i disagree with his plans since it does not provide a solution to a main point : health insurance costs and coverage . 
   - more money for police and defense again , this means more spending from the government , and i believe that our defense and police forces are already strong enough . 
  what really should be done is make sure that the * application * of these funds is in match with the wants and needs of the netherlands , which is a bit of an issue with the sk of the police itself . 
  i 'd rather reform the sk system to allow for a better attribution of funds and priorities rather than just throw money at it . 
   - lower rents how ? 
  by lowering taxes ? 
  if so we should also cut spending in other areas to make up for the money the government no longer generates in these lost taxes . 
  wilders wants to increase spending in other areas as you mentioned ; so let 's play the ever-so-fun debt game !, 
   - more paid leave to take care of sick children yeah with an easily abusable system that was tried in other countries and ultimately crashed and burned . 
   - more effort into relieving child poverty a relevant big problem in the netherlands ? 
   - legal minimum of amount of greenery and playgrounds in neighbourhoods i disagree , i think that infrastructure such as a playground can be perfectly good and safe for children without greenery , and i do n't think it 's the governments ' job to direct what our infrastructure looks like . 
  i 'm fully okay with safety and hygiene standards , but greenery minimums ? 
   - a journalistic oath must be introduced so that basic journalistic principles are protected ** says denk ** . 
  i do not trust that they will ever maintain this , furthermore i think that journalism in the netherlands is * very * good as is and an oath is useless and even contradictory : are people not fully free to say what they want ? 
  wonder why denk would want a `` oath '' of it . 
  i do n't care if you hate it , but the fact is that you can defend what they do such as helping the elderly but i still disagree with the way they go about doing it . 
  we 're a democracy , you vote for who you want to vote as a dutch citizen , so if you are won over by their arguments go right ahead and vote pvv or denk . 
  how come ? 
  tell me what * i * agree with when it comes to the pvv and denk then . 
  go ahead , tell me my own opinion . 
  i dislike things about * every * party , but the pvv and denk are specifically extremely hard to defend in any and all accounts for me . 
  ... we do though : c hold on up to 30 business days for my letter to arrive across the pond ( sorry , sore throat , ca n't shout ) . 
  yep !, 
  love them , especially with some grilled salmon and a light salad . 
  home-made french fries !, 
  i 'm not an arrogant schmick : c ( accurate though , that 's precisely the stereotype , hehe ), 
  yes , but only because by a random chance i live near a family of them . 
  near my house there is a lot of open grassy fields ; and one day there was a stereotypical looking gypsy caravan there . 
  a family of about 7 live in it and i 'm actually wondering where they shower , it 's been there for * months * .
