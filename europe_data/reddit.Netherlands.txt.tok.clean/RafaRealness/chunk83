  i do n't think i 've ever seen them up close , and if i did i did n't notice it was them , but have seem them quite often from afar in their caravan and the little garden they improvised . 
  ** did someone say biking ??? 
  either the [ pvv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_for_freedom ) or [ denk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denk_ ( political_party ) i really can not find * anything * at all about these in particular that i agree with . 
  same here !, 
  i disagree with some of their propositions to reform the way our government works , but agree on pretty much everything else . 
   but it 's so close to the best city in the country though  nowhere near utrecht nor den haag , tsssk . 
  ;p i 'm not a big fan of nature , i like it but do n't wan na live with it , i 'm happy in the randstad . 
  yeah , i agree , and i 'm really hopeful for the future . 
  and yes , india * jfc *, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in1yxtwbhfc ) *, 
  yes , though * to this day * i 'm not sure how to classify them since they do both a lot of good and also a lot of bad . 
  we 'll have to wait and see , and i hope that europe and asia both cooperate nicely and develop green energy technologies further . 
  probably drenthe . 
  it 's too far away from the parts i like of the netherlands , it 's too scarcely populated for my taste , and economically it 's not as good as other regions . 
  that 's for the * netherlands themselves * . 
  for the * kingdom * of the netherlands i 'd say i really do n't wan na live in the caribbean . 
  i 'm happy where i am in europe . 
  yes to which one ? 
  further proof that u/idkfa _ cz is an underrated mod . 
  german efficiency is a myth . 
  i found it to be more bureaucratic and more disorganized than i expected by a long shot ; not as bad as france but still not * that * great . 
  i also expected spanish and italian people to be really loud , and to be fair there is a fair chunk of them that do n't fit this stereotype at all . 
  poles also surprised me by being really sweet and happy , always nice and correct ; none of those brutish `` macho man '' ways that often get stereotyped about them . 
  they also are n't at all just dumb eastern europeans that can only do menial jobs , in my university quite a few of them are even lecturers and researchers ( and they 're pretty good at it too ) . 
  because americans tend to consider themselves irish , dutch , spanish , french , italian , etc. . . to some extent * because * of that ancestry . 
  it is very annoying for someone who does not know your culture , does not speak your language , and does not even have much or any experience with your country to claim ** oh we 're the same !, 
  ** we 're not . 
  it 's perfectly fine , and even interesting , to take an interest on your personal ancestry and get to know where your family came from ; but keep in mind that you are ** not ** your ancestors and you are ** not ** part of our nations lest you actually * come here and integrate fully * . 
  i think it 's very very hard to say actually . 
  i think that due to the massive amount of products they produce for us , trade has been beneficial . 
  financial markets have * somewhat * been better too since the netherlands hosts a bunch of investment firms , and via hong kong there 's been overall good investment opportunities in china . 
  but then again china also pollutes the world to utter shit , even its own capital has its famous fog due to this . 
  with the growing importance of environmental issues , for a country such as the netherlands ( we do n't want floods ) i 'd say that in that domain they have been definitely a liability . 
  i am inclined to say that they have been overall a * small * contributor towards the netherlands , not because they have n't done much , but because not only is what they provide to us questionable ( near-slavery conditions for production ) but there 's also a lot of negative aspects ( sometimes flooding some european markets with cheap knockoffs ) . 
  it can go either way to be honest . 
  well , i 've studied the balkanization of yugoslavia extensively , including the complications and underlying reasons dating back even to * before * yugoslavia existed ... a far better solution regarding serb minorities could have been achieved , and yet was n't by neither side ; war was fought between the two and to this day we pay the price . 
   that would have been apparent if you knew the english idiom `` age well '' and if you realized that there 's a correlation between physical health and physical appearance well , there are people who are very healthy , but ugly . 
   there are so many ways culture and location affect our genetics , that you do n't seem to care to know about since you seem to be so informed , again , why do you ask ? 
  why not be more specific with the type of information you want to know about cultural habits ? 
   well i do n't have all the answers , which is why i 'm the one that asks questions while you 're the one that slams them the problem is that you do n't . 
  at all . 
   i 'm just not very impressed by your explanations i do n't really care to impress you . 
   i 'm not offended of course , i just worry for your general obsession you worry about me ? 
  i never realized i was that important to you . 
  yes , circumstances did n't change * at all * between the formation of yugoslavia and its end . 
  croats made a decision : they did no longer want to be a part of yugoslavia , like slovenia . 
  why should they be forced to stay ? 
   it 's subjective of course , but there are general trends even among subjective opinions  if you like wrinkly skin , that 's your prerogative so your * real * question is `` who are europe 's hottest old ladies '' . 
   populations living for thousands of years in the sun develop differently compared to populations living for thousands of years in the nordic winters me and all my ancestors are from iberia , i live in the netherlands and even passed an entire winter in oulu ... 
  i did n't really need an adaptation period , i just wore the appropriate clothing and that 's it ...  it 's not * that * much better to have any significant effect if you do n't want that explanation , and since you seem to hold all answers , why bother to ask ? 
   do as you like , even continue in this obsessive attack on my character wow , if you think this is an attack , you really must be quite fragile . 
   you do n't have to consider it on the same page , but if your criteria for someone as an ally is a sound approach to the environment , canada is not going to make top of anyone 's list . 
  it does n't matter how much lip service or consolation money they throw at the issue-they are heavily invested in dirty fossil fuels , and support expanding the use of said resources for their own profit . 
  my criteria is not * just * environment , those were mere examples on areas that the netherlands and canada both cooperate far better than the us and hold similar ideas . 
  other areas include social values relating to gay rights ( that i mentioned and you ignored ) , as well as approaches to state welfare policy , migration policy between canada and the eu , health/sanitation/food standards , and trade methods . 
   what i see , truthfully , is someone blinded by the perception more than the reality . 
  you can value commitment to environmentally-friendly policies as much as you like , but there is no credible basis to claim that canada is anywhere near the best partner someone can have on that front canada is n't ( that place would probably go to iceland whose energy is 99,98 % provided by green energy ) the best at all ; though still outranks the us . 
  this is not the * sole end-all-be-all * factor when it comes to better alliances , it is * one of the many factors * that do so . 
  would you like to tell me where the us and the netherlands have more in common regarding social issues , product regulations , trade access , migration deals , etc. . . compared to canada ? 
  the us is a very good ally , but * not * as good as canada , and nowhere near for example belgium , or france , or germany . 
   i did n't say any of those things , they 're just the natural conclusion of what you said . 
  since we ca n't take genetic illnesses into account since , like you said , there 's little correlation between countries , we have to take physical appearance . 
  what 's the metrics for beauty ? 
  and since when is genetics a synonym of physical aptitude ? 
   so greece has all these problems and still lives longer than serbia ? 
  must be genetics and lifestyle responsible , mr. contrarian . 
  you 've understood my sentence entirely backwards . 
  greece has * better * conditions than serbia and most of eastern europe ( exceptions being estonia , poland , czechia , etc. . . the better-off former eastern bloc ) . 
  so , again , not really based on genetics . 
   if that 's what you learned , ok , now would you let others share their opinions ? 
  i 've never stopped anyone from sharing their opinions , anyone 's free to comment on this thread , and by the looks of it they 're as weirded out by it as me . 
   thank you for your `` honesty '' dutch specialty . 
  to all croats : after seeing this thread * now * i understand why you guys wanted independence . 
  / [ s ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/013/604/thisisbait.png ), 
   genetic problems , yes , but some ethnic groups get less wrinkled when they age , their skin less leathery , less blemishes , etc. 
  so you mean * beauty * is the one sole key factor to ageing well ? 
  a gorgeous person in constant agonizing pain and on a wheelchair at age 70 is ** far ** better than a fully healthy and mobile 70 year old capable of even playing competitive sports but happens to be ugly  healthy practices also exist , which is why greeks live longer despite being about as poor as eastern europeans . 
  ... let 's ignore all other infrastructure and health/sanitation standards greece has compared to places like serbia . 
   i 'm asking for people 's experiences , those that have been to many different countries and can assess the appearance of the local population , their diets , culture , etc i 've been to nearly all countries in europe , with notable exceptions in the ex-yugoslav countries and belarus . 
  i can tell you that when it comes to everyday life , there 's not a huge difference , and when it comes to diet though the plates and gastronomy is different from country to country , there are no healthier ones by any metric . 
   because i 'm a guy ? 
  well , i 'll be fully honest , you seem to be just a creep trying to find a woman desperately ; so you asked a quite dumb question and acted a fool online . 
  you seem to have some sort of obsession with genetics too . 
  this does n't really have much to do if you 're a guy or not ; just about your seemingly creepy approach . 
   `` be disrespectful '' , says the dude that uses passive aggressive ellipses , downvotes my comments , fails to use any sort of logic . 
  firstly , i 'd like to quote what i said that was oh so damaging to you , secondly , i did n't even downvote anything from you to begin with . 
   you mean to tell me that health services and diet and culture and genetics have something to do with how much a person lives ? 
  i have mentioned health services * only * because , as you can probably guess , genetic problems happen at a similar rate to any humans around europe , there 's no `` immune race '' here . 
  for diet and culture , again , unhealthy practices universally exist everywhere and there is no way to isolate this or that part as `` better '' since every human responds differently to the same practices . 
   next you 'll tell me that some people age better than others . 
  that 's what i 've been saying since the beginning , while also explaining to you that it is a complex question that can not be isolated to `` these or those women age best '' since * every single human * will have a different response . 
  set a criteria for what you consider `` ageing better '' and compare it to data widely available online , if you want an answer . 
  i still wonder why you 'd like to know which european women age best ; ca n't say it 's not an odd question . 
   dark hair ? 
  that 's cool . 
  no , dark * everything * . 
   also when i saw holland briefly , the people were insanely tall . 
  plenty of brunettes , lots of blondes . 
  everybody was fit . 
  good for you i guess ?
