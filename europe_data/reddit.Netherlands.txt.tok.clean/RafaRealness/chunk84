   dude , i saw this one girl , i 've never seen anything like this in my life . 
  she was about 6 ' 4 , pure blonde , light blue eyes . 
  she made us look like babies !, 
  you saw a very tall blonde girl . 
  good job ? 
  firstly , try to be more respectful . 
  secondly , did you account for health services provided in these countries at all ? 
  sure , russians live a decade less than , say , germans or frenchmen ; but it discounts two very important factors : not all of these people have the same access to the same health services * and * ... ** this map tells you life expectancy , everyone could be in a vegetative state past 60 and as long as we live this long the map would be the same ** is better always longer ? 
  did n't realize aging was so similar to a dick measuring contest . 
   you 're all 6 ' 2 blondes who 're insanely sexy !, 
  you 're talking to a dark iberian dude who 's around 1,70 m. . . ... the dutch are not all blond nor all tall , plus we 're not even nordic . 
  we 're average people who follow dutch culture and customs , that 's basically it . 
  compared to scandies , canadians , and americans , we tend to be * very * direct to the point of sounding rude to foreigners and also stingy . 
  we also are easy to speak to and more honest about what we really think . 
  it 's hard to self-analyze when you 're part of a group to be honest . 
  ask what everyone else thinks about the dutch , they will likely be a better reflection than what i can tell you . 
  so my answer still stands : * the healthy ones * . 
  diet , genetics , and mental temperament are all not exclusive to any ethnic group ; any can have any number of problems related to those . 
  i think a fair question to ask is : why do you think that women from a specific place or ethnic group age differently than others ? 
  and more particularly , what do you count on doing with this type of information ? 
  scandinavians : live really in a world of their own ( not a bad thing btw , just that they stick out as a tightly formed group ) , socially more reserved but still kind and functional , may sometimes get too cocky over their systems or too harshly criticizing themselves . 
  very highly educated usually , and often very well informed . 
  canadians : super kind people ( every once in a while to a creepy level ) , very friendly and easy to have a good conversation with , may not be the best informed about the world , but are usually very open and even eager to learn anything . 
  education is average compared to the netherlands ( a good thing since i think ours is very good ) . 
  maybe culturally they do n't show a lot of elements to contrast themselves from the us . 
  americans : definitely the most extrovert of the group , tend to be * very * friendly ( in a sort of cocky way sometimes ) , particularly loud sometimes , not usually very well informed although * a majority * is open to listen and learn new info . 
  culturally they tend to be very much * american * which is very recognisable , but also to a point that tends to be a bit clich\u00e9 . 
  education-wise it tends to be ** very ** mixed and thus it 's not as seemingly obvious as the others ; there seems to be more variety with americans . 
  keep in mind : this is based on just my personal experiences , and other people may see this very differently . 
  ... the healthy ones ? 
  humans are n't really that simple , we all get old differently even if we 're the same ethnic group . 
  [ *** de vloer is partijkartel *** ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/dcswq2hxgaex4o-.jpg ), 
  turks seem to be one of the more problematic immigrant minorities in the netherlands , alongside with moroccans . 
  i see a turk being one of two categories : a regular joe who happens to be turkish , who speaks dutch and is a fully integrated individual within dutch society , maybe cooks really good food . 
  they are indistinguishable in terms of behavior from other dutchies . 
  then there is the * problematic * turks who do not do efforts to integrate within dutch society , and instead may even form parallel communities ; not to mention that * these * are the ones that make turks one of the heavily overrepresented groups in criminality rates . 
  so being a turk in the netherlands can go either way , and i have no idea if it 's 50/50 or 30/70 or whatever ratio ; i do n't know a lot of turks , so i tend to judge each person ( even non-turks ) individually . 
   pretty much . 
  as much as i like canada , canada 's outsize influence on world affairs is related mostly to it 's close relations with the us/uk . 
  the same can be said for australia , really . 
  not really , i consider * belgium * our best ally , not at all nor canada ( which is still a strong contender ) nor the us . 
  you asked for * best * ally , not strongest . 
   weird criteria for describing someone as an ally . 
  where 's the lie though ? 
  the us is not what it used to be back in the post war period ; nor is the netherlands . 
  though both have very warm ties with each other , the netherlands holds far better ties with others . 
   i do n't think you have a very strong grasp of canada 's environmental policies , if you think this . 
  canada 's prior government went stasi on climate research , virtually gutting it , and even trudeau is ardent supporter of exploiting canada 's oil resources , including approving new pipelines . 
  he 's made intermittent trips to the us to promote canadian energy , in fact . 
  yet you also ignore canadian development of green energy technologies and worldwide investments , such as windfarms in portugal ( co-funded by finland ) . 
  you also ignore that canada 's oil exploitation , though still problematic , is as big as an environmental obstacle as norway 's . 
  canada cooperates with the world ( including europe primarily ) when it comes to environment ; the us does n't engage at all ...  but that 's the power of someone who says one , yet does another , and does n't look terrible while doing it . 
  that 's why you do your own research on what 's being actually done and draw your own conclusions . 
   canada is an energy power on par with the u.s. and even many middle eastern nations ; it is simply not the defender of environmentally-friendly practices that you seem to think it is . 
  well , considering the us likes to pretend global warming is n't a thing nowadays , and does n't really fund * any * green energy projects that i can find , nor even invests on further research on the matter ... 
  i do n't really consider canada and the us to be on the same page on that . 
  i have n't heard of this regulation to be fair . 
  i think that it has to do with the utilization and potential of the bow ( or any other item ) . 
  this would explain why some disabled weapons are fully able to be owned by anyone with no license . 
  depending on the potential the item has . 
  i 'll see if i can find some info on the limitations of the spectre of what a weapon is . 
   of course , another way to work around this is to have a centrally controlled budget for all eurozone states , but adopting your own currency is easier sure , it 's easier , but is it really better ? 
  we 'd lose tonnes of progress made towards a more open and economically sane transactions in europe . 
  price transparency would be gone , speculation would be a huge hassle again within the common market , countries would become * far * less attractive even if both are within the common market due to heightened costs and risks , etc. . . sure , it 's hard to manage and it 's not perfect , but being `` easier '' does n't seem like the best argument . 
  a non-democratic country like north korea has a more efficient decision-making process than the netherlands that does n't even * have * a coalition right now ; so should we aim to be more like north korea for the sake of ease ? 
  i did n't notice any difference in men between utrecht and amsterdam . 
  maybe i should pay more attention , * and find myself someone to put a ring on , goddamnit *, 
  i do n't remember , to be fully honest . 
  i 'm actually just waiting for your explanation . 
  best pun ever . 
  1 and 2 cent coins are being ditched already , for example [ ireland ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/19/ireland-ditch-1-cent-2-cent-coins ) and [ italy ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/italy-to-stop-producing-1-and-2-cent-coins/a-39020206 ) are stopping minting them , so they 'll be gone . 
  explain , with unbiased information . 
  yeah , i know , and information over population management via hunting is included in the hunters ' diploma that is required . 
  i think it 's the best way to go about hunting animals : an informed and highly regulated safe practice that does not negatively impact our fauna . 
  / thread also , to add up on gun ownership and such : bows are considered weapons and , as with all other weapons ( even tasers and such ) you are not allowed to carry them * unless * you are part of the military ( and even then limitations apply ) . 
  gun enthusiasts wishing to carry a weapon must firstly join a recognized gun club ( recognized by the koninklijke nederlandse schutters associatie , royal dutch riflemen 's association ) , where they will face a trial period so the club knows who they are dealing with and also so that they can be screened ( convictions of violence , for example , will immediately disqualify you ) . 
  after * one year * of membership you may purchase * one * gun legally , and after * two * years you may purchase up to 5 guns ; these even with this license , you are required to maintain the weapon and its ammo in two * separate * strongboxes , and the police will check regularly via house calls that your registered weapons are still well within your possession . 
  this does ** not ** permit you to hunt , however . 
  aspiring hunters must educate themselves and pass a hunters ' diploma to prove they are competent and responsible ( also afterwards they must practice often to ensure they do n't provoke any needless suffering to their prey by shooting them and missing somewhat ) ; one of the requirements is also that they have access to hunting grounds ( which is a bit more difficult in some parts of the netherlands that are highly populated like the randstad ) . 
  the netherlands has a ** lot ** of rules as you can see , but they exist for our safety and we feel comfortable with them . 
  so hunting is legal but it requires that any and all hunters pass through rigorous screening and are educated precisely on what they are doing and how to do it . 
  [ english source ] ( https://www.rnw.org/archive/gun-laws-netherlands ), 
  it depends greatly , i 'd say even from person to person . 
  but we all seem to agree that italian men are * very * vain . 
  for portugal , it made it a bit more complicated to be competitive due to the fact that we no longer have control over currency fluctuation . 
  however it also opened up our markets for a * lot * of stimulation by heavily making cooperation with spain and france a ** huge ** non-issue compared to what it was before ; and it also made our tourism industry develop significantly faster . 
  for the netherlands , it also gave us a mean to oddly enough have more of a say over currency exchange because before the deutschmark was too powerful and was entirely dominating and forcing the guilder into following it . 
  this way we actually get a say in these matters ; plus we also avoid currency exchange risks that already screwed over dutch companies in the past ( look at fokker for example , and yes that 's their name ) . 
  i still , however , believe that the euro is incomplete and provokes issues since there is no harmonization of debts nor common budget policy ; furthermore since there is no one ruler of the currency yet very different countries using it , in a time of crisis there was absolutely * no * last-resort lender ( the european central bank was prohibited by its own design from playing such a role ) and no shock-absorbing system in place due to the euro . 
  so although the euro is great when everything is up and running , it 's a nightmare when anything crashes . 
  the euro is a very good project , but it ** must ** be completed in order for it to ever fully work seamlessly ; and since 2008 , a lot of the necessary steps have slowly started taking place . 
  true , it 's kinda hard * not * to find beautiful women in europe , if you look for them . 
  stereotypically * everywhere * in europe has sexy women . 
  for some reason the stereotype of sexy men is * far * more exclusive . 
  politically the us has supported a dictatorship in portugal , and tried to drag france into needless war ( as if it needed any help ) . 
  i think * politically * the us has been a bit of a nuisance overall , even accounting for the * good * things its done such as helping in ww2 or nato and such ; but economically it definitely has been of great benefit to france ( and the netherlands too ) but that bullshit in 2007 ... yeah 10 years later portugal 's economy is still recovering ... culturally , well , i think it 's just neutral . 
  i love american tv shows , and i really like some arts from there as well , and some technology and research etc. . . 
  though i also think that sometimes it 's a bit too big of an influence force ; though not by the us 's fault . 
  so culturally i think it 's mainly neutral . 
   that 's great , then !,
