  the same for me . 
  i can take some nice jokes about my culture and country . 
  but black people ca n't say the same . 
  historically , when they 're are stereotyped because they skin , hair , physical complexion ... it has been made to degrade them and make them feel `` less '' . 
  they were n't even able to represent themselves in theather and movies so a white person had to paint himself to represent them , always with the purpose of mocking them . 
  same for my ethnicity though ... 
  i mean , that sounds like the same for everyone too ; hell , my ancestors were even specifically hunted and killed . 
  times changed and now there 's no problem with me being me or anyone being black . 
   said that , and i insist i ca n't judge about `` zwarte piet '' , i understand why they can feel uncomfortable about it , the same i can understand why they can feel uncomfortable about capirotes ) . 
  of course you can debate if the character is black because race or other things , but the full concept , at the first glance , `` seems wrong '' because the black facing tradition . 
  so because * one * per cent feel uncomfortable the other 99 % should quit doing it ? 
  or instead could the uncomfortable parties merely not participate in the tradition and leave it alone ? 
  i do n't feel comfortable at all drinking alcohol or being in clubs , so why should anyone else do it ? 
   my point is that when something does n't impact your life or your community , it is ok !, 
  from the moment someone or some collective tells you they feel offended or mistreated , maybe you should listen to them ... 
  if they feel offended i 'll hear it , but if they are literally calling to ban a dutch tradition with no basis other than `` we do n't like it ! '', 
  then i wo n't pay them much mind ; they are n't being any better than denk . 
  i could claim that the spanish anthem glorifies a king taught by franco and if i had an ancestor from those times , i was offended . 
  should spain change its anthem then ? 
  because of a small teeny tiny crybaby minority ? 
  i can only distinguish between americans , australians , brits , and * sometimes * irishmen . 
  i can somewhat hear something odd or off about canadians , but i usually guess they are from some other region of the us . 
  new zealanders and aussies i do n't know the distinction , for the brits i can make an educated guess if you 're english/welsh or otherwise ( scotsmen and northern irishmen have a distinct accent ) . 
  does this mean that it 's our * best * one for the specific case of the netherlands ? 
  whereas the netherlands and canada were the first countries to take the first step into legalizing gay rights , the us has a president who 's flipping on the issue , used a tragedy for popular votes , and has a vice president who defends shock therapy . 
  not to mention , the us does little to nothing in regards to the environment , which is a ** very ** important topic for the netherlands considering that a big chunk of our country exists under the sea . 
  meanwhile , canada cooperates with us on a very close basis on this matter . 
  i am so turned on by this . 
  * oh baby whisper dirty czech to me *, 
  * precisely my point . 
  * the us ( well , canada ) took us out of the nazi occupation , but they also dragged us to their side of the cold war ; and supported dictatorships in spain and portugal . 
  i do n't see them as benevolent at all ; they served their interests . 
  i am very grateful that they have helped our continent regain its freedom and get away from the claws of nazism , but i can not say that they are our biggest ally when ( afterwards ) our interests have clashed quite severely in the past ; and when we have allies like canada who * do * still stand by our side and our interests more often than not . 
  times have changed , so has the netherlands , and so has the us . 
  i 'm happy we 're still overall friendly towards each other but i do n't see them as a very big ally ( hell , the uk is a bigger ally even with brexit ) . 
  it has no impact in my life , if anything it 's got a slightly positive one because i heard some jokes i genuinely laughed about my ethnicity , and it made me feel welcome because my ethnicity though it was visible and people felt free to mention it if needed , i was n't treated like anything extraordinary . 
  the zwarte piet debate has been hijacked by nutty people who want to actively censor and ban parts of dutch culture and artworks ; the same kinds of people who cry about comedians saying jokes about them . 
  the point of the character is not at all to mock nor marginalize nor do anything towards anyone black , its whole purpose is just a funny christmas-esque tradition for anyone to enjoy should they want to . 
  my bed doubles as a really big couch , and i also have enough space for a table with 3 chairs , so there 's more than enough space for guests to drop by . 
   here in the usa [ baby ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-enjcgv1o ), 
  my apartment is 13m \u00b2 and i live alone . 
  i love my teeny tiny apartment , rent is cheap and it 's easy to clean , plus it 's still big enough to have a guest or two . 
   jokes aside , look for the swiss flag flair , there are a number of them roaming around here . 
  i 'm in switzerland for about 9 hours a day , 5 days per week , so i partially fit the description myself . 
  * brb paging a mod to get you partially banned *, 
  5 generations back , everyone lived/was born in portugal ( some left , me included ) . 
  alright , you 're right . 
  well , the original question did n't mention the netherlands , it talked about the european union ... 
  i 'm portuguese . 
  ** help . 
  ... so should anyone in the former eastern bloc be eternally grateful towards the ex-ussr ? 
  including estonia , latvia and lithuania that basically were swallowed up by it ? 
  if ww2 alliances are the end-all-be-all of our alliances , why are we even * lightly * cooperating with germany ? 
  but why the usa ? 
  i agree with canada , not because they freed us ( but definitely is a bonus ) but because they defend a lot of the same values our country does and cooperates with us a * lot * . 
  the us does n't always defend our values , and often even goes against them , and our best interest , so i do n't see them as a very big ally compared to other , more cooperative and constructive relationships we have with other countries . 
  i 'd like to see less dependency on us defense , that 's for sure . 
  trump 's election has n't changed much , aside that i 'd hesitate more in terms of ** cooperation ** ( not dependency ) on the usa regarding security . 
  i think we should be partners and have a constructive and cordial relationship where one is not above the other ; but still maintain enough a distance to be independent should we disagree and live well off without the other 's help in that domain . 
   usa as our ( dutch ) biggest ally . 
  why are they our biggest ally ? 
  compared to others like canada , belgium , etc. . . 
  that 's odd , everyone i know who has a private health insurance ( a requirement to work in the netherlands even ) says it 's covered . 
  i grew up in two republics with no monarchs . 
  only recently did i ever have a king . 
  i really like the royal family , they seem like a very kind and happy family publicly . 
  they also are an important part of dutch culture and history . 
  one thing in particular i really appreciate about them is that they do n't seem to take themselves way too seriously like queen lizzie , instead they seem to be happy respectful royals who do n't take it too far ( for example , our king dabbed as a joke once ) . 
  cinema sins : * ding !, 
  dutch people get their teeth checked usually every 6 months . 
  sometimes the dentist may tell you you do n't need to come for a whole year ; or sometimes you genuinely just go every year . 
  a checkup is around 20 $ , and thanks to our insurance system , it 's often fully reimbursed . 
  ** annex belgium ** in all seriousness there is n't really any movements that i 've heard of , and if there is they 'd be extremely fringe . 
  sure there were attempts at annexing parts of germany after ww2 , and flanders should totes join us / s but nothing really serious . 
  so when i get told that i look like a piece of beef jerky , that 's racism and i should whine and cry about it ? 
  zwarte piet is a character , in the books i 've read that include him he 's black because he 's the first one down the chimney . 
  he may or may no be black and honestly does it truly matter ? 
  die antwoord had multiple occasions where they dressed similarly , and nobody said anything . 
  in portugal we have a very unknown but still existent brazilian character that looks 100 % like a female zwarte piet called a bahiana , etc. . . none are accused of racism , just zwarte piet by the same crowds that want to ban parts of dutch culture instead of leaving practices to evolve ( or * devolve * as the case may be ) freely . 
  [ oh daddy , the sexiest slovak man ] ( https://m.smedata.sk/api-media/media/image/spectator/7/25/2558827/2558827_1200x.jpeg?rev=3 ), 
  i 'm portuguese and i think that my country is pretty awesome to live in , but there are definitely drawbacks : firstly , we tend to have quite a few natural occurring incidents in some areas , including forest fires ( as you 've probably recently saw ) every summer , or ( mainly in the archipelagos ) dirt slides . 
  another problem i 'd say is the economic situation . 
  although we 're now having a very good recovery , there is absolutely no pretending that our situation is `` good '' . 
  jobs are still scarce ( and unemployment statistics only look better because * they changed who counts as unemployed * ) and this is very apparent as younger people decide to fully move abroad asap . 
  another problem i 'd say is tax evasion and corruption . 
  we 've had multiple recent scandals concerning , for example , our former prime minister , or casa p\u00eda , all with tonnes of really severe accusations and such . 
  basically if you move to portugal 's bigger cities , and have a decent life without taking a big interest in politics , it 's an * amazing * place to live . 
  but * do * keep in mind these main three problems . 
  friendzoned again / s also oh my god i forgot about that amazing song . 
  every penis is unique to be fair , so i think that in this case it highly depends on the person and the sensitivity of that person 's dick . 
  ... are * you * an interested dude though ? 
  probably czechoslovakia . 
  i am hugely interested in the communist history of it , and i also think that the dubcek years were significantly better than others , `` socialism with a human face '' brought more openness to the table ; even if the ussr then had to be a cunt and roll it back . 
  i always use protection , it 's been a * huge * topic when i was younger ( just before puberty age ) and i consider it a vital point that i and my partner are both protected . 
  also , my meat 's proudly uncut , condoms do n't make much difference in my case ; there 's a lightly noticeable difference in intensity but it 's way worth it in my opinion . 
   my slutty bff if he 's a dude , can i get a number ? 
  i kinda see you guys as just poor sods that were victims of colonial genocide . 
  i have n't ever met one in real life , but i think i 've seen my share of them in medias . 
  you seem to be basically be people who happen to have an extra native american culture and that 's basically it . 
  stereotypically i do n't know why but i always think about sexy tanned native american men with long luscious hair ** or ** casino owners or oil-extraction directions who are rich beyond belief .
