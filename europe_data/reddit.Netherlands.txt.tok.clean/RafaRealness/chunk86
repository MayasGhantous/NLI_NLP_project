  i have no idea where the stereotype 's from but ... basically . 
   freedom is fine until you hurt people , it would n't impact many children who celebrate it , so why not give the people that are hurt by it this ? 
  so we 're going full-on tumblr and the netherlands needs to be a shitty safe-space ? 
  how about ** no . 
  ** i am free and so is everyone else to express themselves , to joke about what they want to joke about , if you do n't like it then do n't join . 
  i 'm not going to force a belgian to hear my jokes about them nor kick his ass because he 's belgian . 
  if he does n't like it then do n't listen to me , easy as that . 
   well there was that protest cause there were n't enough black people at the oscars . 
  there were also protests against equal rights for black people in america . 
  i do n't judge protests a good metric for much . 
   who decides is racism are the people negatively impacted by it . 
  i 've been joked about because of my race and my origins , does it mean i get to ban everyone from ever doing that shit again ? 
  or do i get to be a grownup and get over it ? 
  ... * no shit norway *, 
   well , there 's racial diversity that is true and then there 's idiotic stereotypes like the big earrings and full red lips . 
  so we should entirely dismantle and ban stereotypes then ? 
  who decides what 's a stereotype to begin with ? 
  should we also shun every single comedian for making fun of any sort of racial difference ? 
  when someone jokes about my race i do n't get offended i just laugh with them , it 's a damn * joke * . 
   not necessarily , but it would be if it 's the only black guy in the movie : basically every black guy is statically a criminal . 
  so now statistically we need to fully represent every single minority as both good and bad ? 
  by what percentage ? 
  and should we ban movies where the only black guy in it is the bad guy or is an idiot ? 
  i can pretty much think of tonnes of them already ... say goodbye to * all * those movies about the vietnamese wars because statistically all the bad guys are asian !, 
   it does have impact , black people are being approached by toddlers thinking they 're zwarte piet , imagine being compared to a clown . 
  we remember things in the back of our head . 
  i was approached by toddlers who thought i was dora 's cousin diego , and a while back two of them also thought i was one of the bad guys from noddy . . 
  they are kids , and honestly nobody gives a fuck . 
  if a grown up starts discriminating against me because of my race then sure , * then * we 'll have a problem , but not when ** silly kids are literally just being kids ** . 
   i wo n't and i 'm glad more cities do n't . 
  that 's your own decision and opinion , so why not let people celebrate what they want without being a preachy social justice warrior who literally talks about * racial statistics in movies * ? 
  the netherlands is a place that upholds personal freedoms and even historically fought over to defend its culture and right to express and evolve it as society saw fit . 
  to claim that minorities need special treatment and that we should forcefully stop others from practices that do n't affect them seems to me like you want to * limit * personal freedoms and want to instead go back to a society with even more barriers and limits , more tensions between individuals . 
  * the great nation of san escobar * / s, 
  by that standard what * is n't * racism that includes * any * racial diversity at all ? 
  if in a movie , the bad guy is black , is it also unintentional racism ? 
  this is a silly kids tradition with no value nor impact , merely a small element of dutch celebratory culture . 
  do n't like it ? 
  do n't practice it ; simple as that . 
  is it intended as racism ** nowadays ** though ? 
  i mean , should we destroy all traditions even * remotely * offensive ? 
  let 's tell norwegians that their nynorsk can fuck off since it was a way to remove foreign influence from their language . 
  what i am saying is that zwarte piet , as is today , is ** a silly shitty kids tradition ** and the debate that was sparked even called for ** banning ** it . 
  in a modern non-racist society , it should change absolutely nothing that he 's black , or that sinterklaas is white , hell , i 've seen an asian dude play zwarte piet last year and it was great fun , so we 're beyond race . 
  saying that `` oh but muh origins its sooo offensive ! '', 
  is needless whining from people who really could be productive but are n't . 
  it 's the same kid of people who give portuguese people shit for having a monument for its discovery ages . 
  again , ** in the modern day ** does zwarte piet * still * remain an outrageous racist symbol ? 
  no , absolutely not , it 's moved beyond that just like danes do n't * seriously * believe the `` witches '' they send to germany each year are actually magic . 
  norway showing nordic kids is nazi then ? 
  but ... that 's how they look ? 
  i can vote in the * national portuguese * elections as well as the french ones due to my citizenship ( not the dutch ones ) , i can also vote in the * municipal * elections in amsterdam due to my residency . 
  you 're right but goddamn , negerinnentetten is just the best name i 've heard for them ever . 
  care for some negress titties ? '', 
  you do n't know what `` immigrating '' means then . 
  i 've already immigrated , i 'm already here , and there is * no * law that forces me to ever become a dutch citizen at all . 
  in huge damn letters : ** r\u00c9publica portuguesa , uni\u00c3o europeia **, 
  [ negro clothing ? 
  ] ( https://steefschrijft.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/media_xll_2535612.jpg ) to me he seems dressed like a clown or a jester ( which makes sense since he plays tricks on naughty kids ) which also explains why he 's got lipstick on . 
  as for the earrings , he 's supposed to be somehow minted , like sinterklaas , according to the books i read about him . 
  if zwarte piet is a racist icon for bright red lips and big earrings , then i fear for every single drag queen . 
  * so what about the ones who do not have citizenship yet still come to our countries and live here ? 
  * statistically , once you get citizenship , you 're counted as a citizen , not a foreigner . 
  you can still live here if you * do n't * have a citizenship , just do so legally . 
  paperwork for citizenship takes ** years ** to achieve , immigration took me about 7 working days to fully manage . 
  i am a resident of the netherlands who works and studies like everyone else , i just do n't have a citizenship . 
  i 'm an immigrant , not a citizen . 
  i feel like it 's not the safest place to go , and i 'm sure as hell not gon na go to most of it . 
  i want to go to israel , since that seems the most developed and safest part to visit for me , and i 'm not really more afraid of going , just that i ca n't really afford it right now and i 've got other cities higher in my list of places i wan na go to . 
  white children = aryan race propaganda ? 
   negerinnentetten i ca n't stop laughing * help *, 
  i moved to the netherlands and i am still franco-portuguese , not dutch . 
  i am * an immigrant * with residency and work rights ( eu has that covered , for non-eu migration you need a residency visa and a working permit ) . 
  if i want the dutch nationality ( or the danish one for that matter ) i must go through another process that in all countries is usually `` live here for a while , integrate fully , and then we 'll see '' . 
  also , some immigrants do the paperwork on arrival ( as is the case for eu citizens , or asylum seekers ), 
  a black man from spain named piet who dresses as a dutch jester . 
  the multicultural agenda !, 
  / s i still think that the story that he comes down the chimney first and is black with messy hair due to the coal and gunk all in the chimney is more plausible than `` oh he 's * black * ! '', 
  and honestly the whole debate always seemed hella off to me : is it not easier to just * not * celebrate the tradition with zwarte piet if you disagree with it ? 
  why did some toss pots had to make a shite political attempt at it ? 
  i mean , i personally really love that salad , so feel free to give me some if you do n't want it . 
   because when they immigrate here , they just get a new nationality ( or in some cases an extra ) , what they were before matters not . 
  if they were guatamalan or japanese , south african or from new zealand . 
  that is an utter lie . 
  there are immigrants who come to the netherlands ( like myself ) and there is no instantaneous new nationality , you must reside here for a minimum of 5 years and demonstrate that you speak dutch as well as follow dutch civic conventions . 
  you are * not * just dutch when you arrive , what the heck ? 
   why would it be important ? 
  they come here to live and work , take part in our society . 
  then they can be swiss or cuban for all that matters . 
  because there are genuine statistics , for example in the netherlands , that make you think : both turks and moroccans are * heavily * overrepresented in prisons , and the reason is n't discrimination , it 's just that these minorities * do * tend to be more criminally active than , say , the south american , or polish minorities . 
  so we should keep track of how many immigrate here each year and debate over the allowed number of immigrants from each non-eu place . 
   make mayo salad ( \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442 \u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044c\u0435 i 'm guessing ? ), 
   watch glorious films from \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 times  get smashed on cheap `` classy '' alcohol yep , you have definitely integrated with the ways of the \u043c\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0433l\u0430\u0438\u0434, 
  i did n't even know he * was * from spain . 
  and again , are there no black spanish people then ? 
  for me it sounds * far * more racist to say `` this character * can not * ever be this race '' than to just leave it be as is . 
  oh god are you saying that there is even the teeny tiniest chance that the terminator was * hatched * ? 
  * as an inhabitant of an egg ? 
  not really offensive anywhere i 've been , just really an adjective to describe someone who 's got a mixed ethnicity . 
  hell , one of your most famous people is called ** schwarzenegger ** ( in dutch negger = * that * word ),
