  * bruh * . 
  i 'm gay , can confirm that my sexual orientation is hella sexist since it excludes me from women . 
  i think that the zwarte piet debate was really just a demonstration of how gullible and contradictory they can be under the right the right arguments . 
  i wear my flip flops , or walk around with the nakedest feet ever ( wow , so naked , so bare ) . 
  nah son , being mediterranean looking is n't bad at all in the netherlands , sometimes it helps me get some dick . 
  ca n't complain about it at all . 
  i live in amsterdam , please stop sending your hooligans here . 
  again , what * if * he 's black even ? 
  why ca n't he be black to begin with ? 
  do we need to pretend that black dutch people named `` piet '' do n't exist or something ? 
  he just seemed like a dirty silly dude who came down the chimney , hence why his skin is black , and his hair is fucked , plus he 's a jester so he has clown lips ... ( he literally plays a trick on kids and is dressed like a king 's joker ) ** why is a silly tradition even the object of racism ? 
  nah , not really , i went through the usual `` oh i wish i was ___ '' phase when i was younger when i wished i was whiter , or asian , or something else ; but i do n't think i 've ever really hated my ethnicity at all . 
  should we mention zwarte piet ? 
  not sure he counts as * a product * but he sure as fuck sparked stupid controversies . 
  for those who do n't know : we have a character who 's fully black ; however in my innocent damn mind i thought he was black because * he 's the first down the fucking chimney * but nope !, 
  racism for some people . 
  * you 're just jealous of our sexxy sexxy urban cities and multicultural skyscrapers * / s, 
  ... who the fuck are you ? 
  are you that `` chechnya '' i keep hearing about ? 
  wait no , you 're poland right ? 
  i 'm a foreigner , my name is hella portuguese . 
  in portugal my name is pretty rare , i 've never met another person with it . 
  it 's a very common * first * name but as a last name i have yet to see another person with it . 
   8/10 , because it 's far from standard to learn czech even for people who 've lived here for years . 
  mostly looking at you , people from the anglosphere . 
  yeah i know it 's hard . 
  life is hard . 
  i wanted to learn czech in my uni but i was the only one who chose it so i had to switch to russian instead ( coming back to czech later tho ), 
  * try me , i am ready *, 
  i 'd probably manage to save around 1,900 $ ~ 2,100 $ . 
  i * could * save it but i 'd likely just expand my budget a bit more and get more stuff , still , saving * at the bare minimum * 1,000 $, 
  oliven\u00e7a is portuguese catalonia deserves independence franco was alright spain is the mexico of europe barcelona is your capital tapas are better in america sangria is just a fruity cocktail everyone there is a latino chorizo is overrated paella is disgusting ** i 'm actively trying **, 
  quite commonish in portugal , not so much in france nor in the netherlands , though renting houses * just * for the holidays is definitely something growing . 
  hey , fake or not , they 're tasty little fuckers ( as i 've heard , never had one yet ) . 
  they 're * tastefully * fake , like well done breast implants . 
  my portuguese side ** extremely ** wants to put that to the test . 
  well , there are multiple `` chocolates '' that are not really real chocolate , but rather contain substances that replace the original ones . 
  not before i water torture him in a canal until he begs me for the sweet release of a slow death . 
  that is very true , social skills also are a key factor in a child 's education ; and i really do n't see a way for this to be introduced to homeschooling education ; unless maybe by taking different activities such as sports or crafts to socialize more ; but it still is no match for an actual school experience . 
  it 's french , chocoiat is supposed to be chocolat , and enrobees is enrob\u00e9es , it says : `` mint slices/rings coated in real chocolate '', 
  i can barely handle 4 shots of vodka , i am the lightest weight probably . 
  i will probably ** die ** . 
  i 'm triggered oh my god * no . 
  *** reeeeeeeeeeeeee ***, 
  canada is still ** veeeeerrry ** close to the netherlands , so it 's definitely reciprocal . 
  you 're basically the chill dudes who freed us and defend a lot of the same values we do . 
  nl loves belgium , but nl got looots of love to give , do n't worry . 
  sometimes the right price is 0.00 $ ' ,  besides , i 'm not paying for the blowjob , i 'm paying for the * whole czech experience * ( this way you do n't get sued ! ), 
  i prefer just asking first , so i do n't seem forceful . 
  * i will break you in ways you did not consider possible *, 
  true , though since i live here i kinda politely ask to keep speaking dutch , so i can practice it and stop sucking at it . 
  yes , yes it does . 
  ** however ** there is also a call-centre and an online system ( that is utter shite but still , it 's existent ) where you can ask specific questions to actual cned teachers . 
  it 's not great , and the point of the cned is to mainly reach kids with subjects they are unable to take at school ( i , for example , had italian and english at the same exact time in my school , so i took italian via cned so i could take the classes without missing anything ) . 
  * good , that 's precisely what i need for my gay fantasy holidays * ** ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) **, 
  if i visit estonia , and try to speak finnish , how far would i go ? 
  also , is speaking * very very * broken estonian welcome there ? 
  and some anti-vaxxers say that vaccines are turning our kids autistic , and that fat guy from info wars says that obama dumped chemicals in the water and turned the frogs gay . 
  they can say whatever they want , but i 'll need solid and concrete evidence of their claims before i treat wild claims with any sort of respect . 
   insisting czechs are all in fact somehow involved in pornography well not in * pornography * but for the right price czechs go down on you ... right ? 
  * the internet would n't lie to me about free blowjobs , would it ? 
  ** i will drown your fucking schnitzels in sauce , you goddamn conchita german ** / s, 
  in france , there is the cned : your child gets given all the books , exams , and materials for the year in the subject ( s ) he/she takes at home . 
  it is your job as a parent ( or their actual own responsibility in my case ) to teach them the material as instructed in the books ( but you 'll be as lost as them so you 're just reading it to them so yeah ) . 
  annually you 'll need to do a minimum of exams in order to pass as you would high school , and if you want your baccalaur\u00e9at ( the high school diploma ) you must pass the exam just like every other student in france . 
  our schools tend to be * much * less biased than the us ( from what i can see ) when it comes to `` indoctrination '' . 
  yes there definitely is a bias that is visible to be favorable towards the country , but we do n't have a damn * pledge of allegiance * thing going on , and in a * lot * of cases , schools openly criticize the country . 
  i 'd say schools indoctrinate a * teeny * bit that is safe and merely there mainly due to nationalistic reasons ( it 's normal in my opinion ) , however the alternative to that is homeschooling , where * literally anything goes * . 
  there is no supervision , i can teach my kid that the quran is the holy book and he should blow himself to smitterines in zaventem for 72 virgins and whatnot . 
  i could teach him all sorts of crazy and dangerous things , who is going to stop me from educating him to be a full-on neo-nazi ? 
  whereas schools in europe * do * have a small indoctrination effect ; i 'd * always * prefer it over taking any chances with homeschooling . 
  ** keep in mind : ** i am not referring to places like russia or turkey where facts are near illegal to even speak of ; i am talking about mainly educational standards in western europe ( not sure how good it is in the rest of eastern europe ) . 
  plato wrote it , originally as an allegory , and it got passed down from generation to generation . 
  it 's as charming as the communist manifesto in that regard . 
  talk to us about weed or prostitutes . 
  ** i fucking dare you **, 
  i believe it should be illegal * unless * the caregiver has proven to the state that he/she is fit to educate a child according to the dutch education programme . 
  i * really * do n't like the idea of homeschooling at all , though i believe that * in very rare instances * where the father/mother definitely has the capability to provide a sane and complete education to their child , * perhaps * there should be a way . 
  * we can make the pain go away , just give us wallonia back *, 
  sole thing i do is very rarely smoke some weed with friends , but that 's about it . 
  nope . 
  sure , they should be tolerated and such , but that does n't mean you deserve any bit of respect for your opinion . 
  also :  let 's also exclude factually incorrect or racist opinions . 
   i try to respect everyone , even trump supporters well , you respect factually incorrect and racist opinions if you respect trump supporters then . 
  ** cocaine ** florida man lots of clubs beautiful beaches sexy ( but often plastic ) people 80s style neon everything pink ( lots of it ) shootouts . 
  that 's basically it . 
  [ well , it 's one in english ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/be-miles-away ), 
  i do n't drink ( not because i 'm religious , i just do n't like alcohol ) and basically it 's treated as normal , just a bit surprising . 
  they 're usually just normal to me , i go with them to bars but order some water or some iced tea instead ; and on occasion help out someone who 's too drunk and needs help getting home . 
  depends on how it 's said . 
  if someone just says `` oy twat ! '', 
  and he just wants my attention it 's one thing ; if someone 's trying to actively be a cunt about it ( hehehe ) and be offensive then i 'll take it as an insult . 
  when it comes to cursing i always take the words for their context and express meaning rather than for what they literally mean . 
  as long as they are n't full-on extremists ( looking at you , pvv ) , we tend to be fully friends . 
  yeah we argue when we talk about politics , but then when the subject changes we just drink a beer and it 's as if there was no argument . 
  i moved from portugal to france , and from france to the netherlands . 
  primarily i moved for education ( high school in france       portugal 's low educational system , and i wanted to attend uni in the netherlands because the french unis are too elitist and francocentric for what i wanted to study ) . 
  i decided to * stay * in the netherlands afterwards because i just feel at home here , and love living here ; not because of the money but for the general dutch way of going about doing things , like being more direct , or more practical about your problems , less faff about everything . 
  because you can also have tickets that do not need constant validation ... there are monthly tickets you validate once and that 's it , others are daily , others are weekly , etc. . . sooo are you referring to something else ? 
  it was just some banter , just an empty threat really ; but the fact that it was so damn savage ... goddamn .
