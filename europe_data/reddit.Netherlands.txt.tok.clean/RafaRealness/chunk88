  huh , til . 
  the world 's biggest reset button ^ / s, 
  it reminds me of the most menacing thing i 've ever heard , between a belgian and a luxembourger , the belgian said to him : ** you better watch out little guy , or the benelux might just become ... bene ** to this day i 'm shook . 
  i 'm not even dutch , i just love the everlasting crap out of the netherlands and live here . 
  you 're the best zuid brabant , could n't ask for a better province < 3, 
  hands-down we can always count on our good ol' friend belgium . 
  sure neither of us are big and strong , but they really are the closest ally we 've got i think . 
  and less rich , with guns . 
  same as every place on earth : self-obsessed , stupid , loud , unruly , fat , racist , basic , guns galore , nationalistic to a ridiculous point ... trump without the money but with guns and a bigger belly . 
  who would say no to swallowing a sexy czech ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  maybe spain , with the whole catalan question ? 
  also i really wish that portugal and spain would both stop having a pissing contest , just host a fucking referendum in olivenza/oliven \u00e7a , and respect the damn result ( seriously it 's sad at this point ) . 
  the uk * might * see some changes with northern ireland , but i have no clue as to how likely that is , just that it 's still on the table . 
  maybe there will be further border changes between russia and ukraine & georgia , with the whole issues they are having ; not sure how it 'll evolve . 
  recently we had a deal with belgium to redraw the border a teeny tiny bit so that this small area of land could be covered by the police better , so there can be other cases like that between very cooperative countries ( heard finland and sweden did something like that for a lighthouse ), 
  ... it was n't ? 
  ** who the fuck is it then !? 
  i feel like every 3rd czech person i see sooorta misses slovakia . 
  i wonder how [ `` baby come back '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-enjcgv1o ) would sound in czech/slovak, 
  true , some borders follow merely zones nobody really wants to live in . 
  italy 's borders are really interesting because they really seem like they were * meant * to be there somehow , the peninsula just is outlined with mountains , it 's kinda cute . 
  i said that the benelux is a bit of a peculiar case , i mean , look at our border : we got tonnes of small towns all tangled up in there , mainly because we 've kept it open . 
  other borders who have been historically ** far ** more closed down have way less inhabitants near or on them . 
  if you want to go through the ** naturalization ** process , you * must * renounce any and all other citizenships you may have , including your american citizenship . 
  this process , however , does n't apply to you since you 've never even * lived * in germany . 
  instead you go through the descendent process , which is open for the following : - those born after 1 january 1975 are germans if the mother or father is a german citizen . 
  - those born before 1 january 1975 could normally only claim german citizenship from the father and not the mother . 
  exceptions included cases where the parents were unmarried ( in which case german mothers could pass on citizenship ) or where the german mother applied for the child to be registered as german on or before 31 december 1977 . 
  - special rules exist for those born before 1 july 1993 if only the father is german and is not married to the mother . 
  the father must acknowledge paternity and must have married the mother before 1 july 1998 . 
  - a child born in a foreign country will no longer receive german citizenship automatically by birth , if his/her german parent was born after 31 december 1999 in a foreign country and has his/her primary residence there . 
  ( exceptions apply ) . 
  - in case both parents are german citizens , german citizenship will not be passed on automatically , if both parents were born abroad after 31 december 1999 and have their primary residence outside of germany . 
  exceptions are same as the above . 
  - those born in germany and adopted to a foreign country would need to contact their local german consulate for clarification of german citizenship . 
  so if your father ** right now ** is still a german citizen , and you are under 23 years of age ; you can apply via this method . 
  i 've very often have been mistaken by other slavic people due to how oddly close portuguese sounds to those languages ; plus it goes both ways , russian seems to be far easier to me than for my english , french , or italian colleagues . 
  yes that 's very true , though i still think that is n't a determent to current warm relationship with them . 
  their government wo n't last forever so i do n't think it 's even an option to burn our bridges . 
  the netherlands maintains good relationships with their former colonies , like suriname and indonesia . 
  there 's a cooperative investigation between the netherlands and indonesia to fully explore the violence that happened between the two during the war for independence ; and i 'm very happy that both sides show mutual respect and want a mutually beneficial relationship . 
  there are a * lot * of immigrants from indonesia and suriname , especially where i live , and the primary stereotype is a bit foggy but seems to be the same for both : very hardworking , a bit less educated , very friendly , have good food . 
  generally a positive stereotype . 
  not all colonies , however , have maintained such a relationship . 
  we 're still on good terms , but taiwan and the netherlands are n't really that close . 
  yep , that 's true , i think spanish is somewhat more spoken , i lived near the border in that edge of portugal that seems to point to valladolid . 
  i wonder if it 's harder for a spanish native speaker to learn portuguese than vice versa , because of portuguese 's higher number of sounds , and different article/preposition relationships . 
  i meant religious as in the extent that religion has a place in societal matters ( as well as , additionally , government matters ) . 
  from what i can tell , this conservative side stems culturally from religion initially , and remained so ; thus meaning that religion indirectly still has an influence over social morals . 
  at a more serious reply i 'd probably say scandinavia ; the northern heathens sure love getting low n sexy as it seems . 
  czechia seems a bit open to it all , and it happens to be a huge porn producing powerhouse . 
  i have no idea where the idea that italy , a pretty religious country , is the most open for sex came from ; from experience that 's the opposite . 
  the most sexually open people i 've met in europe are either the scandies or the czechs . 
  well , looking at how populated borders are compared to their more internal counterparts , there definitely is a general difference . 
  sure there are places like strasbourg , or bratislava that * are * very big and close to the border , but borders tend to remain still quite underhabitated in general . 
  the benelux may be a bit of an exception , but i 'd argue that we 've been bundled together for so long we ca n't really define it so easily . 
  if you look at the french borders , you will see that the closer you get to the border with belgium , there is less and less people past a certain threshold , and this is a normal development ; just like the italian border near slovenia tends to be quite empty as well compared to other similar regions . 
  i 've lived near the border between portugal and spain , the two languages are very close so usually we 'd just speak whatever . 
  the truth is that there is * very * little people really living near borders in general , with some exceptions here and there , like vienna/bratislava . 
  if your father has an eu passport and you are his son and a minor , chances are you can also get citizenship . 
  the advantages is that you can live and work anywhere in the eu if you have eu citizenship , as well as freely come here for however long you want to and stay ( you will be required to register as a resident if you count on staying in one place for a long-term time , you have 3 months to do so or you may get in serious trouble ) . 
  it is pretty unclear to me who exactly is who here . 
  does your father remain a german citizen ? 
  or was he naturalized as a us citizen , thus losing his eu citizenship ? 
  keep in mind : just because you have a german passport , this does not at all mean you will be regarded by europeans as a german . 
  you are and will be treated as , still , an outsider . 
  i think that there are still some smaller parts of societal living that are worse for a gender rather than the other . 
  it really goes both ways , men for example can not as easily share interests in beauty products without seeming `` unmanly '' and such ; the same way women are often driven to take less an interest is seemingly `` unfeminine '' elements like firefighting . 
  there are , in fact , a decreasing amount of these occasions , and men and women alike can fully live out their lives as they wish here ; but i do n't think that a full egalitarian society even exists anywhere in the world . 
  the sexes are equal to everyone , but societal small norms here and there continue to exist understatedly . 
  not really between the dutch and the belgians , it 's more a person-to-person thing . 
  obviously most people look at him as dutch , but then some * seriously * defend he 's not dutch and he 's german or sometimes even habsburg ; mainly on the basis that there was no `` dutch '' yet until he made it but it 's complicated since * the dutch nation * very much was already there , just not really solid in its own state . 
  yeah , i remember them , and i 've always thought that they can kiss my ass over their claims . 
  i also remember [ this gem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3wuxelokja ) , haaan ? 
  this is the first time i 'm hearing about this . 
  well , we have basically the [ mcdaddy of the netherlands ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn1pau0awk8 ) : stille willem ( silent william ) aka willem van oranje ( william of orange ) . 
  he was born in what now is hesse , then he first served the habsburgs ( for the habsburgs netherlands , then spain ( for the spanish netherlands ) , until he had enough of their shite and made his own damn country . 
  so he can be sorta german , or `` dutch '' but being dutch was not a thing just * yet * . 
  i was born and grew up in portugal , then i moved to france , and now i live in the netherlands . 
  in an odd way i would n't really want to change it since i appreciate that even though it was n't exactly a model childhood and things were n't always easy , it still made me who i am today . 
  so i 'm not sure where but i 'd like for it to be the same 2 countries i grew up in : portugal and france . 
  i was in one hosted by my university , and i thought it was a pretty fun experience . 
  it was n't at all as developed nor as big as the ones hosted in strasbourg and such , but more of a small activity to demonstrate the dynamics of the eu more closely . 
  either slovakia or slovenia , hands down . 
  i did , and that is because that 's what the main opinion is over there . 
  the lowest being in korea and the highest being in vietnam . 
  it has reached a point that it is overall negative , though keep in mind that this is something that has only really happened these years now , and it can as quickly change for best and worst . 
  oh my god can you actually read my points . 
  i 've travelled for two years in taiwan , korea , japan , and vietnam . 
  yes they are happy with the * status quo of being protected by the us * but keep in mind that it is the * status quo * . 
  the ** recent ** stances the us has adventured itself on is what ultimately tarnished us foreign policy 's reputation . 
  the us also protected the everlasting fuck out of west germany from the eastern bloc , it protected portugal from spain , it even greatly helped europe against nazi germany . 
  the us is not at all a huge empire of evil ; and it did and does a lot of good to this day . 
  ** that being said ** the good it does has become understated since it 's primordially and above all the main status quo and * not * something new ; what * is * new is very controversial issues such as going ham in the middle east or calling it quits in the paris agreement or even the financial crisis of 2007 . 
  * people have opinions on current events and it shows , their opinion over us foreign policy is currently at a low due to ** recent ** issues and controversial events *, 
  why does alliances have anything to do with public opinion of us foreign policy ? 
  france is a huge `` friend '' of the us ( if you want to call it that ) but i can tell you after years of living there that the french * seriously * dislike us foreign policy . 
  i 'm not holding the us responsible for people living under authoritarian regimes , but to say that people like it when their oppressors get support due to us foreign policy is pretty daft . 
  in a matter of public opinion you look for * the opinion of the public * and as you can guess , it 's pretty poor in these years . 
  when you head to south america , generally people like * the us * but hate their foreign policy .
