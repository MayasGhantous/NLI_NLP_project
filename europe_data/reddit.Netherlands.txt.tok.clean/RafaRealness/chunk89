  when you go to africa , somewhat the same . 
  when you go to asia , the same opinion prevails . 
  on social media , on news medias , and even on the streets of these countries is something i 've always seen and seems pretty evident . 
  so again , you 're not really showing anything to indicate otherwise , and you can reject whatever claims you want , much like your president rejects climate change nowadays . 
  * again * you miss my point : i said that even though us foreign policy * has * done a lot of good in the world , due to the recent bullshit the world has had to face due to the more shittier sides of it ( like going ham on afghanistan ) it obviously lost a fuck tonne of popularity worldwide , not just europe . 
   buddy , what do you want ? 
  i could use a new phone , and a trip to bratislava . 
   you 've got the fucking flag next to your name . 
  if you want to bring up portugal , just bring it up . 
  my use of `` your pm '' is a dumb thing to object to . 
  yeah because * i live here * not only that , i do n't consider trump a representation of you nor george bush or obama ; they are the leader of your country but they are * not * every single american voter . 
  so tell me what the fuck a pm i 've never even lived under nor voted for has anything to do with this . 
   yeah , who do you think stands in between china and taiwan , for example ? 
  why does n't china just go invade them ? 
  * woosh * my damn point is that yes the us foreign policy does sometimes benefit some a lot , and that 's another case where it does . 
  you can not , however , say that it is not highly criticized and disputed because of the more recent controversial shite it 's been doing like , oh i do n't know , funding terror organizations that afterwards generated a comeback of terrorism ? 
   how would you like to see a clip of your former pm claiming that the security umbrella provided by the us is a historical anomaly that lifted billions out of poverty ? 
  * my * former pm ? 
  do you know where i 'm actually from ? 
  i was born and raised in portugal ; a country that for decades was at the claws of salazar 's estado novo regime , oppressing and killing thousands of us . 
  and guess who supported him ? 
  the us has done a lot of good for the world , that 's true , for example , it was one of the biggest supporters of the early stages of the ecsc , and protected western europe against a potential communist threat . 
  however to say that in recent years it has been a benevolent force that is liked in the world is far from the reality of the situation . 
  yes , it 's not like there 's an even bigger disdain for it in asia , the middle east , africa , south america , etc. . . 
  ya know , where all those dictatorships the us helped fund are/were ? 
  this looks like some weird high fashion runway look nobody understands but somehow it 's * h a u t e c o u t u r e *, 
  it will , there 's lots of services available for handicapped people not only in ns but in nearly all of the netherlands . 
  it 's pretty good for disabled people to visit i 'd say , except maybe the really dense small streets that might be a bit more difficult to navigate . 
  absolute hooliganish morons with nothing better ado than cause havoc and destruction . 
  the lowest trash i 've seen in a while . 
  they are n't worth my time , the sole thing they are worthy of is to face justice for the utterly barbaric behavior they had by vandalizing the fuck out of the place just `` to send a message '' . 
   there 's also an immigrant party ( denk ) i would n't call them an immigrant party , they are ** horrible ** at representing immigrants in my opinion ; they are in reality the turk party . 
  well , what makes wales and scotland hold such feelings towards england ? 
  in an outsider perspective it seems that within the uk , england is so big in the uk that it essentially dominates it , a recent example being brexit , where scotland and northern ireland voted to stay yet are still getting out . 
  i also believe that the scottish tuition fee is a result of direct imbalances between scotland 's qualified workforce and england 's . 
  is scotland 's education as good as their english counterparts ? 
  is there a brain-drain effect from scotland to england ? 
  there are multiple issues that would justify the system , or at least warrant better than just `` tuition fees for all '' . 
  so the problem is n't really the payment , it 's the spending . 
  i still do n't see much of an issue since this seems like the normal course of a country . 
  scotland is not up to the same level as england and it even shows in life expectancy ; it 's poorer than england and needs more funding per capita ( plus , it 's even much less populated than england itself ) . 
  for me it seems very logical , and very recurring in every country i know of . 
  do the english also * earn * a lot more ? 
  i mean , north and south holland pay a lot more than , say , friesland ; but it 's not an issue , we just happen to * make * more money but we 're still the same country , and this is part of such . 
  ... wait what ? 
  but who would ? 
  everyone in the uk pays taxes , to run the government . 
  true . 
  maybe a more federal uk is a better course of action overall . 
  well , then again , snp lost quite a lot of their following , and considering how the tories are with healthcare i 'd be somewhat happy to oppose them . 
  there 's an annoying couple of them near my house ; and every time i hear them ranting outside in the park about it i just think to myself [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpulw7r9hza ), 
  what advantages would it bring to england to have its own parliament ? 
  well if it 's a problem for england , it could just declare independence and call it an afternoon . 
  understood . 
  i guess jerusalem is already where it should be , if it 's used the same as the other unofficial anthems . 
  \u041e\u043e\u043e\u043e\u043eh , i thought that they were official for ni , wales , and scotland but not england for some odd reason . 
  do n't listen to that noise . 
  learning a new language gives you a new perspective on the world , and even yourself ; it 's an amazing pleasure and opportunity to learn it . 
  as i see it , there is * no * way to can as intimately approach norwegian ( or any ) culture without speaking the language , and if genuinely it is something you 'd like to do ; by all means go for it . 
  it 's true that it 's a bit hard to find people to practice with , but just ask really kindly ; i have the same problem with dutch sometimes . 
  how come england does n't have an anthem ? 
  but scotland does ? 
  yup , that 's true . 
  i think that france has a correct stance in the matter of assimilation and the dominance of french culture and language ; i think , however , that in middle and high schools in france , not enough is done for foreign languages nor history ; they remain very francocentric and seem a bit dimmer than their other european counterparts . 
  it 's an amazing song , i 'd love to see it become official for england . 
   i think my gay is showing ... * show me yours and i 'll show you mine * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  well , i 'd say that there is an overarching french culture , and under it there are different smaller cultures such as the more assimilated ones like the breton culture . 
  i still agree that yes , multiculturalism is not really a thing in france , and france remains a place where immigrants are expected to adapt and adopt it . 
  i do n't really know about * cheapest * but i do believe that the netherlands , due to the quality and openness of its dental care services , should be a strong contender in your consideration . 
  i ca n't really tell you what you need since i 'm not a dentist at all ; though for context i can tell you that a two-implant in jaw for an implant-borne dentures surgery is ** the ** most expensive thing on this list , and it costs $ 467.62 , which is less than a tenth of $ 5,000 . 
  i seriously doubt you 'll have to pay $ 5,000 or more for the whole treatment ; that 's a * lot * of money . 
  please , however , check details with whichever dental practice you choose ( i recommend [ this ] ( http://tandartspraktijk-zuidoost.nl/ ) one , which follows the price chart , and everyone speaks and is ready to treat you in english ) . 
   so people not voting when given the option means that the election practically speaking did n't happen at all , and the eu is at fault for a democratic deficiency ? 
  if people do n't even * know * their options nor how the system works , and the eu has its hands tied and can not meaningfully tackle the issue head-on ; it 's a pretty sad but still existent democratic deficit . 
  the eu would need to be able to directly `` spoon feed '' in essence the basics to its own citizens , yet it holds no such power and the member states ' civic education courses are ( in my experience ) lazy in the matter . 
   and here i always thought that when people chose not to vote in an election , it was their fault that they got no input on the result of the election . 
  i did not say they * chose * not to vote , i said that due to the fact that they do n't know nor their options nor the process for the election ; it is part of the problem that generates a democratic deficit . 
  i love the eu but are we seriously going to ignore its flaws ? 
  no , we need the euro to eliminate needless costs and risks that came from having an internal market without a common currency that have costed the jobs of thousands of people . 
  not only that , we also needed the euro to support a better european framework capable of hosting a reunified germany as well as break the overbaring domination of the deutschmark over other currencies , thus giving smaller states a say . 
  the netherlands has * very * good service , so you can very easily go to a dental practice ( in dutch : tandartspraktijk ) and consult with them the best course of action to solve your overbite . 
  [ most use this price chart ] ( https://www.tandarts.nl/tandartstarieven/2017 ) which includes * everything * a practice can do . 
  the thing is that i 'm unsure how it 'll work if you do n't have a bsn ( burgerservicenummer , a resident 's number basically ) , however i 'm fairly certain you can ask for a consultation at least . 
  * please do * keep in mind to contact the practice you 're interested in * before * doing anything ; since a few of them actually do n't follow this price table and charge more ( ask in advance ) and also ask if , as a non-resident in the netherlands , you can effectively get treatment there . 
  well , yes , but the eu is n't really a country , is it ? 
  some people are still * very * attached to their member state and see their state as a country , and the eu as just an organization that sometimes tries to take over a bit too much . 
  i know the dutch ministers , for example , and i know who appointed them , and how this all works , but for the eu we have 28 different commissioners we 've mostly heard nothing about each one and we do n't know how the dossiers are distributed nor why * they * were appointed etc. . . 
  the commission thus does n't really seem elected , since one country gets 1/28th of a representation there , and nobody knows what it 'll do , nor who even decides so . 
  as for parliamentary elections turnouts being low , you can blame the voters all you want but i 'd blame misinformation and * still * the need for pan-european election options . 
  most people do n't even know they can vote and much less * how * to vote , and this is a seriously difficult problem to tackle by the perspective of the eu . 
  how do you inform people on how to vote for the european parliament elections without having at least 12 angry mobs at your door shouting `` eu-sponsored propaganda '' ? 
  the thing is that we can not ignore that the parliament elections still has low turnouts . 
  so it 's a big missed opportunity already there . 
  not to mention , you can vote for your * national * parties , but if you want to defend a party that just so happens to be from a member state across a border , tough tits , you ca n't . 
  the commission is basically filled with people that the voters are unfamiliar with , and did not really vote for directly . 
  to the voter , they just * appeared * and that 's that ; same goes for the president of the commission . 
  it 's a * far * less direct system than , say , a full actual election . 
  there is a democratic deficit in the eu , even with the arrangements that have been taken to solve it ; there are still problems that make the eu seem undemocratic to a lot of people . 
  depends on the already existing structure of the university and the general interests of students . 
  well , the eu is basically a `` sui genesis '' when it comes to its definition but for this case let 's treat it as a very powerful multilateral agreement .
