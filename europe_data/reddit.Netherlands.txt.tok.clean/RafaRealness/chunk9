  guess your username checks out . 
  so again , are you saying that the uk , due to its size , can not efficiently run under the dutch system ? 
  ( ps : the norwegian and the swedish system are very different from the dutch , we do n't even have the same type of law ) . 
  but the dutch system is not that liked by the dutch ( since it has problems keeping poorer people protected ) , plus it is also still highly in the hands of the government itself , so i fail to see how you 'd rather a system where you have to pay up more to essentially get the same service you do now , and also discriminate against poorer people who merely can not afford to get better health protection and the * one * day they need serious help they are basically financially decimated ... you 've got a good system that is facing problems , but instead of solving the problems in a timely manner , the whole shenanigans turned into `` nhs is fucked , time to send it to hell '' . 
  look at university costs in the uk , it is very close to the system we have for health coverage , and it is not capped ( for some reason the uk lets prices get wild to the point of ridiculousness ) and what do they do ? 
  keep rising and rising and so it is more difficult for poorer societal classes to access them . 
  same can happen with the dutch system without heavy governmental relating to the private rule of companies in terms of health insurance , because it 's a market that is ( very sadly ) easy to harvest if we let them get too cozy . 
  do n't make the same mistakes , in the netherlands you will have to pay a * bare minimum * of 1100 $ per year * as a student * ( if you are not a student you pay considerably more ) and if your medical costs get too expensive , then you must cough up your eigen risico , which for some people is near unaffordable . 
  i 'm lucky i 'm covered by the portuguese health system ( with the ehic ) but i also understand that my fellow dutch students are not as lucky in the least , hell , i had to lend money to a friend because of this system so she could * eat * something after being sick ... 
  you said `` the netherlands is small , the uk is far bigger '' , so size matters ? 
  also , who exactly cut funds to the nhs and now is even threatening nhs skilled workers that they might lose their residency ? 
  and what is the alternative for britain without the nhs ? 
  go back to a privatized american-like system ? 
   shamelessly linking myself * yeah you link yourself you slut , oh yeah . 
  so the uk is too big to be democratic and more efficient at representing its own people ? 
  til . 
  tories did n't really protect shit , plus just take a look at how they treat the uk 's social services . 
  that 's what they think of you , so go ahead , be happy . 
  ... you * are * aware that `` a european system '' does n't mean anything , right ? 
  i mean , the uk is still in europe so your system is a european system too , and so is the belarus and russian systems , and the german , and the portuguese , and the serbian ... also , what exactly makes you think that the netherlands has an issue ? 
  we 've had our unemployment go down quite a lot , as well as pushes for more development in social and economic causes , plus , try to beat us in environment protection , i dare you . 
  we 've got a damn good system , that represents the citizens , and though it has some drawbacks like giving the pvv so many seats ( but hey , that 's what the people voted for that 's what the people get ) we still are competent enough to have a sane system where extremists get nowhere without 50 % +1 votes and the government is not under the rule of * one * party . 
  but then again , if you want to keep your system , good for you , keep it . 
  i 'm happy with my system so i guess we 're both lucky to live under our respective preferences . 
  do you remember the days before the cm though ? 
  countries were essentially dominated by the strongest economy in the bloc : west germany , whereas with a common market , we * all * get a better say both in terms of intergovernmental interactions ( such as the european council or the council of ministers ) or supranational representation ( parliament or commission ) to get shit done . 
  i agree that the eu should ease off the refugee issue , as it does * not * concern it , however i also believe that all schengen-zone countries need to work together to solve our clearly lacking borders . 
  italy and greece are overwhelmed , spain is fucked over with ceuta , and they need help , so our countries must coordinate to offer better protection of our external borders , something that can be done * without * the eu . 
  the eu is n't even really that strong , i mean , consider the decision making process we have today , and really the eu is more of a hybrid between intergovernmental and supranational entities that all represent either governments or european voters , so it 's more of an incredibly giant conference negotiations table if anything . 
  i am hopeful ( but not holding my breath ) that brexit will give the uk a shakeup on its way of running things . 
  i believe that the british public deserve a better government , and especially not just a binary one where it 's usually either labour or tories , but actually have more choice with nuance . 
  i do n't know if it 's just wishful thinking , and maybe it is , but oh well , guess we all need to keep on hoping and working for change . 
  well , i 'm all for democratic rule , but i prefer the dutch system for democracy than the british one with their crappy `` first past the post '' system that generates a binary bullshit government . 
  in the netherlands we often are accused of having too many parties represented , but i still prefer a coalition government that more fairly represents the dutch vote than just some `` yes/no '' situation that may not even work because as we can see the uk can easily be ran by a minority government and just be cruising . 
  we had that with the eec , i 'll let you look up what happened next . 
  free trade and travel vs common market is a huge assumption that people believe are the same but they are very different things , and personally i prefer a common market over just free trade and travel because the former would result in both my countries ( portugal and france ) be * far * worse off than what we got now , and the same for the netherlands . 
   pot meet kettle . 
  my favourite expression , oh how i 've missed you . 
  the word play always makes me smile a bit , it 's just a funny little thing . 
  if i ever go there , i 'll be sure to turn on grindr to see what 's what . 
  i know a guy whose ultimate fantasy was a sexy priest . 
  yup . 
  i love royal families to be honest , but i hate it when they get political . 
  they must stay strictly a symbol of our cultures and identities , even they can be ceremonial , i think it 's cool . 
  but the second they start shit , they are gon na get hit . 
   my offer to fistfight her still stands i already like you . 
  thanks , i respect your religious beliefs . 
  i do wonder though , why do you want lepen to win , and what do you think of the polls so far ? 
  good for you , i 'm an atheist , i do n't believe in gods . 
  then on what basis do you make the assumption she will win ? 
  based on your best wishes ? 
  whereas actual studies and raw data display a very different outcome that by the day is becoming less likely as lepen 's already reduced popularity keeps degrading ? 
  whatever floats your boat , i for one trust polls that are n't guesses . 
  check the polls and check the french election system . 
  i 'm not even gon na say anything , the data speaks for itself . 
  i am still laughing about how tragic that is , i mean seriously . 
  * herpes on your wikipedia page that is just gold *, 
  [ someone whose picture in wikipedia has a very noticeable labial herpes outbreak , unrelated to my opinion of this law but damn that is sad and tragically hilarious ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders_ygeman ), 
  who 's / what 's ygeman ? 
  nah , i like their money , and will enjoy their tears if they lose the rights to come over . 
  maybe i 'm not reading this right , but the two do n't sound alike . 
  delors sounds like duh-lorsssss whereas senors sounds like s\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9h-nursssss . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's just me though . 
  ** one of us one of us one of us one of us ** be warned though , we have ripe idiots here too . 
  look at the netherlands where the fucking pvv ( wilders ' party ) got so many seats ... fuck sake . 
  well , not every single british citizen voted , some were n't even allowed , plus there * are * arguments for brexit that are still true ( though they usually are understated to leave more shouting space to the red bus of lies committee ) . 
  we still love ya do n't worry . 
  * asking nicely ~ *, 
  not sure why you are getting downvoted , i think you 're possibly right . 
  rest assured , we do n't , we 're mainly judging the wasteful idiots that read the sun . 
  you give the sun far too much credit to be bothered to google translate a word . 
  damn , beat me to it . 
  * uk france italy holland croatia austria ... * *** & spain !, 
  ... i do n't even care what this toilet paper roll says , we 're talking about a `` news `` paper that offers * a free poster inside * . 
  what i ** do ** care about deeply is the accurate spelling of the word se\u00f1ores . 
  after erdogan called us fashishts , we have been close to anarchy . 
  junker wo n't last through the night . 
  ** the end is near ** *** / s ***, 
  ... but who 's threatening of taking * anything * ? 
   spain ** i am triggered in 3 different nationalities how dare you **, 
  they joined before the euro was a mandatory requirement , so they can just not join the eurozone . 
  croatia on the other hand is legally bound to do so once requirements are met . 
  it is basically a matter of time before the salty brexiteers arrive and shout at everything . 
  be right back , cooking the popcorn . 
  it is referring to the peoples of europe , as per the treaty of rome . 
  but sure , fuck diversity , let 's live in isolated nation-states , where would i live then ? 
  portugal or france ? 
  concordia is the latin word for harmony though . 
  i am half portuguese half french and i live in the netherlands . 
  it is pretty clear that i love our union and its members . 
  ** in diversitate concordia **, 
  til that melenchon is actually a commie ... did an american write this article ? 
  i mean jesus christ , melenchon * is * pretty leftist but calling him a communist is quite a stretch . 
  got ta say , this is quality bait , nearly fell for it . 
  hats off to that . 
   i agree completely , but what 's happening now is the opposite . 
  there are protests in france and in the us against police brutality , which may well be a problem in some cases , but this anti-police mindset will make the problem worse . 
  many of the activists want the police to retreat from these areas and do less policing because they feel that the extra policing of these areas is discrimination . 
  this for me is also true but it is an even bigger underlying problem that is a consequence of these areas going undereducated and underemployed for generations on end . 
  all over the world , not just in france , the police forces merely are losing temperament with these areas and as such we see more cases of police brutality .
