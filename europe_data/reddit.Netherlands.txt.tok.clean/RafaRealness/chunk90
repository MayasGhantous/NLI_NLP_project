  multilateral agreements are maintained between 3 or more governments . 
  so it 'll remain so until it loses all but 2 members . 
  if it reaches 2 members , then it becomes a * bilateral * agreement , which still changes nothing , it 's just basically a different name . 
  if then one of the two members decide to break the deal then * poof * there 's no eu . 
  also , for the sake of my sanity : ** stop using the word `` nation '' as a synonym for `` state '' , the two are not the same thing **, 
  i made a whole thesis with a lot of cases where the laws regarding human dignity are used to ban certain things that would be seen as unreasonably banned in germany . 
  it was n't the main point of it at all but it definitely was an interesting factor when it comes to german law and its usage of human dignity , even though it 's never really been properly defined . 
  [ this case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omega_spielhallen_und_automatenaufstellungs-gmbh_v_oberb%c3%bcrgermeisterin_der_bundesstadt_bonn ) basically a lazer game service was banned in germany under the pretext that simulating shooting people is an infraction on the protection of human dignity . 
  not to mention the pretty heavy limitations on other industries involving video games and movies that portray or simulate violence . 
  my great grand parents were all born in portugal , my grand parents were born in portugal , my parents were born in portugal , i was born in portugal . 
  not only that , i look very much like the same ethnic group as our historical pictures and portraits . 
  i see no point on paying for essentially an american commercial scam with loose science attributed to it . 
  i 'd much rather have a vastly extended family tree ( with proof ) to see such a thing instead of relying on a shoddy expensive service . 
  like , every two or three days i think . 
  especially when i do groceries at lidl and such . 
  i think that human dignity in the german constitution is often misused for other purposes , such as for example banning lazer games in the omega spielhallen case a few years back . 
  it should more properly be defined , to avoid such issues and uses of it for often too harsh censorship in german law . 
  remember that email that one of your disciples sent that started with `` we the people '' ? 
  sorta like that , but mainly just rules on how the state works . 
   flemish belgians what 's that ? 
  is it a pastry ? 
  you fellow dutchies have always been so creative :'), 
  compare it to germany , and then compare it again with refugees per capita . 
  the us took a laughably low amount . 
  i think that such ambitions are n't frowned upon , but we definitely value results * far * more than just words . 
  success speaks for itself here . 
  it 's seen as `` meh '' . 
  everyone wants to be a millionaire , a successful [ insert high position here ] . 
  in the netherlands it 's good to have ambition but it 's boring ; we want you to ** do ** it rather than talk about it . 
  nobody likes someone who brags about how they `` have it all figured out '' and such , in fact bragging is a pretty hefty no-no here even if you * are * very successful . 
  rule of thumb : let your success and actions speak for themselves . 
  stop funding terrorist organizations in the future . 
  stop bombing the everlasting crap out of the world * please * take responsibility and take in some of the refugees . 
  better often means more expensive . 
  more expensive means * more money is needed * . 
  that , i disagree with entirely . 
  our * parliament * represents us all ; we disagree but here is where we come together and talk it through . 
  if older citizens feel like they want to be represented by their own party and it happens to be 50plus then so be it . 
  we are ** not ** a one-party state like china . 
  ... are we going to ignore how it was back when we did n't have the euro ? 
  in the netherlands , we lost a great company due to currency fluctuations , fokker went bankrupt because of multiple changes in currency afterwards . 
  now with the euro it is * far * better and easier to trade with the rest of the eurozone . 
  in portugal , we had a currency that was constantly being devalued to promote exports which , sure , guarantees we stay productive , but it also ensured imports were hard and that we stayed behind in foreign products , even vhs tapes ... 
  economically there are studies that prove that the euro has benefited the eurozone area in terms of economic stability , trade , and ease of mobiliy ; the * real * problem with the euro is its incomplete and shoddy design . 
  tourists spend money , money can be exchanged for goods and services , this means that * because of tourists * you can pursue more goods and services . 
  they also spend money on taxable products , which in turn means our government disposes of more funds for stuff we * very * much enjoy , such as public schooling . 
  paradoxical situation , you basically do n't . 
  i mean , you could try to keep housing * artificially * low but that would generate far more problems than it would solve . 
  in the netherlands , we have lots of great urban places that are n't very touristy , as well as very good public transit between these and the touristy ones ; so a lot of people live in nice quieter cities like hilversum , and come to work in amsterdam every day . 
  what 's the latvian process for constitutional amendments ? 
  i disagree , i believe that we should maintain our government for as long as it is stable and does not degrade our situation in the least ; unless its term is over after 4 years or there are actual calls for a snap election . 
  yep , and luxembourg city . 
  well , i 'm * very * happy with the dutch constitution , though there 's an indirect detail i think merits some debate : article 53 says that the upper and lower house will be elected by proportional representation as laid down by the act of parliament . 
  i think that the act of parliament should include a minimum of seats a party must achieve in order to be represented , in order to avoid having ridiculous cases such as fvf ( forum voor democratie ) holding two seats . 
  i believe the minimum seats should be * at least * 4 or 5 to prevent having so many teeny tiny little fringe parties taking up seats and making our already complex coalition formation even * more * painful . 
   it looks like gambling only exists in impoverished places where the government needs money by essentially taxing the poor and making the venue even worse off . 
  * what ? 
  * it is legal in the netherlands but highly regulated , meaning that for example it can not occur publicly , you need appropriate licenses for that sort of business , your advertisement is very limited , and absolutely ** no ** minors in the establishment . 
   you do n't use your throat for either of those ... maybe you 're not going far enough ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  well , i do n't think it 's the case for everyone though . 
  some people very much think in one determinate language at any given time . 
  so this method would basically be an accelerated process . 
  you take up more but you also produce more . 
  so what is the downside ? 
  i mean if one option is more damaging to the land ( ie take its nutriments faster ) than others , thus rendering it less useful faster than the others . 
  aaaah , makes sense then . 
  is there any data on land fertility results with non-gmo crops and gmo crops ? 
  as well as hybrids ? 
  but only one can be ** america 's next top model **, 
  i 'd say all of the above actually , hehe . 
   oh wow lol . 
  ** surprise ** i 'm the sneakier spanish inquisition : the * portuguese * immigration . 
   i know boa sorte means good luck , see i 'm a pro already . 
  yep it does !, 
  i 'm fairly sure that if you like the language you 'll be able to fully learn it ; and afterwards if you choose to learn another language , your experience will make it * way * easier . 
  i 'm fluent in portuguese ( it 's my native language ) so feel free to ask anything at all at any time !, 
  boa sorte !, 
  not * yet * never too late to learn a new language !, 
  i do n't think in * a * language ; in my head it 's just all the languages i speak mixed together . 
  aaah , makes sense then , yes . 
  i was imagining something north korea-style with the never-off radios in every home and in the streets . 
  i 've never seen this in real life . 
  i thought this was only in north korea or something ? 
  what would they even say ? 
  would they just blare out at 8am `` it is rainy outside please wear a light jacket '', 
  in a * very * unconventional way , i 'd say maybe berlin . 
  do n't lynch me , but there is just a certain atmosphere that it has , an urban paradise sort of thing . 
  it is not conventionally beautiful like paris or amsterdam with their classic gorgeous architecture , it 's more beautiful in an odd way on how the whole city just feels urban but alive ; the contrasts between this and that building , the movement of lights during the night , etc. . . 
  it just all feels like an amazing experience , maybe not conventionally beautiful , but in my eyes still a fair contender . 
  my friend 's from there !, 
  i 'm pretty interested since it looks like a fun place to visit . 
  heard it 's got some pretty good food . 
  ** unlimited claimable laaaand **, 
  well , i was taught that most gmo seeds are n't really recyclable ; meaning that you use them and the work ; but they will not generate more by themselves . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , though . 
  cute , coming from the guy who came all this way to make a childish comment without a single element to contribute to any part of the thread . 
  kindly write down your opinion on a piece of paper , have it mailed to me by registered courier , so that i can carefully read it , and wipe my ass with it . 
  what about all other member states ? 
  we need to decentralize the marketshare over these productions and certify that there is absolutely no chance of any state ever getting screwed over . 
  the difference is that we do not at all have the us system , where a candidate that got * less * votes can be elected over another .
