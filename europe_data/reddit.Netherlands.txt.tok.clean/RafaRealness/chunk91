  our systems were designed with extremism deeply imprinted in the minds of our ancestors ( spain being no exception , after franco 's dictatorship ) and so i trust our governments to not fall as easily at the hands of far-right extremism , and to uphold democracy . 
  the people ? 
  not much , really dislike how serious religion is taken over there , but i do n't know to what extent it is the people and to what extent it is the governments . 
  the governments ? 
  i seriously dislike the fuck out of them for horrid laws that undermine human rights , and also unproductive efficiency leaving thousands ( if not more ) in want . 
  what i * do * like is their history and more ancient cultures that are now gone . 
  i also really enjoy their foods usually , as well as some architectural audacity they take . 
  i have a huge passion for foreign languages . 
  when you learn a new language to the point you can fully work with that language , you see the world differently , you even see yourself differently . 
  it 's as if languages provide you with different lenses of which you can see the world , and comment on it . 
  it also can just transport you to new places and cultures you 've yet to see , like for example knowing just how good victor hugo 's works are in their original language ; or singing along the \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 and actually understand it . 
  basically a new language is stepping into a different reality , another you 's shoes ; and i can not express how magical that is to me at times . 
  no , not really . 
  let me give you two examples i believe illustrate the situation well : when the dutch had their elections this year , nearly all foreign medias i 've read were panicking over geert wilders `` winning '' ; which did not at all seem like an actual `` thing '' here because he 'd need 50 % +1 of the vote to ever rule ( nobody wants to work with his party ) . 
  so there was this ** huge ** exaggeration of his actual power and what the reality of the situation was . 
  much of the same can be said for the french election , it and this time i 'd say that * some * french medias also hyped fears for the far right during the elections . 
  so although it may * seem * like it , it 's mainly just a lot of worry and such . 
  both are not dutch , both are foreign to me . 
  we need more providers and a less centralized market in this industry , to ensure a healthy competitive market upon which it will be far more easy to rely on with such a delicate affair . 
  yes , i agree , though i still believe that politically and structurally gmos are not risk-free for everyone . 
  i do n't want my domestic production to grow dependent on a foreign company , nor do i want the gmo seeds market to keep being so centred in few providers . 
  i believe the best course of action is to slowly allow more gmos to be produced and sold , and at the same time develop new producers of gmo seeds to have a healthy competitive market . 
   bayer is buying monsanto , basf is german , and syngenta is swiss . 
   yes , and i 'd much rather not be dependent nor on the swiss nor on the germans with affairs such as domestic food safety . 
   so then go back to the seeds you were using if anything like that ever happens ( which it wo n't ) . 
  this protectionism ( even though three of the major companies are or will soon be european ) is getting you nowhere . 
  i believe that you are right , and we should stop this practice , but also have a far more competitive gmo seeds market , as well as more regulative measures to ensure we 're not dependent on anyone single-handedly . 
  i know , and i think that gmos should be far more allowed into the eu ; under the strict condition that we do not become dependent from a 3rd party to provide gmo seeds ( they do n't really reproduce ) . 
  there is a lot of needless resistance against it , i was merely explaining what the official procedure is . 
  yes , that is also true , because if we grow far more dependent on gmos that means that we will be dependent on a foreign producer of these seeds that by design can not easily be reproduced . 
   i only speak one language . 
  alright . 
   i look like i should speak another language . 
  well , nobody `` looks '' like they should speak another language . 
   and then people laugh when they find out i ca n't . 
  well , people are cunts , just brush it off and carry on with your day . 
   it makes me feel like i want to die and strangle people at the same time . 
  chill , they can merely laugh , there 's not much more they can do . 
   does anyone else know what i 'm feeling ? 
  how do you deal with it ? 
  i used to be laughed at for being extremely inapt socially and also shite at pe . 
  mainly i stopped giving a flying fuck and focused on what i ** am ** good at . 
  i 'll never be a pilot probably , i 'll likely wo n't be a scientist either , but i 'll be fucked if i am not good with history at least . 
  focus on what makes you , * you * . 
  furthermore , do you * want * to learn a new language ? 
  because that 's also something you can do , it 's hard but so is everything new . 
  not at all easy , and you will get fined to shit . 
  pay your fare and do n't be a cheap cunt . 
  / thread, 
  because * most * gmos are still banned . 
  there are great concerns over the health effects of gmos , but also their sustainability ( their effects on the earth they grow from ) . 
  thus any and all gmos are not authorized ** except ** if approved by the competent scientific authorities that they are fully harmless . 
  this takes a ** very ** long time to check , and as a result , europe remains a place with very little gmo development . 
  no problem at all . 
  i think that the pros and cons from immigration should carefully be debated to come up with a solution to the cons while in the mean time guaranteeing the pros go untouched . 
  the problem is that the dialogue of such a thing has become so toxic nowadays ... 
  tall glass of cold milk . 
  just like any other breakfast . 
  portugal : i have yet to meet someone who * does n't * pirate anything , seriously . 
  absolutely nothing ever happens france : unless you leave a torrent client seeding for days on a row , nothing will happen to you , basically . 
  you can get fined a * lot * of money ( and you get a warning too ) but i have yet to see anything happen . 
  netherlands : not a lot of piracy because netflix and stuff has a good selection , and it is n't * as big * a thing as portugal , but still existent . 
  similarly it is not dealt with by authorities that i can tell in any instance ever . 
  i really like berska stuff . 
  mainly their design , i just like the style , if it looks like it but is some other brand i 'll be equally as happy . 
  i really liked the dutch ones from 1999 to 2013 in the 1 $ and 2 $ coins . 
  the profile of ( now former ) queen beatrix with the small text looked very elegant to me . 
  not a fan of the new one they did for king willem , it should have been the same design but with his face . 
  i also really like malta 's design with a very simple yet immediately recognizable national symbol . 
  i believe that there * must * be better and less toxic dialogue between serbian and kosovar leaders , with mutual respect for both communities ; meaning that the priority , no matter * what * solution is , should always be prosperity and safety for whoever lives in both ( be it serbs or kosovars ) . 
  with that , there should be negotiations about being a permanently autonomous region in serbia with powers that can not by design be alienated from kosovo towards the main serbian government without full consent of the region ; or alternatively be a sovereign state with clear agreements on both sides to protect minorities on both sides . 
  on the eu 's side , i believe that * if really there is a call for the eu to intervene * then having one common voice and agreed course of action should be a primordial priority before any and all action . 
  tl ; dr : ** fucking stop hating each other , sit down and talk through a solution , and put people 's safety and comfort over shite politics for fuck 's sake ** it 's an idealist view , i doubt it 'll happen , just the kosovar parliament has cunts pulling off gas bombs just because they do n't agree ... 
  no , no , mate . 
  we 're just gon na pass you some joints . 
  * set of colonies, 
  nope !, 
  i 've moved around quite a lot , and for me the netherlands is the best country for me to live in . 
  it may not be the best for everyone , but for me it 's a * very * clear winner . 
  as someone who studies eu law , structure , and history ; i can tell you that you 're actually full of shit . 
  the eu is still momentarily * not * a fully supranational entity and thus far there are more pushes for more intergovernmental control over it than before . 
  you ** still ** have not answered the question , because you want to live in what * you * believe the future will hold : a fully functionalist integration in the european project , which is delusional considering what 's happening right now . 
  you live in a continent with a union that has 28 member states , which ** all are countries still ** are you going to answer the question or not ? 
  i can say i regard canada and the us as 1 country , it does n't make it a reality . 
  you 're not really answering the question , just saying `` i love the eu '' . 
  i would but only when it becomes * very * used and common among europeans . 
  otherwise it would be just esperanto 2.0 which i do n't see much of any use for . 
   a fixed version of britain france ** / s **, 
  ... but what country would you like to live in if you had complete freedom to move ? 
  * your g\u00f6tterfunken caught my attention ~ *, 
  oh , makes sense then . 
  israel is a pretty nice place , i kinda really wan na visit it . 
  is this a real question , or just your rant about it ? 
  based on extremely inaccurate and unargumented assumptions ? 
  i think that there 's no such thing as `` going full american '' to begin with . 
  we 're all worried over the migration crisis and obviously populist movements are gon na take a bit of a boost , and even then not that much . 
  thus far i still feel pretty confident that we must address questions regarding the compatibility of immigrants and our civilization : in an individual level , can an incoming immigrant fully integrate within our social norms and culture ? 
  if the answer is no , then he should not remain in here . 
  it 's very simple : integrate within our european communities , or you will face the due discrimination because * you do n't bloody integrate * as you are expected to . 
  also , how damn rude are you to call americans `` our less evolved cousins over the pond '' ?
