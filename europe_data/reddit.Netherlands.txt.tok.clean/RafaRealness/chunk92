  not to mention how that makes you sound like a huge hypocrite too ... `` oh * americans are less evolved and less sophisticated ! '', 
  * `` we 've gone full american , we are starting to discriminate people !, 
  we need to stop !, 
  ** preach to these ungodly gravy-covered heathens and cleanse their schnitzel of sin **, 
  in my university we sorta call him `` the cheeto '' as a joke . 
  i do n't really think we call him anything aside from `` trump '' or `` the us president '' . 
   be comfortable about my income safety that wo n't be an issue at all in all of europe i believe , though it depends on your job . 
   have less people around/people are nice in general and do n't mind others business this is very subjective , but i 'd say maybe avoid paris , parisians are quite rude . 
   save 1800 euro monthly errr ... you 'll have to be ** very ** well employed then ... 
  this is something far more up to your own arrangement . 
   the country will most likely have some kind of self-employment or enterpreneur residence visa . 
  additionally it is going to shrink a good part of my income due to taxes/social security payments and such . 
  so just something to keep in mind . 
  what taxes do you consider acceptable ? 
  to what extent is it `` too much '' ? 
  for all these points i 'd reccomend the netherlands but keep in mind that there are laws in place that make it more difficult for companies to hire non-eu citizens and so eu citizens are preferred . 
  this , however , considering your line of work , wo n't likely be an issue . 
   french grammar is crazy . 
  ** ptsd flashbacks of all the conjugations **, 
  ... lidl ? 
  i have no clue what country you 're referring to . 
   switzerland , more specifically zurich , would be my # 2 choice . 
  in swiss francs or euros ? 
  it 's going to be impossible for us to help you if we do n't know where you 're going . 
  each country ( arguably each * region * ) has its own way of life and different elements that constitute its beauty . 
  i 've never actually saw someone wearing those , maybe i did n't pay attention ; i think it 's mainly just to look good , and hold that casual-wear american style outfits i see ever so often right now ( seems to be very en vogue ) . 
  no need at all to be sorry !, 
  i 'm now kinda wondering just to what extent i sound foreign when i speak spanish , because i have a friend who just says spanish words with a 100 % portuguese accent . 
  yeah , you 're right , there 's a slight difference between the two , though i think believe that for the purpose of speaking dutch , both work ( the pronunciation of g depends on some regional distinctions , both are accepted ) . 
  yeah , i think that 's why maybe i do n't fully know what to do to distinguish them , i 'll keep trying though . 
  thanks for the resources , they seem very useful . 
  ooooh , sorry , i thought you were talking about [ \u028f ] , i did n't notice you wrote [ \u0263 ] instead . 
  you 're right , that 's the sound i mean , it 's a bit odd for me because i genuinely can not hear the difference between [ \u0263 ] and [ x ] . 
  i * really * do n't want to live anywhere else than the netherlands , i love it here !, 
  if i ** absolutely ** had to , i think i 'd choose denmark , or luxembourg , austria ... 
  smaller rich countries in the eu basically is what gets me going . 
  no , not at all , i 'm talking about the sound g takes in for example `` gaan '' which sounds like rrrraaaan . 
  it 's a very gruttal r very similar to the spanish j or the french r . the ch , for some odd reason , is * said * by some to be a different sound than g in dutch . 
  the issue with this is that whenever i hear it , i hear absolutely no difference , it all just sounds like what i 'm familiar with : the portuguese hard r. for example , in the word vru ** ch ** t i hear just the exact same in ch as i hear in the g in ** g ** ezondheid in dutch . 
  yes , that 's true , it exists in portuguese too ( if the r is either the first letter of the word , or if it 's rr ) . 
  and french too ( every damn r is so harsh ) though for some reason ( ** and correct me if i 'm wrong ** ) the `` ch '' is not the same sound as `` g '' but i genuinely can not hear any difference . 
  i 'd say a lot of foreigners might also struggle with the gruttal `` g '' sound . 
  i 'm lucky it already existed in my native language ( crisis averted ) . 
  i would n't at all . 
  the uk is , of course , known for british excellence ; it may not seem like a big factor for just anyone but for a lot of people , the uk is a dream mainly for the image it conveys abroad : a beautiful and interesting place of opportunity with its distinct identity . 
  this is also propelled by the considerably big amount of soft power the uk has in the world . 
  next , there 's an easy access to language ; being an english-speaking language in a world where english has become the primary language the international scene works in makes the uk a magnet for people looking for a different , better place . 
  there is also britain 's history with immigration ; by this i mean that the uk already has already a few immigrant communities ; which make the uk more attractive for people who share their cultures as they feel more at home and may even know someone in the uk . 
  not to mention that the uk 's colonial days has left a huge legacy as well as tonnes of visa deals that allow thousands of people into the uk . 
  there is also ease of visas ; british visas , compared to australian ones or american ones , are easier to manage and to obtain , again making the uk a good choice . 
  last but not least , there is also employment ; i 'd argue this is a double-edged sword based on my friends ' experiences in the uk : it is quite easy to find employment in the uk if genuinely you look for it and are willing to do a considerably low-end job . 
  the thing is , i 'd argue that a lot of times these jobs are very bad and in the netherlands they would not pass ( for instance , my danish friend is working in the restaurant industry , and he 's pretty shocked how poor hygiene standards are , as well as overworking with no pay , etc. . . due to either ignorance of safety regulations and workers ' rights or genuinely not caring for following them ) standards of living , great education , etc. . . are the obvious ones and i 'm fairly sure you know these already . 
  it is probable that * before * reforms were made to allow residency to all eu citizens , you can have done this on the basis that they do not hold a job in sweden . 
  this generated tonnes of problems back then , since if you work for a romanian company but live in sweden , under some circumstances you do not work in sweden . 
  plus anyone without a job could be deported easily , thus rendering access to social benefits whilst you find a new occupation entirely useless . 
  not to mention the hassle if you * were n't * a worker but still would like to reside abroad . 
  i 've lived in the netherlands for a whole year now , and i 've asked about this . 
  you do not need to have that in the least , i merely pay my bills and that 's that . 
  health coverage is already a thing thanks to the ehic and if you do n't have one you always can contact your national government to be reimbursed under your national system . 
  what you ** do ** need is a registered residency , which basically is having a housing contract and being in the municipal records of your place of residency . 
   currently the eu has bigger issues such as anti-gay merkel , pro-russian macron of the fact that with the uk leaving we 're now supposedly led by a country who had literally hitler as a leader gay marriage passed the parliament after merkel allowed it to be proposed this year . 
  macron is * very * anti-russia , especially with his recent statements on ukraine . 
  also , you really want to bring up hilter into this ? 
  also ignoring how exactly he has achieved a majority in his time ? 
  not to mention , how exactly are we led by germany ? 
  this is probably the most stereotypical argument ever ... 
  i have read some poor arguments but these are just straight up ignoring facts and saying the entire opposite . 
  you do , but not obligatory via work . 
  obviously if i just go to sweden and have no means of paying rent or anything , i 'll be sent back . 
  however there is * no * legal obligation of holding nor a pension nor an employment in order to reside in another country . 
  if you happen to have money , you can live anywhere , if you happen to just move in with someone abroad and become a housewive you can , etc. . . 
  there 's been a court case against the deportation of a german national from the uk on the basis that he lost his job . 
  the tfeu is very clear on the matter : * any * eu citizen has the right of residency in * any * eu member state , regardless of how the citizen wishes to arrange it ( financially ) . 
   horrible or not , remember that freedom of movement only really applies if you work . 
  otherwise , you might be sent home . 
  this is a lie . 
  freedom of movement also applies to residency rights even if you * do n't * work . 
  hence why eu students are fully free to study in other eu countries on the same basis as national students ; and retired people can freely reside anywhere in the eu without any need for an employment . 
  at first the right was dependent on employment status , but after a few reiterations of some articles in the tfeu , now all eu citizens can reside wherever they would like . 
  ** oh of fucking course a finn beat me to my joke **, 
  not really , no . 
  in theory , you * somewhat * can access the social benefits of another country but every country in the eu will * not * grant you shit unless you fully live there , and for unemployment funds or most types of welfare you must have worked for quite some time there . 
  basically you must have fully immigrated there , worked for a few years , contributed in taxes , in order to get any benefit . 
  also , keep in mind that the uk , compared to other eu countries ( denmark , finland , etc. . . ) is * far * less generous in terms of benefits , so i doubt this is a very big attracting element to uk immigration ( there are other factors that make the uk * very * attractive though ) . 
  this is precisely what i mean , what 's the whole joke about cocos not being spices ? 
  there is absolutely no match for ... * ahem * in the toooooown where i was booooorn lived a maaaan who sailed to seeeaaaa and he toooold us of his liiiiife in the laaand of submariiiiines so we saaailed up to the suuuun 'till we foooound a sea of greeeen and we liiiived beneath the waaaves in our yeeellooow submariiiine ** weee aaall liiive in the yellow submarine , the yellow submarine , yellow submarine **, 
  and every summer after that . 
  every goddamn party has that song `` as a joke '' now . 
  i got relatives in portugal , france , the uk , and spain . 
  i 'm the first one of my family to live in the netherlands , woop !, 
  i 'm franco-portuguese in the netherlands . 
  for france , i mainly hear `` macron seems nice '' or `` man , parisians are really mean , what gives ? '', 
  but nothing really that big . 
  for portugal , it 's radio silence . 
  i swear that aside from being a holiday destination portugal does n't exist in the mind of the dutch at times . 
  and to be honest , i kinda like it this way ; they have no stereotype of me and just treat me more easily like an average tijn or willem . 
  apparently it 's a running meme joke revolving around the voc and such . 
  can you explain to me wtf is up with `` kokosnoten zijn geen specerijen '' ? 
  seriously wtf is up with that ? 
  very nice place , seems great for a holiday and it has a very interesting culture .
