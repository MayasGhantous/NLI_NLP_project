  native hawaiians are * hot * , but like , really damn ** hot ** . 
  bit too full of tourism it seems , but yeah , still , lovely place !, 
  ** although they ruined pizza **, 
  yep , got a whole * video * of it . 
  [ here 's a popular one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk4wsq0buf0 ), 
  i have n't noticed it happening ; i see that * dumb * questions are downvoted , which from my perspective are asked equally in quantity by americans and any others . 
  i think that sometimes , however , you genuinely get a good question , but it 's something that has been asked before , thus maybe prompting users to downvote it . 
  ** [ stille willem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn1pau0awk8&amp;t=54s ) ** / s, 
  i live in a tiny apartment with a bathroom , a kitchen , and a living room/bedroom . 
  it 's a recycled shipping container student housing campus , it 's cheap and utterly lovely . 
  it was built from 2012 to 2016 !, 
  i live as far away from my university as can be in amsterdam . 
  i live in zuidoost , and my university is in centrum . 
  holy shit , i just checked , you 're right . 
  ** my life is a lie **, 
  phillips , the cd , bluetooth , hema , tonnes of economics theories and mathematics ... 
  this is just for the netherlands , and there are many more that i do n't even know yet . 
  every country contributed a * lot * to the world and it 's pretty cool to find out . 
  i would like to have this for the netherlands , yes . 
  my wish seems very much nearly granted as there is very little in practical terms that the netherlands does n't already form a part of within the eu , so i 'm very happy with where my country is in the eu . 
  my pleasure , eesti burger, 
  well , burger * is * the word for citizen in both dutch and german , unless someone is stateless , they are a burger . 
  guess what people from hamburg are called . 
  in my favorite movie , there 's a line that even starts a speech with `` liebe burgerinen , liebe burger der deutsche demokratische republik '' ( dear ( female ) burgers , dear ( male ) burgers of the german democratic republic , excuse any misspelling , german is hard ! ), 
  thanks for explaining !, 
  i grew up abroad , i never knew videoland until mid 2016 , hehe ... 
  i 've heard that the real estate market in sweden is still * very * highly regulated , and even there 's a waiting list to get an apartment in stockholm due to artificially low prices . 
  is this true ? 
  does this system not pose too much of a burden ? 
   however , i 'm not really a fan of the deregulation of vehicle inspections . 
  not because i do n't trust the private companies ( they still need to be accredited ) , but because it 's damn annoying looking through all the different companies homepages for a free time slot . 
  would you be in favor for a somewhat `` middleman '' service where you just go onto * one * website and immediately have all options available ? 
  seems like something that could be done . 
  i 've noticed how digital and faster everything became . 
  as a kid i used casettes , then dvd came around , quickly blockbuster even stopped existing , netflix came about . 
  meanwhile people use less and less bank notes and more plastic cards , or even now their phones . 
  speaking of phones , now they have so little buttons , and are so blazingly fast compared to what they were just 5 years ago . 
  technology has been very fast growing and evolving , and in a way i 'm very glad i got to grow up with it . 
  what do you think about it ? 
  is it for the best ? 
  oh you poor sod , i go to centrum a * lot * ( nearly every day ) and i have to say that the tourists make it a little bit undesirable to be there ; it 's packed with them , and ** fucks sake can they stop taking selfies on every fucking bridge and let people pass ** . 
  at least you 're right , it 's amazingly beautiful anywhere you look , it looks * just * like a real-life postcard . 
  yes , i never said the contrary . 
  the scottish , welsh , english , and irish are * not * one nation , they are a group of nations that are in the same country : the united kingdom . 
  we can not be the same nation , we * can * be the same country , just check the other comments i made to someone else who posted * exactly * what you just said in this thread . 
  you know what caralho means , do n't you ? 
   what country are you from ? 
  i 'm a franco-portuguese citizen living in the netherlands . 
   what do you like about your healthcare system ? 
  best one i could hope for , it has issues but i have yet to find better . 
   how is it paid for ? 
  i pay a monthly fee ( very affordable usually , some also can choose to pay per year ) , and get this amount called `` eigen risico '' . 
  let 's say my eigen risico is 350 $ , this means that anything that costs * less * than 350 $ i will have my insurance pay for it , no questions asked . 
  if something costs more , i will pay 350 $ to my insurance company , and they will pay the full sum of the treatment . 
  keep in mind that * anyone * who wishes to work in the netherlands is required by law to have health coverage !, 
  the government has this annual set of lists called the `` tariefbeschikking '' ( tariff decision ) made by the nederlandse zorgautoriteit ( dutch health authority ) . 
  these lists include prices for * everything * in the medical world ; there is one for dentists , one for reflexologists , etc. . . 
  these are the prices you usually pay at any practice you go to if they follow them ( unless they have their * own * prices , should they be a private one ) . 
   is it efficient ? 
  cost effective , mortality rates , etc are my parameters for this question it is considered one of the best ( if not * the * best ) in the world ; so i 'd say it 's very effective . 
   are you satisfied with your healthcare ? 
  i 'm very satisfied with it ; although i think that maybe it could be better when it comes to taking care of old people . 
   are there private providers ? 
  yep , there are , they are usually * very * expensive . 
   any personal anecdotes ? 
  i woke up with a terrible tooth ache one day , so i grabbed my passport , my info etc. . . and just went into a dentist 's office nearby . 
  they just asked me for my bsn ( burgerservicenummer , citizen service number ) to access my healthcare plan . 
  then they told me to fill out a form and whatnot and wait . 
  i did n't have a dutch insurance yet , keep this in mind !, 
  ( i 'm a student , and i did n't work back then , so not a lot of pressure to get one ) i went there , had a consultation , a few days later i had another one , and now i 'm fully fine again . 
  at the end of each visit i paid the due sum of the treatment as per the tariefbeschikking and they gave me papers proving i spent this money on medical procedures . 
  i then went back to portugal , contacted the appropriate authorities , and got my money back since i am a portuguese citizen and would not have paid if it were in portugal since i was covered there . 
  keep in mind that , for the amount of work i needed , it was * very * affordable and the quality of the service as well as the speed definitely left a very good impression of the dutch system to me . 
  an affordable , fast , and easy solution to health issues . 
   what could be improved in the system ? 
  from what i understand , pensioners , who need health coverage the most , are a bit screwed since they would benefit from more expensive coverage programmes but due to the fact that they are * pensioners * they can not afford them , thus putting them in a vicious cycle of need for better coverage in order to have a better financial situation . 
  they do n't live in misery , do n't get me wrong , but i believe that perhaps we could rethink the system to allow a bit better coverage for senior citizens . 
   what have you heard about american healthcare ? 
  not much !, 
  as i understand , everything in america is ludicrously expensive , and as a result the poorer americans can not access it , which is a * huge * problem . 
  obama passed a bill making sure that insurance companies would be more accessible to poorer people in america , but ultimately it 's being thrown out the window by the angry cheeto f\u00fchrer . 
   do you have any questions about american healthcare for me ? 
  how does your system work fully ? 
  i find it hard to understand who decides prices , how insurance companies work , etc. . . 
   and lots of coffee . 
  well , it ** is ** suomi ... 
   sometimes i hate spaniards ** sometimes ** ? 
  i 'm terribly sorry but you are about to be banished from the netherlands / s, 
  it 's not very simple in my opinion : we have a love/hate relationship with the us government ; when we cooperate and form meaningful cooperative initiatives obviously we love it , for example nato is highly supported , and we appreciate when the us government motions towards decisions that we consider righteous , such as legalizing gay marriage at a federal level . 
  we * do n't * like the us government when it starts meddling with ours , via but not limited to spying on us or dragging us into useless wars . 
  another part comes from the sheer drama that the government seems to have , especially now that * trump * got elected and we have no damn clue what is going to happen , and all former agreements such as the paris agreement or nato are being brought into question by a man who changes sides more than pancakes on a pan ... 
  i personally really dislike the us government for supporting my country 's dictatorship , and ultimately making my grandparents suffer a lot at the hands of salazar , as well as the wars in the middle east , holding up a system that seems undemocratic to me , etc. . . 
  but i still respect it and would n't really do anything against it , i just will stay in my continent and be happy here . 
  as for the american people , i think there 's no overall opinion over you guys . 
  we like you if we like you * as an individual * and we dislike you if we do ; just like any other human i guess . 
  there * are * some immediate tensions with * some * americans , especially tourists who are too dumb for their own good ( a minority , but still notorious ) , the overly patriotic ones , the religious nutjobs etc. . . but the thing is that i 'm pretty sure you do n't like them either , so yeah . 
  it 's a ** very ** complicated subject , and opinions on the matter can wildly vary depending on who you ask . 
  i watched all of it in 2 days after a friend recommended it to me , i absolutely love the show , it 's very fun and interesting , and it always has interesting twists and themes . 
  not big on the fandom , never really seeked any of it , i just enjoy the show . 
  yes , that 's true , though for that comment that now got removed we were talking about how the netherlands is * one * country , but we have * two * nations living in it ( the dutch , and the frisians ) .
