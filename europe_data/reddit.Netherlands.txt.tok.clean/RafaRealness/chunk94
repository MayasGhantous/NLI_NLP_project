  no worries , happens . 
  i think it would be pretty great if we could become a superstate , but i do n't think there 's enough public support nor enough integration for it within the eu . 
  we * can * unite as one * country * , but we * can not * become * one * nation . 
  again , we can be the same country , but we can not be the same nation , similarly how the dutch and the frisians are * not * the same nation , but are , indeed , part of the same country . 
  being the same country does not at all mean we are the same nation . 
  country and nation are two different things ... 
  we are not one * nation * . 
  the dutch are not germans , the germans are not poles , the poles are not lithuanians , etc. . . we do not have a common culture nor primordial identity ( our * national * identities tend to be the most primordial one , and a european identity takes second place to that very often if at all ), 
  i really like nerdcubed , he 's british and a fun guy to watch video game-related videos of . 
  i really loved his cities skylines let 's play . 
  what do you want instead ? 
  anarcho-capitalism ? 
  no regulations at all ? 
  there is much to be debated regarding these fines but i 've seen children 's books with better arguments than this post ... 
  i live in amsterdam , but in a far-off region from the centre called zuidoost . 
  my favorite thing about it is how quiet and simple life is here ; i feel like nothing is out of my reach and that whatever i want to do i can do in one afternoon . 
  my * least * favorite thing is how many of the immigrant populations here in this region are not very well integrated , some do n't speak dutch , or feel like traffic laws are a mere suggestion ... 
  yeah , you 're right , tintin is amazing . 
  that 3d movie was pretty poor though , tintin for me belongs in the 2d comic strip style . 
  what about gaston lagaffe ? 
  he was my damn childhood hero, 
  really ? 
  ** why did they call themselves that ** i swear it 's like they are n't even hiding they are idiots at times ... 
  cheapest . 
  oddly enough i tend to read much more history about foreign countries , specifically the ex eastern bloc , than my own . 
  in french , to be `` dupe '' ( pronounced d\u00dcp ) means to be stupid/easily fooled . 
  i 'm not going to say much more about my opinion on the matter as i think i 've made my point ... 
  i think that though it was n't that great , the place i was born and grew up in still made me more of the person i am today , so i do n't think i 'd want to change it . 
  this reminds me of ** the absolute best ** joke i 've heard about america : the reason why free refills are the absolute pinnacle of american economy is that it 's actually america 's wealth redistribution system . 
  ** it is such a shite joke but it still makes me giggle like a child goddamnit **, 
  just wait a month and bam , 80 000 $ right there waiting for you !, 
  i think i 'd invest on renewable power for myself as well , sounds like a great idea . 
   though suburbs do n't really exist here like in the us although not * to the extent of the us * i think we definitely have suburbs , we have far richer small residential tiny towns with bigger houses , usually one per household , that somewhat mimics the effect . 
  i 'd imagine it would begin with this : ** listen here you fucking sea-gobbling german snob **, 
  i am very good at learning foreign languages , vector design , and geography . 
  i am very bad at * some * maths , drinking , probably pretty bad at straightening my own hair too . 
  in that case i 'd probably buy myself my dream car ( tesla is bae ) , probably not a boat because those things come riddled with taxes and such . 
  i 'd also buy myself all the tech i want , and clothes i want , etc. . . shopping spree basically . 
  i 'd probably also spend quite a lot of money on donations towards [ link ] ( http://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/ ) , whatever i do n't end up using per month i 'd like to fund them . 
  okay but can i buy stuff like a 3d printer ? 
  or a really overpowered computer ? 
  i 'm trying to understand where the line is between what i can and can not keep afterwards . 
  so i ca n't go on any shopping sprees , nor buy any souvenirs at all , or even keep anything i buy between august 2017-april 2018 ? 
  well , what if i buy myself some companies ? 
  or cash it out ? 
  what exactly counts as `` investing for the future '' in this case ? 
  ** well not for lo - ** oh , it 's a woman , nevermind / s jokes aside , she seems like a lovely lady , no idea about her personality , ah well . 
  travel a bit for a month or two , then start investing a * lot * to make sure i got money to last me for another few years , perhaps take up some education to make myself better for the labor market again , pay the everlasting shit out of all my bills and fees , and last but not least go on my dream shopping spree for electronics . 
  well , i would n't mind at all , seems like a pretty fun idea . 
  yep , they should have won eurovision , just sayin ' baltics ftw . 
  well , to say something positive about him ... 
  i learned some romanian because of him , and also learned about romania in general ... ... in a protest against his sneaky bullshit . 
  there also was this [ georgian song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p6-7rw4xug ) that * i think * got banned from eurovision that sang : we do n't wan na ** put in !, 
  ** the negative mood !, 
  it 's killing the groove !, 
  i just wan na ** shoot in !, 
  ** some disco tonight !, 
  boogie with you !, 
  notice how they discretely have to talk about people coming over and ruining the groove , while also singing about how they love all the europe countries and also ** put in ** . 
  culture = race ? 
  what ? 
  for me , trust is earned . 
  i trust strangers to a very very limited extent regardless of their background , and very slowly i will invest more trust on an individual . 
  culture does n't really influence me , though some things like women 's equality , gay rights , separation of church and state , etc. . . are fundamental to me and i do n't think i can trust a person that much if they are against these values . 
  yeah , i know that the us uses the american dollar ( which is roughly 75 euro cents i think ) ; and canada uses the canadian dollar ( close to the us exchange rate i think , water proof and smells like maple if you scratch the leafs !, 
  ) , and that mexico uses the mexican peso ( * no * idea what currency exchange rate it has compared to the euro ), 
  yes , and as long as this continues to be an active issue , then this should be debated until a solution that puts an end to the problem is found . 
  i believe that a clear and well-designed binding referendum would put the issue to bed : give the citizens of catalonia a final say on the matter . 
  yes , that i agree us definitely part of my issues with the brexit vote ; it was not at all carried out the correct manner from top to bottom . 
  and none are king , not until lizzie dies ( which at this point will * never * happen ), 
  it works the same for e-books , at least for the oba ; however i believe you do n't require a specific app for it , just any software that can read the . epub file format or whichever audio file they dish out . 
  i do n't think at all that * almost all * statements were lies whilst campaigning against the eu . 
  yes there was a lot of misinformation ( like the infamous bus and empty promises ) however i still believe that this non-binding referendum was debated to the extent a * non-binding referendum * should . 
  i also believe that separatist referenda should be binding and also have an undefiable agenda on what will be done and how it will be achieved before it is actually done . 
  for example , if ever there is a referendum on independence for friesland , i believe that there should be a binding referendum that explicitly dictates the conditions and terms of independence for friesland . 
  a non-binding referendum , on the other hand , is quite open for whatever you want to do . 
  the problem of brexit for me is not at all the poor debate that was held , it was the * huge * proportion a ** non-binding referendum that got a 52 % majority ** took . 
  as far as i remember , both scottish independence and brexit were debated ; even if under an environment of constant disinformation on all sides . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by this . 
  [ oh you sweet summer child ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-enjcgv1o ), 
   i feel like referendums should be once in a generation and not repeated till the desired result is obtained like the snp wanted ( and the electorate seemed to disagree with them based on the last election ) . 
  i disagree , i think that * if * there are continued calls for independence ( even * if * they are smaller ) then the matter should be discussed further ; and * if * there is a need for a second referendum , then so be it . 
   i agree there has been a change in circumstances leaving the eu but i do n't get their argument since scotland trades 4x more with the rest of the uk than the eu . 
  so pulling out of the uk would surely be worse from an economic perspective . 
  this is , however , * your personal * opinion on it . 
  it also ignores that what sturgeon said was that she 'd like a referendum to be held once brexit terms are known but before brexit actually happens so scotland can decide what they wish . 
   i also do n't get how `` scotland should be independent since they do n't get the government they want '' . 
  so any subnational entity can be independent if they do n't get what they voted for ? 
  in any case , they are now effectively propping up the ruling tories who could n't have gotten a `` single-deal '' majority without gains in scotland recently . 
  well , from my perspective , it seems that the uk has been scapegoating scotland quite a bit , and there is * some * political tensions as well as socioeconomic differences . 
  scotland seems to be different from england and if one side wants to leave , i think it should be discussed . 
   the whole idea of independence seems to be throwing the baby out with the bath water . 
  scots hate the tories and the inequality etc. 
  so independence is an opportunity to `` escape '' . 
  it 's the same things most young people in england hate and i wish we could work together to change it and not just split up and make both resulting countries weaker . 
  the snp have an easy scapegoat in westminster for any problems so independence is ( or was ) an easy vote-winner . 
  it 's like ukip vs the eu parliament . 
  i agree that there should be far more willingness to fix the uk 's overall status in general , but the way i see it , scotland merely ca n't help it since it is so small and tiny compared to england ; thus if england wo n't push for changes at even just half the rate scotland wants , then chances are there will be dissatisfaction . 
   finally , what if the result in a referendum is 51:49 . 
  it 's going to be shit for everyone like the eu ref result .
