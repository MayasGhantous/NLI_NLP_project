  the remainders will be pissed off , the leavers will argue over what they voted for . 
  the result for massive constitutional change ( like the eu one ) could just be due to arbitrary fluctuation of opinion as per polls on the date and based on lies from tabloids . 
  maybe require 2/3rds vote to ensure there is concrete support ? 
  i wish this was the case for the eu ref . 
  i agree with you on this , i think that there should always be a qualified majority over * binding * referenda . 
  plus i believe that this referendum should be binding ** but only ** to the proposed plan for scottish independence ( nothing like a non-binding referendum on something that has n't been fully decided yet like brexit was ) . 
  non-binding referenda with vague ideas should not take place for such a big geopolitcal decision . 
   i know people here love the idea of scottish independence so prepared for the downvotes !, 
  dude , do n't call out the downvotes , that way you * fully * get downvoted , rules of reddit . 
  * yep , goes to show that only the netherlands has european kings that are also pilots , even by province !, 
  i 've heard of independence movements and of movements to become a part of portugal instead . 
  i think both ( especially the second one ) are extremely small in numbers , for context , the party that wants this holds 6 out of the 75 seats in the galician parliament ( bng , bloque nacionalista galego ) , thus being the smallest party in parliament , and * even then * they do n't call themselves at all an independence-party but still have * some * elements within it that defend an independent galicia . 
  i believe they should carefully be debated and * always * rely on a democratic process to make a final decision . 
  fuck spain for not wanting catalonia to have a referendum , and i * dare * the uk to try and block scotland 's ( should there be a new one ) . 
  i do n't , however , support any movements that will rely on violent methods to meet these goals ( like the eta ) . 
  exactly !, 
  also , i feel * far * more comfortable saying what i really think , than trying to be polite and not hurt anybody . 
  the dutch are thick skinned , pragmatic , and honest , and that 's something i absolutely love about 'em . 
  i actually really like it . 
  it makes me feel like dutch people ( or generally people who do that ) are less likely to lie to me , and will tell me what 's what when i need to hear it . 
  honesty is a great asset in my books , even if sometimes it hurts . 
  yeah , other countries are n't * worthy * of having kings . 
  ** a king **, 
  can anyone 's king pilot a plane ? 
  ** i think the fuck not ** nederland is de kampioen . 
  i think in that case it 's * very * variable . 
  as a rule of thumb : never do it unless explicitly said you can and should do it , or if you actually * live * in the house . 
  well , the power and might of finnish ice hockey fans might as well be mythological at this point . 
  ... i have no idea what the heck you mean by this question . 
  in the netherlands , as part of schengen , anyone from schengen ( plus the rest of the eu ) can come over with no problems . 
  there are also visa-less travel agreements with other countries too , like recently ukraine . 
  in a house , anyone can ring your doorbell so i 'm not sure what you mean ? 
  i guess the authorities can come in without notification should they have a warrant for anything . 
  and if you mean what is socially acceptable , i 'd say it 's up to an individual to sorta figure that out ; i do n't think there 's really a general rule about it . 
  for me i best be goddamn notified , please do n't show up at my house without at least a 10 minute warning . 
  ** hissssssssss ** i seriously have a huge dislike for that . 
  i do not give two shits where you were born , if you are a dutch citizen and want to be treated as such you * must * speak the language , uphold the dutch values , and truly be a part of dutch society . 
  in the netherlands this tends to happen with people from mena who * do * get crap about it quite often , but for me i think the same for * anyone * who wants to be treated as a citizen yet is n't even bothered to learn the goddamn language . 
  for me citizenship of a country is an honor , and should be taken with more humility and respect towards that country that accepts and protects you . 
  edit : to be clear though , this is * not * the general opinion of the netherlands , this is my personal view about it and i * think * i 'd be a minority if we did a poll here about it . 
  oh , it 's that time of the year again ... 
  allow me to be * that * dick that says : ** i thought these requests for random pictures were done but apparently not ** if you want to get her something romantic why are you doing something ** tonnes ** of equally repetitive people have already done ? 
  with little to no effort nor thoughts on your part ? 
  the idea is extremely overused , and last time it was a thing it spammed the everlasting shit out of the subreddit . 
  * please * come up with something yourself for ngiongi that actually means something * personally * , do n't just restart a pretty bullshit trend that tends to spam the crap out of reddit . 
  ** dub-fukken-cek ** i really admire his pushes for a better czechoslovakia , and also i really appreciate his embrace in the velvet revolution . 
  * we * created him ? 
  well , then again we created the us basically . 
  i guess so . 
  ... i can not tell if you were talking about the milk snatcher or the iced cream . 
  is it any good ? 
  talk shit in foreign languages , sing obscure anthems , somehow * not * drink alcohol , and generally being a danger to myself and others . 
  ... i can hear the finns coming * oh fuck *, 
  i 'd say it is very very low . 
  nearly all of our food involves dairy products , and i only ever met one person who had this issue with it . 
  in my school in portugal i 've met * one * gypsy dude ( who i did n't know was one , he told me in secret ) who was absolutely normal and average ; the sole thing is that the rest of his family clearly were not . 
  from what i understand there are gypsies who will not integrate for love or money , and there are gypsies that will do so but will become sorta `` ex-gypsy '' . 
  it 's weird . 
  and here we have the stereotype of self-loathing idiotic americans back ... * fuck 's sake * it is an extremely bad idea since you will * not * be taken into account in humanitarian grounds because ** it is very fucking easy for us to find your shit out ** and are likely to get sent back to america ; but you renounced your citizenship so tough titties for you and your rights . 
  ** the plot thickens **, 
  zeeland , drenthe and overijssel seem to fit the bill . 
  in a europe-wide scale , we have a rich people nature excursion summer & winter camp called norway . 
   tony blair actually thought he was n't toxic this is it , the point that i could n't contain my laughter anymore . 
  i actually really liked your writing , and i had no idea that the milk snatcher thatcher was behind an iced cream brand !, 
  i believe that between serbian and croatian specifically there is quite a bit of a history : in the 60s there was even a whole civil revolution to accept croatian as an official language of yugoslavia ; but it was considered to be the same as serbian , just a different dialect . 
  apparently in the `` serbocroat '' language ( that 's what my uni calls it at least ) there are two main dialects , and the most noticeable difference is that one is spelled with the latin alphabet ( croatian ) and one is spelled with the cyrillic alphabet ( serbian , though sometimes the latin is used too nowadays ) . 
  they are mutually interchangeable ( some vocabulary , however , is different , like \u0161takor / pacov . 
  serbian and croatian come from the shtokavian dialect of what is called `` serbocroat '' ( hope i spelled that correctly ) and are thus much more close than others . 
  for bosnian i * assume * there is the same degree of difference regarding serbian and croatian ; and as for montenegrin i have absolutely no clue . 
  ** keep in mind that all this is just based on some research i did a while back , i do not speak any of these languages **, 
  i did not !, 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  per month in the netherlands , although i 've heard some people talk about * taxes * in years . 
  ** it was my battle cry for basically everything i 've done in france , including * le putain de baccalaur\u00e9at *, 
  `` we zijn nummer \u00e9\u00e9ns de rest is tweedehands iedereen is van de wereld en de wereld is van nederland '' ** i fucking lost it at this **, 
  [ what our anthem should be in case of war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fdezwgomty ), 
  i 'm really interested in both koreas , they are really interesting to me ; both historically before the divison , as well as their cultures , divergences , and language . 
  it 's a really interesting peninsula , and i hope i can visit both sides one day . 
  i agree with you , however i do n't agree that * all * politicians are like that . 
  i think we have some exceptions like geert wilders who , to me , clearly does not want to make the netherlands that great considering he could not be bothered to give us a better party manifesto that surpasses * one page * . 
  he also actively tries to bend the rules of our state quite often , he 's both the member of the pvv as well as the ceo of the charity that is the second required member ... seriously ? 
  i really do n't like some other political parties like the \u00fcber christians , but at least i still fully agree that they have the same aspirations to make the netherlands even better , just in a different way . 
  in my opinion it should still be up to the individual countries to have their own system ; and anyone admitted any rights into the schengen space has the right to freely travel within it , but * not * to reside , study , nor work in any member state other than the one he holds a visa for . 
  ( also applicable for admitted asylum seekers ) . 
  i also believe that within schengen , we should have a * common * guard of external borders , meaning that it would no longer be an individual member 's responsibility to protect whichever external border it has , but * all * of us would be made responsible . 
  thus all member states would be legally bound and cooperate to help protect the external borders equally , be it greece , spain , or the baltics . 
  * if * there is a significant push towards a unified immigration system , then i believe that it should be made progressively and slowly , firstly harmonize all our systems to make sure it works out for every member state , and then propose one common system that needs to be accepted by all member states ( or grant opt-outs for countries who do not want to do so ) . 
  i feel very strongly connected to it , maybe because i 'm a history fanatic and the eu truly is an unprecedented marvel on its own right , and also because it has allowed me and my family to live far better lives . 
  i know it has flaws , but i still feel connected to it and want it to keep slowly progressing . 
  thanks !, 
  i love the netherlands , probably more than any other country , though for me the disadvantages are still present : price : the netherlands is * very * expensive to live in , often at times without any particular reason other than the boogy laws of supply and demand healthcare : i would prefer to have a system like the portuguese one , where older people and students alike are better taken care of , and where insurance is not such a hefty expense . 
  weather : yeah , summers are way too hot without enough wind , and a lot of people apparently get depressed on other seasons due to its overall greyness ( though i personally like it ) those are some of the aspects i think the netherlands has as disadvantages , but keep in mind that they are subjective , and in my opinion , the * advantages * of the netherlands greatly overshadow these and make the netherlands an incredible place to live . 
  okay , so basically millennials who * do * see a problem are wrong then ? 
  because they complain when you do n't ? 
  you just seem extremely closed-minded . 
  you said to `` quit complaining '' unless there is a famine , nuclear fallout , lack of shelter , or war . 
  so basically everyone else is doing just fine and has no rights to complaining ? 
  your sister got shot in a school shooting ? 
  quit bitching !, 
  there are people in palestine getting shot every day !,
