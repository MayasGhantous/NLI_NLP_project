  ca n't afford education and do n't want to end up just flipping burgers all your life ? 
  quit bitching !, 
  some people have to have radiation protection . 
  quit bitching ^ tm , the solution to all your problems !, 
  by your logic only the most desolate and extreme cases of poverty are worthy of an actual complaint , nobody else can feel disenchanted ? 
  nobody else can aspire to more ? 
  because * someone else * has it worse ? 
  * the fuck ? 
  i cackled oh my god . 
  [ very true , at least we 're not denmark ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/-/media/imported/images/2007/18/e2187g1.gif?la=en-gb&amp;hash=70f727fd3bad544d97b42bcebb213001d7c1de40 ), 
  all i * really * advise you do is visit it first . 
  and not just in tourism , visit people 's everyday life , talk to them , ask about their struggles , what the country is and what the country is n't . 
  * god fucking knows * i should have done that for france , fucking hell . 
  thanks for your input , it 's much appreciated !, 
  nah , it means `` the american situation '' which considering the cheeto f\u00fchrer is in office ... yeah . 
  there are some bad things about the netherlands , though i think that the pros * severely * outweigh the cons . 
  but that is subjective . 
  remember to also look at eastern europe , some places there are absolutely great , like krakow , or praha , or bratislava . 
  they often go overlooked !, 
  that 's all very interesting . 
  thanks for explaining it !, 
  just one last question : what do you think are the steps that the us needs to take in order to make racial discussion less toxic , and bring about more social cohesion and diffuse tensions ? 
  my first move was uncalculated and rushed , i moved to france without a clue what i was gon na do . 
  that was a mistake . 
  it went very well in practice because i never wanted to return to portugal because of my bleak future there , so i did really well in school , but i had to deal with discrimination , which i never really felt before , in france ; still i am very grateful to france , for having me and given me the opportunities it has , even for granting me french citizenship . 
  it was hard but it was still a very good overall thing to happen . 
  my move to france taught me to always be mindful and thoughtful , it also put me in the oib programme which allowed me to go to uni abroad far more easily . 
  my first choice was denmark but i fucked up my own application and thus it was just not meant to be ; i cried for a few hours and then i applied for the netherlands and was accepted . 
  ever since i moved here i 've never really felt more at home , and i do n't feel like an alien on any accounts , i feel not only welcome here but part of it all . 
  so i think it was the best possible decision for me to come here , and i do n't think there 's anything that will convince me to move again . 
  well , think about it . 
  i moved out twice because of similar reasons ( wanting more than i was getting , escape the mess and give myself a brighter future ) , and trust me that it 's quite a heavy decision , especially the destination and your plans . 
  keep in mind that there are no right or wrong answers , just be responsible . 
  hope to see you soon in the continental side !, 
  in portugal i was taught extensively about the horrors we 've caused there , especially concerning torture and whatnot . 
  i also studied quite a lot about how they were developed and contributed to the economy of portugal . 
  i was taught quite a bit about the wars for independence in the 70s but i think i should have been taught more about it . 
  in france i was taught more about the algerian wars than anything else , there really was n't a big discussion on colonies , just knowing which one was which as well as why they saw it as a problem . 
  keep in mind that i did n't do all my school years in france , just the last 4 of them , and also i was in an oib course which mixes uk content in it . 
  and for the netherlands , i did n't go to high school here , so i ca n't really say ; although the indonesian war seems to be very en vogue right now . 
   left the blacks as second-class citizens what did this mean in practical terms ? 
  was there a situation with discrimination like the apartheid or something else ? 
  where do you want to go ? 
  what are your expectations ? 
  north koreans really have it all do n't they ? 
  nor do the chinese , or brazillans , or algerians . 
  everyone 's so damn perfect and should forcefully be cheerful , right ? 
  fits right in with what apparently you consider complaint-worthy . 
  i think you 're right , especially to understand the racial tensions in america . 
  i probably should look more into it all , really . 
  i see my future as not ideal , there will be definitely some struggles and some concessions to be made to the dream life i want ; but overall i 'm very confident and happy . 
  i feel like i am very capable of leading a comfortable life here , with a nice job , security , health , and education . 
  i can get a nice house , maybe raise a family , or save up for something , i do n't know what my life will be . 
  but i feel like i 'm going to struggle , and things are going to suck sometimes , but overall , i 'll be happy here . 
  i used to have a depressingly bad view of the future in portugal and france where i previously lived , especially because i was dealing with a lot of personal issues as well as societal issues . 
  the netherlands was the first country i 've lived in where i automatically felt like if i put in the work i can succeed in life , and truly have that dream life i 've wanted . 
  i wo n't be rich , or famous , or whatever , but just knowing that i can have a decent , normal life is enough for me to already feel happy . 
  tl ; dr : yeah things suck a bit here and there , there are sacrifices , but overall i 'm optimistic for my future here , even if it 's not perfect . 
  yes , very much so , especially nyc . 
  sorry , got the two mistaken for some reason , thanks for pointing it out . 
  i 'm not very informed on it , aside from a few documentaries . 
  basically the southeast corner wanted to keep slaves , said `` fuck you '' to the federal us and made the confederation and had a bitchfest about it . 
  lots of slaves ran away to the federal side to be free , abrahan lincoln even blockaded water ports in the confederate side ; and won at the end !, 
  bonus thingy : i think this is when virginia was split , and both capitals ( of the federal us and the confederates ) were very close !, 
  plus , the confederates apparently did n't use at red x flag as their official one !, 
  i personally think it was a very sad war ( brother against brother is fitting after all ) though i am happy for the outcome . 
  i do n't think about it really often , but it seems like an interesting period i guess . 
  *** thank you ***, 
  very good * modern * history , but lacking in older history . 
  i have a really strong interest in it ; especially when it comes to fascism and communism ; i find the whole structures of these countries interesting to study and understand , also helps you understand just how damn good you have it now . 
  not entirely sure why you 're being downvoted , i think you are just asking a fair question . 
  i see a lot of people already explaining why it is relevant in the case of making peace and whatnot , so i am going to focus on why it is important economically . 
  you see , we relied on free-trade before the internal market , and it worked but only to a certain extent , because you could very easily start propping up non-tariff barriers to be protectionist and isolationist ( works well on the short term , but not that well on the long term ) . 
  this made europe consider perhaps having an internal market , a system where all our markets have the same standard regulations to guarantee that your product is in competition with similars from all of the member states ; competition sounds scary but it is definitely needed . 
  by generating a common market ( integrating ) we have successfully made europe a far more competitive player in the global economic scale , something that we could have never done individually . 
  then other problems regarding currency rose up : we have a common market but no common currency , furthermore since we are all in competition and ( west ) germany is so strong economically , a lot of our currencies were dominated by the deutschmark and were costing a lot of money to anyone trying to do business if they ever needed another currency . 
  thus came the euro , to answer these issues , which is controlled by all eurozone members , meaning that we are no longer just following germany 's wishes with the deutschmark , and it put an end to high costs and complications regarding currency exchange . 
  i also will say that yes , the euro is deeply flawed and never before was it more visible than in the mid and late 2000s . 
  integration is often a product of an engine : you have a competence you must share , it 's tied and does n't work properly without all others being onboard , so you keep finding these issues and fixing them to secure a smooth functioning of the european institutions . 
  this is how it works . 
  if it is good or bad , that is a very subjective question , and obviously i 'll be very biased . 
  for me it is very good because thus far we are very dependent in some previous integration decisions ( such as formulating a customs union ) and also lacking on others ( incomplete euro design , safety concerns etc. . . ) so i believe that further integration destined to address these issues in a competent manner is the way forward for the eu . 
   justice for belarus !, 
  let 's start with justice * in * belarus , then we 'll see . 
  heheh . 
  yes , to seattle , nyc , and boston . 
  i do n't think so , no . 
  for me the us is already * supremely * a dog-eat-dog case to a pretty bad degree . 
  i 'm actually pretty surprised you 'd ever think that the us does n't have that mentality . 
  as shown by any instance where there is no authority , people are selfish and often heartless , they will naturally want to help themselves as best they can . 
  it 's survival of the fittest really . 
  no worries , just remember : ** reste calme ** ----- ** et ** -------- ** lis le programme **, 
  if my country is not under direct threat that will genuinely hurt it and its people , nothing . 
  so did you , it 's m\u00e9lenchon, 
  if i had to defend it against a real threat , which had a risk of me dying ; i think i 'd do it . 
  alarmingly , it still is , even though it 's written * blatantly * `` coffeeshop '' on every one of them , and there 's google for it too ... 
  * oooooooooh * okay now it 's less confusing . 
  yes , the trip back should be the same exact price as the trip to go , because in the netherlands usually you pay by the distance you travel . 
  here i pay just around 7 $ to go to utrecht and back , which is really nice . 
  i talk to myself about it , out loud .
