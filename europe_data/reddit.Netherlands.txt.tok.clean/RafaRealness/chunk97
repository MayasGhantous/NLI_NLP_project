  i conduct them into something constructive that i can later feel proud i accomplished i go out for an entirely pointless walk to just look at things i 'm very basic i know , but it works for me . 
  trains cost less than by tickets ( tickets are 1 $ extra i believe , plus you ca n't just get in or out you can only leave at your actual destination ) . 
  i 'm unsure still how you had to get * two * single-tickets . 
  yeah , you 're right , hema 's cards are pretty great for travel . 
  well maybe you 're just not that kinky . 
   mountains  denmark i mean ... * how do they think that ? 
  * have you heard about macron , our lord & saviour ? 
  i like the design * a little bit * because it 's different and exciting , and reminds me of macedonia . 
  but i also understand that it has a very bad history behind it , and i think that japan 's current flag is more beautiful ( i love simplicity with a meaning ) . 
  the system works very differently if you have an ov chipkaart ( which i advise anyone who can get one to definitely do so ) where you only pay by distance . 
  i am very uncertain how you ended up paying two singles to begin with , but it is true that the tickets are * not * the cheapest option for anyone at all ; it 's a bit of a tourist trap now that i think about it . 
  well , i think that perhaps it 's alright , as long as these classes remain open in areas that have incoming immigrant populations ( amsterdam being a prime example ) . 
  there 's no real reason for every single place to have them so perhaps it 's a better decision . 
  i was taught american english , then british for one year , then american , then i moved to france and it was all british from there on out , and then i did an oib course which allowed me to choose what english i 'd like to write for all of high school . 
  i live in amsterdam and i think that tourism is * definitely * a con , but in some areas rather than others , centrum is by far the worst place for it , whereas zuidoost is nice and quiet most of the time . 
  i agree that sometimes dutch is not enforced enough , and i think that also this is a bit of a hidden issue in reality for immigrants ( myself included ) : to learn dutch properly ( or any language for that matter ) you * must * practice , and i try actively to speak dutch and do whatever i can in dutch itself ; however because my lacking skills everyone will speak to me in english , thus not giving me much of a practice ( though they are doing it because they are very polite , so i also feel very happy they 'd do that for me ) . 
  not speaking dutch already sets you apart from dutch speakers automatically and puts you aside socially by that mechanism , which i 'm trying to fight by learning dutch so that i can fully merge into dutch society seamlessly . 
  so it 's definitely a very fair point , yes . 
  that 's the thing , i do n't really mind what you call me . 
  french , portuguese , european , etc. . . just use whichever random adjective you prefer . 
  as long as it 's something true , we 're good . 
  yes , i fully agree with what you say , however people genuinely believe that anne frank 's house will provide something as big and impressive as the jewish historic museum but about her . 
  a genuine , big museum with extensive and long halls of knowledge . 
  this is not the case , this is a more intimate exhibit to be in her memory and also show her life as close as possible . 
  so it 's basically a too high expectation of what anne frank 's house is . 
   wanted a sexy french womanizer  went to rural bretagne ** my sides **, 
  i 'd say that if your office supplies are not lisa frank they are garbage / s, 
  i think it 's subjective . 
  it * is * a very important , historical and symbolic place , but a lot of my colleagues felt underwhelmed by it as if focuses primordially on anne frank 's story rather than the whole history of the holocaust . 
  i think it 's perfect the way it is , though i think that the fact that we have to wait in lines that can take up a street and back * or * book months in advance to visit it makes it overrated for the experience it truly is . 
  everyone expects something amazing instead of a more intimate and heartfelt memorial to the history of that poor girl . 
  gratuitous sex and weed galore . 
  also anne frank 's house tends to be * way * overrated, 
  i ca n't have any installation in my house actually , it 's against my lease contract , plus i 'm pretty sure that prices in the netherlands are considerably far higher than prices in slovakia . 
  costing less than a car is n't saying much , plus i also keep in mind that air conditioning is gon na ride up my electric bills up quite a fair lot . 
  i 'm stingy as hell and the wind is free . 
  i have never ever been ever rich enough to afford an air conditioner . 
  ** sad !, 
  ** i usually just open a window and let the air suit my temperature . 
  well , i am from a place called europe , what do you * want * to call me ? 
  i have both french and portuguese nationality , i speak 5 languages , and i move around a lot within the eu , sometimes living north south east or west ... 
  there is a europe , and i live in europe , as a citizen ... should we start by stopping calling you `` germans '' because all bundesl\u00e4nder are different too ? 
  depends , if there are * signed and ratified * commitments to fund projects within those countries where the money goes * to * the government directly ; then there is very little in the way of it . 
  we 've conducted quite a few studies about this in my university , and the case of * how * it 's paid is up for negotiation within the 2-year period . 
  you can pay a large lump and be done or you can pay back slowly but reassuredly ( note that this option requires approval of the eu and a fuck tonne of paperwork , but still is technically an option ) . 
  the case for poorer countries , this can also apply , however keep in mind that most of the eu funding project depends on them actually being in the eu as a legal basis , so during the 2-year negotiations they would receive some money , but it would be very hard to keep receiving anything at all afterwards . 
  there is still a * lot * of speculation , and it obviously depends on what the terms of leaving the eu are for the poorer country in question . 
  leaving the eu is such an unprecedented thing that there is room for a lot . 
  i do n't say aboot instead of about . 
  seen it , kinda grew immune to it by now . 
  i know many women named gina ... oh god . 
  one of them was a huge bitch . 
  sell them to china : ^ ), 
  we like our king . 
  he 's not taken extremely seriously , but it 's a nice tradition that gives more dutchness to the netherlands , and he 's funny which helps out a lot . 
  * join us *, 
  i do too , no worries , fixed that for you . 
  but ... that 's how some people actually speak english here . 
  do n't blame it on us , a lot of teachers force british english to * that * point . 
  nobody is guaranteed a job , i have absolutely no idea where you got that idea from . 
  it 's hard * not * to find work though if you actually search for it since there are lots of houses to be cleaned , toilets to be scrubbed , houses to build , letters to deliver , burgers to flip , etc. . . 
  there are low skilled , uncomfortable jobs that with minimal effort you can get into . 
  earning minimum wage in the netherlands will give you enough money to live a simple , but happy life . 
  you wo n't have the fanciest anything but you can still enjoy yourself to some extent . 
  it 's one of the many things that made me fall in love with the netherlands : it 's hard to fuck up if you genuinely try . 
  it is , but let 's just take a moment to appreciate your username . 
  they are underrated as heck . 
  thank heck , i kinda wonder what political dialogue in poland is traditionally like , if there 's any red lines and such, 
  ( * sshhh , we agreed we 'd keep it in the bedroom < 3 * ), 
  is it kept civil or does it escalate ? 
  i saw two poles on a boat fighting over politics ( they switched to polish when they started throwing rounds but i did understand some colorful insults ) . 
   their accents sounded too british ** is there such a thing !? 
  i 'll think you 're an idiot . 
  just like i think you are a bit of an idiot for asking this question . 
  if your views are such that you worry if people will like you or not then do n't say them . 
  some may agree , some will not , because ** we are all very different people ** and thus will have different opinions of you . 
  there is no rulebook for talking to us , we are the same exact creatures you find in america , it 's just that we live in different countries . 
  some will agree with you , some will not , just like in america . 
  i mean , if you are going to engage in politics , just be ready to have to be mature enough to have people who disagree with you . 
  i get ** mad ** judgements for liking to eat pasta with mayo , and a * lot * of people think i 'm an idiot for a * lot * of reasons ( some probably valid too ) , but the thing is i do n't care and nor should you . 
  i 'm * very * happy here , so it 's very hard to find a specific con that would be meaningful . 
  i 'd say that the weather is often bad . 
  and also our government always takes * way * too long to make a coalition . 
  the biggest con , of course , is to be next to germany ** / s **, 
   2 ) complain about how government/opposition is destroing our country but what happens when a pro-pis pole meets an anti-pis pole ? 
  [ it was ** very ** good for everyone else ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvagssolay4 ) privatization meant subsidies for these companies , plus * very * high prices for british consumers ; but these companies are in part owned by other european governments which then invest the money on our * national * railways that just get cheaper and cheaper ( in the netherlands , you can go from * anywhere * to * anywhere * for 27 $ tops , it 's the most expensive trip ! ), 
  i think that a bit of common sense ( aka do n't ask a german `` so what were the nazis like ? '', 
  and stuff like that ) entirely fixes that . 
  social norms i fully understand like where to bike , if you tip or not , etc. . . 
  but * how to have a conversation ? 
  i will say it for once and for all : ** just be your fucking self and stop asking us for advice on conversations , we are humans just like you . 
  if we like you we like you there is absolutely no damn book to how to talk to europeans ** with that said , just be yourself . 
  if you want to talk , talk , if not , just do n't . 
  not speaking the native language to at least a c1-level nor being an eu citizen will make you harder to hire . 
  specially if you intend on working for the public sector . 
  i would seek a job at a multinational company that requires people skills in international relations , but again , not an eu citizen and not able to speak the language puts you at a * huge * disadvantage . 
  i 'm not trying to discourage you , but be prepared for hardships if you intend to move to the eu post brexit . 
  depends on the visa you intend on getting . 
  also , it 's worth mentioning that for the naturalisation process in nl you need to pass a civic test as well as a language test . 
  ** too damn high that 's what ** no , seriously , amsterdam is far too expensive compared to the rest of the netherlands .
