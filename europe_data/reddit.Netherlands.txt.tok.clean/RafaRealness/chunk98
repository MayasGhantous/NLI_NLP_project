  [ amsterdam prices for stuff , also , good tool for most major cities ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/amsterdam ), 
  * that better be a promise * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  probably not much , perhaps a push for a nexit , but nothing that would ever get us close to one . 
  we are * far far far * more dependent on the eu than the uk ever was , and also we already have a very comfortable situation as is without losing any rights to live/work/study elsewhere in the continent . 
  what is there for us to gain if we follow britain 's path ? 
  for other countries , such as greece , with a higher dosage of problems regarding immigration and economics , as well as euroscepticism , maybe this * will * be a huge push towards a grexit . 
  i was taught american english in portugal , then british english in france , and it depended on what teacher i had what year i 'd just get shit . 
  result is : i 'm fucked . 
  you can book it pretty much to the next day or the next month depending where you go . 
  there are practices that have national prices ( like dentists ) and follow them , you can check the price of everything you will need online . 
  expenses can * seem * quite low but keep in mind that it 's cumulative , meaning that you will not just pay * one * thing , you will pay for the collective small parts that compose your entire treatment . 
  then there are others who do not follow those prices and are instead much more expensive , but also much better in terms of availability ( near instant ) and comfort . 
  for me i 'd never go to one because they just seem very overpriced luxurious things nobody really needs , but hey , not my problem . 
  i have no idea what it 'll be like for your own particular case since i 've never heard of that surgery nor am i sure what specialist would perform it , however it is very easy in the netherlands to just call and ask , usually they answer by email as well . 
  yet statistically also more likely to cause problems , even criminal ones . 
  not to mention , most of our lowskilled workforce from abroad comes from the eu ( poland comes to mind ), 
  1 - cnn is an * american * news source 2 - theresa was being slammed for * actually avoiding the victims * and also the general discontempt of how little is being done about the fire . 
  did you even read your own article ? 
  they do n't blame her for the fire ... 
  nobody is ... what is this even ... 
  * what ? 
  i was taught to pronounce it like american english but spell it like british english . 
  ** help me **, 
  there are already free classes for immigrants ( all legal ones , not just eu ones ) to learn dutch . 
  they tend to be very good and informative . 
  low skilled immigrants from the ex colonies ( suriname , indonesia , etc. . . ) tend to integrate * very * well , the same goes for eu migrants . 
  there is not a lot of problems to begin with though sometimes there is a noticeable language barrier but it fades overtime because generally there is no excuse * not * to learn dutch . 
  mena immigrants on the other hand ... 
  nelly furtado has portuguese origins as well . 
  germany , for the last time , you ca n't burn people like that , it 's against the geneva conventions , goddamn . 
  they were both 29 , they tried for about a year before my mom actually got pregnant . 
  oddly enough , i am the * sole * person in my whole entire family not to have any brothers or sisters ( call me spoiled but i like it that way ) and i joke about it saying `` my parents got it right the first time , no need for replacements '', 
  it exists , so it * is * a problem . 
  but it is extremely unlikely and for the most part unheard of , so * relatively * no . 
  that is very true . 
  i hope that the netherlands finally pushes through with the appropriate legislation to stop these problems . 
  helaas the most conservative parties ruin it ... 
  it is still fully legal for a cop to confiscate your weed , though none will because it 's useless . 
  weed is legal to * sell * ( under very strict criteria ) and to own but * not * to produce . 
  the illegal part is growing weed itself , although , again , for practical purposes , the law turns a blind eye to it . 
  so you can own , sell , and buy it ; but technically you can have it confiscated at any time by law enforcing entities and you can not legally produce it . 
  ** south brabant ** / s more seriously i think that linguistically friesland sticks really out . 
  as for * looking * very different , i think that de bijlmer does not at all look what you 'd expect amsterdam to look like ( there is a big contrast between de bijlmer and centrum , for example ), 
  weed is ** not ** legal here . 
  it is tolerated by law , that 's it . 
  it would !, 
  but by about around 10 minutes . 
  plus i 'd also need to * buy * a bike and the appropriate locks , run the risk of it getting stolen , take time every time to park it properly , have to deal with weather whatever may come ... 
  there 's pros and cons , but i will admit that a bike is also super attractive because it 's cheap and there 's less of a chance i 'll be late due to gvb 's antics . 
  i think it 's not most tourists , just * some * tourists who generally create the annoyance . 
  the good tourists are the ones you never see , because you just think they are locals since they are just going about their business quietly and merrily . 
  that is special to centrum ( and yes i absolutely hate the horrid system for garbage collecting it has and how irresponsible some people are with it ) . 
  in nearly all other areas of amsterdam , the problem of trash is not really that relevant , you nearly never see trash anywhere and it genuinely is very clean . 
  the issue is that * as soon as tourists come * because there is just one event in here , suddenly trash ** everywhere ** . 
  i can even share some pictures to illustrate the difference that ** one ** event in the bijlmer arena made in the plaza right next to it . 
  trash is already a problem in the tourist centre , however where i live , and in other non-tourist centre areas , there is not a real issue with it but as soon as tourists come along there is broken glass , plastic , cardboard , sometimes even other substances , all spread on the ground . 
  i think that * slowly * we should debate and see if we want to integrate further , and also * how * we want to integrate . 
  i think a slow and long route towards a federal europe is preferable to me , however i think that we ** are not ** ready for it as there is still way too much to be discussed and solved ( the euro alone is a nightmare that needs a solution for example ) . 
  so i think that ** if ** in the future there is popular support for such a thing and we also got through all our current problems ( and the eventual ones in the future we do n't even know about yet ) then yes , the eu should become a federal state . 
  in amsterdam , there 's quite a few that live near centrum i think , i have no idea how many , although i must say that that part of town has by far the most delicious shoarma i 've ever had . 
  in my region of the city in particular i do n't think there 's any , it 's a poorer part and most of the people here tend to be foreigners from the ex-colonies of the netherlands . 
  i call entire bullshit on that . 
  you had another post removed from this subreddit called `` clubbing at 15 ? 
  '' , you also have a username with ** jb ** on it that does not strike me as particularly something usual for an 18 year old . 
  this mixed with a post history about acne as well as an [ inclusion of your own picture in another subreddit where you do not look 18 at all ] ( https://i.redd.it/s5tvn51wkgpy.jpg ) and also you are working for summer work in vancouver * specifically as a teenager * and also looking for universities with `` chill rules '' ; this , obviously , without mentioning your horrid spelling that makes me assume you are someone far less mature . 
  you are lying right through your teeth . 
  you are a 15 year old girl and we can see right through the bullshit . 
  whilst lots try , none succeeds . 
  this has been a big problem here in amsterdam for quite a while , and nowadays clubs and the police alike are cracking down * hard * on it . 
  this is a problem we 're unfortunately used to in the netherlands and our authorities take absolutely * no * crap about it ; and i seriously doubt german , austrian , italian , etc. . . will take the matter lightly . 
  if she is under your custody you will get into trouble too for * allowing * such behavior . 
  you are literally endangering a minor as well as performing bribery . 
  these are very serious accusations that you will likely face if you attempt this . 
  bottom line is : this is an incredibly poor and irresponsible decision , to go to another country and break the law , and should you still do it you will face serious legal accusations . 
  i prefer finland because i really wan na learn more about its language . 
  i also really like finland for their sauna culture , and if you ever watch hockey with a finn you are 100 % guaranteed to have fun . 
  i do n't know much about iceland , it seems like a really cool country as well , but in my personal opinion i 'd go for finland still . 
  ps : finland and iceland are not really scandinavia , scandinavia is denmark , norway , and sweden . 
  you can talk about fennoscandinavia , or the nordic countries though , which include those + finland and iceland . 
  6kms , around 40 minutes by metro . 
   not the same thing . 
  as i already said , card payments work internationally in the rest of the world . 
  you just expect card payments to work being in a first world rich western european country . 
  i do n't , nor should you . 
  different countries , different rules . 
  be responsible for your own travel arrangements and be informed . 
  i do n't expect to go to spain and just have everything work like it does in the netherlands , a lot of basic things do n't , like tipping or public transports . 
  again : ** be informed **  are you aware that stores elsewhere in the world can afford it ? 
  it 's just the default in most countries !, 
  ing offers it in spain at 0,5 % per transaction to smes ( bigger companies have better deals ) . 
  does not justify making stores that do n't want to do that adopt the system . 
  if the owners primarily cater to locals and most tourists can definitely pay just fine . 
   because it 's money , they are suffering the bad part without enjoing the good part they are not losing money , the tourists still pay or leave . 
  keep in mind that this is not even most tourists , just enough to get on your nerves from time to time . 
  most of them waste your time , go away , come back with cash , buy what they needed , and leave . 
   why should you have the european standard plug , or the european standard voltage , or the european standard currency , or any other world or european standar if you can just work with your own standard just because it 's yours and others can adapt to it for no reason at all but just because it works differently internally ? 
  firstly there was a genuine benefit to the netherlands for the european standard plug because it meant that german , cheaper , products were available to the dutch consumers . 
  the european currency ( which is not even standard in all of the eu but okay ) is an entire messy debate to begin with . 
  there should only be a common standard if all parties benefit from it , but what you propose is have dutch stores adopt a standard that does not seem to benefit them in the least . 
   nobody has become rich by throwing money away ... you can afford going abroad and try your cards first to avoid the fees .
