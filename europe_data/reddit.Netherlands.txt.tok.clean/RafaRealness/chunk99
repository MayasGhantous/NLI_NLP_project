  i 'm so sorry that your aspirations of becoming rich are blocked by our atm fees when you come on a holiday . 
  tragic . 
  bring cash from home . 
  it 's that simple . 
   well , this is one of the things you do n't expect to work in a different way !, 
   and yes ... you can pay by nfc either with the card or with the phone or with whatever ... but not in the netherlads . 
  this does n't solve a shit because the transaction still has to be processed by visa or mastercard . 
  are you saying my euros are not usable in denmark ? 
  but it 's the eu , right ? 
  * there is no excuse for ignorance , if you go abroad just take one damn minute to look up how to pay for your purchases and how not to be a general dick ( something that in amsterdam is painfully important , considering how tourists tend to have no idea how biking works ) . 
   yes , paying fees . 
  do n't go abroad if you can not afford it then . 
  i do n't complain when i need to pay fees to use an atm anywhere else in europe , do i ? 
   again this is the typical thing you do n't expect to work in a different way ... but in spain the id can also be required at any time so we are also used to that ... * then take a little second to look up how payments work here * , again , why is ignorance to be tolerated ? 
   blame the tourists for everything but for this . 
  those annoyances are created by your incomatible banking system . 
  also , stores can choose to accept mastercard and visa and stop being annoying both for you and the tourists . 
  so you 're saying it 's our job to cater to tourists because they are too dumb and uninformed to properly pay ? 
  are you aware that stores may not choose mastercard nor visa because of the costs of those as well ? 
  why should the * local shops * get off their way to cater to * tourists * who are ill-informed ? 
  so again , * tourists * are ill-informed and come unprepared to the netherlands . 
  this is the tourist 's problem , not ours . 
  if you go to a country you go prepared and informed , otherwise just * ask * . 
  furthermore , you can also pay by nfc and most banks have a payment app that replaces the card , thus solving the problem for a lot of people . 
  mastercard is accepted in any atm , and albert heijn even accepts maestro and so do most big stores . 
  * just bring a goddamn id in case you are asked for one * . 
  tourists have a problem with the payments system because they are unprepared to deal with it , thus tourists create the very annoying inconvenience of longer queues and annoyance at a lot of stores ( i 'm trying to pay for a sandwich , 3 people in the line , here comes a tourist who can not pay somehow and does not understand why and suddenly we 're gon na wait a while ) . 
   to be fair amsterdam is planned in a way that just does n't seem to admit that much people ... 
  hence why the waves of tourists who have a general disregard for other people 's needs to get through is an issue . 
  they all go to centrum which is * the * part of amsterdam with that issue , yet other parts like nieuw west , or zuid , or noord , where there is far more space , they never go there ...  you make foreigners life almost impossible for paying ... chipnick is only a thing in the netherlands and in the rest of the world mastercard and visa are widely accepted ( both credit and debit , in the netherlands foreing debit cards are strangely accepted ... foreign credit cards are only accepted by hotels and car rentals ! ) . 
  ** by going to a booth that does not say `` alleen pinnen '' it literally is that simple . 
  ** do n't go to places that do not take cash if you want to pay by cash , do n't use huge bills either . 
  they are rare but still do n't go there if you can avoid them ( usually they do n't even sell anything you ca n't get elsewhere ) you can swipe , nfc , or chip your card in , any way you want when you use the machines . 
  the sole thing with credit cards is that a lot of places merely require id and lo and behold nobody seems to have one . 
  if you come to the netherlands and you * know * that visa and mastercard are not common , take a goddamn ** 20 meter walk to the nearest atm ** and pay by cash , there are loads of atms everywhere ffs . 
  there is no excusing ignorance that just makes shopping a whole more of a hassle for locals than it should be because some tourists can not be bothered to ** read nor follow any goddamn rule **, 
  i do n't speak dutch ( i 'm still actively learning ) . 
  i do n't fully mind it as long as you still do an effort to practice it and learn it . 
  the language of the netherlands is dutch , thus you should at least attempt at learning dutch and * try * to speak dutch , even in small things like doing your groceries , just speak dutch . 
  worth . 
  although i support it as an endgoal , i 'd hate it . 
  we are * not * prepared to federalize , and we need a democratic majority in all member states to do so . 
  fix the issues , generate popular support , then * maybe * propose a federal structure and federalize . 
  we can not rush the european project nor force it to go into directions ( like federalism ) unless we 're all onboard . 
  come visit me , let 's smoke some blunts and stuff . 
  bring me some sorelis or however you spell those delicious milk curd snacks though . 
  not only that , but * always * walk next to each other quite slowly in cramped streets and sidewalks , stop for selfies all the time , and even block entrance to my goddamn university buildings , thus preventing traffic . 
  bridges are chaos because * every single one * needs an uncreative selfie with a canal behind them . 
  then there is also the idiots who just walk with their bags everywhere , especially early in the morning or late at night in quiet streets . 
  because the sidewalk is n't smooth ( it 's bricks ) it generates a lot of noise , and it wakes some of us up . 
  then there is also the tourists who merely * can not * handle their drugs . 
  if i had a euro every goddamn time a high-as-a-kite idiot get in my way or just generally create a mess , i would be able to get myself a much better laptop . 
  also , who the fuck smokes weed in public parks or with kids around ? 
  what in the everlasting fuck ... that is so damn inconsiderate . 
  then also the immature and rude tourists that go to de wallen ( red light district ) and * take photos of the sex workers * which is illegal and extremely rude , even derogatory for me . 
  plus they enter every sex shop just to giggle at plastic dicks and vaginas like the barbarians some of them are . 
  and , finally , there is the payment issues because they merely do not understand that credit cards are uncommon , and paying by cash is not accepted everywhere , nor can they ever be bothered to read the huge signs that say `` hier alleen pinnen '' . 
  ** littering everything ** . 
  not even gon na explain this one . 
  tourists cause tonnes of issues . 
  not all tourists , but goddamn . 
  i live in amsterdam . 
  the immigrants are merely normal , a majority speaks dutch ( not all ) and 99.999 % of them speak english . 
  it feels very normal , everyone obeys the same rules and most dress the same . 
  the * actual * foreigners i believe cause a problem are the tourists , who have no damn idea of how annoying they are ... 
  ** penne !, 
  i love our process already , i feel like we are all fairly represented in the tweede kamer . 
  the thing ( as you can probably tell ) is that there should be a mechanism to speed up or even replace the coalition as it 's forming to make sure we get a competent and capable government more quickly . 
  i 'm from ile-de-france ( lived in multiple places there , both bad and good ) and i am talking about the overall attractiveness of the country . 
  due to the recent political change , since it keeps france a part of the eu and one of the main pushers for further and better integration , france has maintained its status as a very attractive country , however this status was not set any higher due to the fact that practical matters as well as the economic situation has yet to change . 
  france is very attractive , but not more now than ever , just as usual . 
  [ pene ? 
  ] ( http://static.buttalapasta.it/r/845x0/www.buttalapasta.it/img/pasta-alla-carbonara-con-panna.jpg ), 
  i 've lived there , i 've got family there , i speak fluent french , etc. . . and the answer is no . 
  france has become very good * politically * in my opinion ( very happy macron took leadership ) however i believe that the practicalities of living in france have not changed at all , and i still do n't feel like going through that all that hassle just for france since france , in reality , has stood just as attractive as it was once before ( which already is a * lot * , but not everyone has the means nor the wish to do so ) france is * very * attractive , that 's true , but consider that a lot of people can not sustain themselves to realistically move there , or merely do n't want to due to other factors ( like leaving family behind ) . 
   l'internationale  *** c'est la luteuh finaaaleuh ***, 
   ( unless you 're bruno aleixo ) . 
  ** a true national animated treasure **, 
  true , i was merely explaining that it 's not as simple as just adding an s , sometimes you also need to change the suffix . 
  ** penis !, 
   ( the only exception i can think of is some units of measurement named after people . 
  people will say 300 kelvin and not 300 kelvins , even though the latter is technically the correct way , and people actually say it like that for more common units : newtons , watts , joules . ), 
  and also anything ending ( in its singular form ) in - \u00e3o , which gets replaced by - \u00f5es ( often ) in their plural form . 
  na\u00e7\u00e3o becomes na\u00e7\u00f5es , aten\u00e7\u00e3o becomes aten\u00e7\u00f5es , ** but ** c\u00e3o becomes c\u00e3es so there are * some * exceptions to the rule ( mainly monosyllabic words ), 
   fric - etymology says it would mean `` feast '' in english ** le fric , c'est chic ** made a tonne more sense once when i learned french . 
  i 've never heard about des oseilles nor des p\u00e9p\u00e8tes being used for money where i lived there , but it * does * sound like something that would probably be said somewhere . 
   not even will grigg is hot enough for me to turn gay . 
  i might be up for a challenge  / s, 
  flair czechs out, 
   black , no sugar * like my men *, 
  really damn cold lactose-free milk . 
  i 've seen them a lot on tv in france and portugal ( not a lot in the netherlands ) . 
  they * must * be around if you look for it . 
  yes , i agree , and i consider it a vital part of our function . 
  however , when it comes to , say , paying for ambitious different projects that do not directly fit that description ( such as the polish windfarms that operate at a cost ) then there needs to be a review and a removal of added help . 
  when i say eu funding i refer the funding of these projects that sometimes even are cases for embezzlement cases , * not * to the common transfers that are needed to maintain balance within the common market . 
  these funds are distributed more or less equally throughout all of the eu , though for some reason poland happens to have lots of them ( and , as you can guess , a lot of embezzlement cases pending ) . 
   refugees should not choose where to go because if they all go to one country , that country becomes overwhelmed . 
  they are to be relocated and registered in various countries so that when they run to another , authorities will send them back to where they are registered . 
  *** amen .
