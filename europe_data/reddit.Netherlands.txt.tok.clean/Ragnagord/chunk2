  that is about as near to a definition as this much-abused word has come . 
  but fascism is also a political and economic system . 
  why , then , can not we have a clear and generally accepted definition of it ? 
  we shall not get one -- not yet , anyway . 
  to say why would take too long , but basically it is because it is impossible to define fascism satisfactorily without making admissions which neither the fascists themselves , nor the conservatives , nor socialists of any colour , are willing to make . 
  all one can do for the moment is to use the word with a certain amount of circumspection and not , as is usually done , degrade it to the level of a swearword . 
  [ george orwell , * what is fascism ? 
  * , 1944 ] ( http://orwell.ru/library/articles/as_i_please/english/efasc ), 
  bbc was afraid to be accused of being intolerant towards the intolerant . 
  exactly , so there clearly are more factors at play, 
  based on your claim that the islam is the only force at play in syria , yes , but somehow civil war is not what we observe . 
  i failed at ninja editing in the world ` relatively ' . 
  light , comparing it to a civil war . 
  those forces are only active in aceh , a small autonomous region of sumatra . 
  what about the rest of indonesia ? 
  according to you , there should be a civil war going on there : since the islam clashing with other religions is the only factor at play in these attacks , then they should be bashing eachother 's heads in in indonesia , but somehow that 's not happening . 
  only the occasional relatively light violence . 
  how 's that possible ? 
  and clearly the islam is the only factor at play there , that 's also why indonesia , the country with the largest muslim population as well as many people of other religions , is one big warzone right now / s, 
  is it ok if i 'm just somewhere in the center ? 
  of course the big news in the netherlands : [ johan cruijff passed away . 
  ] ( http://www.nu.nl/overlijden-cruijff/4236043/johan-cruijff-68-overleden.html ) ( although he passed away in barcelona . ), 
  but we need to take drastic measures that actually work , rather than what sounds good at first thought . 
  [ that 's literally not even remotely close to what i said . 
  ] ( https://www.universalclass.com/i/course/reading-comprehension-101.htm ) really i can not comprehend how that 's all you read in my comment . 
  it 's almost impressive . 
  i do n't know what you mean by that . 
  i 'm saying that if something is a result of the aftermath , then it 's part of the aftermath , as the aftermath is the collection of resulting situations . 
  saying it 's not a result , but a result of the aftermath is a contradiction . 
  is n't it a bit early for such an agreement ? 
  it 's still just a concept , and nobody even knows how well it will work . 
  that 's exactly what i 'm afraid of . 
  things like building walls and banning encryption and burner phones . 
  i 'm not sure how that 's going to help . 
   aftermath  noun  1 . 
  the consequences or after-effects of a significant unpleasant event it appears you 're contradicting yourself . 
  do you even know what ` fear mongering ' means , or are you just being silly ? 
  fun fact : isis gained foothold in iraq as a result of the usa 's fear mongering . 
  fear mongering is never a good idea , even when there are problems . 
  coming up with reasonable solutions is far more effective than making stupid decisions that sound good to the scared voters . 
  thanks , i missed that part . 
  also a nice read : [ chapter 2 of the same research ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-religion-and-politics/ ) , that he conveniently did n't talk about , as well as all the other chapters . 
  [ this ] ( http://nos.nl/data/image/2015/07/22/177942/xxl.jpg ) is the traditional clothing in spakenburg . 
  it has fallen out of fashion though , there are only ~ 150 women left who still wear it . 
  people have forgotten the troubles already . 
  it has n't even been 20 years, 
  i 'm all for taking in refugees , but if they refuse to integrate into our society and misbehave like this , then they should be put on the first plane back to their own country if you ask me . 
  and no , that 's not a violation of human rights , it 's a violation of our own right to safety to keep them here . 
  ironically , he calls wilders out for calling our parliament a `` fake parliament '' . 
  this situation has nothing to do with the refugee crisis . 
  he gave the speech exactly two years ago , far before the whole refugee situation escalated . 
  well spotted , he made a typo . 
  the phrase `` for all we know '' means as much as `` we ca n't be sure with the current information , but ... is also a possibility '' . 
  this thread has cost me some karma . 
  it 's funny , because 4 in 1000 is not a notable amount , but when you 're talking about a migration of 0.1 % of the european total population it 's suddenly too many . 
  are you seriously suggesting that those thousands of people that died in their attempt to reach europe never died ? 
  because the journey from syria to europe is not exactly safer than staying in a war zone . 
  especially for young children . 
  you 're right , we should be publicly flogging atheists . 
  says the guy that rattled down some factoids with no source whatsoever . 
  anyway , i 'll help you with finding some sources : familiy reunion procedures can take up to two years ^ [ source ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/dijkhoff-gezinshereniging-kan-meer-dan-twee-jaar-duren~a4247458/ ) , which makes the numbers a bit difficult to interpret , but considering these numbers : http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=83102ned&amp;d1=1,3&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=0,37&amp;d5=16,33,50-51&amp;hdr=g2,g1,t,g4&amp;stb=g3&amp;vw=t you can see that on average each refugee ( `` eerste asielverzoeken ( personen ) '' ) brings one family member ( `` nareizigers ( personen ) '' ) one year later . 
  the vast majority of those men are fathers who are searching for a new home for their families , with the intent of letting the women and children they left behind safely travel after them after having made the right arrangements . 
  are you sure a 0.3 % increase of the total population is going to make such a big difference ? 
  well , we ca n't help everyone , but could you explain to me why syrians do have that right and eritreans , iraqi and afghans do n't ? 
  1.2 million on a population of 740 million . 
  makes it all seem so petty . 
  because everything is perfectly fine in eritrea and countless other countries . 
  i have a christian name , and a christian background . 
  i am not a christian . 
  i give them 5 days before ublock circumvents it . 
  in texas a training takes as little as 18 weeks . 
  that 's not even close to a year . 
  just plain old criminals , not necessarily * jihadists . 
   as learned reporter rmf fm , the men were repeatedly been listed by the dutch police - for possession of a firearm , robbery with violence , as well as theft , among other cars . 
  ( via google translate ), 
  and those other media know this because ... ? 
  honestly it 's more likely to be just plain old organized crime . 
  not every arab with a gun is a terrorist . 
   american police , which is specifically trained to police americans if you call a 6 week course a training ... 
  now that i think of it , `` johnson '' and all its variants must be close to the most common surname in europe . 
  groping , sexual intimidation and all other kinds of sexual harassment are sexual assault as well . 
  if you 'd actually read the article , it says that of the 343 complaints in january , 61 of the cases were rape . 
  this is only about rape and attempted rape , not sex attacks in general . 
  you mean apart from the fact that we all would be living in nazi germany ? 
  any source for that ? 
  are n't you confusing this with monthly statistics ? 
  i 'm asking this because [ dutch statistics ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=83032ned&amp;d1=0-5&amp;d2=46&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=l&amp;hdr=g3,t&amp;stb=g2,g1&amp;vw=t ) show numbers similar to austria , and i ca n't imagine denmark being much different . 
  because you can manually turn off safesearch , an option google removed some time ago . 
  now you can only toggle between non-strict and strict mode , and non-strict mode only shows nsfw results based on some `` smart '' ( or rather dumb ) guess of what you 're looking for . 
  the seven united netherlands have been united for quite a few centuries by now , so it can be quite stable . 
  yet on a daily basis americans call themselves american . 
  you 're not less inclined to follow right wing parties , you 're less inclined to follow populists . 
  it 's merely a coincidence that the populists today are right wing . 
  the thing is , all these populist parties and politicians do is say what people want to hear , without offering realistic solutions to the problems they claim they can solve . 
  it 's all about getting votes , rather than actually leading a country . 
  i prefer knowing that smoking is bad for me , so i can prevent getting cancer over being cured of cancer after smoking without knowing it 's bad for me . 
  is n't giving a warning a form of protection ? 
  not really . 
  immigration policies are not going to keep a wave of refugees from fleeing from war . 
  the only way to prevent that is by not causing said war .
