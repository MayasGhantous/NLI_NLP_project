  think about that . 
  you mean like having tattoos in a biker club ? 
  or wearing a leather jacket with a hell 's angels logo ? 
  so you go around naked , then ? 
  and obviously burkini 's are the epitome of islamism . 
  you missed one tiny little detail , though : these attacks are usually made by balkan gangs . 
  europe was built on christianity in the same way that isis is currently building their country on the islam . 
  it 's not really something to be proud of . 
  tunisia and morocco are in the middle east ? 
  i must 've missed the memo . 
  what are you even trying to say ? 
  the devices connected to the internet can not work together on one task in a coordinated way , so no . 
  supercomputers , however , work by chaining many ` standalone ' computers together via a network , and making them capable of working on a task in a coordinated manner . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_july_2005_london_bombings https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_glasgow_international_airport_attack and then there 's the leytonstone station stabbing and a bunch of attempted attacks ... 
  ca n't we get an automoderator rule in here that just bans this phrase ? 
  oh , whoops , i got my own comment removed by linking to pastebin , which apparently is not allowed here , so i 'm hijacking the top reply to it . 
  anyway , here 's a better transcription that i found on twitter :  balcony man : `` you fucking asshole you ... ''  shooter : `` because of you i [ unintelligible ] ... ''  balcony man : `` you cunt you . 
  you 're a cunt ''  shooter : '' ... and now i have to buy a gun to shoot you ''  balcony man : `` a gun fuck off your head is n't on right ''  shooter and balcony man shouting at each other  balcony man apparently to people filming : `` he 's got a gun here the guy has one ''  shooter : `` shit/fucking turks ! '', 
   balcony man : `` shit/fucking kanacken '' ( foreigners basically )  balcony man to someone else : `` ey !, 
  he has loaded his gun !, 
  get the cops here ! '', 
   shooter : `` i am german . '', 
   balcony man : `` you 're a cunt is what you are ''  shooter : `` stop filming ! '', 
   balcony man : `` a cunt is what you are , what the fuck are you doing ? '', 
   shooter : `` yeah what , i was born here ! '', 
   balcony man : `` yeah and what the fuck you think you 're doing ??? '', 
   shooter : `` i grew up here in the hartz 4 ( unemployment benefits in germany ) area . 
   balcony man and shooter talk at same time , ca n't make it out . 
   shooter says something about `` behandlung '' which is `` treatment '' in both medical treatment or just how you treat people , not sure which one he means . 
   balcony man says something like `` yeah treatment is something for you ''  shooter : `` i have n't done anything here for [ unintelligible ] ''  shooter : `` just shut your fucking face man ''  balcony man : `` you cunt you ''  balcony man : `` hey !, 
  he 's on the upper floor here [ unintelligible ] ''  filming man goes into cover , shooter starts firing . 
   balcony man calls him a cunt again . 
   balcony man shouts something at him about `` shooting here '' and shooter replies multiple times `` yeah , that 's where you 're right !, 
  yeah you 're right with that ! '', 
  yeah you 're right ! '', 
   video ends . 
  the servers are messed up , it can take a couple of minutes for comments to appear , maybe that 's what you 're seeing . 
  indeed it 's not a coincidence , because both happened after is gained foothold in syria and iraq . 
  that 's why i said `` supposedly '' , but it 's all the information we have , and i do n't speak german , but there was a video somewhere on twitter where he supposedly said this . 
  also there is rtl reporting :  eyewitness said that suspect shouted `` schei\u00df ausl\u00e4nder '' =  `` damn foreigners '', 
  if you use the word ` flame ' in that context irl then that 's enough reason to assume you 've been in your moms basement for too long . 
  ... and impossible with vegetarian diets . 
  the difference between a steak and a tofu burger is rather obvious . 
  but it 's rather funny that you chose to stick to your opinion while all observational evidence points in the opposite direction , and then proceed to call dietology a religion . 
  also , the risk of coronary artery disease ( the leading cause of death as of 2013 ) is not exactly what i 'd call `` vanishingly small '' . 
   second paper actually agrees completely with what i in hindsight really meant to say but did n't because it really was n't what i meant to say at all . 
  ftfy, 
  sure , who cares about proper scientific research , if you can just dismiss it with some silly rambling about dieticians . 
  also be sure to read those other 2 articles . 
  make that a yes : http://www.andjrnl.org/article/s0002-8223 ( 09 ) 00700-7 / abstract https://foodethics.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/p_foodethik/mcevoy__c._2012___vegetarian_diets__low-meat_diets_and_health.pdf http://www.karger.com/article/fulltext/337301, 
  from a cultural point of view it 's about as far from the rest of the middle east as you can get . 
  and here we can see a wild putin in his natural habitat , doing a little dance . 
  time to grab our tinfoil hats , the mods are lizard people !, 
  thank you , captain obvious . 
  eu = / = europe, 
  huh , and all this time i thought that whole area northwest of istanbul was part of turkey . 
  really , if we 're going to draw arbitrary lines on the map to support our own narrative , we might as well do it like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/obfc5hm ), 
  and let me guess , mexicans are asians , ethiopia is south american , and china lies in the middle of the antarctic continent . 
  you mean like most heads of state ? 
  and would that have been any different if you were a muslim ? 
  not a true dutchman . 
  that 's like saying there 's no such thing as red balloons because red things are traffic lights . 
  the british nationality , ( i.e. 
  having a british passport ) is something completely different from a british ethnicity ( i.e. 
  scottish , welsh or english ( or irish ? ), 
  ancestry , culture , language , etc. ) . 
  you should read [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_group ) , probably . 
  it 's quite informative on the definition of ethnicity . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-forex-iduskcn0zo038 tl ; dr :  the u.s. currency did rise immediately after the u.s. jobs data , reversing losses against the yen and climbing to two-week highs against the euro and a five-week peak versus the swiss franc . 
  but those gains evaporated and the dollar traded mostly flat on the day . 
  and we western people only identify as western because we 're not muslims . 
  nowadays most muslims are born here . 
  there is no ` back ' . 
  i do n't see how that 's relevant, 
  that does n't make it ` wrong ' . 
  a word is defined by how it 's used , not by its etymology . 
  exactly , if you just ignore the bullies then the bullying stops by itself . 
  your comment makes no sense . 
  what 's there to regret ? 
  they did n't win , their vote did nothing . 
  the fact that half of the voters did n't know what the referendum was about was pretty embarrassing as well . 
   a more or less equal state i do n't mean to ruin your day but france has got their own nukes . 
  [ russell 's teapot , for anyone interested ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russell%27s_teapot ) tl ; dr : '' if i were to suggest that between the earth and mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit , nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided i were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescope . 
  but if i were to go on to say that , since my assertion can not be disproved , it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it , i should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense . '', 
  but the european commission does , who are elected by the parliament . 
   economically disastrous realities which realities ? 
  the ones that reside in eurosceptisists ' fantasies ? 
  that too . 
  but resistance to pesticides allows farmers to use herbicides that would otherwise kill the plant . 
  there are risks inherent to genetically modifying a species to make it more resistant to pesticides . 
  other forms of gmo are mostly harmless . 
  from the faq :  genetically engineering the food we eat is an inherently risky process . 
  * inherently * , in this case , means `` it 's risky because we say it is '' . 
  did you sleep through the orlando shooting ? 
   even most of the time people from netherlands and belgium come to germany for shopping etc. 
  mostly for nonfood , alcohol and tobacco , and those are not included in the op . 
  sure , and let 's implement the sharia while we 're at it . 
  the police officer admitted that typhoon got pulled over solely because he was driving a car that the police officer deemed too expensive for someone with a dark skin . 
  i have a hard time believing that pulling over random people like that helps the police in any way . 
  if anything , it hurts their public image and makes it more difficult to do their job .
