  the two conservative winners in the netherlands , cda and vvd , both used mild populism to draw pvv voters to them . 
  to say populism lost is a big fat lie . 
  groningen was a pvda stronghold and yet the pvda went along with policies that greatly harmed that province . 
  why would they ever vote for the pvda again after being betrayed like that ? 
  party programs are a promise of representation , but when you get to govern and go against said program , you 're asking to be punished by the electorate . 
  that happened . 
  you 're being unreasonable . 
  that 's outright silly talk . 
  the pvda campaigned in 2012 for : reform of the hra and strong social policies with regards to the economy , social security and migration . 
  what pvda voters got was the devastation of the elderly care , a flex-wet that does n't work , no hra reform and a further ` right ` ening of social security and healthcare . 
  in what world is it ` fickle ' to walk away from a party that got 38 ( ! ), 
  seats out of a 150 , ends up governing , and does all of the above ? 
  exactly , it is n't . 
  you 're being selectively facetious and downright silly . 
  seem fickle ? 
  perhaps to the uninformed outsider , but every leftie i know feels betrayed by what the pvda did by opting to rule with the vvd and then selling out completely . 
  you reap what you sow . 
  i honestly doubt that the pvda will recover from this . 
  that 's the dutch way . 
  seems to work for us . 
  hate ? 
  that 's a rather strong word . 
  i do n't think the dutch ` hate ' any nation or people , save for isis and when we play them at a world or euro cup , germany .

  you got me there . 
  i 'm not sure if the average american can handle that much choice , 
  makes you wonder how many of them got an active tumblr blog . . 
  . . but i want to screw the pirate party , in particular the frontrunner . 
  that sounds absolutely terrible . 
  hopefully it wo n't pass , one way or another . 
  this article puts the cart before the horse though , forgetting the fact that the dutch were willing to co-operate with the turkish minister * until * he started acting like an all-purpose dipshit . 
  it was n't all about winning votes , but as the conflict escalated and the notion of a solution became utopian , of course politicians will spin it in their favor with just a week before the elections . 
  that might make it seem like it was all about votes , yet it * was n't * . 
  for the dutch side anyways . 
  breaking news : idiot says idiotic things . 
  more at idiot o'clock . 
  perhaps the kapsalon will evolve and turn into a mix of boerenkool , mashed bitterballen , fries and zaanse mayonaise . 
  actually on second thought , maybe we should hope it does n't evolve . 
  yes !, 
  let us shave the cucumber and export and import glorious tzatziki . 
  laughing the balls right out of his pants , as we say in dutch . 
   i took a stroll through the turkish twittersphere and was amazed at just how much of exactly that type of infantile militarist chauvinism there was . 
  you never knew until now ? 
  oh , child of summer . 
  turks tend to be crazy nationalistic , putting your average american to shame with their nationalist fervor . 
  the way of the caralho . 
  they will halt the export of kebab and garlic sauce to the netherlands . 
  petty people gon na do petty things . 
   they need to take lessons from the vvd in the netherlands . . by doing what , making the courses needed to pass the dutch exam done by third parties for which the immigrant can loan up to 10.000 euros from the government ? 
  by standing behind merkel in the eu while fistbumping along with wilders on the national level ? 
  they are actively frustrating the integration effort while participating in the eu effort of immigrant redistribution . 
  sorry , but they are the party you should look at to see how not to do it . 
  dj paul , jonguh  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ismmziumxyo, 
  die antwoord make rave / hardcore music which , not entirely coincidentally , is exactly the stuff the new kids guys listen to . 
  that , and die antwoord is an act just like new kids ;d, 
  sounds a bit like what i like to call ` english optimism ' , where the englishman enters the pool area with a t-shirt on , gets comfortable and figures ` why not ? ', 
  to then take off said shirt . 
  a few hours later and the englishman realises mistakes were made . 
  but he 'll do it again next year . 
  you touch upon that which makes the discussion of whether to or not exclude him is quite the touchy one . 
  in fact , it has been a thing for years , but not until wilders blew up the one government he ( sort of ) partook in did the right wing parties go from ` maybe ' to ` no ' . 
  every debate is one where other parlementariars ask wilders to explain his plans ( which he refuses / doesnt ) and or explain his ( sometimes vile ) words . 
  he really has called it over himself , but of course he cries wolf . 
  scrap the ` might not be ' . 
  it simply isnt for them . 
   https://www.trouw.nl/groen/vvd-schrapt-zin-over-klimaat-uit-verkiezingsprogramma-na-kritiek-klimaatsceptici~a401a357/ it also lines up with independent checkers ' assesments of the vvds program . 
  you should look up fietsopa . 
  we have the best clownsm the greatest . 
  oh and fietsopa is highly nsfw , but his work is such a beacon of dutch culture that you dont want to miss it . 
  farmers voted for a brexit while they are highly dependent on both eu farming subsidies and cheap foreign labour . 
  a lot of people voted against the establishment to vent their anger . 
  they listened to the unattainable promise of millions going daily to healthcare . 
  their interests , it seems , were playing second fiddle to their emotions . 
  that is definitely what you can call stupid . 
  can you rephrase that question ? 
  what parties are excluding ruling with wilders ? 
  pretty much everyone . 
  why ? 
  an accumulation of the things he has said , things he has done ( others see him as untrustworthy after him co-ruling and causing the cabinet to fall ) and now his political program which seems to be him joining trump 's crazy populist train . 
  if you act like a clown , scream like a clown , you will eventually be treated like a clown . 
  i 'd rather blame people stupidly following wildly populistic loudmouths , but whatever floats your boat . 
  with the vvd 's stance on environment , they might be further away from both d66 and gl than you think . 
  something will have to give . 
   https://www.trouw.nl/groen/vvd-schrapt-zin-over-klimaat-uit-verkiezingsprogramma-na-kritiek-klimaatsceptici~a401a357/ i wish i was making this up , but ` climate sceptics ' are apparently getting a hold on the vvd . 
  that , and the vvd has reigned for 4 years in a way that hasnt shown much environmental promise whatsoever . 
  woot , from a blatant hater to a group of climate sceptics . 
  are n't we just blessed ? 
  from a pot ? 
  silly goose , most people here in fancy west europe got a senseo machine . 
  what , why are you frothing at the mouth ? 
  do n't you love senseo coffee ? 
   it targets exactly every anti-establishment politician . 
  how does the irony of this statement escape you ?
