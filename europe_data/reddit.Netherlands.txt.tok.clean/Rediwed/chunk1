  the idea behind ai is that it trains itself to think of an outcome . 
  if you give an ai thousands of pictures of cats it will ( when properly configured , as there 's no `` wide-ai '' yet ) train itself to recognise cats . 
  such a thing is doable with the processing power of your smartphone . 
  it 's not anywhere near doable for the foreseeable future . 
  but currently it _ seems _ like the only answer to automation . 
  please keep in mind that we will probably need to generally increased ubi as we decrease the overall workload of the human population as automation increases . 
  we ca n't see ubi working now , because we ca n't ** really ** see the true effects of automation . 
  i love how it changed from red to red . 
  what 's the story behind they ? 
  toxic chemicals that apparently us companies are too lazy to filter out fits into the gmo story how ? 
  if you shoot yourself with little bullets you can build up a resistance to larger bullets !,

  are you trying to say their economy is not mediocre or are you trying to say some eu members also have mediocre economies ?

  yeah !!, 
  what has the eu ever done for us ? 
  the uk is leaving the eu , what court should we use ?

  it 's easier to warm things up than it is to cool things down . 
  ahum , we are ** fascist ** nazi 's !, 
  you do need to detach your mind from reality to see that though .

  privatisation _ can _ be a bad thing .

  yeah , just to mock the us, 
  hm , i average out at 27km/h on a city bike . 
  that translation has to little error 's . 
  anti-weed ? 
  there 's some clients that can do this , but major clients like bittorrent , utorrent , vuze , transmission , rtorrent , deluge , etc wo n't allow you to do that . 
  omg delish . 
  we also make little balls called ` soesjes ' , those are filled with whipped cream as well . 
  those look small . 
  we dutchies like large balls . 
  edit : obv i meant large , oil balls, 
   eat this , drink alcohol and smoke a cigarette . 
  repeat this daily . 
  it 's apparently turksich though ... well , all the moroccan/turkish kebab shops make em . 
  well , the problem is that it opens a door for `` worse '' anti net neutrality rules . 
  i personally turned off my zero rating . 
  you make it seem like torrenting is downloading . 
  however with torrents you automatically also upload the content your download, 
  send t-mobile a message by turning it off . 
  you can turn off the zero rating in your my t-mobile app . 
  also i have unlimited data anyway . 
  valid arguement, 
  reddit wo n't be throttled . 
  it will be throttled within the us , but when you hire a server in a datacenter the data center wo n't treat you differently . 
  the only thing getting throttled is the us ' end user connections . 
  tier one service providers are n't going to throttle datacenters . 
  please , continue ? 
  you do realise that the net non-neutrality filter will only be applied to end users ( consumers ) , no ? 
  we wo n't feel any difference , the datacenters themselves wo n't be treated differently . 
  anything hosted in american data centers will reach us just as fast . 
  what bad rep are you talking about ? 
  are you confusing the us with the eu ? 
  at least in the netherlands , they can only not-count a specific type of web service . 
  if they want to zero rate spotify , they also have to zero rate google play music , deezer , tidal , apple music , etc , etc. 
  nothing changed for the eu , that 's what he 's saying . 
  the internet backbone ( data centers and such ) does n't go through an isp 's filter . 
  so , in the backbone the us has net neutrality as well . 
  it 's just that end users wo n't be able to access it in that way . 
  is n't the pirate bay accessible from the netherlands again ? 
  i 've been able to access it for a few years now . 
  to answer your actual question ; no , a judge can still order an isp to block a single website . 
  :( we just wan na eat bitterballen :(, 
  collateral damage !, 
  ... for not sharing our secret technology enabling such delicacies ? 
  please ^ ^ ^ help,

  5 % is just at the tipping point for herd immunity , right ? 
  not true actually , it has medical benefits in some people .
