  there are no wolves in large parts of europe , in part because they were hunted down for spreading rabies and hunting lifestock . 
  i think they even gave out a bounty for killing a wolf . 
  there was even this extremely cruel device , the wolfsangel . 
  it is basically a hook they hung from a tree , and they put meat on it , and the wolf would eat it and be trapped : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolfsangel today , the wolf is making a comeback in some areas . 
  there have been occasional wolf sightings in the netherlands , there was even one walking in a village , seemingly not afraid of people . 
  but i think so far they 've all been loners and there is no established breeding population . 
  a result of there being no bears and wolves , many animals have no predators , so people hunt them to keep the population of boars ( hogs ) and deer at managable levels . 
  boars are probably one of the more dangerous animals , as they are very strong and heavy , and they are very protective of their young , and they are also very smart . 
  the adults sometimes block off the road so their young can cross , and it 's better not to go anywhere near them . 
  they used to do boar hunting with special spears that had a horizontal bar added to them . 
  they let the boar charge them as they are fairly aggressive and the boar would impale itself on the spear . 
  the boar is also common in heraldy . 
  i think wolves are native to the us , but animals such as horses and hogs were brought over by humans . 
  here is an incredibly cute picture of a young version of the fearsome boar : https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:sus_scrofa_piglet.jpg and i think horses are also fairly dangerous as they startle easily and can throw off the rider . 
  well , at least they taste nice . 
  i think it is one of those writers that you either really like , or really dislike . 
  i have read lord of the rings well over 20 times . 
  the book is a bit different from other novels , and it does n't really follow the ` rules ' of how novels are written . 
  a lot of stuff is fairly unrelated to the plot , and especially fellowship has a very slow start where you do n't really get told what is happening until the council of elrond , halfway in the book . 
  the book is also self-spoiling at times , where they tell what a character will do in the future , so you know they will survive , long before the story has ended . 
  it helps to create the conceit that the books are real history books , written by someone who knew how the story ends , with jrrt merely as the ` translator ' . 
  btw , jrrt was n't a big fan of shakespeare , but he liked macbeth . 
  perhaps because it is closer to the kind of writings he enjoyed , medieval legends and ancient mythology . 
  i see most of the western hemisphere as just a bunch of europeans who no longer acknowledge the authority of the king and/or queen . 
  ` muricans are just western europeans , so there is no ` appropriating culture ' at all , it was our culture to begin with . 
  and what is all that stuff with allowing same-sex marriage and weed ? 
  the us appropriating that lovely continental culture from europe again ? 
  and rap is not just american . 
  rap is just a form of poetry or rhyme or meter , which has existed since at least the ancient greeks . 
  even beowulf is rap . 
  rap is just one of many cultural traditions where oral history played a part . 
  here is a reading of beowulf ( a long poem , this recitation by saemus heany is two hours long ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aab0trcztm0 they even use contemporary slang , in this poem known as kennings , a combination of words with a certain meaning . 
  the whale-path is the sea , the swan-paths are the rivers . 
  and one reason people watch a lot of us movies or tv shows is because many countries here have a small population , so there is too little demand to fund expensive movies and such . 
  there is no dutch equivalent of the star wars or james bond movies for example , and there is no foreign demand for dutch movies either as few people speak the language . 
  i really feel the opposite . 
  it 's been a very long time ago , but i still remember the scene with those three witches , and the part where they try to wash the blood off their hands . 
  that is such a great way of telling that this is a turning point in the story and there is no way back . 
  macbeth is also closer to mythological storytelling than many of the other stories , closer to the greek tragedies or germanic sagas and legends . 
  on the other hand i did n't care for the few comedies or love stories i have seen . 
  i do n't think the references to the genital area are funny for a modern audience , it 's not really scandalous anymore . 
  i think it just really depends on what kind of a story you want . 
  i do n't mind a tragedy . 
  my favourite author is jrr tolkien , although he was n't really regarded as literature in the past . 
  as a kid i read the books in dutch first , and then went on to the english versions . 
  they helped me learn english . 
  yeah , i think most people know how to it instinctively , but of course you can get better it by training . 
  i was just a bit salty we had to do all those stupid ball-games in school , i hate stuff like that . 
  it was mandatory but i always made a point to in zero effort . 
  even as a kid i did n't buy into the health craze , i am not interested in sports ( no , not even watching them on tv ) . 
  i just had some fries ( drowned in mayonaisse , the guys in pulp fiction were n't kidding ) , and now i 'm drinking white russians , 
  we did some stupid sports games when i was in school . 
  i did n't see the point because i rarely have the need to throw anything . 
  same with catching : if it is something of value it wo n't be thrown , and if it 's not , i can just choose to let it fall to the ground . 
  for the netherlands 30c would get us in heatwave territory . 
  in 2015 we had a freak occurrance where it reached 38c , which i think was a record . 
  usually anything over 25c is considered very hot . 
  keep in mind the buildings here are not designed for such weather but rather to keep warm . 
  almost no one has ac . 
  in my house , if it 's 20c outside it will get closer to 25-30c inside , depending on the amount of sun . 
  humidity is generally also extremely high in the netherlands , which makes the heat much less bearable . 
  weather today is cloudy and a bit misty , with a slight drizzle . 
  very humid . 
  about 20c . 
  here is the weather forecast for this week , it 's in dutch but you 'll understand the pictures . 
  today : 19c by day , 14c at night , 50 % chance of rain , and wind from the southwest , and cloudy . 
  http://nos.nl/weer/ as you can see the wind direction is southwest or west , which is usually the case . 
  the sea and ocean help keep it temperate . 
  if the wind is from the east , it 's usually either much colder or much warmer . 
  snow is very rare here even though we are on the same latitude as bits of canada . 
  you can make them yourself as well . 
  here is an example of a recipe : http://www.coquinaria.nl/english/recipes/stock/kroket.htm it 's usually spelled croquette in english . 
  the most common form crusted beef ragout that is deep-fried . 
  ` bitterballen ' are the same thing , but shaped like little balls : http://www.noorderperssocieteit.nl/events/20130527/img/bitterballen.png usually eaten with a bit of mustard . 
  you can even order them in the us ( probably because of dutch expats ) , but they are a bit more expensive than they are in the netherlands . 
  it even has a picture of a kroket cut in half , so you can sea the beef ragout inside : http://voorncroquettes.com/product/dutch-beef-croquette/ people also eat them with bread , ` broodje kroket ' , where they often put some mustard to go with it and cut or crush the kroket : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:dsc_0082_broodje_kroket_chiang_mai_2009_0629.jpg http://www.smulwereld.nl/l/library/download/9uqwi6cs-a-l9ykxq2yf9lvrm0x_a_4ky_a__a_f/broodjekroket.png?width=440&amp;height=402&amp;ext=.png many people here keep some kroketten in the fridge and deep-fry them at home , same with frikandellen , which are skinless sausages . 
  ` frikandel speciaal ' is a frikandel with mayonaise , curry-ketchup and raw onions . 
  the third picture is what it looks like when you order it ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frikandel and of course we also have blood sausages and liver paste like the countries surrounding us . 
  i love liver paste , it 's a fairly cheap and tasty thing to put on bread . 
  i even bought some today , it is packaged similar to this one : https://www.ah.nl.kpnis.nl/static/product/ahi_434d50303133303638_1_lowres_jpg.jpg it 's a smooth liver spread . 
  there are also types of ` leverworst ' that are not spreadable but that can be cut up into pieces , such as this one , and they are common party snacks : http://www.fryskambacht.nl/images/producten/friese-leverworst.jpg there is also the strange food known as filet americain , which is not from america at all . 
  it is raw , ground beef with spices that is often eaten on bread or crackers . 
  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:filet_americain_on_bread.jpg there are a bunch of other dishes that contain raw meat or fish , sometimes cured or smoked or fermented or brined or salted . 
  ` rolmops ' is a raw pickled herring , and is wrapped around a pickle ( ` augurk ' , tiny cucumber in vinegar ) : https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/rolmops https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rollmops and then there is this , raw brined herring eating with raw onions : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soused_herring, 
  a large amount of refugees will never have a job and will only cost money . 
  there are enough people to work if you consider the other european countries . 
  i think employers prefer for example poles to refugees , at least the ones i know do . 
  many businesses here rely on poles to get the job done . 
  ah , there is something to that , but i feel that tokkie is also usually aimed at social class . 
  utrecht had an election , where people could choose between two candidates from the same party . 
  does n't really sound much worse than how it is in the netherlands . 
  here mayors are appointed by the king , not elected , but it is usually the main political parties currently in power who decide who becomes mayor . 
  so mayors are appointed by the powers that be and we have no say in it . 
  i do n't understand why the us still uses the first-past-the-post system instead of some form of proportional representation . 
  in the netherlands there are some 11 parties ( i lost count ) represented on a national level , because of proportional representation . 
  parties need to form coalitions to gain a majoriy in the lower house , and preferably gain a majority in the senate as well . 
  sometimes the coalition needs to work with the opposition parties to gain a majority in the senate . 
  what it also does is that is does n't allow for very long election cycles . 
  in the us it takes nearly two years before the actual election , because the parties go through their own process of electing their nominee . 
  in the netherlands we can get elections at any time if the current government coalition falls apart .
