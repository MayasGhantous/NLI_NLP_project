  home of the the beormingas , the people of beorma . 
  the - ham means ` home ' . 
  wednesbury : the wednes bit refers to wodan/wotan , the saxon/german name for odin . 
  `` this map is bullshit , just nice names made up based on the origin of current the placenames '' . 
  i do n't agree with that comment btw , it is an etymological map so there is always quite a bit of uncertainty when trying to figure out the meaning of a placename from 1000-2000 years ago . 
  both the names and the daily language have changed a lot . 
  the word ` hoor ' is a modal particle , it 's often hard to ascribe a meaning to it . 
  dutch and german use a lot of modal particles . 
  one of our major politicians is a trump supporter , geert wilders . 
  his party is usually the largest or second largest in the polls ( next election is march 2017 ) . 
  i find this a bit more cheerful than a lot of the news i read on here . 
  judging by the number of replies others find it interesting as well . 
  although it would probably also work on subs such as / r/mapporn . 
  yup , land near sea is either belgium or flanders ( a region of belgium ) , my guess it is flanders , as belgium was named after the belgae , a name the romans gave to a group of celtic or possibly germanic tribes living in that area . 
  land of the people is germany , as their own name for their country is deutschland . 
  deutsch means ` of the people ' , and is cognate with dutch , duits ( the dutch word for german ) , and the various tyskland names for germany they have in the scandinavian languages . 
  ultimately derived from an old word in the germanic languages . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theodiscus it was even used in old names such as theodoric ( meaning people-ruler ) , the name of several early medieval kings , and the name survives in modern languages : dietrich in german , derek in english , diederik in dutch . 
  two mods from / r/thenetherlands made a fantasy-style map of the netherlands . 
  slightly different interpretation from this one , but not all the names have a clear origin : https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/comments/3vs7f5/i_made_a_fantasystyle_map_for_my_country/ the first post has an explanation and sources . 
  btw , there are often historical maps of individual cities and towns on wikipedia . 
  they also have a fantasy-feel to them . 
  and there are of course a lot of historical paintings . 
  everything that has a slight incline is a mountain in the netherlands . 
  we acquired a real mountain in 2010 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_scenery, 
  if you do n't have a magicka level of 50 , you could always wait for a low tide . 
  you can walk to schiermonnikoog . 
  it 's also that 's - gravenhage and 's - hertogenbosch use the old fashioned case system . 
  this is the possessive , short for ` des graven hage ' and ` des hertogen bosch ' . 
  dutch used to have a case system similar to german but has mostly lost it , so those names with 's - ' sound very archaic today . 
  i 'll ask them and get back to you in a few years , when all the different regional governments and linguistic communities have talked to each other about it and failed to come an agreement . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  it should all be returned to the rightful owner , the dutch empire , 
  and abel tasman discovered tasmania , it should be returned to us !, 
  and we should get indonesia back , even if just for the food . 
  that was our plan as well , it just needs a second war with belgium . 
  officially afrikaans is not the same as dutch , and the grammar is much more simplified than standard dutch . 
  but they are mostly mutually intelligible , although i 've heard it is assymetrical : harder for an afrikaans speaker to understand a dutch speaker than the other way around . 
  and we should n't forget namibia either , afrikaans speakers there as well . 
  well , it is a schiereiland in a way : there is a land connection on low tide , you can walk to it ( mudflat hiking/wadlopen ) . 
  so it is a near-island . 
  gelderland . 
  it 's from this map that was posted a few months ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/comments/3vs7f5/i_made_a_fantasystyle_map_for_my_country/ it has an explanation and sources in the first post . 
  some are a bit speculative , but that 's often the case with names from that long ago . 
  i 'm living in the land of the dragon 's cry , sounds a bit more exciting already . 
  an egypt-themed amusement park , under greek management . 
  ah , i do n't speak czech or any other slavic language , but i noticed it was similar to the russian word for people . 
  from what i 've seen of trump , that may take a while . 
  for him . 
  well , when you win the war it 's nice to have some money left over . 
  what skyline ? 
  there are no skylines here , just empty skies . 
  ` people 's bank of czechia ' ? 
  yes , the - ing , - ink , - ling , - inga endings all mean ` of ' in germanic languages , so basically family or ` the people of x ' . 
  it is fairly common in dutch surnames . 
  the surname alink means ` of ale ' , which is a masculine name , so they probably had an ancestor named ale ( not pronounced like the type of beer ) . 
  interesting example , birmingham in england :  birmingham as a settlement dates from the anglo-saxon era . 
  the city 's name comes from the old english beormingah\u0101m , meaning the home or settlement of the beormingas -- indicating that birmingham was established in the 6th or early 7th century as the primary settlement of an anglian tribal grouping and regio of that name . 
  so it has both the - ing ending in beormingas , ` people of beorm ' , and the - ham ending , meaning home . 
  also in reply to / u/berzelus . 
  freedom of movement of goods and people are tied together . 
  i do n't think the eu will accept an economic union with an opt-out of movement of people . 
  we are probably just too cheap to prescribe medicine . 
  it 's a major hassle to get any kind of medication , and it 's ridiculously expensive as well . 
  oh , it is not that hard to make it yourself . 
  here is a recipe : http://sausbaas.nl/saus/joppiesaus/ - 3 tablespoons of mayonaisse - 1/2 or 1 tablespoon of ketchup - 1/3 onion , finely chopped en ` gefruit ' ( uhm , lightly glazed ? 
  you could probably also throw them in raw ) - 2/3 teaspoon of curry powder - a pinch of paprika powder - salt and pepper and it says you can use a blender if you do n't like cutting onions . 
  joppiesaus meesterras, 
  [ dutch food ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lx8k5jfv_yu/vijs7hfqm3i/aaaaaaaafjo/kiccj2e6tly/s1600/img_9726.jpg ) is the pinnacle of civilisation . 
  and we also beat the belgians in the [ stinky sauce department ] ( http://www.frietopia.nl/img/uploads/026-20080311-friet2.jpg ) . 
  i 'm starving now . 
  you 're making me hungry . 
  do n't worry , you 'll be joined by your british friends soon enough . 
  perhaps they are wrapped chocolates in the shape of sardines ? 
  it 's the same in the netherlands , you generally have to renounce your other citizenship , but there are exceptions , for example if you can not do so or if it would result in problems in the other country , such as not being able to inherit family property . 
  for those reasons most turks and moroccans in the netherlands still have dual nationality . 
  it 's the old viking fury coursing through his veins that keeps him alive . 
  we have mosquitoes in november as well , that 's what you get for being a swamp german . 
  from what i heard tunisia is doing fairly ok after the arab spring ( unlike most of the other countries ) . 
  since you already seem to have another citizenship , you could also just keep the turkish citizenship and still have some influence by voting remotely ? 
  btw , the turkish minority in the netherlands overwhelmingly voted for erdogan , moreso than turks in turkey . 
  our government should make it official  not that that would work , i vaguely remember that ivory coast wanted everyone to call the country c\u00f4te d'ivore in any language , but of course that is now how things work , because you can not pronounce that in every language ( unless the person happens to speak french ) . 
  i do think that netherland sounds nice . 
  hhhhhgggggoen . 
  the belgians usually win in spelling contests , whatever that 's worth . 
  understand a news channel ? 
  that would disqualify even some native speakers . 
  i think a lot of those numbers are self-reported . 
  i 've also seen the ` statistic ' ( falsehood ) that 70 % of dutch people speak german . 
  i think netherland would be good . 
  the netherlands literally means ` the low countries/lands ' , but nederland has been a unified country since the 1800s . 
  no longer a bunch of semi-unified provinces . 
  it is singular in dutch : nederland ( lowland ) . 
  it 's more or less the same in the rest of the country , as most people have roughly the same tv channels . 
  they show stuff such as reruns of two and a half men , the big bang theory , all the csi shows and stuff like that . 
  and movies of course , the country is a bit too small to have a significant film industry . 
  there is also quite a bit of british influence , almost everyone i know ( of my age group ) has read the tolkien books in english , and knows about top gear . 
  sometimes people use french-based or latin/greek/english-based words , but only if they want to sound pompous . 
  but many people also make mistakes in their native language , especially in writing . 
  i 'm native dutch , and i notice mistakes in spelling or grammar all the time in the writings of other native dutch people .
