  you can buy weed at age 18 . 
  it 's technically illegal , but you are allowed to carry up to 5 grams on your for personal use . 
  selling is illegal unless it 's from a licensed pot store . 
  you can also grow either 3 or 5 plants for personal use , i forgot which one . 
  the production of weed to be sold in pot stores is still illegal , and law enforcement goes after them , for some strange reason . 
  they suck at it : i do n't think pot stores ever run out of weed , so it 's just to keep the police and justice system busy i guess . 
  pretty much all other drugs are illegal , but still widely used of course . 
  but if you overdose or get sick from a bad batch , you can go the hospital and not get in trouble for using drugs . 
  there were signs in amsterdam like [ this ] ( http://www.politie.nl/binaries/content/gallery/politie/stock-afbeeldingen/verdovende-middelen/cocaine-alert.jpg ) . 
  essentially the same scenario as in pulp fiction . 
  it emphasises you wo n't get in trouble just for using drugs . 
  of course , if for some reason you are searched and they find drugs , they 'll probably take it away except for weed . 
  last year we had a heatwave with temperatures outside getting to 38-40c . 
  which meant that my appartment was even hotter than that . 
  i 'm quite ok with 27 degrees indoors : but when it 's 27 degrees outdoors , it means my home is much hotter indoors . 
  27 degrees is fine with me , you just wear fewer clothes . 
  short pants , t-shirt , sandals . 
  the dutch weather is a bit weird . 
  i remember having heatwaves , but then suddenly there is a thunderstorm or a hailstorm , even at 30 degrees outside . 
  fork in the left hand , knife in the right hand . 
  and do n't cut your meat and then take your fork in the right hand to eat it the bits . 
  no need to apologise !, 
  i figured you did n't know about the floods here so i decided to be a bit patronising and tell you about it . 
  no harm , no foul , i hope . 
  the netherlands is basically a river delta next to the sea , and has to deal with the fickle north sea on one side , and with large rivers from the other side . 
  there have been floods from both sides . 
  people have been struggling against floods since ancient times , when some people lived on [ terps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terp ) , artificial mounds to prevent their homes from being flooded . 
  some of the oldest government institutions are about keeping the water out : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_board_ ( netherlands ) the flood of 1953 lead to the [ delta works ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delta_works ) , that act as a barrier against possible floods from the north sea . 
  i 've eaten wild boar with gravy that had a bit of red wine and a tiny bit of dark chocolate in it . 
  it was lovely . 
  let 's make the netherlands great again !, 
  there 's a funny video from when trump got elected . 
  the first few sentences are basically `` trump got elected , and his message is `` fuck you mother '' , but we want to remain friends with the us '' , the rest is in english : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-xxis7hdoe, 
  if you can sort of get by in germany , are n't you perhaps already a bit beyond the textbook ? 
  you might still learn a lot from the textbook , but you 'll also need immersion , using the language like the natives do : use german media . 
  i had german in school and i ca n't really speak it , because i rarely use it , and i have little vocabulary . 
  but i can understand a lot of it because it 's similar to dutch . 
  true !, 
  but also the cheaper grocery chains do these inspections , not just the more expensive/chique ones . 
  the person i mentioned told me that one of the strictest inspectations was from aldi , a budget grocery store . 
  they of course run the same risk : if someone gets sick from their goods , they 'll lose a lot of revenue . 
  it 's of course good that there are laws and that the government is inspecting these things , but i found it surprising that `` the free market '' essentially imposes far stricter rules than the government . 
  in some areas hunting is also needed to control the population , because humans wiped out a lot of natural predators . 
  otherwise they 'll overpopulate and wander into cities or roads . 
  wild boar are an example here , they do n't really have any predators except humans . 
  the basis of peanut sauce/satay sauce is very easy : just put some water and a lump of peanutbutter in a pan , and slowly boil and mix . 
  it will congeal into a thick sauce . 
  usually flavoured with some combination of soy sauce , sambal ( chili paste ) , fried onions , leeks , etcetera . 
  it goes well with a lot of food : chicken , rice , meatballs , noodles . 
  people here in the netherlands even eat fries with peanut sauce . 
  i do n't think europeans eat that much healthier , but the main difference is probably portion size . 
  i 've heard a joke from an american `` do n't go to france for the food . 
  in fact , take food with you '' , lamenting the small portion sizes . 
  the traditional diet here that my parents and grandparents grew up on was n't low on fat . 
  everything was baked or fried in a ton of butter . 
  a traditional dish here is `` boerenkool '' , which is kale . 
  it 's seen as a kind of health food in the usa , but here it was eaten mashed with potatoes , and covered in meat gravy , with an extra lump of butter thrown in , and accompanied by pork sausages or pork chops . 
  it 's not really what you eat , but how much of it . 
  and to lose weight , avoid empty calories . 
  for example , a sugar cube or a soda does n't contribute anything to your body except calories , it does n't contain essential nutrients . 
  beans for example contain a wide range of nutrients such as calcium , iron , fiber , and a bunch of other stuff , and since they contain quite a bit of fiber and protein , they fill you up more easily . 
  in the netherlands we have chocolate sprinkles , usually eaten on buttered bread , but sometimes we switch the butter for peanutbutter , and end up with [ this ] ( https://www.google.nl/imgres?imgurl=https%3a%2f%2fpbs.twimg.com%2fmedia%2fcvdumruwcaanlnz.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.upcoming.nl%2flotte%2f18446%2f15-geniale-snackcombinaties-die-een-award-verdienen&amp;docid=nxmlsyc9nccgvm&amp;tbnid=k2hsgn7cyb3ipm%3a&amp;vet=10ahukewjs6vwzxuxtahxbbcakhtkxbycqmwgqkauwbq..i&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;bih=744&amp;biw=1465&amp;q=pindakaas%20hagelslag&amp;ved=0ahukewjs6vwzxuxtahxbbcakhtkxbycqmwgqkauwbq&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8 ) , bread with peanutbutter + chocolate sprinkles . 
  baby , please do n't go !, 
  we went to germany quite a bit for cheap booze . 
  it was barely noticable you went to a different country . 
  that 's true , and a good thing , but it 's not just the eu that does that . 
  i know someone who works for a food production plant here in the netherlands , and he says the most strict regulations are laid upon them by private companies . 
  they sell products to tesco in britain for example , and tesco regularly sends over people to investigate the production plant and make sure it 's up to good hygiene standards and working conditions . 
  a well-known company ca n't afford to have someone get sick from their products , or from it being they use child labour , as it will ruin their reputation . 
  the demands from these companies regarding hygiene and working conditions are often a lot stricter than the ones from the government . 
  i think it was n't just the eu or european cooperation , but having a common enemy during the cold war that really bound the west together . 
  now that it 's over , shit is already falling apart . 
  i hope the foundations of the eu are strong enough . 
  there is a dutch saying : `` beter goed gejat dan slecht bedacht '' . 
  it means `` better to steal something that 's good , instead of making up something that 's bad '' . 
  it probably represents the struggle against the sea and the rivers . 
  * luctor et emergo * , i struggle and emerge . 
  that is the banner of zeeland , which had a flood in [ 1953 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_sea_flood_of_1953 ) . 
  my father lived near that area as a kid , and he remembers dead cows floating up the river . 
  about 1800 people died . 
  we essentially speak german , we just mumble . 
  the auld alliance !, 
  they are n't really speaking standard german , but some form of austrian german . 
  german is really a dialect continuum from which a standard language emerged . 
  a language such as luxembourgish is essentially a type of german . 
  i like to refer to dutch as swamp german . 
  [ the dutch lion !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_republic_lion ) even though there have n't been any lions here for thousands of years . 
  the european lion went extinct , possibly because of humans . 
  people sometimes dress up with orange lion hats or outfits for soccer games . 
  for the saxon areas , there is the [ saxon steed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saxon_steed ) , in both the netherlands and germany . 
  then they should speak more clearly  i found many people from the smaller towns in southern limburg fairly hard to understand . 
  interesting ama !, 
  i 'm somewhat similar , i 'm living off my savings right now and not receiving any government benefits , but i do n't really need more money . 
  my house is paid off , and i just need a little money for food , really . 
  i do n't have expensive hobbies . 
  yes , but it depends on the level of the speaker of course . 
  dutch people also have a weird accent when speaking english . 
  pronouncing a d at the end of a word for example is very hard . 
  the `` th '' sound also does n't exist in dutch .
