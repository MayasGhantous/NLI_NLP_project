  i would n't really know any cafe or breakfast place that 's open in the morning , not nearby anyway . 
  and my university had coffee in a pot on a plate to keep it warm , so you never knew whether it 's fresh or had been simmering for hours . 
  but no worries , you 'll find out after the first sip . 
  i had a similar experience with tea and coffee in the hospital lately , i think the only reason people drink it is because it 's said that dehydration is the most painful kind of death . 
  the food is no better : the most tasteless , soggy white bread in the world , with a small cup of fake butter , and extremely gelatinous jam with barely any fruit in it . 
  if you end up in a hospital in the netherlands , take your own food with you . 
  ah , you are correct , i forgot about her . 
  the fourth one as well i think , that would be prince harry . 
  [ edit : i 'm very wrong here ], 
  clovis and charlemagne are when you stole our identity . 
  we are the true franks , as we still speak a form of frankish . 
  we have such channels as well . 
  they are normal tv channels that only broadcast in the evening , and the rest of the day and night it 's those forttune tellers . 
  or tell sell-like stuff . 
  or naked women trying you get you to call or text them for some hot messages . 
  what i like so much about series 4 is that blackadder is so much more of an arse . 
  pretty much everyone around him is an idiot , and everything he says is an insult . 
  and of course the bleakness of ww1 . 
  fawlty towers was also on tv here . 
  i really love top gear , even though i care nothing about cars . 
  i just like the silly banter . 
  i think that season 4 of blackadder was pure genius . 
  i do n't know about black books or alan patridge . 
  blackadder !, 
  it was aired here when i was a kid . 
  i especially like season 4 , blackadder goes forth , the ww1 season . 
  stephen fry had a great role as general melchett . 
  other british stuff that 's fairly well-known in the netherlands is allo allo , dad 's army , keeping up appearances , are you being served ? , and of course top gear ( the version with clarkson , the new one does n't seem to be so popular ) . 
  and i also really liked time team , which was of course presented by ` baldrick ' . 
  but now time team is gone , top gear is gone , so what 's the use of britain ? 
  british tv is usually subtitled in dutch , and not dubbed . 
  and of course we can receive the original bbc channels . 
  if you like those movies , you might also like in bruges . 
  it 's a movie about two criminals hiding in belgium , and it 's full of dark humour and , strangely , catholicism . 
  there are so many different r 's we could write a book about them ( and people probably have ) . 
  but there is the tap in the front of the mouth , which is basically a very short d . then there is the real rolling r : you can make this sound by saying k/g , but while pushing air out of your lungs , which makes the back of your tongue move and hit your thoat repeatedly . 
  the rolling r is a streak of k 's , more or less . 
  generally , we are physically able to make all the sounds , but we only learn the ones that are part of our language . 
  it 's like babies making baby-sounds : they are just trying it out . 
  parents only respond to the ones that make sense , reinforcing those sounds in the kid . 
  that 's why it can be very hard to sound like a native in another language . 
  only for barbarians and savages . 
  and it may not be unique to the netherlands , but smoked mackarel is also wonderful !, 
  and smoked eel , that species is endangered because they are so tasty and have a long and weird lifecycle . 
  the word * leberk\u00e4se * seems very similar to dutch * leverkaas * , but it 's slightly different . 
  it 's basically liver saucage or * leverpostej * in slices , such as here : https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/leverkaas there are also quite a few types of liver sausage , some are smooth and spreadable on bread , others are tougher . 
  but * leverkaas * is seen as similar to a slice of ham , but made of mostly liver . 
  with mayonnaise of course , according to pulp fiction they drown 'm in it . 
  poffertjes !, 
  with half-molten butter and sugar . 
  it can not get much better than that . 
  currywurst can vary a bit : in germany it 's a sausage with curry-ketchup , but in belgium it 's what we call a [ frikandel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frikandel ) in the netherlands . 
  also often served with curry-ketchup . 
  the words used for street food vary even between different regions where they speak dutch , such as with * patat * ( which is what i call it ) versus * friet * or * frieten * , all names for fries or potato chips . 
  [ patat vs friet vs frieten ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:kaart_patat_friet_frieten.svg ) . 
  i 'm dutch and i 've never eaten a haringbroodje , or raw herring , meh . 
  try the kibbeling ( deep-fried fish ) with remouladesaus , 
  i 'm not so sure , there are still different ethnic groups in some of the countries you mentioned . 
  there are the afrikaners or boer people , coloureds , xosa , english , and so on . 
  someone can be both south african and also identify with their ethnicity , in the same way they someone can be both british and scottish . 
  although the people of northern ireland are obviously culturally very similar to either irish or british people , aside from perhaps religious and political differences relating to the troubles . 
  the word snert is sometimes used to mean ` shitty ' or something similar . 
  it is great though , it has a really earthy flavour and it 's often very thick , with pieces of smoked sausage or bits of pork or bacon in it , and bits of potato or carrot or other vegetables . 
  it 's a very nutricious soup . 
  people sometimes mention their spoon will stand up because it 's so thick , almost more of a porridge than a soup : [ picture ] ( https://www.google.nl/imgres?imgurl=http%3a%2f%2fstatic.zoom.nl%2f797cdf0b0a87c2bf8d7dcc5d6b484b8b-snertweer.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3a%2f%2fzoom.nl%2ffoto%2foverig%2fsnertweer.1576550.html&amp;docid=uqldvjvdchg_jm&amp;tbnid=wpkpmloom70x2m%3a&amp;vet=1&amp;w=508&amp;h=648&amp;bih=744&amp;biw=1313&amp;q=lepel%20recht%20overeind&amp;ved=0ahukewiyolkhwrpsahxpkcakhu4waecqmwhikciwig&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8#h=648&amp;imgrc=wpkpmloom70x2m:&amp;vet=1&amp;w=508 ) .

  the senate/upper house is supposed to be non-political and judge new laws purely on whether they are legally correct , but that 's often not what happens . 
  they can certainly shoot down new laws from the lower house . 
  there was an infamous ( but funny ) case , the night of wiegel . 
  hans wiegel was a politician from the vvd ( right wing liberals ) who were in a coalition with pvda ( labour party ) and d66 ( liberal democrats ) . 
  the latter party wanted to implement a law allowing for national referendums , and it was their condition to agree to form a government , and the other parties agreed to support it . 
  it got through the lower house , but it was stopped in the senate by a single vote : vvd senator hans wiegel voted against coalition policy , but also * against his own party * out of personal conviction that referendums were rubbish . 
  as the vvd agreed to vote in favour of the referendum law , it led to a political crisis . 
  this was around 2000 . 
  another version of the silly referendum law passed somewhere around 2013 , and it led to the stupid ukraine referendum . 
  i think we have 28 qualified parties competing in the upcoming national election . 
  the largest party vvdpolls under 30 seats , out of a 150 ( 76 needed for a majority ) , and they have said they will not form a coalition with the second largest party ( pvv , populist right ) or with the socialist party . 
  and that is aside from even trying to get a majority in the senate as well , which seems really unlikely for any feasible coalition . 
  we already had a minority coalition a few years back , with two governing parties and pvv supporting it but not being part of the government , and that fell apart . 
  i ca n't imagine how it would work with 4-5 parties . 
  i think voting in this election is mostly people voting * against * parties : right-wing people do n't want a leftist coalition , and vice versa , again complicated by anti- or pro-eu sentiments . 
  it will be hell . 
  i think some countries have banned polls during election time . 
  i do n't think that 's a good idea because i feel people should be free to hold polls and to read about them . 
  and it promotes strategic voting : people voting for a party they do n't really like , just to keep their opponents out of the government . 
  i find them interesting . 
  it foreshadows the political hell we are going to enter in the upcoming election in march . 
  forming a government coalition ? 
  fat chance . 
  ca n't they just turn op the volume in vietnam ? 
  i have several family members with bad hearing and it 's usually easier for me to speak to them via electronics than face to face , as i do n't need to shout or repeat everything because they just turn up the volume . 
  i 'm in the netherlands but my appartment building is very sound-proof , i pretty much hear nothing from my neighbours when i 'm indoors . 
  and it 's not even a very modern appartment , it 's from the 70s . 
  yes !, 
  whether something is considered a language rather than a dialect seems mostly to do with politics and whether the language has a country to promote it . 
  i do n't feel that having a written standard is in any way a requirement for being a language : if a population speaks in a certain manner and they understand eachother , it is a language , regardless of whether they can write . 
  generally people in gelderland speak standard dutch , especially in the cities . 
  but in many of the towns people speak the local dialect/language . 
  i 've met a bunch of people i could n't understand at all , since my parents came from the west and i speak only standard dutch . 
  but i 've lived in gelderland and twente so i sort of mostly understand the dialects from those regions .
