  so we are just a bunch of lazy bums . 
  there is absolutely no reason why the netherlands or germany could n't produce their own nukes . 
  does being broke count ? 
  there are plenty of people on the streets who are cashless , because they are broke . 
  you can still learn !, 
  there are even [ cycling lessons ] ( http://www.fietsersbond.nl/fietsschool?gclid=cllw4oc48necfuiq0wodyjydda ) available . 
  i think the main reason it 's advantageous to learn at a young age is that when falling over , children have a lot less falling to do before they hit the ground because they are short , and they are lighter . 
  as an adult you are more at risk of hurting your elbow or your knee when you fall over , or worse , your head . 
  the main problem is that beginning cyclists are often afraid of maintaining speed : speed is what keeps you upright , and steering is done as much by leaning to one side as it is by using the handlebars . 
  my very old grandmother who cycled all her life was unable to do so when she was in her 80s , as she could not maintain enough speed to remain upright , and her vision was not good enough . 
  but otherwise , the skill of cycling is much like swimming , once you know it you 'll always be able to do it when physically able . 
  and now i 'm going to be a jerk an call you allochtoon , since cycling and swimming are part of the standard skillset of dutch people . 
  but i ca n't do iceskating , i 'm a fake as well :(, 
  i hate cycling too . 
  there 's no point , they invented cars some 100 years ago . 
  if humans evolved from apes , why are there still apes ? 
  if cars evolved from bikes , why are there still bikes ? 
  i 'm holding a nearly full bottle of vodka . 
  aw , fuck it , it 's all hopeless anyway . 
  the netherlands is pretty much completely flat , so no mountaineering of any kind . 
  but there is a fairly unique activity you can do in the netherlands : [ mudflat hiking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mudflat_hiking ) . 
  you can walk from the mainland to one of the islands on a low tide ( or the other way around ) , and you 'll be walking on the bottom of the sea essentially . 
  always do this with a guide , as the onset of high tide could wash you away into the north sea . 
  the wadden islands or frisian islands are interesting by themselves . 
  they are shared by the netherlands , germany and denmark . 
  they generally have sand-dunes to keep out the sea . 
  the netherlands is also good for cycling , and has a bunch of cycling routes . 
  we had 81 political parties apply for this year 's elections . 
  it 's impossible for schoolbooks to keep up with the changing political landscape . 
  when i went to secondary school in the 90s we still had old 70s/80s textbooks for maatschappijleer ( civics ? 
  ) , it was so obviously outdated even to the students . 
  and it had a strong political slant . 
  that was about the time that the populist right was becoming more mainstream , but in the textbooks they were portrayed as basically nazis and their opinions were `` wrong '' . 
  the teacher was pretty good , he was a history teacher who also taught civics . 
  he did n't push his opinion that much , except that he was an unapologetic chain smoker and an atheist . 
  decent guy . 
  and to be honest , as an adult i do n't have the patience to listen to all the different parties . 
  i know i 'm not going to vote for radical christians , so i 'm not going to listen to their crazy-ass party leaders . 
  i feel that what should be taught in schools is n't the current party-of-the-week , but the origins of different political philosophies , and how the country is organised ( a constitutional monarchy , brought about by enlightenment values and thorbecke ) . 
  and sociologist thinkers such as weber , marx , t\u00f6nnies . 
  i 'm actually not entirely sure whether they are going to go through the motions this time . 
  in the past , the monarch invited all the pary leaders one by one , with the largest party generally given the first opportunity to attempt to form a coalition . 
  but the monarch is no longer officially part of this process since a few years , so i 'm not sure how it will go if the largest party has no chance of getting a coalition together . 
  if i had to guess , the upcoming elections will end up with mark rutte being pm again , with some coalition , perhaps a minority coalition , it 's happened before that the largest party did not provide the pm . 
  but there is also the feeling to take the voters seriously , and they 'll need to somehow adress that if wilders gains the largest amount of votes ( which will still be 20 % or so , so not nearly a majority of voters ) . 
  i think the main result of wilders will be to make it harder to form a governing coalition . 
  it may require a coalition of 4-5 parties , or a minority coalition supported by the majority of the lower and upper houses . 
  i think it is extremely unlikely that wilders will get into power in any way , but his party and all the small/medium-sized parties will make it extremely hard to form a government with 76/150 seats . 
  i think it 's telling that with the current debate about trump 's travel ban , that nearly all dutch politicians oppose it ( not that it really matters what they think ) , but geert wilders supports it . 
  stopping immigration , especially islamic immigration , has been one of his key points for some 10 years now . 
  my guess is that he either becomes the largest or second largest party , and the other political parties will have some token negotiations to form a coalition , with everyone knowing it 's not going to happen . 
  i think the odds of him becoming pm are incredibly low , as in impossible . 
  that does n't mean he has no influence : he can still debate in the lower house , propose laws , vote for or against laws , and he has probably been fairly influential in moving other right-wing parties to the right politically . 
  great news everyone !, 
  it 's the new dacia sandero !, 
  yes , we call products with low sugar and/or fat light , just using the english term ( as branding in english is common here ) . 
  it 's so common even that it sometimes feel strange to hear a commercial or a slogan in another foreign language , such as german for volkwagen or french for peugeot , while i barely notice if it 's in english . 
  another strange thing is how we never call it coke , but always cola . 
  coke is the white power , not a soda . 
  and light products have a reputation of being marketed at women , so now we have another coca cola product : coca cola zero . 
  it 's a diet coke , the same stuff as coca cola light , except it 's marketed at men . 
  i think this reasoning is the same as called light light , and not diet ( as diet implies that the customer needs to lose weight ) . 
  these marketing people are geniuses . 
  two other strange products in the netherlands that are branded as american , but are not . 
  [ filet american ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:filet_americain_on_bread.jpg ) , basically raw ground beef with paprika or something in it , and [ american fritesaus ] ( https://www.google.nl/imgres?imgurl=http%3a%2f%2f1.bp.blogspot.com%2f-uq5zvwwbrme%2fufngodupzhi%2faaaaaaaaei0%2fgtfw1kivdhm%2fs1600%2f20120908_152906.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3a%2f%2fanitalucius.blogspot.com%2f2012%2f09%2fthe-netherlands-mcdonalds.html&amp;docid=9kbplyqhjp-ynm&amp;tbnid=ucvt8uwaqagytm%3a&amp;vet=1&amp;w=1200&amp;h=1600&amp;bih=744&amp;biw=1359&amp;q=american%20fritessaus&amp;ved=0ahukewjmlbol6-nrahxdvrokhwkwbugqmwgukbiweg&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8 ) , which was mcdonald 's way to adapt to the local market . 
  ( which they seem to do very well ) . 
  people in the netherlands do n't eat ketchip with fries , mayonnaise is the traditional condiment . 
  so mcdonald 's adepted buy still found a way to stand out from the local competition : that green sauce is basically mayonnaise with herbs such as dille in it , and it looks a poisonous bright green . 
  later grocery stores started selling similar products as [ american fritesaus ] ( http://www.appiehein.com/224-954-thickbox/american-fritessaus.jpg ) . 
  well , nato has no intention of invading russia , so i think we 're all good . 
  it 's gon na be yuuuuuuge the fallout that is . 
  i think many people seemed to believe he was in overdrive mode during the election cycle , but that he would calm down after becoming president . 
  but that does n't seem to be the case . 
  although i agree on at least one thing with trump : europe should pull its own weight in nato . 
  nah , russia is ( aside from nukes ) no match for even just the european part of nato . 
  and i think the russians are smart enough to not start ww3 over some baltic clay . 
  we are such a pleasure , exporting high culture to the world . 
  [ i doubt it ] ( https://finnishcrashcourse.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/fpv0whf.jpg ) ok ok , that was finland . 
  second mention of drank en drugs !, 
  i had no idea anyone abroad got wind of this song . 
  drank en drugs !, 
  did someone mention alcohol ? 
  sort of libertarian centrist i guess ? 
  [ chart ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/yourpoliticalcompass?ec=-1.13&amp;soc=-5.28 ) turned out more to the left than i expected . 
  it 's almost like a zoo , where you can look at foreigners . 
  fine with me . 
  i 've been to amsterdam only a few times in my life , did n't care for it . 
  not to shit on brits , but i remember i was in amsterdam and there was some football match at the time , and the city was full of drunk british football fans . 
  it was in the red light district ( de wallen ) . 
  i thought to myself it was a great day , both for britain and for my hometown : all the idiots were gathered in once place , so the rest of the world could get a little peace . 
  customer service . 
  anyone who can get me a beer when i need one is an angel to me . 
  my kingdom for a beer !, 
  a few cities banned them , but as far as i know they are not illegal in most of the country . 
  still , mostly a thing for students and suchlike . 
  we also have a word for drinking beer while traveling or when going to/from the store : bvo ` tje , * biertje voor onderweg * , probably best translated as ` one for the road ' . 
  the * - tje * makes it a diminutive . 
  `` little beer for underway '' , as a literal translation . 
  but people generally do n't have their drinks in a bag here , never seen it really . 
  i think it technically it 's not allowed to drink in many places , but no one cares .
