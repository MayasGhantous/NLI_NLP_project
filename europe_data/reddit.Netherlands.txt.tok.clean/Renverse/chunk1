you 're missing out , dear neighbour . 
  try one , thank me later . 
  at that point , is n't it just a gyros ? 
  *** bad austria . 
  think about what happened last time . 
  [ it 's called the leo belgicus ] ( http://images8.alphacoders.com/437/437950.jpg ), 
  native dutch , c2 english , b2 spanish , a1 valenciano, 
  [ this . 
  ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ameristralia ) basically the most annoying reddit thing . . ever . 
  just do n't . 
  that ameristralia shit was the most cringeworthy circlejerk yet . 
  so , do n't you see . 
  europe is a socialist utopia where there are literally no poor people and no people at all starving on the streets . 
  some of things people in this thread have said are pretty shocking . 
  not in a good way . 
  destroy it ? 
  at least give it to food banks that help the less fortunate with food . 
  we love you too . 
   here are things that are much prettier and impressive in the netherlands . 
  your opinion . 
  also , this is about the `` world cultural heritage list '' , of which we have 10 here in the nl , and 2 of them are in amsterdam , 7 of them in holland . 
  op chose the most recognizable and famous one , nothing wrong with that . 
  but people 'll always have to bitch about something , no ? 
  remember freedom fries ? 
  ameristralia was the most annoying reddit `` meme '' i 've ever seen . 
  good fucking grief . 
  you chose the shittiest picture of leiden universiteit that you could possibly find . 
  so many other faculty buildings that are older than the medical centre . 
  [ / u/chemicalpleasure has some better representations here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2dhku0/oldest_european_universities_in_continuous/cjpwde4 ) . 
  i wish i had an interesting view . 
  living in the middle of leiden and my view is a pub . 
  well , the album does say `` eu capital buses '' , so that 's probably why . 
  wow . 
  i genuinely feel bad for you guys . 
  jesus that 's sad . 
  damn scots , they ruined scotland !, 
  henning wehn is the best . 
  / r/thenetherlands has been geo-defaulted for anyone surfing reddit in the nl . 
  goodness , yes . 
  my mother picked that up whilst we lived in spain . 
  it 's great , i like to eat it with some mayo . 
  i also miss the delicacies from when we lived there -- turr\u00f3n , horchata , etc. 
  ca n't wait until next year , i 'm visiting old friends again !, 
  you can stay in amsterdam , but look at the residential areas around it rather than near the city 's old centre . 
  that should have some more affordable housing . 
  i remember reading something about how after the olympians got there , grindr usage exploded there . 
  i could imagine , though . 
  trying to get some olympian thang . 
  no chicken tikki masala ? 
  nothing beats a good stamppot on a rainy day . 
  also good old gelderse rookworst met boerenkool . 
  or kapsalon , if you want to clog your arteries . 
  not exactly a `` delicacy '' , though . 
  that 's because we love you < 3 ~ ~ and do n't act like you do n't make fun of us as well ! ~ ~ , 
  you should look into living in the areas / towns around amsterdam that have a good train / public transport connection to it . 
  commuting with the train to your school or work is n't uncommon here . 
  amsterdam living is _ very _ expensive , especially around the centre of amsterdam . 
  [ that reminds me of this ] ( http://qualitybelgianroads.tumblr.com ) [ and this ] ( http://uglybelgianhouses.tumblr.com ) you silly belgians are hilarious . 
  when i asked for mayonaise with my fries in britain they looked at me like i was some kind of freak of nature . 
  the poor , unenlightened souls . 
  p.s. , britain : those fries were shit, 
  meh , they 're too busy fighting with themselves . 
  is this a real question ? 
  it kind of was n't . . 
  it really did sound as though you believed that . 
  jokes are difficult to detect without some kind of exaggeration . 
  i can just imagine accidentally sending a completely obscene thought to someone i did n't mean to . 
  let 's . . stick to language for now :p, 
  in a lot of asian languages as well . 
  we 've asked countries to change it but it 's pretty much a lost cause . 
  sometimes i wish we had a rival country to slag off like you guys do . 
  the denmark-sweden jabs i see everywhere are great . 
  we sort of have germany but we only really hate them when it comes to football . 
  seriously . 
  that comment was fine until he threw in that bombshell . 
  it really depends on what you do and where you are . 
  but as in , daily life outside of work ? 
  i almost never use english except for when a tourist talks to me . 
  i do n't have any english friends over here ( leiden ) , so yeah . 
  on the other hand , a friend of mine who lives in rotterdam knows a lot of intl. 
  students and a girlfriend with whom he speaks english , so i imagine he speaks it a lot . 
  i 've been multilingual ( dutch , spanish , english ) all my life so it 's not really an issue for me . 
  but outside of the internet i do n't really _ speak _ english or spanish so it was refreshing to use them and not speak dutch for a while . 
   france the home office will be at your door soon to escort you out of the country for treason . 
  [ aww , do n't worry . 
  i liked your country when i was there last january !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2burf1/which_european_country_other_than_your_own_is/cj94ts1 ), 
  the uk . 
  i went to the uk ( admittedly only the london area , my friend who i was staying with lives there ) and i loved it . 
  it 's so energetic and there 's small pubs everywhere , the best bar food ( english breakfast , sunday roast ) and beautiful architecture as well . 
  there 's also something very . . relaxing about talking another language for a whole week there . 
  i had a great time there . 
  a close runner-up is spain , though . 
  i 've lived there ( valencia ) for four years and am going to visit some old friends there next year . 
  i loved the country 's landscape and culture as well as the beautiful language . 
  hook him up to a turbine , free energy !, 
  why are you so salty ? 
  it 's perfectly normal for someone , especially someone who 's lived here , to express empathy for what happened . 
  if you 're an apathetic person that 's your problem . 
  which is why your referendums on key things like foreign policy should not be decided by a majority of 1 % or less .
