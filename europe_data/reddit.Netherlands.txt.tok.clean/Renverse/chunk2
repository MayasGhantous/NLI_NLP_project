  for things like this they should really be at least 75 % . 
   ridiculously good looking opinion . 
  they 're ugly and unpractical as shit . 
  are you sure you 're not part german ? 
  i honestly hope the scottish independence vote wins . 
  you should extract yourselves from the political toxic hellstew at westminster . 
  it sounded eerily like a rhetorical question . 
  but if it was a sincere question , sorry . 
  things like this can be difficult to understand over the internet . 
   why would someone not have the same views as i do ? 
  we did abdicating before it got cool . 
  that 's what happens when you try to use subtle wording in the title of the submission to sway opinion your way . 
  it 's been pretty hilarious . 
  lots of crazy got exposed . 
  why ? 
  we have one of the biggest natural gas fields in the world . 
  it is n't a surprise that we 're using it . 
  i do n't really know where this is from . 
  does anyone know ? 
  i wonder what our flag looks like . 
  yes , and [ so were we ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_of_the_netherlands ), 
  one day you will realise that the eu needs switzerland much , much less than less than switzerland needs the eu . 
  indeed . . they 're not exactly what one would call the biggest promoters of lgbt equality . 
  we may or may not agree with the government 's policies but in the bigger picture -- whether a government is doing job , governing -- they 're doing fine . 
  thats . . glorious . 
  i love little inside jokes like this . 
  it * would * be nice if you guys made up your minds already . 
  the same people who confuse the netherlands with denmark . 
  i feel like depicting us as ` stoners ' is incredibly inaccurate if you mean to portray us as country . 
  we 're not the ones who smoke pot , it 's the tourists . 
  your opinion . 
  i think the geometric abstraction , and the coins themselves are great . 
  photoshopped !, 
  that guy is n't german & neither is the flag . 
  the original is danish ( ? ), 
  i think . 
  ca n't find it right now . 
  nice try though , duitsland !, 
   japan is not apologizing [ where does this myth come from ? 
  do any of you actually do your research ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_war_apology_statements_issued_by_japan ), 
  * some russian protestors tried ( not very successfully ) to throw tomatoes at the king & queen at a russian museum . 
  because of that russian guy that killed himself here earlier this year . 
  got arrested and will have a maximum sentence of 2 weeks . 
  but you know how stuff goes in russia . 
  they might _ disappear _ . 
  oh , dang , you 're correct . 
  i was speedreading . 
  i really like it . 
  it looks modern , and the abstraction of his face & the relief is very original . 
  erwin olaf continues to deliver excellent work . 
  we ca n't , by law it is required that his face appear on the coins . 
  the bills would be a better fit for that , but i do n't think the ecb will allow custom bills anytime soon , if ever . 
  edit : disregard , i ca n't read . 
  yep , we 're right up there with you guys !, 
  well , the monarch is the one that looks at the election results and has his advisors inform the winning party of an election how to form a government . 
  but that did n't happen last time ( and look how it 's going . . ) . 
  aside from that , i guess he could refuse to sign a law , technically veto-ing it but there are ways around that . 
  and we 're very thankful for that . 
  -- gay community, 
  you drink heineken and grolsch , base your judgement on that and then proceed to call our beer bad ? 
  why i oughta ... you need to try some real dutch beer , like some of the ones mentioned above ( hertog jan , la trappe , brand , etc. 
  i think what he 's getting at is that it 's `` are pregnant '' and not `` is pregnant '' . 
  yep . 
  in my opinion , overall , albert heijn beats the other supermarkets here on pretty much every aspect . 
  even in price ( euroshopper ) and especially in the assortment of products you can get there ( in an xxl , pretty much everything ) . 
  bollocks . 
  i 've never had much of a problem with customer service here . 
  libreoffice ? 
  may god have mercy on their souls . 
  exactly !, 
  for those confused : connexxion is a dutch transport company who are primarily known for their busses . 
  please do n't . 
  we 'd rather not . . 
  that 's just a silly excuse . 
  they could 've just told us they did n't want to be with us anymore . 
  [ william the silent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_the_silent ) , naturally . 
  but if you want someone that 's alive , the king will do . 
  frikandel , kaas souffl\u00e9 or kroket ? 
  hey , do n't get all defensive !, 
  we 're just saying ... 
  this is how they 're invading us now . 
  subtly , but surely . 
  they 're pretty , just not very exciting . 
  i imagine there 's a few security and logistical reasons , but regional notes would be nice . 
  i like finding different country 's euro coins in my change . 
  calm down there , madagascar . 
  which is almost never , then ? 
  ... what the heck , duitsland ? 
  someone with the flair `` republic of catalonia '' posts pro-scottish independence graphs with no source cited ? 
  looks like secessionist propaganda to me , especially when last polled , a majority of scots wanted to stay in the united kingdom . 
  i think it 's mostly confirmation bias . 
  be nice , now . 
  [ the united kingdom of the netherlands is coming back ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_of_the_netherlands ), 
  we 'll welcome vlaanderen but france can have the walloons :p . 
  you 'll have willem-alexander and m\u00e1xima , though , if you do n't mind . 
  it seems as though we 've set a trend . 
  * whoooooooosh * / u/heiri00m 's comment is a / r/polandball joke inside joke . 
  david cameron is a walking conflict of interest . 
  that wink makes me uncomfortable .
