  being drunk all the time makes one forget about the cold , i guess , 
  tl ; dr : 40 odd asylum seekers from north african countries have been misbehaving badly the past few months , so they 've been put under house arrest for the new years ' celebrations . 
  the government is trying to prevent a repeat of ` cologne ' . 
  it 's where saint nicolas and black pete ( sinterklaas en zwarte piet ) send naughty children , according to tradition . 
  time to start sanctioning those countries on an eu-wide level if they keep refusing to take their own citizens back . 
  it 's where saint nicholas and black pete ( sinterklaas en zwarte piet ) send naughty children , according to tradition . 
  this is n't about winning or losing . 
  this is about preventing future civilian deaths . 
  apparently it 's popular with serbians and albanians , but only in the number of hundreds per year . 
   is wants to unite all muslims in one country well , that actually is one of the goals of a ` legitimate ' caliphate ( one that fully implements sharia , for one ) . 
  eastern thrace is . 
   the second person died in the attack source ? 
  i knew it , damn poles are the real threat , not extremist muslims . 
  he does not speak for everyone . 
  i 'm sure he is aware of that . 
  yeah , you danes are our bros. . let 's fight sweden together . 
  we 've always been the braafste jongentje in the eu-klas . 
  kind of goes without saying though . 
  you 're not even trying to keep up , looks like . 
  disappointed in you !, 
  even worse , what if he had the means of directing an asteroid towards earth !, 
  ah , so even if he had n't been caught it would n't exactly have been an explosion ? 
  i foresee lots and lots of counseling . 
  possibly taking the child away from his parents if it turns out they radicalised him . 
  he was instructed by an is member apparently , so maybe he put it together himself . 
  but then again , where did he get the explosives ? 
  also supplied by the is member ? 
  or did he perform some chemistry of his own ? 
  it was a joke . 
  soon it will be basically annexed by africans anyway . 
  eh , i 'd rather think it 's people around the boy who brainwashed him . 
  there are plenty of 12 year olds from muslim communities who do not attack people with nail bombs . 
  agreed , time to ban all kids . 
  how does a 12 year old kid end up wanting to kill others with a nail bomb ? 
  the article says he was instructed by an is member , but he must have been messed up beforehand . 
  hopefully they take a long hard look at his parents . 
  this guy is a belgian with a massive inferiority complex , just ignore him people . 
  it 's not exactly easy to educate underdeveloped , uneducated , very religious people . 
  the fault was letting them stay in the first place . 
  * triggered *, 
  that poor , poor girl . 
  what 's up with all the albanians applying for asylum ? 
  ataturk was the man . 
  have to agree with that . 
  the hitler youth in the later years were indoctrinated to the extreme by a poisonous system which probably included their parents and everyone else they knew , you ca n't really blame them for becoming nazis . 
  doubt that . 
  interesting . 
  maybe it 's partially also due to a simple lack of interactions between tribes ? 
  well , seeing as you did not exactly have big civilisations during the paleolithic , is it not kind of expected that you would not see much archaeological evidence for large-scale warfare ? 
  any ` warfare ' would basically be conflicts between small tribes . 
  does not mean that mankind was not aggressive back then . 
  you 're saying you would have preferred nazi germany to win ww2 so we would n't have to deal with muslim immigrants now ? 
  wow man . 
  true , war is hell . 
  always . 
  he was captured at the battle of caen in normandy , in 1944 , shortly after d-day . 
   if they really did all those terrible things they are accused of , why do many slavic countries still honor their volunteer men that fought in the ss ? 
  that is an incredibly weak argument and you know it . 
  95 % of human history ? 
  you mean the pleistocene ? 
  i guess mankind was too busy to survive back then . 
  true , but the wehrmacht were far from clean . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wehrmacht#war_crimes  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clean_wehrmacht sure , not everyone in the wehrmacht was involved in war crimes , but they were not exactly clean either . 
  several units cooperated with the ss in implementing the holocaust , for example . 
   be strong , be agressive , rape , plunder , kill - you 'll be rewarded . 
  definitely did work in the past though . 
  look at attila , timur , genghis khan .
