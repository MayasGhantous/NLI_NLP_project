  in oude pekela , the troublemakers seem to be ' a group of eastern european asylum seekers who are extremely unlikely to get a residence permit ' . 
  those 450 apparently have signed the so-called buma form , which registered them as asylum seekers ( though not necessarily applying for it in germany i guess ) . 
  we should stop taking in big groups of migrants that are prone to self-segregation ( and causing trouble along with it ) until we have a clear policy to prevent said segregation . 
  otherwise it 's just kicking the can down the road . 
  lots of albanians trying to claim asylum here in nl though ( they all get rejected ) , wonder why . 
  you really have trouble with reading comprehension , so maybe at least the uneducated bit is true ;-) note : the smiley indicates this is a joke . 
  do not , i repeat , do not , take this seriously . 
   the reverse ** might ** be true though i 'm not saying it ** is ** true . 
  funny though that you know ` quite a few uneducated racists who voted remain ' . 
  what were their reasons ? 
  just curious . 
  hence my calling it silly satire and cheap comedy , rather than good satire . 
  furthermore , i sincerely doubt that the majority of / r/europe thinks that all leave voters are uneducated racists . 
  the reverse might be true though : all uneducated racists are leave voters ;-), 
  only one that seems to be treating this video as anything other than silly satire is you . 
  do n't be so butthurt . 
  it 's just cheap comedy . 
  these are actually mentally handicapped people , fyi . 
  looks like both ` parties ' are guilty of such behaviour then . 
  well , brexit has n't happened yet , has it ? 
  noone knows what will happen then , though this uncertainty apparently has n't impacted the manufacturing figures . 
  it 's more like people are praying that it was terrorism . 
  look at right-wing subs like the_donald ( better yet , do n't ) . 
  all of them were already pointing fingers at muslims . 
  there was no bomb blast at all , it was an attempt at arson . 
  have n't we had like three or four similarly worded topics the past few months ? 
  you got my name right , 
  thought it was a common hungarian name . 
  thought you were quoting fotr , so i joined in . 
  do n't think he knows about second fence , balazs . 
  whelp , http://www.nature.com/news/italian-court-finds-seismologists-guilty-of-manslaughter-1.11640 it 's not like there was no precedent , though they got cleared later on . 
  anyway , they were quoting italian civilians , not officials . 
  civilians tend to say stupid things , especially after a disaster . 
  reminded me of this : http://www.nature.com/news/italian-court-finds-seismologists-guilty-of-manslaughter-1.11640 thank god that got overturned . 
  i read somewhere that there are lots of people in italy blaming the seismologists for not predicting this earthquake in advance ? 
  that 's kind of retarded if true . 
  there was a precedent : http://www.nature.com/news/italian-court-finds-seismologists-guilty-of-manslaughter-1.11640, 
  suck it , finland . 
  plenty of asian people wear similar bathing clothes , to limit exposure to the sun ( tanned skin is undesirable there apparently ) . 
  what if she simply feels more comfortable covered up ? 
  so forcibly preventing them from enjoying the beach is going to help them ? 
  well , it 's the law now i guess , but it 's a fucking retarded law . 
  we underperformed really , no need to brag about it . 
  we do n't have mountains , so kind of hard to compete in all those different skiing-related , snowboard-related , or bobsled-related sports . 
  only leaves ice skating really , and curling ( lol ) . 
  no excuse for sucking at ice hockey though , we simply do n't seem to care about it . 
  was that some dumbass dutchman claiming we 're the best in medals per capita or something like that ? 
  it was local news , just like this . 
  wish people would stop posting every single crime story in this sub . 
  it 's like they 're anticipating/hoping it 's muslims every time . 
  local news ? 
  i know obviously , i felt like being pedantic . 
  [ wrong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_scenery ) . 
  we really need some proper moderation in this sub . 
  nah , it was all the portuguese . 
  honestly . 
  you 're bound to come across some racists , fuck them . 
  i welcome all westernized turks , i have some turkish friends who came here from izmir . 
  just do n't start voting for akp now that you 're here ;-), 
  we need to find a way to exchange the akp idiots here in nl with you guys stuck in turkey . 
  dude , this ai n't the middle ages anymore . 
  nobody gives a damn about constantinople or its alleged occupation . 
  observing ramadan is going to be a bitch though , ca n't eat food to heal : - /, 
  eh , we have to suffer from stupid weed jokes all the time . 
  deal with it . 
  have n't our beaches suffered enough ? 
  might want to flair up , people ca n't see you 're from nl . 
  that 's why we put it on saba , some 7000 kms away . 
  that makes no sense ? 
  bah , you beat me to it . 
  anyway , hah @ finland !, 
  i do n't really care to be honest . 
  several other sites put it at 3rd or 4th place . 
  meh , whatever . 
  it 's probably bigger than ice hockey , seeing as its practiced in india and pakistan . 
  https://www.google.com/search?q=most+popular+sports i do n't know why it 's not popular in sweden . 
  too cold outside ? 
  it 's only the 3rd or 4th most popular sport worldwide . 
  google is your friend . 
  field hockey , genius . 
  doubt it . 
  damn , you 're a rarity !, 
  among can also mean ` in the company of ' instead of ` being a member of ' . 
  are we going to post every local crime story here now ? 
  eh , feeling like a lumbering giant all the time when on holiday in , say , china , is n't all that either . 
  there is no such thing as evil . 
  might happen , might not . 
  you may also get hit by a car tomorrow . 
  who knows ? 
  we actually do quite a few sports quite well , do n't we ? 
  eh , it seems to be a fact . 
  the girls i know definitely prefer taller men . 
  we managed one day . 
  pretty good . 
  maybe now we can manage two days in a row ? 
  doping ? 
  we 're not the russians or spanish . 
  cricket ? 
  hockey ? 
  yeah , they really need to get a room .
