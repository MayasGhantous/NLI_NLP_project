  maybe it 's a lack of real life experiences . 
  in the netherlands this crap happens as well . 
  i should know , as i 've participated in the ( far ) past . 
  exactly . 
  people claiming that only immigrants do this kind of stuff are full of shit , or simply have led a sheltered life . 
  no you can not . 
  nice biased translation . 
  with the main difference that there is no longer a major influx into germany , whereas italy keeps receiving boatloads of refugees and migrants daily . 
  italy is being screwed over by the rest of the eu , like greece before them . 
  adolescents act like retarded kids when drunk . 
  i guess there is a lot of frustration amongst the asylum seekers . 
  apparently there is a lot of corruption going on in the various shelters as well . 
  sounds like a volatile mix . 
  drunk swedes , obviously . 
  eh , dutch kids and drunk idiots pull this kind of shit as well , so it does not surprise me to see this happening in sweden . 
  all fun and games till someone gets a rocket in their eye . 
  germany exports a lot of stuff . 
  having a currency in common with a lot of other nearby countries is really , really , helpful for that . 
  it does ? 
  what , and no longer enjoy watching ze germans build atlantikwall 2.0 on our beaches ? 
  no way . 
   figures released tuesday by the eu statistics office , eurostat , show that around 420,000 asylum requests were processed in germany in the first nine months of 2016 - more than in all other 27 eu countries combined . 
  a total of 756,000 asylum requests processed in the eu between january and september 2016 , 55 percent of which were handled in germany . 
  of the overall 988,000 eu asylum requests made in the same timeframe , around two-thirds were made in germany . 
   italy processed some 68,000 asylum requests in the first three quarters of 2016 while receiving around 85,000 requests . 
  france processed nearly the same number at 63,000 . 
  although italy processed the second highest number of asylum requests , the total still only comes to less than one-sixth the amount processed in germany . 
  sure , but where 's the fun in that ? 
  no , we do n't hate our friendly southern neighbors . 
  make fun of their shortcomings , sure . 
  whatever you lot do , do not bomb rotterdam again . 
  it finally looks decent . 
  did you lot secretly anschluss us when we were not looking ? 
  always feels good to share some culture with ze germans . 
  driven by the statistical study of human populations ? 
  happening more and more here in the netherlands as well . 
  looks very interesting . 
  i have only visited the excellent kumu museum in tallinn so far ( apart from the old city , obviously ) , the last time i was in estonia , but this looks like it 's worth a visit as well . 
  must have seen that recording 100 times already by now . 
  love the way he conducts the audience . 
  such authority . 
  radetzky march ? 
  yeah , they should have labeled germany with ` lack of humour ' instead . 
  no clue , i do n't know many ` average right wing ' dutchmen . 
  yeah , was n't sure if that was the word . 
  not referring to furnaces , but more like those small heaters for personal use . 
  seems like we 're going to do just that . 
  it 's mainly the north africans causing trouble and being terrorist shits . 
  they 're mostly economic migrants . 
  real asylum seekers from syria et al generally do not cause much trouble . 
  i do n't know why , but i always crack up when i get to wales . 
  welsh , not even once . 
  that 's cause you listen to fado all the time . 
  well , dutch is not a dialect of german either . 
  in fact , french is basically a mashup of latin and german ;-), 
  yeah , that 's too cold . 
  so you do n't , got it . 
  geert wilders ' brain will seize with a division by zero . 
   like the romanians and bulgarians stealing ~ ~ our jobs ~ ~ anything of value, 
  thank god for no dutch translations or * shudder * dubs . 
  they would be horrible . 
  i feel sorry for the german cinema goers . 
  how does one pronouce that ? 
  what do they consider it then ? 
  a bit nappy ? 
  sorry about that , removed the tumblr link . 
  what , the curtains ? 
  yeah , i got most of my vocabulary from shows like the simpsons and south park . 
  yup , sinterklaas and zwarte piet come from spain bringing presents , and after a few weeks return taking the naughty children with them . 
  not sure if it was specifically madrid though . 
  true , they 're thugs and criminals .
