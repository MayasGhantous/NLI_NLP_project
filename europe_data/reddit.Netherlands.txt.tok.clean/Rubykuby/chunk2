  racism/sexism/discrimination / what-have-you against any group is acceptable these days . 
  it just so happens that the discrimination differs per group . 
  any qualitative/quantitative measurement of discrimination is horsecrap , though . 
  some women do n't get a lot of sexism their way , others do . 
  some men deal very well with the sexism thrown their way , others do n't . 
  some women have it worse than men . 
  some men have it worse than women . 
  it 's not a race to the bottom , though . 
  oh yes . 
  i completely agree . 
  and i never said non-white-men are the only competent people ever . 
  it 's just an imbalance . 
  but to explicitly have as target a 50/50 balance between white men and `` others '' is false equality . 
  a target that says `` the right people to discuss the matter at hand '' is much more realistic . 
  sure , you wo n't get a perfect 50/50 attendance , but you 'll at least get the right people . 
  and if you make sure there 's no racism/sexism in the selection process or at the conference itself , then there 's not a lot else left to do . 
  is that sarcasm ? 
  because if it is n't , this racism/sexism against white men translates to just as much racism/sexism against anything non-white and non-male . 
  why ? 
  because * the sole reason for their presence is to be a fancy minority/oppressedkin * . 
  many female software engineers do n't know whether offers towards them are because of their skills , or because the institution wants to hire women to meet some kind of `` equality quota '' . 
  if you were a female software engineer , would you prefer to be denied on the basis of not meeting the requirements , or hired on the basis of being female ? 
  ** never mind the fact ** that it 's absolute disregard of personhood to dismiss the turning down of individuals on the basis of their ethnicity/sex , * even if * that ethnicity/sex might be considered better off . 
  like , * you 're actually trying to justify blatant racism/sexism * . 
  not-transgender . 
  it 's a term that 's really only applicable when discussing gender . 
  cis is the latin ~ ~ / greek ( ? 
  ) ~ ~ opposite of the word trans . 
  it 's preferred over `` normal '' because that kind of asserts trans people are explicitly not normal . 
  i know . 
  i 'm entering software engineering as not-white-cishet-male . 
  i do n't like public speaking and stuff , so my fairly modest approach is to just discuss this stuff with my future colleagues every now and then . 
  whatever happened to judging by levels of competence ? 
  this shit is arguably more discriminatory and degrading than outright in-your-face discrimination : `` fuck white cishet men for being overrepresented in fields of expertise . 
  everybody else , * we 're literally only inviting you because you 're not white , cis , heterosexual , or from not-europe !, 
  * '' i get it . 
  white men are present at higher rates in a lot of fields , but that 's not necessarily a problem . 
  just invite the people who are competent , okay ? 
  and if it so happens that a big chunk of those people are white and male , then you 're basically literally racist and sexist for denying them entry in favour of other ethnicities/sexes . 
  edit : hi / r/shitredditsays . 
  latin and greek . 
  the dutch use apparaat . 
  germans ? 
  not productive ? 
  crimea ? 
  you mean russia ? 
  not * belgian * chocolate , chips and roasts , though . 
  / u/autowikibot where are you :'(, 
  superior for people who only care about ease of use , not superior in most other use cases . 
  oh , companies should be free to make their own cables , so long as they make sure their cables work on every platform , do n't vendor lock-in , open up the spec sheet and do n't charge for the implementation . 
  the xkcd i linked will still be in effect , though . 
  but so long as the things are open sourced , as it were , i do n't really care . 
  but as it stands , usb is the only thing that meets the above prerequisites . 
  it 's like running a handheld emulator on your computer ; it 's not very ideal and there 's a higher chance of bugs . 
  which is a hack and a terribly unclean implementation . 
  clean implementations are important to people who have to get devices working with external sources . 
  but it 's no use arguing for the potential ` superiority ' of lightning , because ( a. ), 
  apple will never allow others to implement it and ( b. ), 
  apple will never open up its spec sheet if point a turned out to be false . 
  [ this is a pretty good list of all the things usb supports ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usb#device_classes ) . 
  except not tied to samsung as a vendor . 
  and it 's still under development , so no claims should be made yet until a working prototype is presented . 
  there 's an [ xkcd for that ] ( https://xkcd.com/927/ ), 
  old crappy technology ? 
  it 's an up-to-date standard with so many more capabilities than whatever apple has . 
  i can plug mice and pen drives into my phone with a simple usb-to-usb adapter . 
  the freedom to do those things beats the ability to stick the cable in both ways . 
  propose something else that works on every platform , is not tied to any vendor , and has an open implementation . 
  yeah ... 
  it 's a monarchy , though . 
  i 'm part of this statistic . 
  at the age of 16 someone grabbed my throat because i flipped him the bird . 
  i went to the police with it . 
  now i 'm `` one of three women '' who are victim of violence and/or sexual assault . 
  poor me . 
  hey serbia !, 
  you 'll do fine . 
  endl\u00f6sung : remove kebab . 
  a psychologist gets to decide that . 
  their suffering is fucked up on so many levels . 
  their wish to end it is real and in no way `` fucked up '' on their behalf . 
  if a child wishes to cease suffering , and the only real option is to arrange a consensual death , i see no reason the state should forbid such . 
  but does it have kangaroos ? 
  i , too , can pull statistics from my ass : http://www.gallup.com/poll/158066/special-report-adults-identify-lgbt.aspx, 
  one in thirty-ish . 
  3.3 per cent . 
  the uk should have a flag of itself on there , really . 
  j/k i love moderates < 3 but yeah , the test is n't that good, 
  fuck moderates . 
  father as well , provided the father is married to the mother or acknowledges the child as his own before the age of 7 . 
  history revisionism , man . 
  we have collectively decided that vikings were brutes and savages . 
  it does n't matter what they actually did . 
  this is a satellite sub . 
   i 'd rather be called racist or an asshole than american !, 
  they are synonymous . 
   i hold the belief that the hollanders together with the zealanders have a lot of frisian ancestry . 
  [ well yes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/frisians.png ) . 
  the limburger was right . 
  fuck , how much it pains me to say that .
