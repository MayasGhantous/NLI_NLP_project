  well it 's nice that they came up with an idea but it 's clear it will be most likely be used to fold paper planes with . 
  it 's interesting to read your story but at the same time i ca n't help but think that you yourself are old enough to make certain bridges . 
  you mentioned poles before . 
  well i am polish , i live in the netherlands , i go to poland every summer cause i 'm alone here , all my family , even mother and brother are there yet here i am . 
  i made the conscious decision not to buy a dish to watch polish tv shows , or follow polish twitter , news etc cause i felt like that would make my world and understanding of it too small being in another country . 
  i still feel polish , i have dual nationality , 2 passports and a strong connection , so i understand how you feel cause you not british and yet not turkish either . 
  i get the same , here i am called polish , in poland they say i 'm dutch and it 's tempting to submerge yourself in the nationalistic feeling just because you have no real place and peace but i think it 's too limiting my friend . 
  turkey will never be your real home like poland will not be my home unless we both move to those countries . 
  so instead , i would say , focus on where you are mostly . 
  but ... why ? 
  shit , that 's a lot of money ... 
  so still unclear what 's going on there ? 
  i 'm trying to keep it decent , 
  just a bit unfortunate lol, 
  [ oh really ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/ubdki-hsitg8jt0srtsxmcr07avygwu6qgxhru4he9a.jpg?w=1024&amp;s=200ad0714be42cad4681c100c237d254 ), 
  but there is no oil ? 
  uspok\u00f3j si\u0119 , im coming on holiday to spend some hard earned cash :p, 
  ca n't watch it , at work now , 
  i 'm going to poland this sunday . 
  i surrender myself to the slavic overlords , fuck this . 
  yeah i think they had something similar in mind when i look at the style . 
  you 're welcome . 
  it took quite some years but i think everyone in the city is happy about how it turned out . 
  sure they can . 
  my former in laws are alevi , they have no sympathy for erdogan . 
  beter yet , my ex has dropped his turkish nationality and kept the dutch one only to distance himself even further from this mess . 
  we will never get a common ground on this one so instead of going in circles , let me introduce you to the exit . 
  goodbye !, 
  he did n't make a comment about any amendment . 
  he made a comment about 17 year old immigrants not allowed to own guns ... no shit , in what country would it be allowed anyway ? 
  besides it 's always their defence : `` criminals do n't care about the law '' .

  there is a glass roof there .

  that was practise k ? 
  you mean everyone that has a gun in the us has obtained one ( or few ) legally ? 
  i would n't call alevi a sect tho, 
  oh now you going to say banter is only reserved to the english huh . 
  yeah it was meant tongue in cheek but i guess it does n't come off that way , 
  let me screw my tinfoil hat a bit tighter to my scalp, 
  things have changed , get with the program . 
   broadcaster cnn turk said so no it does n't put false flag to bed . 
  it 's 2016 ... and ? 
  beter not say what i really think, 
  nicola wasting no time !, 
  i dunno if you noticed but you 're the first to reply and it 's comment like yours that make shit get downvoted cause of the whine . 
   all those dutch somalis are coming home . 
  did you just go full retard here ? 
  you 're a bit late , it 's 99 % sure to have failed . 
  he has landed now . 
  the deal is sealed . 
  he will land any moment now so it 's done and dusted, 
  well that was it guys , we can go to sleep now . 
  in turkeys case it would mean becoming more secular after ergodan continuous firm hand on everyone so ... yeah ... 
  as soon as i heard they were losing the airport it sealed the deal tbh . 
  exactly , you ca n't compare the 2 . 
  sadly it failed and now erdogan is going to get even stronger . 
  it wont, 
  this guy will walk around with his dick out for the rest of his life . 
  dominance established , bown down bitches . 
  if he gets to land on the airport , it will be over soon . 
  if erdogan gets to land in istanbul , that 's it , it 's done coup will be squashed . 
  military and airforce is pro coup . 
  people on the streets and police are pro erdogan as he urged them to resist . 
  this can not fail now , if the military fails , erdogan his dick will be permastiff and he 'll use this till the end of times confirming what a great leader he is . 
  handy tho , you know exactly who your opponents are d :, 
  i pray to god the military can keep the casualties low and get erdogan out of the house . 
  link to bbc stream ? 
  i know , i been watching shit go down too , i do n't even know what to think at this moment . 
  just zip it . 
  stay safe turkish friend . 
  i hope it will settle fast . 
  i just opened a channel with loads of men gathered under a street light . 
  i was just watching periscope ... there is loads of people gathered and chanting the name of erdogan, 
  what the hell is going on people . 
  i do n't know ... am i for or against this ? 
  i mean sure erdogan gone would be good but what would replace him ? 
  you certainly are not getting a second referendum tho according to may ... 
  oh comon man , do n't break the `` female privilege '' circlejerk here . 
  who would 've thought huh . 
  maybe there is an opportunity for industry , creating bootstraps . 
  feel sorry for the remain people that been warned about this . 
  you can call him willy, 
  do n't think he was bothered by it . 
  you just had to go there did n't you . 
  that boiling tea lol, 
   i voted remain , and i 'm a firm advocate of the eu but i find it a little stupefying that some eu diplomats and citizens have the view that they need to punish britain in order to avoid other countries leaving , rather than improve the eu in order to appease sceptical eu citizens . 
  there is no punishment tho , it 's just saying `` we 're looking out for our interest '' , it would be weird to offer the uk a same deal they have now within the eu cause if that 's the case , what would be the benefit to stay ? 
  the uk and eu are now simply opponents and both look out for their own interests . 
  that 's not a punishment is it ? 
  whether , how and if the eu improves is not of uk concern and can run parallell . 
  but it has nothing to do with how the brexit should develop from here . 
  hold on , i need to grab my magnifying glass, 
  patronizing much ? 
  so dramatique ... twink ? 
  maybe he could come down and do it himself if it 's means that much ? 
  too busy busting their ass ... and not in a good way . 
  wait , that would n't effect birth rates anyway . 
  nevermind,
