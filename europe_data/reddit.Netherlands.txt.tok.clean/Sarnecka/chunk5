  what exactly is the point of having maps with the origin of different names of tea , yes , no etc ? 
  these people doing the logistics must wonder why on earth so many all of the sudden demanded books ... even during summer holiday . 
  you made them all proud , studying about the eu in your summer break lol , 
  oh i know . 
  sadly i have family that support him ... 
  some countries need to show their kids that condoms do exist ... 
  it 's the exact opposite of what he 's saying . 
  you ca n't be forced tho to accepting it . 
  i mean sure on paper you `` have to get the euro '' but there are quite a few countries that are not willing to go for it ( yet ) . 
  i hope you really do n't take it personal , it 's all in good joke , we do n't hate you guys at all . 
  i 'm afraid so , it 's an endless source for puns and banter  `` would you like some eggs to go with your ~ ~ brex ~ ~ breakfast ? '', 
  no but many consider wales to be in one breath with england tbh . 
  the notion of different countries mostly persists on your island . 
  to many of us what goes on in england = wales . 
  it has nothing to do with wanting to pin england and leaving wales out of it , in a way , sadly enough , wales is just irrelevant as an individual player . 
  you 're always welcome silly islander , 
  cause the bullshit is still going on when you just open the daily mail on any given day . 
  `` the euro is crumbling , we got out on time '' `` countries are lined up to trade with us '' `` the eu needs us more than we need them '' '' our meps are being bullied by the other other members in brussels '' it 's just tragic . 
  i read them as a guilty pleasure cause sometimes you need a good laugh , just avoid the comments . 
  i do my groceries in germany cause they are cheaper . 
  i fuel in belgium cause it 's even cheaper than doing so in germany . 
  when i visit my family in poland i go through germany and czechia cause i live right down in the south . 
  i would be fucked if i had to through the queue minimum 4 times a week , let alone my belgian and german colleagues that would have to do it twice a day . 
  so yes there are people that `` travel '' regularly if you wan na see it that way but that 's one side of the coin cause that 's just for leisure or necessity . 
  what about all the trucks/logistic branch and their duties and adding paperwork for them , time is money , paying even more if expeditors are needed , it will get calculated through to the consumer at the end . 
  congrats portugal !, 
  can i just say , speaking for football generally , it was a bad championship . 
  many matches were merely functioning as a background noise to have on while doing something else . 
  and portugal winning is the perfect example of that . 
  there were a few brilliant individual actions but as a whole it was dissapointing . 
  he needs to sit his delusional ass down . 
  this was actually pretty funny , 
  i suggest you have a look at this map : http://www.moikrewni.pl/mapa/kompletny/sarnecka.html whatever it is , it 's better than the `` i 'm an asshole for no reason '' cathegory you 're in . 
  what ? 
  it 's polish ... ? 
  i suggest you look at my name and connect the dots for yourself . 
  do n't bother reasoning with people like him . 
  threads like these make me happy i 'm not sporting a polish flare . 
   albeit al \u00b7 be \u00b7 it ( \u00f4l-b\u0113 \u2032 \u012dt , \u0103l - ) conj . 
  even though ; although ; you missed a word in my sentence . 
  the problem is that many are picky . 
  even when polish parishes took in syrian catholics they left in the middle of the night across the border . 
  they got a flat fully furnished , schools were arranged for the children , internet was hooked up for them and they could start a decent living ... albeit to polish standards . 
  i will safely assume if you place 40.000 syrians in poland , 90 % of them will leave in the first 3 months . 
  i 'm a sucker for flash mobs but really ... they are so 2009 d :, 
  polthuania wooo \\ o /, 
  yeah i do n't think regular people like you and me should have anything against each other either . 
  days , months , years , decades and centuries have past now . 
  let us look forward instead , 
  well i am polish but living in the netherlands since i was a kid and i have no problems with lithuanians . 
  the past is the past and we can only take that as a reminder when we try to move forward . 
  the reason why i have limburg as my flair rather than the netherlands itself is because we differ quite a lot with our own ( recognized i may add ) regional language , so our towns have a name sign in dutch and in limburgs for example : https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hhtkudjc5l4/vvyw2cvzsti/aaaaaaacbrq/ofxxdztp7rwt89afvtpzgnq-cn3xcib3wchm/s150-c/epen.jpg . 
  the south here is catholic vs protestant north . 
  the scenery is different [ up north is what people think when they hear `` holland '' ] ( http://natuurfotografie.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/arkemheen_jan_willem_schoonhoven_luchtfoto_2.jpg ) when in reality where i live looks like [ this ] ( http://www.epen-limburg.nl/files/166xmu2m6.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.1limburg.nl/sites/default/files/public/styles/article-detail/public/istock_000023614410_medium.jpg?itok=swcyfocr ) so yeah we differ a bit which is not a problem to anyone , it 's not like limburg wants to seperate itself but we just are happy with our own identity , and also being a part of the netherlands ( where the rest of the country comes to have a holiday cause they feel like they are abroad ), 
  country = clay nation = people, 
  some people are into that kinda stuff , i 'm not judging , 
  well , i get that it stinks if they would n't act on it but by the rules of the book it is allowed to happen . 
  there are a few countries in europe that had referenda before where people voted `` no '' and it still happened so i do n't see the undemocratic part when the rules are set on the table from the get go . 
  yes we 're especially envious at your roads . 
   free movement really just favors eastern europe yeah because britain for example really has something to complain when the ee immigrants pay in more then they take out . 
  undemocratic ? 
  there is in theory nothing undemocratic about having an advisory referendum and not act on it . 
  that 's why it 's a non binding referendum ... ? 
   the uk did not restrict freedom of movement from eastern europe when we were allowed to and others did . 
  why should we not be allowed to do it now instead ? 
  that 's not how it works and you know it . 
  you 2 , get a room . 
  chocolaaateee nooooooo, 
   continental europe is seen as a rather silly place . 
  do i need to translate that to : i see contintal europe as a rather silly place ? 
  it 's also a linguistic group but i did n't say that . 
  feel free to dispute my claim . 
  slavs are an ethnic group and there is a slavic gene , i 'd say racism is an accurate term . 
  tl : dr : nothing to see here , keep moving ? 
  i hope the polish lads keep their head down cause there is only so much pressure you can put on a group of people until the situation escalates . 
  really ? 
  you got a source ? 
  dunno what it is but i 'm sceptical at any chinese offer . 
  good for britain do n't get me wrong but to me it seems more benefitial to have a good neighbour rather than a friend far away . 
  you are not fooling me comrade !, 
  is that what they call a documentary in slovakia these days ? 
  ( i had seen it before btw ), 
  you are trying to trick me that 's where your gypsies live . 
  but i 'm an ( undercover ) ee too :(, 
  i live in the south , never seen one of those things , slootjes . 
  [ this is my area ] ( http://www.epen-limburg.nl/files/166xmu2m6.jpg ), 
  hey back off , i claimed this scottish lad first . 
  surprised you didnt get downvoted yet with that remark like i did lol . 
  do n't worry , the scottish usually have a better reputation then the english , at least what i hear . 
  what are you even on about man ? 
  looks like the class clown wasnt you but him, 
  maybe that 's because many of them have been bought by your nothern neighbours , 
  i 'm willing to take many sources but geenstijl is not one of them . 
  they still go on about how the dutch voted no for the ukraine to join the eu when he and everyones dog know it was n't about that at all . 
  my god the `` english high horse special snowflake '' - of the week award goes to you . 
  who cares tho , what 's been done is done . 
  being called a wanker is not an issue tho . 
  if you specify nationalities with it , the connotarion becomes slightly different, 
  it was - . -, 
  all lies people , if everyone would just stop speaking about it it would all be gone by now tssk .
