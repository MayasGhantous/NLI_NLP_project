  ... why does n't every government do this ? 
  seems way cheaper than sending dozens of letters . 
  immigrants do n't want to go to poland , they just want to go to germany and sweden . 
  some of them end up in the netherlands but i doubt it was their initial intention . 
  this whole `` spread the migrants across europe '' thing is a desperate move from merkel , and nobody except the germans and swedes actually support it . 
  just cut the immigrants out of the wellfare system . 
  there . 
  done . 
  germany should start building a new atlantikwall , but facing the mediterranean . 
  mittelmeerwall anyone ? 
  i bet it feels kind of awesome right now . 
  first world problems . 
   after this , we had a few more beers and then went back to the shipyard where i assume you re-boarded your viking ship and sailed back to denmark . 
  that 's actually a good question . 
  translation : prostitution is legal when it concerns consenting sex between two adults . 
  however , forced prostitution , prostitution by minors and insecure working environments do still occur . 
  to protect sexworkers and improve their position , the government aims to change the law for sex-companies ( no idea what those changes might entail ) . 
  the government also aims to ban prostitutes younger than 21 . 
  it 's bound to be a significant percentage at the very least , that 's true . 
  or , you know , illegal labour that no one else wants to do . 
  to be honest , it 's not as if the things you just listed are exclusive to immigrants . 
  there 's plenty of home-grown europeans doing those activities . 
  to assume that every single one of the illegal immigrants will end up in the criminal circuit seems ... biased somehow . 
  still though , we 've already got plenty of young males from the middle east as it is . 
  if they ca n't prove they 're from syria , they had best fuck off to the shithole of a country they came from . 
  well i do n't see those male immigrants prostituting themselves anytime soon . 
  ... i need the rest of the story . 
  i approve of the colour you gave the netherlands . 
  he better not try to spear more dutch , we 've got plenty of problems with people getting impaled with long pointy objects against their will as it is . 
  i like option c. just send the undesireables to siberia like in the good ol' days . 
  democracy : when you only give the people a say in how to run the country when it 's convenient . 
  whenever our king visits ... anything , this luckytv guy dubs over the footage making the king and queen sound ridiculous . 
  even the king himself admitted that he laughs at these . 
  part of the joke is his accent , and the many linguistical errors that his wife makes while speaking . 
  but obviously those are difficult for non-dutch speakers to understand . 
  just focus on the carhorn and the ridiculous laugh . 
  last time i checked i was n't drowning in the mediterranean , so no . 
  * edit : comment before me was `` are you by chance a syrian refugee ? 
  i really doubt that actually . 
  i ca n't think of a single thing that i dislike about scandinavia . 
  i love how the only thing that scandinavians can ever agree on is hating on other scandinavian countries . 
  they 'd really rather not , but the dialogue had to be re-opened in order to reach a deal regarding the refugee situation . 
  the chance of them actually joining is minimal , as the human rights situation in turkey is far from the european norm and that 's one of the requisites to apply for membership, 
  the article also speaks of criminal records by 24 , and recidivism by former convicts . 
  also i doubt that the numbers are so skewed because the police specifically target minorities . 
  even in a worst-case scenario that would only explain a difference of a few percentage points . 
  i 'm dutch , and for as far as i know the police force is n't racist . 
  more crime is committed by people from bad neighbourhoods and those have a greater percentage of third-generation foreigners living there . 
  holy shit , i think you just described the middle east . 
  the first thing i would do if i were in his shoes is delete all accounts and disappear for a while . 
  maybe go on holiday in a neighboring country . 
   communist nazis -  communist national socialism -  ** socialism ** -  ** communist national communism ** * `` operation liberty eagoil is go !!, 
  `` we will liberate all europeans from the yoke of communist oppression and their remaining oil reserves . '', 
  fun fact : 4.6 % of all containers that are unloaded in rotterdam are actually filled with american tourists that were too heavy to go by airplane . 
  they use rotterdam it as a staging point to fan out all over the netherlands , although some are loaded into inland ships to be shipped to germany . 
  not that any of them know the difference . 
  or we could just ask the germans to occupy zuid-beveland again , and shell any ships that come by . 
  that 's some very nice access to the ocean you got there !, 
  it sure would be a shame if * something were to happen to it ... *, 
  which are already densely populated . 
  and as always , most people live on or near the coast . 
  the population of africa is also still growing super quickly , which is going to make things worse before they get better . 
  ^ this . 
  i 'm not worried about keeping my own feet dry , i 'm worried about what will happen when bangladesh and parts of india start flooding , and people start fleeing from the water . 
  a humanitarian disaster the likes of which the world has never seen . 
  make the waterworks great again, 
  i guess it 's time for the dutch to start building their own nukes then . 
  although i seriously doubt that trump would disband nato . 
  i do n't think he has the authority to do so , even as president . 
  he may try to lower funding and throw a fit if he does n't get his way , but even trump must understand the importance of keeping the alliance together . 
  well clearly people do n't care about electing an experienced politician to be president . 
  it 's almost a hateful slur by this point . 
  i see you order bottle of vodka . 
  historically speaking , vodka is russian drink . 
  i 'll be taking this . '', 
  this sub is like / pol / but for people that are mostly not autistic , and with way less americans . 
  got ruined by england, 
  because his popularity would have skyrocketed afterwards . 
  like i said , he could have used the eu as a scapegoat for everything that went wrong , and without offering a sensible solution , people would think that he is right , and vote for him . 
  voters are idiots . 
  i came here to say this , fantastic channel !, 
  i watched it for the last two years , and indy truly made me realize that the first world war is interesting as hell !, 
  just because the front was not moving on the western front does n't mean that nothing happened elsewhere . 
  and thanks to the deal with turkey , at least the greek borders are closed now , and a shared european coastguard is being organized to deal with the influx of migrants crossing from tunis . 
  things take time , that 's bureaucracy for you . 
  quick adaptation is not one of the main strengths of the eu . 
  still not worth leaving the eu over though . 
  it 's not actually a bad tactic , as long your campaign is n't too good . 
  they were hoping for a close outcome , the closer the better . 
  boris would have loved to have lost with 49 % of the votes , but he overshot his goal . 
  if he had actually lost , he could 've whined about europe and why britain should have left europe every time anything bad happened . 
  new recession ? 
  eu did it . 
  huge surge of refugees due to wars beyond the control of the eu ? 
  eu did it . 
  england flooded due to bad weather ? 
  eu did it . 
  however , they overestimated cameron and the stay campaign , and are now left without any plan whatsoever . 
  most of those laws actually make good common sense , and customers are very protected in the eu . 
  which forces companies not to be assholes , which is a good thing .
