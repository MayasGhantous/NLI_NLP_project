100 % was exaggerated , but it happens a lot . 
  i do n't blame the german though because most people would understand you anyway . 
   ( side note : the germans are horrible about going to denmark and assuming people know german . 
  worse than the french . 
  learned that while working in a summer resort ) this is also 100 % true for germans in the netherlands . 
  the majority will understand it though so it 's kind of justified . 
  i think it 's the other way around . 
  the number would probably be higher if we did n't have elaborate spatial planning . 
  i think it 's more that these countries invested in cycling infrastructure and awareness . 
  there are plenty of flat countries/area 's that do n't have the same numbers ( or even close ) . 
  of course the flatness helps greatly but also keep in mind that the dutch do have lots and lots of wind which can make a bicycle trip very tiring and sweaty too . 
  probably because he was the oldest mod left . 
  the list of mods in the sidebar of a subreddit is in order of ` power ' . 
  you can only remove mods below you on the list . 
  noctarchy must have been the 2nd mod in the list . 
  when i was in charleroi in 2012 i was shocked to see the bad parts of the city . 
  it looked like the stereotype we have of ukraine of russia . 
  never thought i could find this in belgium . 
  the gap between flanders and wallonia was a bit bigger than i initially thought . 
  woops my bad , did n't notice the other comment . 
  in 2007 a lot of eastern member states joined . 
  before that the eu average of gdp per capita was higher because the old member were/are richer . 
  with the new eastern countries joining the eu the average dropped significantly because the new countries were not as rich as the old states . 
  therefore there are two base lines in these stats ; a higher one for the old 15 states up till 2007 and a lower one for the 25 states after 2007 . 
  not really ideal . 
  we do have lots of wind though , do n't underestimate how much effect that has sometimes . 
  that 's the geographical definition . 
  you also have a great talent called bob jungels . 
  it looks like he might make it to the top too . 
  the schleck brothers have a bit of a dip though . 
  they are very popular in the world of cycling and i believe also in luxembourg . 
  / r/peloton is the subreddit for pro cycling btw . 
  i know a few people who call grolsch headache-beer . 
  [ god dethroned ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug7qovscuj0 ) and [ cirith gorgor ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtzuo3nadgw ) too . 
  same here . 
  we must have a good ` weerstand ' though , 
  i wonder why anyone would want to live there in the first place ? 
  looks like the rotterdam and antwerp ports are pretty nasty . 
  you forgot to whore out / r/peloton !, 
  20.45 cest, 
  there are loads of german tourists on the waddeneilanden . 
  it 's incredible how much german you hear when you 're just walking around . 
  the worst thing is everybody here predicted that this was going to happen and yet they still introduced the weed pass . 
  when i went to sweden a couple of years ago i was amazed by the systembolaget ( government run alcohol store ) . 
  at first we were surprised that you could n't even buy 5 % beers or wine in the grocery stores . 
  but after we found our first systembolaget , a whole new door opened . 
  so much alcohol in one place ( especially the one near the central station of stockholm ) , never seen such a thing before . 
  it was pretty expensive though , a good 30 to 40 % more than what you pay in the netherlands . 
  the second option , they turned luxembourg into a dot . 
  sports : / r/soccer , / r/peloton , / r/formula1 music : / r/metal , / r/punk , / r/progmetal , / r/djent world : / r/geography , / r/mapporn , / r/polandball , / r/redactedcharts, 
  looks smooth , nice update !, 
  i believe in the netherlands it was high support . 
  when our christian party ( cda ) was n't in the government for the first time in a very long time ( 40 years or so ) , the labour party ( pvda ) and the liberals ( vvd ) immediately changed all those laws in favour of the open minded . 
  cda never bothered to change it back afterwards . 
  that was not correct though , they forgot the number 8th of that tour ( 2004 ) , cadel evans . 
  but it 's true , the vast majority of the riders were doping . 
  shameless plug for a pro cycling subreddit : / r/peloton . 
  that makes a lot more sense , 
  but we are very direct/blunt people , that would fit better with the askers as well . 
  they wo n't . 
   also , what 's up with pronouncing zeven as zeuven ? 
  it 's just plain silly . 
  that 's just the south . 
  nobody does that in the rest of the country . 
  to me it always looks like a lot of treathening , but no real action . 
  to make it more confusing : a lot of dutch folks use holland when talking in english , because it 's shorter and everybody knows what you 're talking about . 
  many , many dutch folks do n't give two shits if you call it the netherlands or holland . 
  i can assure you , there are lots of people in the netherlands who do n't know all this too . 
  all of that sounds pretty heavy , our breakfasts are way lighter than that . 
  our breakfasts are really boring compared to other countries , but we do have good bread . 
  [ fenal\u00e5r ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xftn445qc70/trjlqmhjq4i/aaaaaaaaf9y/exir1sbulmw/s320/fenal%25c3%25a5r01.jpg ) looks great !, 
  that 's because potato 's have no real flavour . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qchk9pndvfk ) it 's red wine with coke , apparantly it 's from basque country and it 's called kalimotxo . 
  what do you eat for breakfast then ? 
  the slice bread with jam is really big here in the netherlands . 
  i believe it is in the netherlands . 
   the segregation is ten times worse than in the netherlands . 
  can you elaborate on that ? 
  why is it worse ? 
  i 'm a human geography student with an interest in these kind of topics . 
  as a dutchie i agree . 
  many people here do n't think we 're nationalistic but we are quite a lot . 
   if your data ca n't be clearly interpreted , it 's worthless . 
  agreed , but that 's not the case here . 
  the data is way easier to read now than with many different colors . 
  with many different colors you constantly have to look to the legenda and back . 
  for this map you 'd have 11 different colors , not handy at all . 
  the way the map is currently presented is easier to read because you can easily compare regions , they have only have different shades . 
  you do n't need to constantly look to the legenda to compare because the shade in the maps itself already tells you the most important info . 
  the way this map is done is actually how you learn it in university . 
  maps with lots of different colors like you mentioned are actually a big no , especially with this kind of quantative data . 
  why do so many dutchies want flanders to join ? 
  it would be fine by me but most flemish people want none of that at all . 
  it 's not really neccesary to mention this is every thread about flanders . 
  in hindsight it 's very obviously dubbed but as a child you just do n't notice . 
  [ great theme song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btgaeg55nt8&amp;t=23 ) !, 
  ah sweet memories ... 
  do n't know about this one but in general these storages have numbered or coloured ` lanes ' or something to help you remember the right place . 
  i would add tennis together with the sports you named . 
  exactly .
