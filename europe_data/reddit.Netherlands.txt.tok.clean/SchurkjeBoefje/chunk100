  well , that 's the problem , these people do n't even recognize the fact they voted for a house fire to redecorate their living room . 
  they 'll find out soon enough though . 
  whether they will take responsibility for their shitty decisions or blame it on anyone else remains to be seen . 
   so if you want a change desperately you would vote trump if i do n't like my living room interior and want to do some redecorating and rearranging , obviously i want change . 
  burning my house down would definitely be change . 
  but would it be a desirable type of change ? 
   because i can show you a breakdown where for example trump voters replied in exit-polls that their economic situation got worse . 
  another thing is that people often blame migration and somehow it is not classified as economic issue which is just misleading . 
   and then for some fucking reason they voted for the party that 's looking to turn the entire usa into kansas . 
  you think kansas has a good economy for the working class ? 
  it 's hard to maintain the argument about economic anxiety if the parties winning votes are the larger of the two corporate cronies . 
  unless one wants to say that the people voting like that are fucking dumbasses . 
  which i 'm quite willing to do , btw . 
  ( `` this is why trump won , hurr durr '' ), 
   germans have an almost pathological faith in their leader thus spoke the trump supporter . 
  my sides have just imploded from the irony . 
  you 'd be surprised ... 
  the gop and angry right-wing talk radio have , quite literally , spent 30 years demonizing the clintons . 
  people made a living writing hateful books about them . 
   obusius : west-flemish farmers explaning to polish workers what to do if they hit a ww 1 shell . 
  holy shit , my sides, 
  all the weight always on one foot with a bit of gravity assist + conserving momentum probably helps . 
  [ oppressed minority detected ] ( http://orig00.deviantart.net/6213/f/2014/139/7/6/soviet_penguin_by_elizabethowl-d7iy5l0.png ), 
  i like this mayor more than the one who called for the lynching of the fashion designer guy . 
  i would n't know where to start , and it would prove a fruitless effort in the end . 
  i 'm not going to waste time on feelsforters who live in their own alternative realities . 
  i 've tried that before , politely , rationally , to talk to your ilk . 
  only thing that happens is that they just spit in my face and topkek about leebrul tears or some other shitty meme . 
  so no . 
  something about there 's a saying in tennessee , i know it 's in texas , prolly in tennessee ... 
  gods in heaven , you 're dutch too . 
  sad . 
  reality does have a well-known liberal bias after all . 
  `` those numbers are bullshit '' \\* provides sources * `` i do n't like that reality and will substitute my own ! '', 
  lmmfao, 
  whatever you say , mohammad . 
  heil trump and praise allah !, 
  fascists have to stick together after all .

  my panties are n't bunched up at all . 
  in fact , i tend to laugh whenever i see trumplets and feelsforters complain about echo chambers and other subs . 
  the lack of self-reflection is absolutely stunning . 
  just like extremist muslims , actually . 
  you guys are pretty similar after all . 
  same mindset , same tactics , both are a threat to europe . 
  i 'll just call you mohammad from now on . 
  do n't bother . 
  you 're talking to an ~ ~ alt-righter ~ ~ , sorry let me use the more appropriate term here : neo-nazi . 
  edit : you downvoting trumplets just prove my point that you 're supporting fascism and nazism , you dumbasses . 
  you were the one crying about this sub being an echo chamber . 
  leave if you do n't like it . 
  go back to the_feelsfort then . 
  you wo n't be missed here . 
  something like 30 % thought hillary is a literal demon , and just under half of trump supporters still think obama is a kenyan muslim . 
  the level of disinformation is real over there . 
  neither does this one , but you 're complaining about echo chambers whilst being a member of literally the biggest safe space on reddit . 
   the majority of this sub seems like a far left echo chamber thus spoke the_donald poster . 
  you pretty much need annotations anyway if you want to make the journey through that rambling piece of shit any easier . 
   `` ankara mayor melih g\u00f6k\u00e7ek praised lynch attempt on \u015eansal and said \u015eansal provoked ` honorable ' turkish nation , in his twitter account on monday . 
   meanwhile , beste uyan\u0131k , a presenter at turkish tv channel cnnt\u00fcrk , tweeted before the lynch attempt that \u015eansal must be cut down to size . 
  she later deleted her controversial tweet . '', 
  not just lynch mobs , but incitement and justification for them as well . 
  lovely . 
   i personally do n't care about the cheese you 're on a watchlist now . 
  pretty sure we had more fighter planes in '95 than we do now . 
  we bought 200 + falcons in total , i 'd be quite surprised if we 're still using more than a 100 as of today . 
  some i have n't seen mentioned yet : [ la haine ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113247/ ) , french , 1995 [ simon ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393775/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_12 ) , dutch , 2004 [ lola rennt ( run , lola , run ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130827/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) , german , 1998 [ amsterdamned ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094651/ ) , dutch , 1988, 
  of course there were suspicions . 
  even in the mid war years , illegal papers in the netherlands wrote of rumours of gas chambers . 
  but suspecting is different from knowing . 
  the nazis did n't shout from the rooftops that they gassed 70k jews that week after all . 
  also , the difference in scale from the t4 program to stuff like the reinhard aktion is pretty crazy as well . 
  as you say , the leap is n't that big , but we 're looking at this with the benefit of hindsight as well of course . 
  i feel that this particular topic tends to devolve into a debate where both sides often argue ` past each other ' instead of with each other . 
  i think the main distinction that needs to be made with this issue is between the widespread knowledge that jews , gypsies , slavs , etc. 
  were going to get fucked in the ass ( to put it bluntly ) on one hand , and on the other hand the brutal directness of the various holocaust killings . 
  it 's ludicrous to claim that people would n't have known that certain groups were heavily persecuted . 
  but that 's a significant difference with assuming widespread civilian knowledge of the literal death factories and the role and task of the einsatzgruppen . 
  himmler was a bureaucrat . 
  did n't stop him from having a huge role in the murder of millions of non-combatants . 
  dude literally wrote `` i 'd stand with the nazis if they did something about the immigrants '' and you 're right here defending it . 
  fucking incredible . 
  a horde of brownshirts could be performing der ewige jude around an altar of zyklon b cans and you would still say that calling them nazis would be out of place . 
  unreal mental gymnastics . 
  i 'm not even going to bother . 
  da fuq i just read ? 
  and you trumpers wonder why no one likes you ... 
  lmao . 
  so the nazis bred ` nazi super cows ' for size and strength , but the ` nazi super cows ' turned out to be so aggressive that they had to be put down . 
  sure as hell checks out with what we know about nazis . 
  as far as tanks go , that 's not too bad really . 
  pretty much every normal person 's response , as shown in [ this 2000 + yr old source ] ( http://www.wijnboutique.nl/media/wysiwyg/paginaasterix.jpg ), 
  as a fan of boaty mcboatfaces i would love to visit the vasa museum one day . 
  words out of my mouth !, 
  did the casu marzus raise up and kill the humans ? 
  all hail the job creators who art in the board room, 
  any specific reason to all those colours ? 
   netherlands where rape is tolerated as long as the ethnicity of the perpetrator is the `` correct '' one ? 
  [ tfw ] ( https://cecilymichelle.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/wtf-face-nick-young.png )  `` i guess you can get extra points if you works against your own country and than everybody will say that you 're exactly the opposite of a nazi . 
  one step away from calling me a ` race traitor ' i bet .
