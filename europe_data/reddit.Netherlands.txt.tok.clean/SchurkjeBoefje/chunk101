  i mean , for fuck 's sake , the guy literally said he would ` stand with the nazis ' if they are going to do something about immigrants . 
  as if a cheeky ustase reference is so out of place ... but that wo n't allow you to self-victimize like the fascist snowflakes you people are . 
  get off breitbart and the_feelsfort , kid . 
   common sense should n't surprise you . 
  i 'd rather not have my sister stoned for liking a guy , you artificially brained nut wit . 
  genociding entire ethnicities , babies and all , is so much better . 
   you artificially brained nut wit . 
  my , my , that incivility . 
  i hope the mods do n't see it . 
  would be so tragic to lose your insightful comments on this sub . 
  that does n't surprise me from a trump supporter .

  your wewladdery is over 9000 . 
  flair definitely checks out tho . 
  nostalgia for them ustase days ? 
  no pigfuckers allowed . 
  liechtenstein can into kebab !, 
  he actually slightly overestimated the soviet casualty count , for what it 's worth :  `` all in all , the germans deliberately killed about 11 million noncombatants , a figure that rises to more than 12 million if foreseeable deaths from deportation , hunger , and sentences in concentration camps are included . 
  for the soviets during the stalin period , the analogous figures are approximately six million and nine million . 
  these figures are of course subject to revision , but it is very unlikely that the consensus will change again as radically as it has since the opening of eastern european archives in the 1990s . 
  since the germans killed chiefly in lands that later fell behind the iron curtain , access to eastern european sources has been almost as important to our new understanding of nazi germany as it has been to research on the soviet union itself . 
  ( the nazi regime killed approximately 165,000 german jews . ) '', 
  http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/03/10/hitler-vs-stalin-who-killed-more/ tallying up all the casualties that nazi germany was * responsible * for obviously yields a significantly higher numer . 
  the soviets and nazi germany combined lost well over 30 million people between 40 and 45 . 
  this knowledge brings me great relief !, 
  oppressed minority detected ? 
  aaah , a few decades , that 's enough for exploitation !, 
  ~ ~ after that we 'll just turn the whole area into a concentration camp for the belgians post-annexation ~ ~ nothing to see here ... 
  rurhgebiet is not valuable ? 
  aye , one of the more blatant ` gib clays ' in our national history xd the partition in the op is even more juicy tho . 
  so much extra wealthy clay !, 
  that 's not the implication , do n't self-victimize so hard ... 
   this same thing is the quran approved way to handle non-muslims in sharia law . 
  ( only let foreigner women come , no foreign men ) , because of the male dominated societal model . 
  deep down inside , i do n't think european hard-righters and muslim zealots are that far apart , ideologically ... 
  it 's been anschlussing since the late 90 's .

  good hardware store and the commercials are top notch . 
  is there another way out of the little bay further to the left of the picture ? 
  cos it looks like that boat in the middle is not going to be able to pass under that stone bridge at the left ...

  do n't underestimate the bohemians in this ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_beer_consumption_per_capita they are solidly , ** solidly ** , in the no. 1 spot . 
  i 've always enjoyed this confrontational quote by playwright bouke oldenhof , from david winner 's curious-yet-delightful book [ brilliant orange : the neurotic genius of dutch football ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/brilliant-orange-neurotic-genius-football/dp/0747553106 ) :  `` did you ever go to auschwitz ? 
  it is very interesting : every country has its own barracks where it tells its own history . 
  if you want to hear all the lies a nation tells about itself , you should go there : holland is the most tolerant nation - we have a long history of tolerance ; austria was the first victim of the nazis ; yugoslavia liberated itself ; poland won the second world war ; and only the germans are honest . 
  all lies ! '', 
  holy shit , we get the entire fkn ruhr ?!, 
  bahahahaha !, 
  yes , please !, 
  dutchland will rise again !, 
  industrial output will raise 500 % !, 
  dunno about derangement ( as in , bonkers , mentally ill ) , but he certainly sounded like a criminal with extra issues before his radicalization . 
  article i read mentioned he was already sentenced to prison in tunisia as well for something . 
  it 's not really * that * surprising either . 
  we 've seen it before . 
  the nice attacker as well was a ( petty ) criminal before the jihadis got their claws into him . 
  i guess young criminals make excellent recruits for them . 
  criminal contacts , used to dealing with and breaking the law , quite often they feel disconnected and outcast from society . 
  prime recruitment material . 
  well , poster is a trumplet , so what were you expecting , honestly ? 
   according to two statements from pilots i know they were good enough to differentiate men from women . 
  girls that are n't adults should be a lot easier . 
  clothes , size , colors , surrounding circumstances . 
  a lot of it depends on how you are looking at them . 
  on a slow , low pass with a good view , you can make out some details . 
  on an attack pass , you might very well not see anything significantly detailed until it 's too late . 
  if you 're going to strafe something you 're not going to make a slow exploratory pass to see what it is first , after all . 
  the way the dude told his oma story made it sound as if some allied pilot was flying around , looked out his window , saw some german schoolgirls , and thought : `` oh boy !, 
  german schoolgirls !, 
  i 'm going to shoot the shit out of them ! '', 
  whilst technically possible , i 'm going to be exceptionally skeptical that that was what happened . 
  the * fact * is that we know very little about the whole incident apart from dude 's oma story , which is way too little to make up some kind of hard , ethical judgement in this specific case about allied pilots deliberately shooting up a group of of underage schoolgirls . 
  if the story is true , there 's many ways it could 've happened , but to relay that story in a context that automatically suggests the worst is rather silly from a proper historical perspective . 
  the allies deliberately targeted civilians =  proof : oma got shot at by a plane once . 
  a convincing case that does not make . 
  actually , my argument against the strafing schoolgirls part is about inability to make out whether foot traffic are schoolgirls or soldiers from the cockpit of a warplane . 
  you see foot traffic , you make a pass . 
  potential callous indifference of civilian lives ? 
  yes . 
  deliberate targeting of civilians ? 
  not really . 
  regardless , i 'm sure there were plenty of individual pilots who dumped their ammo load into a german farm horse just because . 
  people are assholes , especially in war . 
  the crux of the bigger ethical question is how much civilian damage was intended and/or encouraged , and on which various scales did this happen . 
  weird wall of whataboutism you 've got there . 
  what is your * point * ? 
   that no pilots of them ( and with the war many could get away with such things without problems ) knowingly shot at civilians is a ridiculous claim . 
  we were talking about strafing schoolgirls , not knowingly shooting at civilians . 
  the first thing is very limited , the second thing is very broad in scope . 
  you 'd be surprised how dick-all you can see on the ground from the confined cockpit of a warplane . 
  it really is not much at all . 
  especially because you ca n't really look straight down without pointing your plane literally towards the ground . 
  it 's not deliberate if you do n't know what it is . 
  you do realize it 's pretty hard to actually see what 's on the road from the cockpit of a moving aircraft , yes ? 
  all they see is road traffic . 
  not whether they 're schoolgirls or soldiers . 
  callous indifference to civilian lives ? 
  yes . 
  deliberate targeting of civilians ? 
  i 'm well familiar with that side of ww2 .
