  i 'm also well familiar with that side of ww2 being an incredibly common starting point for nazi apologism , * especially * when framed in a few , rather particular , ways . 
  which explains my skepticism when i see people claiming that * the * point of allied bombing campaigns was to kill civilians . 
  you better pray to all the deities you do and do n't believe in that the disarming works !, 
   you didnt ask for more information or a source , you just wanted to expose me as a `` nazi-apologist '' . 
  i 'm not even talking about * you * specifically in my previous post , you snowflake . 
  - have season tickets to old trafford - own every kit from '91 till now - hate city and pool with a passion - can faultlessly name the starting eleven from the january 8th '94 fa cup tie vs. sheffield . 
  `` but i 'm not a united supporter ! '', 
   i do n't mind if you call me a nazi , although it is n't true . 
  white nationalism is n't the same thing as national socialism . 
  white nationalism drowning in jewhating sauce = national socialism . 
  i mean , you 're ** literally ** propagating the `` jews did the stab in the back '' myth , post in a blatantly , * blatantly * anti-semitic subreddit , and then you try to deny you 're a nazi . 
  if it was n't so sad . 
   you seem upset . 
  correct assessment . 
  neo-nazis rustle my jimmies . 
  the evidence speaks for itself . 
  `` yay white people and fuck the jews ! '', 
  `` how dare you call me a nazi ?!, 
  ree reee , this is why trump won ! '', 
  piss off . 
   one goal of the bombings was the breakdown of the home morale . 
  yes , one goal of the bombings . 
  there were actually many goals of the bombings . 
  but for some reason way too many people are pretending the strategic bombing campaigns existed solely to murder german civilians . 
  the bombing campaigns obviously affected german civilians terribly , but the campaigns were also a necessity in stopping the genocidal nazi regime . 
  to cripple their war power and their capacity for logistics and production . 
  if we 're talking about strafing targets , that 's usually shooting at troop movements and trains . 
  would civvies be sometimes get caught up in the mix ? 
  sure . 
  but allied pilots did n't deliberately strafe refugee columns , like the germans did around warschau . 
  war is hell . 
  total war is total hell . 
  i 'm not trying to downplay the horrors the german civilian population suffered under the bombings , but far too often people bring it up to propagate their case for false equivalency . 
  hell , [ the comment you replied to ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5jjodx/giant_38_t_wwii_bomb_found_in_augsburg_germany/dbgs73c/ ) , whether out of poor phrasing or nefarious agenda , is doing exactly that : insinuating that '' * the * stated goal '' was about civvies . 
  never mind all the industrial and logistical damage that you need to do to cripple a nation 's capacity for total war , no no , it was all about the poor civvies . 
  now maybe i 'm jumping the gun on this particular situation , but i 've seen way too much nazi-apologism start with that particular tune . 
  `` but muh dresden '', 
  in the north , we 're just waiting for their inevitable civil war , after which we can swoop in to annex all the moules-frites .

  u/in _ liberty how about you stay in your neo-nazi sub and we 'll stay in ours ? 
  source your statement about allied pilots deliberately hunting civilians , especially , as you are insinuating , that they were ordered to . 
   military and industrial profile [ edit ]  situation of battlefronts in europe by the time of dresden bombings . 
  the white-colored areas were held by germany , the rose ones by the allies , and the bright-red color denotes the allied advances in the fronts dresden was germany 's seventh-largest city and , according to the raf at the time , the largest remaining unbombed built-up area . 
  [ 31 ] taylor writes that an official 1942 guide to the city described it as `` one of the foremost industrial locations of the reich '' and in 1944 the german army high command 's weapons office listed 127 medium-to-large factories and workshops that were supplying the army with materiel . 
  [ 32 ] nonetheless , according to some historians , the contribution of dresden to the german war effort may not have been as significant as the planners thought . 
  [ 33 ]  the us air force historical division wrote a report in response to the international concern about the bombing - the report remained classified until december 1978 . 
  [ 34 ] this said that there were 110 factories and 50,000 workers in the city supporting the german war effort at the time of the raid . 
  [ 35 ] according to the report , there were aircraft components factories ; a poison gas factory ( chemische fabrik goye and company ) ; an anti-aircraft and field gun factory ( lehman ) ; an optical goods factory ( zeiss ikon ag ) ; as well as factories producing electrical and x-ray apparatus ( koch & sterzel ag ) ; gears and differentials ( saxoniswerke ) ; and electric gauges ( gebr\u00fcder bassler ) . 
  it also said there were barracks , hutted camps , and a munitions storage depot . 
  [ 36 ]  the usaf report also states that two of dresden 's traffic routes were of military importance : north-south from germany to czechoslovakia , and east-west along the central european uplands . 
  [ 37 ] the city was at the junction of the berlin-prague-vienna railway line , as well as the munich-breslau , and hamburg-leipzig lines . 
  [ 37 ] colonel harold e. cook , a us pow held in the friedrichstadt marshaling yard the night before the attacks , later said that `` i saw with my own eyes that dresden was an armed camp : thousands of german troops , tanks and artillery and miles of freight cars loaded with supplies supporting and transporting german logistics towards the east to meet the russians '' . 
  [ 38 ]  an raf memo issued to airmen on the night of the attack indicated that a secondary purpose of the raid was to `` show the russians when they arrive [ at dresden ] what [ the british ] bomber command can do . '', 
  the memo stated :  dresden , the seventh largest city in germany and not much smaller than manchester is also the largest unbombed builtup area the enemy has got . 
  in the midst of winter with refugees pouring westward and troops to be rested , roofs are at a premium , not only to give shelter to workers , refugees , and troops alike , but to house the administrative services displaced from other areas . 
  at one time well known for its china , dresden has developed into an industrial city of first-class importance ... 
  the intentions of the attack are to hit the enemy where he will feel it most , behind an already partially collapsed front ... and incidentally to show the russians when they arrive what bomber command can do . 
  [ 31 ] [ 39 ]  in the raid , major industrial areas in the suburbs , which stretched for miles , were not targeted . 
  [ 8 ] according to historian donald miller , `` the economic disruption would have been far greater had bomber command targeted the suburban areas where most of dresden 's manufacturing might was concentrated '' . 
  [ 40 ] literally one of the first sections of that wiki link . 
  they did n't bomb dresden just for shits and giggles .

  that stuff gets everywhere . 
   allied troops were hunting civilians down with they planes . 
  this is some serious exxageration here . 
  also , cities do have , and often * are * , military targets . 
  they 're logistical and infrastructure centers . 
  often rail-hubs . 
  industry . 
  ccc installations . 
  there 's a lot more going on than just nuking civvies . 
  [ this ] ( https://masterbombercraig.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/144fb-britishbombs.jpg ) is a ` compilation ' photo of the various bombs in use by the raf for the lancaster . 
  the one in augsburg is probably the 8000 pound variety . 
  since that comes closest to the 3.8 t quoted in the article . 
  a bomb of that size can do a ridiculous amount of damage . 
   swiss ethnic group lel . 
  switzerland is a pretty poor example for what you are trying to argue here . 
   not true , most sociology/gender studies classes in the usa and canada are just like this you 've attended them ? 
  have you ever even * considered * the possibility that the information that 's offered to you regarding sociology/gender studies classes has been filtered through people who already hate it in the first place , thus giving you a very one-sided idea of what they are ? 
  have you honestly even ever considered that you 're misunderstanding what these sociology classes are trying to say , because angry boys are pulling snippets out of context and parading it around as proof that feminazis want to destroy society ? 
   that 's the leftists ' speciality , by being outraged against made-up bullshit like manspreading and mansplaining , and crying racism/sexism on everything . 
  while they are fighting for the mass immigration of people who want to stone gays and jews and consider women objects/their own property . 
  holy strawman . 
  yeah , i 'm done with you . 
   those far-leftist gender studies professors who say that there are no biological differences between sexes and we should use 70 + gender pronouns made up by special snowflakes on tumblr are probably smarter than me , it 's such a shame that it 's these people who are pushing for the mass immigration of people with mentalities stuck in the stone age . 
  if you would leave your alt-right bubble for more than a week , you 'll find that what you just mentioned is mostly a boogeyman story by reactionists . 
  making a mountain out of a molehill thing . 
  lel , you 're an altright sub poster . 
  i was closer to the mark than i initially thought . 
  neo-nazi scum , just like thomas nair . 
  the_feelsfort is heavily present in this thread . 
   maybe do n't let in people who have any possibility of becoming a radical islamists ? 
  why stop there then ? 
  eu should impose a strict ban on all britons from entering the continent , because one of you might radicalise so hard you 'll assassinate a pro-eu politician . 
  lol . 
  angry right wingers accusing others of listening to their feefees too much . 
  not going to respond to you anymore .
