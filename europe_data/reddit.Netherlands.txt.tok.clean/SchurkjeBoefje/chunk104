  the kuznetsov is a floating nightmare . 
  25 years still is n't old , assuming periodic updates and proper maintenance . 
  usn still operates f-18c / ds and the first super hornets are from the mid 90s . 
  i would n't consider those planes that ` old ' . 
  i see a [ knightly effigy ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wf8ckq2jomo/vvrwoqinkji/aaaaaaaaa6e/y0ht31ty0py/s1600/harewoodtomb2c.jpg ) in it . 
  denk isnt islamist , i have no idea where dude got that idea from but its nonsense . 
  youre a trumplet whinging about the fkn dnc in an austrian election thread on a europe sub . 
  go away . 
  denk is silly , but * islamist * ??? 
  lmmfao !, 
  where the hell did you get that idea ? 
  venturing outside of the_feelsfort today ? 
  so brave !, 
  but be aware though , many triggers out here for your kind . 
  just under rotterdam !, 
  ofc , he can go to the red square and yell that he does n't like the french government , no problem . 
  portugese living in the nethies ? 
  that will be a curriculum question for eu history exams in 2089 . 
  `` which event shaped global relations to a greater degree ? '', 
  classical education is still called gymnasium in the nethies . 
  in this polder or the next !, 
  is that a legit painting ? 
  i see no bacalhao . 
  based top cleric . 
  also underlines the relative importance of interpretation . 
  is this the part where we bring a stiff right-arm salute ? 
  to mention libel and slander laws , threatening and harrassment , etc. 
  i do n't think any nation has absolute free speech anyway . 
  i would n't say created , but meddling certainly gave the extremists something to galvanize around,

  that 's a big . . ` tree ' . . now we just need to find someone brave enough ... 
  wait till the germans find out what 's in the cheese ... ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  you have a fetish for danes ?? 
  oof , right in the feels . 
  we just keep the really good stuff to ourselves .

  ( [ english link ] ( http://www.formaggiokitchen.com/blog/the-gouda-the-dutch-eat-boerenkaas/ ) ), 
   the fbi investigation did n't actually influence the election as much as the democrats like to think people could argue that for years , the thing that matters is that it did have a meaningful impact . 
   james comey withdrew the investigation a few days before the election as if that matters at that point . 
  the seeds of doubt were re-planted . 
  again . 
  all that sticks is the headlines . 
   the majority of her supporters voted for her just because she was n't trump not because she has some significant and strong policies that would have helped the lives of americans . 
  yeah and that 's where they fucked themselves . 
  nl not numba wan ?!, 
  hmmm , but your niedersachsen tastes so good , mlem mlem mlem, 
  why the hell is an american following the eredivisie ? 
  not that i mind , i just worry for your health . 
   the reason why the signs are dutch on both sides is pretty simply - they are cheaper than the german ones . 
  the pennypinching indoctrination is paying off !, 
  yeeesss , yeeeess , germany , do it . 
  become more frugal ... next thing you know you 're eating twice as much cheese , do n't dig holes in beaches anymore , and never win a world cup again . 
  for real though , that shit is a mess . 
  did you know that on average two germans die anually from looking at a baarle-hertog map ? 
  they succumb to the chaos and ineffiency of it all . 
  usually those deaths are chalked up to aneurysms or heart problems . 
  it 's a real hidden killer . 
  [ these are cool as hell ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=trullo+interior&amp;rlz=1c1msim_ennl671nl671&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiihvzovsvqahxbjmakhtk9crkq_auibigb#imgrc=9fmmvirz61wzwm%3a ) one would almost say ... ` gezellig ! ', 
  i 've already told you i have zero problems with die welt or the article . 
  my problem was with how you presented this topic , essentially ignoring the * actual * content and message of the article . 
  the major issue i have with how this topic was initially presented by op is that , for the vast majority of this sub who do n't read/speak german , the * actual content of the article * was ignored in favour of a suspicion-breeding headline . 
  the tl ; dr of the article is :  german gov ' t paid millions to the cf. 
   and whilst this may seem suspicious to people and questions have been raised , welt contacted the people in charge and it turns out the german government and the cf cooperated on climate change research and rainforest recovery in \\* list of countries * . 
  this has all been vetted and confirmed by the federal foreign office and experiences with the cf in this regard have been excellent . 
  the way op presented it was : `` the german environment ministry paid millions to the clinton foundation '' \\* no context or translation * `` is n't that suspicious ?! '', 
  well , no , it 's not , if one had actually read the bloody article !, 
  at the very least , op presented this very awkwardly , chose his words poorly and failed to communicate a desire to understand more . 
  at worst , this was intended as an outright sentiment-cooker as we 've seen way too much of in the past years from both sides of the fence and in particular from the populist right the past year . 
  i ca n't look into op 's head so i wo n't make a hard judgement on his or her intentions , but the way it ultimately comes across is as conspiracy food for non-german speakers . 
  it 's def . 
  part of the general community guidelines for this sub , i believe . 
  but you also commented : `` yes , but it 's still suspicious . 
  money can flow backwards . 
  why choose the clinton foundation before the elections ? '', 
  that sounds to my skeptical ass as if you already had an opinion ... 
  [ trulli in the countryside ] ( http://www.italymagazine.com/sites/mainfiles/trulli2.jpg ) sorry op :( i liked your picture post but i could n't prevent meself making that shitty joke . 
  do people still live in those trullo things ? 
  i 'm telling you to not post foreign language articles with no context or translation apart from a headline whilst in the comments insinuating that `` it is suspicious '' . 
  we can either have a sub where topics are posted according to a set of rules , or we can post anything and everything and then have an unmoderated free-for-all in the comments . 
  i know which i 'd prefer . 
  would n't you be responding in a similar way if i posted a dutch article with no context or translation apart from a headline that says : `` czech republic paid bin ladens '' , if the article is really about a 1995 business deal with the bin laden construction group ? 
  if you were aware of the context of the article , would n't you be saying `` hey now , wait a minute '' ? 
  mate , if you are n't confident enough in your german to translate the proper meaning , why did you even post it in the first place then ? 
  how can you be sure you 've grasped the proper message of the article ? 
   the fbi is n't partisan a year ago i would 've agreed with you . 
  today , november 2016 ? 
  not so much . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump for all the outrage over the clintons ' ` corruption ' , i honestly think you guys ' government is more compromised throughout than you think ... 
  being against misleading bullshit is n't being all pro-censorship . 
  getting tired of that argument anyway . 
  `` you do n't like my news ?!, 
  you must like censorship and hate free speech ! '', 
   all i am saying is that this deserve attention . 
  just asking questions !, 
  why did n't you , as op , translate and highlight the very relevant part that marktplatz ended up having to do ? 
  if you 're going to give this attention , should n't you at least be dilligent when doing so and provide the proper context ? 
  many people here ca n't read german . 
  i can . 
  marktplatz obviously can . 
  you prolly can .
