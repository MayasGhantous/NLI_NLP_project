  what 's the general policy on calling out actual , bona fide neo-nazis/alt-righters ? 
  and i do n't mean `` buuh , this guy said something i do n't like , he 's a nazi '' . 
  i mean posters who go to other subs to post unironically about ( ( ( them ) ) ) and `` the greatest story never told '' , etc etc. 
  if they come in here with some veiled dogwhistle diatribe about brown people or ` degeneracy ' , is it okay to highlight earlier , other posts made by them to let people know where this is coming from ? 
  and not in the manner of `` kill yourself , nazi fuck '' , but more like `` look at what this guy has to say about the queers and jews '' . 
  ideally the court would tell the prosecution to shove such cases up their arse and not bring them to the bench again . 
   generalissimo of the dprk nooo !, 
  you 're kidding ?!, 
  that 's fkn 24 carat gold !, 
  i 'm not against banning super hate speechy things , but i do think it has to be defined * very clearly * what constitutes as such . 
  i think / u/monnaiedechange 's point here is that companies such as facebook and twitter would most likely err on the side of caution a lot , in essence creating a possibility of an environment where much more gets censored than really should . 
  which is a fair concern tbh . 
  if the kim dynasty lasts a very long time , how are they going to solve the issue of having fewer and fewer fancy titles to pick from ? 
  are un 's great grandchildren going to be eternal first janitor of the party ? 
  it 's weird seeing confused travolta with the actual , original background ... 
  dunno if you can find isis executioners who had a sudden change of heart , but ex-zealots are n't that hard to find . 
  maajid nawaz is one . 
  only reason you beat us here is because you bunch of depressed alcoholics have nothing else to do !, 
  we have to balance our innovation with making cheese and putting fingers in dykes . 
  worship of their dear leader ( s ) is pretty much the state religion over there at this point . 
  the irish craic epidemic, 
   sorry , but this sub is no better than t_d at this point . 
  haaaaaaa , what ? 
  do you call your physician a `` piece of mengele '' when the shot he gives you hurts a bit ? 
  lmmfao posting ben garrison cartoons in r/europe delete dis, 
  the mates do n't need to be conquered , they 're taking the eurovision application route . 
  `` four italian eurofighters '' \\* uses picture of f-18s * i am mildly triggered . 
  france has wares though . 
  spain and ireland , holy shit . 
  stop kalsarik\u00e4nniten and go outside already !, 
  the weather is gorgeous !, 
  interesting question . 
  i 'm guessing it 's friction between metal wheels and metal tracks that might ultimately be the issue . 
  in the sense that adding more power to overcome the drag would probably be easier ... 
  i dunno we need a physicist !, 
  it usually starts with a place to ` belong ' . 
  some kind of social environment where they feel home to an extent . 
  belonging to that small close knit in-group gives them a strong sense of identity . 
   do you really think in the 2060s there will still be a place for human pilots ? 
  yes , though in fewer roles than now . 
  mostly if not all in the military , and mostly if not all in high performance roles . 
  a lot of the ` sky-trucking ' , if i may call it that , will become unmanned in the near future . 
  current drone roles will be expanded upon , as one of the drone 's biggest assets is the lack of a pilot means a huge increase in loiter time . 
  for intelligence , defence , support , and direct weapons delivery roles , this is a huge boon . 
  but for the creme de la creme , the top performance craft ... it 'll be a while before the human element loses its edge there . 
  initiative , ability to adapt , those are things you really do need in such cockpits . 
  honestly i would n't at all be surprised if the manned combat craft never ** completely ** disappears . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iaxegvvmna ) of the 2007 record attempt . 
  5:34 for delicious money shot, 
  whether it 's neo-nazis , islamic extremists , or good ol' fashioned gangs , there are so many similarities in how they fish for new members , and the people who join such groups . 
  i have [ these ] ( https://video-images.vice.com/articles/593050ca97924a42940f7b63/lede/1496339909528-cofveve-toffifee.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7574415308291992xh;center,center&amp;resize=1050:* ), 
  not just yet though . 
  manned craft wo n't be disappearing for a long while , despite drones and unmanned craft becoming more and more commonplace . 
  are snickers halal ? 
  use of `` v\u00f6lkisch '' is a pretty big hint, 
   to be volkisch . 
  interesting choice of words ... 
  loud enough to be annoying in plenty of cases . 
  esp when they start early on the sunday . 
  the dude saying `` inaudible a couple streets apart '' must be talking about a tiny church with a tiny bell . 
  late roman republic and roman empire, 
  that 's actually a very good point . 
  superb :d, 
  will this one have equally hilarious fondue scenes as in the original ? 
   nd we 've been blessed with a historical figure capable of offering us leverage on it 's development away from a middle eastern shithole . 
  referring to atat\u00fcrk ? 
  so much of this . 
  japan is a very complicated place , especially from a non-asian perspective, 
  i found the daily mail reader . 
   and we wo n't have to pay people like nigel farage , who does n't recognise the authority of the eu , yet cashes his mep salary without turning up to work . 
  god , he 's the fucking worst . 
  did an awful , awful job of representing the uk 's interests in brussels despite his fat paycheck , then turns around and says `` brussels does nothing for us ! '' . 
  if farage got smashed like a bowl of eggs tomorrow in a motorway crash , i think i 'd have a little fist pump . 
   communists and the jews . 
  pretty sure plenty of daily tumor readers do n't think there 's a difference ... 
  another natural hazard we do n't get in nl , that i 'm very grateful for . 
  forest infernos likes this are some seriously scary stuff . 
   bmw  ( r&d ) ` rudeness and douchebaggery ' department ? 
  if she runs for the green party would she be a. ... ? 
  i dunno if kohl has daughters/granddaughters , but they should try to marry someone with blumen as a surname . 
   but there are some trump supporters out there who have different values from myself , but are reasonable people . 
  i have n't found them . 
  look , i understand the gist of what you 're saying , but my limit with these people has been reached . 
  trying to debate them is legitimately akin to trying to debate young earth creationists . 
  they do n't adhere to the same rules you do . 
  their reality is different somehow . 
  ca n't reason people out of a position they never reasoned themselves into . 
  hardcore trump supporters are convinced the sky is green . 
  i have no idea how to get through to them that it is n't . 
  if it 's hot enough , yeah . 
  whether the circumstances inside ( temperature , time of exposure ) are sufficient to have done that remains to be seen , but it 's certainly possible . 
  your whole body turns into a pile of ash in a crematorium oven , so ... but then again , that 's really hot and ` concentrated ' fire . 
  we do have quite a few polandballers here as regulars though . 
  will / u/badblueboy146 be banning hajduk fans on sight ? 
  no , you are . 
  retarded statement . 
   saudi arabia funded hillary 's campaign by how much again ? 
  are you trumplets still doing this ? 
  jfc ... your boy just sold them 100 ** billion ** worth of weapons , but that 's fine , right ? 
  no no , `` but hillary !,
