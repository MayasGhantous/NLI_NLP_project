  pffffffffff heads need to roll for this shit . 
  scumsucking landlords and the politicians who protect them . 
  this is pointless . 
  enjoy your diatribe . 
  yeah , seriously . 
  looks like the place to be . 
  that people such as you who yelp on and on about ` luxury prisons ' are forgetting one key aspect : you 're locked up . 
  you ca n't leave . 
  unless you 've been in that situation , you do n't appreciate how fucked up it is . 
  and people who have n't been in that situation like to run their fucking mouth . 
  i do n't debate trump aids at all anymore !, 
  i just tell them to fuck off . 
  just like young earth creationists , 9/11 conspiracy loons , moon hoaxers , anti-vaxxers ... much better that way . 
  you 're seven day old trump aids , piss off . 
  go back to your hyper partisan subreddits spouting misinformation to make you feel good while validating preconceived notions . 
  have you ever spent as much as a few hours locked up ? 
  properly locked up , not that your mom locked the door when you were little . 
  no , in an actual cell . 
  ever been there ? 
  ay , the 1870s called , they want their way of thinking back . 
   through hyper partisan subreddits you post in the_tumor and you say such things . 
  i do n't understand how you 've not imploded because of the irony . 
  oooh !, 
  that explains . 
  nice to see swedish fans travel out there to support !, 
  because the ` harmful ideas ' discussed here within context have pretty much been proven to be extremely antithetical to democracy and human rights . 
  the widespread advocating of utter ` alternate reality ' ideas such as holocaust denial , specifically in a mould of ethnic hatred , can be destabilizing to society under adverse conditions . 
  `` streitbare demokratie '' is a lesson the jerries learned well . 
  as a bonus it keeps your old sub-buddies out of the public eye . 
  as a side note , it 's a bit sad that the term ` revisionism ' has become so tainted in more or less recent years . 
  good history is always subject to proper revisionism . 
  new sources merit revisionism , always . 
  but the term has been applied a lot to idiots who have been trying to rewrite the ` popular narrative ' with their own inevitably agenda-driven bullshit .

  yeah yeah , that 's exactly what the fire nation would say !, 
  not fooling me , lava man . 
  \\* puts ` arizona in summer ' on the avoidance list *, 
  wtf seriously ? 
  are n't those dangerous temperatures at that point ? 
  25ish around a coastal area is perfect in my book !, 
  you know what 's the thing about homeless people ? 
  get this , right ... they do n't have a home !, 
  living on the street gets you tanned quickly , esp in summer , and esp in the face . 
  you can see that his arms are quite a bit lighter than his face , not differing in colour much from the swede handing him the shoes . 
  plus , this piccie is almost undoubtedly from euro 2012 in poland and ukraine . 
  which was in june . 
  edit : although , checking the match schedule for 2012 , sweden played all their games in kiev . 
  so i 'm not sure where this pic was taken . 
  might be in ukraine actually . 
   a punter who 'll pay the dosh . 
  appropriate language is appropriate !, 
  yes , hence the last sentence of my initial comment . 
  i also assume the diplomat pleaded immunity because a traffic accident like that would automatically trigger a criminal investigation in germany ? 
  i hope you 've found a good home here . 
  bloody shame it had to be in limburg :p :p :p vati kam nicht mit ? 
  do n't speak the language , but can understand it . 
  i do n't jump over ditches with a huge pole , nor is my underwear adorned with frisian hearts , but i do have season tickets for sc heerenveen :p  these pastries from friesland [ fryske d\u00famkes ? ],

  i 'm not particularly close to utrecht or amsterdam , but i will keep those names in mind if i ever find myself in that neighbourhood !, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.jamuna.nl/ ) is the indian very close to me . 
  seems to be getting excellent reviews on review sites . 
  yeh i figured it might be an impossible question to answer . 
  i do n't think i 've ever * had * proper indian , which is something that needs to be remedied . 
  there are n't many indian joints over here either . 
  maybe it 's the competition with the traditional chinese-indonesian restaurants that are absolutely everywhere here . 
  there 's an indian restaurant at crawling distance from my apartment . 
  i 've never been . 
  i should go . 
  seems to be run by actual indians as well . 
  as a strong black independent transgender muslim woman , i wish i had your bravery, 
  are you indian in nl ?? 
  what should i look for if i want to find a proper , more or less genuine and authentic , indian restaurant ??? 
  are there any immediate giveaways that a place is good or bad ? 
   the far biggest amount of jews has been killed in the last 2 or 3 war years . 
  yes , but the vast majority of nazi victims were from eastern europe and the ussr . 
  apart from half of poland , the germans simply did n't have ** access ** to these people without declaring a war and conquering territory . 
  war conditions might make it easier to conduct a genocide , but war conditions can not be named as a motivator or even agitator of nazi killings ; the killings had always been in the plans . 
  hell , the biggest killings would 've come * after * the war , should nazi germany have been succesful . 
   fleeing the ddr in 1986 you/your family ?? 
  great idea !, 
  on second thought ... `` saumagen '' ... \\* googles saumagen , fears are confirmed * can ... can i have a chicken nugget instead ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  i do agree with that , even though holodomor and other stalinist killings often do have motivations that extend into nationalism , religion , ethnicity , etc. 
  but at the end of the day , there 's quite a lot of ambiguity to be found in the communist killings . 
  holodomor and glf are interesting cocktails of death that became what they were for myriad reasons . 
  whereas nazi-germany 's killings are significantly more clear cut . 
  just straight up campaigns of non-negotiable , relentless , ethnical extermination . 
  not quite sure how i missed that = /, 
  yes , stalinist ussr comes to about 4-6 million , depending on where you lay the responsibility threshold . 
  nazi germany is about 10-12 million considering the * deliberate murder * of * non-combatants * . 
  that excludes military casualties , the millions of soviet pow 's starved , all civilian war casualties , etc. 
  but if we 're talking about communist deaths in total , we ca n't ignore mao 's ` accomplishments ' . 
  the tens of millions of dead chinese do tip the balance significantly . 
  do n't even need pol for that . 
  that said , it 's still a shitty comparison considering the scale and time differences involved . 
   in the core of stalins ' atrocities was nothing but his power hunger and insanity . 
  stalin persecuted everybody and everything . 
  whilst stalin 's fucknuttery was certainly much more ambiguous than the totally unambiguous ethnically driven murdering of the nazis , the lines do blur at certain points . 
  since the opening of the soviet archives in the early nineties , we 've gained access to a considerable amount of ` new ' source material . 
  it has helped to disspell a few myths commonly held about ussr 's , and specifically stalin 's , mass killings .
