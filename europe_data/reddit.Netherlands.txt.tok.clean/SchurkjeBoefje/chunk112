   which lead to death camps and the holocaust as the conditions deteriorated due to the war . 
   also , seat belts do n't save people ... citation needed . 
  scrap that , fifty citations needed . 
   i do n't think this is in any way a controversial point . 
  it is certainly the officially narrative told when visiting dachau , for example . 
  who cares about dachau ? 
  what about treblinka , sobibor , chelmno , belzec , and birkenau ? 
  did they happen because of ` war conditions ' as well ? 
  btw dachau opened in 1933 already ... just saying . 
   exactly . 
  the same way marxism wanted to do good for the proletariat and postmodernism wants to do good for the oppressed minorities . 
  inclusive vs. exclusive . 
  technically , in an ideal world , marxism could 've been good for * everybody * . 
  nazism could only ever be good for `` aryans '' , and it would be necessarily ** bad ** for undesirables ; they were going to be killed . 
  there is no way around this . 
  at its core , nazism is an ideology that largely revolves around killing others for the benefit of ` yourself ' . 
   yes , you in fact are saying it precisely to be a dick and calling me a neo-nazi . 
  and you 've entirely failed to comprehend the point if you think this line of argument in any way leads to nazi or holocaust apologism . 
  no , i explained why i was very skeptical of some of the things you said and the way you phrased them . 
  this new response is n't helping your case ... 
  because hardcore authoritarianism is more at home in the right wing corner of political theory than in the left wing . 
  people like stalin ruled like an emperor . 
  that hardly makes him a paragon of ` leftist ideology ' , regardless of his hard-left socialist/communist economical persuasions . 
  economically left , yes . 
  but socio-politically when it came to power and authority , he was hard-right , just like your average ancien regime monarch . 
  they 're nutters , they will probably be cordoned off just like the pvv . 
  no one will want to govern with them . 
  she grew up around and on the ` ring . 
  probably one of the fastest people in the world on there . 
  `` what did you get for your birthday ? '', 
  `` asiatic hordes and a mosin with no bullets ! '', 
  that 's with the f1 track tacked on , i assume ? 
  otherwise it 's a wee bit slow for wtcc cars . 
  and how does that comment claim that `` the left ca n't veer towards authoritarianism '' ? 
  that 's clearly not what i wrote down , that 's you reading something into it that 's not written down . 
   such as claiming the left ca n't veer towards authoritarianism , i literally never said that . 
  why are you lying ? 
  are you denying the ultra-racial social darwinist aspect of nazi ideology ? 
  are you honestly blaming the holocaust on `` war conditions '' ? 
  t-4 program do n't real ? 
  nazi-germany had murdered tens of thousands of disabled and handicapped before the war even started . 
   the point i 'm trying to get across is that it is very important to understand that the ideologies and systems that lead to great evils are not built to do evil , but to do good to do good for just the amount of people that were racially pure . 
  nazism is not in an inclusive ideology , it 's the opposite . 
  to say it was intended to `` do good '' is absolutely just half the story and at this point , considering the rest of your post , i 'm not sure if you 're just trying to be edgy or you 're actually a neo-nazi ... and i 'm not saying the latter just to be a dick , but you do realize that nazi and holocaust apologism often starts with the things you 've written down ? 
  i 've seen way too many of it , my friend ... 
  but i did n't call anyone a `` marxist-leninist '' ? 
  `` ditto '' what ? 
  do you how words work or are you just special ? 
  well , if you add up all the people who died under the stalin , mao , pol pot regimes , etc , it does beat the holocaust . 
  but for all the eagerness that right-wingers bring up that point , it 's just a really really poor comparison . 
  nazi-germany murdered about 11-12 million ** non-combatants ** during an , at most , 12 year period . 
  though realistically , the killings are more constrained to the ww2 period . 
  the ` tally ' of communist regimes is much higher , but of course , because stalin , mao , etc , were in power for decades and decades ( thirty years for stalin and mao both ) , and the size of china alone means casualty numbers can truly become staggering . 
  and it 's definitely china and mao 's `` great leap forward '' that takes the responsibility for the vast majority of communist victims . 
  however , that said , it 's still a shitty comparison really . 
  though at least it 's not factually incorrect , as the common bullshit trope of `` stalin killed more than hitler '' , which is bandied around a lot these days . 
  still . 
  i just think it 's funny you call me a `` marxist-leninist '' without having any idea about who i am and what i stand for . 
  that immediate knee-jerk reaction in this context tells me all i need to know about you, 
   do you know why it 's the old altright sub ? 
  guess what - they did n't just pack away their things and close voluntarily . 
   they did n't get banned because of what they * were * though . 
  they got banned for doxxing , not for being neo-nazis and holocaust deniers . 
  there 's a scary amount of them , aye . 
  and it 's very interesting to see the difference in their comments ` at home ' ( in their deplorable subreddits ) and ` out and about ' . 
  in their own subs they 'll happily and candidly talk about ... well , all the heinous aspects of their ideology . 
  in ` public ' , it 's significantly more veiled dogwhistling . 
  calling it ` degenerate ' is more low key than saying `` all the f * gs should be shot '' . 
  that triggered you ... 
   nazis did n't start out aiming to commit genocide against any groups lebensraum theory do n't real ? 
   in most of europe and north america far-left , openly stalinist or leninist groups are allowed into the public and political space , whilst their equivalent on the far-right is n't . 
  the usa has literal nazi parties and even the occasional public parade . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  yes, 
  holocaust denial subs definitely exist on this site , what are you talking about ? 
  old r/altright sub do n't real either ? 
  taking over of pussypass sub by nazis do n't real ? 
  for fuck 's sake , the latter had a picture of the auschwitz gates and a jewish stereotype cartoon as their banner at some point !, 
   left-wing genocides lol yeah , people like stalin and mao and pol fucking pot were classical left-wingers , no ? 
  totally not hardcore authoritarian fucknuts . 
  let 's just throw them on the ` left wing ' heap regardless . 
  he 's a neo-nazi ( active participant of the altright subs before they got nuked ) , do n't bother . 
  if it was up to him and his ilk , `` degenerates '' would be in a concentration camp . 
   degenerate use of specific terminology checks out . 
   if we ca n't make fun of ourselves , then we are fucked . 
  life pro tip : never trust people who ca n't laugh at themselves . 
   and the vile muslim invaders and *** the even viler shovel-carrying germans *** ... 
  this ell\u00e9niko understands priorities . 
  thank you , dane !, 
   kaupmannah\u00f6fn that 's phonetically so close to the literal dutch equivalent , lol . 
  though we 'd likely call it `` koopmanshaven '' ( the - s denoting genitivus ; we do n't use cases anymore in dutch , but there are some vestiges left ) instead of `` koopmannenhaven '' , but still , dead ringer !, 
  the biggest proper layer is right at the coast . 
  deltaheight dikes are 9.5 m , soonish to be increased to 12m . 
  there are of course smaller ones in the interior , especially around rivers and waterways , but the main defence is right at the coast . 
  aye , i 've once had some disgusting kibbeling in the hague . 
  it 's not that easy . 
  if your land is below sea level , you also need to have some way of pumping excess rain water out . 
  because a lot of the land used for polders had little ( as in small ) waterways in them . 
  if you ca n't drain those , they fill up and flood the land from the inside out . 
  it 's all connected as you want to be able to ** manage ** your water levels .
