  if they had any actual governmental power . 
   one kills and enslaves , the other sacrafizes himself . 
  there is little point trying to reason with the likes of you , you 've demonstrated that quite clearly . 
  i 've learned a long time ago that trying to reason with religious fundamentalists is futile . 
  way too convinced of their own right , zero introspection . 
  no point . 
  lol , fucking fundie, 
  `` us christians all love everybody , but da eebil mudslims only do ` submit or die ! ' '', 
  your religious us v. them view is so hilariously black and white . 
  well , i say `` hilariously '' but partisan fundamentalism is n't actually funny at all ... 
  the whole ` god made everything a few thousand years ago ' idea is most definitely harmful though . 
  they 're usually climate change deniers . 
  young earth creationists are not extreme ? 
  what ? 
  uganda do n't real ? 
  to read a christian fundie trying to wipe his own alley clean is fucking hilarious . 
  `` not us , but them '' . 
  you both suck . 
  massively so . 
  how did nl and finland do ? 
  `` one man '' backed by the entire weight of the gop and practically half of the voting electorate . 
  rightboye doin me a heckin dissonance !, 
  regardless of political leanings , the sun is fucking stage iv cancer .

   hannibal passed through the great st bernard pass with elephants , and so did napoleon . 
  we remember this because they were extraordinary campaign achievements , not because it was casual fare . 
  does n't the mix of eastern and western equipment in similar roles put extra strain on the logistical aspect ? 
  ammo , spare parts , training ...

  the 16 , 15 , 14 , and 18 generally replaced the phantom , which is a solid 3rd gen. 
  `` tonight , on this explosive new episode , jamal finds out whether he gets to stay in the cave , or gets blown out . 
  and the team task goes up in a bang for ali and rachid . 
  can they save it or will their relationship detonate ? '', 
  that 's a bit much , would n't you say ? 
  ** deep ** centrists ... despicable !, 
  first against the wall !, 
  ahahahahaa what ? 
  if the danny dyer doc is to be believed , football in krakow *** is *** a dagger fight . 
  i 'm voting pvv now, 
  that 's true , there 's definitely a common core there . 
  a lot of the `` think of the children ! '', 
  bullshit with regard to violence and nudity comes from the conservative-right angle , often heavily sauced with religious moralism . 
  the modern ` political correctness ' crowd are most definitely not in * that * corner . 
  the madagascar plan was wholly unrealistic though . 
  in no way could it support the amount of people the plan was intended for . 
  it even says so right in your link . 
  deporting hundreds of thousands , let alone millions , to madagascar would 've been virtually identical to a death sentence anyway . 
  i guess these are the new world powers in that case :  rank country potato production [ tonnes ] 1 china 95,987,500 2 india 45,343,600 3 russian federation 30,199,100 4 ukraine 22,258,600 5 united states 19,843,900 6 germany 9,669,700 7 bangladesh 8,603,000 8 france 6,975,000 9 netherlands 6,801,000 10 poland 6,334,200, 
  i think it 's more the other way around : capitalizing nouns used to be common , but then a lot of languages dropped it whilst some kept it . 
  could be wrong tho, 
  unless i 'm severely mistaken , the english `` fuck '' has its roots in germanic , from the same fruit that give us ` ficken ' in modern german and ` fokken ' ( to breed , used esp in the context of animals ) in modern dutch . 
  ffs , do n't give the terrorists any ideas !, 
  there 's a * lot * of ` micro breweries ' in the usa so i 'd imagine one should be able to find something good in most places in the states . 
  though i guess it 's not * as * easy as strolling into a supermarket and picking up a case of reinheitsgebot goodness . 
  most american big brands are n't fit enough to wash a hippo with , but do n't underestimate small breweries in the us and the quality they put out . 
  a beerlover in the usa is n't condemned to bud light and pabst blue ribbon for all eternity . 
  there was actually quite a lot of that , on all sides . 
  it does look oddly cartoonish , with just his head on fire and all . 
  obscuring of the face also helps dehumanize the poor bastard . 
  it 's something you could 've seen in a family guy or south park episode , followed by a weird quip about why his head was on fire .

  17 day t_d account . 
  very transparent . 
  ignore the troll account , mate . 
  it is for neo-nazis . 
  because to them bankers are jews . 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/debatealtright/comments/67wb8m/jews_and_banking/  i just had a guy tell me the top 10 world banks are in fact not run by jews . 
  i kinda find this hard to believe but do not have the facts to counter his claims at the moment . 
  can someone help me out and state the biggest connection between jews and world banks ? 
  `` joooooooooooooooooooooooooooze '' https://np.reddit.com/r/pussypass/comments/67rwsa/fun_fact_in_all_income_categories_for_the_sats/dgtmn15/  very well , but being a former `` alt right '' member , you must be aware that jews make up 40 % of the top 1 % in the us . 
  even if you think the rich in general are to blame , it again leads back to jews . 
  `` jooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooze '' go back to your neo-nazi subs . 
  it is , it 's tumor from t_d . 
  lol, 
  admiring germans is one thing but self-identifying with national-socialism is definitely beyond the pale . 
  though ... i suppose it 's , in a way , better than those idiots who adhere to practically every tenet of nazism , yet get really offended when they 're called neo-nazis . 
  i guess at least this one is honest ? 
  it 's incredibly hypocritical , that 's the point . 
  these people do n't practice what they preach , despite preaching very loudly . 
  the idiotic backlash against france back then was a strong clue how ridiculously partisan and close-minded the american conservative landscape had become . 
  `` high horse specimens '' , lol you never understood the point when someone points out the blatant hypocrisy of the crowd that loves to yell about pulling yourself up by your boot straps to single mothers ( `` cos hands off of ** my ** money !, 
  '' ) , yet at the same time has no problem with far-reaching corporate welfare ? 
  really ? 
  you 've * never * been able to understand that ? 
  yeh i 'm not saying the eu should kick hungary out tomorrow , but surely at the same time the onus is on the hungarian people to stop rewarding orbanesque politicians ; regardless of actual political affiliation , once they start flirting with and implementing oppressive measures , you need to kick them to the kerb . 
  if that does n't happen in the somewhat near-future ... harder questions may need to be asked . 
   there are very few free media outlets and the election system has been changed to favour them heavily . 
  cynical me would say that a country with these kind of oppressive restrictions should n't be in the eu at all until they have a proper , free democracy in all its facets . 
  check ` controversial ' comments and you 'll find half of t_d and the alt-right dragging out all their tumors for everyone to see . 
  lmmfao \\ ^ this one ^ posts in incels . 
  so alpha , very maga . 
  ^ one month old t_d account . 
  it 's typical how many of them reply with the same talking points , around the same time , with a shared absence of any post history in the europe sub . 
  almost as if they 're coordinated to come here to push a certain agenda . 
  it 's a neo-nazi . 
  check this gem by him : https://np.reddit.com/r/debatefascism/comments/6epip0/what_makes_jews_so_different_from_the_other_races/dic6g10/  the same cause that drives germans to be germans and chinese to be chinese .
