  they ca n't be anything else than jews because that 's their nature . 
  its like asking why a lion behaves like a lion and a rat like a rat . 
  if you think races and genes dont have influence ... go travel . 
  go work in germany , or live in germany for some years , tell me the germans do n't have an order to them , how they work , etc. . . compared to going to ghana or senegal . 
  go to china or japan and look at the way people behave there . 
   i actually speak with a number of influential jews ( friends of family members , we go out with my family on trips , etc , and will discuss politics ) , and most of the stuff they believe feels heartfelt , even if its batshit insane to any conservative or nationalist . 
  i know this rich jewish doctor , living in a 100 % white neighborhood in a european country , he is 100 % capitalistic and made his wealth off capitalism . 
  yet politically he is far left . 
  he is 100 % `` socialistic '' , wants mass immigration , finds christianity `` backwards '' , and will tell you socialistic drivel all day . 
  even though he has nothing of the socialistic background ( working class gentiles , etc ) . 
   and the funniest part is , after saying all that socialistic drivel , he will go and place his cash in various tax havens to avoid paying them . 
  he gloats about not paying lots of taxes whilst being a so called socialist . 
  he also frequently disses the working class he supposedly loves , saying how he hates `` simple minded '' policemen and `` cannon-fodder '' soldiers . 
  guy also stole a watch at a local pool ( that was forgotten by someone ) instead of giving it back ( despite being a millionaire ) , saying `` fools deserve to be stolen from '' . 
   these people are incredible but only jews can be that . 
  double faced in a way , like there is always schizophrenia of some sort in them . 
  they are incredibly cunning and relatively smart individuals . 
  they can tell you a bold faced lie in your face and then be proud internally about how they fooled you . 
   i could go on and on about what i witnessed from them . 
  at the same time , despite being so dangerous , they can be hilarious individuals in a way . 
  boring is definitely not the word for them . 
  `` jooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooze '' also has a swastika `` national-socialism '' flair on that sub . 
  it even self-identifies as a neo-nazi . 
  is terminaal en besmettelijk . 
  7 day old account with ** one ** post . 
  lol, 
  this is bad trump trolling ... go back to the_dunce, 
   they want less involvement of the administration unless it helps big business , of course . 
  they 're all for corporate welfare !, 
  that 's kind of the point . 
  trump 's place looks like a caricature or a stereotype of a rich person 's house . 
  `` i know more about isis than the generals '' much humble , very wow, 
  it 's not so much the black jews part that makes them nutters , it 's their insane racial ideology that does the job . 
  nl pretty much stopped using them a few years ago . 
  they 're still legal tender ofc , they 're just not around much at all . 
  i barely even use the 5ct coins . 
  i put them in a little box that i take to the bank once it 's full . 
  ah right . 
  yeah , seems to be the same wider group . 
  the ones in the docu i saw were really far off the deep end too though . 
  would n't shut up about how the white man is the devil and how black man 's rule is going to be ` justice ' and when jamali pressed the dude on what ` justice ' was going to mean he essentially said it was going to be killing white folk . 
  other factions of the `` black israelites '' might be a lot less violently inclined , but these mufuckas were virtually indistinguishable from a black kkk . 
  nah , it was part of [ jamali maddix ' ] ( https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5836dec415d5db57b19ddfe0/5836df3959cc684019d50f82/5836e1608419c2f3cb5d115a/1482055673839/jamalimaddix.jpg ) [ `` hate thy neighbours '' series ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6507028/ ) . 
  black israelites go a helluva lot further than rastafarianism does , mate . 
  definitely crazier than regular stuff . 
  esp because of the intense hatred embedded in their philosophy . 
  and even though it 's `` responsive hatred '' instead of `` pro-active hatred '' , their hatred still burns with a very bright flame . 
  black israelites !, 
  i saw a docu on them the other day . 
  total nutters . 
  could n't have said it better . 
  it 's not about saving the * planet * . 
  the planet will be fine , it 's about saving our own dumb asses and we better pray to all the deities we ever had that we even ** can ** . 
  a few months ago i showed my father this quote and somewhere halfway through the 6th sentence the man just burst out laughing , and did n't quit until he finished ` reading ' the quote . 
   i 'm not sure what that makes me . 
  \\* checks flair * lgbt !, 
  no , you said `` you advocate us to surrender to islam . '', 
  directly to / u/kareemill . 
  are you implying he is advocating daesh ideology with his post ? 
  can you point me to where he said that we should surrender to islam ? 
   iceland is a very clear outlier for fish , but not quite a world champion ( almost , though ) japan ? 
  no , the point is why muslims are ruthless invaders to you when in reality what they did was no different to what pretty much everyone did back then . 
  not to mention the condensing of time . 
  to stake a 400 year old and highly spurious ` defence claim ' 3000km away under some vague and extremely inconsistent umbrella of faith is ridiculous within the grand scheme of world history . 
  it 's a gross simplification of our collective history in an effort to make a blatant political point . 
  as deplorable as it is , arms deals are a way to cultivate influence . 
  r/askhistorians is legit . 
  not to mention , the post makes a good point : why do your christians get to be the rightful rulers but the muslims are the ruthless invaders ? 
  double standard . 
  to make a political point . 
  blatant . 
  very unhistorical . 
  shamefur dispray . 
   the crusades were an instance of justified self-defense because christians had possessed the levant , as well as much of the middle-east , prior to the ravenous conquests of mohammed and his successors this is so ridiculously black and white . 
  you 're trying to condense an even now still not fully understood topic into a one sentence clear cut case . 
  it 's just ... no . 
  this is n't how the world works . 
  you 're talking in terms of rigid us v. them blocks again , spanning hundreds of years and lumping everything into two camps . 
  it 's preposterously simplistic . 
  maybe [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2lz2ix/i_saw_this_article_about_the_crusades_posted_on/cm0cc97/ ) will help you . 
   i just do n't get your point . 
  that it 's a messy decision about the lesser of two evils . 
  the weird thing is that the regime is doing that with significant support of the population . 
  the ksa is n't your ` standard ' oppressive regime , where the people in charge oppress the freedom-desiring majority . 
  the saudi royals are no friends of the radical clergy . 
  destabilize the saudi royals , who do you think is going to take over ? 
  `` ca n't be much worse '' ? 
  yes , yes it can . 
   ust because they fund a mosque in some next country does n't mean they 're sending out isis recruiters . 
  the saudi government is n't sending out isis recruiters , but obviously elements of the saudi clergy are heavily involved in extremely dubious things . 
   i 'd be in favour of a boycott of the entire country myself at this point . 
  what do you think will happen if that course of action is pursued ? 
  who do you think will take over if the current saudi regime is destabilized ? 
  of course it 's insanely simplistic , that 's the only way the far-right can condense the complexity * and * many unknowns into an easy ` us v. them ' soundbite . 
  i 've seen the notion pop up a lot recently . 
  `` crusades were just self-defence !, 
  muslims bad ! '', 
  if the crusades were legitimate self-defence , by that same logic muslims have the right to come to europe and fight if they perceive it to be in self-defence . 
  do you wish to pursue that line of argumentation ? 
  lucky luciano played a part in this , no ?
