  cozying up to the sicilian mafia on behalf of the us government ? 
  crazy thing is that the saudi leaders partially encouraged the export of wahhabism because that diverted some of the madhatters ' attention away from internal issues . 
  the ruling saudis have their own problems with them ; the madhatter clerics are very influential . 
  those are the really real bad guys , not the saudi leadership . 
  it 's not so much about the stance itself , it 's about the insane hypocrisy . 
  [ this is the most succint example ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2017/04/11/daily-202-reflexive-partisanship-drives-polling-lurch-on-syria-strikes/58ec27d4e9b69b3a72331e6e/?utm_term=.c50ff27a7a74 )  in 2013 , when barack obama was president , a washington post-abc news poll found that ** only 22 percent of republicans supported the u.s. launching missile strikes against syria ** in response to bashar al-assad using chemical weapons against civilians . 
   a new post-abc poll finds that ** 86 percent of republicans support donald trump 's decision to launch strikes on syria ** for the same reason . 
  only 11 percent are opposed . 
   -- overall , a bare 51 percent majority of u.s. adults support the president 's action in our new poll . 
  in 2013 , just 30 percent supported strikes . 
  that swing is driven primarily by gop partisans . 
  ** for context , 37 percent of democrats back trump 's missile strikes . 
  in 2013 , 38 percent of democrats supported obama 's plan . 
  ** that is well within the margin of error . 
  donny 's entire campaign was about things he condemned his opponents for , and his base gobbled it up . 
  now he 's just doing all those same things . 
   how exactly did islam enter into the levant and come to dominate that region ? 
  was it through arms or missionaries ? 
  through arms , just like the entire history of mankind everywhere is full of tribes and groups dominating and displacing other tribes and groups through force . 
  why do typical shenanigans in the levant give ** europeans ** the right to march across 3000-4000km and pretend they 're the defenders ? 
  why are you highlighting islamic landgrabs as something particular ? 
  it 's what humans have done , and continue to do , ever since before we even were humans . 
  no one brought up ` white guilt ' except you , old alt-righter . 
  typical that you try to mould this stuff into some grand ` us v them ' scheme . 
  go back to your hatesubs . 
  more like a 2/8 to be honest . 
   you 're fucking telling me college drop outs with wooden skulls are better at following regulation and obscure orders ? 
  this heavily insinuates that 's all it is . 
  you 're neglecting the fact that with drone strikes and * especially * air strikes with manned aircraft , the chain of command is full of college graduated officers . 
  in western air forces , you do n't get to pilot anything unless you 're a commissioned officer . 
  does n't mean they ca n't fuck up , or make bad or even criminal decisions , but you 're pretty much pretending that 's the standard . 
  and you 're using it to draw a false equivalency between an air strike or drone attack that went awry and killed civilians , and a very deliberate , calculated attack to kill as many young civilians as possible . 
   the crucades lmao what ? 
  europeans going to the levant to wage war is now islam 's fault ? 
  `` those infidels think we are infidels !, 
  let 's travel 3500km to defend ourselves ! '', 
  if you think the military is solely populated with college dropouts , i dont think this conversation is going to go anywhere . 
  obviously not clear enough because i am asking for clarification . 
  what are you suggesting ? 
  they do n't need to be mentally ill . 
  if they genuinely believe that the innocent go to heaven and god will sort it out , there are n't a lot of moral inhibitions left . 
  anyone you blow up who deserves it , deserves it . 
  anyone who does n't , god will take care of them and they go to heaven . 
  and heaven is fucking * awesome * !, 
  with that logic , shooting a pregnant woman does n't really matter anymore . 
  they 're almost doing her a favour . 
  recruiters definitely focus on the ` weak ' ( just like many other extremist groups do , neos , kkk , all kinds of gangs ) because they can be easily convinced and molded . 
  but the ` weak ' are n't automatically mentally ill . that 's a dangerous trap we must avoid . 
  are you suggesting the us/uk militaries are * deliberately * carrying out strikes on children ? 
   when the us/uk do drone strikes they differentiate whether or not kids are playing with rocks on the street near by ? 
  you 'd probably be amazed how restrictive those rules of engagement can be . 
  not to mention that military strikes do n't * deliberately * target children . 
  some users are already politicizing this thread very hard . 
  [ nonsense ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2lz2ix/i_saw_this_article_about_the_crusades_posted_on/ ) get your far-right political talking points out of my goddamn history . 
  i can definitely see that too , there 's tons of them . 
  what stands out for me is `` holly '' and `` dorothy '' commenting on facebook with terminology that seems more like a cleaned up version of what cuckslayer420 would say . 
  would the fox news addicted elderly really use terms like `` liberal tears '' ? 
  that just seems way to recent of a phrase . 
  how old are the dorothys you know ? 
  yes , i get that , i know ; i just do n't think `` holly '' and `` dorothy '' are legit accounts . 
  it 's just that the people i expect to be crooning about ` librul tears ' are cuckslayer420 or magagod1776 or molonlabe88 . 
  not holly and dorothy . 
  who even is called `` dorothy '' anymore ? 
  that 's a name for old people . 
  i would n't be surprised if a lot of comments like that are bots . 
  do we really think `` holly '' and `` dorothy '' care * that much * about ` liberal tears ' ? 
  i seem to have been shadowbanned on / r/thenetherlands :(, 
  big babies master race !, 
  there 's certainly a core of truth to that aspect ; it feels so preventable , right ? 
  like , just the application of a wee bit of common goddamn sense ( 7month old at 9lbs , who looks at that and goes `` that seems okay ! '' ), 
  would 've avoided this drama . 
  the idea that two people are so caught up in their retarded self-righteous homeopathy arrogance that it leads to ... this ... is most definitely insanely infuriating . 
  at least one can argue that child murdering pedophiles , as extremely reprehensible as their actions are , are * probably * seriously mentally ill in many regards . 
  but wtf is this couple 's excuse ? 
  you might even be able to find it with english subs . 
  that 's how all the kids of my generation learned english . 
  the ( mostly american ) cartoons on tv back then were all in english with dutch subs . 
  made it easy to learn . 
  these days , more and more kid 's stuff is dubbed . 
  that fahne is big pimpin ' !, 
  nothing makes one appreciate the thought and effort put into our bicycle infrastructure as cycling abroad !, 
  smart !, 
  once you 're able to really follow along decently , do yourself a favour and watch alfred j. kwak . 
  it 's actually good even as an adult . 
  good guy lithuania, 
  yeh , that 's a common complaint/problem : that many dutch people will just switch to english immediately . 
  what might help you a lot is watching dutch tv on a subject you already know and like and understand . 
  watch a sport ( that you like ) with dutch commentary for example . 
   a seven-month-old baby  weighing just 9lbs \\* rage intensifies *, 
  damn , y' all made the long distance thing work for 2 years and ready for the next step ? 
  must really do like each other then :p how 's your dutch coming along ? 
  nah it definitely makes sense what you 're saying . 
  i doubt northern finland has much of a biking culture either , as another extreme example . 
  flat land and temperate weather makes for a good foundation for a biking culture . 
  worst you 'll get here is a rainstorm and headwind . 
  oh , and densely populated also helps . 
  a lot of towns , villages , and hamlets are a figurative stone 's throw away from each other . 
  you can go on like a 40km cycling trip and pass through a dozen places , easily . 
   so i am moving to the netherlands in 2 weeks . 
  education , work , love ?
