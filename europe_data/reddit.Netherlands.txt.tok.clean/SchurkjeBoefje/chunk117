  and where exactly ? 
   what is something we should try while we are there ? 
  stock up on * hygge * as it 's excellent practice for ** gezelligheid ** !, 
  `` psst !, 
  is practically a meme . 
  the bags hanging off the rear of the frame are already full . 
  ca n't wear a backpack because you need space for the inevitable toddler behind you . 
  put money where mouth is , please https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bnatu/soviet_liberation_of_europe/dhoefkx/ https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bnatu/soviet_liberation_of_europe/dhoftti/, 
   i also wonder what pilot has the guts to tell him if he makes a mistake ? 
  the guts to speak up to seniority has been a part of airline pilot curriculum for decades now . 
  at least in the west anyway . 
  the terrible klm - panam crash at tenerife brought it on . 
  where the ` superstar ' klm captain acted irresponsibly . 
  i 'm not denying any of that . 
  that 's not what i meant at all . 
  i was replying to a poster with lithuanian flair and according to what i can find lithuania is majority catholic . 
   that does n't mean we ca n't look at situations like rotherham and the many other sex grooming gangs composed of mostly pakistanis and learn something specific from it . 
  sure , but a lot of comments in here were knee-jerk reactions implying this would never happen without brown people/muslims/whatever , when of course the sad truth is that sexual child abuse is rife worldwide , and that our own alleys are not at all clean regarding this . 
  does n't mean rotherham sex gang is n't a huge tragedy and that hard lessons need to be drawn from the retarded unwillingness to investigate because of an actual pc-gone-mad situation , but there 's no reason for a hypocritical anti-brown people circlejerk . 
  you 're saying you do n't think the argument that the catholic church `` has n't facilitated the rape of even a fraction as many children '' is idiotic ? 
  that the rotherham miscreants have raped more victims by several factors * than the catholic church * ?!, 
  that 's not idiotic ? 
  i 'm not arguing with people who claim the sky is purple . 
  it 's almost as if sexual abuse of children is an unfortunately widespread phenomenon not contained to just one ethnicity , culture , or religion . 
   how is that related to the story ? 
  catholic church suddenly do n't diddle kids and cover it up ? 
   besides catholicism is basically non-existent here . 
  `` as per the 2011 census : [ 5 ] roman catholic -- 77.2 % ( 2,350,478 ) '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_lithuania how many lithuanian kids fell victim to catholic priests over the last 20 years , i wonder . 
  savile alone probably made hundreds of victims . 
  glitter and harris were tied into the same bbc dubiousness . 
  the other names are from the uk football abuse scandal . 
  fuck knows how many victims those men made in total . 
  possibly hundreds more . 
  what an idiotic comment . 
  what is the catholic church ? 
  i figured i 'd keep the list contained to the uk . 
  `` boohoo , ca n't deny the holocaust , dae neo-nazis are the truly oppressed ?! '', 
  not that those fucks should n't be buried beneath the prison , but for the comment section to go all `` new europe '' , `` get used to it '' , `` gon na hear more like it '' is fucking retarded considering ... who is jimmy savile ? 
  who is rolf harris ? 
  who is gary glitter ? 
  who is barry bennell ? 
  who is eddie heath ? 
  who is bob higgins ? 
  who is hugh stevenson ? 
  who is jim mccafferty ? 
  who is michael carson ? 
  who is ted langford ? 
  who is harry dunn ? 
  who is jim torbett ? 
  who is gordon neely ? 
  who is gerald king ? 
  who is frank cairney ? 
   some ridiculous assumptions . 
  okinawa do n't real ? 
  red-3 , checking in . 
  haring is a big thing in most of nl and def . 
  all the coastal provinces . 
  whether they call it `` hollandse nieuwe '' or not . 
  west-flemish is def . 
  pushing the boundaries of mutual intelligibility !, 
  wtf lol !, 
  there 's also a bangor in northern ireland , i always thought it was that bangor that the maine version got its name from . 
  but according to ye ol' wiki it 's not named after either of the ` old ' bangors but after the title of a hymn . 
   the nazis would completely exterminate the polish  the russians maybe would n't have exterminated everyone  and really are n't better than the nazis = / ` better ' is perhaps an awkward phrase , but surely ` less bad ' is applicable ? 
   it seems like you have some admiration toward the soviets as if they did eastern europe a favor . 
  where are you getting this from though ? 
  is pointing out what would 've happened under generalplan ost suddenly admiring soviet oppression ? 
  tinfoil hattery could suggest that nigel 's ferocious hate-boner for the eu has been funded and supported by \u043f\u0430\u043f\u0430 putin for a while now . 
   you 're saying soviets are good because nazis are worse . 
  no i 'm not ? 
  i 've never understood this weird logic . 
  messi is a better football player than \u00d6zil , ergo \u00d6zil must be crap ? 
   and to me it 's becoming less and less clear on why . 
  \\* dons tinfoil hat * i have theory about this , * tovarish *, 
  `` petey , did you take that cookie ? '', 
  `` cookie ? '', 
  ------------------------------------------------- `` petey , did you take that cookie ? '', 
  `` what are you talking about , i know of no cookie , this is horse shite , what really matters is what happened to the chocolate cake two weeks ago , how dare you talk to me about cookies '' ------ one of these replies is more suspicious than the other . 
  same , but with the third stage that i realize i have american mates , so i get angry again . 
  for all the shitassery of paranoid homocidal maniac josef stalin , a lot of people seem to forget that the pretty much all ethnicities and nationalities attached to the ` soviet ' moniker of the time were literally in a war for their sheer survival . 
  the nazis did n't * just * want the baku oil fields , or the grain of ukraine , or stalin 's scalp on a platter ; they were going to kill and enslave you all . 
  all . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  post ww2 soviet occupations were brutal and reprehensible and responsible for a huge amount of social and political oppression and death . 
  one on the other hand , there 's generalplan ost . 
  what do you think a few decades of generalplan ost policy would result in ? 
  soviets had whores and brothels as well . 
  and germans raped a metric buttload of people as well . 
  when talking about sexual violence on the eastern front , there 's little to separate nazi germany and stalinist ussr . 
  either in terms of depravity or scope . 
  ah yes , forcing swathes of eastern european girls and women into forced prostitution is n't rape at all . 
  generalplan ost was n't real ? 
  the planned eradication and enslavement of tens of millions ? 
  maybe even a hundred ? 
  the eastern front was always the more important front for the nazis . 
  ideologically , strategically , logistically , industrially . 
  the vast majority of german and european axis losses were in the east , not the west . 
  as awful as the gulag system was , the overwhelming majority of people sentenced to a spell in the gulags returned home alive . 
  to say the gulags were used as a system of `` mass killings '' is just simply ignorant . 
  it 'd be an incredibly inefficient system then .
