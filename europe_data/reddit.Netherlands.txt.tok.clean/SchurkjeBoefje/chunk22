  compared to the stealthy buttonpushing that happens in ssbns . 
  that 's why it works in the media so well . 
  i would not equate us-canadian relations with swedish-russian relations , though . 
  one of those relationships is an obvious friendship , the other is not . 
  but yeah , of course it 's just a threat . 
  that 's what i 'm saying as well . 
  it 's barking , posturing and puffing up their chest . 
  as has happened for decades now . 
  the whole idea of a simulated ** nuclear ** attack is very scary , but this one is just one of many , but it 's the one we actually hear about ; and even then we hear about it from nato . 
  now i do not for one moment suggest that nato intelligence and analysis services are incompetent dickheads that do n't know as much as i do . 
  of course not . 
  there is undoubtedly a good rationale and a fair amount of truth to the notion that it was a simulated attack that , considering the attack profile , could very well be structured as a nuclear attack . 
  yet that is a far cry from the type of ` omg russia wants to nuke sweden ' sentiment that some posters here try to attach to it . 
  aye , plan for the worst , hope for the best . 
  the ancient adage of warfare and so many other things . 
  thanks for the replies , kind sir . 
   i would start to worry when whole russian fleet comes to baltic and they start to move troops to st.petersburg :d well , that 'd be ww3 . 
  we ca n't let the ruski 's deny you guys the honourable finnish demise of drinking yourselves to death :p i ^ jest ^ alcoholism ^ isnt ^ funny ... 
  absolutely , and they do . 
  just google `` russia today nato aggression '' or something similar . 
  you 'll have hours of reading fun . 
  as a fin , do you find this threatening , acceptable , logical , do n't give a shit , etc ? 
  what 's your outlook on russia 's aggressive posturing like this ? 
  is it more bark or more bite ? 
  there are absolutely some differences , but the image of evil russia threatening completely innocent and passive sweden is apparently also not completely correct . 
  and for what it 's worth , norway * is * a nato member with technical nuclear capabilities ( even though they do n't own nukes themselves ) . 
  look , what i 'm saying is n't that russia are n't being aggressive pricks here , but if norway , sweden and finland are holding a combined excercise with cruise missiles , * i can understand * russia wanting to ` reply ' to that , even if it 's just out of a desire to cement their big bully stronk status . 
  edit : not to mention that , if sweden 's air defence was lacking in this particular scenario and the russians had some indication of that , i do not find it inconceivable at all that russia would take that as a ( relatively rare ) opportunity to be able to simulate a particular situation where they can penetrate the enemy cap screen . 
  that would actually be an invaluable experience for them . 
  aye but that 's sweden 's problem , is n't it ? 
  do i understand your initial comment correctly in that this russian ` simulated attack ' was , at least in part , a reaction to the combined excercise swe , nor and fin were carrying out ? 
  that depends how good you are with your fingers ... 
   you would have no idea , because we would n't tell you in the first place . 
  we have a winner . 
  which is a fair point . 
  if the situation were reversed there 'd be another thread about `` russian aggression '' here . 
  taotao literally says sweden , norway and finland were holding an excercise with cruise missiles that * can * carry nuclear wearheads and have plenty of range to reach russia . 
  i think it 's only fair to acknowledge that both sides of the fence are doing a fair amount of posturing here . 
  as i said , utterly insufferable . 
  you are insufferable . 
   when was the last time one of the nuke sharing nato partners in europe executed a `` simulated nuclear attack '' on russia ? 
  do you really think they 're going to tell us ? 
  lawl, 
  well said . 
  i have no love for russia , let alone putin 's russia , but people are making way too much out of this . 
  do people really think nato is going to bring out detailed reports in the press every time * they * simulate ( nuclear ) attacks ? 
  `` yeah , we practiced blowing up half of russia last week !, 
  was swell ! '', 
  i 'm sure that would 've been great pr ... no of course , not . 
  nato and other militaries do this as well , they just do n't proclaim it as loudly in the press as when their opponents are doing it . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/445m1l/nato_report_a_2013_russian_aerial_exercise_was/cznw3rx i 'm sure this finnish guy with all his reasonable arguments is slothfully inducing arguments from ignorance as well , huh ? 
  you are very much twisting my words now to satisfy your own desire to throw fallacies at me . 
  i 'm not playing that game . 
  enjoy your strawmen arguments . 
   now , nato 's secretary general jens stoltenberg has revealed that this was indeed the case - a revelation that appears in the defence alliance 's annual report . 
  how the fuck would he know ? 
  i 'm not saying nato is just spitballing and guessing here , but unless the russians confirmed it , he has no proof , has he ? 
  a different flight/attack plan is not conclusive evidence . 
   actually , it is new , since the last few years , as you yourself say . 
  you ca n't even avoid a self-contradiction in a single sentence . 
  considering what we know about russia 's aggressive posturing the last few years , i 'm not sure how you can say a simulated air force attack in 2013 is unsurprising . 
   your analysis is deeply flawed and is riddled with slothful induction . 
  that 's nice . 
  what i 'm saying is that 1 . ), 
  i do n't believe nato one 100 % when it comes to what russia might or might not have done , and vice versa . 
  simulated attacks * are * common , the nuclear part of this one is still a hypothesis , not confirmed , hard cold evidential fact . 
   no , they 're not . 
   no , they 're really not . 
  you think nato or any nuclear nato member is going to release glowing reports about how they simulate their own attacks ? 
  i mean , really ? 
  no , they mostly do that on the downlow , to analyze the results internally . 
  as the ` dubious ' factor of the simulated attack increases , such as simulating a * nuclear * attack , it will be kept more and more under wraps . 
  why is a dzj\u00f6rman asking for grolsch ? 
  you guys make the better pilsners ... 
  i am confuse now, 
  to attach any presumptions to this `` supposed nuclear attack '' still means you 've got just presumptions . 
  sure , russia has been aggressively posturing the last few years , nothing really new there . 
  actually , within the context that you just described , i 'm not sure why people are surprised about a simulated nuclear attack at all . 
  simulated attacks are , after all , fairly common . 
  they really are . 
  you just do n't hear about them that much when they are done on our own side ... 
  brazil ? 
  china ? 
  ofc . 
  you 're not telling me the us does not have contigency plans that they have n't simulated and excercised to some extent , with aircraft or submarines . 
  let 's be honest here , nato itself does n't ** know ** that these were supposed to be simular * nuclear * attacks . 
  it suspects so , and with a fair bit of rationale behind it i assume , but nato about russia/old pact and russia/old pact about nato are two sources i am taking with big grains of salt . 
  they 're not exactly that honest about each other . 
  there are a myriad of quite practical reasons that potentially tie in with this idea of a simulated ( nuclear ) attack on sweden , but the core message that 's being spread and picked up now is along the lines of `` omg crazy ruskis gon na nuke everyone '' . 
  fairly certain it 's a bit more nuanced than that ... not that we 're ever going to know the full details and extent of that russian excercise , because putin 's russia has all the communicative skills of a rock . 
  but still , to take away as the sole message `` omg ww3 hungry commies '' is a bit panicky imo . 
  your population will be put to w\u00f6rk in our windmills and cheese factories !, 
  lol , not on their allies of course . 
  it 's not like russia practices nuclear assault on belarus either . 
  military excercises are military excercises . 
  if you have weapon x or y , you 're going to practice with it too . 
  good craic !, 
  he 's not wrong when it comes to excercises simulating a very wide variety of situations , including nuclear attack . 
  this type of stuff is pretty common . 
  if they really told them to attack police then that 's inciting hatred and violence .
