  axe . 
  i do n't believe in a great leftist media conspiracy , but this type of shitty oversensitive , hi-vis jacket , safety-minded writing is exactly what fuels that kind of fire . 
  `` the new year 's eve attacks , some of which were carried out by men of north african and arab appearance , have led to criticism of mrs merkel 's policies . '', 
  it 's like you said , if ` some of which ' were carried out by men of na/arab appearance , who the fuck did the rest then ? 
  chinese ? 
  the already established fact is that the vast majority of those attackers were of na/arab apperance/descent/ethnicity / whatever , yet the bbc writing makes it seems as if just a few of them were . 
  they 're either purposefully misrepresenting things or they fail at using the king 's english . 
  as a little clarification , this is about the twat that charged a paris police station with an axe a few days ago , not one of the 13 november cuntbags . 
  well , it 's difficult to outright disprove your odd claim since i 'm fairly certain there 's no ` comparison of attacks against brown people in the usa and the netherlands in the immediate post 9/11 period ' , but it 's fairly easy to find a bunch of links about anti-brown violence post 9/11 in the states . 
  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/columnists/sikhs-have-been-living-in-fear-of-hate-crimes-since-911/article4468643/ `` in fact , just four days after the 9/11 attacks , balbir singh sodhi , a turbaned sikh gas station owner , was killed after being mistaken for an arab-american by a gunman looking to `` shoot a muslim . '' the gunman is now serving a life sentence . '', 
  http://murderpedia.org/male.p/p/price-larme.htm `` according to jerry schmetterer , a spokesman for district attorney charles hynes , larme price , 30 , of crown heights , admitted last week in court that he was a `` serial killer '' who slew people who appeared to be of middle eastern descent to avenge the terrorist attacks on the world trade center on 9/11/01 . 
  price originally faced the death penalty in two out of the four counts of murder for which he was arrested because they took place during the commission of a robbery . 
  police commissioner raymond kelly said last april -- shortly after price gave himself up at the 75th precinct -- that he had killed the shopkeepers , all immigrants , out of a hatred for arabs . 
  however , two of the victims were immigrants of indian descent , one was from the ukraine and the other was from yemen . '', 
  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/11/anti-muslim-hate-crimes-are-still-five-times-more-common-today-than-before-911/ https://www.splcenter.org/news/2011/03/29/anti-muslim-incidents-sept-11-2001 look at that list . 
  murder , attempted murder , molotovs , arson , more murder , physical assault , even more murder . 
  that 's one week after 9/11 !, 
  no brown people in the netherlands were straight up murdered for being brown because of 9/11 . 
  ` not much violence ' is an unquantifiable statement . 
  but moreover , you actually claimed the nethies had more attacks on brown people post 9/11 than the us . 
  which again , seems incredibly far-fetched . 
  why the hell would an unattacked country react with more internal violence to an event that happened 3000 miles away , than the actual country that just suffered the largest terrorist attack in the history of humankind ? 
  that honestly sounds as if you 're saying ukraine reacted more violently to the muhammed cartoons than pakistan . 
  it just gives me a big wtf expression . 
   nationalisation is admittedly stupid and has proven to be foolhardy throughout history , but it 's a completely different term than nationalism . 
  because rampant privatisation worked out so freaking well everywhere , right ? 
  i 'm sure that men from islamic/north african/middle eastern backgrounds where the concept of ` marital rape ' is n't even a thing are a lot more well-behaved behind close doors . 
  sometimes i think it 's because this new leftist idealism is not idealism because of its ideals , it 's idealism solely to stand perpendicular to the idealism of the far right . 
  those leftists look at the far right and conclude , rightfully so , `` gosh , those are bunch of xenophobic racist arseholes '' , but instead of sticking to their own actual ideals , they seem to just choose the opposite of the far right ideals . 
  far right folk hating muslims ? 
  then we 're going to love muslims , no matter what !, 
  far right being anti-immigration ? 
  then we 're going to be pro !, 
  i feel it 's an odd form of leftist reactionism . 
  they 're only invested in their new ideals so much as to be against their traditional far right opponents . 
  any * actually nuanced view * of the precarious situation escapes them , which is ironic because the left is often the first side to champion nuance . 
  yet in applying it , this new leftist nuance is exceptionally one-sided . 
   it seems from several posts in this thread that i am far from alone . 
  there are many of us and the number increases each day . 
  hell , comparing my own ( pretty damn leftist ) social environment now with 10yrs ago , we 've all gotten a fair bit more skeptical about eeh , let 's say , ` certain cultures and religions ' . 
  that sounds incredibly far-fetched . 
  uuuh ... no ? 
  his point is rather obvious , as a person of colour living in the usa he 's worried about increased societal backlash against persons of colour because no one is prepared to deal with the issues that too many persons of colour cause . 
  simple point . 
  then you say he has no clue about this , because he 's an american and his situation is not comparable . 
  that i found rather idiotic , considering the hardships brown americans faced post 9/11 ; which is incidentally the exact same thing that lolmonger fears and warns against . 
  so if anything , his situation * is * comprable , * because * he 's a brown american and he * has * a clue of what 's going on . 
  same here . 
  i believe maajid nawaz ' coining of the term ` regressive left ' is a pretty decent appromixation of what we 're dealing with these days . 
  sometimes i understand what normal american republicans must go through , what with their retarded tea party and all . 
  lolmonger has a point . 
  if the refusal by political leaders to address problems with immigrants , let 's call them brown people for simplicity 's sake , leads to a societal backlash against * all * brown people , i can understand lolmonger being worried , being a brown person and all . 
  it 's not very far-fetched . 
  i 'm sure brown americans had a swell time after 9/11 ... 
  i do n't get it either . 
  why are certain ` progressives ' so incredibly invested in defending a group of people that hold ideologies that are the absolute opposite of what progressive western ideas espouse ? 
  yeah , ca n't expect much more from lebanon at this point . 
  they 've went above and beyond the call of duty . 
  i think they make an exception when you 're born abroad to ( one ? 
  two ? ), 
  american parents . 
  mccain was born in panama for example . 
  so people like mccain , cruz would be eligible , yet arnie schwarzenegger misses the boat because he comes from full austrian stock . 
   you can see in everyday life just how gender equality is treated as a sacred thing here . 
  perhaps one of the very few positive legacies from communism ? 
  how did the class react ? 
  well duh . 
  i predicted this when those news stories broke already . 
  if you have a train full of gold , you 're not going to bury it like a pirate , much less in an area that you 're going to lose . 
  why are danish gangs in malm\u00f6 ? 
  replace [ this guy ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03075/gunther-oettinger_3075102k.jpg ) with [ this guy ] ( http://www.biernet.nl/images/soort/14225-oettinger-blik-halve-liter.jpg ) and watch poland do a 180 regarding oettinger . 
  til nethies and belgium are northern europe, 
  not really what you were asking for , but funny as fuck still : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njzf9bm_imo, 
  why would you link me a . pdf in finnish ? 
   someone who has brown skin can not help but be brown do n't listen to ` brown ' music , do n't ` dress brown ' , do n't ` talk brown ' . 
  the culture of your ethnicity is for the vast majority of people a big part of their identity . 
  unless a lil ' dutch kid was adopted by kenyan parents , he 's going to ` act dutch ' . 
  and unless a chinese baby is adopted by a swedish couple , the kid is going to ` act chinese ' . 
   finland needs an air superiority fighter with minor ground strike capability . 
  then why do you have hornets in the first place instead of f-16s ? 
   note that this opinion is more metaphysical than strictly political and social . 
  absolutely , hence my slight amazement that people are bringing * that * view of freedom of speech into * this * thread , which is about the realistics of freedom of speech within a societal and political context . 
  the joke was meh but the way you told it was 11/10 . 
  what are moscals ? 
  does it relate to moscow , russians ? 
  difference between shoot and fire i guess . 
  though i '' m not sure if the french also use fire ( feu ) as an alternative to shoot , as english does . 
  out of curiosity , how would the law look at someone who says phrases you share under typically protected when they were said to a large crowd of ` followers ' ( for lack of a better word ) ? 
  if you and i are drinking whiskey in a rickety old bar in jerkwater usa and one of us mumbles '' `` it would be good if someone killed him ( potus ) '' , we would most likely not get prosecuted for that even if , somehow , uncle sam overheard us . 
  but what if i am the leader of some revolutionary militia at the annual survivalist rally , passionately orating to 1700 captivated maniacs , how it would be good if someone killed the president ? 
  the context totally skews the threat levels of both cases relative to each other , even though the words may be word for word identical . 
  i immediately admit that plumbing the depths of the us president threatening legality is , well , plumbing the depths . 
  but then again , this was about freedom of speech in the * absolute * sense . 
  and i agree that , when viewed as an absolute , many , most , if not actually all countries , do n't have that . 
  but to say that and then omit or disregard the very real differences concerning what you can say en plein public in france compared to nk is n't correct either . 
  there are definitely degrees to it , and to lament that france has ` no freedom of speech ' whilst holding up the rigid philosophical ideal of freedom of speech as an example , is n't very realistic reasoning in my opinion . 
  edit : spinoza was mentioned a few posts upwards in connection to the whole freedom of speech thing, 
  `` good morning everyone , and welcome to the friday gathering of mad survivalist militia . 
  it is my opinion that someone , maybe in this room , maybe not , should murder the president today . '', 
  you can say ` this president is shit ' in public or in the media in france without punishment .
