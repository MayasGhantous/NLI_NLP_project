  the reactions of the normal muslims to these guys was often quite visceral . 
  i still see the old paki bloke getting so mad at the fuckwits he wanted to fight them ( bless his heart ) . 
  the funding of this virulent strain of islam from the gulf states and the ksa is a very interesting topic as well . 
  seems like a lovely train ride with a great view . 
  picturesque village as well . 
  an apt comparison i 'd say . 
  `` and that means something , coming from a german '' lawl, 
  did n't mean to imply turkey was a theocracy . 
  after the failed coup a lot of turkbros on here , from many walks of life , were telling us westerners that erdogan is n't * as * islamist as some of us think . 
  i feel reports such as this reinforce that notion . 
  he 's not a firebrand isis preacher , he 's a populist and opportunist from a somewhat moderately islamic country . 
  that 's a perfectly valid position to have , as long as it 's applied consistently . 
  the objects in a museum have historical significance . 
  but you do n't need to see them in person anymore with today 's technology . 
  you do n't even need to see them at all to understand their specific significances . 
  what 's wrong with seeing the real thing ? 
  have a talk with the priest/reverend/imam / rabbi/techpriest/whatever . 
  you can view all musea objects as well from a classroom with internet , pictures , slide shots . 
  never go to musea then ? 
  for pete 's sake , it 's a an educational trip to a religious building . 
  they 're not going to force the kids to accept god/jaweh/allah as the one god or anything . 
  if this was about a church instead of a mosque the only ones with an axe to grind would be the angry atheists . 
  [ tfw ] ( https://imgflip.com/s/meme/conspiracy-keanu.jpg ) i realize that 6 years of greek and latin were only to make me susceptible to accept the greco-roman pantheon as the one true gods . 
  i have a bold hypothesis about this : maybe , just hear me out , maybe it was connected to some kind of civic course about religions of the world ? 
  you 're completely correct , this is not a castle but a 19th century palace built with some of those typical castle elements . 
  but it 's a far cry from an actual castle . 
   i 've never been a fan of stampot boerenkool get a bag of ( cheap ! ), 
  smoked n diced lardons such as [ this ] ( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/questionmark-api/production/packshots/images/001/076/721/medium/3beb467d0745569c8df1c4d06861fb14e485ebaa.jpg ) and slowly pan fry these on low heat until they 're gorgeously brown and crunchy ( though not too crunchy ) like [ so ] ( http://www.kookse.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gebakkenspekjes.jpg ) . 
  then when your mash is complete , add the lardons * with heart attack juice * from the pan and mix it together . 
  make sure you do n't salt the potatoes cos the lardon juice is going to add the salty kicks . 
  you 're kind of interesting . 
  usually you make well-informed and nuanced posts and then every once in a while a piece of pure breitbartism amongst them . 
  weird . 
  the romans [ would probably agree ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolt_of_the_batavi ) :p, 
  ` leftist indoctrination ' ` the reckoning ' [ mfw ] ( https://media4.giphy.com/media/3o6ztf1ljxr0qb8rec/200_s.gif ) you 're doing a bang up job affirming the stereotype of the angry right wing extremists though . 
  a lot of dutch doctors involved with the euthanasia debate echo very similar sentiments . 
  they have to decide now , but they do n't want to , as they ( rightfully ) feel that they simply can not make such decisions . 
  the patient has to decide these things , not the doctors . 
  of course , even further down the line it 's judges that need to decide . 
  and they say exactly the same as the doctors . 
   destruction of state property is treason get help . 
  like a therapist or something . 
  uss maine never forget !, 
  a the_benito poster calling for extreme violence against people who do n't like the statues of fascist dictators . 
  could n't be more typical . 
   so i can do without anglo prejudice of spain as a place of savage undemocratic tribes , thanks . 
  he never said that or anything close to that . 
  you 're definitely butthurt and putting words in his mouth now . 
  something something reap something something sow, 
   with friends like these , who needs enemies ? 
  succintly summarized what a lot of the continent was thinking after 20 years of uk fearmongering about the eu . 
  atheists for jesus !, 
  what 's wrong with trudeau ? 
  does the street count as a public space ?? 
  and what about actual clergy members ? 
  are they forbidden of wearing their ` work clothes ' in the library ?? 
  do n't know if this is the guy you meant , but it was the guy i immediately thought of : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klaas_hendrikse, 
  oh fucking hell , it 's harun yahya . 
  lock yo windows , lock yo doors i wish him good luck trying to un-gay a'dam , though . 
  he stands a better chance of teaching a dromedary how to cha-cha-cha . 
  the safest of spaces on the internet are those of the alt-right . 
  have you never even heard of the_benito ? 
  lmao , you post in alt-right and your post history is an excercise in sexism , racism and anti-semitism . 
  go away , man ... just ... go . 
  out . 
  off with you . 
  you 're even using the ( ( ( jew ) ) ) brackets unironically , for god 's sake ... 
  i do n't think we should base our expectations purely on the most hawkish elements in either ( or any , for that matter ) government . 
   russians already have a conspiracy theory level phobia towards the us state department . 
  the russian people may have , due to the dominant state media . 
  the russian government is n't that ignorant of course . 
  i doubt they 're internally concerned about typical muscle talk . 
  they 've both done it for 40 years during the cold war , they 're not going to wake up in cold sweats from a bit of posturing . 
  my 2 cts anyway . 
  i interpreted it as more or less regular ` muscle talk ' from hillary . 
  the political equivalent of ` do n't fuck with us ' , not just directed at russia either , especially not the military measures . 
  i mean , let 's be serious , we 're not really expecting hillary to get the us into a shooting war with russia , are we ? 
  by the beard of the prophet , that 's * real * !, 
  i genuinely thought that shit was satire for the first minute or so . 
  mad . 
  putin is n't an idiot . 
  ruthless ( semi - ) dictator , yes . 
  idiot , no . 
  good point . 
  with the amount of electronic surveillance in the area and the general capabilities of modern combat aircraft , i 'm not so sure how easy it is anymore to obfuscate who shot first . 
  alt-right bubble shit . 
  keep shouting about corruption though , i 'm sure it 's cathartic for you . 
   europe can not solve africa 's problems , only africans themselves can . 
  agreed , but we should be able to help them help themselves though . 
  in better ways than just pumping money into the continent . 
  the book ends with our brave sovereign protagonist cutting the ( ( ( globalist leader 's ) ) ) head off with his thousand times folded katana . 
  then he rebuilds society by fucking ** his ** women . 
  words dont mean anything anymore wikileaks is literally selling anti-clinton t-shirts , if that 's not bias then i do n't fucking know what it is . 
  it has literally nothing to do with whether the released info is true or not , literally nothing . 
  but words do n't mean anything anymore, 
  i do n't think that we will get that far with the fact-free politics nonsense ; i have enough faith , or should i say trust , in ourselves to not let that happen . 
  i do think that * should * it happen , we 're fucked and it will be , as you suggest , at least the end of democracy more or less as we know it right now . 
  and yeah , his great comedic timing was something i noticed specifically as well !, 
  intonation too . 
  fantastic speaker with different ` settings ' , great sense of humour .
