   so you 're muslim ? 
   but ffs man , you can interact with the person !, 
  what 's stopping you ? 
  if you do n't like that 's one thing , now saying you ca n't that 's just absurd . 
  i never claimed it 's impossible to interact with them . 
  i can , but with severe constraints . 
  interacting with a person in a burqa does n't feel like interacting with a person , it feels like interacting with a faceless entity , just as if someone would wear a fully enclosed , dark visor motorcycle helmet all the time . 
  you 're talking to a helmet at that point , not to a person . 
  being able to see someone 's face is a large part of societal norms on this continent . 
  i do n't want to see people from other cultures who think women should preferably not interact with ` larger society ' at all be able to propagate their miserable beliefs here . 
  banning the burqa is a step towards that . 
  if you think women should spend their outdoor life in a literal tent , go to afghanistan . 
  i 'm not someone who thinks that muslims should renounce their faith and devour a pound of bacon when they want to live in the west , but i have my limits on what bits of their insanely oppressive culture they should be allowed to import . 
  is this recent ? 
  portugal suffering from forest fires again ? 
  it 's definitely cool footage . 
   the psy-ops part might seem wonky , but it is actually being used by the americans in their airstrike videos - they do n't use the names isis or isil ; they 've latched onto this and employed it in their public briefings as well because they understand the power that delegitimizing the enemy 's identity and goals through said lingual posturing can have . 
  so calling them daesh works ? 
  then why are you so mordicus against people using the phrase online , in the media or in general discourse ?? 
  would it not have the same delegitimizing effect ? 
  calling them daesh does not immediately equate to denying there 's anything islamic about them . 
  in fact , that 's a related yet different topic altogether . 
   of course social and facial cues are important when we 're communicating but the absense of them is not a big of a deal . 
  at least not to take the liberty off a person . 
  the ` liberty ' to cover your face in public at all times is a small thing i 'm willing to sacrifice in order to ensure that we can interact as humans instead of , rather literally , faceless entities . 
  violent extremists such as isis do n't make that distinction . 
  we can see : 1 . ), 
  a european 2 . ), 
  a ` normal ' iraqi 3 . ), 
  an isis fundamentalist 4 . ), 
  a ` normal ' indonesian muslim 5 . ), 
  a kurd 6 . ), 
  an iranian shiite isis jihadists see : 1 . ), 
  a muslim 4 . ), 
  eh , the fbi did a large study on mass shootings and the various factors that go in it . 
  only a tiny percentage are ( partially ) prevented by a ` good guy with a gun ' , whereas the risk of being mistaken for a bad guy increased massively . 
  unless you 're getting significant numbers of europeans ( 10-20 % ) carrying guns in public could one argue it might be of sufficient defense against potential terror attacks . 
  i 'm not sure that the new situation , with everything that will come with it , is all that desirable , however . 
  owning a firearm mostly makes you * feel * safer . 
   no , you did n't . 
  i want to know the reason for ban the liberty that people have to choose what they want to wear . 
  nobody makes you socialize with them , right ? 
  i gave you the reason , you just do n't want to accept it . 
  that 's fine , but do n't pretend i did n't give you the reason . 
   let 's imagine that all the women wearing burqas are terrorists ( because it seems to me that 's the main point of the ban ) . 
   talking face-to-face is flawed too , you know ? 
  are you seriously denying the importance of social and facial cues in communication ? 
  oh ffs , `` daesh '' became a popular term because apparently isis themselves get rather riled up when they 're called that . 
  it 's not a fucking conspiracy by ` our leaders ' * and * ` the media ' . 
  the notion that isis is ` not islamic ' is indeed silly , as certainly parts of the isis leadership and its barebones ideology are very islamic indeed , but the insinuation of a concerted government + media ` plot ' is just alex jonesing straight off the deep end . 
   you 're not answering to what i asked . 
  what ? 
  yes , i did . 
  a full face covering garment is detrimental to creating and maintaining social relations , no matter how short , with the people around us in society . 
   you 're talking to me . 
  can you see any of this ? 
  no , that 's why personally communicating in writing is inherently flawed when compared to actually talking to people . 
  the notion that sarcasm conveys poorly over the internet is a piece of evidence for this . 
  ca n't pick up social cues . 
  i think one can make a decent case for the notion that , in european culture ( not just european culture , but chinese or maori culture is irrelevant in this context ) , it is part of the commonly accepted social mores to be able to see the face of the person you 're interacting with . 
  hell , it can even be argued that within natural social context , the visible face or head , with its potential for all kinds of social cues , is an exceptionally important part of communication . 
  fully covering the face , imo at least , severely restricts the ability of a person to be part of the * social * part of society in europe . 
  it somewhat literally dehumanizes the person . 
  even a [ chador ] ( http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/files/2009/07/chador1.jpg ) , whilst covering nearly all of the person inside , at least makes it clear there 's a person in there . 
  i 'm talking to another human , i can see her eyes , her mouth , when she talks , what expression she 's wearing , etc. 
  with a burqa , i may as well be talking to a penguin . 
  personally i thought the burkini ban was for ( indoor ) swimming pools . 
  not the beach . 
  i think it 's a lot more defensible to ban it from swimming pools . 
  banning it from the beach is ridiculous . 
  well , that 's a bit of a silly point , do n't you think ? 
  if we are fighting isis , physically and ideologically , would it not be insanely arrogant to * not * be influenced by what isis thinks and does ? 
  i mean , ` know your enemy ' and all that . 
  interpretations vary . 
  immensely . 
  the burqa can be argued to be a piece of clothing that is pretty much exclusively associated * with * islamic extremism . 
  relatively normal muslims do n't wear burqas . 
  not even the faux ` moderates ' are fans of it . 
  remember , the burqa is the real ` tent ' , it 's not just a headscarf . 
  [ this ] ( http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2010/04/30/1225860/801122-burqa.jpg ) is the burqa . 
  it 's a few houses further down the road of extremism , that garment , than any other ` islamic ' way of dressing . 
  hell , i thought the burkini ban was specifically aimed at public pools and shit . 
  not the fucking beach . 
  i hold no particular , or any at all for that matter , love for islam , but this does n't sit well with me . 
  if i decide to wear a horse-costume to the beach , are the french police going to come fuck with me too ? 
  anyway , considering the ` burkini ' is a specific thing , i 'm sure it can be easily circumvented by wearing something similar that 's not a burkini . 
  on the other hand , not that this justifies it but i could n't help but notice , if their thing is about modesty in appearance to make sure you 're not gawked at , wearing that burkini thing probably gets her significantly more attention than a normal bathing suit . 
  kinda defeating its own purpose almost . 
  communism was a shitty system held together with authority and propaganda . 
  stalinism was that shitty system with the authority and repression bits cranked up to 11 , with a liberal spinkling of random insanity added to it , until it evolved into a cult of personality around stalin himself . 
  so yeah , there 's a difference . 
  in fact , there 's * so * much difference that even the ** communists ** started a process of thorough ** de-stalinization ** after uncle joe kicked the bucket in ' 53 . 
  if you ca n't see the difference after * that * , then i do n't know what to tell you ... 
  guy is literally proving you right . 
  i 've seen it happen many times before , on this sub as well . 
  people get so eager to denounce stalinist shit ( excellent ! ), 
  that they start to downplay the nazis ( sad :( ) and if you try to say , well excuse me ... there 's a serious risk of , as just happened for you , some asshole claming you 're a stalin apologist . 
  you got ` lucky ' , i 've seen these things turn into utterly awful downvotey circlejerks where facts do n't matter at all and if you 're not on board with the `` commies are totes worse than nazis cos they killed like ... 50 times more people '' , then you 're a disgusting stalin apologist and they want to shoot you . 
  `` controversial '' comment , even though that article was written by the historian and author of bloodlands , which brought stalinist crimes under the attention of the public again in the last few years . 
  but hey , that does n't matter , the source does n't state `` what we want to hear '' , so downvote .
