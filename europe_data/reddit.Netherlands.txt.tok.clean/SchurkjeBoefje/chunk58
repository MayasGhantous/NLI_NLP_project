  you 're even straight up claiming he was a muslim when we do n't even know if he actually was or not . 
  germanborn iranian does not equate to automatic muslim and it 's tellingly ignorant that you would think so . 
  so it 's obvious he 's not a jihadi , but we should n't dismiss him using islam to justify his actions ? 
  i am confused . 
  it 's a valid argument to indicate severe out-of-profile characteristics which , combined with some of the facts that we know , increasingly points at `` no islamic motive or indication of strong religiousness '' . 
  but of course , if you 're hellbent to see this as an act of islamic terrorism , i 'd better spend my time teaching a bullfrog how to cha-cha-cha than trying to argue with you . 
  yeah wanted to suggest this . 
  look into it if you time , xeno , deradicalisation programs are invaluable and they can always use ex-radicals . 
  cnn and maybe fox were literally the only outlets to report that , amid the mass confusion of conflicting reports dribbling in yesterday . 
  he shot himself in the head . 
  serious muslims do n't shoot themselves in the head . 
  suicide is a big no-no in their faith ; it 's a sin in christianity and orthodox judaism as well . 
  edit : i love how this is ` controversial ' . 
  man , some people really get fucking triggered when an attacker does n't fit their preconceived notions to the point where they 're just downvoting facts . 
  go find how many islamic terrorists commited straight up suicide . 
  not suicide by charging at gign , not blowing yourself up , just straight up killing yourself . 
   isis deeply hates iranians in particular because they are shia minority and isis ( whabists ) consider them being so called infidels and a lot worse than westerners and other non muslims . 
  in that context i would n't be surprised if radical sunnis consider shia as apostates , not heretics . 
  and apostates are definitely worse than heretics to them . 
  the point is that a lot of people kept , and still keep ! , pushing the islam angle even when there was zero indication this had anything to do with islam . 
  with what we knew yesterday around midnight , it started to look as if this had little to do with ideological convictions , and still people kept pushing the islam angle . 
  with what we know now , it seems as if the perp was fascinated by mass shootings , was mentally ill and had the standard ` mad at the world ' outlook characteristic of rampage shooters . 
  and because in the heat of unconfirmed reports yesterday , cnn and maybe fox had a supposed eyewitness that supposedly heard him drop a snakhbar , people are still pushing the islam angle , because iranian . 
   they grew up in the netherlands and went to dutch schools . 
  some might not have . 
  unfortunately , religious schools are still a thing here and though for `` christian '' schools it 's mostly just the name these days , `` islamic '' schools are a whole different cookie . 
  not exactly institutions of integration , those . 
  that one lady with the hat felt it coming after `` 86 % european '' . 
  her laugh is doing me in . 
  superb . 
   plus `` dutch dropping here for a looong time '' . 
  plus `` dutch dropping *** s *** here for a looong time '' . 
  ftfy . 
  they say dutch droppings taste like licorice !, 
   the question is why he did n't get himself a rifle . 
  cos he ai n't as smart as you and me ? 
  though i suppose there are some reasons why he may have decided not to . 
  full size rifles are not easy to conceal . 
  concealment might 've been part of his plan . 
   edit 2 : russian flag why :'( you are now banned from r/russia , r/putin and r/rodina, 
  lmao you ca n't make that up . 
  comedy gold . 
  if those white supremacists have such a problem with african roots , it 's probably best that no one tells them where our species most likely originated from ... 
  on a more serious answer : if one is really determined to get a firearm , eventually that person will succeed . 
  black market , internet ( dark web ) , some unsavoury acquaintances perhaps . 
  the 3 suspects thing was tied to a car ` escaping ' from the location of the shootings at high speed . 
  german police tracked the car and stopped it at some point , with considerable show of force i imagine , when they thought it was more or less safe to do so ( probably waited until they were somewhere with no bystanders ) . 
  turns out the occupants had nothing to do with anything and just wanted to gtfo . 
  that 's where the multiple suspects idea came from . 
  police spokesperson explained this at the press conference last night . 
  yes !, 
  excellent sleuthing , my friend . 
  technically they are white supremacists from a protestant angle . 
  so anyone who * does n't * fit that definition is inferior to them . 
  and their definition of ` white ' was very narrow in the first place . 
  the ` second ' kkk ( the most well known i suppose ) was vehemently against italians as well for example . 
  cnn was literally the only outlet that reported it and you 've already turned it into : he 's muslim =  fact . 
   could there be more to the story ? 
  bilderberg lizards did this false flag to take away our guns, 
  it barked like a bulldog , drooled like a bulldog and doggypaddled like a bulldog , but you 're the one here trying to tell us it was a mallard . 
  ama ama ama, 
  probably strengthened by the notion that a lot of iranian immigrants left iran around the time of their islamic revolution . 
  one could hazard the guess that those people do n't exactly hold islamic fundamentalist beliefs . 
  it 's mostly a matter of determination i think . 
  if you * really * want one , you 'll be able to get one eventually . 
  imagine if it was the other way around , we could have girls engaging in mass tit attacks , rubbing their puppies in the faces of unsuspecting passers-by . 
  what have we done ?!, 
  what could have been ? 
  i remember a story ( god , where was it from again ? 
  i want to say usa but i 'm not sure ... < = = hungary ) of either a neo-nazi or kkk guy ( < = = extreme right political party ) that was quite the leading figure of his local chapter of racists ( < = = nothing changes here ) . 
  until dude found out he was jewish . 
  like , properly jewish mother lineage jewish . 
  the lawls what happened ? 
  dude left kkk/nazi organisation ... and *** became an orthodox jew *** !, 
  so many of those fucknuts just want to belong to something . 
  edit : it was [ this ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/csan%c3%a1d_szegedi ) guy !, 
  u/shishko dug it up . 
  shooting yourself in the head is certainly not jihadi mo. 
  suicide is heavily frowned upon , whilst death in battle is enormously fetishized . 
  i do n't think any islamic terror attack in recent history ended with the perpetrator shooting themselves . 
  it 's always either a fight to the death or they blow themselves up . 
  capping yourself in the head is the jihadi equivalent of `` go immediately to jail , do not collect your 72 virgins '' . 
  zero indication as far as motive goes so far . 
   and it was a jihadi , enjoy your life you fucking moron . 
  my , you 're polite . 
  and all we know is he was german-iranian . 
  by no stretch does that equate to jihadi . 
  there is nothing to celebrate about this . 
  their whole world is isis , cucks and donald . 
  they would n't know the difference between sunnis and shias if it hit them in the face . 
  police conference spokesman just said german-iranian perpetrator ? 
  18 yrs old . 
  oh man , that 's potentially some devious shit . 
  myeah , that makes sense . 
  poor wallies tho . 
  so far it does n't seem there 's actually much of a political motive for this . 
  who knows what 's going to come out in the next couple of days , but for now most signs are pointing towards a nutjob . 
  i realize the ` unknown ' factor , but who looks at a wallaby and thinks ` by the gods , what a fearsome creature ' ? 
  hopefully it does n't have any consequences for dragonlord then , since he does n't seem particularly stable to begin with . 
  people like that are probably the last who need false accusations,
