  great contribution . 
  also , it does n't change the fact that right now , turkish muslims , by all accounts supposedly some of the most rational , sane muslims there are on earth , are clamouring for death in the streets . 
  you can tell me to fuck off all you want , but it does n't change the facts that in the most secular muslim country on earth , there are still hordes of exceptionally intolerant muslims who would like people to die . 
  this does not fill me with hope for the future . 
  come to the nethies , man . 
  we have turks here so you wo n't have to miss your food , we have cheese , tall girls and there 's only a 3 % risk of drowning !, 
  looks like the setting of the final showdown in a superhero movie, 
  the alt-righters would be proven correct . 
  there would be violence in the streets . 
  welp , now we now what direction turkey is going . 
  the cat is out of the bag . 
  and it 's absolutely incredible just * how fucking good * muslims are at making themselves look bad . 
  they do n't need trump , they do n't need le penn , wilders , farage , orban or whoever else has a little hate boner for them . 
  they are perfectly , * perfectly * capable of ruining their own reputation much more efficiently than anyone else can . 
  but their concept of death was the same , though . 
  death is death . 
  not the start of paradise . 
   the people who are that influenced by belief to this degree are usually on the upper end of the intelligence distribution , well educated , disciplined and so on . 
  this is true for the original me jihadist generation . 
  bin laden and the likes . 
  a lot of the lower end are heavily influenced by recruiters and groomers , i see no reason why these people ca n't fall for the same notion , even more easier i daresay . 
  we 'll just have to agree to disagree here . 
   do you think religious people are n't afraid of death ? 
   it 's just a cheap trick to insinuate that religious people are automatically fanatics because they 've rationally reached the conclusion that there might be an afterlife . 
  i 'm pretty certain that i specifically wrote `` fanatic '' and `` super serious afterlife fanatic '' . 
  not just `` religious people '' . 
  please do n't put words in my mouth as i 'm taking care to not generalize . 
  and whilst i may not have given my own comprehensive definition of ` fanatic ' , i think we can agree that ` fanatic ' can be safely assumed to not refer to any ordinary person with religious ideas . 
  i 'm talking about the absolute fringes of religious extremism here . 
  i 'd thought that was pretty goddamn obvious , but apparently i have to specify it even harder than `` super serious afterlife fanatic '' . 
  \\* angry stare *  believing that you go to heaven after you die does n't mean that you somehow lower your inhibitions to die . 
  it certainly wo n't supercede instinctual and physical reactions , which may impede the whole suicidal process , but i think it 's pretty fucking obvious that * some * , probably a very small minority of real extremist fanatic zealots ( < = ** not ** ordinary religious people ) are a helluva lot less afraid of death than most people . 
  which is n't hard if you genuinely believe there is an afterlife and you 're on the vip list . 
  i do n't completely agree . 
  i do think religions with a paradise afterlife narrative play a more macabre role in such contexts , because it automatically places less value on life on earth . 
  add divine and infallible judgement to the mix , and death is neither a bad thing nor the end . 
  it 's not a sacrifice , not a trade-off * and * it does n't matter at all if you do it unto others , no matter how innocent they may be . 
  blew up a baby ? 
  does n't matter , baby , collect your 200 candies and go straight to heaven . 
  a fanatic sacrificing himself and/or others for a cause that the fanatic thinks is righteous and worthwhile is still a trade-off , a balancing act , even if it 's callous . 
  `` semi-accidentally kill dozens of millions when trying to revolutionize agriculture ? 
  eeh , unfortunate , * but totally worth it * , yo ! '', 
  that 's an incredibly callous attitude to have , but at least it recognizes that the deaths matter as * deaths * , even if it does n't matter personally to the individual ( s ) that are/were responsible . 
  but if you 're a super serious afterlife fanatic , death itself , for whoever , ceases completely to be a bad thing . 
  the whole intrinsical meaning of death , the definition of death , shifts for these people . 
  it 's got me sleuthing through online newspaper archives now , which is quite fun in itself , and [ a ny times article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/07/world/france-letting-ship-saboteur-return.html ) on the release might actually clarify the situation : `` many french citizens sympathized with mrs. prieur , who arrived on the atoll in july 1986 , because she was sentenced for a crime that was carried out apparently under orders from the french government . '', 
  in that context i can better imagine mrs. prieur receiving a somewhat warm welcome home . 
  the two that were convicted in nz went on to have , apparently , pretty successful careers . 
  then again , they were following orders and the operation was never meant to kill , so one can debate how much direct blame should be heaped onto the people that carried out the attack . 
  so maybe it does n't really matter . 
  also , managed to find the bit where i got the ` hailed as heroes ' from . 
  [ wiki note ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominique_prieur ) 13 that links to a [ snippet ] ( http://newspaperarchive.com/profile/susan%20barnum/clipnumber/38949/ ) of the cedar city gazette ( not exactly the times , i know ) that refers to it . 
  i may have misremembered the ` hailed as heroes ' part . 
  apologies , because that does make it seem worse . 
  though quite a few of the agents were promoted , in addition to france breaking that treaty with new zealand later on , even after they acknowledged and apologized for their responsibility . 
   because here the rainbow warrior story is told as one of the most shameful episode of our recent history . 
  good . 
   but how likely do you think it is , that the key political building burns down completely on the account of a single arsonist ? 
  fire can spread amazingly quickly . 
  i do n't know how much you know about fire , but it 's honestly surprising . 
   you 'd assume there is plenty of warden personal . 
  it was at night . 
  maybe a few guards ( though evans writes it was empty at the time ) , but certainly not heavily protected . 
  why would it be ? 
   you 'd assume they 'd scramble the fuck out of every fire fighting unit they could . 
  they did !, 
  but they could n't do much except ` dampen the ruins of the main chamber and do its best to save the rest ' . 
   but there is ample indication they let it happen . 
  that 's quite an assertion . 
  they would have to have prior knowledge of vd lubbe 's plans , which seems difficult without suggesting he was straight up ` in on it ' . 
  and to be honest , without actual physical clues , there really is n't that much ` ample indication ' apart from theories and could-be 's . 
  forget about hardcore ` evidence ' , there are n't even any prime sources that should suggest a bigger scheme . 
   and they ruthlessly exploited it to further their means . 
  that is definitely beyond question . 
  with so many comparisons drawn to the reichstagfire i 've grabbed my copy of the coming of the third reich by evans and you 're right . 
  he does write that vd lubbe became disillusioned with the communist movement due to ` the party 's strict code of discipline and authoritarian structure , and left in 1931 to join an anarcho-syndicalist organization ... ' he also ended up in germany because he tried to travel to the soviet-union , ` but only got as far as poland ... before he started back , reaching berlin on 18 february 1933 . ', 
  so my comment there was somewhat off and yours was n't . 
  martians could 've helped him as well . 
  fact is , there is no evidence to support either of those theories . 
  and whilst the absence of evidence is not evidence in itself , the absence of evidence to support the ` conspiracy ' theory is exactly that : no evidence . 
   i believe it 's also consensus that the nazis facilitated it to a degree . 
  not really . 
  it 's often posited , but there 's no evidence . 
  history , proper history in the academic domain of studies , still relies on evidence . 
  no evidence , no game .

  aye in a modern day scenario , hanging a b61 under a falcon is n't exactly the scariest weapon anymore . 
  we have a bunch of them at volkel airbase for our f16s as well . 
  do n't really see the point anymore . 
  cold war is over , technology has moved on . 
  throwing nukes from planes is so pass\u00e9 . 
  you 're not wrong . 
  mob violence is a phenomenon not bound by cultures or ethnicities . 
  it has to do with shitholes and uncivilized people ; also not bound by cultures or ethnicities . 
   like being offered root beer instead of cocaine . 
  ugh that was the worst children 's party ever . 
  i know timmy has weak nostrils but that does n't mean the rest of the kids ca n't have fun !, 
  it 's not like those things are just lying on a shelf ... they 're in a bunker , behind very thick doors , guarded by usaf personnel . 
  no one needs proof when the conspiracy hivemind takes over . 
  which was committed by marinus v/d lubbe , a member of the dutch communist party and a known arsonist , is the vast majority consensus amongst historians .
