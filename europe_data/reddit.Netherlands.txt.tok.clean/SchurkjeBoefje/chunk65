  `` ntv reports that f16s have taken down a sikorsky owned by the coup-ing military . 
  / u/trumpete '' if this is true it 's difficult to figure out who 's actually in control of the air force . 
  do n't forget the rhinos !, 
  they have a bunch of ex-luftwaffe f-4 's . 
  we just do n't really know what 's happening exactly . 
  some sources say the coup is well supported in the military by army and air force . 
  some sources say it 's small faction ( s ) within the army . 
  who knows = / opposition parties , even the kurds , have denounced the coup , however . 
  which is significant , politically speaking . 
  and might be a hint for us non-turks just how much bad memories turkey has of military coups and regimes . 
  probably for the best . 
  the crews , mostly , if not all , enlisted , probably didnt have much choice whether to participate or not . 
  and tanks shooting into civilian mobs would just be ... bad . 
  very very bad . 
  a lot of opposition parties are denouncing the coup now as well . 
  this surprises me , but then again i have no real insight in how scared turks should/could/would be of a coup and the consequences thereof . 
  erdogollum might be the lesser evil in the eyes of a lot of turks right now . 
  if the crew of an armoured vehicle , let alone a real tank , just button down ( i.e. 
  close all hatches ) there 's no fucking way a group of civilians are going to get them out though, 
  for real , that shit is fucked up and sounds pretty desperate . 
  as if erdogan is gambling on the idea that the military wo n't dare use a lot of violence against turkish citizens . 
  and he might be right . 
  but he is gambling with the lives of his supporters = / edit : the turkittors on here better stay the fuck inside . 
  do n't wan na catch a stray . 
  unless it 's a cute stray dog . 
  then catch it . 
  https://twitter.com/ramiailoiah/status/754081123630710785?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw they 're hitting a tank with sticks ... not the sharpest knives in the drawer , are they ? 
  i 'm not saying they 're useless , but a group of people with such a high average age will have its own set of problems . 
  i do n't think anyone really * knows *, 
  so that 's what jan ~ ~ b\u00f6hmermann ~ ~ machiavelli was plotting when he went off the air for a week . . 
  i know franco lasted into the 1970s , but did n't know about the '81 attempt . 
  i see more people worried than celebrating . 
  https://twitter.com/washingtonpoint/status/754057248477843456?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw is akp suggesting civilians go and confront the military ? 
  am i uderstanding this correct ? 
  if so , that 's despicable . 
  you guys had a coup in ' 81 ?!, 
  `` we have valiantly beaten back the american aggressor ! '', 
  \\* m1 's almost literally visible in the background *, 
  not to mention that more instability is very bad for turkey right now . 
  and given their history with military regimes , the people have a right to be pretty anxious right now . 
  erdogan gone = good more instability = very bad, 
  it is , it 's basically the combined bosses of the entire military . 
  `` turkish army announces it has taken over the authority in entire turkey . 
  gov ' t denies , says the coup attempt is failed . '', 
  i suppose it could be possible that the planes were scrambled by loyalists ? 
  turkish prime minister just confirmed coup according to reliable source ( my mom ) ? 
  why would you get tanks responding to a terror attack though ? 
  holy shit, 
  oh wow , that low and on burner . 
  something has to be up . 
  you do n't do that when there 's nothing going on . 
  edit : or am i blind and is that its navlight ? 
  forgot sound on first view and it 's not loud enough . 
  in any case , it 's very low and thats quite unusual in itself . 
  `` the hapless pensioner explained to police that she was simply following the instructions . '', 
  god ... fucking ... dammit ... 91 yr old german bint ` just following instructions ' ... ggggnnhh ... 
  so many jokes , so many jokes , but the fruit , the fruit hangs so low it 's beneath the ground . 
  you are aware that the facebook post was accompanied by a very macabre photoshop and that the man in question is a convicted murderer ? 
  for libel or threats , the victim has to press charges on a personal title ; this is something that our royalty does n't do , just as they do n't state their political opinions in public . 
  so we have a convicted murderer in kampen making [ these ] ( http://www.demorgen.be/nieuws/dertig-dagen-cel-voor-nederlander-die-willem-alexander-beledigt-ba57a8b8/ ) kind of posts , just before wimpie visits zwolle . 
  that 's what put him on the radar . 
  but as wimpie does n't press charges , the prosecution kind of has their hands tied . 
  but they * can * use the outgoing l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 law to throw the book at the legitimately scary fuckface . 
  which they did . 
  which i 'm okay with . 
  it 's an outgoing law anyway and the guy had it coming . 
  it 's not the start of orwellian practices , if anything it 's a vestige of them . 
  but people read the title and go full panic mode ; `` hurr durr muh free speech '' and equating it with erdogan , who * personally * pressed cases , numbering in the hundreds , against detractors and critics . 
  it 's two completely different things , but muh hivemind . 
  do you have any actual arguments or just strawmen and accusations of hypocrisy ? 
   so then you think dictator erdogan was right . 
  you do n't get to tell me what i think . 
  fuck off with that noise . 
  sure , i 'm on the same line with erdogan and wrong . 
  well argued . 
  read up on the context of the case and then come back to me , okay ? 
  lol # 2, 
  lol, 
  and he 's german or austrian . 
  who wants to erode civil liberties to ` fight ' a specific group of people to ` protect society ' . 
  low hanging fruit if there ever was some ... 
  i never said the pira wasnt responsible for civilian casualties , though . 
  i 'm not sure what your point is here . 
  `` the guildford pub bombings occurred on 5 october 1974 . 
  the provisional irish republican army ( ira ) detonated two 6-pound gelignite bombs at two pubs in guildford , surrey , southwest of london . 
  ** the pubs were targeted because they were popular with british army personnel stationed at the barracks in pirbright . 
  do you have a horn growing out of your forehead and do you shit rainbows by any chance ? 
  \\* gets a selfie with you *, 
  ah right , in the sense of ` now you 're here in ireland , and you pick the brew that you can buy in the supermarket at home . 
  you wanker ' . 
  yeah i can agree . 
  langers then . 
  but what 's with the guiness hate ? 
  wait what , is guinness not popular in ireland ? 
  or is it a local thing where the corkists ( ? 
  prefer a local brew over the guinness ? 
  so you 're an american in favour of banning all gun ownership ? 
  am i understanding this correctly ? 
  old as fuck , though . 
  average age of 69 , 70 .
