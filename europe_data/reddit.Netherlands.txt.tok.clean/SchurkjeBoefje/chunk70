  even jupiter himself could n't bend that one in after that run-up ; the primordial gods of the universe wo n't allow it . 
  there are rules and limits , and zaza broke them . 
  that one was definitely special , and not in a good way . 
  i called it during the run-up , that it would be a miss , because how can it go otherwise with such a run-up ? 
  one of the poorest pk shootouts i 've ever seen . 
  some of those spotkicks were just ... what the actual fuck ? 
  zaza 's , pelle 's , m\u00fcller 's ... just ... godawful . 
  sure , exhaustion plays a part but still . 
  all he does is complain , and some of his complaints are justified , but his solutions are often just borderline retarded . 
  no thought , no vision , all emotional ` reasoning ' . 
   but who cares if it 's good guys like usa attack , right ? 
  seriously ? 
  under which fucking rock have you been living the past 15 years ? 
  in which deep , hidden crevasse have you been holed up ? 
  did you actually miss the global outrage that stemmed from the us invasion of iraq ? 
  i mean , what the actual fuck , how can you even say such stupid things ? 
  he 's russian and if i were more tinfoily inclined i 'd call him a putin shill . 
  absolutely bonkers . 
  wilmots joins hodgson as worst managers of the tournament imo . 
  savagely underperformed given the quality of their squads . 
  wilmots played his team way too typically belgian ( regarding footy at least ) : conservative and lacking in confidence . 
  lol !, 
  eh well , they just did one anyway . 
  hunt-gove sounds a lot like cunt cove , which is the tiny inlet somewhere on the northwestern coast where you guys should leave those two wankpeddlers . 
  the eu is very big and sure , there are some dubious ties to big business abound , but at the same time the eu also tries to rein megacorp in on multple occasions . 
  but much more interestingly , if you object to the eu 's supposed ` privileged treatment ' of megacorp and their ilk , what the fuck do you think a tory government is going to do ? 
  `` fuck big business , out of the eu and let 's have the neo-liberal tories ! '', 
  you never did the 12 steps before ? 
  pffff , what is this , amateur hour ? 
  i 've been thinking about picking up eu4 during the steam sales as well , but it seems like a time-eater and i have so many games that i still need to play , lol...re-installed rome ii yesterday with the divide et impera mod too ... 
  one could write a very similar diatribe about the utter uselessness of metal music . 
  whilst i agree that semi-actively wishing death upon people is a rather tasteless thing , i also think we can make exceptions for a few people . 
  walking warehouse of intellectual smegma ruport murdoch is one of them . 
  you really think people in lithuania are dying because they 're one practicing heart surgeon short ? 
  i mean ... really ? 
  i do n't think you understand how the logistics of modern medicine work . 
  i do n't think you understand how most things work , going by the baffling lack of rationale behind your question .

  just a passing mention of soros is not nearly enough anti-semitism , man . 
  and at least throw some ` cultural marxism ' in there too , then we 're talking !, 
  they were definitely the most positive bunch , though . 
  even cleaned up after themselves . 
  if you people ( obviously not * you * with the scottish flair ) enjoy scots , i beg your attention to this abso-fucking-lute gem : [ glasgow wind up call ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebvikewrtvc ) i 've loved this piece for years and years , ever since it was brought to my attention by a glaswegian internet-friend well over a decade ago . 
  also : [ hector brocklebank ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zrloaxen-u ) this is all without subtitles , so definitely hard-mode for non-natives .

  you guys be careful not to feed the erdotroll tho , no matter how dire the circumstances and how strong the call for a ` strong leader ' . 
  somehow this seems to me like it all plays out in erdogan 's favour . 
  situationally , i mean . 
  i 'm not suggesting gollum orchestrated this or anything , that 's way out of my tinfoil range . 
  but he might take advantage of the situation . 
  well , they killed quite a few more than 10 , but randomly targeting civilians for maximum carnage has never been their mo , no .

  we can start building a wall then . 
  the ashes of kim philby, 
  yeah , i 'm being paid straight from brussels , lad . 
  there 's no way the uk made a retarded decision that left the rest of europe and much of the world in disbelief , no no , it must be paid shills . 
  oooof course . 
  you blew our cover . 
  i 'm a gay jewish eu-shill who 's getting paid to spread nasty propaganda about the poor brits . 
  if someone genuinely believes in some kind of elitist cabal controlling the eu superstate gradually eating away ` mah precious sovereignty ' , it 's not a big leap for them to get mired in really inane conspiracy shit , the likes of which you 've pointed out . 
  in my experience , you * ca n't * reason with such people , regardless of what their ` religion ' is ; actual religion , 9/11 , lizards , moon hoax , eu elite cabals ... 
  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha , oh man , really ? 
  and geert wilders is half indonesian and married to a hungarian , but that does n't stop him from saying the twattiest things either . 
  `` i 'm not racist , i have a german wife ! '', 
  is very similar to `` i 'm not a racist , some of my best friends are black , but ... '', 
  if people mad about current immigration policy take that out on a german woman who 's been in the uk since 1973 , i think that says all we need to know about the ignorant scum that lashed out at her . 
  it 's like saying i 'm mad about the brexit , then travel to dublin to insult an irishman . 
  like wtf ? 
  seven dutchies then . 
  your colt only holds 6 rounds !, 
  oh yeah , let me just get out the `` global politician alcoholism study '' to substantially bolster my off-the-cuff remark that people in high pressure jobs are not unlikely to fall victim to some form of substance abuse . 
  crazy talk , absolute crazy talk . 
  needs four scientific studies before i can even * dream * of making such a comment . 
  mock us again and i 'll have four tall-as-fuck dutchies force you to pronounce my nickname over and over and over again until you 've got it down flawlessly . 
  in other words , you will die of thirst and exhaustion .

  hiddink 's second tenure and blind have been terrible for us , but it 's amazing to see roy `` you stupid owl cunt '' doing even worse . 
  i mean , sure , a lot of the players failed to turn up especially tonight , but hodgson 's management has been all over the place . 
  squad selection was dubious , playing people way out of position , no logic to at least half his subs , if he even subbed in time to make a difference . 
  motd panel tore into him about it as well . 
  shearer was livid . 
  cd projekt red should stop shipping their games to the uk . 
  that 'll teach them .
