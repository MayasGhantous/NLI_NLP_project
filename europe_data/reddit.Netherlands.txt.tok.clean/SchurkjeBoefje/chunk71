  and his menorah , of course . 
  * obviously * . 
  privatized judges are satan 's jerk-off lube , but they 're only a small part of the us penal system and certainly not a big reason for the state which it 's in today . 
  if you want a nice , monolithic thing to point your finger at , it 's the whole `` tough on crime '' mentality that permeated american politics from the early/mid 80s on . 
  throw the `` war on drugs '' in the mix and the us ' continuing problem with severe socio-financial inequality and there 's your problematic result . 
  if the politicians say no to the referendum 's result despite promising it will be honoured , i do n't care what the eu does , i will be getting my popcorn to watch the uk 's political landscape self-immolate . 
  lol, 
  but ... you did . 
  i love how this post is ` controversial ' :d . apparently , the brexit vote never happened !, 
  time for a ukxit . 
  `` give us our country back ! '', 
   how about swiss german ? 
  no wegli !, 
  is this the real life ? 
  or just good craic ? 
  maybe they do , maybe they do n't . 
  i do n't know , as a non-american who 's not familiar with the outlet . 
  however , if comrade reynolds * specifically * meant the nyer with `` they '' , he should 've * specified * so this mess could 've been avoided . 
  the right alt key on my keyboard is actually labeled `` alt gr '' maybe the `` gr '' symbolizes the anger of the right alt ... 
  do n't be stealin ' mah thunder now , yankee doodle pigeon !, 
  it got stabbed , but it 's not dead yet . 
  * actually * , the nsdap never gained a majority vote in german elections . 
  the way the nazis eventually came to power is very complicated , sneaky , violent and opportunistic . 
  they certainly were not simply ` voted in ' . 
  not saying there was no widespread support for the nazi party , but it certainly was n't a proper ( in our modern eyes ) , democratic election in which they gained majority of the popular vote . 
  i do n't give a fuck about the new yorker , i just think it 's funny how an american on a european sub whinges about ` them ' when ` them ' is other americans . 
   was wondering how they 'd be able to turn this into something spiteful about americans . 
   how they 'd be able to turn this into  they `` they '' in this context are actually the new yorker ( medium ) and andy borowitz ( author ) . 
  both of which are decidedly american . 
  so i 'm not sure where you 're going with your ` they have something against americans ' . 
  this is from your own corner , man . 
  because he is a trumpist who likes to complain about ` cucks ' . 
  of course this is somehow connected to an invasion of brown people in his mind . 
  whenever you see comments like his , have a gander at the person 's post history . 
  i have been reddit-sleuthing today quite a bit and i swear i 'm on at least a 70 % success rate in correctly guessing what they are from just one post . 
  the way they fit a profile is uncanny ; same mannerisms , terminoloy , hyperbolic arguments , off-topic rants , often even same subreddit preferences . 
  dont bother . 
  we will build them the shittiest nursing home that frugality can buy . 
  invest it in british pounds before you spend it !, 
  i like to joke about this to my aussie gaming buddy , but the notion that the convict-colonists were severe , violent criminals is quite a bit of a myth . 
  back in those days , murderers and rapists did n't get a forced holiday trip , they were executed . 
  many of the soon-to-be aussie convicts were thieves , pickpockets , prostitutes ... that kind of crime . 
  i do n't know what you have been smoking , but dutch fringe politician arnoud van doorn , pvv-member turned muslim , [ has never been mayor of duisburg ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/duisburg#b.c3.bcrgermeister_bis_1876 ) . 
  what the fuck are you on about ? 
  you ca n't believe it 's not butter ? 
   yes he was the mayor of duisburg , look it up yourself ... 
  i know more about the netherlands than you do . 
  you 're trolling now , right ? 
  duisburg is in germany ... 
  he was never a mayor , what are you talking about ? 
  you 're not even dutch , stop spreading bullshit you 've heard through the rumour mill, 
   for bonus points , lets have a unified federation of scotland , ireland and wales in the eu ooh . 
  the celtic federation ? 
   please down vote this it 's misinformation \\* upvotes * i 'm a right fookin ' rebel . 
  freedooooooooooom !!!!!!!!, 
   i would rather my country be poor for another 1000 years than in such a union . 
  with such a mentality , i do n't want you in the eu either . 
  history is history . 
  refusing to cooperate today because of shit hundreds of years ago is preposterous . 
  not 80 years ago there was this ` thing ' with germany that , by all rights , gives many nations the opportunity to be massively butthurt , but at some point you have to move on . 
  if in 2016 you 're whinging about the horrors of ottoman occupation centuries ago , i do n't think you 've really understood nor are on board with what modern europe is sort of supposed to be about . 
  sorry to say it like that . 
  because they were highly determined individuals backed by an established terror network . 
  they certainly were n't ` idiots ' ( as in , stupid ) who made a rash decision . 
  [ dabiq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dabiq,_syria#in_islamic_eschatology ), 
  at this point russia 's and turkey 's respective governments are just literally trying to out-retard each other ... 
  do n't apologize , that joke was ace . 
  ey now , do n't knock a good reinheitsgebot pilsner just because your fruity tripels are enjoyed by hipsters worldwide . 
   yelling kitchenmaids this glorious dutchism makes me want to shovel earth into the sea . 
  hm , quite similar to a view from [ my city ] ( http://www.noorderkrant.nl/files/2011/11/leeuwarden-gracht-achmeatoren-boten-foto-mark-van-der-meulen3.jpg ) we 're sisters now . 
  well ... saruman is very old so i can imagine he complained about drafts a lot ... 
  safer , maybe . 
  more effective ? 
  hmmm . 
  more fun ? 
  fuck no . 
  that ref has confidence issues otherwise you would n't blatantly shop your authority around like that . 
  what a wankstain . 
  i 'm not sure how ` constantly invading europe ' suddenly makes them unqualified to be in the eu . 
  because in case you 've missed a few history classes , european nations have been warring the shit out of each other for over two millennia , man . 
  we 've been effectively invading ourselves over and over and over and over again . 
  with the possible exception of africa ( all those little tribes ) and the near east , europe is probably the most warring continent on the planet . 
  we ca n't bar people from getting in on the premise of a few invasions . 
  we 've done much worse ourselves . 
   culturally they are not similar and their history of constantly invading europe proper makes them not exactly suitable candidates to have a voice in how europe is run lol, 
  that 's all irrelevant as your initial argument was : turks are n't europeans hence , it makes as much sense as russia or afghanistan ( wut ) joining the eu . 
  afghanistan absolutely would n't make sense , no , because they 're not in europe . 
  but russia * is * in europe , for it 's most important parts anyway . 
  so your line of reasoning falls through . 
  you can not categorically deny russia entry to `` europe '' because of geographical reasons like you can afghanistan or , to a somewhat lesser extent , turkey . 
  uhm ... the vast majority of russians live west of the ural and as such , geographically in europe ... 
   so impossible standards of evidence then . 
  you are spectacular . 
  first you claim cox must 've known about grooming gangs in her constituency , when asked if you have any evidence for this , you claim it 's ` impossible standards ' ? 
  [ what the actual fuck ? 
  ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/004/592/my-brain-is-full-of-fuck.jpg ), 
  if we had to erase everything connected to nasty people , there would n't even be much * human * culture left . 
  do n't bother trying to argue with him , he just copy-pasted parts of [ this ] ( http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2016/06/the-selective-compassion-of-jo-cox/ ) article . 
  the younger generations are fighting back i see , this is encouraging news . 
   not sure if the dutch have invested a lot in the manufacturing sector i have no idea for how much it counts in this context , economics is not my fort\u00e9 ( understatement of the day !,
