  but i do think that many supporters of absolute free speech tend to forget at times that it 's very much a two-way street . 
   in fact i am all for imams openly preaching what you are saying . 
  then you 're a bigger and braver man than i am . 
  i do n't want religious fuckknuckles in my country preaching about how gays should be killed or about how all non-ingroup are immoral infidels . 
  how so exactly ? 
  there have been deportations already of hate preachers . 
  but ofc , if we had true free speech , islamic hate preachers should be just as protected as anyone else ... 
  somehow i think many people getting excited by this article will not like * that * very much ... 
  so if there 's no hate speech and all speech is free speech , muslim zealots , islamists and jihadists should be perfectly protected to spout whatever inciteful hatred they want over here , right ? 
  `` kill the infidels , take their women , stone all the jews ! '' . 
  why not ? 
  \\* kicks back to watch r/europe 's collective heads explode *, 
  i do n't think any of the trio should be around weapons ... [ case in point ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kweojd-d10a/maxresdefault.jpg ), 
  i do n't think the distinction between killing them or not is a great indicator of general tolerance for homos . 
  if you do n't kill them , but throw them in life for jail or incite rape gangs to take revenge on them , you 're hardly much better . 
  i would agree that ( strict ) islamic countries are , on paper at least ( i 've heard that in some places in saudi arabia there are relatively thriving gay communities . ), 
  the worst to live in as a homosexual , but i do n't think we should pretend that many equally backwards predominantly ` christian ' nations are really that much better . 
  `` do you want to be shot in the face or burned alive ? '', 
  `` well , if i * had * to choose i guess shot in the face . 
  but ca n't i go home and finish my puzzle ? '', 
  you said uganda was an outlier . 
  it obviously is n't considering the scope of anti-lgbt legislation in africa . 
  eh , [ this page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_africa ) generally does not make for happy reading , man ... [ tl ; dr picture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_africa#/media/file:african_homosexuality_laws.svg ),

  the delta works would 've been a lot cooler . 
  or , a bit more clich\u00e9 , the recognisable canals and houses of amsterdam would 've worked well . 
  karma police they beat my ass in istanbul over just a drink and they are still on the looo-hooose oooh ooooh heeeeey hmmmm, 
  targeting elected politicians with the intent to murder because of ideological convictions ( their own and their victims ' ) sounds like terrorism to me ... 
  [ says who ?!, 
  regardless of whether he 's right or wrong , should a minister of foreign affairs be saying things like this on a personal title ? 
  i mean ... it 's not like he 's some random german who can brainfart whatever he wants . 
  the fact that alex jones has made a lot of money with his utterly stupid conspiritardism is in my eyes enough reason for any passing aliens to exterminate our piece of shit species . 
  i do n't think there is actually any consensus on breivik regarding that . 
  the only thing they agreed on was that he was n't psychotic during his attacks . 
  obviously he 's not a particularly well-balanced man and there 's plenty wrong with him , but he was n't mentally ill in the sense of ` did n't know what he was doing ' . 
  he understood what he was doing and the consequences thereof very well . 
  if you 're succesfully being soft-scared into voting one way as a people , you do n't even deserve democracy . 
  turkey was n't and is n't north korea , the turkish people had plenty of control to not let things end up like this . 
  they let things end up like this . 
  most definitely messed up , but we need to take care to not mis-label messed up extremists as actually having an established mental illness that had played a part in why they did what they did . 
  many isis adepts are also obviously messed up , with some very fucked up ideas . 
  but they 're not all mentally ill . 
  ah yes . 
  `` convenient '' . 
  the first word out of the mouths of conspirinuts worldwide . 
  i 'm sure you 're just `` thinking for yourself '' and `` asking questions '' . 
  or just a very committed extremist . 
  breivik was n't mentally ill after all either . 
  you were amongst the people who were crying conspiracy and false flag before her body was even cold , so maybe you need to pipe down with your ridiculous assertions .

  why ? 
  russia is endearing themselves to the world these days . 
  hooligans , doping ... 
  oh , i 'm not saying what he shouted ( or not ) is not relevant in the big picture , but for now all signs point in the same direction anyway , regardless of what he shouted . 
  an mp getting shot at a political rally is n't street crime , man . 
  who the fuck tries to rob the fulcrum of a gathering ? 
   is shouting `` allah hu akbar '' considered irrelevant when we 're discussing extremist muslim attacks ? 
  i think you misunderstand me a bit . 
  i would say that * whether or not * an attacker shouted `` alla who 's snackbar '' is irrelevant when the attacker shot up a book signing of a controversial political cartoonist with some muhammad funnies to his name . 
  so i 'm saying that regardless of whether he shouted `` britain first '' or not , a lot of signs are pointing to a motive that indicate it * is * tied to an anti-remain ideology regarding brexit . 
  in the sense that we do n't really `` need '' him shouting `` britain first '' to confirm our suspicious in that direction . 
  regardless of bulgaria 's limited naval capabilities , this would be their choice , their prerogative , no ? 
  they do n't need to be pressured into choosing sides imo . 
  let them be , do their bulgar thing . 
  if both sides are as concerned about security as they claim , this would be the ideal solution . 
  then again , i am naught but a sweet summer child :p, 
  i would n't be surprised either if an open or concealed carry permit came with the caveat that , to some extent , the weapon has to be a recognized product and not some home-cooked contraption . 
  if it * is * a home-cooked contraption , i imagine there 's some kind of extra examination process to verify it 's a safe firearm . 
  of course people make their own guns in the usa , but it 's not common and probably even more uncommon for them to be used in open or concealed carry , given the understandable amount of effort involved . 
  i 'd have to do some googling to find out what 's what ( kinda curious myself at this point ) . 
  regardless , we 're really ` arguing ' ( not even ) about the tiniest details here and i do n't think we really disagree on anything . 
  i think the analogy to this , if true that the uk shooter used an unconventional weapon , would be an american murdering someone in a bar or some shit with a bolt action rifle . 
  no one carries a loaded bolt action around for self-defense . 
  if you carry a handgun , open or concealed , it 's not * that * difficult to think of impromptu situations where the person uses their personal weapon . 
  but a bolt action ? 
  a homemade firearm ? 
  an antique ? 
  it 's rare for even americans to just be lugging that shit around . 
  the issue is that conspiritards are always criminally incapable of critical source selection and making a rational risk/benefit analysis . 
  well mostly because reports indicate the firearm used was fairly ` unconventional ' . 
  either home-built or some kind of antique . 
  certainly not something an american would regard as ` normal ' for open or concealed carry . 
  second because as far as i know , the uk does n't have any personal carry laws that allow for it . 
  so if you 're out and about in the uk with a loaded weapon , you probably intend to do something with it . 
  we 'll find out soon enough what 's what , but tbh it almost seems irrelevant whether he shouted `` britain first '' in regards to determining whether this was likely a politically motivated murder or not . 
  i mean , it would be an incredible coincidence that a elected politician was shot and killed during a political gathering in the run-up to a massive political event . 
  it 's possible , of course . 
  maybe the man was a jaded ex-boyfriend , who knows ? 
  but imo the smart bets right now are solidly on ` political motive ' . 
  who the hell is walking around with firearms in their bags if they do n't plan to murder someone ? 
  even more so if the weapon was some form of home-built . 
  you do n't make and carry that around if you do n't intend to use it . 
  did the just hammer that out of rock or something ? 
  one helluva labour . 
  r/conspiracy is heavily leaking , yeah . 
  the amount of gits in this thread alone suddenly thinking it 's ` suspicious ' is staggering . 
   i suspect many on the remain side are hoping she dies of her wounds , that will give them a more powerful story to use . 
  oh come the fuck on ...
