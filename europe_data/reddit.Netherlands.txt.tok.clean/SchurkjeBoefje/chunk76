  i never understood shit like this . 
  mr. mansour , as a terrorist sympathizer , can obviously not have held much love for western , godless , hedonistic , heathen denmark . 
  but now that mr. mansour is feeling the heat , this ` connection with denmark ' suddenly pops up ? 
  which connection was that then ? 
  the one that made him disseminate extremist literature , the gist of which stands completely opposite to any modern concept of denmark , its state and its people ? 
  turkey 's reputation has been a bit rocked the last few years , but this germany-acknowledges situation has really cranked the fun up to 11 , has n't it ? 
  the entire world sees how the turkish government is acting like a bunch of toddlers . 
  they are literally behaving like angry toddlers who feel unjustly treated . 
  boh , attention grabbing headlines have been around for much , much longer than the internet has . 
  people take this whinging about clickbait too far these days . 
  username and flair most definitely do * not * check out, 
  they 're under your bed too , kid . 
  better go check . 
  what will the response in italy be when he kicks the bucket ? 
  mostly shrugging or lamentations vs. celebrations ? 
  did n't rousseff just get impeached ? 
   allright , so you are basically admitting to be a troll ? 
  good to know  that you purposefully bust by balls while being an offensive teenager ( mentally or physically ) earned you your ignore as well as you being reported   take care , you may have the last word , i grant it to you  lmao , in addition to another strawman ( no , i did not admit to being a troll ) , you 're now also assuming i 'm being an offensive teenager * and * you 're throwing in a falsified report ( i did not break any rules ) to boot ? 
   its weird asking me to ignore you you suggested it . 
  i gratefully accept . 
  sometimes i respond to your stupid musings but your own replies remind me every time why i should 've left it alone . 
   so if you do i 'm just gon na have to ignore you . 
  please do . 
  you seem obsessed with shoehorning others into your preferred antagonist image . 
  the poster never says it 's ok , just that in small numbers crazies * are * relatively harmless compared to crazies in large numbers . 
  this is true . 
  you really like your strawmen , do n't you ? 
  both , and those are linked to an extent . 
  these two organizations obviously have very different standards . 
  a cursory glance of their homepages is all that 's needed to confirm this fact . 
  to equate their factual reporting with daily mail standards is utterly ludicrous imo . 
  you can dislike the guardian 's salon socialist op-ed stuff as much as you want , i know i do , but that 's only a small piece of what a newspaper does . 
  i do n't think this is even a matter of opinion . 
  if you really think the guardian is on the same low level of journalism as the daily mail , you hate the guardian so much that it 's clouding your judgement . 
  the guardian features some very cringy opinion pieces once in a while , but their standard of reporting is very high . 
  very different ballgame from actual tabloids and rags . 
   you are presenting the typical sad argument that `` a little '' fundamentalist is ok while `` a little more '' is bad . 
  straight up strawman . 
  no one says a little fundamentalism is ` ok ' , but a lot of fundamentalism is most definitely worse . 
  metal gear solid on playstation was a great game . 
  i see you are not familiar with english culture . 
  they 're okay , but they ca n't measure up to the colourful beauty of our old gulden notes .

  it still seems to me that so many ideas regarding games are from the brains of people who do n't really know much about gaming . 
  there have always been plenty of games with strong female characters , but people like to focus on the negative and the out-of-context . 
  this man literally acts like a young child , a toddler . 
  just baffling . 
   i 'm not a creationist `` if you look at the genetic code or dna of any organism , you can see that it is basically programmed to be what it is , and many scientists believe that maybe everything is not just coincidence , and there may have been a helping hand somewhere along the line . 
   '' uuuuhm ... 
  whining about ` missing links ' legitimately shows that you have n't understood the first damn thing about evolutionary theory . 
  next thing we know you 'll claim `` but if humans evolved from apes , why are there still apes ?!, 
  checkmate , atheists ! '', 
  fkn spare us already . 
  it 's obvious your knowledge of et is dismal at best , non-existent at worst . 
  just ... stop . 
  stop . 
  read a book . 
  i can see where this is going ... 
  fascinating . 
  angela merkel is statistically a dictator ? 
  why would i ? 
  you 've demonstrated yourself to be someone who makes no sense , consistently moves the goalposts when called on his bullshit and throws so many strawmen around that some eu countries would qualify you as an agricultural machine . 
  i have zero desire to interact with you . 
   and the simple fact is that people like you deny basic causation on this issue . 
  i have n't even given my own opinion on the matter , yet you profess to know it already . 
   it seems like we have moved from denying such an idea is even held to `` well it isnt held by merkel . '', 
  i 've done what i wanted . 
  [ what ? 
  i do n't even ... ] ( http://cf.mp-cdn.net/a7/08/7f15d8eff5246f52b429f1f9fa74-confused-jackie-chan.jpg )  but really the point i made , was that the media seems to be giving lots of attention to afd but not that woman ... afd says something silly and now you 're dragging up a 50 second clip of a local politician saying something stupid at least 9 months ago ? 
  dear god , you really * really * like your strawmen , do n't you ? 
  the 50 second video clip does all of that ? 
   i post video of another politician confirming his statement what exactly does merkel herself have to do with the green party politician in the video ? 
  do you even logic ? 
  the woman in the video is not merkel . 
  you are aware of this , yes ? 
  i think you are an alien that is sent to earth to liquify all humans so your spider alien overlords can drink us like milkshakes . 
  [ evidence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw-9kujpmd0 ), 
  so a clip of an individual * green party * politician is proof to you that merkel ( she is cdu , btw , not green ) is a dictator who is trying to replace the german people with immigrants . 
  how is anything you presented relevant ? 
  afd does not seem capable of rationally solving any problem calling merkel a dictator is not incidental nonsense and lmao `` face of a dying nation '' , what a channel . 
  and you spammed it four times in this thread already . 
  you 're ` one of those ' people , are n't you ? 
  imperial germany had little to do with democracy , mate . 
  conchita wurst , jane bull , wim-lex with a wig and a dress , angela merkel ... yeah i can see this work !, 
   and we all know what the latter scenario means in europe . 
  settling our scores through the medium of interpretative dance ? 
  `` and next on leaders on ice , the quarter finals with merkel vs. 
  i think erdogan just basically has like a bucket list of people he wants to piss off . 
  he 's just working through the list . 
  it still looks desolate as hell . 
  and every building is a cube or rectangle = /, 
  i 'm not necessarily rendering hindsight judgement on it , but then again im not the one waving the imperial flag anno 2016 either . 
  by doing so , one is somewhat rendering a positive judgement in hindsight on that regime . 
  a regime that may have been ` more humane ' than others ( which i find a highly debatable position but okay ) at the time , but still a regime that is not admirable today in any shape or form imo . 
  i do n't know , mate . 
  we need an actual german to answer that . 
  my guess would be that amongst the more hardcore supporters of german populist-right parties , the imperial period represents somewhat of an ideal notion of germany to them . 
  highly militarized society , ` ethnically pure ' , strong authoritarian state . 
  their unhappiness regarding corruption should scale with the relative levels of actual corruption . 
  people from wales or mississippi can not be venezuela levels of unhappy with wales levels of corruption .
