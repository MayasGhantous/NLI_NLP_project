   scotland yard said he suffered a fractured skull and blood clot on the brain holy shit . 
  that 's well past any regular ol' beatdown . 
  that 's attempted murder . 
   scotland yard on sunday said four men and two women in their 20s were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder glad sy agrees !, 
  what * is * multiculturalism then though ? 
  i mean , i can look at ( semi -- ) parallel society stuff and conclude `` multiculturalism has failed '' . 
  yet i can also look at the asian kids from the local takeaway that speak with a slight regional accent and conclude that `` multiculturalism has worked '' . 
  but if there is a weigh-up of bad vs. good then `` multiculturalism = bad '' is a very hasty conclusion . 
  i 'm not saying that something like parallel societies are n't a huge issue , because they are . 
  but a lot of people point at the failed cases and then claim that muliculturalism never works , which simply is n't true . 
  one can make two lists of successes and failures . 
  with the failures generally being more apparent because they generate negative publicity . 
  how can you speak of a unilateral ` failure of multiculturalism ' and only focus on the failed cases ? 
  but such riots have more roots than just multiculturalism . 
  it 's also a socio-economical thing ; poor people generally have very little recourse to do something against errors of the system . 
  the sun is n't fit enough to wipe your arse with . 
  hell , i would n't even let my cat shit on it . 
  its little turds deserve a more worthy surface . 
  except they 're not ? 
  people have been rioting against authorities for millennia . 
  to hard-couple that to multiculturalism is just silly . 
  the ` palingoproer ' for example had absolutely fuck-all to do with multiculturalism . 
  a few years ago there were massive riots in vancouver over a fucking hockey game , of all things . 
  but turkey is the supposed attacking party here . 
  having old as fuck tanks is more of an issue for the attacker than it is for the defender . 
  the problem that turkish armour will have in a full on conflict is that their masses of pattons are going to be buttered by slightly less outdated weapons systems .

  the google maps link you have there is right on the bridge :p you notice the gap in the pavement with the yellow/black paint and on the other end there 's a [ big ol' cut-out where the road part slides in to . 
  ] ( https://www.google.gr/maps/@48.6434099,-2.0221146,3a,75y,185.19h,69.59t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1szy02douy7sslrlo0i9mm5q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) it 's a bit of an unorthodox moving bridge , but it definitely moves . 
  catholic church is the biggest pedo organization in the world . 
  `` but muh muslims ! '', 
   for the same reason the crazy christians that do n't even like to give woman 's rights on your bible belt do n't get banned , it 's very hard to define what to ban and not devolve into state racism . 
  i think a case could be made that something like wahhabism is a political ideology for a large part as well . 
  but if an outright ban is legally troublesome , at least the spread and funding of wahhabism here should be heavily curtailed . 
   of course stop supporting countries like saudy arabia , and other that promote this ideas whould be a great step and better than trying to stop ideias with the state . 
  you can also pour money and support for those communities and for your own preachers , just do what the saudis do for fight them . 
  i think we might need the non-zealot parts of saudi leadership to combat the maniacs . 
  some of those are very well protected with concentric walls . 
   did you just basically agree that terror attacks are caused by multiculturalism ? 
  ira and eta do n't real ? 
  it depends on how people ` do ' their faith . 
  it starts with what people do in their own head . 
  that 's what faith and religion * is * . 
  you do n't have to * respect * it , but i 'm pretty sure that by now getting too upset that someone is n't from ` your ' faith is not a worthwhile thing to fight over . 
  that 's what i meant with my original comment about respecting religion as part of enlightenment values . 
  you do n't have to * like * ( other ) religion ( s ) , but fighting over them like we did for so long has caused way too much bloodshed . 
   i think you are forgetting that religion is n't practiced in ones own head . 
  except ... it is ? 
  i mean , it 's not necessarily contained to that , but it sure as hell starts with it . 
  i never said you should be welcoming to those people ? 
  in fact , i actually said earlier that we should ban the more ultra-radical and violent interpretations . 
  so can religion in eastern/south eastern europe , with all their fervent catholics and orthodox maniacs . 
  this shit is n't a one-horse race and people 's hands are n't as clean as they like them to be . 
  but islam is n't monolithic and there are plenty variations and interpretations that are n't a flagrant breach of said values . 
  a wholesale ban affects everyone . 
  it 's stupid and shortsighted . 
  nice low-effort post closed with a dumb-ass cliche . 
  read a book . 
  and yes , unless your moral system is severely lacking , it 's quite obvious there 's a significant difference . 
  jesus , ca n't believe that has to be explained . 
  in case you forgot , a spectacular amount of european blood has been shed in conflics about religion . 
  at some point we figured out that maybe it 's not worth it to get that upset about what other people do in their own heads ... 
  so is christianity with their fascination for heaven and judgement . 
  ban that too then . 
   sure , go ahead and conduct a poll .
