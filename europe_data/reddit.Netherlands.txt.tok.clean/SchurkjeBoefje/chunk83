  `` given a choice , would you rather be gassed or starved to death . '', 
  if given the premise of ** certain death ** , then gassing is arguably more humane since it 's quicker , but in a practical sense , there is still the possibility of survival under a widespread starvation/famine situation . 
  there is no possibility of survival for someone ` selected ' upon arrival at the railway station of birkenau . 
  using the current year as an indication that we know more than we did before the fall of the soviet union , and that we should pay attention to the most modern research , using the largest number of sources available , in contrast to regurgitating cold war estimates in 2017 . 
   the only thing that really bothers me about your comment is the typical issue of treating religions as something special . 
  they 're ideologies like so many other things and should be treated that way . 
  i do n't think i was doing that ? 
  at least i did n't intend to . 
   of course a person is free to believe in whatever god ( s ) they want to but that is n't religion . 
  that 's just personal belief . . or faith . 
  a religion is an institution preaching a certain ideology . 
  if they preach hate there should be no protection for them that there is n't for other hate groups like nazis or whatever . 
  hate is hate . 
  i do n't give a shit if they call themselves a religion . 
  i have little against what you just said . 
  where i dig my heels into the sand out of principle is when people try to claim that * all of islam * is a hateful ideology . 
  i can think of one or two loopholes to that question , but generally speaking , islam . 
  however , your initial point was about whether the bad outweighs the good , not which is worse . 
  i think a case could be made that we 'd be better off without christianity or even any religion . 
  being able to make a stronger case against islam does n't invalidate your original ` good vs bad outweighing ' point . 
  you 're kind of moving the goalposts imo . 
  they are definitely both monsters , you get no argument from me . 
   later seems more evil and more destructive to me . 
  well , i 'd disagree with the more evil , but that 's the kind of thing you can debate for weeks . 
  i do agree with your notion that stalinist communism was in a way more ` treacherous ' than straight up nazism . 
  technically speaking communism is supposed to be inclusive and all for one , but all too often that premise was brutally shattered by whoever was in power ( stalin , mao , pol fkn pot , etc ) . 
  i suppose one could argue that nazism was ` more honest ' about its evil . 
  same could be said for christianity imo, 
  i 'm fine with that , to an extent , as it would be applicable to all religions . 
  but you know as well as i do that the ones who scream `` ban islam '' the loudest are n't interested in applying the criteria across the board . 
  one could certainly argue so and have a steady footing , but i think that just splits the issue up in a ` moral barbarity ' part and ` practical barbarity ' part , with the point you just raised having more to do with the latter than the former . 
  no , i do not . 
  do you think british colonization was equal to the immediate , relentless , and inevitable extermination of the native population because of racial ideology that determined that ` lesser peoples ' needed to die ? 
  say all you want about the fucked up arrogance of kipling and his `` white man 's burden '' , but at least it did n't advocate straight up eradication no matter what ... 
  til, 
  obviously , from an indian subcontinent perspective , churchill ( the uk ) was clearly subjectively worse , since you had no direct contact with hitler 's special brand of insanity . 
  i think israeli dude has a point when it comes to a specific moral judgement that there 's a difference between a callous indifference and outright ` going out of your way to achieve it ' extermination . 
   everything bad that happened to germany back then was solely because of the treaty i reiterate , that 's black and white taken to the extreme . 
  i thought yazidis were some sufi branch ? 
  swastika wurst goebbels ' genuss herrenschnitzel f\u00fchrer 's favorit ( leberkn\u00f6dl ) wehrbauer omelett bolshevistischer alptraum ( egg-whites with milk and tiger-sauce , made by chef hans frank ) . 
  but `` islam '' is n't a monolithical thing . 
  what about yazidis ? 
  sufis ? 
  but the idea of ` versailles treaty caused hitler ' is a very black and white outlook that i simply can not subscribe to . 
  sure , i do n't disagree with that . 
   do we forget the events from ww1 to ww2 and what actually gave force to hitler to rise ? 
   do we forget who among other was the one behind the plan to fuck up germany during that time as a punishment that practicly gave rise to hitler ? 
  there 's an interesting point about the versailles treaty that suggests it either was n't harsh enough or there should n't have been reparations at all . 
  as far as `` fuck up germany '' goes , versailles was n't nearly as harsh as the treaty of brest-litovsk that was imposed upon russia just a year earlier by the germans . 
  for the spirit of the time , the terms of the versailles treaty were far from outlandishly harsh , and germany should n't have had much issue paying for it . 
  the worldwide economic crisis threw a spanner in the works , for sure , but everyone was affected by that . 
  not to mention that , if i recall correctly , significant parts of the versailles debt was wiped , and the german economy was recovering by the time the nazis actually managed to seize power . 
   his decisions to solely blame germany for ww1 ( while in fact even britain back then had a massive share on that clusterfuck ) and made them pay for literally everything while in the process taking away their colonies and everything they could possibly have to begin any sort of production led to germany being bankrupt thus creating the perfect road for hitler . . and yet none of that explains or rationalizes , let alone excuses , hitler and the nazis ' rabid hatred of `` judeo-bolshevism '' ( kommissar order says hi ) and the ideology of them being the herrenvolk needing lebensraum in the east , ` drang nach osten ' , the actual policy for the conquered eastern parts * outlined in generalplan ost , their decision to annihilate * all * european jews starting late ' 41/early ' 42 . 
  so ... no . 
  just no . 
  when it comes to responsibility for the horrific death toll , it 's not a question of an evenly divided blame-pie . 
  nazi-germany eats most of the pie there . 
  \\* word error edit, 
  just forbid any mosques with imams not trained and audited by the state . 
  simpler . 
  sure , i can ship that . 
   or just forbid mosques . 
  lol no . 
  i have zero love for islam but straight up banning entire world religions is a flagrant breach of the enlightenment values we 're supposed to appreciate . 
  i 've noticed a significant shift away from ` careful not to step on any toes ' in central leftist circles the past 10 years . 
  at some point you got ta call bullshit as bullshit and strict islamic parallel societies are bullshit that needs to be stopped . 
  can the lack of true famines be contributed to a system of subsistence farming without hardcore central oversight ? 
  in that case , you 'll be happy to know that the nazis also starved plenty of people . 
  i think there is also the aspect that in mid 20th century europe , in a well developed and civilized country such as germany , this sort of barbarism was industrialized and bureaucratized . 
  there 's an aspect of ` should n't we have known better by now to not descend into these levels of barbarity ? ', 
  within the very complicated moral debate about who was the ` worst ' , i would make the case that hitler was the actual worst , but it 's a very difficult topic that three dozen highly distinguished academics could have for thirty years and reach no consensus . 
  yet , none of that of course suggests that stalin was n't a paranoid mass-murdering villainous maniacal monstrous sociopath . 
  because he definitely was . 
  remember , for someone who would regard hitler as # 1 sicko , being ` not as bad as hitler , but not by much ' is n't exactly much of an achievement . 
  the marianas trench is over 11km deep . 
  that does n't make a 9.5 km trench a kiddy pool . 
  it 's still deep sea terror . 
   it says that in all of stalins time he was responsible for the death of 6,000,000 this is far more than the 4 mil that died in the famines churchill was responsible , so the claim you said was false was actually true i was assuming that the original comment referenced to hitler and not stalin . 
  whilst an assumption , in the general context of such debates i thought it was a relatively safe one to make , and i 'll stand by it unless op corrects me on it . 
   although i 'm sorry for calling you a communist apologist , most of them do n't even admit that stalin did shit apology accepted . 
  and yeah , hardcore tankies suck , they are fucking morons . 
   i say this as someone who generally leans to the left : the way the left apologizes for terror and stonewalls any attempt to fix the root causes of it is beyond vile . 
   like , i seriously do n't understand . 
  these ideologies are anathema to what most of the left believes in , but they routinely stop any attempts to block islamic extremism in the name of `` standing up to islamophobia '' . 
  it 's horrendous and so incredibly frustrating to watch . 
  why do they insist on defending the indefensible ? 
  see , now we 're getting very close to the * actual * definition of the `` regressive left '' , a term happily thrown about by hard right-wingers and reactionaries in many context where it completely misses the mark , but quite accurate for what you just described . 
  it 's exactly what people like maajid nawaz , an actual muslim and ex-radical , are fighting against ; it 's his definition after all , he came up with it for people on the ( far ` ish ) left tolerating islamic intolerance towards a/b/c / x/y/z out of some notion of cultural protectionism or authenticity . 
  like ` we ' , as westerners , are n't ` allowed ' to make radical muslims adjust to the values of western society , which is of course severely patronizing as nawaz eagerly points out , and even more importantly it 's very damaging to many muslims in the west who do n't identify with strict islamic values , yet live in closed and sometimes fully parallel islamic mini-societies . 
  i hate seeing that kind of apologism as well . 
  they 're like the real thing that far-righters like to caricaturize so broadly . 
  which annoyingly enough is n't based on thin air . 
  c'mon now , that 's not even an argument ... i ask you one more time , what 's your point here ? 
  are there any other factors that rival the magnitude of nazi desire to colonize the east in the name of ultra-violent ethno-centralism ? 
  have you even ever heard of a thing called generalplan ost and what they intended to do ? 
  a very broad wiki page ... okay ? 
  what 's your point here ? 
  quote me where i say that `` stalin was n't that bad '' and i will wire transfer you a million euros . 
  i do n't understand what 's with you people who assume that mentioning that stalin , in fact , did * not * kill ** more ** than hitler and his nazis is equal to saying `` eeh he hardly did anything wrong '' . 
  like , that 's the last fucking thing that 's being implied here .
