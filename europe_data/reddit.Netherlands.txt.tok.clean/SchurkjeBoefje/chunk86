  i think it was the drug use . 
  glad you sobered up , though !, 
  ya still family . 
  we have to appeal to the french . 
  maar mn originele comment was meer om de uitspraak van `` dude , where 's my car ? '', 
  why do you have a yellow star ? 
  you 're a savage , per . 
  so ... you want ` third worlders ' to stay ` third worlders ' ? 
  and what or who determines what is a ` third worlder ' ? 
  it 's a rewarding enterprise . 
  ofc not , they ( wilders ) do n't have any actual solutions . 
  it 's all big words and bluff and puffing up , but it 's all hot air . 
  he 's like a canary in the coalmine . 
  you need to pay attention to whether he chirps or not , but you do n't look to the bird for actual advice . 
  explaining your position as being fearful of failed integration as opposed to anti ` mass ' - immigration comes across as a lot less provocative , for what it 's worth . 
  the cda is the aggregate of most mainstream christian political parties , formed somewhere in the ... oh gosh , 70s i think ( 1980 , i just checked ) . 
  stands for christen democratisch app\u00e9l . 
  a lot of smaller christian parties rolled in one . 
  in practice , they 're fairly mainstream conservative , but not * very * . 
  socially more conservative than vvd , economically perhaps a bit more ` left ' than vvd , as even as a staunch atheist i have to admit that cda and cu ( christen unie , a smaller , bit more religion oriented party ) generally take the whole `` be kind to the less fortunate '' thing a bit more seriously than a lot of other christian parties worldwide . 
  so they 're not opposed to the social welfare state in principle . 
  it 's a fascinating language no doubt , but it 's so ` in its own group ' that for pretty much all non-speakers it really does look like gibberish . 
  granted , it 's not as bad as welsh and their phobia of vowels , but still !, 
  ... :( we eat great pussy though ? 
  i linked the pic to my american friend and that was his legit reply . 
  we 're making innocent jokes about it . 
  big whoop . 
  stow the self-victimization . 
  it 's unbecoming . 
  after all that happen ... mebbe we can into sangria and liberal homosex together ? 
  this triggers me more than i expected ... 
  execute order 124 !,

  it 's not about size , it 's how you use it !!,

  congratulations , you are now a trained eu negotiator . 
  germany = the original 8th province, 
  polderen prevents polarisation, 
  we do n't have a very specific direct translation of that , but i 'll settle for : `` in je vreet , koekwaus '' as far as translating the * sentiment * of `` ha , get fucked '' , potverdorie 's response `` lekker voor je '' is probably the best appromixation , though linguistically it 's a lot cleaner ( it means `` nice for you '' but very sarcastically ), 
  you 're arousing my swamp , you teuton hunk . 
  `` at 9:30 pm local time , turkish president erdogan called the r/europe moderators ' a gang of nazis ' and spent most of the 15 minute press conference elaborating on their ` endless depravity ' and ` relentless fascism ' . 
  the r/europe moderators were not available for a response . '', 
  it probably gets neatly recycled .

  vertical columns are parties . 
  the entries in each vertical column are the candidates for said party . 
  the gaps in the 2nd and 4th column are because those are continuations of the previous party . 
  it 's not as complicated as it looks .

  just stay away from mace windus and you should be fine . 
  god no , the ballot paper is horribly unsuited for that .

  stream is offline and it says : `` ohjelma ei ole en\u00e4\u00e4 katsottavissa '' plz tell me that does n't mean the little bugger died, 
  i think there 's a pretty big gap between plucking the wing off a bee and the old trick with the ants and a magnifying glass , and a group of young kids kicking a flamingo to death in a zoo , in public , in broad daylight . 
  linked this to a murican friend . 
  his reply was : `` sheeeeeeet '' they ca n't handle, 
  this is putin level of pettiness . 
  shitbirds of a feather meme together . 
  rotherham was both a tragedy and a travesty , but it 's the attached implication that only muslims do that shit that rubs me the wrong way . 
  the people responsible for the rotherham crimes should proverbially be buried beneath the prison and the people responsible for the lack of investigation should never ever hold public office again ( at the very least ) , but let 's not forget about rolf harris , gary glitter , jimmy fucking savile , the new english football club scandal , and last but not least the bloody catholic church . 
  our own european corner is very , very dirty in this regard as well . 
  and the hypocritical outrage is what gets me . 
  if this was a new muslim pedo scandal , the whole populist right would explode in horror , but with the catholics people just kinda shrug and go `` aw shucks , those catholic rascals again '' . 
  fn members peddling in holocaust denial ? 
  nooooooo !,

  if that large chunk doesnt want to be painted with the racist brush , maybe they shouldnt support racists then ? 
  crazy thought , i know , but if widespread racism isnt a dealbreaker fot someone , that might reflect poorly on them . 
  imagine the outrage if the perps were muslim ... `` barbaric religion '' , `` muhammad the pedo '' , `` will never integrate '' , `` protect our children '' , `` downfall of europe '' , `` never forget rotherham '' , `` swedish grenade rape gangs '' ... 
  meanwhile , over at the catholic church ... 
  turkey escalated this , not the dutch gov ` t. 
  they 're straight up theocrats . 
  polder taliban . 
  the sgp has its roots in the early 20th century reforming of the christian political landscape over here . 
  sgp became their own thing when a group of people did n't want to give up one of the principles of the ` nederlandse geloofsbelijdenis ' ( [ belgic confession of 1561 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgic_confession ) ) when many others were fine with modernizing a little bit . 
  in essence , the sgp was *** too radical *** for the dedicated christian political landscape of *** 1918 *** . 
  that 'll tell you all you need to know about these people , methinks . 
  turkey had 16 large surface combatants compared to our 6 . 
  nearly twice the tonnage . 
  with all 22 ships over 5 ship classes having very similar range around the 7000/8000km mark . 
  turkey has a decent navy . 
  larger than ours on a quantity basis , that 's for sure . 
  it 's rich ragout ( traditionally made with beef ) in a crunchy crust . 
  served hot , preferably with a bitter . 
  there is nothing not to love . 
  as far as i 've been able to find out , that 's exactly how they originated . 
  leftover stew rolled into some batter and fried in oil , served by taverns and drinkhouses to placate their drunk guests , who 'd otherwise go home to eat , with a warm snack . 
  earliest mentions go back to the 17th century at least , i believe, 
   i 'm not sure i mentioned the nuremberg trials at all , but hey , whatever strawman makes you sleep well at night . 
  you 're bringing up prosecuting people from ww2 within a war crime context , how are the n\u00fcrnberg trials not related to that ? 
  that 's not a strawman . 
   anyone tried for the tens of millions who starved in the ukraine under stalin ? 
  wut are you trying to claim the holodomor had `` tens of millions '' of casualties ? 
  where do you * get * this stuff ? 
  seriously . 
   but i feel the damage has already been done , since vvd ( rightwing , conservative , liberal ) and cda ( centre-right , conservative , christian-democrat ) have been pandering a lot to pvv voters lately . 
  they kind of * have * to do that to take the wind out of the pvv 's sails though .
