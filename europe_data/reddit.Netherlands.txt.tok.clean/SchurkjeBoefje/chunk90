  trying to decide who is suffering more and therefore gets to have the biggest word in how the perp should be treated is , excuse my language here , *** fucking moronic to the highest degree *** . 
  esp if other dude is trying to put all the victims ' families on his own side with bullshit speculation , just to validate his own violent revenge boner . 
  i do n't think * that * is hard to understand either ... 
  this makes sense . 
  i know , but i 've seen plenty of breivik apologism on subs that have been taken over by the far-right . 
  you really have no fucking idea what you are talking about . 
  a survivor does n't count ? 
  read what you 're writing and reflect on the stupidity of your own words for a second , please ... 
  but the `` no trump '' sign is the best part about this banner ? 
   bjorn ihler , a survivor of the shootings , said it had been right to review breivik 's treatment in jail . 
  `` what differentiates us from violent extremists is that we recognise the humanity of every human being , '' he told reuters . 
   i would say that if the families of the victims had their revenge on breivik what if the families want breivik to be judged and punished according to the norwegian justice system , instead of a lynching ? 
  have you ever spent as much as a night in the drunk tank ? 
   we can kill him and at least bring peace to families and friends of his victims . 
  it 's amazing how few survivors and victims actually think like this . 
  it 's outsiders that think this brings people peace . 
  hardly . 
  t_d and all its sister subs would easily have the same outlook . 
  i 'm certainly not an expert either but surely with things such as this the mold has to work from outside to inside . 
  christopher lee stabbed a man in ww2 , fighting against the nazis . 
  what did your man john wayne do as far as real shit goes ? 
  [ ah right ] ( http://staging.snopes.com/app/uploads/2015/05/waynequote.jpg ) , condoning genocide . 
  the immigrant trumplets and their complaints and their t_d talking points are * extremely * repetitive ... 
   edit : downvoted already ? 
  sheesh , way to prove me wrong for saying this sub is too partisan you 're on 35 pts meanwhile my simple question that you 've neglected to answer is ` controversial ' . 
  it 's amazing how many people manage to sail around the entire globe a lot without ever getting kidnapped by maniacal militants though ... let alone twice . 
  was the bacon guy reportedly mentally ill as well ? 
  isis would even claim responsibility if tomorrow we unearth a document that states charles martel stubbed his toe on his bed frame on the eve of the battle of tours . 
  omg xd time for google oh yeah , [ here ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/british-isis-member-complains-of-rude-arabs-who-steal-his-shoes-eat-like-children-and-wont-queue-10503356.html ) it is . 
   attacking arab 's administration skills , he said : `` there is no queue in any of their offices . 
   `` you could be waiting in line for half an hour and then another arab would come and push in the queue and go straight in . ''  under the heading of `` etiquettes when eating '' , he writes : `` our arab brothers , or syrians to be more precise , lack ... basic manners '' . 
   when serving food to his fellow terrorists , he said he `` was pounced upon by everyone in the room '' . 
   `` i therefore refused to give anyone food until every single one of them was sitting down in their seats , '' he added . 
   `` unfortunately i had to treat them like primary school students '' . 
   other bizarre habits detailed by mr hussain include `` stealing shoes '' . 
  the jihadi organisations are fishing in a lot of pools and converting criminals is definitely a big one . 
  islamization of radicalization is a concise way to put it . 
  a german gaming buddy of mine researches this stuff for his phd and i 've heard him talk about it as well . 
  that guy needs either serious mental help and/or jail time , but in any case should be on a very , very short leash . 
  once more with these food comparison threads , i 'm afraid i will have to eat both entries to get a good idea , 
  can we really say an island is ` cute ' if it has turned cheese into a wmd ? 
  what 's the best kind of beer ? 
  *** free beer !!!, 
  both are delicious though . 
  i love schnitzel with huntsman 's sauce !, 
  to avoid ruining the crunch of the schnitzel 's exterior , just have the sauce in a separate little bowl and then dip a piece of the meat in it before you shovel it down your piehole . 
  i love to have mine with some nice broccoli i also love cordon-blue and both pork and veal schnitzels . 
  tl ; dr : i really love schnitzels . 
  give me all your schnitzels . 
  is old swedish saying `` respect the b\u00f6rk '', 
  this plus their nt kits makes croatia the coolest country now . 
  `` turbo-autist '' . 
  i like that . 
  probably more so because of my love for forced induction than my love for autism , but regardless ... my rules ? 
  again , i 'm not the one who dragged holocaust survivors into this , but if you wan na hear what a bunch of them have to say ... http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/holocaust-survivors-donald-trump-immigration-ban-not-put-america-first-syria-refugees-fear-a7549286.html https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-the-age-of-trump-grim-warnings-from-holocaust-survivors/2016/01/27/c65ea38c-c549-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce_story.html?utm_term=.3c781714b1b6 http://www.chicagotribune.com/g00/news/chicagoinc/ct-holocaust-survivors-diss-trump-0203-chicago-inc-20170202-story.html?i10c.referrer=https%3a%2f%2fwww.google.nl%2f http://wgntv.com/2017/02/02/local-holocaust-survivors-speak-out-against-trump-immigration-ban/ http://abc7chicago.com/news/holocaust-survivors-fear-for-refugees-affected-by-trump-ban/1734512/ http://jewishjournal.com/news/nation/212949/ http://www.thewrap.com/holocaust-survivor-father-feels-president-trump/, 
  smells like organized crime hit . 
  i mean , if you 're a convinced islamic terrorist , you 're not going to chuck your grenade into a single house , are you ? 
  you 'd choose a better target . 
  unless you 're world 's shittiest terrorist . 
  though that honour might go to the glasgow guy who sent himself on fire then got kicked in the nuts so hard the kicking lad injured his leg . 
  fried mussels especially are amazing drunk food and now i 'm hungry for them . 
  i can understand it if people do n't like them , but surely you ca n't claim that no civilized cuisine could eat invertebrates when your own people are quite keen on them ? 
  i 'm certain that turkish cooks know their way around a good octopus or squid or scallop as well ... 
  i remember that the vogelaar wijken were derided back then , did the policy end up being helpful ? 
   dutch food is not much different from british food imo . 
  i think we share a food culture centered around simple but hearty ` peasant foods ' , the latter not meant condescendingly . 
  upwillem just for vla alone . 
  it 's shocking how un-widely known the joys of vla are . 
  straciatella vla , 
  you turks have a huge amount of coastline . 
  you 're not telling me you lot do n't know your good seafood . 
  or are you one of those interior turks who looks down upon the bounty of the sea and would lose their stomach after 30 minutes on one of the sultan 's galleys ? 
  the similarities are striking indeed . 
  the sound of a triggered trumplet . 
  your guy is a global embarrassment . 
  deal with it . 
  oh , so now it * does * matter what they think again ? 
  lol , you could n't be a more stereotypcal trumplet if you tried . 
  i 'm not the one who dragged holocaust survivors into this , cowboy ... 
  in my defence , that 's humble-tumble 's own flair that says that :d, 
  aaaaah , there it is , there 's the false equivalency i was waiting for . 
  you do not disappoint . 
  took you a long fucking time tho . 
  the irony that all those subs are straight up * responses * to the shit that t_d was and still is doing must completely go over your head . 
  and even then , as much as we try at ets , we ca n't achieve the levels of cultist retardation that t_d manages . 
  at least i do n't deny supporting what the subs that i post in stand for . 
  unlike someone else in this ` discussion ' ... 
  apart its old latin name of `` black mountain '' , that they come from the old yugo block , and that they speak a cyrillic language ... fuck all tbh . 
  like , that 's it . 
  actual holocaust survivors have compared trump to hitler already . 
  stop being ` concerned ' . 
  go cry back at the_donald . 
  besides , `` oranienf\u00fchrer '' just means `` orange leader '' in german . 
  you are on r/europe . 
  german is a european language . 
  it 's the core point of my argument . 
  what i love is how you indignantly claim i 'm ignoring the rest of your comment when you seem to be very consciously deflecting from my main point . 
   that 's fair when referring to t_d , but you were referring to what i was saying when you said it . 
  like i said , i was cherrypicking when i called the metaphor stretched , not sure why the majority of your reply is about that part . 
  i explained this before already .
