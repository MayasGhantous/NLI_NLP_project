  you participate in t_d . 
  lay with dogs , get up with fleas . 
  you got generalized . 
  deal with it . 
   i agree , and i 've seen it happen , but ( generally speaking , of course ) trump is about state 's rights and freedom , for better or worse , and his subreddit is similar as a result . 
  you say you agree so i ca n't even have that much to go against that part of your comment , but the second part of that sentence did made me lol . 
  so i ignored two parts of your comment , one of which i actually replied to already earlier , the other being a 50/50 of you seemingly agreeing and me not wanting to open up another , unaffiliated can of worms . 
  that 's it . 
  as far as i can see there 's no other part of your comment that holds some important argument that i 'm ignoring . 
  we went over all of it already . 
  but in this indignant show of `` you 're ignoring my ( somewhat irrelevant ) points !, 
  '' , you 've managed to again deflect from my main argument that you associate with t_d , defend t_d , and most importantly , repeat t_d talking points , which ultimately makes me treat you like , surprise , a t_d'er . 
  because you * are * acting just like a t_d'er . 
  hilariously enough , in this show you 're making trying to present yourself as different , you 're doing a great fucking job of re-affirming my stereotypes about t_d'ers and trump supporters . 
   i do n't . 
  but you do !, 
  you actively post on t_d !!!, 
  lay with dogs . 
  get up with fleas . 
   here i am !, 
  well , apparently not . 
  i claim you associate with t_d , which i think is a cult , then you say `` no , i do n't '' despite actively being a t_d member and engaging in other spats of trump apologism on reddit , and , perhaps the biggest one in this category , *** you repeat their talking points *** i mean ... wtf ? 
  toasted ryebread with garlic ? 
  i can ship that . 
  lil ' eesti did no wrong by me with this . 
  racist !, 
  dae white breadicide ? 
  the youtube comments are , as expected , absolute oculary cancer . 
  `` you mean that problem neighbourhood is more or less just a problem neighbourhood and not a sharia-controlled hell hole in a constant state of war ? 
  cover up !, 
  must be a cover up ! '', 
  fwiw , i do n't see any argument or statistic in favour of your inane statement that started this either . 
  the vast majority of american wealth is in the hands of a small amount of people . 
  for a small amount of americans , moving to europe would be a step down to a poorer country . 
  for a lot of americans , moving to europe would n't really make much of a difference . 
  less disposable income , but also less expenses when it comes to healthcare , education , etc. 
  for the other lot of americans , moving to europe would be a step up since their disposable income probably would n't change too much , but their expenses would go down significantly . 
  again , healthcare , education . 
  or it would perhaps even offer these things to americans that were unable to get them in the first place . 
  comprehensive healthcare , tertiary education . 
  how many americans live in destitute poverty , hm ? 
   it 's difficult to grasp because , as i 've said already , a trait of one member of a group is n't necessarily a trait of every member . 
  granted , it 's logical to assume that some traits are shared , as groups usually have things in common , but people are unique and should be treated as such . 
  i have had zero , zero , t_d'ers respect the rules of rational and reasonable debate . 
  and odin knows i tried . 
  so yeah , when t_d'er # 448 shows up , i 'm not going to try anymore . 
  i 'm going to generalize and assume the worst , because that 's exactly how their members ' actions have conditioned me . 
   same as above : / your metaphor was quite stretched , btw , but that 's tangential . 
  no , it 's not stretched or tangential . 
  just like t_d'ers , the groups i brought up have no capacity , fucking zero , to acknowledge a point against them . 
  it neatly follows the line of `` that 's not true '' to `` that 's not a good source '' to `` it did n't matter anyway '' to deflection and ignoring . 
  on the other end of the spectrum , they consistently make mountains out of molehills , again incapable of admitting something is insignificant even though it would n't even fucking matter for the ( often shitty ) point they 're trying to argue . 
  t_d : `` clinton is a slave to saudi-arabia because bribes ! '', 
  me : `` but the only evidence we have of financial transactions is donations to the clinton foundation , which then went to africa to fight aids '' t_d : `` clinton foundation a slush fund ! '', 
  me : `` but it 's been reviewed by two credible charity watchdogs and it received top marks ? '', 
  t_d : `` they 've been paid off ! '', 
  me : `` that 's a rather ridiculous assertion to make , do you have any proof ? '', 
  t_d : \\* links wordpress blog * me : `` your source is a blog without sources ?? '', 
  t_d : `` that 's exactly what a shill cuck for soros would say ! '', 
  one ca n't agree with t_d on what constitutes a valid source anymore . 
  they call everything fake news these days . 
  bbc dropped the ball 7 years ago and printed an incorrect fact ? 
  fake news , bcc is never to be trusted again !, 
  everything they say is a lie !, 
  one ** can not ** * reason * with these people . 
  it 's * exactly * like debating a young earth creationist , hearing them make a ridiculous and utterly misunderstood assertion about evolution , disprove them with 10 seconds of googling , only to be told that the real truth is to be found on `` whyevolutionisnonsense.wordpress.net '' . 
   anyway , i associate myself with / r/the _ donald not because they 're conservative , but because they 're libertarian . 
  best joke i 've heard all day . 
  they will defend whatever it is trump did . 
  if trump enacts aca on steroids tomorrow , t_d will be ecstatic . 
  if trump fully repeals the aca with no replacement tomorrow , t_d will be ecstatic . 
  they will , and have , defended completely opposite viewpoints just because their guy is involved . 
  it 's a cult . 
  if you do n't want to be associated with a cult , then do n't associate with a cult . 
  it really is that simple . 
   `` i could win if i tried '' is the argument i remember most back from kindergarten ...  i 've been spat in the face too many times by t_d'ers to trust them anymore . 
  you 're a t_d'er . 
  hence i 'm not going to try anymore . 
  how is this concept so difficult to grasp ? 
   what have i done that 's dishonest ? 
  what have i said that 's conspiratorial ? 
  where the actual fuck did you get anti-vaxxing or creationism from ? 
  i 've never heard of a creationist atheist . 
  good job misreading that . 
  i said they conduct themselves as , not that they are all that at the same time . 
  arguing with t_d'ers about things such as ... well , anything really , is like arguing with ye creationists about evolution or geology , or like arguing 9/11 with hardcore 9/11 truthers , or vaccines with jenny mccarthy . 
   again , you 're using `` i could win if i tried '' , which simultaneously implies that you 're losing this argument and that you do n't care about the future of america . 
  at what point did i lie or lack reason ? 
  you claim to be a liberal , yet you rub shoulders with and happily participate in t_d which is on the level of maniacal apologism for their egregiously incompetent candidate backed by a hard-right gop platform , whilst at the same time engaging in trump and t_d apologism wherever else you are on reddit . 
  you can * say * you 're a liberal a 100 times , but your actions tell me otherwise . 
  have you ever heard of this proverb : [ *** you lay with the dogs , you get up with fleas *** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:if_you_lie_down_with_dogs,_you_get_up_with_fleas )  the quote has a large almost universally agreed meaning of `` you should be cautious of the company you keep . 
  associating with those of low reputation may not only lower your own but also lead you astray by the faulty assumptions , premises and data of the unscrupulous . '', 
  you have fleas now . 
  deal with it . 
  i can easily attack all the dumb shit you say , but i wo n't because i learned my lesson before . 
  t_d'ers can not be reasoned with . 
  they do not engage in honest debate , but rather conduct themselves as conspiracy thinkers , young earth creationists , or anti-vaxxers . 
  i 've been burned way too many times by your ilk . 
  why should i attempt again ? 
  there 's no point .
