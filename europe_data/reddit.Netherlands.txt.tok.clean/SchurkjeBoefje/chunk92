  i ca n't reason people out of a position they did not reason themselves into . 
  so i wo n't try anymore . 
  what 's the point ? 
  especially with liars such as you . 
   you just want to bully people and feel special . 
  you post in t_d and you rub shoulders with all the trump supporters , how the * fuck * can you make a statement like that with a straight face ? 
  your friends are the bullies , you muppet . 
  that 's why they 're so hated . 
  go take your concern trolling somewhere else , you liar . 
  i 'm done with you . 
   it 's telling that you responded with a shitty meme instead of an actual rebuttal it 's a good thing for you trumplets that intense hypocrisy does n't actually make your heads explode . 
  \\* sort by controversial * gosh , that was easy . 
  now back to the_oranienf\u00fchrer with you . 
  europe and a lot of the far east was in fucking ruins after ww2 . 
  just because shit was rebuilt does n't mean they * profited * . 
  [ tfw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztvmib1t4t4 ), 
   do you support the cover-up of immigrant crime in germany , france , and sweden ? 
  lmao , you are such a perfect stereotype . 
  this is exactly the narrative that all the far-right subs are perpetuating and you 're eating it up . 
  you 're either like 14 yrs old or you 're just another far-righter pretending to be a neutral . 
  good !, 
  such speeds in a city centre are so far down the pit of shocking irresponsibility you might as well shoot a mortar at a random location and then claim you were n't trying to kill anyone . 
   `` as of today it 's clear that anyone who runs a number of red lights at a speed vastly exceeding the legal limit is accepting the death of other people and using his vehicle as a deadly weapon , '' german police union president oliver malchow said in a statement . 
  `` that makes the ` raser ' into a murderer . '', 
  could n't have said it better . 
  many of his comments are rated ` controversial ' which means they 're also plenty upvoted . 
  but keep on keepin ' on with the apologism !, 
  arse ring of fire after too many trappists ... 
  pointing out things you say and places you frequent to establish a character profile is not an ad hominem . 
   cite evidence of racists and nazis in the staff of either sub . 
  sure , it 's easy . 
  https://www.reddit.com/user/ramblinrambo3 there 's your / r/uncensorednews boy .

  enough for ya ? 
  t_d is n't a normal group of people to have political differences of opinion with . 
  they are hypocritical liars and rabid racists who represent the absolute fucking worst of trump 's support . 
  if you do n't want to be associated with them , then do n't associate with them . 
  it really is that simple . 
  you also participate in / r/uncensorednews , which has been taken over by far-right trump supporters and , at some point , maybe still , had a literal neo-nazi as head-mod and founder . 
  you associate with these people , in those subs . 
  and you 're not challenging them on their views either , you 're just joining in the circlejerk , affirming their beliefs , agreeing along . 
  you participate in t_d . 
  that 's enough . 
  i do n't even believe you when you say you voted stein , but tbh it makes little difference considering the big picture . 
  you essentially voted for trump and you like to rub shoulders with trump supporters whilst happily peddling the false equivalency that all sides are the same or that somehow trump was the least corrupt ( !!! ) . 
  i mean ... i do n't even ... 
  i 'm not going to bother . 
  edit : actually , come to think of it , you claiming to like stein yet rubbing shoulders with all the maniacs in t_d makes you * more * like the actual regressive left than what your t_d buddies * think * the regressive left is . 
  that 's probably the most famous one . 
   i do n't even particularly like trump , it 's just that every other politician is so demonstrably corrupt . 
  \\* dies laughing * you 're in a cult . 
  you 're in a cult that spent more than 12 months throwing buckets of diarrhea into the well , and now you are complaining that the water tastes like shit . 
   do you want unity in politics or do you just want it to be two sides mocking each other forever ? 
  that 's fucking hilarious coming from a t_d poster . 
  that ship has sailed and it was your side who torpedoed it one mile past the harbour entrance buoy . 
  you 're a t_d'er , you do n't ` get ' to appeal to unity in politics . 
   while stampot is non-appetizing dredge . 
  your passport has been revoked and you will be soon deported . 
  i dunno , man ... lot of mussels ... lot of fries ... thick , hearty sauces ... plenty of beer ... 
  i 've never been hungry after a mussel feast !, 
  sleepy , yes . 
  hungry , no . 
  what ? 
  no shareblue/ctr/shilling / ( ( ( soros ) ) ) hysteria for once ? 
  how disappointing . 
   imagine is the us did this to any other world leader . 
  have you not been paying attention ? 
  that guy has not been paying attention . 
  but that figures , he 's a t_d cultist after all . 
  triggered trumplet . 
  itt : many triggered trumplet snowflakes , far-right populists , and other shades of deplorable hypocrites . 
  i 'm pretty sure i wrote alt-reich . 
  i mean , you post a lot in ` fuckthealtright ' complaining about sjw and defending the alt-right , so ... i mean ... quack like duck ... walk like duck ... swim like duck ? 
  well this would be from shortly after italy entered the war , so 1915 but no earlier than may . 
  it shows a relatively early war situation from a relatively neutral source . 
  compared to similar prints from actively warring parties , it is quite neutral . 
  the european countries are obviously rendered as caricatures/stereotypes in the state of how they were ` doing ' at this point in the war . 
  france and germany are obviously going fully at each other . 
  they do n't even seem to have weapons , it 's a brutal brawl . 
  one of germany 's fist obscures half of poor belgium , depicting the german invasion and subsequent treatment of little neutral belgium . 
  netherlands was ofc neutral , so we 're there , smoking our pipe , looking a bit worried at what 's going on around us , though we are specifically looking at germany . 
  denmark is in much of a same situation , looking at germany with displeasure . 
  i have no idea what 's up with the weird hat , let alone the fucking cape ( ! ) . 
  sweden and norway are lovely ladies watching the spectacle from their comfortable position up north . 
  not sure why they are depicted as ladies . 
  dude in the middle on his back , looking all kinds of uncomfortable , is austria-hungary . 
  as a state , they were already having all kinds of internal problems , and now they are besieged on multiple front . 
  russia 's huge boot is squeezing its head , italy is tugging on ah 's foot , and the balkans seemed to have pulled off ah 's other boot , and may or not may be shoving things up ah 's ass . 
  this symbolizes italy and balkan nations taking territory from ah ( trieste and bosnia-herzegovina if im reading the little letters right ) big man russia , still tsarist at this point ofc , seems to be throwing its bulk at its enemies germany and austria-hungary , but despite his size , a lot of russia is literally out of the picture . 
  i 'm not sure but i think this signifies the internal problems the tsarist regime had , eventually culminating in the soviet revolution of 1917 . 
  england seems to be rather gleefully joining in the western front fray . 
  why he is a drawn as a highlander soldier , i have no idea . 
  i 'm thinking now of maybe any specific scottish influences in the british government or military at the time but i 'm coming up with nothing . 
  maybe there is none , sometimes the artists just draw something in a certain way because they like it . 
  the ottoman empire seems to have cut off its own head . 
  that 's an interesting strategy . 
  this is a reference to , you may have guessed at this point , severe internal struggles . 
  mismanagement of the empire and the crimean war essentially left the ottomans broke af and under significant influence of european banks . 
  his scimitar says `` made in germany '' . 
  little switzerland is squeezed in the middle , obviously uninvolved , but well fortified and ready with his rifle .
