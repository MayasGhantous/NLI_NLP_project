  i 'm not quite sure what romania and bulgaria are doing . 
  someone will fill it in for us . 
  italy looks like buffalo bill in a sergeant 's uniform . 
  i wonder what greece is doing here . 
  i ca n't quite make it out . 
  is he cleaning blood off his sword ? 
  did he accidentally cut his own fingers off ? 
  is he preparing his sword for war ? 
  spain and portugal seem to be conferring sneakily about something , whilst spain is fingering a large , awkward looking knife . 
  i do n't know what this signifies . 
  maybe spain 's weapon industry profiting ? 
  let 's see , who does that leave ? 
  ah right , the north african dude looking up thinking `` those dudes are crazy '' . 
  that 's what i can glean from it . 
  happy to be corrected and/or added upon . 
  that 's the ottoman empire , by that time known as the ` sick man ' of europe . 
  they were essentially bankrupt due to mismanagement and that resulted in european banks having a lot of leverage over the ottomans . 
  yep , you 're russian 's canteen . 
  this map is from 1915 , before your independence . 
  it 's the internet and it 's full of smartasses , so ask away and someone will answer , then someone will correct , and three comment chains later you 've got a decent plethora of answers . 
  i remember analyzing such posters , maybe even this specific one , many years ago in history class . 
  very clever and well-made , full of great details that give a lot of context . 
  i suspected this particular one is from fairly early in the war , so i did some googling to find it . 
  guardian [ has a pretty cool ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2014/jun/03/war-ww1-propaganda-maps-in-pictures ) gallery of a whole bunch of them from various nations . 
  about this specific one it said :  this dutch map was published in 1915 , after italy had entered the war . 
  the figure representing neutral holland peers over his shoulder at his belligerent neighbour . 
  *** under pressure from germany the artist was put on trial for compromising dutch neutrality , and the germans later put a price of 12,000 guilders on his head . 
  fkn deutschland has no chill . 
  `` regressive left '' is a real term with specific definitions coined by maajid nawaz , a british ` liberal muslim ' and former islamist ( hizb ut tahrir ) . 
  it 's a real thing , but it does n't stop angry conservatives , far-righters ( alt-lite ) , and actual neo-nazis ( alt-right ) from throwing the phrase around willy nilly with no regard for its definition or origin . 
  ^ actual alt-reich alert ^ do n't touch it , people , be careful . 
  the french actually pioneered the ` ultimate ' ship of the line design , the 74 gun two-decker , which offered the best combination of firepower and sailability . 
  and you guys were capable enough at sailing them , until ofc the revolution gutted your naval officer corps ( all aristocracy ) . 
  turns out , naval officer competence is a lot more important than it is for land armies . 
  bit of an oopsy there . 
  however , all in all i do n't think you froggies need to be embarrassed at all about your maritime history . 
  yeah she was built in the 1760s but spent a long time laid up . 
  pulled out of storage and refitted for the napoleonic wars iirc . 
  i doubt she complies with maritime regulations though . 
  surely she 's towed ? 
  a lot of spanish navy officers of the time thought the ship was really only good for harbour defence , given its ridiculous size and mass and consequential unwieldiness . 
  evolutionary dead end in wooden warship design . 
  this is one of my absolute favourite tall ship pictures because there 's not really a ` modern ' thing in sight anywhere . 
  nothing in the background either . 
  no planes , no windmills , no other craft . 
  this is a modern full colour picture that depicts pretty much exactly how the ship would 've looked ` in context ' in the early 17th century . 
  the narrow top deck generated by the pronounced tumblehome shape of dutch merchantmen was partially an intended consequence to avoid taxes levied by the danes for access to the baltic . 
  these taxes were calculated by square area of deck . 
  narrow deck ... low taxes ... still a big cargo hold , 
  sweden is falling apart germany going to shit europe is being raped more hysteria t_d are basically immigrants , comin ' over ` ere , telling us how our societies * actually * work . 
  that 's why people get butthurt over t_d . 
  t_d'ers are cultists who are utterly incapable of having any kind of normal , rational , honest conversation or argument . 
  tnx for the t_d apologism though , oh 14 hr old account . 
  it 's a cult at this point . 
  victory did n't exactly do it alone ofc :p she 's just a reminder of that age and the napoleonic wars . 
  she was n't a superweapon . 
  do n't know if we can really call it ` seagoing ' , but afaik she 's def . 
  the oldest commissioned warship still floating . 
  it 's remarkable how countries start to do better for themselves if you stop shoving massive objects up their arses . 
   also , your cuisine ( kroket , poffertjes ) is popular here . 
  \\* tears of happiness *, 
  where did you get these amazing powers of deduction ? 
  if there was a proper queue , i 'd be more inclined to partake , but it 's a shove-n-elbow type of thing . 
  i ca n't stand the hustle at ht at the food vendor points . 
  will take a thermos of coffee/hot coco and some cookies in winter tho . 
   bonus : take a shot every time t_d poster pretends to be member of another country dude ... you ca n't play that game . 
  that 's alcohol poisoning within the hour . 
  how can there be a normal discussion about it when all that this alt-lite movement does is pretend sweden is a syria-esque warzone ? 
  they keep spamming shit about ` rape epidemic ' and unrelated ` grenade terror attacks ' . 
  that 's not a healthy starting position for what 's actually going on . 
  then you try to bring them down to reality , only to have them say you stick your head in the sand . 
  from my experience , these people do n't want a discussion on failed integration and the issues of parallel societies , they just want you to confirm that sweden is a failed state and immigrants did it . 
  fuck that shit . 
  username checks out !, 
  battiston never forget :( ^ ^ ^ ^ ( also ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ dutch ^ ^ ^ ref ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ calling ^ ^ ^ it ... ), 
  the extra rabat beim mediamarkt bit cracks me up every single time . 
  because regardless of what you 're told on the_dipshit , it 's not fucking real , you cultist dolt, 
  phony padraigs have no craic and their memes are of low quality . 
  the wiki page for `` rape in sweden '' is hardly a convincing direct source for whatever the fuck you 're trying to say . 
  nice job on the copy pasta tho . 
  i mean that according to trump supporters ' logic , this ` soros fucked the uk ' should just be an example of `` being smart '' . 
  in other words , them using it to attack and villify soros is more run-of-the-mill hypocrisy from them . 
   mounds of statistical evidence literally no sources . 
  fuck off with your typical t_d bullshit self-victimizing . 
  wtf , your posts do n't even make sense to me . 
  first off , nice editing your inital post , second , nice moving of the goalposts . 
  third , nice going making zero fuckign sense . 
  fourth , nice substantiated amount of sources you got there . 
  you fucking promised and you broke it . 
  this is why people hate you t_d participants . 
  i wonder how many evangelicals were swayed for trump because of the ( r ) and pence . 
  ** rape crisis : ** - sweden has a low stigma associated with rapes and sexual violence , leading to more people feeling comfortable reporting it to the police ( compared to , say , saudi arabia for an extreme example ) - swedish law has , since 6-8yrs or so , a pretty broad definition of what constitutes rape . 
  broader than nearly all western countries . 
  - swedish ` rape statistics ' count each and every single incident as a single count of rape . 
  if a man rapes his girlfriend over the course of a weekend , that might be four , five , six , whatever singular counts of rape . 
  as opposed many other western countries , where that weekend 's events would be counted as one rape . 
  - if a rape charge is dropped , it 's not removed from the statistics list . 
  take all these together , and you can debate for weeks whether it 's right or wrong to do it like that , and it is impossible to deny that straight up one-to-one comparisons of swedish sexual violence statistics with other countries is very poor methodology . 
  and quite dishonest . 
  however , that does n't prevent an influx of t_d users parroting this `` sweden rape epidemic '' narrative without understanding a single bit of the facts .
