  ** grenade terror attacks : ** these are organized crime gangs chucking ` nades or other ( improvised ) explosive devices at each other . 
  why explosives ? 
  partial loophole in swedish law that makes it far less ` legally risky ' than firearms on one hand , availability of such weapons from , as i understand it , the former yugo bloc on the other . 
  however , that does n't prevent an influx of t_d users parroting this `` sweden grenade terrorism epidemic '' narrative without understanding a single bit of the facts . 
  what you think is happening is not what is happening . 
  if i explain it to you , will you promise to take it seriously and not deflect or ignore ? 
  wotan give me strength to deal with this idiocy ... 
  does n't that just ` make him smart ' using trumpian logic ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsdy9-mqq4u ) is an awesome one . 
  [ or , this supremely spicy 1975 tune from zambia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87njvizfggm ), 
  ships are launched before they are completed . 
  the launch usually refers to the actual launch of the hull from the dock into water , after which most of the fitting out process happens . 
  so a ` launched ' ship can be anything from a nearly empty hull to a fully completed vessel . 
  and if it 's just a hull , you can just moor it somewhere and do n't worry about it too much . 
  you can still finish it years later . 
  you would n't do that when it 's occupying a valuable drydock space tho .

  i 'm not saying someone shoud n't be judged or scolded for making a racist remark without racist intentions , but let 's at least recognize that person as a minor cunt compared to the full klansman supreme cunt . 
  it is known . 
  botswana is awesome . 
  they even have metalheads !, 
  i know plenty of people who will argue it was never a ` choice ' to support a particular club :p, 
  one has to admit that at least there are very different shades of racism though . 
  grandpa who thinks that italians are lazy is n't nearly as deplorable as literal nazis . 
  a fuckknuckle yugo hooligan insulting a black player with a racial slur does n't necessarily hold the same ideology as a white supremacist . 
  there 's definitely a difference between saying racist things and truly believing racist things . 
  serious question : where do you get this stuff ? 
  like , who told you this and why did you believe it ? 
  in force . 
  the sweden stuff rustled their jimmies as well . 
  they 're all trumpeting about rape reports and grenade attacks now . 
  concern trolling , trying to spread anger , disseminate misinformation . 
  they were n't exactly vague on the altright sub that democracy could be a tool for what they ultimately want . 
  just as it was a tool for hitler . 
  not really , but sycophants from t_d add even less . 
  trump could stomp a baby to death on the white house lawn and these maniacs will defend him . 
  you ca n't reason with cult members . 
  if you were referencing it directly , great job . 
  if it was just an observation , [ you have no idea how correct you are ] ( https://twitter.com/iammoallim/status/516029321514074113 ) !,

  prof. calculus [ demonstrating his ` savate ' kick ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1e/calculus_savate.png ) in flight 714 is one of my favourite panels from the entire series . 
  this is mostly due to the introduction of haddock ( in the crab with the golden claws ) , who takes over as the deuteragonist from snowy . 
  snowy still has his moments , but you 're right that he 's never as verbally active or cheeky anymore in the later stories .

  best bot on this entire website . 
  because it 's such an out of the blue , left field accusation that t_d does that , right ? 
  t_d would never do that , right ? 
  never done that , right ? 
  not like they 're the most blatant example of it on this entire forum , right ? 
  how could i have ** possibly ** come up with the idea that t_d likes to brigade ? 
  no precedence !, 
  suggesting hitler is a bad guy and racism/apartheid is fucked up = lect wing propaganda now ? 
  never mind , you post in t_d . 
  two day old account with that name , im saying trump troll . 
  hes from t_d so yeh , probably, 
  but we * are * better by a lot of metrics ? 
  us is only numba wan for citizens incarcerated and unpresidented narcissism . 
  itt : many triggered trumplets from the_fuhrer on damage control brigade mode . 
  edit : majority of replies to this comment : t_d posters , trump apologists , and one few days old account lmao . 
  cheers for proving the point . 
  i loved that drawing style . 
  biggles comics as well . 
   my mother threw them all away because she thought it was just garbage . 
  how did you end up disposing of your mother 's body ?

  you 've been thinking about this way too long xd i think one interesting aspect is the ability of the chimp to take physical punishment . 
  theres a fascinating story floating around somewhere online from a fit athletic guy fooling around with a tame , young chimp that got a bit rowdy . 
  constant amazement from the big guy in how unfazed this little chimp was by the severity of his moves trying to get it off . 
  - farage stubs toe - farage blames eu for bed post location regulations, 
  i did add a `` probably '' in my hafhor vs. chimp ( adult and pissed off ) equation , when your initial comment even spoke of a hafthor vs gorilla scenario . 
  i think there 's no doubt in the latter . 
  no unarmed human stands a chance against a gorilla . 
  no scholagladiatoria ? 
  shamefur dispray !, 
  the difference in strength between hafhtor and a fucking gorilla is insane though . 
  do n't downplay that . 
  hafthor would probably get destroyed by an adult , pissed off chimpanzee . 
  let alone an actual gorilla . 
  `` woman who voted for the face eating leopard party shocked that leopards ate her face . '', 
  how can you have such strong opinions on something that you are so blatantly misinformed on ? 
  seriously though . 
  aaaw , are you offended by a dumb joke ? 
  i thought your kind hated the snowflake mentality . 
  guess not . 
  mountains ?!, 
  food , booze , music , * and * mountains ?

  i do like food , music , and booze ...

   sorry about the whole 1776 thing , we were just edgy teenager that were mad you would n't let us be our own person .
