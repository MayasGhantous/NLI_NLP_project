  and i 'm * so * fucking tired of trumptards . 
  go back to the_leader . 
  there 's not a single europhile who would disagree that the eu could n't improve or do with more transparency , so what 's your point ? 
  does that single article suddenly prove your sweeping assertion , t_d poster ? 
  someone asked a question and instead of responding with the actual eu anti-corruption legislation , you have an article ready on copy-paste to spread your trumpian point of view . 
  is n't there some nato rule against members threatening each other with military action ? 
  wtf, 
  could you tell us more about this , two month old unflaired account that posts in t_d ?? 
  t_d user peddling anti-jewish conspiracy theories . 
  `` muh ( ( ( soros ) ) ) '' colour me surprised . 
  with its first post in the_donald of all places . 
   you can return your ~ ~ western ~ ~ civilization id card at the nearest office . 
  :p ` ere we go, 
   to the dutchman it 's not a swamp : it 's a project !,

  for the kinku, 
  the anti-perkele front is victorious once more !, 
  boh , it 's not the only phrase relating to the medieval era that is often misused and abused in general language . 
  i 'm a stickler for clear definitions and i see little purpose to heaping all forms of very different structures under the same umbrella when there are clear distinctions to be made . 
  merrian-webster 's definition is awful in this case , yes . 
  my physical copy of oxford 's says : castle : ** 1 ** a large strong building with thick high walls and towers , built in the past by kings or queens , or other important people , to defend themselves against attack btw , why is the picture i posted not a castle to you ? 
  `` a massive or imposing house '' is that not a massive or imposing house ? 
  yup . 
  rebuilt in the early 18th century in that typical ` schloss ' style . 
  tis true . 
  ray comfort 's revolutionary `` banana theory '' has fully discredited that evolution nonsense . 
  that 's more like a castle + + . 
  a fortified town with a citadel , and the citadel is also a castle . 
  i 'd say something like [ bodiam ] ( http://visitryebay.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bodiam-castle-near-rye-bay3.jpg ) is amongst the most castlely of castles . 
  one can get through the gatehouse windows with a normal ladder :p fortified my ass . 
  shame about the downvoterinos . 
  it could certainly be considered a stronghold considering its position . 
  but all of the fortifications are purely cosmetic . 
  they do n't actually ` work ' . 
   `` the other guy is far more condescending '' https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5qt52w/castles_oft_europe_schloss_neuschwanstein_germany/dd26tvt/  `` if you want to suck his dick '' well , you do come into a discussion between me and him purely to tell me i 'm condescending and you 're downvoting because i 'm incorrect ( i 'm not incorrect . 
  the first two allegations are debatable , but i 'm not incorrect ) . 
  that 's a bit odd . 
  could 've just kept your mouth shut instead of rudely interjecting and circlejerking with the other guy over a shitty , incomplete definition that 's worth nothing . 
  but w/e , downvote away and have your little circlejerk . 
  this is the only correct response . 
  okay . 
  [ this ] ( http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/4f7dfb3ceab8ea546f000007/the-10-biggest-homes-in-america.jpg ) is a single , massive house . 
  you 'd call that a castle ? 
  not much of a wine drinker here ... surely you have some nice beers in moldova ? 
   as far as the whole castle thing goes , i really like [ this guy 's video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfvdv5j3q5s ) on what makes a castle a castle and the differences with other types of fortifications or structures that are often ( and in my and his , erroneously ) called castles . 
  also a frenchie in the comment section offering some valuable insight on the usage of the word ` chateau ' :  `` actually , the word `` ch\u00e2teau '' in french was n't synonymous of `` castle '' or `` fortress '' at all until the xvith century . 
  before this period , castles in french were actually reffered to as `` forteresses '' ( transparent translation ) or `` castels '' ( singular : `` castel '' which led in english to the word `` castle '' ) . 
  and the exact definition of a `` ch\u00e2teau '' is a building with a living room , a bedroom and a kitchen ( there could be more rooms obviously ) . 
  so the french word actually insisted on the residential function of the building without any consideration for a defensive purpose . 
   thus , in medieval times in france , `` le ch\u00e2teau '' usually reffered to the part of the castle were people ( the lord owning it and his relatives ) lived while the entire complex would be reffered to as a `` forteresse '' or `` castel '' . 
  i know a very precise exemple : the local castle of my town ( montargis in the middle of france , at the south of paris ) , which was a royal castle built by the king phillippe auguste had a specific building separated from the rest of the structure which would accomodate the royal children . 
  this specific building had a living room , a kitchen and two to three bedrooms and was called `` le ch\u00e2teau '' . 
  this distinction was mostly influenced by the difference between such a building with various rooms having a precise purpose , and popular houses often composed of one huge and only room where an entire family would live ( which was standart in rural areas ) . 
   fun fact then is that nowadays , many people could claim that they live in a castle according to the historical definition of the term . 
  during the xvith century , writers began to reffer to every prestigious buildings as `` ch\u00e2teaux '' ( which is why we translate it in english using the word `` castle '' ) by convenience and distinguished the heavyly fortified medieval castles as `` forts ch\u00e2teaux '' or in a more actual formulation `` ch\u00e2teaux-forts '' . 
  thus , versailles , chenonceaux or chambord are `` ch\u00e2teaux '' and the castle of caen or the high koenigsbourg for instance are `` ch\u00e2teaux-forts '' . 
  this also implies that in french , the dinstinction between a fortress , a castle or a mansion is very difficult to establish , even if defensive buildings dating back from the xvith , the xviith or later centuries may be reffered more often as `` forteresses '' and not as `` ch\u00e2teaux '' anymore . 
  then , english speaking authors would pick the word `` ch\u00e2teau '' to reffer to prestigious buildings according to the most recent use of the term in french . '' as you can see , it 's easy to get confused by how these specific terms evolved in use over the years . 
  i love history and the medieval period and to see someone posit , with a lot of certainty as if they could n't be wrong , that a castle does n't need to be fortified makes me wtf . 
  i was n't even * that * dickish about it . 
  i 'd rather be a dick and correct than a circlejerker and wrong . 
  your merriam webster defines a castle as ' a big and imposing house ' . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.colourbox.com/preview/1632086-modern-house-skyscraper-on-the-bright-blue-sky.jpg ) is big and imposing . 
  people live there . 
  is it a castle ? 
  according to you it should be a castle . 
   `` a castle ( from latin : castellum ) is a type of fortified structure built in europe and the middle east during the middle ages by nobility . 
  scholars debate the scope of the word castle , but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castle private , fortified residence of nobility . 
  yeah im sure its a coincidence that my two replies to you were downvoted within a minute . 
  according to your definition , a castle doesnt need tobe fortified . 
  this is an exceptionally dumb definition that isnt shared by any dictionary . 
  a treehouse isnt a castle . 
  a castle is a fortified residence of medieval nobles . 
  thats what a castle is . 
  not a palace . 
  not a chateau . 
  and certainly not just a big house . 
  a skyscraper or a mansion isnt a fkn castle . 
  your own first link specifies fortifications , ya dipshit . 
  if a castle doesnt need defenses , a treehouse is a castle too . 
  it obviously isnt . 
  and remember reddiquette , mr downvote . 
  a castle does not need to have defenses ? 
  uuuhm , lol , yes it does ... a chateau is a chateau . 
  a castle is a castle . 
  its a palace , not a castle . 
  its not a properly defendable structure . 
  `` alternative fact '' . 
   and having her slowly take control over much of your life this is such a tired bullshit argument ... edit : it 's funny seeing the comment karma shift during the night . 
  those americans knowing all about eu oppression , eh ? 
  no , it 's like breaking up with your girlfriend and have her assert that you 're a manipulative , oppressive control-freak that 's ruining her life . 
  but she still wants to be friends and use your car . 
  but ... that 's just a fact . 
  an actual one . 
  you said that right , you alternative xl belgian . 
  coooommie , commie , commie , commie , commie , [ commie leon ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/lev_trotsky.jpg/220px-lev_trotsky.jpg ), 
  i think it 's too late . 
  they tunnelled under their own wall years ago , with help from the nefarious french . 
  i exhaled loudly through my nose whilst cracking a smile .
