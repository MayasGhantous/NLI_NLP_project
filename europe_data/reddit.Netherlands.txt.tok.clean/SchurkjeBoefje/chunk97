  good job being funny there , alternative kaaskop . 
  ha , the american south is in north africa and the middle east !, 
  that makes * so * much sense !, 
  as i understand it , one of the problems regarding this is that ` gypsy ' people who do n't follow the traditional lifestyle kind of ` fall off the map ' as ` gypsies ' . 
  there are plenty of roma/sinti/that third one i always forget descent that live normal lives in a normal home with normal families and normal jobs and normal golden retrievers and normal opel astras , so they 're not seen anymore as ` gypsy ' . 
  so the only visible elements of gypsies are the ones with the whole traditional lifestyle thing . 
  and they do cause a ton of problems . 
  but ` globalist ' is a normal phrase not necessarily connected with neo-nazis ? 
  why would we make their definitions the default ? 
  that 's what they want . 
  the last thing i want is an even more disgruntled uk kept in the eu against their will . 
  that would just be ammo for populists . 
  the public wanted out . 
  the uk needs to go , if only for the sake of the eu itself . 
   render their opinions invalid without debating them . 
  real talk for a minute : go and visit the altright sub . 
  read what they talk about . 
  then ask yourself if those people are worth debating and if their ideology and arguments are to be normalized . 
  please . 
  go look for yourself what they are all about . 
  oh yes , let 's take the feelings of the actual neo-nazis into account , poor oppressed babies !, 
  it was a subtle way of pointing out that the poster i replied to is a contributor to the altright sub . 
  irrationalism also depends on the cult of action for action 's sake . 
   action being beautiful in itself , it must be taken before , or without , reflection . 
  thinking is a form of emasculation . 
  therefore culture is suspect insofar as it is identified with critical attitudes . 
  distrust of the intellectual world has always been a symptom of ur-fascism , from hermann goering 's fondness for a phrase from a hanns johst play ( `` when i hear the word ` culture ' i reach for my gun '' ) to the frequent use of such expressions as `` degenerate intellectuals , '' `` eggheads , '' `` effete snobs , '' and `` universities are nests of reds . '', 
  the official fascist intellectuals were mainly engaged in attacking modern culture and the liberal intelligentsia for having betrayed traditional values .

  ikr , what 's up with that smell ? 
  such a musky , hidden fart type of odour . 
  it 's not as aggressive and penetrative as chicken or pig shit , but rapeseed fields do have that stifling , covering musk that just layers itself over you . 
  blegh . 
  you just secured yourself a spot on the shortlist for minister of creative revenge when i finally take over the world . 
  but the vast majority of high level american politics * is * impacted ?? 
  conservative estimates are that at least 20 % of the us population is not religious . 
  yet senate and congress do n't even get close to that for proportionate representation . 
  so there are either no or hardly any atheists in senate or congress , or dozens of senators and members of congress are forced to hide their beliefs ( or lack thereof ) for fear of being unelectable otherwise . 
  let 's be honest here , if a us presidential candidate came out in 2019 as an outspoken atheist , that could very well amount to political suicide . 
  how is that not an actual , serious problem ? 
  if candidates have to claim x or y because the electorate would not elect them if they were not x or y , then that society is politically heavily slanted towards that x or y. 
  the notion that you 're denying that this is a real issue in the usa is also beyond silly , and i ca n't really take you seriously anymore if you 're going to downplay it . 
   because to state you are christian is a no risk , no effort way to gather a votes ( or prevent losing ) uuhm ... that would say i 'm correct ? 
  that to prevent losing a high stakes national election , a candidate * has * to claim they 're christian . 
  it might change in the future , with the boomers dying as you say , but as of right now ... it 's hard to argue otherwise . 
  socio-politically on the highest levels , the usa is half a theocracy .

  excellent , my children . 
  carry on . 
  cynical me would say that is because a considerable part of americans ( 25 % ?

  my understanding of texas is that there 's a world of difference between austin and say ... abilene . 
  i think it 's pretty much undeniable that being a christian ( on the face of it , at least ) is a necessary factor to be electable for higher national offices in the usa . 
  on the whole of it , when it comes to your elected officials in the public eye , there is no separation of religion and politicians . 
  not a christian ? 
  you 're nearly unelectable . 
  do n't even think about it .

  okay , you 're just trolling now . 
  yes yes , the jews will eat your babies . 
  go back to your neo-nazi sub . 
   there were a lot of jews in the german army , fighting for germany in ww1 , which is quite a pickle in their `` jews are sinister and are n't loyal to no country '' mantra . 
  they 'll just regurgitate the same propaganda from 80 years ago .

  `` they barely had combat roles . '',

   `` the amount of times you used `` vindictive '' in your post suggests that you 're unconsciously susceptible to adopting other people 's language and then substituting other words with it due to cognitive prevalence . 
  having used the word `` poisonous '' quite a number of times also suggests this about you . 
  i would therefore ask , sincerely , when and how you came to learn and start sprinkling the word `` rhetoric '' around ? 
  i suspect two or three years ago your usage of `` rhetoric '' was grossly disparate to what it is now . 
  ask yourself why that is . '', 
  totally not assuming or belittling , that . 
  based on my repeated usage of two words , which can have various reasons , you go on a little rant that implies i 'm throwing certain words around because i 've recently learned them , planting the sneaky suggestion that there 's no way i possibly could have learned about the term ` rhetoric ' until relatively recently . 
  i 'm throwing buzzwords around that i could n't have learned ` organically ' is the suggestion here . 
  this , at the very least , comes across as pretty damn belittling to me , especially the way you phrased it , especially given the greater context of the conversation . 
  what is even more striking to me is that with that comment you appear to be interested in languages , yet you totally fail to see how your reply comes across .
