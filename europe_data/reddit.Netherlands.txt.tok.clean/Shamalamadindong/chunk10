   nobody ever gave you the authority to decide what the referendum was or was n't about . 
   many of these reasons can perfectly be adressed by adjustments to the agreement . 
  what gave you the right to decide on one or more reasons ? 
  from the questions it sounds like you want british people to respond . 
  maybe you would be better off posting it in uk related subreddits . 
  the pvv our version of ukip/front national set up a website where one could report on poles `` stealing jobs '' or otherwise causing problems . 
  implying the money would otherwise be spent on such things ... 
  do n't forget the poles !, 
  its only been 2-3 years since geert wilders opened his `` polen-meldpunt '' . 
   sits on his ** balkan ** ass ... 
  merkel , merkel , merkel . 
  you would think she was empress of the eu with how people keep blaming her for everything . 
   right-winger , who says we are being robbed by the eu , and he 'll respond that our independence is being sold to the eu basically right-wingers in every eu country . 
  buts that 's not really anything he can personally influence . 
  and almost 70 % do n't care . 
  the eu did nothing because most of its member states were wholly content with plugging their ears as if nothing had been going on and there was no refugee crisis . 
  despite years of turkey , greece and italy asking for help . 
  well what do they expect ? 
  `` fuck you erdogan '' and torpedo the refugee deal ? 
  4 options . 
  the terrorists ship him off to russia where he gets accused of some bogus attack on russian civilians and he gets a lengthy prison sentence . 
  the terrorists hold him for 6 months to a year and eventually exchange him for goods or captured terrorists . 
  un backed strike frees him , wwiii happens . 
  they kill him , wwiii happens . 
  what no quips about him not being a `` real '' frenchman ? 
  well why not at this point . 
  it appears its going to take another hitler or major european war to remind people of why the eu exists . 
  strictly speaking a nexit referendum ca n't happen because referendums can only be held on laws passed since the creation of the referendum law . 
  but as far as i know there 's no frequency limit . 
  you get the signatures and whatever vote you want is n't against the constitution and you can have a referendum at 40 million euro 's a piece as often as you want . 
  of course the real question is ... toy saddam ? 
  and did it come with a noose included ? 
   near poverty ? 
  did you see the refugee camps we built ? 
  you do realize those only house a fraction of the total number of refugees right ? 
  did n't this project fail because he could n't cope with some windmills off the coast ? 
  i can not take that name seriously . 
   they found a trove of extremist literature , including tracts titled `` thirty-eight ways to participate in jihad '' and `` sixteen indispensable objects to own before going to syria . '' he was a jihadi buzzfeed ? 
  the tabloids strike again !, 
  on the ukrainian side . 
  so not whoever is in charge of the dutch side of the investigation . 
  exactly how does a croatian turn in to an american redneck libertarian ? 
   but gays i hate , not for their sexual orientation , but as people . 
  explain that to me . 
   21 % of russians want lgbt people ` liquidated ' i do n't know about russians but i found a croatian just a couple of posts above yours . 
   one one hand i am very liberal are you certain ? 
  you obviously have the numbers to back that up . 
  actually to a point it actually is . 
  swedish housing policy just dumped them all in the same area 's , does n't exactly help . 
   in the 80s we had the ethiopian famine and we sent millions / billions in aid to help a but that 's just it , we did n't this time , or at least not to the degree which was clearly needed . 
  this time around the problem moved itself closer to us in response to relative inaction . 
  there 's also the fact that economic conditions are different these days . 
  most refugees are ending up in turkey , lebanon and jordan . 
  these countries have higher living standards then 80s ethiopia had and thus shit costs a lot more . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_sweden ** foreign born citizens possibly qualified as refugees . 
  ** ** iraq ( 130,178 ) ** influx has its ups and downs depending on the situation in iraq but most ( 2/3 ) came in te last 10-15 years . 
  ca n't find any solid info on unemployment . 
  ** iran ( 68,436 ) **  according to a 1996 study , iranians had the fourth-highest rate of unemployment among ethnic groups in sweden , largely the result of the labor market undervaluing and/or not recognizing their education and credentials . 
  according to the 2004 labor force survey , the unemployment rate among the iranian foreign born in sweden was 20.4 percent . 
  http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/iran-vast-diaspora-abroad-and-millions-refugees-home from what i 'm reading this has since improved significantly but again no solid sources . 
  ** former yugoslavia ( 67,892 ) ** older wave of refugees , ca n't find any recent stats . 
  ** syria ( 67,671 ) ** i think we can safely assume most of those are very recent and still working their way through the system and getting themselves set up . 
  ** somalia ( 57,906 ) ** coming across 60 % to 80 % unemployed . 
  unable to find decent data on recent unemployment rates or when most of them came to sweden . 
  severe search results pollution by british tabloids . 
  ** bosnia and herzegovina ( 57,289 ) ** older wave of refugees , ca n't find any recent stats . 
  interesting article i came across .

   now , if this encounter really did happen -- and many have their doubts -- it was a rude and ugly thing for him to have done . 
  harassing somebody on the street because of their assumed religion certainly is . 
   ` the terrorists hate our freedoms ' , people say . 
  is anyone really still repeating that bush era bullshit ? 
   angry tweeters , the easily offended , time-rich policemen ... some people at the very heart of our societies seem to hate freedom too and want to rein in the right to speak freely . 
  we have to defend our values against both nutters with bombs and a pc mob with twitter accounts . 
  of course most of these cases come down to some asshole saying or doing something really offensive/stupid . 
  the `` pc mob '' is societies way of saying `` do n't be an asshole '' . 
  unfortunately there are then a lot of assholes who loudly declare `` i have the right to be an asshole and i will harass you in to acknowledging me !, 
  fezzes are cool .

  [ it 's good for you !, 
  regarding the connection between association treaties and membership people like to bring up . 
  turkey has had a treaty for 53 years , still not a member . 
  context : the treaty your comment : `` giving 45 million poor people a passport to all of eu '' implication : treaty = instant passports for 45 million ukrainians = membership, 
  do n't try to dig your way out of this , we both know membership is inevitable . 
  you implied this treaty would do it . 
   eu members i must have missed the part in the treaty that said anything , at all , about membership . 
  31 . something %, 
  go back and inform yourself on what visa free travel actually means .
