   you ca n't make a nation take in people that are n't theirs . 
  yet that is exactly what people here are proposing . 
   and who exactly would do something about it ? 
  i do n't know but keep in mind that this shit works both ways . 
  nigeria for example could decide to strip gays of their citizenship and put them on an airplane to europe . 
  so let me get this straight , you want to take away somebodies citizenship and then deny them their day in court because they are not a citizen ? 
  kafka would be amazed . 
   if they no longer have eu citizen there 's no need for court cases . 
  anyone who is n't an eu citizen we can just give the finger and tell them to fuck off . 
  that would be the thing what the court case would be about . 
  * funded by possibly of course , though if they were as subversive and effective as some would claim you would expect to see thousands of would be terrorists , not dozens . 
  well they certainly did n't learn it in a school in pakistan did they ? 
  edit : speaking of schools , https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/03/23/from-us-the-abcs-of-jihad/d079075a-3ed3-4030-9a96-0d48f6355e54/, 
  everyone agrees * some * of them were french . 
  in any case , these attacks were mostly perpetrated by belgian and french citizens born and raised in belgium and france . 
  to then say `` oh we 'll strip them of citizenship and deport them to the country their parents or grandparents came from '' is a bit unfair to those countries is n't it ? 
  its our mess , not theirs . 
  maybe , and only after a very lengthy and costly court case . 
  tell me about it . 
  geert wilders ( the farage of the netherlands ) opened his `` polen meldpunt '' in 2012 where people could file nuisance complaints against the polish people in the netherlands . 
  that 's sort of glossing over the countless assassinations , coups , human experimentation and countless other inhumane shit the cia has done ... 
   `` how to make ** artisanal ** bombs in the name of allah . '' isis hipsters ? 
   after i finished all the process we started to chat and he got a little bit more `` friendly '' and told me that there was no point in pressing charges , they were not going after stolen bikes . 
  show me a country where that 's not the case ... 
  the joke in my country is that if you get your bike stolen you can just buy a `` new '' one from a junkie on the street corner . 
  and that 's not some recent increase in eu wide unsafety , that 's just life . 
  new info says it was the nypd , not the fbi . 
  you shit in the streets ? 
   our societal model depend on extremely high ** social ** and cultural ** cohesion ** . 
  [ i know its sweden but i assume denmark is somewhat the same . 
   only observing that this sub as improved over the past year . 
  if you consider a massive influx of hate speech an improvement . 
  i 've read just about everything here in the last 6 months ranging from calls for concentration camps for muslims to calls for outright genocide . 
  you quoted out of context , own up to it and move on . 
   i was talking more about horrifically maiming and killing innocent people in public places with no warning because they feel insulted or because a 3000 year old book told them to . 
  but that does n't really have anything to do with modernization does it ? 
  there have been christian terrorists , sikh terrorists , hindu terrorists , jewish terrorists , etc. 
  terrorism is unrelated to how `` modern '' the culture or society the terrorists come from is . 
  also , what is the future like ? 
  assuming you come from the future and not from some steampunk-esque past . 
  assimilate how exactly ? 
  people seem to ignore that the vast majority of shall we say the `` unhappy and/or radical element '' was ** born ** here . 
   maybe in the future , when islam catches up with the modernisation of hindu i 'll eat my shoes if the rate of arranged marriages among hindu 's is lower than among muslims . 
  public health , yes . 
  long term fish sustainability , hell no . 
  [ istanbul ] ( https://youtu.be/wcze7egorok ), 
   britain must ` proudly ' defend its christian values catholic , protestant or anglican ? 
  and what if the rest of the world started parachuting the criminally inclined with serbian heritage over serbia ? 
  or if you had bothered to read a couple of posts you would know that that was the original bbc article title . 
  i am now using both left and right extremities to blow wind over your head . 
  i thoroughly disagree with that . 
  right and left extremities did a lot of good for many european countries and continue to do so . 
  maybe he had it transplanted from his head to his arms to keep warm ? 
  cut the bullshit , this is about anti-eu parties framing it as a referendum on the eu itself . 
  one might dispute that how she got the fine is wrong , i do n't know the details so i 'm not going to judge that . 
  but not paying a fine naturally results in a reaction by the entity which levied the fine . 
  tl ; dr pay your fines , if you disagree with the reasoning for the fine file a dispute or something . 
  you sure you want to go down that rabbit hole ? 
  plenty of murders , suicides and destroyed lives have been caused by sensational and/or outright false journalism . 
   part of the regressive left . 
  if you ca n't see the difference between asking if somebody supports fighting for isis or fighting in syria in general what does that make you ? 
  the poll asked about fighters in syria , that can be anyone from isis to the ypg to the odd [ american ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/magazine/meet-the-american-vigilantes-who-are-fighting-isis.html ) or even [ dutch biker ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/08/dutch-and-german-bikers-fighting-isis.html ) . 
  when literally one in a million ( + ) turns out to be a terrorist ? 
  yes , statistically it is . 
  at least in the context of linking migration and terrorism . 
  by all means enlighten me on why teens would be eating contraceptive pills as candy . 
  ask the american who responded to him , they have some experience with this sort of stuff . 
   poland to ban prescription-free not misleading . 
  i 'm supposed to present evidence that europe is not a dystopian hellhole with daily bombings , mass rape , etc ? 
  open a window , take a step out of your front door . 
  only in the minds of severely delusional rightwingers who really do n't have a clue how lucky they are . 
  both the idea that the west is not a pleasant place and that lebanon never was . 
   also , we 're kind of used to lebanon 's instability , whereas the west used to be a pleasant place to live . 
  i 'm sorry but . . you arrogant prick . 
  i 'm amazed . 
  [ working link to the letter the embassy got from the turkish government . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qbwacih.png ) it amounts to `` yo , just want to let you know we are putting a eu citizen on an airplane to your country . 
  xxx '', 
  or alternatively , man arrested for being a bigoted asshat and harassing woman on the street . 
  assumptions and stuff, 
  some did , others did n't . 
  however given the fact that again , they were belgian and french nationals they would have gotten in anyway . 
  tell me though , say i knock on your door pretending to be a policeman , you open up and i rob you . 
  would your reaction be to blame the police ? 
  are you denying they were belgian and french nationals ? 
  since when are belgian and french nationals refugees ? 
  do n't worry though , we are paying local warlords to detain them and we do n't really care what happens after they get detained since its no longer our problem . 
  that was n't an extradition , that was turkey going `` take your own trash back '' . 
  is he willing to pay for it ? 
  yea no ... this lists a gigantic amount of things which the general public does not consider a terrorist attack . 
  you consider them foreign by default and then wonder why they do n't feel at home ? 
  so basically they are french only if they walk around with a beret , baguette ans french flag underwear . 
  anything else , no matter how many generations deep is foreign . 
  i get it now . 
  its a lack of wanting to come to terms with the fact that it was our society which created these guys . 
  neither are refugees . 
  no more than 2 years ago it was the polish who were the foreign boogeyman . 
  now there 's a new boogeyman . 
  you do realize its that kind of bullshit which pushes people to radicalize right ? 
  when exactly are you going to consider them belgian or french ?
