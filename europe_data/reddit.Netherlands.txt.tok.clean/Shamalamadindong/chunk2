  so you decided to post this even though it already got posted a mere 6 hours ago . 
   hordes of nonwhite invaders such a non-biased article ... 
  funded and armed by who ? 
  who 's going to train them ? 
  where are they going to train ? 
  the solution is n't to throw more people in to the meat grinder . 
  hell , if you people had kept your noses out of other people 's business for the last decade or two we would n't be in this situation . 
  [ related ] ( http://www.wired.com/2013/07/ikeas-innovative-new-refugee-shelter/ ), 
  excuse me , how the fuck is venezuela considered a `` close '' country ? 
  bullshit , we both know the regular immigration process does n't have room for sufficient numbers . 
  there are a thousand groups fighting in syria and pretty much all of them are bad . 
  because the camps are overcrowded and underfunded maybe ? 
  because the unhcr has had to cut the food budget in * half * the last two years because of a lack of funding ? 
  no , there is n't a war in eritrea . 
  [ eritrea is a lovely place ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eritrea#human_rights ) / s tl ; dr imagine north-korea but in africa ... 
  he went out of his way to not mention religion as a reason . 
  [ and at least one of them has already been proven false !, 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-34176631 ), 
  sort of a `` i know it when i see it '' case . 
  you have been banned from r/pingpong, 
  that is a stupid and unrealistic long term view . 
  what do you mean it happened here ? 
  its no ... i feel ... ghjj ... asdasf ... durka durka jihad !, 
   syrians do not hold much love for them perfect opportunity to change that is n't it ? 
  jesus when did they put that website together ... i 'm betting its all hard-coded html pages . 
  he does n't . 
  this is one of those bullshit anecdotal things that gets passed around on facebook or that chain email your slightly racist grandparent sent you . 
  and your biggest claim to fame is a guy who got turned in to a blood sucking monster by a brit . 
  somehow if you slap a couple million worth of lights on the outside it would n't look out of place in vegas . 
  well we still have frank and goth refugees from 1500 years ago !, 
   if you did not make promises the refugees would have stayed in turkey you have your timeline mixed up . 
   at the very least , as was proposed several times , they should stay in greece , get processed there and then distributed across europe if they meet the asylum requirements . 
  if , and only if we actually help greece . 
  if not i fully support greece opening the gates . 
   if you refuse and throw away free food you 're not actually all that hungry in the first place . 
  which is sort of the point ... they were n't hungry , they were wet and cold and had been stuck on the border for 3 days . 
   but admits there were people loudly screaming `` not halal '' one . 
  one guy , possibly . 
  tl ; dr not really . 
  as it turns out they had been there for two or three days stuck in a no-mans land between greece and macedonia and it had been raining for two hours . 
  their main concern was getting over the border and out of the rain . 
  or hes just smiling at the camera ... 
  i bet you 99 % of them do not speak a word of arab . 
  i 'm guessing somebody pissed off the farmers ? 
  power failures cause spikes in the birth rate 9 months later . 
  why ? 
  because during a power failure you do n't have anything to do . 
  guess how much fun it is to sit around in a refugee camp all day ? 
  crazy idea , maybe turkey should be handing out free condoms in the camps ? 
  i like to argue politics so , 
   if those countries then reached saturation point , only then should they even be considered for refugee status . 
  they already have , we do n't notice or do n't care . 
  keyboard warrior . 
   building refugee camps and providing all this money , food and medical assistance to displaced people is more than enough . 
  except we are n't really doing this . 
  nothing really . 
  even if hypothetically such actions would `` work '' its still going to take at least 6 months to filter through all the way to the guys packing their bags in turkey or lebanon . 
  and then what ? 
  fortress europe ? 
  your just off-loading the problem on other countries , some of which ca n't really afford to deal with it . 
   and wilders simply is n't even an option for many voters . 
  lets hope so . 
  complaining is a national sport here . 
  all the parties are shit would be the general sentiment here  our next election will likely shake things around though . 
  the vvd is going to lose some people to the pvv vvd = business liberal conservative party but without any of the religious family values bs . 
  they are going to lose some people to the pvv because of eu and immigration stuff . 
  pvda = labor , generally considered sellouts at the moment , has been one of the two major parties for decades but if the trend holds they will lose big at the next election . 
  on the other hand they are the party which usually has the largest boots on the ground capabilities during election time so who knows . 
  sp = socialists , untested , they have always been in the opposition and there is some doubt over whether they could actually deliver if they get a lot of seats . 
  cda = christian democratic party , up until recently they were always one of the two or three major parties but recently they have taken a bit of a tumble , they are unlikely to recover anytime soon because their voter base is literally dying . 
  pvv = our ukip/anti-immigration/anti-eu party , unique in that the legal entity which is the party itself only has one member , its leader [ geert wilders ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02919/geert-wilders_2919766b.jpg ) . 
  d66 = social-liberals , sort of your go to centrist party if you get sick of your usual party . 
  have the moronic idea to implement an american style presidential system . 
  cu = christian democratic party , the christian part is a bigger deal then it is with the cda . 
  gl = leftist but with a focus on enviromental issues . 
  sgp = fundamentalist christian party . 
  the kind of party you vote for if you go to church every day . 
  have never in their 100 year existence held power . 
  has only recently allowed women to be elected . 
  pvdd = animal rights party 50plus = pensioners party, 
  [ merck toch hoe sterck ] ( https://youtu.be/-zudrbmhia0 ) victory song written to celebrate the end of a 3 month siege by the spanish on the city bergen op zoom . 
  how though ? 
  what exactly are the problems ? 
  wait who are the insane ones ? 
  sp , our socialist party . 
  i do n't agree with them on their anti-eu stance by the way . 
  i 'm voting sp because the other major leftist party , the pvda ( labour ) keeps marching lockstep with the vvd ( liberal ) . 
   attitude towards russian speakers somebody explain to me why this seems to be such a massive issue in eastern-europe . 
  so is the white privilege tumbler joke post . 
  and i have seen more of these joke posts in the last couple of months then i will ever see * real * tumblr white privilege posts . 
  and where is the money going to come from ? 
  the unhcr has to beg every year for funds to keep the current camps running . 
   exactly , this is how we get people trying to establish sharia-controlled zones in london , and sharia governed schools where girls are left behind and marginalized . 
  i 'm not going to bother with a witty comment . 
  these people think you are being ridiculous , https://youtu.be/hz4xueiknfq https://youtu.be/ljf2zxyyjea and the bonus , https://youtu.be/a5gg7gdk5qk, 
  but does that objectively matter if they generally are n't bothering anyone ? 
   but here in sweden foreign born people make up 16 % of the population , but they snag 66 % of the welfare money . 
  * * not a real statistic, 
   whe should reform things somehow that usually ends up fucking over the people who are n't exploiting . 
  it could still go either way , utopia is still an option at this point .
