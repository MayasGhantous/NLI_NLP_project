  proper funding of refugee camps in turkey , lebanon and jordan . 
  as long as we do n't do that they will come this way . 
   only people taken directly from there or from neighbouring refugee camps , by some sort of joint eu task-force for saving refugees directly from the conflict , can be considered such . 
  [ read this earlier comment of mine . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/40mtne/in_light_of_the_cologne_attacks_we_need_to_face/cyvl4s2 ) same thing as camp funding really , as long as we do n't make a real effort they will keep coming this way on their own . 
   would n't it be an option to do the application processing in greece ? 
  i imagine something along the lines of setting up eu-financed centres in which refugees stay for a few weeks or months until they 're granted asylum or deported if not . 
  certainly . 
  no eu member wants to foot the bill though . 
   authoritarianism was a hallmark of the right wing in the last century . 
  in this century , it is fast looking to be the calling card of the left wing . 
  and yet its again the right in power in many countries who are passing ridiculous anti-terrorism laws . 
  why does the right always have this persecution delusion ? 
  and yet thousands upon thousands of miserable assholes show up to support the unspeakable ones , even when thousands of miserable assholes like me show up to protest against the unspeakable ones . 
  and every single time after some shouting and a couple of bottles thrown at the police we all go home and rant about it on the internet . 
  could n't find anything on lisse and the one in utrecht was apparently preaching politics at school . 
  also , pretty much everything you have talked about happened over a decade or more ago ... 
  party membership lists are not public and despite what you say there are plenty of people who turn up to meetings which wilders attends . 
   presumably , that would only ramp up support more . 
  hes the only legal member , unless he put something in the statute the party dies with him . 
  fun fact , geert wilders is the only official legal member of the pvv , that way he does n't have to hold party votes on policy . 
  the official resettlement process is a joke though . 
  125.000 worldwide since 2013 . 
  now consider that there are about 6 million refugees in turkey , lebanon and jordan and at least another 6 million internally displaced in syria . 
  http://www.unhcr.org/52b2febafc5.html there were some interviews on dutch tv with syrians in camps in turkey a while back who were trying the official way , their initial intake meetings were set in 2017 , ** 2017 ** !, 
  if i had any cash on my paypal i 'd give you gold . 
  finally someone who actually knows what is going wrong . 
   and european nations are providing financial support , alongside supplies . 
  would it surprise you to hear that less then 20 % of the refugees in turkey are actually in a camp ? 
  we failed four years ago when we collectively decided to ignore the looming refugee crisis and hoped we could just dump it on lebanon , turkey and greece . 
   the eu did resettling years ago , did n't stop the current influx . 
  no not really . 
  we were pretty much content to ignore the whole thing until late 2014 / early 2015 . 
  hell there are people in those camps who have been waiting for years just for the initial intake meeting . 
   i do n't know but i suspect ** a thousand ** rampaging men tends to drive the normal people away . 
  that was apparently not actually the case . 
  just regular nye crowds . 
  so finally after god knows how long we finally have our first real life genuine refugee terrorist ? 
   why would germany need us troops ** active ** on their national territory ? 
  they 're already there . 
  yea there 's some statistics fuckery which made it appear like it rose significantly . 
   this is not a referendum about ` further delegation of authority to the eu ' . 
  sorta the point . 
  nope . 
  they did n't start it . 
  they certainly did a great job at making people think they did though . 
  lets not pretend like this referendum was a `` thing '' before geenstijl hijacked it . 
  `` democracy '' . 
  they feel the eu is n't democratic enough and that this is somehow a good way to protest against that . 
  in reality though the geenstijl crew ( geenstijl means nostyle ) just love to kick against the established order . 
  we have a weird brand of nationalists here . 
  left off center but only as long as any benefits of said policy goes to what they consider to be `` real '' dutch people . 
  yea geenstijl is the outlet that hijacked the entire thing . 
  90 % of them barely even know what its actually about . 
  we have some rightwing media in our country which has convinced most of the population that its some sort of referendum on the existence of the eu . 
  we did ? 
  when ? 
  that 3 billion we have n't actually given them ? 
  and how exactly did that `` university '' not get shut down ? 
  oh i know . 
  we do n't have to give it to turkey , we could easily contract some business or charity to do it . 
  or for once we could give the unhcr all the funds they 're asking for . 
  til . 
  not anymore apparently though , http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/14/london-mayor-boris-johnson-to-renounce-us-citizenship, 
  lets start with enough so turkey , lebanon , etc can actually build enough refugee camps . 
  less then 20 % of the refugees in turkey for example are in a refugee camp . 
  and nike 's he bought in austria !, 
  / s how is this news ? 
  yes please , if only for the theatrics . 
  we could have the decency to actually pay turkey , lebanon , etc. 
  ( and no , that one time $ 3 billion does n't count , that covers like 6 months ), 
  no , its ignoring the problem . 
  you just dump it on somebody else . 
  that said at least australia has the decency to pay somebody else to take the problem off their hands . 
  all greek soil . 
  and dumps the problem on greece . 
  out of sight out of mind . 
  a border fence between greece and bulgaria/macedonia would just return us to the situation of two years ago . 
  i 'm all for investing in refugee camps so they stay over there . 
  people like me seem to be the minority though , most people seem to think you can just build a wall and be done with it . 
  see that 's what a lot of people think but in reality we have barely made an effort . 
  less then 20 % of the refugees in turkey for example are in a refugee camp . 
  better yet , why do n't we take that money and spend it on proper refugee camps in turkey , lebanon and jordan . 
  by all means lets hear his suggestions on securing a million tiny little islands some of which you can almost literally jump to from the turkish coast . 
  that 's what we get for ignoring a problem for 4 years . 
  what muslim community though ? 
  muslims do n't even show up in the statistics for slovakia . 
   2nd/3rd generation migrants aka french born citizens of france, 
   and let the refugees stay in refugee camps . 
  not actually a thing , the lack of proper camps is why so many are coming this way . 
  how about collectively spending about 10-15 billion/year so they stay over there ? 
  we do n't need a fence , what we need is adequate support for refugees in turkey , lebanon and jordan . 
   send them back to camps in countries near syria . 
  there 's no room . 
  less then 20 % of the refugees in turkey are in a camp . 
   and how many `` christian terrorists '' grew from the families of the 9/11 victims ? 
  how many joined the military to go `` kill some ragheads '' ? 
  why would you * not * want to look like that :p, 
  expensive hobby though if you go beyond the single rifle/handgun . 
  context :  `` these are downloadable images that are a few weeks old .
