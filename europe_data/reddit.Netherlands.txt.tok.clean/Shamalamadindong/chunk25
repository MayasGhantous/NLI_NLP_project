   not sure , but i have the impression that `` lefts '' and `` liberals '' are way more violent in ** recent times ** than so called `` far rights '' and `` neo-nazis '' , on their protests . 
  is it true ? 
  and in a thread about germany . 
  in germany ? 
  news to me . 
  we * are * discussing germany here . 
  it balances out . 
  leftist political violence will usually be during counter protests . 
  rightwing political violence will usually be nightly vandalism and hooliganism . 
  regarding who is more violent , who knows . 
  at least leftists are n't firebombing refugee centers . 
  its always britain too . 
  you do n't see `` immigrants living in 1.5 million pound london flat '' news headlines anywhere else . 
  if i buy bottled its more about needing the bottles then about drinking the water . 
  difference is that now the eu coastguard will be responsible . 
  europe ca n't just go around blaming greece anymore . 
   is this the right place to inquire ? 
  i do n't know , i 'd consider systemic abuse by a who 's who of society 's most powerful to be somewhat more important but i get the feeling its getting swept under the rug . 
   that might seem a little abrasive , but if you were familiar with the dialogue surrounding this phenomenon you 'd know that your question is the fallback position of many eager to relegate the importance of tackling this problem via the notion `` we 're all as bad as each other '' , suggested by their promotion of a coterie of white pedophiles . 
  as opposed to that guy ranting about white slavery ? 
   it 's dismissive , and it shows little understanding of scale ( estimates of 1400 girls abused in a single town , ** estimate of 1m nationwide ** ) and urgency ( it is ongoing ) . 
  i 'm taking that with a very very large pinch of salt . 
  on the subject of sex abuse , any news on the saville , mp 's , powerful guys case ? 
  did he not get allowed in to art school ? 
  just stop it . 
  you have to be completely delusional to think all these people decided to come to europe just because merkel told them they could . 
   preceded in that case of course by mass protests , unrest and an actual dictator being in power . 
  136 upvotes, 
  why do you think my comment has so many upvotes ? 
  could it be that you misunderstood it ? 
  your first comment i could n't tell if you knew english , with this one i 'm not certain if you are serious or joking . 
  i 'd say that depends on what fn decides to do with its new power . 
  civil war is unlikely but if they pull any bullshit there 's certainly going to be mass protests . 
  rephrase that comment , it does n't make any sense . 
  preceded in that case of course by mass protests , unrest and an actual dictator being in power . 
  i like how the pm makes an effort to save the flowers :p, 
   this argument that they ca n't hold refugees does n't stand up . 
  * all * , you are forgetting the word * all * . 
  so what ? 
  they strip before they go in ? 
  could have fooled me . 
   every person with common sense would say : hey let 's support turkey and lebanon with money and other resources so they can deal with the refugees . 
  and yet after 5 years the unhcr still has to literally beg for funds . 
   they should have either stayed in turkey or greece . 
  both of whom do n't actually have the infrastructure to take care of millions of refugees ... 
  i 'm getting sick and tired of britain threatening to leave just to get their way . 
  leave already . 
  tyr sounds like i should understand it but i do n't . 
  its having the same effect as [ prisencolinensinainciusol ] ( https://youtu.be/gu4w12odjn8?t=1m46s ), 
  russia , arkona germany , rammstein and bonus non-european and non-english , [ ali farka toure ] ( https://youtu.be/qi_h49d1xo8 ) just because hes awesome . 
  i 'd completely agree with you if our government had any serious intention of properly funding refugee camps in the region . 
  as long as the governments of europe do n't i have no problem with them coming over here . 
  australian judge : * that would explain why you came to the wrong court mate . 
  i 'd say that was pretty much the intent of the wording of the title and article . 
  on page 2 and too late . 
  your average sun reader will gloss over the apology and keep believing the story . 
   syrian education quality is n't up to par with western standards to put it mildly . 
  is that backed up by any objective research or just `` obvs these savages are stupid '' ? 
  this this this . 
  we need something grand which does n't just focus on a handful of historical characters . 
  worse yet , he recently played a belgian bar owner in the tv show [ crimi clowns ] ( https://youtu.be/e6f78tl_qz4?t=3m5s ) , hard to take him serious as a grand historical figure after that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_white_queen_ ( tv_series ), 
  looks like the same release up on kat . 
  not actually 720p unfortunately, 
  imagine 95 episodes covering about a hundred years of romanticized history with two dozen major characters . 
  [ shitty quality fanmade trailer ] ( https://youtu.be/aijgv3fv_po ) basically the chinese got except with a smaller budget and no nudity . 
  a european equivalent to [ three kingdoms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_kingdoms_ ( tv_series \\ ) ) might be nice . 
  take a period of say 100 years with a lot of conflict , focus on a half dozen bordering countries and throw in a good budget and army cooperation for extra 's . 
  maybe a couple of episodes on the distant conflict with the ottomans . 
  maybe one on the attempted invasion of malta . 
  for those who do n't know , the nice thing with three kingdoms is that it is n't filmed as separate episodes , you can pretty much watch it as one gigantic long movie covering + / - 100 years, 
  [ maybe he took these idiots seriously ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/fzi82f3aakq ), 
   tax hikes on who ? 
  the shipping magnates or the common folk ? 
  some might say it was a deliberate attempt to evoke a military response by iran ... 
  alternate title , eu finally comes to its senses and realizes it ca n't just dump this problem on turkey and the border countries . 
  generally the entire fucked up situation can be traced back to a dozen or so bad decisions . 
  one of them is the support for the saudi 's . 
  sykes-picot , the creation of saudi , israel and pakistan , the interventions , etc imagine if the west had thrown its full on support behind the hashemites , mosaddegh and a dozen other moderates 60 years ago ? 
  smaller market for it but there 's always something . 
  i 'm assuming they 've also stopped selling anything kosher ? 
  it better be . 
  a one time 3 billion euro 's does n't even begin to make a dent . 
   i was thinking more along the lines of 200k full stop and then we take no more . 
  500k is quite a lot to feed , house , educate , police , provide healthcare to etc. 
  especially since we 've some of our own people to take care of who are in desperate poverty . 
  consider for a moment that you are saying this to countries like turkey and lebanon . 
  lebanon for example , a country of 5-6 million citizens with 2 million refugees in it . 
  keeping yourself in power 101 , 1 . 
  do not piss off truck drivers . 
  do not piss off farmers . 
  ( unless you want a mountain of manure on your doorstep ), 
  but we do n't do we ? 
  i 'm going off google translate , did i inadvertently say `` surprise < something sexual  '' ? 
  russia will likely either team up with europe or with china , iran is a wildcard . 
   we are not helping those in the most dire need at all . 
  we already are n't doing that . 
  we ignored the refugee crisis when it hit the region , we ignored it when it hit greece and italy , we only started panicking when they started showing up on our doorstep and as long as we do n't organize some sort of meaningful assistance for the region i am 100 % pro open borders . 
  i 'm just talking syrians here .
