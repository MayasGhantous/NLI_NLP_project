  this war did n't start last year you know . 
  we had our chance to deal with them in the region and we blew it . 
  there 's a difference between integration and just throwing them in a room together and hoping for the best . 
   many first came because of ideological reasons ( religious persecution etc ) [ small sidenote , the `` pilgrims '' went to america so * they * could persecute others . 
  ] ( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/americas-true-history-of-religious-tolerance-61312684 ), 
  [ have fun with alex jones  ] ( https://youtu.be/ivtyc6chmnu ), 
  [ yup , the finland variation on rush limbaugh/alex jones . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/koet3k4uei4 ), 
  the finland variation on rush limbaugh/alex jones ? 
  of course those states are usually also the most densely populated and border states with far less restrictive gun regulations . 
  it was a joke ... 
  at 180 % tax would n't it be cheaper to get a friend to buy one in germany and sell it to you `` second hand '' ? 
  or does the 180 % also apply to private resales ? 
  there 's a logic issue there since i 'm assuming they do n't have a `` male guardian '' standing in the back of the classroom . 
   most americans do n't seem to get the us constitution well can * you * read 200 + year old cursive ? 
  swimming classes i can sort of understand but what is the issue with field trips ? 
   it has ugly multi-clause sentences , obsolete wording and often describes things in an unnecessarily high abstract way . 
  is n't that just a short description of the german language ? 
  the difference is that japan has a general dislike of any and all foreigners in larger numbers . 
  in europe the dislike is based on religion and/or skin color . 
  i mean you see somebody hanging a thing like that there are only two options , movie filming or secret nazi cabal taking over . 
   do n't you think that giving better conditions for the europeans and stimulating the birth rates of the native population is better than importing mostly male uneducated refugees ? 
  in theory , yes . 
  that does n't solve the refugee problem however . 
  or the fact that many `` native europeans '' simply do not want children . 
  `` i 'm just like this great well regarded dead guy !, 
  vote for me ! '', 
  should be enough left over to paper the walls with . 
  i mean , technically that 's still better than being an anti-corruption officer with $ 120 million in cash stuffed under your bed . 
  yes , surprisingly , firebombing a place of worship without regard for anyone inside out of political motivations is terrorism . 
  even if you are an idiot . 
  in europe * ^ * greece ^ and ^ italy ^ excepted, 
  stopped about halfway through , which is likely later than most . 
  the guy needs to be a bit more concise . 
  sorta what happens when you stick it to your own political base but ca n't satisfy the opposition either . 
   also if you think the article on the whole is about dietary practices , i would suggest lighter reading material . 
  as long as he refrains from specifics i will read it as being about dietary practices . 
  speaking of unexpected , i wonder if joe biden still works . 
  well call me if it starts affecting them . 
  so far everything people like wilders , or more recently zijlstra have brought up have been bullshit . 
  tl ; dr author disturbed over fact food producers will produce food in a such a way as to make it widely exportable . 
  except ... they do ... and will often charge you for doing so , compounding your debt problem, 
  well at least its somewhat relevant . 
  us perturbed by russian troops in ukraine . 
  or for that matter , insulting to the painter and to modern cartoonists . 
  not the same thing though . 
  i 'm not going to get denied a loan because i 'm not in their records as opposed to with the concept of credit scores . 
  so happy this is n't a thing in the netherlands . 
  pay your taxes and respect privacy laws and you will not have a problem . 
  how obscure are we talking here ? 
  there 's no clergy license . 
  and to add to that , how many were under 18 when the procedure started . 
  so t-shirts for buddhist monks ? 
  here 's the problem , the discussion right now is focused on headscarves , burka 's and kippas . 
  many people consider it reasonable to ban these . 
  however ... would you ban the dalai lama 's robes ? 
  [ patriarch kirill 's folding hat ? 
  also anthony bourdain visited him in his turkey episode . 
   if you need to teach these people how to behave toward women to treat them equally which is very fundamental thing here in europe might as well kick out half of eastern-europe ... 
  50 years of elections . 
   btw , i thought vp is a pretty much representative position , does he hold any real power while p is still in charge ? 
  he will certainly be in a position to influence p. prime example being the dynamic between dick cheney and george bush . 
   hold on there , stalin . 
  what is radical christian about trump and why is it a threat , considering his voters are definitely much more fundamentalist ? 
  vp , not p. mike pence . 
  climate change denier , promotes teaching creationism , rabidly anti-abortion , anti-gay and even anti-condoms . 
  and hes part of a much larger movement in american christianity which thinks the same way . 
  buddhists in myanmar . 
  see , http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/04/dutch-tourist-faces-two-years-in-burmese-jail-for-pulling-plug-o/ note that police had to hold a crowd back from lynching him , they only dispersed after they promised to prosecute him . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/world/asia/religious-violence-myanmar.html jews in israel , http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/12/151224-israel-jewish-terrorism-arson-christian-church-multiplication/ http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/world/middleeast/west-bank-arson-palestinian-toddler.html http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israels-jewish-terrorist-problem christians , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wisconsin_sikh_temple_shooting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord%27s_resistance_army http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/15/yes-there-are-christian-terrorists.html and lets not forget the far more insidious threat , takeover from within . 
  there 's a radical christian running for vp of the us right now . 
   the replacement of european culture next you will start ranting about cultural marxism wont you ? 
   but radical jews and christians are n't the problem . 
  * in western-europe, 
  bad development . 
  this will add at least 6 months to the trial . 
   these people are coming to kill , torture , and rape . 
  students ? 
  i 'll bet you $ 10 the perpetrator is a student at the school and not a muslim . 
   if showing the germans clapping their hands , giving flowers , shouting `` refugees welcome '' on the news across the whole world is not a huge pull factor as has already been pointed out this was way after we started seeing a huge uptick . 
   more than eight-in-ten american muslims say suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilian targets are never justified ( 81 % ) how high is the percentage with non-muslim americans in the context of `` collateral damage '' ? 
  my guess is they would end up locking up a student at that school who did n't realize he was making a very stupid and inappropriate joke . 
   french police unions complained angrily on monday about being sent into gang-ridden `` no-go zones '' uhm ... that is your job . 
  simple , temperate climate , plenty of resources and a lot of international trade . 
  if china at a crucial point in time had not decided to go isolationist we would likely be speaking chinese right now . 
  tl ; dr belgian police system is dysfunctional . 
   you prove your loyalty to your new home country by renouncing your old citizenship . 
  ancient bullshit , one would hope we are beyond blind loyalty like that these days . 
  makes you wonder what they might be planning ... 
  there there , it was all a nightmare , go back to sleep and suck on your precious freedumb \u2122 . 
   youngsters looking to get work experience funny joke . 
   and university students looking to offset their fees hilarious . 
  my guess ? 
  the uk rejoining some form of eu . 
  without farming subsidies ? 
  good luck . 
   members must have their own views represented . 
  which , ironically , is one of the major causes behind dysfunction . 
   who have been expressing concerns about eu policy on immigration for a decade maybe they should have been expressing that concern to the businesses hiring eastern-europeans ? 
  invading afghanistan does n't pay that debt though .
