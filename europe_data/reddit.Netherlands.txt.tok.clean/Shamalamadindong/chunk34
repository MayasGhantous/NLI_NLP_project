   with a social state that is collapsing not happening . 
   and a country that is unsafe . 
  it is * always * unsafe considering you are more likely to die in a car crash than you are by a terrorist attack . 
   i am not sure if you are real , or just a bot that posts that whenever i say anything just when i happen to run in to you . 
   the one thing that would change his opinion on that is if turkey would be allowed to join . 
  has n't really been a thing for years , no matter how much the right wants to make it a thing to keep people in fear . 
  if that happens i 'd start looking at connections between them :p, 
  ignore this troll . 
  [ he once told me he 'd like to liquidate `` the gays '' . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4e7fyf/half_of_british_muslims_want_gay_sex_banned_says/d1xxt4u ) ( he removed the liquidate comment but that is the comment chain ), 
  we had a great bullshit example in the netherlands a couple years back . 
  a road construction worker got fired supposedly for lack of available work , to keep his benefits he had to go do ... road construction . 
  * with the same company * . 
  and where are they supposedly going ? 
  pretty much every destination outside of europe will be less safe . 
  nah they are pretty much the immigrant version of the pvv . 
  oh bullshit , they knew . 
  what do you want to bet if the government starts looking in to the financials that they were paying below minimum wage ? 
  so what was it ? 
  terrorist attack ? 
  lovers quarrel ? 
  mafia hit ? 
   regressive left will have a blast with this story . 
  still looking for any evidence of the existence of this so called regressive left ... 
  that was what it was ? 
  reading the news one would think it was a silk screened custom made 2 by 3 meter flag hanging on the wall . 
   and the gluten guy . 
  lol, 
   no it \u00b4 s just that the netherlands always have been an utterly boring place throughout its whole history . 
  i take offense to that , we had some damn good riots in the 80s . 
  morbid curiosity on my end . 
  i would like to invoke rule34 here . 
  never underestimate the power of bureaucracy . 
   and that 's huge by the scale of europe ? 
  a 320 million or some such continent ? 
  510 million , counting just eu members . 
   the aim was to highlight the pc hungry culture we live in and how it 's often used to ` straw man ' a whole host of concerns these days not unlike the accusation that one is being politically correct ... 
  is it the heat or something ? 
  terrorist attacks , shootings , stabbings , a damn coup attempt and even that israeli gay pride attacker nut . 
   we 're really trying to get better , but the economic situation is so bad . 
  maybe it would help if the military did n't run the entire economy ... 
   ( and genuine refugees as we took them from the refugee camps ) is the smartest decision i have ever witnessed my country take . 
  and thank you for doing so . 
  many other countries ( including mine ) complete half assed official resettlement programs . 
  http://www.unhcr.org/protection/resettlement/573dc82d4/resettlement-other-admission-pathways-syrian-refugees-updated-30-2016.html yes , that 's 208.000 spots , worldwide , for a refugee population of ( officially , its more ) aprox 5 million people . 
   the urge to blow myself . 
  that is quite difficult though , do n't you have to get a rib removed or something in order to be able to do that ? 
  http://cache2.asset-cache.net/gc/483706032-traditional-kebab-preparation-with-turkish-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=iwsasset&amp;k=2&amp;d=gzwkvmqtedqtir6pzhqbfdk1dchxoyda9jtxpzqftk7uhirmj4hqkradbvr0cnkpfouy72o7bbg7bzji7dbvkq%3d%3d it looked like that but different colors . 
  the getty page appears to be offline but it was titled `` traditional kebab preparation with turkish machete '' . 
  so yes , it was a kebab knife/machete, 
   as said i 'm really sick of it now and i want to help the rest of the people who are n't raping , killing or stealing . 
  just remember that that also includes the vast majority of refugees . 
  greece , for anyone wondering . 
  attention seeking asshole . 
  a study ? 
  an actual number ? 
  anything ? 
  would you rather have had concentration camps 2.0 ? 
  ah yes , a four paragraph article with no citations or solid numbers . 
   the way this refugee acted is normal behavior for them slaughtering your girlfriend in the workplace is normal ? 
  must be a lot of cleanup on aisle seven in the middle-east ... 
  so your saying that if you committed a serious crime in germany you should be deported immediately and otherwise get off scot-free ? 
  well its been 14 hours , ready to admit that maybe you are a paranoid idiot ? 
  he attempted to kill himself twice and was in a psychiatric facility for a while , its entirely possible the previous violent acts were related to that instead of criminal/intentional violence . 
  should n't he maybe spend some time in prison first ? 
   the coastal government controlled areas risks being drafted . 
   the kurdish controlled areas in the north logistical issue as turkey would not want to cooperate . 
  not going to speculate on that . 
  we 'll hear it in the morning when the relevant government department opens up and looks through the paperwork . 
  [ no ticket apparently . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ihspf6x1fdo ), 
  ca n't exactly deport to a warzone . 
  no homo though / s, 
  damn , i read an excellent article detailing the history and subsequent problems with this initiative a couple of months ago but i ca n't find it anymore . 
  a definite number , a percentage ? 
  any actual source ? 
  a lot of bullshit gets blamed on the eu these days . 
   brexit won simply because enough people felt that the potential economic cost of leaving the eu was worth the ability to limit immigration which , at 336,000 net per year , is three times what is was in the 1990s , according to the guardian newspaper . 
  guess again , according to that same guardian article a significant chunk of that increase has been because of students not leaving after they are done with their education and sticking around . 
   brexit won simply because enough people felt that the potential economic cost of leaving the eu was worth the ability to limit immigration which , at 336,000 net per year , is three times what is was in the 1990s , according to the guardian newspaper . 
  conveniently failed to differentiate between eu and non-eu migration . 
  over half of that is non-eu migration , something the british government is perfectly able to lower but for some reason does n't , probably because it would hit the bottom lines of tory party donators . 
  and guess what ? 
  eu membership or no eu membership , that non-eu number is n't going to go down as a result of brexit . 
  i 'm saying using either/or as a way to visualize two independent pieces of data is n't exactly the best way . 
  oh yes ... certainly not an agenda behind that one . 
  [ they are in `` good '' company ... ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4u9ne0/tanzania_bans_lubricant_in_bid_to_curb/?ref=search_posts ), 
   to stop kids from competing with each other on who has the latest fashion . 
  has this ever actually been a thing ? 
  lies , he was at the grassy knol with the lizard people overseeing the killing of the last human american president !, 
  extratorrent , they are home to the ettv and etrg release groups . 
   ** radical ** fundamental islamic causing the trouble . 
  lots of people do n't make that distinction . 
  imagine playing pokemon go and having a battery pack attached to your phone :p, 
  it did n't , or at least not beyond early 2015 when that line was still very likely to be true . 
   these jihadists are roaming the streets of istanbul hunting for `` secularists '' . 
  that one is a joke right ? 
  a comic sketch of some kind ? 
  is that dude on skates ? 
  nobody knows , but i look forward to the jokes about it on the big fat quiz of the year .
