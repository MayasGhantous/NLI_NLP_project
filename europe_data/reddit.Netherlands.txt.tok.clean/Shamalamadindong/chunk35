  congrats , we just pinged . 
  native population does n't fuck . 
  no foreign population to do the fucking with/for them . 
  the result , lot of old people , not many young people to take care of them . 
  double whammy , country has an unhealthy work culture resulting in relatively little free time for a significant part of the working population which likely negates some spending on frivolous stuff . 
  known or aware of ? 
  looks like erdogan 's airplane is landing on istanbul , https://www.flightradar24.com/thy8456/a5a3952,

  britain is the only one who takes this seriously and pretty much the only one pushing it ...

  i have a feeling the turkish pm is going to go down in history like baghdad bob/comical ali . 
   why the hell isnt the eu focusing on this ?!, 
  for example by pledging over 400 million euro 's ? 
  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-16-824_en.htm in case you have n't noticed , inter-eu money talk does n't happen publicly . 
   lets try to help and create appropriate conditions over there , which is a lot more economically effective and we will be able to help more people that way . 
  to which i again reply , feel free . 
  again , a safe country does not equal a roof over ones head . 
   tell me how do they get from syria ( ongoing war ) to hungary without passing a safe country ? 
  when they try to enter hungary , they are not fleeing war anymore . 
  says every country beyond turkey ... greece : `` why do n't they stay in turkey ? '', 
  albania/macedonia/bulgaria : `` why do n't they stay in greece ? '', 
  bosnia/serbia/croatia / romania : `` why do n't they stay in albania/macedonia/bulgaria ? '', 
  etc , etc , etc. 
  and the answer is simple , because lebanon and jordan are at their limit , because turkey can barely manage to take care of 3 million refugees , because greece is in the middle of a hellish recession and simply does n't have the money , etc , etc. 
   and even so , the number of terrorist attacks in russia , from muslims in the caucasus , is pretty high . 
  the brutal dictatorship might have something to do with that . 
  besides , that 's mostly an ethnic/tribal issue . 
   i havent heard any discussions about financial aid , have you ? 
  irrelevant , poland could and should unilaterally give more . 
  your argument comes down to `` nobody is officially telling us to do it so we do n't do it '' . 
   you really have some kind of polish complex , you keep `` attacking '' the fact im from poland . 
  just because you are polish , there are plenty of other european countries who could and should do more . 
   on what basis are you claiming these are refugees and not immigrants . 
  country of origin and common fucking sense . 
  * that would be russia, 
   so you agree these are not refugees seeking asylum , they are people looking for the best comfort of life - economic immigrants . 
  in that case , why does any european country have to take them all in ? 
  https://youtu.be/hpjvdqvx_dc why did n't they just stay in europe ? 
   hmmm ... maybe because eastern-europe is poor compared to the west ? 
  so poor you ca n't manage more that a couple million ? 
  please ... you waste that much on corruption while i sneeze .

  point is , pretty much everyone is helping out * except * eastern-europe . 
   what can i say , we are a poor country , but im sure the eu would have a lot better results if they decided financial help is more important , rather then trying to force everyone to take immigrants in . 
  agreed , lets start by using the 82.5 billion euro 's being invested in to poland by the eu . 
   and how many wanted to stay in poland ? 
  why force these people to live somewhere they dont want to be ? 
  read the third article i linked . 
  would you want to stay ? 
   so they are not refugees , as far as i know , a refugee seeks asylum in the first safe country possible . 
  economic immigrants cherry pick and go where there are the best social benefits . 
  safety does n't put a roof over your head , and neither does poland apparently . 
   you know there are other ways of helping them , not just taking them all in ?

  fuck debate when your supposed solution is building a wall and otherwise ignoring the situation . 
  ignoring the situation is how we got here in the first place . 
  as if you care . 
  hell as if poland cares , with your 900 offered spots for resettlement of syrian refugees . 
  no , they have good editors who know how to pick images which evoke an emotional response . 
  alternatively they could lead with an image of a damp cloth but that would n't get people to read the article would it ? 
  have you been here in the last 12 months ? 
  there are open relatively frequent calls for mass genocide in immigration/muslim related threads . 
  you can bet your ass the original article filled the entire page . 
  that is such a fucked up train of thought . 
   the millions of islamists other eu countries let in . 
  maybe you should take a critical look at your own immigration policy regarding commonwealth countries ? 
   in light of the court ruling it is now looking like the home secretary 's actions have led to somewhere in the region of 50,000 students being unlawfully deported from these shores . 
  that 's 50.000 students who might convey their experience to another 500.000 potential students ... 
  democrrrrracy manifest . 
  `` right ... '' thank god its not my problem anymore . 
  did anyone force you to stop trading with the world or did you simply stop making stuff people want to trade ? 
  that would mean the number of sexual assaults has doubled in the last few months . 
   just to be clear , these two are sexual assault cases like the majority of the 1200 . 
  the majority was simple muggings . 
   makes me wonder why i so , so rarely stumble upon `` rightist '' . 
  does n't sound as nice grammatically speaking . 
   there were cases where they made fake emergency calls to the police and threw rocks from rooftops when they arrived . 
  amateurs . 
  / s https://youtu.be/p_m3dsvlewm, 
   according to the poilce there where 1200 victims . 
  from wikipedia , by 6 april , the number of reported crimes in cologne was 1,529 . 
  a total of 1,218 victims were involved , 529 of which were victims of sexual offences . 
   up to 2000 men where involved do we have actual conformation of that ? 
  by my best understanding at the time that was certain foreign press running with a botched translation . 
  this is a joke right ? 
  too bad the old folks did a `` screw you , i got mine !, 
  in reality though he was n't smuggling his lunch .
