  he was smuggling lunchboxes . 
  they say of the acropolis , where the parthenon is ... 
  you are of course completely incapable of showing it now . 
   the referendum may have been an advisory one , but that does n't make it any less politically binding . 
  does n't the change the fact that nobody seems to want to be responsible for actually doing it . 
   ( throws chair ) yup , hes british . 
  assuming we can get over our obsession that people have to work for money and goods . 
   good thing that the labour membership represents the whole electorate , huh ? 
  it 's not like polls of the general public show poor approval of corvyn or anything . 
  irrelevant . 
  the general public does n't get to vote on party leadership . 
   `` the most popular brand among the invaders on their robbery and rape campaign is red bull , '' she claimed bizarrely . 
  that 's a lie , if it was they would be flying over the border instead of walking . 
   there will be no ww3 unless russia fires its nukes first . 
  it wo n't fire nukes unless nato invades russian clay i think in the russian psyche small tactical nukes are perfectly reasonable . 
  i 'm going to guess that there 's the business premium tax involved . 
  indeed !, 
  how dare they try to counter some of the outright bullshit anti-eu propaganda right wing tabloids spew on a daily basis !, 
  neither is a military coup just to get their democratic rights out of the way ... 
   but i would rather have 4 poles for every muslim that comes to this country . 
  one pro brexit thing is that at least a lot of brits now feel more comfortable to admit they are bigoted . 
   but the vast majority do n't live in the camps . 
  kinda my point . 
   and the fact refugees are free to live/work in turkey so a lot of them seek jobs in urban areas . 
  recent change in policy . 
  and one that is yet to be fully implemented . 
   you seen the reaction to trump calling for imo a sensible ban on muslim immigration totally sensible . 
  / s  because eastern europeans ** are white ** it is not so they get thrown in front of the bus , which is a shame . 
  only until the perceived muslim problem goes away . 
  after that goes away they can go back to their former second class citizen status . 
   he 's safe in turkey . 
  we should be aiming to take in the folks in the severely unfounded camps first and foremost . 
  there 's roughly at least 2 million of them right there in turkey . 
   i mean eu immigration i.e. 
  immigrtaion from eastern european countries . 
  i have a far bigger problem with pakistan/bangladesh immigration which can be controlled to some extent most people screaming about immigrants do n't actually realize the difference ... 
   1 ) immigration has to be curbed if it is going to have legitimacy the problem with this premise is that it ** is ** severely curbed . 
  to the point where getting in legally for whatever reason takes years and years , a mountain of paperwork and a part time job worth of time . 
  and that 's for `` wanted '' immigrants . 
  as for unwanted ones ... i remember an interview dutch tv did last year with a syrian refugee in turkey . 
  his * initial * `` hi how are you , so you want to come to the eu ? '', 
  meeting was planned for ** late 2016/early 2017 ** . 
  the big fucking problem is that people do n't actually know what kind of immigration they do n't like . 
  they think they do n't like immigration in general when in reality its usually brits complaining about commonwealth immigration or inter-eu immigration or other western-european 's complaining about eastern-europeans or descendants of guest workers from the 60s/70s . 
  not when you make fake promises about 350 million based on a lie . 
  `` 1,000 artists object to idea that google/youtube can do whatever the fuck it legally wants '' . 
  said artists are free to pull all their content from youtube and use the notoriously strict contentid system to insta-dmca any and all unauthorized uploads of their content . 
  but they wont ofc . 
  hitting ? 
  [ this is a hit . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f6b0h2v.gif ) what juncker did was mild slapping . 
  i 'd say tipsy , not outright drunk . 
  edit : rule of law is every time drunk juncker gets posted somebody inevitably posts [ drunk yeltsin . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/v9yndirqwt4 ), 
  menacing stares !, 
  also , til american police are more ridiculous than british press . 
  more turkish tourists ? 
  ever consider the truth may be somewhere in between ? 
  deport muslims , close borders , leave eu and everything will magically be better . 
  you do n't need a majority for that , we have more than 2 serious parties here . 
  and ? 
  better source ? 
  last year . 
  and ? 
  because naturally the eu is going to produce anti-eu propaganda ... 
  mandarin for one . 
  breathing is a provocation to russia . 
  maybe we should stop wasting it ... 
   northern cyprus : the product of turkish invasion in 1974 , and the subsequent ethnic cleansing of 200,000 greek cypriots , and colonization of the area with mainland turks . 
  not the entire story of course ... for one you forget to mention the greek coup which happened 4 days before the invasion . 
  not that i agree with turkey 's subsequent actions mind you . 
  you realize of course that visa free travel does not entitle one to a permanent stay , housing , jobs or benefits right ? 
   in my town they 're constantly arrested for violence , drinking heavily , littering , fighting , drink driving and a few murders . 
  sounds just like british tourists in amsterdam . 
  [ correct . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/pwealgealhq ), 
   christ we need another war or something . 
  leftist here , i hope you guys lose just like last time . 
  point made i guess . 
  though maybe they need an eli5 channel . 
   if regular people do n't know shit about it , is n't that proof that it fails in its function to inform the consumer ? 
  the eu could start a 24/7 tv channel in every member country which does n't do anything other then explain eu policies , decisions , etc all day and people would still be un/misinformed . 
  did the brits vote for cameron ? 
  or for that matter , boris johnson . 
  thing is , leave is somewhat more permanent than remain . 
   bureaucratic inefficiency rather vague is n't it ? 
  every government like body has bureaucratic inefficiency . 
   lack of exposure elaborate ? 
  a lot of eu funded shit clearly says somewhere that its eu funded . 
   and transparency on what happens with eu money [ have fun . 
  ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/budget/www/index-en.htm )  and how efficiently that eu money is being used again , elaborate ? 
  in terms of fostering growth ? 
  fixing problems ? 
   attitude towards members vs the outside ( like greece vs turkey ) - the case for real european solidarity this would be a `` we '' problem , not a `` you guys '' problem . 
  it takes all of us . 
   sovereignty in cases like refugee quotas [ has n't been an issue for you guys since late last year . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-pm-cameron-confirms-uk-staying-out-of-eu-refugee-quotas-2015-9?ir=t )  the push against the rise of far-rights ( which is bad , but at this stage , brussels should not have a say in this matter imo , it just makes things worse , like when you tell a teenager not to smoke , and then he starts binge drinking ) . 
  we should be a union , not have members pushed around examples ? 
   immigration from outside the eu - solved by , well , not something brexiters would be excited about , but , more eu integration in the form of common , stronger border control for the mediterranean and balkans . 
  again utterly irrelevant since the uk is not part of schengen .
