  there 's a reason that camp is in calais and not dover . 
   they should start fixing a lot of the complaints of the leave campaign such as ? 
  i heard 3 main things . 
  350 million , which was a lie . 
  some incoherent thing about sovereignty , have fun setting your own safety standards again . 
  immigration , even though most of the relevant migration people are angry about is n't eu migration . 
   but there 's been a vote , they should respect that and deal with it . 
  unless it had been 51.9 % remain of course , that would have been clear cause to have another vote in a couple of years ... 
  well lets see . 
  - people who voted solely on the 350 million claim . 
  - people who , in 2 years will realize that stepping out of the eu really does n't have any effect on commonwealth immigration . 
  - people like that idiot on the bbc who already expressed regret at voting leave since he thought remain was going to win anyway . 
   fuck off if 50.01 percent voted to remain you people would be celebrating and declaring it the will of the people . 
  nope . 
  referendums are shit regardless of the outcome . 
  ah but 51.9 % leave is obviously a clear choice by the british people to once and for all get out . 
   i now vote wilders based on nothing more than people like you so as i said , stupid . 
  sometimes you have to be intolerant of stupidity for the greater good . 
   the brits voted leave because they were sick of the federalization , the authoritism , the democratic deficit and the burgeois elite taking a shit on everyone who is not them no , they voted leave because of an imaginary 350 million and because of commonwealth immigration which will continue regardless of eu membership . 
  of course the hilarious thing is that if the vote had been 51.9 % for remain then leave would have been calling for another vote in a couple of years . 
  no fuck that shit . 
  i 'm tired of this bullshit about having to be nice to idiots , fuck it and fuck them . 
  doc is slightly behind on the bbc livestream . 
  obviously he needs the vacuum cleaner to clean up all the menthol cigarette 's . 
  anything under 60 % remain will be used as an argument for another referendum in a few years when the next europe related crisis happens . 
  * strawberries ? 
  * ** barbarians !, 
  ** , ** philistines !, 
  ** , ** dogs !, 
   the thing that 's screwing with our economies is overregulation and punitive taxation we got a libertarian here !, 
  you know what annoys me ... 50.01 % votes for remain and there will be calls for another referendum in a couple of years because after all the vote was very very very close . 
  50.01 % votes for leave and it will get claimed as a crushing defeat of the europhiles and a clear message that europe is no more . 
  simple unbiased fact . 
  from wikipedia ,  there are 10,600 muslims in slovakia . 
  in which case people would be complaining there is n't enough opportunity to make changes or something .

   ** writes **, 
   they are drafted and proposed by unelected bureaucrats . 
  in what country do you think an elected official actually writes his own laws ? 
  its a thin line between serious stupidity and unfunny snark these days on r/europe . 
  there are a million steps involved in making something eu law . 
  r/europe 's response , `` its outta control man ! '', 
  i just ... 
  from wikipedia ,  there are 10,600 muslims in slovakia . 
  tl ; dr nudist club requests privacy screen from local government , government declines request and sends document with standardized public pool rules . 
   in the note sent on monday afternoon , andy palmer , the company 's chief executive , told workers that while `` an exit from the eu would [ be likely to ] have a ** negative effect on uk gdp growth in the near term ... ** the impact of that slowdown in growth on aston martin is likely to be offset in part by the ** depreciation in the pound ** , making our exports more competitive '' . 
  of course , the cia has ambitions !, 
  coups , revolutions , death squads !, 
  and of course these nutters are probably most likely to actually show up . 
  as is just about every elected body in the world ... 
  now take out everyone over 40 and under say 12 . 
  feels like it would have been far more economical to replace the mail boat with something faster . 
   this whole referendum has been a farce referendums on complicated politically charged subjects in a nutshell . 
  he was white though right ? 
  its only relevant if he 's white . 
  its a 50/50 thing . 
  yes there 's the financial thing a lot of people will consider when they see his advert but on the other hand you also have a significant pool of probable leave voters who respect orban for his immigration views . 
   last month the most important witness for the spp `` suicided himself '' by shooting himself in the chest . 
  twice . 
  a yes , the old `` he stabbed himself in the back four times and threw himself off a bridge '' . 
  naturally . 
  after a brexit british politicians will actually have to start taking responsibility for shit . 
  they will no longer be able to blame it on the eu .

  because a brexit clearly changes the situation ? 
   so actually yes this is absolutely about poles , germans , romanians , spanish etc etc. . . keep telling yourself that . 
  we both know / u/suckmyhickory is n't talking about poles or irish . 
  symbolism not your thing i take it ? 
  it plays on the fear of the possibility of an unholy alliance between two weird haired loudmouth politicians , not latent homophobia .

  impossible to calculate unfortunately . 
  you could go purely by unhcr budget funding but these countries are likely spending most of the relevant money in house . 
   you do n't check polls frequently do you ? 
  `` even if you ask something bizarre as `` are reptilians ruling the world ? '', 
  you 'll get around % 7 percent yes . 
  people forget this way too often . 
  as another example , at any given time america turning communist polls more favorably than the american congress does . 
   why did the mps that voted get so many death threats and have to get police protection then ? 
  mp 's * always * get death treats when they vote a certain way on heavily charged political subjects . 
  most of them are from syria , afghanistan or iraq . 
  have you checked the situation in those countries recently ? 
   the cost of having them here is a bit larger . 
  well its what happens when we barely do anything for them over there . 
  by all means write your elected representative and ask him/her to petition the government for more funding for the unhcr . 
  completely agreed , in basically any other situation . 
  a brexit is n't exactly business as usual and would certainly warrant another look at the issue . 
   because europe ca n't take more immigrants without seriously affecting our societies oh come on we both know that is bullshit . 
  1-2 million on a population of 500 + million and we act like the world is ending meanwhile lebanon has 1-2 million on a population of 5-6 million citizens . 
   he said the deal did nothing to address the chronic deficiencies of eu policy , but simply outsourced european obligations . 
  attempts to `` solve '' the migrant crisis in a nutshell . 
  so not even in london . 
   i think the main reason people are leaving is the extra million foreigners we are currently expecting every three years with no end in sight . 
  mostly from former colonies but what the hell , lets ignore that . 
  what 's the point when the opposition can peddle lies about curved banana 's and toaster restrictions ? 
  you are blind i take it ? 
  because the `` problem '' is a self fulfilling prophecy . 
  you realize that would be actively contributing to the `` problem '' right ?
