  the point still stands . 
  i believe morality is relative . 
  20-30 years ago gay marriage was immoral , 50-60 years ago interracial marriage was immoral . 
  morality is n't set in stone thus the only truly moral choice is not interfering at all . 
  ( again , provided the words `` consenting adults '' apply ), 
   ** two consenting adults ** can decide to have sex with ** a child ** with the third person being a child and thus not being able to consent ... 
  why ? 
  the only two words that should matter are `` consenting adults '' . 
  new marriages , ok i can sort of get that . 
  but are they going to tear up existing family units ? 
   sargon of akkad you 'll forgive me for not wanting to pollute my youtube history with that asshole . 
  for context , 15ish million euro 's a year . 
  unless you happen to be the poor polish guy who can go work in a hotel/b & b in britain . 
  what about the hardworking british criminal ? 
  except of course for british pensioners in spain or british hotel/b & b owners in britain . 
  i think there was a rash of eastern-european gangs committing burglaries . 
  why are you so hung up on the european parliament president anyway ? 
  its not like he has any extraordinary power . 
  so you voted for somebody who votes for european parliament president , you just ca n't be bothered to look up how the eu works . 
  so what you are really saying is , `` i do n't bother to vote for the european parliament so its undemocratic '' . 
  well ... that 's not how democracy works . 
  because as i understand it , the british population , or at least a majority , do n't like him . 
  him supporting stay creates an unconscious link of unlike-ability . 
  yea i 'm not buying it . 
  i think it has been one long campaign of reverse psychology . 
  you 'd almost think that cameron is playing a double bluff and actually * wants * a brexit . 
  your issue should be with the black market employers really . 
  so the british suggest it and then blame germany ? 
   when you have members of x , y and z populations committing the majority of crimes , then you should have a more cautious attitude towards said members . 
  * relatively , statistically . 
   facial expression probably has an influence too . 
  does resting bitch face count ? 
  the reason for this poll by the way is because a rapper and soccer player were recently in the news because they both complained they regularly get `` randomly checked . 
  in the case of the rapper the police officer in question admitted to him it was because car + ethnicity = check it . 
  [ he was fun though .

  considering the consequences of being on a sex offenders list in the us being in jail might just be preferable . 
  point is , lots of countries have insane laws . 
  hell indonesia will execute you for selling drugs while at the same time half the adult male population are pretty much chain smokers . 
  so basically your defense is , the french guys scared the brits so the brits are justified in throwing a chair . 
  so you are telling me the british guy got off his chair , picked it up and started throwing it in the about 0.2 seconds he had while the french guy was making the throwing motion ? 
  0:30 , set playback speed to 0.25 , you can clearly see the chair enters the frame already airborne before the french guy can finish throwing the bottle . 
  he is in prison you dolt . 
   friends of the woman in question claim that she lied to them about her holiday destination , she allegedly told them she was going to france . 
   the man in question claims that the sex was voluntary and that he paid her for it . 
   british fans enjoying themselves and french thugs showing up to throw a bottle , then the police tear gas the british fans . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyoty58fhoi chair starts flying before the bottle , police show up in a minute and tear gas french hooligans , not the brits . 
  because i was posting something negative about her . 
  [ thematically on point song to listen to while reading .

  what the other guy said , slow the video down to 0.25 . 
  one might infer that this comment is joking but thanks to this brilliant cartoonist i know that if / u/gerrit8500 was joking he would label his comment with an / s, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyoty58fhoi chair starts flying before the bottle . 
  looks to me like the chair was already being thrown by the time the french guy started throwing his bottle ... 
  arrest : 14th dutch ministry of foreign affairs was notified : 16th embassy official visited : 20th official meeting with embassy official present on monday, 
  i mean ... there are a number of us states which will put you on a sex offenders list for public urination . 
  no , that 's you making a scene about a sentence which could possibly use an extra comma . 
  artist is a trump supporter , not surprising . 
  you might want to get your eyes checked , those daisies look suspiciously like lawn chairs . 
  i literally just relayed what was in the article ... 
  bit of an update on the case : arrest : 14th dutch ministry of foreign affairs was notified : 16th embassy official visited : 20th the woman according to the dutch embassy ignored suggestions for a lawyer . 
  friends of the woman in question claim that she lied to them about her holiday destination , she allegedly told them she was going to france . 
  the man in question claims that the sex was voluntary and that he paid her for it . 
  she claims that she was drugged and raped and subsequently arrested when she went to the police . 
  the ministry of foreign affairs has said that there are no formal criminal charges as of yet . 
  apparently the first official meeting on the case will be on monday and an embassy official will be present .

  nope , the french need to feel relevant . 
  have you ever considered that maybe your beef should be with the many businesses hiring from eastern-europe ? 
  or for that matter , the customers who do n't want to pay ( enough ) for british employee 's . 
  space colonization , electric cars and faster cross nation public transport ( hyperloop ) will certainly help with that . 
  eu parties are just your ideologically related national parties united in one block ... you have your christian conservatives , your business liberals , your green/environment related party , hell there 's even a european party for separatist/independence parties . 
  and naturally the best way to save money is to cut something which just so happens to be connected to a hot button political issue but wont actually save all that much money . 
  totally worth dozens of high level meetings , damaged relations and hundreds if not thousands of civil servant man hours in both countries . 
  the government using eu money or the eu using eu money ? 
  there is a difference . 
  also , source ? 
  at least not until they have to wait several hours at every border crossing should the eu disintegrate after brexit . 
   david cameron 's rebate did much to publicise the issue of child benefit payments to eu migrants , a fact that few people in the uk were even aware of . 
  14 per cent of people now think that 30 per cent of the uk 's child benefit budget is sent to children living overseas . 
  23 per cent of people think that 13 per cent of it does . 
  the correct figure is 0.3 per cent . 
  it means that almost 49 per cent of the population overestimate the figure by more than 40 times . 
  we have a similar issue in the netherlands . 
  we have a treaty with morocco from 1972 that roughly says that children/spouses living in morocco of moroccan 's who work/have worked in the netherlands can get benefits ( depending on conditions ) . 
  this is from the days when we imported tens of thousands of them as cheap labor . 
  now , listening to the right one would think this costs us unimaginable amounts of money each year when in reality its ... about 15 million euro 's and expected to rise up to about 25 million euro 's in the next 10 years or so . 
  the right would like to completely cancel the treaty while conveniently ignoring that most of these are earned benefits . 
  who ... built/designed those rockets ? 
   or the fact that they were transporting people some months ago with industrial speed to central europe from greece . 
  who exactly ? 
  which eu officials or agencies were involved in these transports ? 
  all i remember is a number of eastern-european countries working as hard as they could to dump the problem on the other side of the border . 
  * in certain ways, 
   reforms for shortening lines . 
  this always strikes me as somewhat absurd . 
  either there is a line because of needless paperwork or there is a line because there are too few surgeons/too many customers . 
  the first one is easily fixable , the other clearly is not . 
  the only thing `` reform '' is usually likely to do is restrict the number of customers who can afford/are allowed to have surgery just so the relevant politicians can say , `` see , no more waiting !, 
  i think its damn important for the millions of british pensioners living in continental europe .
