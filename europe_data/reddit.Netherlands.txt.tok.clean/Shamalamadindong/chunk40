  not to mention that a fair number of coastal countries already have a refugee problem . 
  that leaves you with islands which would likely require a massive construction project and pretty insane logistics to make it habitable for large numbers of people . 
  tl ; dr stupid idea 4 years ago , stupid idea 2 years ago , stupid idea 6 months ago , stupid idea today . 
   some people on the left just ca n't comprehend economic realities . 
  like the abolition of human labor ? 
  newspapers or tabloids ? 
  from a distance they look just like british tabloids to me . 
  i propose a referendum to * kick * britain out . 
  so be wary of any man with more than 2 days worth of baguette 's because hes likely to use the leftover one to club you over the head ? 
  [ its a pun on this article about watered down antibiotics . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21699880-romanias-latest-scandal-features-watered-down-disinfectant-hospitals-death-antiseptic ), 
  what is it this time ? 
  watered down fuel ? 
  communist basically . 
  without the religious persecution and executions . 
  not on a new years eve , in the middle of the day , with a couple hundred witnesses and police present . 
   and in the end it was bs since the guy driving was a muslim immigrant * not an immigrant as far as i know . 
   in london i can take you to areas where you would be pretty much the only non muslim or the only brit , or the only poor/rich person , or the only black person , or the only white person , or the only non-asian person , etc , etc , etc. ... 
  rule34 does n't apply in this case i think . 
   heck it took 4 days for the cologne attacks to go mainstream lets casually ignore that it was new years eve and a weekend ... 
   i do n't think there was any significant groping * that anyone remembered anyway . 
  yes . 
  1279 upvotes and 9000 + comments but everyone is trying to sweep it under the rug . 
  maybe uber and especially airbnb could start actually following the rules ? 
  i do n't mind anyone renting out a spare room or their apartment while they are away but there has been an explosion of people who just stuff an apartment full of bunk beds and rent them all out . 
  doing so fucks up both the local market for normal renters and drastically increases the number of beds available for tourists which causes a city to get overwhelmed with them . 
  nah it * used * to be eastern-europeans but voters happen to dislike muslims more at the moment so now the bigger problem is muslims . 
   iirc - sizable minorities of irish were not raping people in the streets . 
  nor were the irish unwilling to associate with the rest of their new country whilst demanding special privileges , jobs , healthcare , and housing . 
  ah yes . 
  revisionist immigration history is always a fun one . 
  large groups of immigrants * always * get treated like shit . 
  hell at one point america was totally in agreement that irish immigration was a papist invasion . 
  look up the situation in eastern turkey , its basically civil war between the turkish govt and the kurds . 
  its not like they actually pay taxes though . 
  implying americans would have shot them or something ? 
  i do n't really get your point tbh . 
  sorta what happens when instead of leveling legitimate criticism you paint 1-2 million refugees all as sex maniacs who constantly go around raping people . 
  not the above comment mind you , the writer of this article evidently knows the difference between demonizing and legitimate criticism . 
  indeed it is . 
  how many pakistani 's are there in germany ? 
  how many have at some point been accused/convicted of sexual assault and/or rape ? 
  the discussion can continue after we have these numbers . 
  and how many did n't report or were too drunk to remember they were assaulted by a native german ? 
  point is , you are speculating an unknown . 
   why would you want to have them serve jail time in what is not their home country ? 
  why would you want them to walk free ? 
  photo suggest an open air festival with plenty of light ... 
  were you there ? 
  then your entire comment is conjecture . 
  so why are they only looking at 6 suspects ? 
  also , were you there ? 
  then your entire comment is conjecture . 
  so ... middle of a crowd of people and nobody reacted ? 
  did anything ? 
  at all ? 
  there 's something going on with your account , i 'm getting post notifications hours after you post . 
  and i meant this comment thread , not the entire topic . 
   which is why they are n't qualified . 
  which again , is an assumption . 
  fyi , as far as i can tell dutchnews.nl basically exists solely to post translated articles on reddit . 
  edit : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4lu5fx/dutch_social_assistance_grows_in_first_quarter/ increase of 11.000 recipients in first quarter of 2016 . 
  15.000 total in 2015 . 
   those people have been in the workforce and are constantly learning as they work . 
  they 're qualified through experience . 
  and  those immigrants are n't perfectly capable of job x. 
  that 's the point . 
  simply having a degree does n't make you qualified . 
  are a bit contradictory are n't they ? 
  edit :  no one wants to hire someone who is n't going to be * able to get the job done * . 
  that was the assumption part . 
  not the same thing . 
   no one wants to hire someone who is n't going to be able to get the job done . 
  assumption . 
  besides , there are plenty of `` western '' degrees whose standards 30 years ago should disqualify a person with said degree today . 
  point is , you may have plenty of immigrants who are perfectly capable of job x but are n't allowed to do job x because their degree is n't considered valid . 
  * title  please elaborate . 
  i clearly linked it . . 
  or lack of valid ( recognized ) qualifications . 
   any hidden motives of xenophobia or whatnot are fueled by nothing but your own paranoia . 
  or alternatively , by the anti-immigrant circlejerk going on in the comments . 
   you said that only 15000 were ` allowed ' to work below . 
  this is not true , as the article states that one third of the workers were actually allowed to work ( which would be at least 50 thousand ) going off the number the other guy posted . 
  do yourself a favor and go down the comment chain before you make a stupid reply . 
  why ? 
  why did i only just get a notification for this post ? 
  weird . 
  anyway look at the other replies in this thread . 
  `` 162.000 came to sweden , [ 15.000 are allowed to work ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4luliz/162000_came_to_sweden_500_got_a_job_translation/d3qemgc ) , 500 got/found a job . '', 
  point is , the 162.000 number is bait . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4luliz/162000_came_to_sweden_500_got_a_job_translation/d3qemgc so the number suddenly goes down from 162.000 to 15.000 . 
  take in to account that nobody is going to hire 50 + year olds and the number becomes even smaller . 
  `` dirty foreigners mooching of our hard earned tax dollars '' . 
  when the title implies something which the article does n't substantiates it is clickbait . 
  my this thread is just full of self-important assholes today . 
  i know . 
  still clickbait . 
  clickbait much ? 
  edit : do yourself a favor and go down the comment chain before you make a stupid reply . 
   then how come turkey has been declared safe for all the syrians and other refugees that have been crossing the aegean ?
