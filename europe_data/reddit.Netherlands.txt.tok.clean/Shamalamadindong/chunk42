  just takes a couple of good torpedo hits ... or in the case of a tussle with china/russia a small tactical nuke . 
  would n't surprise me if it turns out to just be dumb bad luck . 
  fyi , its looking more like this was a rival criminal calling in a terrorist tip on his competition . 
   slamic extremists are planning a tunisia-style massacre of tourists involving bombs placed under sunbeds , according to a german newspaper report citing italian security sources . 
   german newspaper bild reports that the jihadists planned to conceal themselves in tourist resorts posing as refreshment vendors . 
  this is a pilot for a new comedy show is n't it ? 
  maybe an american should n't be getting mixed up in a discussion about british prison problems ... 
  and the righties are probably screaming something about taqiyya . 
  or expected . 
  after my grandparents got married the local priest came and visited every week asking if they had made a baby yet !,

  because regardless of financial situation a lot of people these days really do n't want kids . 
  let me guess ? 
  somebody accidentally left their lunchbox ? 
  keep in mind this likely ranges anywhere from drunk hooligan with a knife to drunk trash resisting arrest after a night out boozing edit : point is , no us style drive-by shit, 
  one can be very smart and very stupid at the same time . 
  feel free to write a letter to your relevant government representative or elected official . 
   i responded to this post in length but it has been shadow-deleted nope . 
   you do n't even consider the possibility that there are tons of people legitimately concerned for the effects of fundamentalist islam . 
  here and there . 
  noooo , they 're all just closet racists to you . 
  oh they certainly exist . 
  they have a bad habit of following/supporting the racist fucknuts though . 
  you think wilders cares if refugees are muslim or christian ? 
  arab or kurd or druze ?

  or maybe its a holiday in the netherlands and i 'm sleeping in . 
  the populist `` righty '' . 
   whataboutism , really . 
  incorrect . 
  i 'm pointing out the irony in a righty saying `` poor persecuted minorities and normal muslims '' while he in reality would love nothing more than to deport them all . 
  throw out the baby with the bathwater . 
  throw out the entire bowl of fruit because of one bad apple . 
  even more so by the ultra-righty `` deport them all '' motherfuckers ... 
  ass it is . 
  even the daily mail would n't print this garbage ... 
   here is a criminal but we will blur his face in case you may recognise him . 
  or alternatively , police are paranoid and this was just a dickhead driving on the sidewalk . 
  yes . 
   these people statistically commit way more crime statistically , most of the time when somebody says `` statistically '' without actually linking to a source they are talking out of their ass . 
   however , i do not like seeing `` refugees '' just hanging around malls you assume they are allowed to do anything other than hang around . 
  i assume most are not yet in a position where they are legally allowed to work . 
   surfing on their smartphones . 
  and ? 
  they did n't come out of the stone age , they have had smartphones for quite a while . 
  it really does n't with this sort of stuff . 
  schooling has a tangible benefit . 
  an imagined `` leg up '' does n't . 
  the next client down the line does n't give a shit and also wants you to do it for exposure . 
   i mean to someone trying to enter the design industry , it is a leg up what is that ? 
  can you eat it ? 
  does it pay rent ?

  resource issues are a distribution problem though , not availability . 
  so you put a couple billion in to desalination plants and building decent plumbing . 
  same with greece until halfway last year . 
  why a cemetery ? 
   lets just say those who do n't want to work under certain conditions that might violate their religion might find that there is little work available ... 
  there 's a niche for everything though . 
  funny thing is , this is about four times the money the yearly cost would be to take care of * all * refugees in the region itself . 
  but we could n't be bothered 4-5 years ago to start spending that kind of cash to keep the problem over there so the problem naturally moved itself over here . 
  no more russians in cs : go ? 
  this is probably my age showing but i ca n't think of anything decent from the last couple of years . 
  instead have some dutch classics .

  if you want an instant revolution ... greece still has violent anarchists you know . 
  except they were n't refugees but whatever , facts right ? 
   if erdogan wont be reasonable turkey : 2.5-3 million refugees on a population of 76 million . 
  europe : 1 million-ish refugees on a population of 508 million . 
  i still struggle to see how turkey is the unreasonable one when europe is screaming bloody murder because of a population increase of 0.2 %, 
  and they would be right to do so . 
  various eu member states are trying their best to blow up the deal with entirely unrelated complaints . 
  same with the labour party in the netherlands , they made an unholy alliance with our version of the tory 's and have lost more than half their seats in the polls because of it . 
  and how many racist attacks hmmm ? 
   but yeah , we do accept refugees that come from ukraine for example . 
  nope . 
   expect hundred thousands ukrainians .

  no , he means member state representatives who push for something eu wide and then go back home to bitch about how the eu is forcing them to do that thing . 
  from wikipedia ,  the mejlis of the crimean tatar people is the single highest executive-representative body of the crimean tatars in period between sessions of the qurultay ( congress ) of the crimean tatar people . 
   the body was labeled an `` extremist organisation '' and subsequently banned by crimea 's supreme court on 26 april 2016 .

  which means rooting your phone , which is a step too far for most people . 
  i 'd honestly like to see some data on how many people they supposedly `` catch '' with this sort of stuff . 
  wiping your phone and laptop and restoring them after you get in is relatively trivial . 
  well budapest is n't a london , new york or tokyo ... 
  the solution obviously is n't to prematurely punch everyone who might punch you in the face ...
