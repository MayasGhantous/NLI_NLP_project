  bingo , the nhs would collapse if it were to rely solely on native brits . 
  the first country the eu in some form had an association agreement with was turkey ... just saying . 
   wilders has a problem with certain questionable aspects of islam teachings . 
  and banning a book and closing down every single house of worship related to islam is certainly an appropriate way of showing his concern ... / s not to mention wanting to deport anyone from a muslim country with a valid but temporary visa . 
   arguing indeed becomes like nailing a pudding to the wall . 
  stealing this . 
   i thought the one thing we 've learned from 2016 is that calling people racist will just make them want to vote against you more ? 
  `` this is why trump won '' should be meme of the year at this point . 
  it is somewhat ironic considering the trumpsters and wilders voters will be first in line to say their guy `` tells the truth '' yet when the other side `` tells the truth '' they clamor for their safe space . 
  technically trump is an american wilders . 
  that statement is either willful ignorance or simple stupidity . 
  you can be a racist but at least have the decency to not pull statistics out of your ass . 
   wilders himself said this in an interview . 
  he does n't have a problem with muslims at all . 
  `` i do n't have a problem with muslims i just want to ban everything and anything to do with them '', 
  there is an extremely simple way of testing if what somebody says is bad . 
  simply replace the person or group they are speaking about with jew/jews . 
   wilders asked a roomful of supporters if they wanted to have `` more or fewer ~ ~ moroccans ~ ~ jews '' in the country . 
  when the crowd shouted back `` fewer ! '' , he replied : `` well , we 'll take care of that . '' see . 
   just for the record , removing ethnic minority does n't necessarily imply this would be accomplished with gas chambers . 
  i 'd remind you that the nazi 's started out with simple deportation to palestine . 
   and so does the uk so if russia were to attack we 'd be covered . 
  the uk would likely be content to just sit behind its channel . 
   britain is already taking syrian refugees - but we 're doing it properly . 
  only a handful though , in the big scheme of things . 
  edit : 3000 through your own scheme and 20.000 through the unhcr . 
  and ? 
   merkel caused the migrant crisis yes , she is entirely to blame for : - decades of upheaval in the middle-east and africa - the iraq war ( which is partly to blame for the syrian situation ) - dictators in the middle-east and africa - a collective refusal of the eu member nations to work together on this issue since late 2014, 
   what i know most danes would be more than glad to do , is financially support countries that are willing to host refugee camps . 
  well ... get on it ? 
  lebanon and jordan could do with more funding . 
   greece , italy , etc. , on the other hand , ought to do more to control the flow of illegal immigrants and/or send them back . 
  one can not build a wall in the aegean or mediterranean ... 
  * and only applied to december of 2015, 
   the original source is frans timmermans when he said it i knew it would be repeated for years to come ... tl ; dr he pulled the number out of his ass the `` 60 % '' came from an unfinished frontex report and is only correct if one assumes * only * syrians are legit refugees . 
  throw this article in a translator , http://www.ad.nl/buitenland/timmermans-goochelt-met-aantallen-vluchtelingen~ad541565/, 
  funny thing is , i read that in the voice of billy connolly . 
  citation needed on the 60 %, 
  its 2016 , trump is president , shia labeouf is in a rap beef with soulja boy , anything is possible . 
  he 's made many . 
  cold ? 
  nordics ? 
  [ obligatory apetor video !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/yxa9o2ww138 ), 
  donbass , crimea , abkhazia , south-ossetia , these are just picknicks by glorious russian army . 
   `` germany has only taken 20 migrants !, 
  what solidarity ? 
  it is intellectually dishonest to make the argument germany does n't do enough . 
   or it can not be legally proved ? 
  much less identify more than a handful of perps . 
   so it did n't happen ? 
  honestly in this day and age lack of video would almost make one think that . 
   photos and videos of the `` events '' ? 
  have you seen any ? 
  i 've seen maybe one or two short clips , shaky and low quality . 
   tens of witnesses ? 
  notoriously unreliable . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but i do n't think the nye perps left ip addresses linked to a bill linked to a home address . 
  did n't this get posted a couple of days ago ? 
  misogynist bastards . 
  / s but not / s, 
  funny enough britain is actually the most active proponent of turkey joining the eu . 
  money opens all doors . 
  alternatively , maybe you should brush up on your reading comprehension . 
  except in this case heinrich happens to be one of the most common first names in the world . 
  nope , they would n't be an island anymore . 
  the british psyche could never accept that . 
  i 'd be fine with that provided they register themselves as temporary accommodation and pay whatever fees , licenses and taxes that entails . 
  airbnb sucks up what would normally be normal housing for people who you know ... actually want to live there . 
  and turns it in to temporary living space for ( in our case ) drunk brits . 
  renting out a spare room so you can afford the rent on your apartment , fine . 
  but that is n't the case with airbnb . 
  it decreases the amount of available long term living space . 
   why do we need to make regulation to keep houses empty ? 
  if a house is empty in the netherlands it 's because the owner wants it to be . 
  we have had a housing shortage since forever . 
  context , https://np.reddit.com/r/airbnb/comments/6snknl/city_maps_for_european_airbnb_location_ratings/ airbnb is driving up rents all over europe 's major cities, 
  the problem is n't second hand renting . 
  the problem is building owners who chop up the entire building in to airbnb rooms . 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/airbnb/comments/6snknl/city_maps_for_european_airbnb_location_ratings/ you can map out major european cities by listings ... 
  drunk brits . 
  there i said it . 
  actually , brexit wont be so bad if it results in a decrease of drunk brits . 
  i 'm not entirely awake yet but considering they ca n't even name any specific instances of support for half the people mentioned i 'm calling this sensationalist bullshit . 
  except it was by pretty much every measure compared to the previous governments . 
  perhaps . 
  but maduro is a fool , chavez was not . 
  it 's equally likely he could have held things together . 
  would n't that make trump nero ? 
   you ca n't let a place out on airbnb for more than 60 days a year in amsterdam . 
  in theory . 
  airbnb . 
  what used to be restricted to actual hotels now plays out on the porches and in hallways where people actually live . 
  imagine you live in an apartment and every few days you have different drunk brits as your neighbors . 
  the best defense against pretty much anything is always to run away ... 
   probably making empty promises ironic when you then link to a website that 's just as empty as your average politician . 
  because the pc excuse is a coverup for incompetence . 
  and then eastern ukraine , and a bit of poland until eventually ... https://youtu.be/yfnrlveh7ok?t=21s, 
   how ~ ~ german ~ ~ capitalism really works \\ corrected . 
  and here ladies and gentlemen we have exhibit a in why americans are fat .
