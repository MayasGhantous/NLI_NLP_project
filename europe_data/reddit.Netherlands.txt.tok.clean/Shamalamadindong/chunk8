  anyone have any numbers on this either way ? 
   blair fucked us on that , he said the poles and others would n't come to britain in large numbers . 
  this is why they did n't put in place transitional controls like most counties did . 
  of course they were ridiculously wrong . 
  probably could n't run the country without them these days though . 
  any medical people or nuclear experts here who can tell us if these actually you know . . help ? 
   i do n't think he 's that far off base . 
  russia is n't a threat to most of western europe . 
  well you do n't see zimbabwean or eritrean aircraft poking our borders . 
   there 's a difference between holding everyone accountable and not using our intelligence to better identify the issue . 
  that 's a bit ironic to say considering the situation is n't it ? 
  i think i can confidently speak for a sizable portion of the dutch public when i say `` fuck off '' . 
   who is the mentor of osama and why is it bad he was invited ? 
  wikipedia does n't mention that first one which would sorta negate the second thing . 
  as far as conservative muslim clerics go he seems pretty reasonable . 
   i 'm starting to hate the environment because of them . 
  well clearly their dastardly plan is working . 
   construction in area c is illegal if israel does not give its consent . 
  which it coincidentally rarely if ever does ... 
   and they sure as hell are n't getting zoning permissions from the only internationally recognized entity that can grant permissions in that territory , the israeli civil administration . 
  could have something to do with said civil administration hardly ever granting said permits for non-israeli 's . 
  [ this guy ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salman_al-ouda#the_message_to_osama_bin_laden ), 
   technically , israel had conquered that land . 
  does n't work that way anymore after wwii . 
  that 's the joke . 
  which would be an entirely valid complaint if this was a simple case of every refugee in bulgaria getting 500 euro cash in hand every month , but we all know it is n't . 
  its far more likely most of the money ends up in the hands of some business owner who is tasked by the government to provide food and shelter for migrants ( and has a familial connection to somebody in the relevant government department ) . 
  from wikipedia ...  according to the 2011 hungarian census , there were 5,579 muslims in hungary , made up 0.056 % of the total population . 
  of these , 4,097 ( 73.4 % ) declared themselves as hungarian , while 2,369 ( 42.5 % ) as arab by ethnicity . 
  [ 11 ] in hungary people can declare more than one ethnicity ( sum is greater than the whole ) , [ 12 ] so some people declared hungarian and arab together . 
  even if we assume the number has quadrupled since 2011 its still a ridiculous thing to be talking about , go worry yourself about some real problems . 
  hell there are more jews than muslims in hungary . 
   earlier pro-leave justice secretary michael gove warned that five potential new members of the eu - macedonia , montenegro , serbia , albania and turkey - would result in millions more people having the right to move to the uk . 
  turkey has pretty much wanted to join the club for 50 years and the rest of them are at least ten years away and in the case of macedonia probably longer considering the possibly impending revolution .

  do you want non-brits to respond ? 
  if not , delete this post and repost it in a british related subreddit . 
  not nearly as crazy as 1.5 ish million on a population of 4-5 million . 
   i think the refugees will be happier in turkey than in eu , because they share the same religion and most were part of the ottoman empire as well why do people keep spouting this nonsense ? 
  the religion part i can sorta get but why dig up the decrepit old corpse of the ottoman empire as proof that refugees might like to be in turkey ? 
  implying that immigrants do n't struggle under the same monolithic bureaucracy and the exaggerated taxation ? 
  apparently i 'm blind :p, 
  ~ ~ how ? 
  the article completely fails to mention who , what , when and where . ~ ~ ~ ~ did they know which school ? 
  was there an actual attack being planned ? 
  did they arrest people ? 
  at what stage was their preparation ? ~ ~ apparently i 'm blind :p, 
  you know what is really funny ? 
  in dutch `` je '' after a word is usually used as a way of implying its a small version . 
  boom = tree boompje = small tree, 
  one of the 3 women is latvian ... 
  `` i stubbed my toe , damn you soros ! '', 
  lets skip that interim state and lets move right on to spanish or mandarin . 
  small problem , that one was an actual civil war . 
   would n't ending the war etc be a more pressing issue ? 
  how exactly ? 
  outright trashing the treaty is hardly respecting our partners . 
   i doubt the netherlands has put thousands of people to work for this treaty . 
  that 's the point . 
  this is n't a dutch treaty , its a european one . 
   there are ways to respect the outcome , and also respect our partners . 
  and in your mind that way is to just trash years and years of negotiations and the work of thousands of people ? 
  thing is , its not exactly a prestigious position , its a career dead end , nobody will ever go from housing minister to pm . 
  thus you only get the ones who the party wants to dump or unenthusiastic retirees who do n't give a damn . 
  i love how it gets reposted here a day after it got debunked as a wonky translation in r/worldnews https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4fgtmv/swedens_deputy_leader_just_defended_the_911/?sort=top, 
   but giving out free visas is both a distortion of the job market and an invitation for further islamic colonisation . 
  and you sounded so reasonable up until that ...  just so we all know what we 're talking about maybe you should look up what kind of visa 's we are talking about here ... 
  which is all fine and good but does it apply here ? 
  * not actually the founder . 
  [ turns out the real founder is a former stasi spy . 
  step 2.5 realize that these are not work visa 's . 
   and if they 're in their 20s are you advocating for child labor ? 
  netherlands here , we have a lilly white 100 % european christian housing minister here , he does n't care . 
  i do n't know , more importantly , are they lead by a convicted terrorist ? 
  so what hes essentially saying is that he applauds a foreign cult coming in , brainwashing the king and the king subsequently ordering everyone to convert . 
  no dancing , cheering 2 . 
  not directly after the bombing, 
  would agricultural communes of sorts have been an option ? 
  i would imagine that at that time many of the immigrants/refugees would have been farmers back home . 
  either your french or your reading comprehension is failing you , the article specifically mentions 80 % in a ** specific area ** of molenbeek . 
  google translate :  the town ( 95,000 inhabitants ) lives halved . 
  to the west of the railway , residential quarters , out buildings to land in the 50s and 60s age , baby boomers mostly `` belgo-belgian '' , they impoverish . 
  to the east of the railway , is another molenbeek , young , lively , to the tunes of a large village . 
  the moroccan population is around 80 % . 
  this is the `` eastern neighborhood '' , in the words qu'utilisait philippe moureaux . 
  `` that becomes the center of a small molenbeek marrakech , why not ? 
  the problem is that it turns into peshawar , '' had replied , in 2009 the liberal fran\u00e7oise schepmans now mayor . 
  [ from the wikipedia article , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sint-jans-molenbeek#21st_century )  the population has been described as `` mainly muslim '' in the media ; [ 9 ] however , actual figures range between 25 % and 40 % , depending on the catchment area . 
  the population of molenbeek itself , while already impoverished and overcrowded , has further increased by 24.5 % in the last decade . 
  [ 13 ] [ the article wikipedia references is unfortunately behind a paywall . 
   her line about genocide completely eludes me . 
  what does she mean ? 
  is it about the armenian genocide , if so yes , erdogan denies it was a genocide , as has every other turkish leader before him and as will many other turkish leaders after him . 
  valid criticism from that perspective , but it 's not erdogan exclusive . 
  artistic freedom to make it rime i think . 
  ironically i remember reading that that caused problems with previous waves because they housed them in rural areas with relatively high unemployment . 
   and not all part-timers are pleased with their set up : before the financial crisis , fewer than 10 % of dutch part-timers wished they were employed full time ; this has risen to nearly 25 % . 
  this percentage is still much lower than in other eu countries , but it is a striking rise . 
  partially because employers are starting to abuse part time and zzp as a way of underpaying people .
