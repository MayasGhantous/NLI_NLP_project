and americans are wondering why the eu ca n't become one nation . 
  that 's only $ 102 million a plane . 
  it 's a steal !, 
  not so much the shipping business : they where 9 % short . 
  i do n't think any business would accept a 9 % offset from their requirements . 
  we are too flat for hydropower , not enough sun for a lot of solar power and not enough space for wind power . 
  how on earth are we getting ` green ' energy if we do n't buy it from norway ? 
  that 's why the companies that generate power and companies who maintain the network need to be divided . 
  in the netherlands you pay a flat fee to be connected to the network , on top of any power you use . 
  is that why alaska is scoring so high ? 
  because in the summer there is ( nearly ) 24 hours of sun ? 
  i also have a robot that ( sort of ) vacuums the floor once a day . 
  it seems allright , however the merkelreich seems attractive too !, 
  really , people expect serious now that i 'm typing everything twice ? 
  i just throw it in the machine translation . 
  not anymore !, 
  you now are allowed to laugh without exposing your teeth ( glimlachen ) . 
  did n't you get the memo ? 
  the uk is the 51st state of the usa !, 
  did you include those on the bottom of the canals ? 
  guess you are a student , using your government funded chip card . 
  as soon that ends you 'll find out that a car is both cheaper and more convenient than bike and train . 
  so , how you like them apples ? 
  the dutch have the biggest gas supply of europe . 
  we are n't depending on anyone 's gas at all . 
  i ca n't talk about other countries , but in the netherlands we are kinda concerned about the stress immigrants put on our social system . 
  because of this we only tend to accept people who are in dire need of help ( because of war in their own country , running from corrupt government , that kind of stuff ) . 
  refugees just seeking opportunity in europe / netherlands are denied unless they can prove they are an asset to the society . 
  just coming from a poor country does n't cut it . 
  yes that . 
  `` i put a farting bag on obama 's chair '', 
  the berlin wall was just one part of the [ iron curtain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_curtain ) . 
  while the wall was the only physical wall of it , the ussr was n't really doing the open borders thingy . 
  ... when an eight year old triggers it . 
  yes . 
  before the city decided that we needed roundabouts we had a green wave system . 
  it worked perfectly and no one was complaining about that . 
  now we have roundabouts and all they do is slow down traffic , exept they are turbo roundabouts . 
  people just take the middle lane since then you hardly have to slow down and now we have more accidents . 
  so yes , i hate those roundabouts . 
  i hate them . 
  on my daily commute i encounter too many of them . 
  you only did this so you could switch places with the dutch ... 
  that 's probably because op is from sweden . 
  i think the website just checks for your geo-ip thingy and lists your country as 5th on the list if you 're not in the top 4 . 
  in the official rankings they cut out at 5th . 
  it hurts :(, 
  as someone who visits / r/depression sometimes it just disheartened me how some people do n't visit a psychiatrist because it costs too much money . 
  when i was depressed i did n't even consider `` costs '' . 
  i just went , got medicine and spend about 1,5 hours a week at a psychiatrist . 
  costs ? 
  my $ 350 `` own risk '' part . 
  ( what is tax deduct able ), 
  that 's only 15 years of health insurance !, 
  and there i am , thinking $ 110 a month is to much money for proper health care . 
  white on blue for all car roads , red on white for bicycle roads . 
  i do n't think we use any other colours . 
  we 're not at war , we 're just not talking to a few countries !, 
  we might also be very interested in the fruit : `` sinaasappels '', 
  there would be wat alright , how would you feel if another country would wreck your economy ? 
  it has been reverted since people started selling and smoking on the streets again . 
  as if no one saw that coming . 
  fun fact !, 
  bl\u00f6t sounds the same as the dutch `` blut '' what means `` out of money '' . 
  i do n't believe this map . 
  i think the dutch would just increase our dikes and do n't shrink any land at all . 
  i too have seen geordie shore . 
  wow !, 
  not only does europe face a global wine shortage , the whole world does !, 
  the biggest point i think is that data from european civilians ca n't leave european soil unless they are stored in a country that has the same or more strict data protection laws . 
  the european law includes that data may not be prossesed more than necessary , the owner of the data ( you and me , not facebook and google ) must be notified if someone gets to see the data and [ some more here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/data_protection_directive ) . 
  save harbour is basically a free pass for the usa as they do n't have the strict data laws ( cough patriot act cough ) but still get access . 
  it made sense if you think about how much software companies are in america , but right now with the nsa actions and such , not so much anymore . 
  yes , last year they did . 
  the actor playing coole piet diego has issues about the fact that he ca n't be coole piet diego when he 's not playing in the tv-series or movies from `` de club van sinterklaas '' . 
  he already left once when the show was owned by netflix , then returned as rtl4 took the show over but left shortly after . 
  source : [ wikipedia ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/diego_%28zwarte_piet%29 ), 
  the presents !, 
  i mean , you do n't want an electrical train that does n't work right ? 
  so she tests every single present before its wrapped . 
  ^ ^ ^ best ^ ^ ^ job ^ ^ ^ ever . 
  in reality , there are [ more than six to eight black men ] ( http://www.vanenter.nl/blog/images/_allegaar/sinterklaas_zwaaien.jpg ) . 
  some even have names : * [ hoge hoogte piet ( large heights piet ) ] ( http://www.declubvansinterklaas.nl/gfx/cast/hogehoogtepiet.png ) * [ prof piet ] ( http://www.declubvansinterklaas.nl/gfx/cast/profpiet.png ) * [ danspiet ( dance piet ) ] ( http://www.declubvansinterklaas.nl/gfx/cast/danspiet.png ) * [ keukenpiet ( kitchen piet ) ] ( http://www.declubvansinterklaas.nl/gfx/cast/keukenpiet.png ) * [ muziekpiet ( music piet ) ] ( http://www.declubvansinterklaas.nl/gfx/cast/muziekpiet.png ) * [ testpiet ] ( http://www.declubvansinterklaas.nl/gfx/cast/testpiet.png ) * [ coole piet ] ( http://www.declubvansinterklaas.nl/gfx/cast/coolepiet.png ) * [ ( retired ) wegwijspiet ( this one has a double meaning , as its both a familiarize piet , as the piet that shows the way ) ] ( http://www.sintforum.com/wiki/images/thumb/d/d3/wegwijs_michiel.png/250px-wegwijs_michiel.png ) * [ hulp piet ( assist piet ) ] ( http://www.sintforum.com/wiki/images/d/da/hulppiet.png ) * [ acrobaat piet ( acrobat piet ) , on the left ] ( https://www.onlineveilingmeester.nl/images/800x600/390/1a2330692be4cb79ba6d56001d131a9d.jpg ) * [ schilderpiet ( painter piet ) ] ( http://www.sintboz.nl/pietenfoto/schilderpiet.jpg ) * [ hoofd piet ( head / ` leader ' piet ) ] ( http://www.sintforum.nl/wiki/images/1/10/hoofdpiet_erik_muis.png ) * [ huispiet ( home/house piet ) ] ( http://www.sintforum.com/wiki/images/thumb/a/ae/huispiet_maarten.png/250px-huispiet_maarten.png ) * [ wellespiet ( no proper translation available ) ] ( http://www.sintforum.nl/wiki/images/thumb/1/1e/welles_dick.png/250px-welles_dick.png ) * [ pietje pecies ( also a nickname for perfectionists ) ] ( http://www.sintforum.nl/wiki/images/thumb/2/2a/pietje_precies_geert.png/250px-pietje_precies_geert.png ) ( now i ca n't be arsed to find pictures any more ) * rare piet ( strange piet ) * reservepiet * ballonnenpiet ( balloon piet ) * zorgpiet ( caretaker/nurse piet ) * computerpiet * pietje paniek ( panicking piet ) * vergeetpiet ( forget piet ) * strooipiet ( scatter piet ) * pietje verliefd ( in love piet ) * bootpiet ( boat piet ) * dichtpiet ( poem piet ) these are all the pieten my brother and i could think of . 
  most of them have starred in a tv-show and are known in all of holland ( and belgium ? ) . 
  all pieten have a name that either describes their task or their personality , so its quite easy to create a new piet if a writer desires one . 
  while in the western world this most likely is unnecessary , in some of the corrupted countries you 'll want a diplomat there for your citizens , without the chance that your diplomat gets arrested and jailed if the country does n't like you any more . 
  with the diplomat immunity they eliminated the chance of a show trial . 
  yeah i missed that xd, 
  he is from hungary ( bottom is green ) and i 'm from the netherlands ( bottom is ( cobalt - ) blue ) . 
  while in my case both french and german where mandatory , it is possible to drop one of them for an additional subject of choice . 
  everyone you spoke to for advise said to drop french , since you 'll encounter way more germans . 
  in some aspects we might just as well be the 17th bundesland . 
  nah , the oil is almost gone . 
  however , when you stand on the swedish coast you can see a pile of money . 
  that 's called norway . 
  til ; alt gr does the same as left control + left alt . 
  ( yes , i just spend a minute pressing alt gr + all keys on my keyboard to see what else was there until i noticed a pattern ), 
  do n't worry , they 're to old for you anyway . 
  if you read the article , you knew that prior ww2 spain used gmt but some political leader sucked up to hitler and changed it to cet / cest . 
  this causes their biological clock to be off and reduces productivity .
