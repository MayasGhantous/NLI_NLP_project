  if they revert back to gmt they hope to increase productivity and cause an economic boost . 
  i do n't care , i just feel good now . 
  except cows never participate in talent shows . 
  you know why ? 
  they 're afraid other cows will yell boe !, 
  yes , but shit is going to hit the fan too if you drive the car on the wrong side . 
  indeed it could . 
  for me it is cheaper and faster to just drive by car alone to my university than take the train . 
  funny thing : some religious people have stated that god has blessed them with the possibility of vaccinations . 
  refusing them would n't be right . 
  i 'm not going to deny racism in europe since it 's really there . 
  the main reason there is n't one europe yet and the eu is n't like the usa is because every country wants to preserve their identity . 
  even within europe there are a lot of stereotypes that lead to some kind of racism : the germans are efficient , the greek are lazy , poles are copper thefts , ukrainians are scammers , spain is poor , italy is corrupt and the uk is trying to screw us all . 
  each european county is so busy protecting their identity from european influences that we hate ( or at least dislike ) cultures who settle in our county without adapting to our own culture . 
  here in the netherlands we have a ` big ' problem with moroccans . 
  especially the younger moroccans do n't want to integrate into the dutch society and basically do not function in the society . 
  every single country in europe on their own is n't as multicultural as the usa is . 
  we do n't have problems with foreigners as long as they adapt to our society . 
  tl ; dr - europeans do n't have a problem with foreigners an sich , but because we want to protect our unique society we dislike people who try to insert their own culture into ours . 
  do n't forget [ de frikandel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frikandel ) and the [ real dutch kroket ( croquette ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croquette#netherlands ) . 
  all around the world you can get croquettes , but the real dutch one ( mmmm , van mora ) are the best . 
  i know rotterdam has lots of chemical and oil industries . 
  not exactly clean industries . 
  but they bring in lots of money so our government says we need to reduce the pollution of cars , since that 's easier to blame ( but harder to solve ) . 
  they should stop interviewing drunk and drugged people . 
  if you hear the dutch news it seems like our country is heading into a shithole of never return , but somehow we 're the 4th happiest country in the world . 
  ** netherlands ** * [ ziggo ] ( https://www.ziggo.nl/#producten/tv-internet/ ) * 60/6 * $ 48,95 * [ real speed right now , even though 2 smartphones and a playstation are also using this connection ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/2940225785.png ) this is including television ( 16 hd channels , 60 digital channels and 25 analogue channels ) . 
  they do n't sell without television . 
  we could have gone with fibre , but then the speed ( for a similar price ) would be 50/50 up to 60/60 , however we 'd then need a decoderbox for every tv as we would have lost the analogue cables . 
  our current tv has a build in decoder and we can use unlimited other tvs without any extra costs . 
  wow , you can also [ really see ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ysbqxkb.jpg?1 ) the [ fireworks disaster of 2000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enschede_fireworks_disaster ) on the map . 
  we do n't think we can , we know we can !, 
  see flevoland , large pieces of the rotterdam harbour and the foundation of the dubai palm islands !, 
  just throw money at it and we 'll create it !, 
  i was only joking xd, 
  oh , will you shut up ? 
  we all ready build a huge movable dike so your ships can pass trough and we 've done our part on the deepening . 
  we 're just trying to conserve the precious and unique ecosystem . 
  your competition to our large harbour has n't anything to do with it . 
  it 's wrong . 
  we do have holidays , but it depends on what zone ( north , middle , south ) you 're in when you have holidays . 
  but in general we have these holidays ( 2013/2014 ) : autumn : - north/middle : 19 - 27 october - south : 12 - 20 october christmas : - north/middle/south : 21 december - 5 january spring : - north : 22 february - 2 march - middle/south : 15 - 22 february may : - north/middle/south : 26 april - 5 may summer ( schools ) : - north : 5 july - 17 august - middle : 19 july - 31 august - south : 12 july - 24 august summer ( construction industry ) : - north : 21 july - 8 august - middle : 4 -22 august - south : 28 july - 15 august please note that most companies and higher levels of education skip the autumn and spring holidays . 
  also national holidays ( these count as a sunday , so you are free or paid at weekend rate ( if you have it ) ) : - 25-26 december ( christmas ) - 31 december - 1 january - 18 april ( good friday ) - 20 and 21 april ( easter ) - 26 april ( kings day ) - 5 may ( liberation day ) - 29 may ( ascension ) - 8-9 june ( pentecost ), 
  suck our dick eu !, 
  oh wait , you 're probably still waiting on your download speed !, 
  [ i had something like this in mind ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb7w9mjg0eo ), 
  next on my to do list : go bear searching with girls in bikini . 
  `` oh my god , it is a bear !, 
  we all have to take off one piece of clothing , i read it on the internet ! '', 
  just a small tip : what ever the fuck you do , do n't buy your trains from italy . 
  you 're welcome , holland and belgium . 
  no sorry , i meant i have all the coins that are in normal circulation . 
  i think i 'm also missing some of the ` one time only ' coins like the one for the dutch queens abdication ( was a 5 euro coin ) . 
  also i do n't go out if my way to collect them . 
  i just check my change and when i get a coin that looks unfamiliar i check with my collection . 
  i have yet to encounter a coin with the head of our new king on it , and belgium also has a new king so i 'm never done . 
  as a collector , i have all 8 coins from each country , but it seems i 've got some more collecting to do . 
  i do n't go out of my way to get them , i just check my change and put them away if i do n't have them yet . 
  and last night a thunderstorm travelled over the netherlands causing hardly no damage . 
  just the usual power outage if your house/street got struck . 
  and our chicken eggs are hatching . 
  that 's news too !, 
  but seriously ; absolutely nothing is happening here . 
  bring them to the netherlands , we 've got quite the experience with shipping people to the land of the `` free '' . 
  [ low rider ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xtgrfs5txm ), 
  can anyone explain what happened in the netherlands in 2010 . 
  before that it was following the normal rise in unemployment and after that it continues , but in 2010 the unemployment rate is steady . 
  i once told my dad i did n't like my bike anymore . 
  he looked at it , put some oil on the chain and i was stuck with it . 
  i also would n't dare to tell my dad i did n't like my 200k ferrari anymore . 
   dear netherlands , we are not the bad guys !, 
  let us just quickly burn all your fucking flowers that we bought to show you what we will do to you if you wo n't believe us . 
   kind regards , russia ftfy, 
  time to sink groningen to the bottom of the sea !, 
  and yet they try so hard to make it seem a german car . 
  on a dutch newssite they claim that the website is responsible because the comments are anonymous and the user who made the comment could not edit or remove said comment . 
  that 's why the website was responsible for ( removing ) the comments . 
  on a related note : we want our bikes back . 
  it actually did , but due to it 's giant gravity the time dilation is so large that it did n't affect you yet . 
  that 's why you soak it in a flammable liquid first . 
  wood you stop please ? 
  yes , its faster , cheaper and you 'll get fucked even more !, 
  while i agree pownet is the scum of the ( dutch ) journalist world , harassment is n't to be answered by violence . 
  they should just have called the police . 
  since the dutch state is required to protect the embassy employees and their family , this should be a high priority for the policy . 
  space : worlds best particle accelerator !, 
  turkey really hate the kurds so much that they would support isis fighting the kurds . 
  now russia is fighting isis and thus somewhat helping the kurds . 
  i would not be surprised if this is some bullshit coming from turkey 's side . 
  `` hey boss , there is this motoring show that want to borrow our newly designed bentley . 
  they said someone called ` captain slow ' is going to drive it and they have their own asphalt test track , is that al right ? '', 
  so yes , it is north of istanbul . 
  its actually a chineese knock off from fcuk . 
   only a combination of these in the right quantities will lead to the desired results . 
  so tonight we eat stamppot kroket !, 
  the other part is lots of kicks under the butt . 
  because those where the values that google 's first hit gave me , and i let wolfram alpha deal with unit conversion . 
   greece finished paying its debts , for some reason via several truck loads of 10 $ cent coins . 
  ok , so . 
  a truckload is about [ 44.000 lbs ] ( http://www.xtl.com/much-freight-fits-full-truckload/ ) and has a volume of about [ 122,2 ft ^ 3 ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=110inch+*48inch+*+40inch ) if we [ assume a 110 '' height truck ] ( http://www.directdrivelogistics.com/logistics/freightshippingoptions ) .
