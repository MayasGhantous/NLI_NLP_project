  the volume of a [ single 10 eurocent coin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_cent_euro_coin ) is [ 591,3 mm ^ 3 ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=pi%2f4*%7b19.75mm%7d%5e2*1.93+mm ) and weights 4,17 gram . 
  that means we can fit [ 4.786 \u00d7 10 ^ 6 ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=44,000+lbs+%2f+4.17+g ) coins by weight or [ 6.454 \u00d7 10 ^ 6 ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%7b110inch+*48inch+*+40inch%7d%2f%7b%7bpi%2f4*%7b19.75mm%7d%5e2*1.93+mm%7d*%7bpi%2f%7b2*sqrt%7b3%7d%7d%7d%7d ) by volume . 
  since we 're limited by weight this means each truck has a value of [ $ 478.600 ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%7b44,000+lbs+%2f+4.17+gram%7d*10+eurocent ) , thus we need [ 454.995 ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=greece+national+debt+%2f+%7b%7b44,000+lbs+%2f+4.17+gram%7d*10+eurocent%7d ) trucks . 
  this might pose a problem , since this is [ 2.18 trillion coins ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=greece+national+debt+%2f+%e2%82%ac0.10 ) , but europe only has [ 13 billion ] ( http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do;jsessionid=9265622453ff26cadec4dcaf928f3095?series_key=195.bkn.m.u2.nc10.c.10n1.as.s.q ) $ 0,10 coins . 
  no , not yet . 
  they still need to figure out who will tell the european council that they 're leaving . 
  webdings it is then . 
  do you know that how when you flood the bath , it spills all over the bathroom , into the hallway , down the stairs and all over the living room and kitchen ? 
  that 's the netherlands for ya : once there is one flood , it spills all over the country . 
  then there 's scandinavia , their baths are buried in a hole in the basement with a 30 meter wall around it . 
  ok , so i was n't wrong that the benelux also was part of the ecsc . 
  by clicking on the percentages you can see the % per topic . 
  we have quite a high turnout this time , i think the ` kiesdeler ' might reach 70.000 votes . 
  yes , people will consider both sides of the argument , and when they ca n't reach an agreement they will respect each other 's choices . 
   they opted for bunker oil and propane ah , they choose to destroy the environment instead . 
  power to the tukkers !, 
  grolsch is groot !, 
  for the australians : czech mate !, 
  same here in dutch : tsjechi\u00eb , we only change the last a to an e. 
  perhaps we can convince the saudis to sell their oil in euros now ? 
  americans are people who live in the usa , and happen to live in a state . 
  europeans are people who live in an european country that happens to be part of the eu . 
  ( yes yes , not all americans live in the usa , and not all european countries are part of the eu , you get the point ) . 
  but utc +0:20 is a non sense time anyways . 
  yeah , its no fun playing halo when you have to lose on purpose . 
  funny , air france and klm ( dutch ) are technically the same company . 
  you did that on purpose , did n't you ... 
  if you lay it out in $ 1 coins , it will span longer than one football field . 
  well , prepare your ignorant american side then ; we found out google has a buttload of money and we want a side of that . 
  well , since then we have changed strategies . 
  instead of making the dikes higher , we have made the rivers wider and have created dedicated flood zones that can be flood without doing much damage . 
  i think trump just does n't know how to shake hands . 
  the pull move is just part of a handshake for him , he does n't know otherwise . 
  water is our bitch . 
  my guess : electricity . 
  compared to germany , sweden ( and france ) have cheap electricity . 
  ( [ see this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/c/cf/electricity_prices_for_household_consumers%2c_second_half_2015_%28%c2%b9%29_%28eur_per_kwh%29_yb16.png ) ), 
  i ca n't really tell you . 
  this was explained to me by a friend who does european studies . 
  however , i think you got it the wrong . 
  this is n't a eu directive . 
  this was a regulation . 
  a directive gives member states some freedom in how to implement the directive into law . 
  it 's like a bare minimum . 
  the european net neutrality rules is a regulation . 
  a regulation is like a law that directly applies to all member states . 
  members do n't need to implement new laws or adjust existing ones just to comply with a regulation as the regulation is that law . 
  or to quote :  article 288   to exercise the union 's competences , the institutions shall adopt regulations , directives , decisions , recommendations and opinions . 
    a regulation shall have general application . 
  it shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all member states . 
    a directive shall be binding , as to the result to be achieved , upon each member state to which it is addressed , but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods . 
    a decision shall be binding in its entirety upon those to whom it is addressed . 
    recommendations and opinions shall have no binding force . 
  a bit more details : in the netherlands we had a law that forbade zero-rating . 
  then came the eu law that possible does allow zeros rating . 
  t-mobile has used zero rating on certain services , i think mainly music . 
  the acm ( think dutch fcc ) then sued t-mobile and the outcome was that eu law trumps the dutch law , thus the dutch law is invalid . 
  the acm has n't announced yet if they want to pursue this further . 
  do you know how inconvenient it is to have a sea in the middle of your country ? 
  well , we do n't . 
  we traded them in for the best upcoming f1 driver . 
  [ wij houden van oranje ] ( https://youtu.be/lterjkf8peo ) is about as dutch as it gets . 
  except we 're near 17 million now .

  [ the germans have you beat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantropa ), 
  when i was 15 there was a group of german tourists asking me where the camping site was . 
  since they came from the wrong side i told them to turn around and turn right at the 2nd intersection . 
  since they where 3 cars with caravan and one camper van it took them a while to turn around . 
  when i arrived near that intersection i just saw those tourists turning right as i told them too , only then i realised they should have gone left . 
  i never saw them again i think they still haunt the dutch countryside looking for that camping . 
  its ogene with an okay song . 
  kinda boring though so probably wo n't make it past the semifinals . 
  yes , having 14-15 year old drinking themselves into a coma is n't a reason to crack down on minors using alcohol . 
  it all has to do with the us . 
  i learned british english , but i 've made a switch to something in between . 
  mainly because firefox autocorrect does do uk english , but word insists i need us english , and i write most of my things in word . 
  plus i do n't know all the differences between uk and us english ( other than the extra u 's and s instead of z 's ) , so i tend to go with whatever autocorrect suggests . 
  also i have the typically dutch ` stonecoal english ' pronunciation , on in that regard i do n't really have an accent . 
   and where would we be without [ . . ] lager i think higher ? 
  a shopping cart is a students bbq . 
  actually , the dutch flag was there first . 
  do n't worry , i think poland is east europe . 
  i draw the line at germany/austria/italy, 
  you ca n't directly compare us models sold in the eu . 
  for example this laptop for sale at amazon ( us ) : [ $ 549,99 ext vat = $ 659.99 inc 20 % vat ] ( https://www.amazon.com/acer-aspire-e5-575g-53vg-laptop-windows/dp/b01dt4a2r4/ref=lp_13896615011_1_5?s=pc&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1478018636&amp;sr=1-5 ) = [ ~ $ 600 ] ( https://www.google.nl/webhp?q=659.98+usd+in+eur ) . 
  it is also for sale on amazon de : [ $ 746 , - ] ( https://www.amazon.de/acer-windows-e5-575g-53vg-version-importiert/dp/b01dt4a2r4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1478018708&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=acer+aspire+e+15+e5-575g-53vg+laptop%2c+15.6+full+hd+%28intel+core+i5%2c+nvidia+940mx%2c+8gb+ddr4%2c+256gb+ssd%2c+windows+10%29 ) . 
  nearly $ 150 more expensive . 
  however , a similar laptop sells for [ $ 629 , - ] ( https://www.amazon.de/acer-e5-575g-54tu-notebook-i5-6200u-geforce/dp/b01hebxiem/ref=sr_1_5?s=computers&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1478018888&amp;sr=1-5&amp;th=1 ) on amazon de . 
  similar in the netherlands , they need to card everyone under the age of 25 . 
  if you look younger than 25 you 'll get carded , even if you actually are older . 
  my university has launched a full offence against wrongly stalled bikes . 
  so now there are people standing around on campus telling you that you can only stall your bike in a rack . 
  and if you still park your bike wrong , it gets taken away to a depot . 
  that only means that we generally have low latency . 
  the high speed comes from the dense population here . 
  laying a new cable costs the same , but reaches more costumers . 
  that made sure that glasfiber spread very fast , proving healthy competition between fiber and cable internet . 
  in ~ 5-6 years i went from 60/6 mbps internet to 150/15 . 
  with thanks to every american teenage party movie ever .
