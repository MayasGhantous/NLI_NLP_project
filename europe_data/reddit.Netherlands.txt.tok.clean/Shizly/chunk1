that 's a stupid question , and it 's stupid news . 
  they do n't close it to keep schools white , but because there is a huge social gap between vmbo and havo/vwo . 
  countries still see syria as a country , yet they do n't support the government . 
  and here i was , thinking that judges decide on the punishment ... 
  i do n't see a reason to believe this . 
  never heard of it till now . 
  if you look in which countries are in that list , it 's still really impressive . 
  not that surprising , since the pm does n't matter that much in de grand scheme . 
  i think that when asked `` which cabinet '' ( or whatever the english word is ) , most people would say one of the paars ' without thinking twice . 
  it pretty much is in this case . 
  when talking about border crossings at least . 
  whut ? 
  you 've over 4500 comment karma and 300 link karma , with a roughly 1,5 year old account . 
  there probably is an investigation . 
  i do n't get why you would even waste time on such a poor troll . 
  and a little more specific ? 
  think of santa clause , only bigger . 
  now have peta trying to remove his reindeers because they would be abused and used as slaves and a pro-midget-society removing the elves because it 's discrimination to use elves/midgets as only labor force . 
  he obviously does n't mean that . 
  he means that it 's nice to know if you spent $ 5 on a beer or $ 50 . 
  to be fair , it *** is *** a landing craft . 
  that part he got right . 
  it costs 1800eur/year , but you get 1200eur/year to pay for it . 
  so it costs 600eur . 
  we 're changing to a loan system , but no one knows how it exactly going to work . 
  so only 1 country uses different ammo then the others ? 
  i would call that pretty successful . 
  you 're comparing national politics to international , which do n't work the same . 
  catalonia is n't a eu member by itself . 
  it would be stupid to have it as official language , since it is n't the language of the country . 
  so what ( possibly ) happened is that there where 10.000 votes in that district ( to say a number ) and all those 10.000 showed up , plus 2.400 that do n't live in that district ? 
  why would you being a member of the church or not need to be public information ? 
  i do n't see any reason for it . 
  because it is weird ? 
  why is the government involved in something private like this ? 
  i do n't see any reason for them being involved at all . 
  you do n't have to pay taxes to be a member of the soccer club , you pay membership to the soccer club itself . 
  and i think it 's really bad thing for the government to keep track of who are members of the church and who are not . 
  and then why even register as a member , if you can go to church without being registered ? 
  but why is it government controlled ? 
  you could say the same thing about any sort of club . 
  plus that registering to be able to go to church once does n't seem very ... `` church-y '' . 
  and if that is n't the case , i do n't see why you would register . 
  why ? 
  they ai n't government institutions , they 're private institutions . 
  you must browse a different sub then most of us . 
  / r/europe seems very pro-independence . 
  every language has fancy words , does n't make them hard to master . 
  that this will never happen is one of them . 
  it takes to many different policies to align . 
  we 're not even able to agree on the most basic military missions and subjects , let alone on enough to make us one . 
  plus that i ca n't think of anyone outside / r/europe wanting it . 
  this sub is do pro-eu it gets silly . 
  do n't get fooled by that . 
  not really i think . 
  no , that will never happen . 
  so pretty effective ? 
  well , see you guys again at the next live tread in 15/20 years ? 
  tried to make a joke about you voting no and those 2 you saw voting yes , 
  confirmed : 66,7 % voted yes , 33,3 voted no . 
  i 've never seen a code with double letters . 
  maybe there 's your error ? 
  you can look up the postal code online if you have the adress . 
  obama : my nukes could reach moscow in 2 hours, 
  16,8 million . 
  we already had to change songs about it ( 15 miljoen mensen op dat kleine stukkie aarde to 16 miljoen ) . 
  the cbs expects 17 million by 2020 and it peaking out around 2035 at 17,5 million . 
  no thanks . 
  we like to actually have a goverment . 
  and even they wanted to leave . 
  it was all within a kilometre or 2 on the same road . 
  would say the indies . 
  it was a big area . 
  plus it gives me a lot of resources in hoi3 , so i assume that 's true . 
  should have invaded it in the 80s . 
  missed opportunity right there . 
  it also did n't happen when paars was in power . 
  not familiar with swedish politics , but i assume there are more issues in the country then just the crisis ? 
  i definitely do n't vote last time on only the stance of the political party on the economic crisis . 
  it definitely is . 
  how on earth could germany be central europe , but switzerland be western europe ? 
  here is a tabel with the points laid out : http://www.ilga-europe.org/content/download/30409/187620/version/1/file/side+b+-+rainbow+europe+index+may+2014.pdf we do n't score points on : ** equality and non-discrimination ** * constitution ( sexual orientation ) * constitution ( sexual identity ) * employment ( gender identity ) * goods and services ( gender identity ) * law ( gender expression ) * law ( intersex ) ** family ** * registered partnership ( limited rights ) * hate crime law ( sexual orientation ) * bias motivated speech/violence * * hate crime law ( gender orientation ) * hate crime law ( gender orientation ) * policy tackling hatred ( gender identity ) * law ( intersex ) ** legal gender regulation ** * no `` gender identity disorder '' diagnoses/psychological opinion required ** asylum ** * gender identity this makes us score 70/100 points . 
  1 qualifier not necessarily being only 1 point . 
  and it 's fucking stupid . 
  they give 3 points for not castrating lbg persons , and 30 ( or something ) or lbg marriage . 
  they also give points for having special hate crime laws . 
  that 's a form of discrimination !, 
  and we ( dutch ) have the constitution saying that everyone shall be treated equal , which is n't good enough . 
  we have to say `` lbg are equal '' and make special , very specific laws about it . 
  i only see a couple of french people do it . 
  you want to have it ? 
  good to see some people support the north sea . 
  that only means that he not only let down himself , but also his supporters when we crush him like the fat river it is . 
  since the downvote button is n't a disagree button , upvote . 
  i would n't take any political poll were there are 2 options and one has been chosen 90 % + seriously . 
  i think he 's asking about the current situation . 
  the troubles are ( mostly ) over . 
  he said that . 
  he is comparing scotland to 2 other ( european ) countries who have their own currency . 
  that makes no sense .
