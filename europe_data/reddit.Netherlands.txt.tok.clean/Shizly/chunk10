  i really hope he was joking . 
  we also have something like that , but that 's almost twice as expensive . 
  is n't the one a political model and the other an economic ? 
  that sounds awkward . 
  accidental lipkis with that hot coworker ? 
  sign me up !, 
  than he should n't open the door . 
  if it where youths he would also be killed . 
  a 70yo with a knife ? 
  what a joke . 
  they are supposed to do this , but there ai n't enough people appointed to this task to trully enforce it . 
  exept that this post is about the laws of the country , not how common they are . 
  the 2 children that went with there father and are missing ever since . 
  the father was found dead , he killed himself . 
  no trace of the kids . 
  dutch . 
  i only see a eu flag at some governmental buildings i pass going to school as addition to the dutch flag . 
  never seen an eu flag anywhere else . 
  and i 'm pretty sure the building i 'm talking about has something to do with eu relations , but i ai n't able to remember dor sure . 
  it is.they 're social democratic , which means they 're left . 
  and they 're in coalition with a right-wing party , which means that they also have to make decision that can be considered right-winged . 
  in coalition with a left party . 
  they do n't repressent any political views and ai n't member of a political party . 
  so you can call them neutral . 
  no , we should n't . 
  since he had n't see them since 2005 ( if that 's true ) , they probably were n't that close already . 
  well , it is strange . 
  i think he means compered to europe . 
  that he hated , thought was a loser and did n't see since 2005 . 
  did you even watch that interview ? 
  take that , belgium !, 
  seriously , that 's your logic ? 
  if ** i ** use a cigarette , ** you ** wo n't die because of it . 
  if ** i ** use a land mine or biological weapon , ** you ** will die because of it . 
  how can you even ready something about medical benefits in that ? 
  i never even said something that sounds like that . 
  i repeat the question , when did i mention medicines ? 
  where is that mentioned in this comment tree ? 
  you known that 's a very bad analogy . 
  cigarettes are n't war weapons only used to kill other people , chemical weapons and landmines are, 
  who choose to take the risk . 
  and dying of longcancer = / = dying of smoking . 
  advertising is already banned and people smoke less and less , so social pressure also becomes less . 
  i 'm not agreeing with subsidising it , but we are boycotting it enough . 
  they 're provinces . 
  important difference on political level . 
  i 'm okay with this . 
  yeah , he created that law . 
  we do n't have tolls . 
  i 've never been so confused as now ... 
  as a hollander , i have the same problem with dutch =  german . 
  say `` i 'm learning dutch , i prefer you talk dutch to me '' . 
  now you think `` that sounds rude-ish '' . 
  no , it 's not . 
  you 're in the netherlands . 
  we are used to say what we think . 
  note to self : move to germany , be adorable . 
  mostly it 's a `` keep the change '' . 
  this cost me 18 euro 's ? 
  here , keep the 20 . '', 
  or it 's to get rid of to many coins . 
  so i would n't get a job/promotion because otherwise the company would n't meet there quota ? 
  no thanks , we can handle it without quota . 
  you should not be promoted on base of your gender , but on your ambitions and skills . 
  the parliament can choose the formateur themself , or choose to let the king/queen choose him . 
  normally they choose to let the queen choose one , but last them they just decided to do it themself . 
  i 'm making my country to shame ( 176cm ) ... 
  ( the queen is dead . 
  long live the king ! ), 
  wait , that 's not how we do it ? 
  we could n't even agree with a no-fly zone , and now we should have a complete eu army ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  more cooperation and better use of the battlegroups . 
  we have the divisions to strike as a eu army , but we are just not using them . 
  i do n't know which battlegroups are on the roster now , but we could send on of them . 
  myrto wrote a [ article ] ( http://isiseurope.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/eu-battlegroups-battling-irrelevance/ ) on how useless those devisions are already . 
  we have them , so use them !, 
  i agree that we ca n't go to all the countries . 
  but imo , when we see people rising up against their government , we should aid those . 
  when europe was forming itself we helped each other , and i think that we still should help each other out . 
  now only on a global level . 
  it 's even in our constitution to fight for international law . 
  i cite :  the military has the task to - defend the kingdom - defend the interests of the kingdom - maintain and promote the international law, 
  drm on books are one of the easiest to crack , especially those with adobe drm . 
  you can literally just use a drm remover . 
  the netherlands . 
  we pay x % income tax ( the average joe makes 33.000 e a year , what means he has to pay 40 % ) . 
  then we have to pay around 80-100 euro 's for insurance that includes services that are stated by law . 
  you could expand this ( e.q. 
  dentist insurance , pt , etc. ) . 
  it seems that we pay a lot , but i just had a mri scan and got researched by a sport doctor because my knee was hurting me . 
  they could n't find anything and said that i had to train more and should start pt again . 
  did n't pay a single cent for that . 
  and yes , i 'm happy with it . 
  you do n't have to worry about anything . 
  sometimes i see those posts on reddit , collecting for money to pay a sick child 's cancer treatment or something and i think , `` damn , i 'm glad i do n't have to worry about that '' . 
  according to wikipedia , i meant winteroorlog . 
  the boy found a raf pilote and helpt him . 
  just here to say i really enjoyed winteroorlog ( winter war ) . 
  about the winter of 1945 , the last winter in wwii and a 15 year old boy who wants to help the dutch resistance .
