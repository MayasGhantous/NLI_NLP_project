  not everyone only plans for tomorrow . 
  there are 75 in service and more to be delivered . 
  the most reported downsides and problems ( to heavy , not enough passengers ) turned out to not be a problem at all . 
  it 's an example of a great project . 
  every single military creation ever has the problems you mention . 
  yes , deciding how people are able to spent their entire lives is just a petty thing ... 
  there 's nothing going on there . 
  a couple people saying their going home and a lot of people talking about how great the hashtag is . 
  it does n't proof anything , let alone that this picture is close to the truth . 
  that 's their problem . 
  it 's a title , not a tl : dr. 
  that 's a very big difference . 
  then he could just tape it off . 
  plus , people should n't do this even when they 're not being surveilled . 
  you should n't want people on the police force that only behave when you look over their shoulders . 
  you said that people regarded it as a police state , which is something different then comparing it . 
  we know . 
  the article says that . 
  get off your high horse , it 's also being compared to mexico and other countries . 
  police brutality in america has also been widely covered here , so it 's a well known example . 
  it 's dumb to compare it to something only a few people know about , since it makes the comparison useless . 
   since decades many regard germany as a `` police state '' . 
  then they 're dumb as fuck . 
  it 's disgusting to see how people compare their free countries to real police states , where you have to be afraid every time you go to sleep . 
  hoping that they wo n't come to take you away . 
  especially if you compare it to , well , pre-1990 . 
  how would that have changed the situation ? 
  true . 
  that 's why i also proved the second study who compared 10 high income countries . 
  as i said , there is a big difference between buying food and buying diner . 
  i could get my calories for 3eur/day by only eating mars bars . 
  meanwhile , it would cost 7eur/day to get my calories from apples . 
  that does n't mean that having a healthy diet is more then twice as expensive . 
  according to the [ stfm ] ( http://www.stfm.org/fmhub/fm2010/april/andrew280.pdf ) , a junk food diet costs twice as much then a healthy diet . 
  and a [ harvard study ] ( http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/healthy-vs-unhealthy-diet-costs-1-50-more/ ) compared 27 studies on the matter in 10 high income countries and concluded that eathing healthy costs only 1.50 usd/day more . 
  from the last link :  to address this question , the hsph researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 27 existing studies from 10 high-income countries that included ** price data for individual foods and for healthier vs. less healthy diets ** . 
  researching the price of food and the price of a certain diet are completely different things . 
  the telegraph completely butchered the study ( or the study is wrong , but i doubt it ) . 
  it could n't be more from the truth . 
  look at the lists they post . 
  a box of chocolates , doughnuts and ice creams are n't complete meals . 
  the healthy ones form a diet , the junk ones form snacks that are used in addition to a meal . 
  obviously a snicker bar is cheaper then a sallad per calorie . 
  they serve different functions in the diet . 
  there is no proven link between being poor and being fat . 
  plus , exercise . 
  it does work . 
  [ arnold schwarzenegger ] ( http://www.phootoscelebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/arnold-schwarzenegger-pics.jpg ) and [ dwayne johnson ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/15/article-0-1d1ec50000000578-244_634x639.jpg ) have a bmi of around 33 at the time of this picture . 
  you have to be in the extremes before it does n't work anymore . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  unlikely . 
  when it does n't count for you , you know it . 
  it does n't count for people who are mainly muscle and hang around in the gym for god knows how long . 
  many people sadly think that bmi probably does n't count for them , since bmi is a `` catch-all '' system . 
  being in the low and high range of `` healthy '' is also not so good of course . 
  but ` bmi is n't useful because muscles ! '', 
  is something that gets used very often , while it really should n't matter that much . 
  he 's not wrong . 
  there is for almost everyone who is overweight no excuse . 
  even on a individual level it 's useful . 
  in my situation there is 20kg between `` underweight '' and `` overweight '' . 
  between 60 and 80kg i would be at a healthy weight . 
  it wo n't be exactly right , but it still is useful for determinate if you 're under/overweight or not . 
  even the second poorest country has a gdp/pp that 's 2 times higher . 
  there is no reason to assume there is a connection . 
  it happens both ways .

  it 's on page 102 and further . 
  no worries , they 're still number one in true europe . 
  and in my anecdotal story the situation is completely the opposite . 
  i used to work with a lot of poles and a lot of them were obese . 
  and lithuania has 26 % obesity rate . 
  it makes no sense whatsoever . 
  it would n't have been different . 
  we could go in with more guns , but we did n't since the alliance promised air support . 
  that 's where things went wrong . 
  thank you once again , karma police !, 
  we have the de witth brothers to thank for the massive failure against the french . 
  they are the ones that wanted to keep the oranges out when the people wanted them in . 
  they made deals with enemies behind our backs . 
  they made the cuts in the military . 
  and we did n't use them , even though we where involved in both those wars . 
  no , it 's not to vague at all . 
  it is impossible to name every ground you could possibly discriminate on . 
  we decided to say that discrimination is forbidden , done . 
  you 're making it seem a lot harder then it is . 
   i do n't know if that is true if you read their report , you see that is is true . 
  and our laws ai n't good enough for them . 
  they want special treatment for hate crimes , that you will be punished more severe if you beat the living crap out a homosexual instead of a hetero . 
  straight copy paste from our constitution , first article :  all persons in the netherlands shall be treated in equal circumstances . 
  discrimination on the grounds of religion , belief , political opinion , race , or sex or on any other grounds whatsoever shall not be permitted . 
  so there is no reason why we should . 
  we said `` any other grounds whatsoever '' . 
  and even though our constitution did n't specify it , our criminal laws do :  article 137c  he who , in public , deliberately spreads insults by mouth , by writing or by image , groups of people on grounds of race , religion , lifestyle , hereto - or homosexuality , physical or mental well being , shall be punished by one year prison or a fine from the third category ( at most ) . 
  the problem with this organisation is that they ** want ** to be treated special . 
  they want to be treated differently . 
  they want that we create laws , specifically for the homosexuals . 
  not for the coloured , not for the religious , but only for them . 
  what ? 
  it can take weeks before we form our government , so the market should n't be effected to much .
