  * those we resigned where employed by the president ( except the judge and maybe the consul ) . 
  them resigning means they did n't side with the government , which make it assumable that they side with the protesters .

  weird that no police officer has died yet if that would be true . 
  yeah , but police has guns with rubber bullets . 
  use of molotov cocktails is unnecessary . 
  i just said . 
  plus that the police have the protective armor , while the protesters do n't . 
  this is pretty useless . 
  some get 0.2 l , other 0.5 l. 
  just say how many l you could get and divide that in 0.5 / 0.33 / 0.22 l would be way more accurate . 
  yeah , but police has guns with rubber bullets . 
  use of molotov cocktails is unnecessary . 
  i ca n't find an english source ( kyivpost seems down ) , so i translated a dutch one : from the [ volkskrant live update ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2664/nieuws/article/detail/3582441/2014/01/23/live-president-oekraine-wil-eventueel-ontslag-regering-in-parlement-bespreken.dhtml ) :  ** 21.29 - kiev waits on the results **  a spokesman of the opposition stated that it 's `` very likely '' that a solution for the crisis will be found after the negotiations with the ukrainian president . 
   a crowd on the central square in kiev are waiting on the outcome of the negotiations . 
  meanwhile , orthodox priests try to maintain the weak truce between the police and the protesters . 
  * ( as you can see on the live streams ) *  the protests started after janoekovitsj refused to sign the trade agreement with the european union and instead contacted the russians . 
  the protests were peaceful for most of the time , but last weekend violence brook out . 
  i do n't know about the 8pm attack . 
  the 3 occupations where at the cities lviv , rivne and cherkasy . 
  you did n't say something about journalist directly . 
  but let 's take a second to look at the comment you responded to . 
  he did say something about journalists . 
  ** in other parts of the country ** :  8:30 pm : around 20 thousand people are storming the building of regional state administration in cherkasy . 
  they are trying to break in . 
  10 police officers and 10 officers of gryfon division are staying inside the building not to let people in . 
  they 've started using flash grenades and water hosens against participants of the rally . 
  * -- anastasia forina * from : [ kyivpost live updates ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/euromaidan-rallies-in-ukraine-jan-23-live-updates-335389.html ) video : [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efnucz2uguq&amp;hd=1 ) there already were 2 city councils taken , the one from lviv and the one in rivne . 
  the head of council in liviv has signed a letter of resignation around 2:00 pm . 
  see the video of the storming of lviv : [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dletsawowe&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;hd=1 ) ** mayor of lviv ** the mayor had to following statement :  mayor andriy sadoviy condemned violence , said that the city mourns the dead and that all expenses and organization of funeral for activist , native lviv resident yuroy verbytskiy , will be handled by the city . 
  he also asked the citizens not to block the public transport to make sure that women with children whose husbands left for kyiv could access doctors by public transport . 
  `` and to wrap it up , none of the laws that violate the constitution of ukraine and common sense will ever apply on the territory of lviv city . 
  good health to everyone . 
  glory to ukraine !, 
  glory to heroes ! '', 
  * -- katya gorchinskaya * from : [ kyivpost live updates ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/euromaidan-rallies-in-ukraine-jan-23-live-updates-335389.html ), 
  there has been at least 1 protester with a small pistol at the protest . 
  see [ this picture ] ( http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/ukraine012214/s_u28_69801015.jpg ) . 
  i do n't know the story behind it and it seems to be the only incident with a firearm involved . 
  & gt ; journalists are tortured & gt ; protestors are . . 
  i think i found an error in your logic . 
  any confirmation on rivne and lviv ? 
  i heard protesters took over the region boards . 
  [ twitpic ] ( https://twitter.com/svaboda/status/426344331440422912/photo/1 ), 
  exept that the `` opposition '' is fighting with eachother . 
  the isis declared war on everyone who does n't have the same goals , making that the isis ( islamic state of iraq ) and the islamic front are fighting with each other , while they almost have the same goal . 
  nrc had a good [ article ] ( http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/01/22/tien-vragen-over-syrie-die-je-niet-durfde-te-stellen/ ) about the current situation and how it all started . 
  an other photo special of last night by an other newspaper : [ link ] ( http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/4565/buitenland/photoalbum/detail/3582491/492382/0/vlammend-protest-in-nachtelijk-kiev.dhtml ) ** title : ** flaming protests at night in kiev ** description : ** the silhouette of the pro-europe protesters at the burning barricades are very visible in the night . 
  according to sources at least 2 people died in clashes between the protesters and the police . 
  they fight the riot police with molotov cocktails , rocks and burning tires . 
  the police shoots back with rubber bullets . 
  the flames , and the smoke , created the main city of ukraine in a war zone . 
  thank you for that . 
  it 's a really interesting read . 
  thanks for reminding me . 
  i forget that an eye for a eye is completely acceptable without any interfering by a judge . 
  a photo special of one of our newspapers : [ link ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2734/foto/photoalbum/detail/3582066/492248/0/doden-bij-hevige-rellen-in-kiev.dhtml ) ** the title ** says `` multiple dead at the riots in kiev '' ** description : ** the main city of ukraine was in flames today . 
  the `` independence square '' in kiev was the main stage for heavy rioting between anti-government protesters and the riot police . 
  the talks between president janoekovitsj and 3 opposition leader did n't have any results . 
  the ukraine government took a pro-russian approach the last couple months , while the opposition want a pro-european approach . 
  after 2 months of heavy protesting , janoekovitsj tries to end the protests with much violence . 
  the activists fight back with the same level of power . 
  according to the opposition there are 5 deaths as a result of the clashes with the riot police . 
  the clashes are between snow and fire , which gave us these images . 
  any cares to give a tl ; dr of what he is saying [ here ] ( http://youtu.be/d0pdtp1p4dg?t=43s ) ( from 0:42 ) ? 
  i would love to hear his story . 
  yeah , fuck the justice system !, 
  let 's just start murdering people ... 
  naa , he 's saying that it 's a competition . 
  thank you for the link . 
  can anyone eli5 what 's going on ? 
  i know that police and rioters are fighting , but why ? 
  ca n't say that the media over here have really reported about it . 
  the only think i know is that when the opposition leader went on the stage he was yelled at and accused of being a traitor and a thief .
