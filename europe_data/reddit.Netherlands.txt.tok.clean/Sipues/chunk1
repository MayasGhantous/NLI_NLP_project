* edit * i would rather vote for arjan lubach to be the first farao of the netherlands than be part of the `` stemvee '' of roos and baudet . 
  those two deserve a fiasco not a victory . 
  so downvote me as much as you want , i do n't care . 
  by the way , every time i vote for national elections or eu parliament , i vote for a pro european party . 
  no need for this fake events . 
  a day of sorrow for the netherlands and catalunya . 
  my dutch husband is really sad today . 
  we 'll watch tomorrow 's game ( france-the netherlands ) with mixed feelings . 
  his own twitter account is ( was ) ( still is ) [ @johancruyff ] ( https://twitter.com/johancruyff?s=09 ), 
  that was n't my point . 
  my point is that everything in life is temporary and ever-changing . 
  even those is bastards shall pass too !, 
  this are the [ terrorists !, 
  ] ( http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/36484/aanslagen-brussel/article/detail/2654485/2016/03/22/dit-zijn-de-verdachten-van-de-aanslag-in-zaventem.dhtml?utm_campaign=echobox&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook#link_time=1458657038 ), 
  incredible that gerry adams ( lider sinn fein ) just twitted this : [ `` all sinn f\u00e9in team & visitors safe in brussels '' . ] ( https://twitter.com/gerryadamssf/status/712190857412272129 ) . 
  who would ever thought , 40 years ago , that [ they would also condemn terrorism ] ( https://twitter.com/gerryadamssf/status/712222979984326656 ), 
  it 's a new and special kind of english created by [ manchester united 's dutch trainer louis van gaal ] ( https://youtu.be/ad1hjcycpes ) . 
  true . 
  and i do n't even watch `` opsporing verzocht '', 
  they steal audi and bmw cars because those are fast and because they can hack very easily keyless ignition cars . 
  germany has lately a problem with a [ dutch burglers gang crashing atm machines with audi and bmw cars . 
  ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2016/02/dutch-burglary-suspects-killed-in-high-speed-crash-in-germany/ ) sometimes in combination with explosives . 
  but this is berlin , far from the border and it was a volkswagen passat . 
  * edit * this is a group of young criminals from utrecht and amsterdam . 
  they invented their modus operandi here in the netherlands . 
  we have had this problem for a while and they are expanding to germany . 
  here is an article about this in dutch . 
  those from the accident were a part of the gang . 
  thank you for this links . 
  i could use google translate to search for lithuanian terms but it is not going to find the gems that only a native speaker can . 
  ~ ~ i know too little about your country . 
  i would love to see lithuania 's old pics ! ~ ~ i found this great videos on youtube about lithuania before ww2 and the soviet occupation . 
  enjoy [ 1 ] ( https://youtu.be/wjfpayhkzj4 ) and [ 2 ] ( https://youtu.be/enuzzdunk8u ), 
  at least they have space . 
  traveling by train in the netherlands is pretty bad . 
  no seats and crowded . 
  it 's an invasion of your personal space and being short is even worse when your face is close to all those armpits !, 
  but i ca n't complain . 
  it 's nice to talk to strangers here . 
  people are still kind . 
  i 've a lidl 10 minutes bicycling but i do n't like to go there anymore . 
  workers never look happy and have a lot of discussions with other coworkers because they are working extra time and do n't get paid for that . 
  very late with my answer but , once i went to madrid ( with my company , also paid by my company ) and stayed in a good hotel . 
  me and my dutch colleagues were amazed ( and very happy ) to see this amazing iberico , resting on a ham holder . 
  we were aloud to carve it ourselves !, 
  it was too much . 
  every morning we waked up very early for this , despite the hang over thanks to the good spanish wine the night before . 
  in other countries trough europe , continental breakfast means a very sad choice of cold meats and bad bread . 
  do n't forget that latinos are christian conservatives and against many liberal ideas like abortion . 
  i was born there and ( sadly ) i know many people who thinks like trump . 
  it looks like a thermostatic radiator valve . 
  the central heating system works independent from the warm water . 
  if you are living in europe now , chances are that the heating system is on in summer mode . 
  you 'll need to change that first . 
  second , the thermostatic valve regulates the warmth in the room according to the temperature . 
  if it 's sensing a normal temperature , it would not heat the room above that . 
  if everything is working well , maybe you could check the valve : [ plumber tutorial video . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/phfw-iish54 ), 
  you need a taco truck on every corner !, 
  i really miss it in english . 
  i have to reread sometimes , questions without the ` auxiliary verb + subject + main verb ' or ` wh-questions ' constructions like in tag-questions where the author expresses emphasis or irony . 
  `` and that is all we have ? '', 
  eigenlijk andersom : [ `` friesland is thought to be one of the source locations for anglo-saxon immigration both because of its geographical location and because frisian is considered to be the closest extant language to old english '' ] ( http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/7/1008.full ), 
  how about that !, 
  daar in het oosten van het land is of warmer in de zomer of kouder in de winter dan in het westen . 
  al escrito da igual . 
  well , i do n't have nothing else to add to this subject . 
  have a good day sir . 
  this is n't true at all . 
  11-12-2015 : `` the court in rotterdam convicted on friday 44 feyenoord supporters , for their role in the riots in rome around the match against as roma feyenoord europa league in february . 
  [ article in dutch '' ] ( http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/4181100/feyenoord-fans-krijgen-celstraf-en-taakstraffen-rellen-rome.html ) we also paid and repair the damage those idiots did . 
  we were very upset that they destroyed a historic fountain but never blame the roman police for the violence and destruction caused by those fucktards . 
  in the netherlands the worst hooligans are n't aloud to be close to a stadium during a potentially violent match . 
  it seems impossible to control the problem but it is n't because it is a structural one . 
  if the russian football federation is able to identify [ people like this guy ] ( http://static2.hln.be/static/photo/2016/4/10/4/20160612112949/media_xl_8747224.jpg ) , which is very easy , and give them a restrain order , then you , other normal people and kids could be able to enjoy a game . 
  make haste !, 
  make haste !, 
  conchita currywurst-is-life, 
  does eurovision has a channel ? 
  i know, 
  stop discussing with t_d trolls . 
  for your own health . 
  that 's why referenda may only be used in case a zoo wants people to name a baby elephant or to name a boot ( boaty mcboatface ) but never to solve a complicated issue that needs highly educated experts who have real facts and are n't populists . 
  i saw an interview before the referendum , with a farmer who exported her dairy products mainly to europe and gets eu subsidies . 
  she was saying that she would vote leave . 
  i did n't understand why she thought that was best for her . 
  [ you may stay here as long as you want . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36612916 ), 
  i thought that it was colored grouping the eurovision voting tendencies . 
  did n't notice the uk missing until reading the comments . 
  til !, 
  this map is missing [ argentina . 
  or matthew perry . 
  that would be strange . 
  this comment made my day : `` trump was worried a strong german woman like angela merkel might crush his tiny hands '', 
  groenlinks is always nr 1 in the city but not in the province . 
  i am !, 
  thanks !, 
  those comments . 
  so laughable .
