  i agree with everything you just said barring one part . 
   however , if you are in the uk , the next question then is whether it 's also worth exporting from the uk to elsewhere in the world ( maybe the uk gets a better trade deal with china or the us than the eu has , maybe the uk manages to set up some preferential trading arrangement with some commonwealth countries , whatever . . ) . 
  if it is , then why not take advantage of that too . 
  that 's where some of the friction with the eu may well kick in , if it is cheaper or easier to shift your cars to china if they are made in the uk than if they are made in germany , then the uk could ` steal ' some of those exports and the associated jobs . 
  this also not a clear cut case . 
  chinese and american market are factors larger than the uk larger . 
  if the uk would have a free-trade deal with the us or china . 
  it would make way more sense to produce in the us or china and transport the smaller percentage of the production that is bound for the uk ( since it has a smaller market ) over an ocean . 
  than it is to transport the bulk of production as would likely be the case if it was produced in the uk . 
  now obviously there are things like productivity , specialization , details of the fta that influence the decision . 
  going to need to disagree here . 
   preach ever more centralization , ignoring the principle of subsidiarity prescribed in the lisbon treaty . 
  subsidiarity as the man said is just a principle not a hard set law . 
  i think the federation that adheres to this the most is the swiss federation . 
  still the swiss federal government is in charge of some of the most important policies because they ca n't be done by its cantons . 
  look up speeches of verhofstadt , he is mostly preaching for things like border control and a european fbi . 
  this does n't defeat the subsidiarity principle . 
  verhofstadt has also said that he thinks there are things currently done by the eu he would like to see back at the national level . 
   advocate harmonisation at the expense of competitveness do not really know what specifics he is pointing at but it depends on the harmonization . 
  it can also lead to more competitiveness . 
   support socialisation of state and banking debts . 
  now this one is intresting considering the next one  stick to a one-size-fits-all-euor which has put millions of people out of jobs in the south of europe . 
  did n't he just mention about competitiveness . 
  having a national currency is a means to hide your uncompetitiveness . 
   allow the breaking of commitments , laws and agreements such as the treaty of maastricht , the fiscal compact or the dublin agreement . 
  is it just me or had the national governments already decided they could play loose with these agreements . 
   do you know why only banks can take loans from ecb ? 
  because they demand that banks need to follow certain legislation to make the system safer . 
  if everybody can take loans from ecb you would have to undermine the whole system and would make it riskier . 
  the articles does n't mention loans only an account or wallet so i guess they would n't be able to do this . 
  as you said companies already issue their own debt . 
   it is not worth it for normal companies to become banks just to be able to loan from ecb . 
  i guess that is something for companies to decide . 
   instead you let the financial sector do what they are efficient at and pay them a small fee for being able to take a loan . 
  the loan part yes that is what you need the finance sector for ( although not necessarily a lot of companies issue their own bonds ) . 
  yet again loans are not mentioned in the piece . 
  the service the bank offers for the actual payments is minimal since most of it is already automized . 
  the swiss wir bank is a good example of how something like this might work  the wir bank , formerly the swiss economic circle ( german : wirtschaftsring-genossenschaft ) , or wir , is an independent complementary currency system in switzerland that serves businesses in hospitality , construction , manufacturing , retail and professional services . 
  wir issues and manages a private currency , called the wir franc , which is used , in combination with swiss franc to generate dual-currency transactions . 
  [ wir bank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wir_bank ), 
  a lot of what you said is true . 
  but a company does have cash and that cash is currently held by banks . 
  they have this cash because they need to pay bills like paying employees . 
  the banks are currently the ones that provide the infrastructure for these payments . 
  that 's why some call them `` system banks '' or something of the like . 
  the trouble with large banks going under is exactly that . 
  these large banks manage the accounts of a lot of companies large and small not to mention consumers . 
  if the bank goes under all the entities ( companies and consumers ) that had an account with the bank are no longer able to use that account to pay the bills . 
  this is why the banks had to be bailed out . 
  the economy which has largely become digital no longer has the ` infrastructure ' it needs to function . 
  now this is stupid to begin with because the real ` banking infrastructure ' that allows the transfer of money between the banks is provided by the central bank . 
  the only reason why banks are the ones that provide the ` private infrastructure ' , the infrastructure we use and would thus collapse , is because the central bank does n't allow non-banks to have an account at the central bank . 
   everybody holding air printed by ecb will not create anything . 
  you do know that the whole economic system is manager by an electronic currency the ecb creates right ? 
  video with some explanation : https://youtu.be/kvpbqlqwl0a?t=16m10s, 
  i should rephrase . 
  among other things . 
   ** reforms in law : ** in 1804 , napoleon took on the legal system of france . 
  the system of laws was in a state of chaos . 
  laws were not codified and were based on roman law , ancient custom or monarchial paternalism . 
  during the revolution , many laws were changed . 
  it was difficult to determine what law applied in any given situation , and laws were not equally applied to everyone . 
   the mishmash of laws were codified and written clearly so that the people could determine what law applied . 
  it incorporated much of the roman law . 
  for the first time in history , the law was based on reason and founded on the notion that all men were equal before the law . 
  it guaranteed individual rights ( except for women and blacks ) and the security of property . 
  in short it codified many of the ideals of the revolution . 
  the napoleonic code became profoundly influential to other european countries in the 19th century . 
   ** reforms in government : **  napoleon centralized the government , putting control firmly in the hands of the national government . 
  it became more efficient . 
  advancement in the civil service and the military was based on merit rather than rank . 
  the tax system was applied equally to all . 
   ** reforms in education : **  napoleon built many new lycees , schools for boys age 10 to 16 . 
  he recognized the importance of education in producing citizens capable of filling positions in his bureaucracy and military . 
  although he did not create a system of mass education , education was more available to the middle class than it ever had been before . 
  at a meeting in 1807 he declared :  of all our institutions public education is the most important . 
  everything depends on it , the present and the future . 
  it is essential that the morals and political ideas of the generation which is now growing up should no longer be dependent upon the news of the day or the circumstances of the moment . 
  above all we must secure unity : we must be able to cast a whole generation in the same mould . 
  he saw education as a way of indoctrinating `` right-thinking '' citizens from an early age . 
  he did n't see the need to educate girls , since they could learn everything they needed from their mothers . 
  they were not to be active citizens . 
  [ historywiz ] ( http://www.historywiz.com/reforms.htm ) a lot of these are still the basics of european law and other institutions . 
  in all honesty the pvv has been predicted to be the winner for quite some time . 
  yet it seems that every time the dutch go into the voting boot they decide to vote differently . 
  he has been a mp for 18 years and the rumor is that indoors he is just your average politician . 
  i think actually winning an election might be the end for the pvv which was mostly synonymous with a protest vote . 
  we might but the eu does n't . 
  but it is n't for banks . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  if this actually happens a company can open an account at the central bank and circumvent the bank . 
  the whole reason banks are too-big-to-fail is because if they fail the payment system collapses . 
  once companies and maybe even citizens have these accounts this is no longer the case . 
  could n't find anything through a google search ? 
  could you explain ? 
  i depends how many non-banks decide to have such an account and how much money is in it . 
  i am secretly hoping it is just the first step to changing the whole financial structure . 
  oh sorry ~ ~ do you ~ ~ did she really have to say that . 
  i meant did she really have to say it in the speech, 
  i saw a bit on tv .
