ah , you 're right . 
  i was mainly thinking about elections , were the election of the tweede kamer is done by direct democracy while the eerste kamer ( the senate ) is elected indirectly by the people . 
  anyway , i do n't really see how this is different in most other european countries . 
  it 's not like belgium or germany have got a lot of referenda , right ? 
  yes , there are some countries that have a referendum by law when making important decisions . 
  but that 's not the case for most eu countries if i 'm not mistaking . 
  i understand that our democracy needs a lot of improving , but this map is giving a comparison . 
  as far as i know , we 're not really less democratic than germany , or belgium for example . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong though , maybe most european countries have more direct democracy than we do . 
  regarding the eu-constitution . 
  remember france voted ` no ' too . 
  the fact that we were ignored , does not mean that it 's any better in other countries . 
  all countries that voted against the constitution ignored their people , and pushed it through anyway . 
  which was a extraordinarily despicable decision by the way . 
  decisions being made by a small group in power , whilst completely ignoring the will of the people ( who formally said ` no ' in masses ) . 
  we 've got a formal name for that . 
  but anyways . 
  my point is that i agree with you on the fact that our country is not as democratic as we like to think . 
  but when comparing it to other countries it is not that bad . 
  ( that does n't make it any better , but it gives a reasonable explanation why we do pretty well on the map , despite having issues ), 
   there is a lack , a complete absence to be exact , of direct democracy in the netherlands . 
  the parliament is chosen directly by the people . 
  the formation of government is the same as most european countries . 
  the senate is not directly elected by the people , but other than that i do n't see why we 'd score lower than the rest of europe . 
  it 's not like other countries ' leaders do n't break their campaign promises all the time . 
  there 's a lot to be improved on dutch democracy , but the statement that there 's a complete absence of direct democracy is simply untrue . 
  i 'm pretty sceptical towards most main parties in the netherlands . 
  but it 's not like the situation is worse than the rest of western europe . 
  i know , that does n't make it any better , but remember that this whole thing is a comparison . 
  so it does explain why we still score this high . 
  you do n't have to be good to be the best , you simply have to be better than the second place, 
  which would be an appropriate reaction if actual neo-nazis would have won the elections . 
  so ... what 's the issue with corbyn exactly ? 
  the argument that he 's unelectable is not very strong coming from candidates who all lost the election to corbyn . 
  that 's not what the referendum was about ... 
  it has been for a few years . 
  https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/greece-primary-balance.png by the way , this year their surplus has slipped into a small deficit . 
  of course it 's ` just ' the primary surplus , what would you expect from a country that has to pay billions in debt ? 
  even the current surplus ( which is mandatory due to agreements with the troika ) is absolute madness , their economy has shrunk by 25 % since the austerity measurements . 
  all i was saying is that the budget itself is pretty much balanced . 
  in fact , if you look at the cyclically adjusted primary surplus , greece is by far the most fiscally responsible nation in the eu . 
  [ source ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/does-greece-need-more-austerity/ ) the problem does n't lie with the greek government overspending , it lies much deeper than that . 
   and really , i do n't care what ya have to give up . 
  you have to balance the budget thats certain . 
  you know that greece has been running a small surplus last few years , right ? 
  this ca n't be said about , for example , the netherlands . 
  `` austria sent a guy with a beard for a change '' - jan smit ( dutch commentator ), 
  i have a developed similar plan in the past , but with norway . 
  the netherlands invades norway . 
  in case we win , we 'll have norway so we will be rich . 
  if we lose , just let us get annexed by norway so we will be part of norway , and we will be rich . 
  either way we win . 
  as long as the un or the eu does n't ruin the party with peace negotiations , there is n't a single scenario where we wo n't win . 
  i ca n't imagine anything else . 
  i 'm 100 % sure germany has more internet users than sweden has citizens . 
  welp , it 's time to move . 
  the cheapest i found was $ 37.50 per month for 10gb of data and unlimited texts . 
  ( and you got a free spotify subscription , you ca n't get this bundle without this spotify subscription ) . 
  if you use vodafone , you pay $ 40 per month for 6gb of data , t-mobile costs $ 35 per month for 5gb and tele2 $ 38 per month for 4gb . 
  ( bigger data bundles are not available , they do all offer unlimited texts and calls . 
  opting for less texts saves you about $ 6 , in that case you get 300 texts or 300 minutes in the case of tele2 , so it wo n't save you a lot ) those are all carriers with their own network . 
  virtual providers are often a bit cheaper , but it wo n't be anywhere in the vicinity of what you 're saying . 
  what ? 
  where do you live ? 
  in the netherlands you 'd pay about $ 40 euro 's per month for a sim-only package like that . 
  ( i checked t-mobile and vodafone , $ 35 and $ 40 respectively for a comparable plan ), 
  the nos ( kinda the dutch version of bbc ) came with the following ( translated by me ) :  ** what options does prime minister rutte have after the ukraine-referendum : **   he read the entire treaty between the eu and ukraine from a to z. 
  this was not always fun , but henri de weale does know what options are left for prime minister rutte now the treaty has been rejected by the dutch voters . 
  the professor in international and european law at radboud university in nijmegen gives five options . 
     ** reconsider **   rutte can follow the outcome by reconsidering the treaty and then accept it anyway . 
  rutte could say the following :   `` we 've looked at the results and listened to the voters . 
  but polls show that two-thirds of the population thinks this treaty is about ukraine entering the eu . 
  that is not the case . 
  that is why i am not following the advice from the dutch population . '', 
    ** declaration **   rutte can write a declaration to stipulate a few things . 
  for example , ukraine wo n't suddenly enter the eu due to this treaty , or that the country wo n't get new cash flows from the eu . 
  this part can be added to the treaty . 
  all member states could then agree with this declaration . 
  this is , juridically speaking , the easiest option . 
    ** exception **   the netherlands can ask for a special position at the council of the eu . 
  this will be about 10 % of the treaty . 
  the other 90 % , about trade , can not be chanced at all . 
  exemption could be possible for the parts about corruption , treatment of animals , transport and energy . 
  the netherlands could abstain from the negotiations on this after the council approves . 
      ** tweaking the treaty **  changing the text is a very complex option . 
  juridically it wo n't make a lot of difference , but symbolically this can be very important . 
  the biggest disadvantage : the entire eu and ukraine have to agree again . 
    ** reject the treaty ** :   a veto for the entire treaty is the fifth option . 
  this would lead to new negotiations between the eu and ukraine . 
  in other words , we 'll be back at the start . 
  the netherlands wo n't just suffer reputational damage . 
  but chances are negotiations will get stuck and we wo n't get a treaty at all . 
  in the end it wo n't chance a much , i am pretty sure of this . 
  this whole treaty was more a signal of disapproval to the ( direction of the ) eu in general , than a middle finger towards ukraine . 
  they ca n't , that 's not how this referendum works . 
  ehm , what ? 
  the most left-wing party in parliament was the one who campaigned most aggressively * against * this treaty . 
  the parties that voted against this treaty were sp , pvdd and the pvv . 
  not exactly a right-wing coalition if you ask me . 
  ( not left-wing either , but it 's foolish to claim this issue as a right-wing one ),
