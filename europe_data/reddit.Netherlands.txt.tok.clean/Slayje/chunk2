  these 14 prabably ** are ** part of far right groups though , as these groups do visit every protest against new asylum shelters , which happen fairly often nowadays . 
  the majority of the people present are regular citizens who were aiming to have a peaceful protest over the way the manucipality is handling the situation . 
  just like part of the refugees are scumbags , some of the protesters were too . 
  the manucipality is 27k people , the town itself around 10k people . 
  moreover , people are mostly frustrated over the fact that they have no say whatsoever in the matter , and practical thing like : - when a citizen or company files a request to build something , the procedures can take years to complete . 
  this shelter is pushed through within three days . 
  - the manucipality made some bad purchases ( on ground , property ) and has money troubles , they made a loss of 35 million . 
  allowing the federal government to build an asylum shelter will grant the manucipality a lot of extra money over the backs of unhappy citizens . 
  but i guess if you want to call these concerned citizens ` nazi 's ' you 're allowed to . 
  no way the other nato members are going to war with russia over erdogan 's turkey though . 
  thanks for the information , and the great ( extra ) examples !, 
  loving these as well . 
  i 've never seen a series like these on the netherlands before , but i 'm interested in looking up if there is a similar development over here . 
  although a large part of my country is still very flat farmland , so i doubt it would be as striking a change . 
  it 's striking how many more huge trees there are on nearly every photo . 
  was it so barren in the past due to logging ? 
  can confirm ukrainian girls are the best !, 
  maybe it 's just the area i went out in beograd that gave me a different impression, 
  well , this exists : https://www.google.nl/search?q=silicon+valley+belgrade&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;pjf=1&amp;ved=0caoq_auoagovchmi-93rw5biyaivq9yuch1pqgkp&amp;dpr=1, 
  countries i 've been to so i can actually comment on them : croatia : great food , great landscapes , beautiful towns , left a pretty good impression . 
  would definitely visit again . 
  slovenia : reminded me of the baltics with different architecture . 
  nice place !, 
  would visit again . 
  bosnia & herzegovia : only spent a few hours in border towns . 
  people drive like madmen there . 
  would visit again just to see more . 
  serbia : good parties , depressing looks , skanky women . 
  it 's ok i guess ? 
  would visit again when i 'm in the neighbourhood . 
  bulgaria : great landscapes !, 
  good food . 
  too much shitty soviet architecture . 
  would visit again . 
  overall , interesting place , cool people in general . 
  much more interesting than anything in the netherlands . 
  if you have n't been to the area , it 's worth a trip !, 
  well , that 's a bit unfair . 
  speaking for the netherlands here , large non-european immigrant groups are deliberately remaining unemployed for benefits . 
  much * much * more so then dutch people , or , for example , polish people ( also listed in the source ) . 
  these are numbers for last year for people who have mostly lived here for a long time , so with the current number of people coming into the eu , if the trent keeps up , that 's going to be hundreds of thousands of people * chosing * to receive benefits instead of working . 
  with these kinds of numbers they might even outnumber the amount of lazy germans . 
  that 's all speculation though , this group of people might turn out to be totally different from their countrymen already living over here . 
  somalians : 68.9 % on benefits . 
  syrians : 62.2 % on benefits . 
  iraqi : 57.8 % on benefits . 
  poles : 2.1 % on benefits . 
  ( you go girl ! ), 
  dutch : 3.1 % on benefits . 
  source : centraal bureau voor de statistiek , government agency for statistics . 
  check out / r/syriancivilwar some time . 
  on the point of the chemical weapons , the official investigations into who used them were inconclusive , leaning towards the opposition being the culprit . 
  so yeah . 
  it 's been ten years since i was a student , lived in a medium sized city where supermarkets ( where i worked ) were n't open during sundays , so no 200 % pay for me ( :( ) i used to work every saturday though , got a decent pay out of it compared to my expenses so yea , i know what you mean !, 
  ah , even better . 
  and i know most people love it , employees and customers alike , except some people who are ` forced ' to work sundays , like managers of stores that used to have sundays as family days . 
  but that 's just something you get used to . 
  supply and demand . 
  students want to work since they want more money , and working on sundays pays 50 % extra . 
  i do n't see how that is ` taking advantage ' of people . 
  sunday is just another day of the week . 
  immigrants ? 
  mostly students that work in stores over here during the weekends . 
  you probably mean sanctuary, 
  no , they are n't . 
  they were just raised to think gays should be thrown from building , just like i was raised to think gays are perfectly normal human beings . 
  very impressive . 
  the last pictures , especially the facial injury ones , are tough to look at . 
  a harsh reminder that was fucking sucks . 
  indeed , this should never be forgotten . 
  it does exist , but only if you 're expected to get really tall ( they try to calculate for everyone ) . 
  an ex girlfriend of mine has a father of around 2.15 m , and her mother is 1.85 m. 
  she was expected to reach around 2 meters , which is really tall for a girl , so during puberty they gave her hormones to stop the growth . 
  she 's about 1.85 now ( i 'm 1.92 m myself , so no problem ) . 
  as i understood it , the downside to the hormones was that a few other parts of puberty , like the growth of breasts , also slows down . 
  so while she is really tall , she was also really skinny and flat chested at the time . 
  not a problem for her , but some people might be turned off of the hormone treatment by that . 
  who are you calling big , friend ? 
  [ good luck catching up ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gijpkdi.png ), 
  polls remain surprisingly unchanged since before the crisis . 
  our politicians are mostly like ` whatever man ' , in public at least . 
  these are mostly third generation immigrants in the netherlands , so it 's kind of strange to call turkey their ` home country ' . 
  all of those suffice . 
  because they act like flaming homosexuals . 
  mister roark , is that you ? 
  anecdotal , but yea . 
  due to the inner workings of the ec/eu i was quite sceptical , but brexit made me think twice . 
  the eu needs to come together , although i still think some more direct democracy wouldnt hurt . 
  the frisia region is about 8000km2 in nl , and about 2000 in de .

  those probably sound like oo-ee though . 
  the dutch sound to ` ui ' does not exist in english at all , so i ca n't even tell you what it sounds like . 
  letting google translate pronounce ` ui ' in dutch kinda works for the sound . 
  you forgot [ hellmouth ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/helmond/@51.464322,5.5983953,12.42z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c723e4aad68921:0x2514e98055565278!8m2!3d51.4792547!4d5.6570096?hl=en ), 
  if you can sit outside with just a t-shirt on it is * not * crap weather . 
  so many things about this are amazing . 
  - the turkish sounding music while this dude is pretending to play a saxophone . 
  - the freakishly tall hooker . 
  - the 51 million views - the musicians all just dancing without using their instrument . 
  - the toadlike appearance of the singer - the 51 million views ( really ? ),
