  are you fucking stupid ? 
  he said that we 'll have to learn to live with terrorism , so unless you have a pea for brain , that does not include your whole demagogic monologue . 
  unless you want to give up all of your privacy and civil freedoms by letting the government have a free pass to control each and every form of communication ( and even in this case there will still be terrorism ) you will not stop terrorism . 
  we have to learn to live with terrorist attacks if you want to keep any semblance of freedom . 
  you keep on spouting your fear mongering bullshit , while normal people will just go on with their lives after a mourning period , and not blame a single prime minister for a terrorist attack . 
  were you praising him when there were no attacks during ec 2016 ? 
  or were you busy jerking off on stormfront ? 
  seeing this bullshit of yours on this page :  there is no physical impossibility in this matter . 
  the french government , if france is indeed a sovereign nation , could do anything up to and including the expulsion from france of all who adhere to the muslim faith , in order to prevent further terrorist attacks . 
  the fact that the french government refuses to go any further than platitudes and some sporadic raids in the banlieues indicates a political choice by valls and his ilk , not a constraint of reality . 
  i 'm sorry , but seeing your opinion , i do n't even want to waste my time . 
  have fun with your dreams about expulsing all people that adhere to a single religion . 
  seeing this blatant advocating against one of the few fundamental freedoms of mankind dissuades all of my want to change your opinion . 
  if this is what you believe then we 're done . 
  i 'm ashamed to share a country with you . 
   i agree with you , but it looks like some people think that to acknowledge that terrorism will not stop means that we 've somehow given up . 
  i 'm sorry if it seemed like i attacked you , it was more attacking that sentiment you mentioned , that acknowledging it does not mean condoning it . 
   nothing could have been done with this one really . 
  the guy was alone , showed very little signs that he was radicalised . 
  had he been white , i 'm sure this would have been called the action of a lunatic . 
  yep . 
  i agree . 
  am i talking to the german population or to the people on reddit ? 
  apparently even with my long explanation you too did not get the point . 
  putting the needs of his own native ethnic people at the very bottom of his list is n't what he 's doing . 
  but clearly you 've made up your mind about how you 're ( or in case you 're another lost trump supporter ) or they 're being treated without having even a remote semblance of the complete picture . 
  flag checks out . 
  yeah i agree with you that it is probably too late to pull out of the me and hope the terrorism stops , but i would n't even consider that an option . 
  did i or pm valls say that countries should just sit back and enjoy the terrorism ? 
  no , he did n't . 
  you can try to blame the attack in nice on valls , but everyone with half a brain knows he was n't even involved in planning security for the event , and even if he ( miraculously , considering this is n't one of his jobs ) was , you can not always account for everything . 
  nobody giving him credit for the lack of terrorist attacks during the ec , but as soon as one happens he gets the blame . 
  makes sense . 
  no , his quote definitely does n't need additional context , that 's why it is received so well , right ? 
  obviously you people have no interest in searching out relevant information , and context , or even the fucking original interview . 
  because why post that one , while we can all cry and produce outrage based on a small part of a very long interview . 
  i mean , of course you do n't understand why i am twisting his words , if you have zero fucking knowledge of the rest of the interview , and if you are from all the way across the fucking pond without any context . 
  wtf is wrong with you ? 
  he is completely right in saying that we all have to learn to live with terrorism . 
  it sucks , but unless you want to give the government unprecedented power over the people , or unless all of the western governments pull out of the middle east , there will be terrorist attacks , and we all will have to learn to live with it . 
  edit : i just want to point out how funny this is : an american trying to paint valls in a bad light , and what is one of the words he uses ? 
   the people see his ** socialist ** islamist coddling policies for what they are now . 
  typical . 
  thank you !, 
  well , good for you . 
  you mind uploading a screenshot of the page if you have an online subscription ? 
  it 'll be a couple of days until i get back to the parents , and i 'm quite interested now again , i just speed read it at home . 
  it is already published if i remember correctly . 
  i think last thursday , because i 've seen something with sch\u00e4uble on the table this weekend back at my parents , but i do n't know if it was this interview , or another interview . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-06/wolfgang-schaeuble-aussenpolitik-wandel-afrika-arabische-welt ) is the short article , and i think [ here ] ( https://premium.zeit.de/aktuelle-zeit?wt_zmc=fix.int.zonpme.zon.ausgabe.ausgseite.artikel.boehm.boehm&amp;utm_medium=fix&amp;utm_source=zon_zonpme_int&amp;utm_campaign=ausgabe&amp;utm_content=ausgseite_artikel_boehm_boehm ) the full article . 
  i do n't have a zeit online subscription , my parents have the paper version , so i do n't know if it 's the correct link . 
  yes , your explanation definitely makes more sense . 
  sch\u00e4uble , the current minister of finance in germany , has never had biology in the first grade . 
  he really thinks that if germany were to stop immigration , they would result into inbreeding , with their population . 
  i 'm sorry for having read any books in my life , and developed the ability to understand metaphors in school . 
  he meant that seclusion would plummet them into ruin . 
  ( or instead of ruin , put in any negative result , such as : shambles ), 
  so you 're critizing this guy exactly for what he was saying ? 
  jesus christ i am getting more and more disappointed by the level of literacy here . 
   abschottung w\u00fcrde uns in inzucht degenerieren lassen this is what he said , the op translated this like this :  seclusion would plummet us into inbred so now , the word ` inzucht ' , used by sch\u00e4uble , is translated here with ` inbred ' . 
  a literal translation , which is a good job , because you do n't want to ruin the style when translating . 
  so sch\u00e4uble said : seclusion would plummet us into inbred . 
  he did n't mean inbred literally , sch\u00e4uble is no dumb fuck that does not understand first grade biology , he did not mean that people will go out on the streets and fuck their mothers , sisters and dads immediately after seclusion . 
  he meant that seclusion would plummet them into ruin ( you could try to interpret maybe with : depravity , shambles etc ) . 
  that is what a metaphor is , was that good enough for you ? 
  that 's not true at all , and you 're misrepresenting his words . 
   we do n't actually need so much growth anymore ( growth of economy ) . 
  let us make the rising economies of the south stronger . 
  he is not saying at all that we should forget our own growth for the southern countries , he is saying that we do not ** need ** to grow our economy alone , let us grow the rising economies of the south . 
  if you had read the whole interview ( which you probably did n't because judging by your attitude on altruism ) , you would see that his point is that by growing these economies , you basically grow your own because now you can export more to these people , who have grown wealthier . 
  basic stuff . 
  instead of harping on about the inbreeding comment of his , which for fuck 's sake is a figure of speech , how about you comment on its contents ? 
  i 'm sorry , what do you mean with your comment ? 
  i do n't follow . 
  there are things called figures of speech . 
  figures of speech . 
  there are 3 german flairs in this thread , one just helped with the translation , the other one posted some research about inbreeding related to space colonies/spacefaring . 
  and the last one comments about the date of this article . 
  everyone else is referencing the translated article , and instead of commenting on it 's substance you 're all shocked about the word inbreeding . 
  who 's being dramatic here ? 
  and i did post elsewhere in this thread , sadly i 'm 4 hours too late to salvage it . 
  ladies and gentlemen , the state of / r/europe . 
  no one that understands figures of speech , and instead of discussing his content everybody freaks out about some mention of inbreeding . 
  holy shit you are taking his words literally ? 
  do n't you people have literature in school ? 
  you seriously think he means inbreeding in the literal sense of the word ? 
  where the fuck did you get eugenics out of this piece ? 
  jfc , some people just want to argue for the sake of arguing . 
  at least argue some of his points , instead of rambling on about his figures of speech . 
  from the dutch guy who translated this piece :  facing the migration from crisis zones of the middle east and africa : `` one thing is clear about the future : we will have to invest more in iraq , in syria and in libya und after that we will have to pay more for the development of the sub-saharan countries . 
  then we can finaly open up the market . 
  the north africans expect this from us , in return for keeping the immigrants back . 
  it 's their respectfull right , is n't it ? '', 
   he was humored at the g7 by colleagues , when he said : `` actually we do n't need to grow that much anymore . 
  we should help to grow the southern economies faster . 
  it rubs some of them the wrong way , when i say this . '', 
   the rich countries should make more effort to compensate the disadvantaged countries . 
  `` the task of the globalised world will be , another revolution , a fundamental change without exaggeration '' , according to sch\u00e4uble . 
  he is not advocating for mass-immigration from africa , he dismisses the notion of inhibiting immigration , and then justifies that seclusion is wrong , and then says how the western countries should focus on making smaller economies grow faster , instead of always making your own bigger and better . 
   this was tried since the end of wwii , with the very mixed results we have today .
