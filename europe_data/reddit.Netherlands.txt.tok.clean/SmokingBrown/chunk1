   cheese-eating surrender monkeys couldnt you just have said , frenchies ? 
  you think you 're the only one that plays this way ? 
  its basic football , people already accounted for all of this during their time as an amateur in the youth teams . . its the execution that matters . 
  but i think its not that , its the player whom play in the own league and almost never play together . . how many are that ? 
  how many on average per team ? 
  3 maybe ?

  they actually are part of the kingdom of the netherlands and are not just colonies . 
  surinam is/was a colony , those islands are actually dutch territories . 
  look it up on wikipedia . 
  but , you 're right , too small to see . 
  i just like to moan about pointless shit . 
  how the fuck did they remember that but not curacao , bonaire & sint maarten . 
  all are dutch territories .

  no no no no , we have ammo !,

   coffee definitely has an impact on your bowels , but if you drink it regularly you get use to it of course . 
  coffee is also just like smoking pretty addictive . 
  well if it was just the shits i could maybe handle it for a little while to get used to . 
  alright , thanks . 
  yeah i smoke so i smell like an ashtray , that , i knew haha . 
  yeah , its better than the alternative for me , it gives me unbelievable shits . 
  or just dont drink coffee . 
  and i dont know if im right or not ( too lazy to google , sue me ) but coffeebreath actually comes from the stomach , i believe . 
  til something good came out of rotterdam . 
  ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ kidding . 
  ^ ^ ^ stop ^ ^ ^ foaming . 
   or chew on raw coffee beans . 
  coffeebreath intensifies . 
  `` our '' kapsalon ?

   texas but ** i 'll fight you anyways ** . 
  how am i not surprised . 
   legal protections need to be in place or the cleverer or least gullible of the two will always come out on top in case of a breakup . 
  lol in my experience it doesnt matter how clever or non-gullible you are , most judges will agree and rule in favor of the fake-crying boobs . 
   for me , personally , marriage is a man and a woman living together . 
  so because of her ( and her party 's ) personal feelings the majority of the country is being ignored ? 
  76 % is a pretty big majority . 
  because thats the meme , and we all speak it . 
  because you did `` everything '' in your power and still failed to join the eu . 
  while on the other hand we 'd ( the people of / r/europe ) welcome mexico with open arms and turkey not so much perhaps ? 
   you think you 're smart , but you really are just a stooge who ca n't figure anything . 
  lol , this in combination with the flag had me in tears . 
   you do n't know the ~ ~ joy ~ ~ pain of saying something like that as a turk in / r/europe . 
  its okay buddy . 
  you tried . 
  are they at it already ? 
  usually they come ` round easter . 
  suck it , finland . 
  you mean like how ` uwe poep ' doesnt mean ` your shit ' but ` your ass/behind ' ? 
  cool , got it thnx . 
  i know but otherwise the `` joke '' doesnt stick . 
  pa & ma . 
  gave ya a nostalgic feeling there ? 
  yeah i tried to search buddy , maybe you can google better than me but i give up . 
  it was in de tweede kamer i believe . . dont know for sure , browsed through a couple of clips myself but cant seem to find it . 
  i did find [ this article ] ( http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/39681/nbsp/article/detail/4376391/2016/09/14/kamer-keert-zich-tegen-kuzu.dhtml ) though which suggests about the same . 
  lol i dont lol know lol do you lol always lol speak like lol this lol ? 
  what are you ? 
  dont you have people to rip off in knight online ? 
  i 'll vote for de piratenpartij just because none of the bigger parties seem to get it . 
  wilders does but is just shouting random problems ( most i believe , are true though ) without having a good , well thought out solution for it . 
  it really is , they once caught him saying ` my president doesnt allow this ' to which another councilmember ( from a different party ) said ` we dont have a president here . 
  to whom are you reffering ? ', 
  and he went silent . 
  so i guess thats a yes , they really are pro-erdogan . 
  nah probably not , every turk speaks japanese . 
  you know they 're going to come for your chinese cartoons aswell eh . 
  too much kawaii oppai , unclean . 
  the first belgians were named ; pa tat & ma yonaise .
