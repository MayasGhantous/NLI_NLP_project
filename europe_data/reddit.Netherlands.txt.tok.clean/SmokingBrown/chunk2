  ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding < 3, 
  then i 'd advice them to go learn basic english before traveling abroad like everybody else does . 
   and i ca n't say for all of my countrymen , but for some of them it might be not easier to understand for you if they try to speak in english . 
  i 'd rather have somebody speaking broken english i can understand a little than speaking french which i absolutley can not understand except for a few words . 
  ~ ~ no thats not beyond stupid . 
  french is not a common language spoken by almost everybody like it is with english . 
  i dont come to your country asking for help in dutch do i ? 
  first thing i ask is parlevous anglais ? 
  ( or however you write that ) if you dont merci , bye . 
  its called not being selfabsorbed when asking for help . ~ ~ wow . . 
  i am stupid . 
  yes , you are correct . 
  damned brainfart moments lately . 
  i 'll leave my stupidity up for the shame it deserves . 
  no , no im seriously not . 
  i was taking a well known concept ( atleast in my country ) and forged it into a \\* joke * . 
  although i have to admit that sometimes i did send them the wrong way , but those were special cases who absolutley refused to reply in english while understanding it perfectly . 
  and i dont only do this to french people , every nationality is fair game if they refuse to speak english while im trying to help them . 
  its just mostly french whom refuse though . 
  a frenchman speaking english ... is the world ending already ? 
  i thought none of them spoke english . 
  atleast they dont/refuse when they ask for directions here in the netherlands . 
  guess who 's gon na get sent to the middle of nowhere . 
  yep , nice job pointing out whats wrong with people and the world in general . 
   wilders wants people of a certain descent out of the country , ** no matter the qualification , legal status or criminal offense record . 
  ** ehm , first off i dont vote for the guy . 
  but the bold part is not quite true , atleast it wasnt a while back while i was still paying attention . 
  if he did change it to that and people are still voting for him ... well . . lets not go into that . 
  he always said if you want to participate in dutch society , great , you 're welcome . 
  but if you screw it up for other people ( criminal behaviour and what not ) you can just fucking leave . 
  i 'd like to close my statement with once again , ** no i dont vote for the guy but we should be honest here . 
  ** edit ; am dutch . 
  forgot to mention . 
  ok . . in that case i think its apalt imo . 
  its not gender related as much as it is human related imo . 
  awalt ? 
  care to explain to a noob who hasnt hear of these terms so i can understand your comment a bit better ? 
  that doesnt make me feel better at all . 
  thats going to be a strain on your people , and i do like your people . 
  just not the ones in charge . 
  and im not from germany im from the netherlands , maybe you had dutch and deutsch confused ? 
   there are multiple eu countries that are n't part of the ez . 
  while true , most of them joined after the introduction of the euro and we 've learned from our mistakes . 
   that 's a very extreme reaction , though . 
  yes , im still extremly salty for the amounts of money we couldve used for better infrastructure , better healthcare etc to you guys . 
   also , most of the loaned money came from the imf which works on an international scale independently from the eu . 
  first click on google ;  dutch government lends greece 11.9 billion euros https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/background/2015/09/dutch-government-lends-greece-11-9-billion-euros that certainly didnt come from the imf . 
  11.9 billion , hello . 
   our eu membership has little to do with it . 
  if you werent part of the eu you also wouldnt be in the ez and we wouldnt have to give you all that money . 
  yeah , maybe but sorry for bringing this up but i wish countries like yours werent part of it . 
  hundreds of millions ( maybe even billions ) of hardworking taxpayer euro 's went your way and we 'll never see that back . 
  i believe i once even saw a video of one of your candidates ( maybe even prime minister now ? 
  i dont know , didnt keep up to date since i was raging every time the news was about greece ) saying he wasnt going to because he simply didnt want to . 
  thats only one of the things i dont like about the eu . 
  sorry i had to use your country for this comment , no hard feelings towards your people really , but the people who run your country . 
  none , but i 've seen a lot of female `` dictator supporters '' if you will . 
  most even more fanatic than their male counterparts . 
  just because they 're not in power , doesnt mean they dont matter . 
  edit ; the comment i replied to said something like this ;  `` what kind of question is this ? 
  have you ever seen a female dictator ? '', 
  something like that , if the commentor sees this and knows exactly what he/she said , correct me if im wrong please . 
   disappointed ** men ** of one sort or the other why only men if i may ask ? 
  edit ; whoa , apparantley i may not ask this question , holy crap . 
  sorry for asking a question that wouldve given me extra insight on your opinion . 
  / r/europe is not / r/ilovetheeuropeanunion ... 
  i dont like much of the union but i like europe . 
  so is [ this ] ( http://www.openmonumentendag.nl/w/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/3758-utrecht-domtoren.jpg ) but i think that qualifies as a building aswell . 
  thanks for this usefull reply , til a bit more english who wouldve thought at the age of 31 . 
  i 've been calling these ** structures ** buildings for forever . 
  okay ... so what does that make the eiffel tower ? 
  a construction with a restaurant ? 
  so is the eiffel tower ? 
  or am i interpreting the word buildings wrong here ? 
  lol ? 
  eiffel tower in france is 300m so why on earth would you pick a 250m one over a 300m one ... 
  yeah i also dont use it as a disagree button since it goes against the reddiquette but whatever , people will always do what they want . 
  nice talking to you buddy , have a nice day !, 
  haha no worries buddy theyre just some useless internetpoints i dont really care . 
  didnt think it was you aswell ( after your reply atleast ) or your tone mightve been different , you came across pretty understanding to me . 
  thats okay my english skills arent 100 % either , i was just a little confused about it . 
  thanks for clearing it up . 
  i agree with that but thats not what you said in your first post . 
  you were talking about academies . 
  dont you mean players ? 
  best academies in the world are 1 . 
  afc ajax 2 . 
  not in that specific order but those are generally the top 3 . 
  ~ ~ edit ; well excuse me for trying to correct you in a proper way . ~ ~, 
  you should visit / r/trolluniversity more often and try to pick up the slack . 
  this made me laugh , perhaps even more so than you . 
  wow , you 're an easy follower . 
  edit ; when are you planning to start btw ? 
  not that i care , but my points are still the same . 
  or did you just want to sound cool ? 
  ahhh okay , i was t r i g g e r d there for a while . . 
  thanks again . 
  ah and this is such a case where you cant differentiate ? 
  what the hell . . why does your flair say nazi netherlands ? 
  just noticed it on mobile , is this because of erdogans remarks or is some mod actually convinced we 're nazis ?
