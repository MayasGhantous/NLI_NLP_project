i 'm not that tall . 
  you do realize i included people who voted against brexit in my 90 % ? 
  and it 's not that it 's incomprehensible , it 's that people do not take the time to learn about it . 
  then they get lied about literally everything about the eu by the people that are supposed to represent them , they take those lies as facts and act on them . 
  it 's how democracy works nowadays . 
  i dare bet 90 % of the people who voted in the brexit referendum had absolutely no idea what they were actually voting for . 
  i 'm pretty sure the guy thought it was funny i could n't understand shit aswell . 
  i once tried to hold a conversation with an irish guy in ireland . 
  mistake . 
  i disagree . 
  how cool would it be if all of italy just got buttblasted by their [ earthquake lines ] ( http://static.temblor.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rieti-italy-earthquake-5a.jpg ) . 
  it could be our own little spot to have a fancy post apocalyptic holiday . 
   there is no liberal islam . 
  using absolutes like that is n't going to help anyone . 
  fuck you finland, 
  i 'd do one for the netherlands , but turns out half the results end in `` so expensive '' . 
  this hurts, 
  i 'm going to assum they did n't include [ canals ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ikqzobv.png ) . 
  he should work on his stance though . 
  i recommend the [ nicolas cage power stance \u2122 ] ( http://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/review/primary_image/reviews/knowing-2009/homepage_eb20090318reviews903189991ar.jpg ) . 
  the fuck is f 81 30 supposed to mean ? 
  give back new york pls amerifats, 
  press f to pay your respects to democratic turkey . 
  exactly . 
  how can the uk decide what 's best for scotland ? 
  they 're literally being forced out of something they want to stay in . 
  where 's their sovereignity , their independence ? 
  co-funded , not co-founded . 
  it 's like stealing the nightwatch , or the mona lisa . 
  worth many hundreds of millions , but at the same time impossible to sell . 
  they 're very nice birds . 
  it 's going to kinda look like ... [ something ] ( https://www.deltares.nl/app/uploads/2016/04/visualisatie-marker-wadden-ontwerp-boskalis-735x525.jpg ) ? 
  rate our new [ piece of land ] ( http://nos.nl/data/image/2016/09/24/320252/864x486.jpg ) . 
  if you got glasses on , you can always take them off . 
  if you 're wearing lenses for example and are at a passport control with your passport having glasses , then you 'd have to go find your glasses and put them on . 
  if they 're different glasses since you got new ones , it might still look wildly different . 
  they can do this because they got billions back by leaving the eu . 
  ofcourse it used to be water . 
  it 's the same as those state-sanctioned demonstrations where people are `` allowed to demonstrate from 12:00 untill 13:45 on this specific area of this town '' . 
  it goes against the whole idea of a demonstration . 
  yeah i dunno , i live in the amsterdam west . 
  i can vividly remember seeing it , but you rarely ever see them . 
  these women rarely leave their houses , i assume . 
  the things are scary as fuck to be honest . 
  just like a guy running around in a ski mask or helmet with a black visor . 
  i got really fucking uncomfortable the last time i saw it ( which was like 6 years ago ) . 
  turkey preparing for war with camouflage . 
   70 of the killed reindeer were calves did this crack anyone else up ? 
  like the crime of the lightning bolt is significantly worse because it also killed calves !, 
  on the plus-side , i 've always wanted to see england . 
  technically that 's not europe . 
  fluitjes are better than humpen . 
  oh well , off to the next torrentsite . 
  i was wondering why so many torrents were removed from kat.ph . 
  because they are shit cities . 
  ... did n't [ 55 % ] ( https://www.stratfor.com/sites/default/files/styles/stratfor_full/public/main/images/brexit-result.png?itok=dvsnvu9q ) of wales vote to leave ... ? 
  it was pretty much a death threat . 
  i had to google it . 
  after seeing where it is , i 'm still not convinced it exists . 
  wow north africa has a weird name for tea, 
  i sware m8 if u keep takin my jobs ill fukken gob u, 
  it 's always the fucking poles is n't it . 
  well , you started it . 
  did you lose all your ability to bant with the brexit ? 
  with the way the pound is going soon no brits can pay for internet anymore . 
  it 'll be heaven . 
  i enjoy asking people for stuff they ca n't provide . 
  explain . 
  maybe if we bribe them our rating can go up . 
  back to the donald with you , little trumpling, 
  to be honest i feel like every single eu benefit is overlooked . 
  tfw we 're bullied, 
  he 's just like the little kid in this video . 
  you hit the nail on it 's head . 
  we 're basically english speaking . 
  it 's mainly the people who have no idea what they 're voting for that want out . 
  why do so many english politicians who were lobbying for brexit now proclaim `` no hurry guys !, 
  well there you go . 
  the eu and the euro are great ideas , but you got ta be a bit more strict about who you 're letting in . 
  you could look at it that way aswell . 
  but there 's numerous countries that have n't been allowed in the eurozone because they did n't meet criteria . 
  i have no idea how a country like greece managed to meet these criteria . 
  yeah , me neither . 
  and it 's still a strong coin everything considered . 
  the problem with the euro is that too many countries were allowed to use it that have fucking shit economies . 
  muslims pray loudly . 
  doing that in public will in part be them showing everybody `` look im muslim and you should be too '' . 
  opening prayer rooms in schools is mixing religion and education . 
  honestly trying to force your religion upon other people , which is exactly what it is when you try to force your school into opening dedicated prayer rooms or pray in pbulic spaces on school , is not really trying to assimilate into a society . 
  same , but i still expect these same people to besides keeping their culture also find a way to assimilate into the society of the country their living in instead of refusing to because `` that 's not my culture !, 
   `` one should n't be allowed to force things on others , but there should n't be others who force things on me [ like saying ] that i should follow danish culture and not pray , '' she said . 
  i live here , but i do n't want to assimilate myself in this society and you should respect that !, 
  weird how `` being deported '' is a good thing here . 
  when are we going to declare war on the swiss !?!, 
  het is patat !, 
  people are so stupid . 
  taxes are the definition of socialism . 
  everybody chips in to make sure a certain service is provided by the government . 
  it 's why its utterly ridiculous that people have such animosity for `` socialism '' . 
  also the american army is funded by socialist means .
