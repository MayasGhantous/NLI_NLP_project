  at the very least i 've been taught wat a gigantic shithole the us is . 
  it 's just like china . 
  a lot of things i consume get made there , but i 'm really fucking glad i do n't live in that shithole . 
  besides funny , it 's also really convenient to live in a country that 's not a third world country . 
  you could 've joined if your country was n't so shit . 
  fucking nature , we 're basically one big city . 
  how are we supposed to score high on nature ? 
  that 's like calling the portuguese spanish . 
  you 're irish . 
  now comes the monkey out of the sleeve !, 
  uuuuussseed to beeeeee, 
  why is n't the vaalserberg on here ? 
  dozens !, 
  i 'm sure the sample sizes in this particular research were too small to accurately reflect the real data . 
  the finns were so afraid of us they did n't dare participate !, 
  what a victory !, 
  he 's got times under 6 , why is his average so high ? 
  and yet 99 % of the people watching it will feel it to be referring to white people . 
  if you made it about black supremacists or asian supremacists or whatever other supremacists there are people would shit their pants because these would be immedeatly associated with their respective races aswell . 
  but what am i saying , the video is dehumanizing white people and you ca n't be racist to white people , right . 
  thousands seems like a bit of an understatement . 
  how the fuck is the rijksmuseum a tourist destination ? 
  why would you comment on an article before reading it ? 
  this is literally the first sentence : `` the 30-year-old played beethoven 's ode to joy as an unscripted encore '', 
  [ rain gear ] ( https://images.hema.nl/products/regenpak-voor-volwassenen-34471392-listermain.jpg ) . 
  also bring an extra shirt because you 'll sweat like fucking crazy in that thing . 
  now do one of the netherlands !, 
  yeah , it 's really sad to see turkey slide down this hill faster and faster . 
  at this point i 'm honestly even convinced the coup was either orchestrated by erdogan or allowed . 
  would you also find it cool if every time you checked out at the supermarket you had to stand at attention to whatever leaders portrait is on the wall there ? 
  so basically forcefully reinforcing his false narrative with the ultimate goal of bamboozling enough turks to effectively take control of the country with a majority supporting him and his every move ? 
  i thought mine was obviously a bit deeper than that . 
  but what if you identify as an unidentified militia ? 
  spoken like a true russian . 
  it 's because he 's a trumpdrone, 
  the words of a true russian . 
  stopped the album when i saw you included your fucking pencil in the second picture . 
  i do n't want to see your pencil , i want to see the picture . 
  stop this . 
  bidets just are n't practical in countries where the average temperature is n't 20 + degrees celsius . 
  water is cold , you know . 
  it also gets everywhere . 
  voldemort disagrees, 
  we 've got [ this thing ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.3784451,4.790608,3a,75y,174.9h,86.74t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1six3kmkrxdjvxm9h0a9faiw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) in my neighbourhood that 's supposed to have vegetation all over it . 
  highest the vegetation has ever gotten was maybe halfway i think . 
  yea but half of it is uninhabitable white desert, 
  why do n't you guys empty your lakes so you have more land, 
  you started defending beats , which are scientifically and factually bad headphones . 
  ask any person who 's knowledgable about this and they 'll answer exactly the same , that they 're shit . 
  the only reason it gets sold is because of the marketing machine behind it . 
  here 's some articles with a more neutral writing style : http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2013/05/are-beats-by-dr-dre-headphones-worth-the-money/index.htm http://time.com/74886/best-headphones/?utm_source=huffingtonpost.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=pubexchange_article and here 's a friendly black guy explaining why beats really are n't worth it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxqxs0adby, 
  and all the other people who use headphones that came with their phones do n't have a valid opinion on headphones either . 
  wow , you scanned those amazon pages pretty fucking quickly . 
  impressive . 
   i did n't care about the sound quality how the fuck ca n't you care about the soundquality of your headphones ? 
  it also completely invalidates your opinion on headphones in general . 
   there are n't any good alternatives or you simply have n't bothered looking for any good alternatives . 
  here 's some : https://www.amazon.com/headphones-bluetooth-electronics/s?ie=utf8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3a172541%2cp_n_feature_four_browse-bin%3a12097501011, 
  this article goes in quite some detail of how bad beats headphones are . 
  they 're horrible headphones, 
  i 'm including the students here aswell , among students i 'm pretty sure more people smoke weed than the average . 
  amsterdam , being a city with a lot of students , should be a bit higher than average aswell . 
  i guarantee that a significant part of the weed smokers you saw in amsterdam were tourists . 
  granted , there is a significant part of the natives in amsterdam that smoke weed aswell , but it 's not really representative for the rest of the country . 
  http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/2133/23830818/1383592391317/shrinking+palestine.jpg that 's all . 
  [ we got you mate .

  you can have up to 5 plants here for private use . 
  it 's legal to sell in coffeeshops , but obviously those coffeeshops ca n't legally bulkbuy weed to sell . 
  so they have to illegally acquire weed to then legally sell it . 
  suck it finland !, 
  remember , the palestinians are the bad guys . 
  swimming in the canals in any dutch cities generally is n't recommended . 
  the netherlands should probably change to `` it 's compliated '' . 
  i wish those cunts in the government just legalized it any fucking time soon . 
  we 're not even taxing it right now . 
  and atleast they had an ethos . 
  yeah , well , ours [ throws toilets ] ( http://static1.persgroep.net/parool/image/e4431d19-8495-45fc-815f-d61f46214015?width=664&amp;height=374 ), 
  actually , this seems more what he meant : https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6he0um/london_tower_block_fire_teenager_calls_conspiracy/ and honestly there 's some truth to it . 
  those tenants were n't making anyone money . 
  feels bad , man :(, 
  so if they powerwashed it , it would suddenly turn white ? 
  like regular smoking you do it on spots that does n't get the smoke into everyones faces . 
  like parks and stuff . 
  sometimes a bench near a canal . 
  or coffeeshops obviously . 
  but you do n't fucking smoke in the middle of 150 people on the kinkerstraat because we 're living in a fucking society and are not savages . 
  more is better !, 
  not as good as the netherlands . 
  also they had that one sniper guy who was on a rampage in wwii . 
  and litmanen . 
  you 're also supposed to bring your own toilet paper . 
  finland ? 
  more like fatland . 
  i thought it was hilarious . 
  he 's dying and does n't have any fucks left to give . 
  in one of his rehearsal he suddenly started playing mouthtrumpet aswell . 
  like a 10 year old throwing a hissyfit because his mom does n't buy him an icecream . 
  because the first step inthat article is literally `` study hard '' .
