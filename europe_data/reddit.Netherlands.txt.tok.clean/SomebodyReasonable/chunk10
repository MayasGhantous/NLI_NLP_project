  people are virtually helpless against russian propaganda . 
  they would rather blame ukraine or their own government . 
  that 's how powerful it is . 
  it bothers me , to be honest . 
  in the short term , there was anger and indignation over mh 17 , but russian propaganda proxies win out in the long term . 
  do n't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya . 
   i absolutely do . 
   no , you do n't . 
   self proclaimed expert . 
  i have no idea of your qualifications of course . 
  you can tell by the fact that i can answer deeply technical questions , while referencing sources , and you ca n't . 
   nice . 
  though you never actually provided proof that the linked article was anything related to gchq and i did n't have to , nor am i interested to , because , as i 've said many times now , from my experience , i know isps have backdoor access to cpes . 
   you just gave a lot of hyperbole and bluster and how you 're qualified to post while few others are . 
  this underscores again why you should have left a while ago . 
   nothing of substance i 'm afraid . 
  you 're talking to an expert ; if you 're going to assail that expert , while gleefully admitting you have no qualifications whatsoever in the field , no experience , no knowledge of the technical intricacies involved , yet you deride that expert as `` deluded '' and try to paint him as a `` conspiracy theorist '' incessantly , you can expect me to rip you a fucking new one . 
  the last people in this world right now to batter people for alleged `` conspiracy theorism '' are the americans and the brits , and especially people trying to defend gchq of all organizations . 
  and drop the `` have a nice day '' nonsense -- you do n't mean it . 
   people are complaining that he should 've been found `` not guilty '' because of his claim that his computer was remotely controlled by a third party . 
  this is ludicrous . 
  not really . 
  hundreds of thousands of computers , perhaps millions , are being remotely controlled by botnets right this minute . 
  either judiciaries around the world start dealing with this fact or they acquit in case of doubt . 
  what 's more , when you have an ip-address in your logs , you do n't necessarily have proof the operator behind the computer in question is your suspect . 
   if we accept that premise , then no one can ever be convicted of a crime perpetrated via a computer ; then so be it . 
  the principle of innocent until proven guilty is paramount . 
  you 'll have to catch the perp in the act . 
   it 's literally impossible to prove that his computer was not remotely controlled . 
  i do n't think the prosecutor ought to be expected to prove a negative , you 're right . 
  this relates to my next point :  the people complaining about this have a completely skewed idea of how law works . 
  and conversely , there is a long and sordid history of judges who do not understand how it works , and therefore , are unable to assess the value of expert opinion heard in court . 
  so what i want to know is what the court did with the expert assessment of jacob applebaum . 
   do i agree that gchq aims to take complete authority over peoples lives , as you say `` ruthlessly totalitarian ''  no i do not then i was right after all , of course . 
  complete destruction of privacy *** is *** taking complete authority over people 's lives . 
   their close partners like five eyes who work closely with them and i 've yet to hear any of them complain about gchq . 
  why would they ? 
   na you 're taking my last remark entirely out of context ; i do n't find networking hard . 
  you just have n't got any qualifications in the field and do n't know anything about it . 
   it 's not attractive / u/somebodyreasonable to say the least . 
  i do n't care , / u/winkwinknudge _ nudge ;-)  perhaps conspiracy theorists should stop trying to draw conclusions and labels things as fact i 'll stop you right there . 
  i am speaking from my own experience working for a large isp , and what 's more , i 'm speaking to a belligerent nitwit who is trying to paint facts that have been in the public domain for a year now ( mass surveillance disclosures ) as conspiracy theorist material . 
   they should also drop the silly emotive hyperbole they 're quick to spout out like orwellian nah . 
   and totalitarian or whatever the word of the day is and maybe they 'd be taken a little more seriously . 
  nobody needs to be taken seriously by the likes of you . 
  what we need is simply to outnumber you . 
   i mean there 's a dedicated sub for this sort of thing afterall . 
  no , the go-to dossier is at the guardian : http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nsa this just in :  `` we now know that data from any call , internet search , or website you visited over the past two years could be stored in gchq 's database and analysed at will , all without a warrant to collect it in the first place , '' said deputy director eric king . 
  `` it is outrageous that the government thinks mass surveillance , justified by secret `` arrangements '' that allow for vast and unrestrained receipt and analysis of foreign intelligence material is lawful . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/29/gchq-nsa-data-surveillance you 're one of the more pathetic denialists i 've come across . 
  i should have added an / s. 
  i was imitating the mobster intimidation routine , if you know what i mean . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzkuozrbl4#t=1m45s no , of course i think we ca n't stay out of this ; i think we should go help ukraine militarily , right now . 
   *** where westerners today habitually divide nations into democracies and dictatorships and decide their attitudes to them on that basis , putin treats them all the same , considering their domestic arrangements to be something for them to worry about . 
  *** http://russia-insider.com/en/politics_ukraine_opinion/2014/10/31/03-27-48pm/putin_just_made_most_important_speech_his_career_west what the everliving fuck ? 
  what do the ruskies take us for ? 
   *** putin believes that the use of force by the coup-imposed government in kiev means that it 's actually a junta . 
  *** http://rt.com/news/154560-putin-junta-ukraine-attack/, 
   you seem to be suffering from ` lack of context ' syndrome . 
  ironically , diagnosing ideological opponents with `` syndromes '' is a typical ussr-tactic . 
   the comment i was replying to was specifically about communism . 
   i really do n't care for getting into a big argument about the intricacies of modern freedom and surveillance . 
  of course not , your position is untenable . 
  the uk is on a slippery slope towards soft totalitariansm or `` totalitarian democracy '' . 
  we should kick you out of the eu first thing . 
  that 's what you want , anyway . 
   wow , you 're deluded . 
  i 'm not deluded , you 're ignorant . 
   again you 're barking up the wrong tree there . 
  never said anything along the lines of `` that 's what they do '' . 
  merely asked what reputation they had to defend . 
  no reason to be so hostile / u/somebodyreasonable . 
  then surely , you agree that ghcq has been exposed as ruthlessly totalitarian and almost unconstrained in what they can do , by the snowden leaks . 
  the amount of reputation damage done to the gchq is irreparable , yes ? 
   again , there 's no evidence to support the link or that the backdoor is even for that intent there is an orgy of evidence for `` backdooring intent '' of all sorts of devices on the part of gchq . 
   so it 's just a silly conspiracy theory . 
  mass surveillance is now a conspiracy fact , though , the `` conspiracy theorists '' were right , and silly denialists were wrong . 
   is it hard hard to understand ? 
  i mean really ... 
  yes , i think networking technology is very `` hard hard '' for sciolists and nitwits . 
  which is why they should move on to topics more in their league , like geordie shore or britain 's next top model . 
  isps have backdoor access to your router/modem . 
  fact . 
  intelligence services and government can and will compel isps to cooperate . 
  fact . 
   welcome to the internet . 
  thanks !, 
   did n't realise i should n't have posted something which contradicted what you were saying . 
  correct , you do n't post something if you 're wholly and utterly ignorant of the technical subject matter . 
   let the circlejerk continue , my liege . 
  ah , you 're a troll , i see . 
   i did n't apologie for them i said `` what reputation did they have '' when you said they 've damaged it . 
  you were asking a rhetorical question , defending the gchq with the well-familiar `` that is what spies do '' talking point . 
  it 's a big yawner . 
   from what i 've seen most of europe is working with the nsa . 
  and it is shameful . 
  you mean linking to a credible website , rather than the likes of conspiracy theories . 
  cryptome is pretty credible , but as i said , i was discussing from my own experience . 
  something you wish to avoid discussing , because you are out of your depth and you know it . 
   you find it understandable to establish a link where there is n't one the only organization capable of such mass backdooring operations in the uk is the gchq .
