  the deflators that we use , differentiated by equivalized income , are the keys needed to release the changes in economic welfare locked in the observed changes in nominal incomes . 
   *** we find a clear and overwhelming economic bonus on average for east germans -- a point which is to be expected . 
  *** a large part of the story of postwall economic reconstruction is those who have suffered a unification malus , understood here as a negative present-value of annual differences between the course of actual income and a counterfactual forecast of income in a frozen gdr . 
  *** about 19 % of the east german population older than 25 in 1990 and who remained in the sample until 1998 is identified as having experienced a unification malus . 
  *** inspection of figure 5 reveals that the aggregate unification malus is only about one-tenth the size of the aggregate unification bonus ( seen by comparing the dark areas to the left and right of the zero line ) . 
   we have also found that in contrast to what has been observed in other economies in transition from the old socialist order , elderly east germans have gained much more than other age groups . 
  indeed for all intents and purposes , our sample of east german elderly survived the fall of communism in a way that both helmut kohl and vilfredo pareto could score as an improvement in economic welfare . 
  at the other end of the bonus distribution , the smallest average unification bonus is found for women between the ages of 35 and 44 at the time of german unification . 
  thirty percent of that group is identified as unification `` losers . '' http://www.e-jei.org/upload/w8t1123g2712p127.pdf the key questions here , of course , are : * is a 19 % segment of the 1989 population older than 25 having seen deterioration in their economic situation acceptable ? 
  * these `` deflators '' , are they tailored to satisfy the clear confirmation biases of the researchers ? 
  who knows , all i know is , 19 % of almost all adults screwed over by the transition is n't something i would `` sign up '' for . 
  and i would prefer going to german sources anyway . 
  these are all english , what do they know . 
  would n't want to rely on english sources for research into my own country either . 
  the erroneous assumptions foreigners make , even academics , are often overwhelming . 
  correlation does n't mean causation . 
  i 'm not even sure there is a correlation ; if one looks at the scandinavian model , or , conversely , the u.s. and large scale financial fraud and corruption there . 
   when chavez got cancer he blamed it on the usa and a lot of people bought into it . 
  when arafat died israel was blamed and we know now they were right . 
  without evidence i 'm not going to believe chavez was irradiated or poisoned but it 's not beyond the pentagon or the cia to do such things . 
  in putin 's case , please do poison or irradiate the fucker . 
  also : remember what was done to yushchenko : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viktor_yushchenko#dioxin_poisoning, 
  i frequently see romanians comparing erdogan to caucescu . 
  do you agree with this comparison ? 
  yes , exactly , that 's what i meant . 
  well , i think capitalism has its benefits , but when i said what i said just now , i also have , for example , portugal and greece in mind , both of whom are suffering greatly under austerity measures . 
  the deficit norm of the european union has become the cudgel for neoliberalist reform . 
  west germany was also intended to be this shining example of the american way , the free market , to entice eastern germans to flee their country or demand an improvement in living standards . 
  the cold war obviously involved economic warfare , too . 
  you ca n't be an attractive place to live for eastern germans if you have a society which treats its citizens like worthless wage slaves . 
  after the wall fell ? 
  who gives a fuck ? 
  capitalism won , let 's go all the way . 
  time to unleash the savagery of `` free market efficiency '' on the masses . 
  efficiency meaning to work ever more hours for ever less pay , steady erosions of employee rights , etc. 
   so if someone sat next to you on the bus said after sneezing that they had ebola and then ran off would you laugh ? 
  i would laugh , but in principle because i 've just witnessed a prankster confusing the symptoms from the common cold with those from ebola . 
  i would say that currently , capitalism is failing eastern germany . 
  and the rest of us too , by the way . 
  back when the iron curtain stood , it represented an incentive to neoliberalists to maintain a proper social safety net , distribute the wealth , to not privatize everything , to savor unions and to emphasize the need for a proper living wage . 
  there 's no need for that any longer . 
  i 've always stood in awe of my fellow countrymen 's desire to have democracy and justice destroyed so that a few petty grievances can be dealt with . 
  how about we set an example that we do n't accept ever-increasing repression from governments ? 
  i remember when the joke = jail nonsense began . 
  creeping normalcy has even gotten people to defendz this draconian nonsense . 
  we need a way out of the post-9 / 11 madness . 
   just because russians are appropriating russian ethnic territories it does n't mean that europe is in danger . 
  `` russian ethnic territories '' is a fictional concept . 
  you 're talking about ukrainian land . 
  `` appropriating '' is a euphemism for invading and annexing . 
  and since ukraine is a part of europe , invading ukraine is endangering europe . 
  the definition of europe does n't suddenly change along with putin 's imaginary borders . 
  not a conspiracy , it 's a common negotiation tactic . 
  network specialist here . 
  the thing with stupid people -- and there are a lot to deal with if you 're in it -- is they 'll jump on the bandwagon . 
  the stupid people , while not having the slightest clue how the internet actually works , will have taken notice of the demonstrations and will be taught , in a pavlovian way , to associate `` internet tax '' with `` bad '' . 
  so , the effect of the demonstrations will also be the bandwagon effect influencing the stupid . 
  and in this case , that 's what you want , because relevant understanding of the subject matter is a bridge too far . 
  powerful response . 
  you mean like the german bnd who divulged the plans of the hamburg cell to the u.s. before 9/11 and were ignored by a myopic white house , then blamed after 9/11 for not informing the u.s. of a pending attack ? 
  then subjected to mass nsa surveillance ? 
  which intelligence service actually did n't inform or warn the u.s. ? 
  i think it would be easier if we made a list of those who did n't as opposed to those who did . 
  it 'd be shorter . 
  in the end , normal citizens in both the united states and europe are in the same boat now ; we are losing our civil liberties not to terrorists , but , as usual , to fearmongering politicians . 
  we will have to live with the threat of terrorist attacks for a long time to come , but deaths due to terrorist attacks acount for only an extremely small amount each year in the west . 
  if we want to stay free rather than `` protected '' by a totalitarian state we will have to learn to live not only with the threat of terrorist attack but also with the fact that we 're *** not *** going to go apeshit on basic liberties every time people die . 
  if anything , we should be waging a war on car accidents . 
   the government , which is 100 % human , had nothing to do with 9/11 . 
  carry on . 
  except the cia lied to the fbi about the presence of khalid al-mihdhar and nawaf al-hazmi and only informed them about their presence when it was too late . 
  this is criminal negligence . 
  and just the tip of the iceberg , because from a to z , the hijackers were pampered and shepharded through their preperation phase by the saudi secret service and the royal family , and both were closely allied with george tenet and the bush family . 
  this is n't a `` conspiracy theory '' , this is what you read if you actually study 9/11 and read the government reports . 
  and ever so often , you will hear former senator bob graham call for declassification of more information about this . 
  and he will be rebuffed by the corrupt and condemned as a `` conspiracy theorist '' by others . 
   is someone forcing you to read articles and comment on them ? 
  nope . 
  no , they are not . 
  however , i will say whatever i want , where i want and when i want as long as it does n't violate the sub rules . 
  found some polls . 
  http://survation.com/poll-for-sky-news-reveals-breadth-of-opinion-over-europe/ http://www.newsnetscotland.scot/index.php/scottish-opinion/6761-scotland-and-the-eu-the-polling-evidence apparently it 's difficult , according to the first link . 
  well i do n't know how wales and scotland feel . 
  how do they feel about it ? 
  dear diary , today , op was a faggot . 
  can england get this over with already ? 
  i 'm so tired of listening to exit threats . 
  let 's do this so we can finally stop talking about it , and you can have farage back for domestic consumption . 
  yeah , you can just let the middle east come to you , and pay out handsome welfare checks for swedish jihadis to finance domestic attacks with . 
  great news , if accurate . 
  heh , wry but hilarious . 
  headline may have been updated , because that 's not the headline . 
  headline currently : ### france denies russia warship delivery reports, 
  hence the poem !, 
  nothing negative , recently spoke to a bulgarian at a job fair in amsterdam , he spoke flemish-flavored dutch , i thought that was really amusing . 
  beautiful women , i spoke to a girl who said the language was similar to serbian so i said i knew a few words , but only bad words ; she insisted on hearing it so i said something dirty in serbian/yugoslav and she laughed really hard !, 
  * i met a traveller from an antique land * * who said : `` two vast and trunkless legs of stone * * stand in the frozen lake . 
  near them , on the ice , * * half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown , * * and wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command , * * tell that its sculptor well those passions read * * which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things , * * the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed : * * and on the pedestal these words appear : * * ` my name is johann olav koss , king of kings : * * look on my works , ye mighty , and despair !, 
  ' * * nothing beside remains . 
  round the decay * * of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare * * the lone and level ice stretch far away .
