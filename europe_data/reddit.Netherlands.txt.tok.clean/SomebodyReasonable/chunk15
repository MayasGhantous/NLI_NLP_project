  your comment history is an orgy of active measures . 
  you 're * that guy * . . and you want payback . 
  i like it when people try to summon mob justice . 
   no , he just said that they loved tourists in general . 
  i 'm sure he does . 
   seriously , people who use ad hominem in arguments annoy me . 
  i care very much . 
   yes , and how does that relate to his comment ? 
  his comment confirms how much sweden loves tourists , especially russian tourists . 
  this after another incursion by sea after an incursion into swedish airspace earlier . 
  ( incursions into airspace are very serious , usually , the threat remains limited to adiz )  seriously , your edgy `` ebil russianz '' comment was uncalled for . 
  seriously , people on reddit who use the `` term '' edgy to gain the upper hand without making an effort are making me cringe . 
  the russians that may come wo n't be well-paying tourists . 
  the sketch is propaganda . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/active_measures that 's my point . 
  surely you made up your mind before asking , otherwise you would n't have downvoted it . 
  cheers . 
  this is n't a `` sketch '' though , it 's a satirical cartoon . 
  that said , this reminds me of that [ german sketch ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsofq7tgtlg ) by `` die anstalt '' mocking mh 17 . 
  a painful , ten minute long , almost humorless assault , basically comparing the german press to nazis in `` der untergang '' led by a calm but decisive joseph goebbels-like character , filled to the brim with all the usual debunked russian propaganda . 
  brilliant . . not . 
  i think russia has assets attempting to influence public opinion with `` humor '' . 
  downvote brigade , your target is here ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^, 
  and what happened to the two russian fsb officers caught by estonia shortly afterward ? 
  how much will they spend with a collapsed economy and a devalued ruble ? 
  will they pause between executing citizens to buy tourist paraphernalia ? 
  will nuclear radiation spoil the otherwise jolly welcoming atmosphere ? 
  edit : feel the hate . . heh heh . 
  yeah , you do n't want to be next ... 
  we have supermarkets open on sundays these days . 
  we usually settle that with `` uiterwaarden '' , called `` flood plains '' or `` washlands '' in english .

  thanks, 
  do n't compare ukraine to russia . 
  there is no realistic comparison . 
  whatever false stories were spread in ukrainian media pale in comparison to the orgy of deceit that is russian media . 
  so , this rumor most likely is n't true , but ukrainian media does n't deserve the comparison . 
  yep , `` twee vingers schuim '' -- `` two fingers foam '' -- eww that sounds dirty in english ... 
  but everybody i know in nl , when they start talking about german beer , their eyes get all dreamy ... they just tune out for a moment . 
  :p the taste , but above all , the size of the glasses ... 
  it is a thing of beauty . 
  this is it : the pinnacle of beerdom : http://weihenstephaner.de/ excuse me while i wipe a tear from my eye . . just had some spicey food , you know ?

  hmmm ...  the foundations for franco-russian cooperation on a program of this size have been laid on several fronts over the last few years . 
  france 's thales already provides components for russia 's front line military equipment , from tank gunnery sights to avionics and targeting pods for russian-built fighters . 
  recent memoranda of understanding for cooperation in naval r&d external link ( thales ) and defense r&d more generally external link ( eads ) build on the 2006 mou between dcn and the russian government external link to develop technical , industrial and commercial co-operations between the mistral 's builder and russia 's naval defense industry . 
  ( ... )  `` a russian combat management system will be installed on board in france . 
  ** the communication system will integrate russian communication equipment with french equipment . 
  ** some of these equipment will be installed and integrated with the french equipment , some russian equipment will be installed in russia . 
  the radar is french . 
  esm ( electronic support measures , detects & pinpoints incoming radar emissions ) is not planned on board . 
  only the pre-installation of the self-defence ( a360 , gibkha ) will be done in france . 
  the installation will be done in russia , after the delivery of the ship . '' http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/russia-to-order-french-mistral-lhds-05749/ they ca n't get rid of the possible entry points for self-destructive malware , backdoors and rootkits , it seems . . 
  what can a foreigner do for ukraine practically ? 
  what can we do to help ? 
  serious q. 
  okay , so keep crimea , because putin is never going to yield that territory anyway , but then get out of donbas . 
  now . 
  deal ? 
  no , of course not , because nothing is ever enough . 
  the biggest problem is the exodus of non-russians from annexed and disputed territories , self-legitimizing the `` they want to join russia '' claims . 
  this way , putin can *** manufacture *** ethnic homogeneity and political unison through covert guerilla conflict under the guise of humanitarian intervention . 
  wow . . we 're really pulling this train together with the germans and the scandinavians . 
  it 's a russian source anyway . 
  why trust what it says , when its aim is to divide us and conquer ? 
  if they do sell it , and as an it guy i ca n't believe i 'm saying this ... -- they need to backdoor that shit up the wazoo , like they did with the exocet missiles ... 
  is n't 2017 a bit slow ... ? 
  shit could hit the fan any moment ... 
  i really worry about poland , although i know they 'll fight like lions . 
  otherwise we should send in nato forces , and nl should send troops too , like that recently formed qrf . . 
  if you 'll let us help , that is . 
   adding in antisemitism is not a strawman , for the purpose of this debate they should go hand in hand together . 
  if anything that should bolster your point . 
  you said :  islam and judaism have nothing to do with it . 
  correct ? 
  do i need to remind you of this again ? 
  this claim has nothing to do with whether or not anti-circumcision is fueled by anti-semitism , it categorically denies any link to islam and judaism altogether . 
  then adding anti-semitism ( and * admitting you added it * , too ) means i need to support that , and i have n't yet , because that 's not what i was responding to . 
  you are confused . 
   i do not see any racist profanity , here . 
  i quote :  in other words , this is not something people support because fuck muslims , or fuck jews . 
  you have a selective memory , do n't you ? 
   i fail to bother citing sources for `` i do n't find your claim convincing '' , this is due to not needing one . 
  you need to cite sources claiming health is the only concern rather than political overtones to prove it . 
  claiming you do n't need proof by attempting to claim the proof requirement is for something else entirely is sophism ; i figured that 's what you were doing all along anyway . 
   the op-ed author 's expertise in the area is counter-balanced by her biases . 
  no , it 's not . 
   it remains an opinion and as such is weak evidence of anything . 
  an * expert * opinion . 
  you , on the other hand , have absolutely *** nothing *** . 
   there are some forms of female circumcision that are comparable to male circumcision , or which are of lesser medical impact than male circumcision , which remain illegal . 
  if it 's of lesser medical impact , than the circumcision is fine with me . 
  but that was never your point , and you never qualified it . 
  you wanted to play the slippery slope card towards full female genital mutilation . 
   the pro-circumcision side prefers not to because it is a comparison they find unsettling and one that undermines their position . 
  apparently not , and i 'm not pro-circumcision per se , just anti-bullshit . 
   the pro-circumcision side prefers not to because it is a comparison they find unsettling and one that undermines their position . 
  try actually undermining * something * with sources , evidence , logic and argument , while remaining abreast with your own comment history , how 's that ? 
  sophist contrarianism is not an argument ; it 's a mockery , so stop rejecting expert opinion with weak excuses and start citing your own reliable sources . 
  this is n't going anywhere .
