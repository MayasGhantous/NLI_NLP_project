  thanks southern buddy !, 
  whoops . 
  only a candidate/prospect at this point . 
  praised them anyway , no regrets . 
  op , could you clarify ? 
  do you expect strictly eu members and no european countries ? 
   the initial claim i was responding to was then you should have picked your words more carefully , lest you load the suspicion of moving the goalposts on yourself . 
   i threw anti-semitism in there along with it . 
  which is called a `` straw man argument '' . 
   i disagree with the idea that this is mostly about circumcision being a proxy for anti-islamic or anti-semitic prejudice . 
  in that light , my clarification was meaningful and not a side-step . 
  straw man arguments , denial , racist profanity and a distinct lack of will to actually cite sources to validate * your * opinion do n't really qualify as meaningful . 
   your op-eds do nothing to substantiate the claim , they merely repeat it in slightly different terms . 
  you are in denial :  ** jocelyne cesari is senior research fellow at the berkley center for religion , peace and world affairs at georgetown university , and director of the islam in the west program at harvard university . 
  ** her expertise qualifies as evidence , because citing her is argument from actual authority , rather than misleading authority . 
  you overlooked that and continued to assert your unqualified * opinion * without evidence . 
   the argument that the health concerns are minimal is an argument that would suggest that we also legalise some forms of female circumcision i already covered this itt . 
  there is no comparison , and i explained that explicitly multiple times . 
  sexual pleasure is a health issue as well , by the way . 
   there are very few arguments in favour of permitting male circumcision that do not also work for some forms of female circumcision . 
  utter nonsense . 
  i do n't expect you to bring forth anything substantial , you show no desire to . 
  you can have the last word . 
  yeah , you tell him ... because imo , the flemish are way better at dutch than we are , and the gddnt demonstrates this yearly . 
  your literary works are better too , your education system , your music , and so on . 
  the whole `` belgians are dumb '' - meme makes me cringe knowing how far removed from the truth it really is . 
  yes , but i 'm actually answering what you said then , not what you 're suddenly saying now . 
  so fact is , islam and judaism have * everything * to do with this subject . 
  however , if i move to your next argument , that wo n't necessarily hold either : http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/anti-semitism-and-germanys-movement-against-circumcision/266794/ and :  beyond fighting to protect jewish rituals , there is a second dimension , which raises questions of a different nature . 
  were all pace supporters of the anti-circumcision motion motivated solely by child welfare ? 
  was what transpired merely a collision between two universal democratic values -- the other being freedom of religion ? 
  one should not be na\u00efve : there is a major , ongoing battle against religion as europe moves toward secularization . 
   there is also a strong desire in some political circles to make life uncomfortable for muslims . 
   problems for jews affected by these anti-muslim actions are often considered collateral damage . 
  yet this means that anti-semitism plays a role in the attacks on circumcision . 
  http://www.jpost.com/opinion/op-ed-contributors/whats-hiding-behind-attacks-on-circumcision-329454  the second factor in the radicalization of muslim youth is the increase of discriminatory policies vis-\u00e0-vis islamic practices in europe , including the use of the hijab and regulation of mosque minarets , circumcision and halal food . 
  all contribute to a growing sense among muslims that they are not accepted as full members of european society . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/08/28/how-to-stop-radicalization-in-the-west/europe-needs-to-embrace-islam the anti-islamist trend in europe has something to do with this as well . 
  and i 'm not even pro-islamist . 
  if you follow the news , and understand shifting political sentiments , this is n't some great mystery , just denial on your part . 
  in the end , of course , the health concerns with male circumcision are minimal to non-existent . 
  people in northern europe simply feel that baby 's penises just should n't be altered with a knife , with resentment mostly stemming from anti-islamism with jewish culture caught up in the situation as collateral damage . 
  before i answer that , you specifically said , and i quote :  islam and judaism have nothing to do with it . 
  correct ? 
  you did say this , right ? 
  and i never said it was a reason for attacking jews in the first place , remember ? 
  try not to use a straw man argument . 
   i do n't know what haaretz is . 
  have look at the article you 're commenting on . 
  i wonder how many operational su-27 ukraine had , which were not stationed in the donbas region and under russian control , at the time when mh17 was shot down . 
  the russians may have tried to factor that in . 
  wild guess , probably wrong . 
   so why do n't iremove my child 's teeth and give them dentures so they never have to deal with painful tooth procedures ? 
  because it 's not an established religious ritual , it 's much , much more invasive , has a myriad of adverse consequences and is completely nonsensical . 
  ear lobes : same story . 
  slippery slope fallacy , too . 
  female genital mutilation , on the other hand , is clearly very harmful . 
  what is it with the all-out hysteria itt ? 
  i hear even luxembourg exists !, 
  yet , there 's word on the streets ... but i understand what you mean . 
  why are n't we engaging them then ? 
  i should have known that , sorry . 
  people from bosnia are good , friendly and intelligent people . 
  heh ... how come you guys both have different flags ? 
  your tag both says serbia , although one says serbia and the other says republika srbska . 
   you guys exist . 
  you too !, 
  forgot to mention it , but that was germany . 
   northern europe , which has no tradition of routine circumcision , has been struggling with the challenges of its jewish and muslim minorities . 
  finland is considering legislation to legalise male circumcision . ^ [ 99 ] sweden in 2001 passed a law requiring traditional circumcisers to be certified and for the infants to be given a medically administered anaesthetic . 
  the world jewish congress said that '' [ t ] his is the first legal restriction placed on a jewish rite in europe since the nazi era . 
  '' ^ [ 100 ]  on june 26 , 2012 , a court in cologne , germany ruled that circumcision was `` inflicting bodily harm on boys too young to consent '' , deciding that the practice contravenes the `` interests of the child to decide later in life on his religious beliefs '' . ^ [ 101 ] the decision based on the article `` criminal relevance of circumcising boys . 
  a contribution to the limitation of consent in cases of care for the person of the child '' ^ [ 102 ] published by holm putzke , a german law professor at the university of passau . ^ [ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ] the decision of the court in the city of cologne , that a child 's right to physical integrity trumps religious and parental rights , applied only within the jurisdiction of that court . 
  the ruling was condemned by jewish and muslim groups in europe . ^ [ 106 ] a broad majority of german lawmakers passed a resolution asking angela merkel 's government to clarify the ruling so as to allow jews and muslims to continue to practice their religion . 
  on 12 december 2012 , following a series of hearings and consultations , the bundestag adopted a law explicitly permitting non-therapeutic circumcision to be performed under certain conditions by a vote of 434-100 , with 46 abstentions . ^ [ 107 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circumcision_controversies#other_contemporary_controversies so , maybe in scandinavia , but the rest . . remains to be seen , juvenile `` fuck jews , fuck muslims '' responses notwithstanding . 
  published in haaretz . . 
  pure coincidence of course . 
  yes , absolutely . 
  this makes me want throw an rt journalist off a plane at cruising altitude . 
  yes , so what ? 
  do you have a point ? 
  millions and millions of boys have been circumsized for religious reasons . 
  if it is done correctly , cleanly and professionally , as is customary in modern , civilized societies , it 's not the monstrous ritual you so desperately want it to be . 
  elsewhere , and under different circumstances , it may well be , and sometimes is . 
  i acknowledge both sides . 
  you , on the other hand , are frothing at the mouth over even the procedures performed in a professional manner . 
  your tantrum is laughable . 
   how great must the benefits be to override the need for the person 's consent for a permanent operation like that ? 
  a baby can never give consent . 
  therefore , its parents decide . 
  then , society decides if the parents may decide that . 
  then , it comes a question of religious freedom ( jews , muslims , etc. ), 
  versus child abuse . 
   islam and judaism have nothing to do with it . 
  nonsense .

  i ca n't be arsed . 
  100 journalists ... wow . 
  that 's ... depressing . 
  i also wondered what happened to arafat .
