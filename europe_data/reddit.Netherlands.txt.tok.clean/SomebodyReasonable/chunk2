  if i read british media , i see they 're trying to spin it as if gchq was interested in `` terrorists '' . 
  after it was revealed merkel 's cellphone was tapped , are you really surprised ? 
  this captures the british mentality perfectly . 
  the eu are a bunch of dirty socialists who must be kept an eye on . 
   david cameron has said the british people are his only `` boss '' on the eu as he hit back at criticism from the outgoing president of the european commission , jos\u00e9 manuel barroso , who accused him of making an `` historic mistake '' on europe http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/eu-leaders-conservative-plan-free-movement-cap-migrants-barroso  `` why should britain be punished with the shock eu bill for fragile success while france is rewarded with a rebate for abject failure ? '', 
  the best-selling sun tabloid asked on monday . 
   `` why should we make taxpayers borrow 1.7 billion pounds only to hand it over to feckless bunglers ? 
  eurocrats like jose barroso ( the outgoing commission president ) can strut and bluster about our legal obligations but we have the whip hand . '', 
  http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/27/uk-britain-politics-eu-idukkbn0ig1p420141027 and so on , and so forth . 
   fact is we have an aircraft carrier where is it ? 
  can it carry aircraft ? 
   it 's ok . 
  i was just hoping the bar was a little higher than michael gove = the uk . 
  straw man argument . 
  perhaps you 'd like to set it alight ? 
   you cant just ignore corruption because some brits are loud whiny and xenophobic . 
  most of us are pretty nice guys , its the ones who arent that youll hear about though . 
  oh , i agree , it 's just that it 's time the anti-eu bawling got some pushback . 
   also your username doesnt fit your comments , you seem like a pretty unreasonable guy if you ask me . 
  i disagree . 
  it 's pretty obvious the uk is on an anti-eu crusade , to the point where they have their intelligence services perform cyberattacks against brussels . 
  an extremely ugly and criminal move . 
  no , you 're right , i ca n't source every single briton to make this point , just the chief whip of the tories . 
  you win !, 
   your assertion was that `` you guys do n't even have an aircraft carrier '' which is untrue hell no !, 
  ** you do n't have an aircraft carrier ** . 
  did you read what i just posted ? 
  ** you will have one ready for operations no sooner than 2020 ** . 
  as the guardian stated ( in 2010 ) :  *** the uk will be without an aircraft carrier capable of carrying jets for around a decade . 
  *** to avoid misunderstandings : i am ** not ** happy about this . 
   michael gove has taken a vicious sideswipe at outgoing eu chief jose manuel barroso over the demand for britain to pay more money to brussels . 
   he compared the # 1.7 billion bill , which downing street blames on mr barroso , to the way bill clinton 's staff sabotaged computers when they left the white house in 2001 . 
   the chief whip fiercely criticised the eu commission president , who steps down in the next few weeks , for failing to mention the issue when he visited downing street last week . 
   ` the timing just as the commission are leaving is most surprising , ' mr gove told the mail on sunday . 
   ` it 's almost as though this commission decided , as was the case when clinton 's team left the white house , to deliberately sabotage computer keyboards for the incoming bush team .

  i know that very well , but they 'll only be operational in 2020 , no ? 
   she was named by queen elizabeth ii on 4 july 2014 and is scheduled to commission in early 2017 , ** with initial operational capability from 2020 ** . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_queen_elizabeth_%28r08%29  david cameron today pledged that britain would remain a `` front-rank '' military power as he sought to reassure service personnel over cuts to the defence budget that mean the uk will be without an aircraft carrier capable of carrying jets for around a decade . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/19/david-cameron-defence-cuts-decade-aircraft-carriers-no-jets so that 's five years you 'll be sitting with your thumbs up your asses . 
  at best . 
   different people have different preferences here . 
  there is no single view . 
  i think the city of london determines the agenda . 
  i think it 's a dog and pony show . 
  it 's all a small little club , if you come to think of it . 
  like the bullingdon club , for example . 
  http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/03/14/the-bullingdon-club/  the fact that there is n't even an obvious candidate and people in the eu ca n't decide whether they think it should be paris or frankfurt makes me think that london does not have much competition from them . 
  this is n't a `` race '' or a `` candidacy '' , it 's a process that will evolve organically . 
  the only reason you want to frame this as such is so that you can go on to ridicule a straw man . 
  i like your rhetorical style . 
  *  both paris and germany appear to be keen on heavy regulation , which finance does not like . 
  and we 're full circle , are n't we . 
  let me fix that for you , btw : both paris and germany appear to be keen on heavy regulation , which ~ ~ finance ~ ~ criminals do n't like . 
   its so strange to me that people talk of `` cultural integrity '' but their own countries culture is almost completely different to how it was 200 years ago . 
  actually , this is n't true . 
  this is just an assertion on your part . 
  many core values and traditions still remain . 
   cultures change , same as everything ; deal with it . 
  yes , we will deal with it , i promise you that . 
  yes , i realize that fully . 
  i have family there . 
  it 's not o'reilly who kicked this off , it 's `` ceo '' . 
  they show no signs of being the sort of organization who would shill for uk interests , so i 'll assume i 'm wrong on that one . 
  but not because i do n't understand the difference between ireland and the uk . 
   the concept of preserving national culture is in clear conflict with the ideas of equality , tolerance and acceptance of differences , not if what you bring in is itself in clear conflict with the ideas of equality , tolerance and acceptance of differences . 
  see the irony ? 
   in many ways , liberalism is based on challenging and breaking the established traditions in the society , not preserving them . 
  even if that change is heavily reactionary ? 
   a country that is so afraid for its national culture that it 's willing to close its borders over that is a deeply conservative-minded country . 
  for many people , that in itself is a terrible thing , and something to fight against politically and ideologically . 
  i think it 's entirely normal . 
  just like nepal and the baltic states . 
  taken jordan 's syrian refugee problem . 
  what do you propose ? 
  unlimited access ? 
  sovereignty means , among other things , freedom from invasion , either militarily or demographically . 
  hence the reaons why countries have immigration controls in the first place . 
  i 've settled on the theory that the city does not want financial regulation from `` communist '' brussels . 
  farage is a city man , he 's representing their interests . 
  but they 're betting on gaining more power over fiscal policy rather than an exit . 
  that 's why they have n't exited yet . 
  i presume the referendum will show the british population wants out - then they 'll be up shit 's creek because they 'll actually have to follow through . 
  ha ha . 
   the eu is not even close to having a financial centre that rivals the city . 
  and that will change quickly after the exit . 
  frankfurt or paris are the most likely candidates . 
  it 'll take time , but the outcome is inevitable . 
  i prefer a brexit , but i fear farage and cameron are bluffing . 
  and the anti-eu smear campaign just initiated smacks of more desperation . 
   *** bamieh , a british prosecutor *** uk can into airings its dirty eu laundry . 
  the prequel : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2len1q/eu_commissioner_barroso_received_money_from/ not happy with germany 's bargaining style , i guess . 
  i mean , yes , yes , we get it , just get out of the eu already , jeez . 
  anyways , given this article : [ reuters - eu exit could wreck uk financial capital , says city lobby group ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/27/uk-britain-europe-idukbrea3q00a20140427 ) and op 's article , do n't think this is going well for the uk , not now , not after an exit . 
  the uk has a severe attitude problem , one the eu has tolerated for five to ten years , but is now fed up with . 
  this truly is , as the reuters article above describes , not evenly matched . 
  the uk needs the eu more than the eu needs the uk . 
  in any case , i too believe an exit is the best option . 
  the uk will be much poorer , but i believe much happier , and the eu will have peace of mind , finally . 
   militarily and diplomatically the uk is on a different scale from italy and spain . 
  but france and germany are right behind you .
