  there will be more russians who * understand * english so they can read the news without the translation services ( which are very popular and do translate news critical of putin without trying to alter the translation ) so , basically , they have no excuse if they have an internet connection . 
  birthing a mentally handicapped `` donetsk people 's republic '' . 
  you mean like the internet ? 
  we have to put up with russian idiots on reddit claiming ukraine shot down mh 17 regularly . 
  they appear to be proficient enough to spread propaganda over the net , and we tell them they 're wrong , with links to * every other normal media outlet * . 
  to no avail . 
  i have no pity . 
  ( except for the minority of dissenters ), 
  in most dutch restaurants , you 're expected to spend an extra $ 100 euro . 
  the best way to give it is to grab a random waitress by the buttocks and shove the money in her skirt . 
  try to accompany it with a dutch greeting , i.e. 
   and neither should they . 
  we 're a democracy - for better or worse - not an expertocracy . 
  most of us live in a plutocracy disguised as a democracy , meaning the people with the money spend lots of money to convince the rest of the people of things they must do , not do or things they must believe . 
  kosovo perhaps , and the greek and the macedonians tend argue over whether macedonia is greek or not . 
  at least that 's what a half-greek girlfriend once told me . 
  other than that , i do n't really know . 
  * phew * ... wipes forehead . 
  but buyers are interested in hardware and software integrity , see the conundrum ? 
  you do realise that both moscow and berlin have reverted to *** typewriters *** for certain work since the snowden revelations ? 
  as for doubting , you implied you wanted a source for the drone feed hack , you got it . 
  the other story , i hope you 'll spare me the trouble of sourcing that for you . . 
  what on earth are you babbling about ? 
  are you a tea party rightist looking to unload some talk radio drivel ? 
  http://www.wired.com/2012/10/hack-proof-drone/ this is my field ... 
  i do n't quite understand what you 're doubting me for . 
  if you understand what i meant by security through obscurity ; i 'm advocating proper security practices *** as a precursor to the introduction of free software and hardware *** ... which would absolutely be a course change for any military . 
  it represents an extraordinary , perhaps *** insurmountable *** challenge because maintaining an edge over the enemy requires , to a certain extent , security through obscurity . 
  ( although video feeds and drones can be protected with a proper pki-infrastructure . ), 
  the whole thing starts over but in the albanian restaurant , with the brown-skinned actor now playing the owner and the other guy the waiter , but this time the couple quicky flees to mcdonalds instead . 
  in other words . . yawn . . 
  well , consider how iran hijacked an american drone , and how jihadis tapped into us video drone feeds ... 
  general term . . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/security_through_obscurity the tension between open standards and military secrecy may obstruct free software and open hardware making inroads . 
  bad comedy , and a commercial for mcdonalds at the end , but the comment section is hilarious . . macedonians and albanians *** and greek *** going at each other like wild animals , lol !, 
  unfortunately the reaction in europe seems to have been : let 's start * really * spying on the americans then . 
  while i 'm not sure if this supposed sentiment , spread by the press , is even genuine , it 's the wrong move . 
  i wonder how viable foss in the defense industry would be , because i think `` security by obscurity '' is still much too much of a thing there . 
  and i 'm definitely not saying we should n't buy american planes . 
  i 'm just saying the fear of backdoors is n't unreasonable due to a history of shameless cyberattacks on the eu by the uk and the usa . 
  ( op socialist comes to mind ) the persistent lack of understanding why european leadership sees this as a problem will boost european tech and defense industry to the detriment of u.s. businesses . 
  already hundreds of billions of dollars are projected lost . 
  this is n't limited to verizon . 
  so , while nobody can predict exactly what effects this will have on defense trade , one can hardly label european concerns about backdoors as `` unreasonable '' . 
  not in the slightest . 
  like i said , any sort of backdoor is unacceptable , whether built by a friend or by an enemy . 
  of course , americans can deride these concerns , but i must say i find that attitude astonishing and self-defeating , as is evident from growing economic losses in the cloud sector and elsewhere . 
  then again , i know that my fellow u.s. 
  it experts agree with me , they just ca n't get washington to listen . 
  ah , yes , thanks , 
  because there is no evidence for it whatsoever . 
  in theory , it 's certainly possible , but then again , it 's also theoretically possible that obama is spying for kenya . 
  if the american response to being caught red-handed continues to be anger , indignation and victim blaming , then business in europe will prove much more difficult . 
  likewise , if european tech companies were caught building backdoors into equipment they were selling to the u.s. they would get into a serious argument and they would be crucified ; rightfully so in my opinion . 
  this is what it workers think and feel . 
  secret or mandatory backdoors are unacceptable . 
  because ... nokia was n't backdoored by finnish intelligence . 
  but there have been repeated conflicts with china . 
  in germany , verizon lost a huge contract and the end is not in sight . 
  did n't they debut the plane in the latest is bombing campaign over syria ? 
  could you answer my last question ? 
  i work in it . 
  in no universe whatsoever is building secret backdoors into equipment acceptable . 
  this is not optional or negotiable . 
  the link to the exocet story is to illustrate that arms-crippling backdoors do exist . 
  you must know what is happening to the cloud computing industry in the united states right now . 
  if you want to sell your products , you need trust , otherwise alternatives become more attractive . 
  now , the americans surely would n't accept a finnish backdoor in finnish telco hardware , would they ? 
  we have precedent with many states bordering russia and similar economic ties . 
  i 'm reminded of the dutch illusion of neutrality before the second world war . 
  true , but i still want to read that as of yet unwritten article . . 
  i 'm going to study this guy a bit ... good points though . . 
  you have to admit that the suspicion of backdoors engendered in allies was brought upon the us all by themselves . 
  the u.s. would obviously not use such backdoors , but just having them in the first place is unacceptble in the extreme , even more so in military equipment . 
  remember thatcher , mitterand and exocet missiles ? 
  i just really want to know the details if how this guy got the post . 
  i 'd pay for a newspaper writing that story with the necessary depth . . 
  i also wonder ... is there anything else even nearly as bad ? 
  like a fisheries commissioner who says he fishes every day or `` had to google fish '' ... 
  i mean ... wow ... only in it huh ? 
  well , i must admit i expect * some * stupidity and incompetence , but shit like this means they actually truly went * out of their way * to appoint someone who is very old and very incompetent or otherwise perhaps even a drunk or some bobo 's golfing buddy . 
  this incident , along with the recent dutch incident cited above , truly defies imagination . 
  i 'm actually very upset this is happening . 
  do you just remember this or is there a technical way to tell ? 
  thanks for alerting the rest of us though , seriously . 
  i do n't understand why putin can invade european countries but finland is too afraid to join nato . 
  the point is you have to do it *** now *** before putin makes his move , not after . 
  shame finland is so economically dependent on russia . 
  stay strong finnish friends, 
  loved that show . . what i 've seen of it on youtube that is . 
  especially the episode with the bomb disposal robot . 
  still sucks balls though . . 
  yes , i know , and i knew about several of the issues discussed in the video , but it 's the poignancy with which the argument for vigilance is delivered by vike-freiberga . 
  it reminds me of the netherlands in 1939 , very strongly . 
  we had neglected our defenses too , thinking we could stay neutral again . 
  but i will keep in mind what you said . 
  you know , recently , after yet another publication in dutch msm about it boondoggle scandals , billions wasted , the ** chairman ** of the commission investigating the matter said he had to google what `` it '' means . 
  that and every manager of every it department i 've ever worked in was an idiot . 
  managers fear and hate it when it gets technical and this facilitates the appointment of it managers who nothing about it ; at least he 's one of `` them '' . 
  it 's sad and infuriating but competence does n't rule the world and it never will . 
  just the competence to be dominant .
