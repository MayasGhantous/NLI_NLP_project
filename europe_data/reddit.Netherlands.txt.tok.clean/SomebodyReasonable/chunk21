  ** edit : ** the chairwoman of the lower house said this , not the chairman of the investigative committee . 
  oh wow , lol ... that 's ... funny but a tad disturbing ... heh . 
  lose europe , gain russia . 
  good idea ? 
  sowing discord among european allies is going to be the fsb 's main tactic for a significant time to come . 
  do n't worry , i have a feeling italy is slowy doing better . 
  at least , i hope so . 
  these guys are just an irrelevant minoity right ? 
  fascinating , thank you . 
  why ? 
  he 's completely isolated now . 
  everybody knows germany and merkel matter most ... 
  not ns . 
  in the end , it 's what these men do as individuals that i admire . 
  why ? 
  leaver dea as slaef !, 
  a bonus might be an improvement of their image , yes . 
  good for them . 
  meanwhile , they are trained soldiers helping the kurds in their most desperate hour , to fight an enemy who shows its captured opponents no mercy . 
  they risk not just death but public decapitation . 
  so you go and badmouth these men however you want , but you will never hold a candle to them and their courage . 
   we 're going to wait erdogan out . 
  like putin but with less fighting them . 
  * shruggs * well , what do you know ? 
  ;-)  ** erdo\u011fan likes to polarize and behaves increasingly like the authoritarian russian president vladimir putin . 
  he is currently in his third and final term as prime minister . 
  in 2014 he hopes to be elected as president , with more powers than that of the current president abdullah g\u00fcl . 
  many liberal analysts fear that in that scenario a further deterioration of the turkish political climate : from a weak democracy with an intimidated press , a weak parliament and a politically driven judiciary , to a system with russian characteristics . 
  ** http://www.turkeycorrespondent.com/2012/10/04/erdogan-increasingly-behaves-like-putin/comment-page-1/ like putin indeed . 
  it 'll probably take more than just patience . 
   in the past the military would get involved , i wonder if it will come to that ? 
  erdogan anticipated this and has effectively disabled this from ever happening again . 
  he just executed a stalinesque purge of the top military brass , and that was the end of secular turkey . 
  read this , it 's fascinating . 
  it ought to be a movie . 
  framing the army , false flag operation plans , deep state , involvement in the highest echelons . . compelling material . 
  you are completely off base . 
  these guys are veterans , they do n't even drink on club nights , and if i had to hazard a guess , they 're former special forces . 
  this is one of them : http://drrichswier.com/wp-content/uploads/ron-no-surrender-fighting-with-kurds.jpg i 'm all for it . 
  if ron wants to fight these pieces of shit trying to massacre kobani , that 's his prerogative . 
  he is well trained and knows what he 's doing . 
  here he is on footage in the news : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wjxvoc_x-q, 
  sigh ... okay ... 
   all this does makes turkey ineligible for eu accession . 
  your flair says you want portugal out of the eu ... 
  i do n't get your concern for eu membership criteria . 
  the three guys who went are iraq war veterans . 
  but thanks for the brave assessment , amsterdam hitman . 
  this was london in 2005 , near buckingham palace . 
  i did find a place but i maintain it was n't easy . 
  maybe i should go again and not rely on one specific trip . 
  did n't have a smartphone to help me out then either , obviously . 
  i wanted a traditional english breakfast in london , but it was difficult to find one between the mcdonalds , burger king and subway restaurants ... what 's wrong with traditional english food ? 
  i 'm in england dammit , i want to taste the native kitchen !, 
  well , your t-shirt was n't between your teeth , was it ? 
  must be between the teeth , or no pointing out !, 
  half of these self-indulgent stereotyping articles are too broad * brushed * in the first place . 
  but i still like reading them for fun ... 
  a russian speaking former ddr inhabitant ( like putin ) , you would think merkel knows better . 
  we need new leadership in germany . 
  but who ? 
  do n't want a white house puppet either . . 
  for reference for whoever wants to know more : http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/zero_hedge#about_the_author ( zero hedge ) about globalresearch.ca :  chossudovsky is the son of a russian jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 , the career united nations diplomat and academic evgeny chossudovsky ( 1914 -- 2006 ) . 
   ( ... )  in 2001 , chossudovsky founded the centre for research on globalisation ( crg ) , located in montreal , canada , becoming its editor and director . 
  it describes itself as being `` committed to curbing the tide of globalisation and disarming the new world order '' . 
  [ 5 ] crg maintains websites in several languages , including the english-language globalresearch.ca . 
   ( ... )  in a january 2012 article , he characterized the free syrian army as `` a de facto paramilitary creation of nato . 
  '' [ 6 ] syrian president bashar al-assad e-mailed his father-in-law , fawaz akhras , to inquire how true chossudovsky 's claims were . 
  [ 7 ] chossudovsky also claimed that deaths of protesters in the maidan square in kiev were `` triggered by neo-nazi elements ''  ( ... )  he is a favoured commentator at russia today . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michel_chossudovsky he has significant readership among the american pacifist anti-imperialist left , and his commentary just so happens to benefit the kremlin greatly ... almost always . 
  and his father was a `` diplomat '' , which reminds me of an `` fso '' with the u.s. dpt . 
  of state , which practically means `` spy '' anyways . 
  tourist season was a bust . 
  there 'll be lots of regret in crimea too . 
  and nukes in belgium , too . 
  nl can deliver nukes themselves if they want , btw . 
  american crew does upkeep . 
  they might as well be , that 's the point . 
  `` willing propaganda amplifiers '' . 
  as for zero hedge and especially chossudovsky , i have my suspicions , yes . 
  at minimum though , they are amplifiers , hence the precise terminology chosen . 
  the only thing about the u.s. 
  i do n't like is how 9/11 destroyed the bill of rights and how this causes the eu to follow suit and destroy its own system of human rights and the ` rechtsstaat ' . 
  however , american leadership still rotates between various factions . 
  russia is bitter , bellicose and led by a ruthless , nuclear holocaust-seeking dictator . 
  i do n't know for certain . 
  but i do know there are many routes into the european mind for the kremlin . 
  globalresearch.ca , zero hedge , rt , and many willing propaganda amplifiers in the independent online media . 
  i read a pro-putin piece on geenstijl recently , and you know how powerful they are , so there 's that . 
  proof for me is hearing the inane conspiracy babble regurgitated in the bar , so it 's reaching dutch minds one way or another . 
  i think the turning point for me was litvinenko , 2006 . 
   who 's quoting propaganda now ? 
  i am . 
  you are not the victim . 
  it 's not like you needed this to realize what you were dealing with , i hope . 
  although i must say many of my fellow countrymen seem to be firmly brainwashed by russia 's many powerful propaganda tentacles . 
  but you 're going down along with us , so best think twice . 
  http://freebeacon.com/national-security/russia-deploying-tactical-nuclear-arms-in-crimea/ you are a fool or a propagandist . 
  either way , you 're certainly correct that further debate is pointless . 
  much appreciation for the fact you spelled ` ad nauseam ' as such and not ` ad nauseum ' as many on reddit do .
