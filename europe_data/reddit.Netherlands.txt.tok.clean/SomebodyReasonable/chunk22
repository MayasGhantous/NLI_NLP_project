  it annoys me to no end . 
  i guess what it comes down is the general proclivity to bring up the u.s. whenever russia is the topic . 
  in short : yes , russia is a much bigger danger to europe than the u.s. . a pakistani might feel differently , of course . 
   why , what country is more violent ? 
  i said `` undermined '' , not completely disproven . 
  it matters greatly in what context violence was applied . 
  by focusing merely on the application of force and trying to avoid context as much as possible , you can paint the united states as the typical `` great unique satan '' . 
  you desperately need this ruse to deflect from russia 's transgressions . 
  again , the u.s. 's wrongs do not make russia right , and until you face this logical fallacy you 've been committing , you keep deluding yourself . 
  perhaps in my next responses i should repeat `` two wrongs do n't make a right '' until you acknowledge this properly . 
  when it came to yugoslavia and libya , it required eu lobbying and prodding to get clinton and obama respectively , to intervene , precisely because there was little direct material benefit to the u.s. you 're only partially right , and whatever hyperbolic whataboutism you pull out of the hat , it will never excuse putin 's neo-soviet violence . 
  i would even go so far as to say moscow is more dangerous now than it has ever been . 
  my fellow europeans from the east remember ** moscow ** as oppressor , not washington . 
  you are a minority among them . 
  { 1,3 } son j * son matches zero or more capital j 's followed by `` son '' . 
   then a chomsky quote follows i 've decided a while ago that chomsky is n't as great as he 's made out to be . 
  lol, 
  i do n't understand how they can do that ... 
  i even heard they were detained and questioned by the `` local kgb station '' ... apart from the fact that it 's called fsb these days ... how can this be true ? 
   the us is literally the most violent country in the last 69 years , empires have disapeared , but the us still maintains it 's miliaristic policy i believe this statement is undermined by my link . 
   the us has been involved in more wars that any other country , which is amasing considering it 's borders where never under any real threat in more than a few of those , the u.s. is merely executing nato policy which nato members agreed on . 
  ( libya , afghanistan , yugoslavia ) still , none of it matters , because two wrongs do not make a right , russia is still dangerous and wrong , and must be fought and countered . 
  but not at all as you described : there are many , many other warring states . 
  which is the point . 
   kinda coincidental that history supports that extremist nonsense . 
  no , it does n't , but what does it matter ? 
  even if it were factually true , two wrongs does n't make a right . 
  edit : some historical context : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_1945%e2%80%9389, 
  i speak german too . 
  absolutely nothing in there says what you claim it says . 
  the `` german bundestag '' in no way , shape or form `` says '' mh17 was n't shot down by a buk , it just says an awacs plane automatically classified the sa system as an sa-3 because it could n't narrow the ** radar signal ** down further . 
  do n't hate me because i have a life . 
   it was all public knowledge but people did n't pay attention . 
  this is a bald-faced lie . 
  there was some previous upheaval about `` warrantless wiretapping '' but the vast majority of the events , locations , programs and their code names revealed by snowden were unknown and classified . 
  which is exactly why the us government got their knickers in a twist . 
  have you even read `` no place to hide '' ? 
  how about the wikipedia page on the leaks ? 
  the guardian won the pullitzer prize for reporting something that everybody already knew ? 
  you are a * horrible * liar . 
  that you would stoop to this level , using this canard , tells me all about you i ever need to know . 
   i do n't think that any of the conspiracy theories posted here were predicted accurately by conspiracy theory nuts surveillance state . 
  and yes , we were derided as conspiracy nuts . 
  and yes we are it experts . 
  and yes , we had to deal with gullible fools like you a lot , who in their massive ignorance felt entitled to label the messengers `` kooks '' and `` nut jobs '' . 
  also , please google the `` martha mitchell effect '' then , readjust your stupid , gullible attitude . 
  ukraine is europe . 
  you invaded europe first . 
  and the kremlin is publicly threatening all of us from finland to romania . 
  wake the hell up . 
   yes , but they never used nuclear weapons against civilians . 
  yeah , they 're just # 1 in world history of massacres by other means , mostly their own citizens . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_stalin#calculating_the_number_of_victims  western countries caused more wars and deaths than russia in the last 100-150 years . 
  false . 
   it is more likely that sovereign nation will be invaded and people killed by the us and nato puppets , so you do n't have to fear russians . 
  baseless argument on many counts . 
  as for nato `` puppets '' : germany and france refused to participate in the second gulf war . 
  so much for the `` puppet '' argument . 
  there is no monolithic `` west '' no matter how badly putinbots want this to be true . 
   but treating russia and especially the russian people like they are animals is crazy and wrong . 
  since  80 % support putin because of his recent actions , treating russia ** and ** 80 % of its citizens like they are animals is sane and right . 
   the side effect is that almost all major conflict since then was either a direct consequence of it or a indirect one trough self determination struggles or the cold war chess game . 
  overly simplistic extremist nonsense designed to blame the u.s.a. for everything . 
  everything . 
  unfortunately that does mean the poll is useless . 
  i want to know what europeans think , not americans . 
  we already know americans want europe to increase defense spending . 
  you have to be fucking kidding me . 
   russia is n't crazy . 
  i disagree . 
  they are utter lunatics . 
  because of some teeny tiny recent developments that have the entirety of europe on edge . 
  yes , nothing to see here , just some volunteer nukes going on vacation . 
  yeah , they 're just # 1 in world history of massacres by other means , mostly their own citizens . 
  perhaps we should , because russia is certainly preparing to remove us from the world : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2i6uqs/russia_adds_243_nuclear_warheads_to_northern/, 
  non-mobile link : http://www.rferl.org/content/can-russia-disconnect-from-the-internet/26617176.html, 
  just because you have an ixp , does n't mean you can simply disconnect . 
  it 'll take a lot of preparatory work . 
  amsterdam has an ixp ( one of the largest in the world ) and so do london , frankfurt , paris , etc. 
  an ixp is specifically designed to be an international hub , although it also connects regional peers , yes . 
  also , say goodbye to updates for all software and firmware , ntp servers , root dns servers and so on . 
  it 's a ridiculous idea . 
  it may be possible to sustain a severely dysfunctional local net , good luck with that . 
  yeah , apparently . 
   define objectives , strategic goals first then discuss increased military spending . 
  defend against russia . 
  obviously . 
  war is simply not the answer , and except for world war ii , almost every military deployment ( see middle east ) worsened the situation . 
  this is factually false . 
  i agree , am bothered by the naive doves itt . 
  the poll is in our favor anyway , so i 'm not sure the pro-people are talking , they just voted `` yes , meet the 2 % norm '' and left . 
  you could ask / r/credibledefense, 
  libertarian then ? 
  and i apologize for the insult . 
  i understand you wish that , but it 's a fringe position only a hippie non-interventionist with an utter lack of understanding of geopolitics would even suggest . 
  if you suggested what you suggested to any congressman save perhaps dennis kucinich or ron paul , you 'd be laughed out of the room . 
  nato is heritage of wwii , a means of ensuring peace in europe , with europe also coming to bat for the united states if necessary . 
  the wellbeing of europe is utterly essential to the united states , and vice versa . 
  the us will never leave nato , the us built nato . 
  but i guess there 's nothing wrong with dreaming .
