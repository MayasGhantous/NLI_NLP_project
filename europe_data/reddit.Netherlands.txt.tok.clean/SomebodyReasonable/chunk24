  do n't pretend you are knowledgeable in the matter . 
   however , all of these articles are concerned about whether private companies are allowed to resell russian gas . 
  no , not really . 
   the fact of the matter still remains that gazprom deals with sovereign nations no , not really . 
   yes , it does make a difference no , not really . 
   a nation is not a citizen or a company that falls under these relevant trade laws . 
  complete nonsense . 
   so gazprom can most likely put into its contract whatever it wants no , it can not . 
   whether a nation uses companies as a front to breach this contract does n't really matter . 
  this `` concern '' of yours is entirely fictitious and of your own making . 
   is it fair from a free trade perspective ? 
  maybe not . 
  who cares ? 
  your concerns and arguments are based in fantasy . 
  i 've rarely seen more audacious humbug attempted , that i must admit . 
   also , gazprom 's destination clause is completely different from the kind of resell clauses that are the target of the eu anti trust laws . 
  this shows you have n't even studied the links . 
   gazprom 's clause says you must use the gas in your own nation . 
  the resell clauses envisioned by the eu trade law are really different in nature . 
  now show me you have a modicum of intelligence and/or intellectual integrity and cite me a body of reliable sources supporting your ridiculous fantasies . 
  i do n't know why it is you think i must quote sources and you can just babble on and on without any * reliable * sources to back up your claims . 
  see wikipedia for a guideline on what reliable and verifiable sources are . 
  also , this confirms my initial suspicions about you were correct . 
  yeah , he 's completely off his rocker . 
  this wo n't end unless we directly engage russian troops . 
  then we will have to see if he wants to risk mutual nuclear annihilation . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/comingout#wiki_past_coming_out_stories_that_didn.27t_go_well / r/atheismcomingout you 're in denial . 
  probably also a relitard . 
  they 're very good at denial . 
  ( sun revolved around the earth , jesus rode dinosaurs , etc. 
  etc. ), 
  spare me the belittling nonsense . 
  the sheer volume of these stories is sickening and precludes any reasonable effort to fake it all . 
  instead , why do n't you get rid of the tin foil hat ? 
  that 's some industrial strength denial right there . 
  peace of mind through pathological denial and willful ignorance is n't true peace of mind . 
  just self-delusion . 
  why do n't you have the balls to be upfront about it ? 
  i respect that more . 
  just admit putin is a strongarming mafia thug , your brief flirt with democracy is a distant memory and no international law or sense of common decency is going to stop you . 
  this quirky dancing around the truth is just sad . 
   this is all true , but i venture to say that the northern irish unionists are far more religious than most in the netherlands ( outside your bible belt maybe ) . 
  yes , certainly . 
  however , i see this resemblance , if you know what i mean : https://ulsterobserver.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/wpid-photo-29-sep-2012-1250.jpg http://www.rnw.nl/data/files/images/lead/181209%20van%20der%20vlies%20anp.jpg the second photo could be described as the representative for the bible belt . 
  he 's retired now , but just look at that face . 
  he could be in that orange march in belfast . 
   while your royals and some members of parliament may regurgitate religious dogma , my perception is that the same is not true for the dutch public at large . 
  true also . 
   also , i see the dutch as not caring for flashy materialism , i dunno , this is more of a debatable thing . 
  older generations , no , younger , yes , but then again , that 's true of almost any country , right ? 
   nor classicism well , we do have a pretty annoying frat boy culture , to go into that is a book-sized exercise , but the classisism is n't as bad as in the uk . 
  but it should n't be underestimated either . 
  https://stuwww.uvt.nl/fabras/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/fabras.jpg there are hundreds of thousands of frat boys and girls like these in nl . 
  they 're destined for at least moderate wealth , the corps paves the way for that through the `` network '' . 
   which royalty , no matter how humble , would seem to violate . 
  well , it probably wo n't surprise you that willem alexander and his brothers ( one of them recently deceased in a skiiing accident ) could best be described as frat boys , and they were in the corps . 
  long story , but they 've had some antics mildly comparable to the uk royals . 
   still , i 'm surprised it has continued . 
  prince claus liked to break protocol , he was consumed by the gilded cage , as they say . 
  he got parkinsons . 
  willem-alexander openly contemplated reform . 
  the royal family did n't always like the fact that life had been decided for them from birth . 
  i can sympathize with that . 
  maybe it would be better for all involved if we got rid of the monarchy . 
  but . . the house of orange was a force of hope during the second world war , this makes getting rid of it completely almost unthinkable . 
  good summary of things that have been pissing me off . 
  do n't forget mh 17 , although technically falling under 2 . 
  and these are only the recent things , like you said . 
  they 're also intimidating khazakhstan , btw and threatening with nukes , through the usual `` would n't it be unfortunate it something happened to you '' mafia-style plausible deniability rhetoric . 
  i do see it . 
  all the time . 
  example from dutch right-wing extremist website geen stijl ( no style ) : http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2014/09/het_duitse_publiek_klapt_zelfs_kritischer_dan_het_nederlandse.html they 're circlejerking with those german russophile putin-loving comedians ' video clip . 
  you 'll have to throw it through a translator to read it . 
  this the right-wing underbelly of the netherlands , gs is very influential . 
  then again , right-wing newspaper rag the telegraaf was probably very anti-putin during mh17 coverage . 
  i 'm going to write a sternly-worded letter . 
  interested to hear the opinion of other europeans on this . 
  i 'm pro-catalonia but i 'm anti-secession unless lawful and in agreement with the country seceded from . 
  key here is that catalonia itself could suffer the same fate as spain if later on a small region in catalonia decided it wanted to secede from catalonia , similar to scotland and the shetlands . 
  it 's crucial to understand that seceding regions themselves would n't want a chunk of * their own * terroritory seceding if they had a say in the matter . 
  therefore , it 's best to maintain a consistent line on this issue . 
  ehhh what ?? 
  everything kasparov says in that article is bang on . 
  what an excellent read !, 
  were you actually trying to help me make my point ? 
   he was predicting the fall of putin 's regime for over a decade now , not exactly the best fortune teller you can pick . 
  source, 
  yeah . 
   the loyal orange institution , more commonly known as the orange order , is a protestant fraternal organisation based primarily in northern ireland . ^ [ 1 ] it was founded in county armagh in 1795 -- during a period of protestant-catholic sectarian conflict -- as a masonic-style brotherhood sworn to defend protestant supremacy . 
  ** its name is a tribute to the dutch-born protestant king william of orange ** , who defeated the army of catholic king james ii at the battle of the boyne ( 1690 ) . 
  its members wear orange sashes and are referred to as orangemen . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orange_order  under the reign of philip , ** a true persecution of protestants was initiated ** and taxes were raised to an outrageous level . 
  discontent arose and ** william of orange ** ( with his vague lutheran childhood ) stood up for the protestant ( mainly calvinist ) inhabitants of the netherlands . 
  things went badly after the eighty years ' war started in 1568 , but luck turned to his advantage when protestant rebels attacking from the north sea captured brielle , a coastal town in present-day south holland in 1572 . 
  many cities in holland began to support william . 
  during the 1570s he had to defend his core territories in holland several times , but in the 1580s the inland cities in holland were secure . 
  william of orange was considered a threat to spanish rule in the area and was assassinated in 1584 by a hired killer sent by philip . ^ [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 6 ]  william was succeeded by his second son maurits , ** a protestant who proved an excellent military commander . 
  ** his abilities as a commander and the lack of strong leadership in spain after the death of philip ii ( 1598 ) gave maurits excellent opportunities to ** conquer large parts of the present-day dutch territory . 
  ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_orange-nassau#the_dutch_rebellion and that 's how it all started ... with the house of orange . 
  this is also why our football team wears orange .
