  a better understanding of why 9/11 happened is crucial as well , because men like keith alexander and michael hayden unscrupulously exploit 9/11 to get support for their policies . 
  hayden did it in his debate alongside dershowitz against greenwald and ohanian ( reddit co-founder for those who do n't know ) when that has been achieved , europe can follow america 's lead . 
   oh come on ... you have to be joking , right ? 
  you should read this . 
  it 'll shock you . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/comingout#wiki_past_coming_out_stories_that_didn.27t_go_well some kids who tell their parents that they no longer believe in god are put into what ca n't be described as anything other than `` prison camps '' for re-indoctrination . 
  others responded and gave you sources you 're not responding to . 
  which includes a surprisingly large number of europeans , including my fellow countrymen . 
  they will argue in favor of putin and against their own 200 dead compatriates while regurgitating propaganda soundbites i immediately recognize .

'', 
   naftogaz urged its `` hungarian partners to respect their contractual obligations and eu legislation '' . 
   `` neither eu countries nor ukraine should be put under political pressure through energy blackmail , '' naftogaz said on its website . 
  dammit i was on a roll here ... did you have to rain on my pole-celebration parade ? 
  thanks for the added info . 
  you guys across the pond always seem to have these incredibly detailed assessments , how do you do it ? 
  why yes , yes i did . 
  it 's a fun site !, 
  what is an armchair general to do when he wants intel ? 
  so , are you going to make your case or are you just going to stick to tendentious but vague remarks ? 
  from the article :  if putin 's claim on warsaw and bucharest is false , then why did he make it ? 
   baev said that while sabre-rattling might scare `` armchair generals '' real generals know the threat is not credible . 
  that must be a pretty emotional thing to do . 
  i 'm no friend of putin supporters , but what 's there to be gained from turning it in ? 
  is it more like a symbolic `` fuck you '' - gesture ? 
  polish forces in afghanistan : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:%c5%bbo%c5%82nierze_1_kompanii_zgrupowania_bojowego_b_strzeg%c4%85_reaktywowanego_mostu_na_drodze_a1_%28-01%29.jpg they 're ranked 18th : http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=poland they 're a force to be reckoned with . . 
  they allude to this vaguely in this article . 
  bucharest is seen as much more difficult to reach than warsaw . 
  it looks like bucharest is almost surrounded by mountains , so i get that . 
  do n't really know about warsaw , but i still maintain that it 's unwise to just look at poland as if the poles themselves are not a force to be reckoned with . 
  we 're talking 40 million people and a modern , well-trained and equipped military . 
  unfortunately warsaw is close to the belarussian border but still . 
  the whole analysis mentions nato , planes , cruise and even nuclear missiles , but no mention of what the polish military or its people would do . 
  as if they do n't even factor in the equation . 
  ( although i do understand , of course , that poland is a nato member ) i think the poles would react with unimaginable fierceness , and i think they would even consider counterinvading russia . 
  i think that as an armchair reddit general , that is . 
  well , shit . 
  thanks, 
  look , i 've had these discussions many times now . 
  and each and every time these utterly stupid `` objections '' come up . 
  it gets really old really fast . 
  one . 
  signing a contract does n't invalidate the law . 
  two . 
  `` sovereign nations involved '' does n't matter , if that were the case , and it 's not . 
  people who bring up `` breach of gazprom 's contract '' are , without exception , pushing russian propaganda . 
  every time . 
  what 's your excuse ? 
  however , putin is by far the biggest threat to europe , which is where i reside . 
  the gazprom contract 's resale prohibition clauses are very probably illegal under eu anti-trade law . 
  non-interventionists always have the luxury of a theoretically morally superior position . 
  i hardly see non-interventionists with a non-absolutist outlook instead of rigid dogma . 
  the correct answer should be : sometimes you should intervene and sometimes you should n't . . 
  if only you 'd be a little less tolerant toward the eco-nazis who are shutting down all the nuclear plants . 
  i 'm not saying it 's definitively possible for him to get it closed , but he knows how to deal with a stubborn congress : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_states_federal_executive_orders#barack_obama_.282009.e2.80.93present.29 i 'm not suggesting obama can close guantanamo bay with an executive order , but when he really , really wants to get something done , he tends to find a way to get it done . 
  which makes me doubt his commitment to closing it down . 
  in fact , i question the relationship between his words and his deeds in general , when it concerns matters that go against the real status quo . 
  his pre-presidency speech on mass surveillance is a huge embarrassment today . 
  anything known about the cause already ? 
   barely any of your criticisms explained that fear . 
  it 's the writing on the wall , none of these things ( save for annexation , invasion ) by themselves hold particular sway , but the convergence of all of them along with a war craving mood ( otherwise explain the  84 % poll ratings putin has ) among the russian populace is what makes the case . 
   this is where tu quoque is not a fallacy . 
  unless you explain why homophobia and xenophobia are not a problem without pointing to other countries who have similar problems , then yes , it is a logical fallacy . 
   crimea was not annexed crimea was annexed . 
   crimea voted . 
  crimea can only vote to secede with the permission of the ukrainian government . 
  this is international law . 
  having russian troops take the municipal buildings and * forcing * a referendum is unacceptable and illegal . 
  it appears that legality , morality and normal international relations is something the russians must learn anew . 
  otherwise , surely you do n't mind if chechnya secedes after armed muslim gangs with balaclavas take and hold various government buildings . 
   the estonian abduction is a he said she said situation , but of course you already decided what happened . 
  yes , i have . 
  ( because in the eu , we still have media we can generally rely on ), 
   no , more like oligarchy . 
  putin is not alone in this . 
  fine . 
  we 'll call it oligarchy . 
  with one very pronounced leader . 
   yeah , putin will come and put polish gays in prison . 
  also , poles are among the most homophobis eu citizens i ever met . 
  tu quoque fallacy . 
   also , it 's a domestic issue , not a foreign relations issue . 
  it 's not a domestic issue , it 's a human rights issue . 
   show me one country in the world without xenophobia . 
  tu quoque fallacy . 
   besides , people who travelled russia pretty much say that they felt welcome and i met a lot of those . 
  i 'm not just talking about tourists . 
   again , right wing assholes are a trend in europe right now . 
  none of them are currently invading and annexing territory under a `` russian world '' doctrine . 
   source pls . 
  crimea pls . 
   aside from one person that may or may not have been kidnapped ( proof ? ), 
  what else you got ? 
  you do n't set the terms . 
   that 's a real threat to world peace lol . 
  yes , kidnapping border guards is a threat to world peace lol . 
   again , domestic issue not if you do it in london , but even then . 
  no , you do n't get to assassinate people inside your own borders without an international backlash . 
  chechnya , yugoslavia . 
  he was in visegrad , 1992 . 
  and now the chetniks and other serbs are in ukraine , helping the russians .
