  besides . 
  france , belgium and the netherlands have nuclear weapons too . 
  not sure about germany . 
   the uk is a nuclear power and a permanent member of the unsc . 
  sure . 
  but so is the united states . 
  also not a part of the eu . 
  important business partner , but not internal market special . 
   when comparing militaries , you need to look at other factors too . 
  yes , like : how well you work together with your partners , which brings me to my next point :  obviously , outside the eu the uk will continue to cyberattack the eu . 
  those days will soon be over . 
  gchq 's methods have been so thoroughly exposed by snowden , they have lost their access to key eu systems . 
  meanwhile , british and american contracters are losing their german principals . 
  in any case , this continued hostile behavior will cost the uk and the us many billions . 
  not anymore after the exit . 
  why would it be ? 
  trade ? 
  yeah , we 'll import and export , and more than with turkey , but in terms of stature , nothing more and nothing less than turkey . 
  militarily ? 
  you guys do n't even have an aircraft carrier . 
  italy 's got two , france 's got one , and spain 's got one . 
  if you 're not conducting cyberattacks on the eu , that is . 
  yes , the uk will be to the eu what turkey is to the eu . 
   this is why the uk should leave the eu as soon as possible . 
  i agree . 
   relations between the uk and reu will improve once we leave . 
  one thing is for certain : the eu will not meddle in the uk 's business any longer , and finally : the uk will have no say in european affairs whatsoever any longer . 
  what we definitely should n't have is a situation where the uk tries to negotiate the benefits back in after the exit . 
  the benefits come with the drawbacks ; it 's both or none . 
  there are different ways of looking at this . 
  perhaps i can tickle your politically correct conscience if i brought up the forced migrations to the baltic states or the forced chinese migrations to nepal ? 
  at what point does a sovereign nation have the right to close its borders to preserve its own cultural integrity ? 
  madness is indeed relative . 
  what putin deems normal for russian domestic consumption i deem madness or mafia tactics . 
  an example : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuqagjga8bu but we already know from putin 's kgb profile when he was stationed in dresden , descibed in his biography , that he has a lowered sense of risk . 
  http://www.forbes.com/sites/riskmap/2014/04/21/would-the-real-vladimir-putin-please-step-forward/ garry kasparov confirmed this in an interview . 
  as for russia 's aggressive probing , i 'm sure you 'll agree that [ kidnapping an estonian police officer ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/tensions-spiral-over-russias-detention-estonian-officer-114459562.html ) and [ pirating a lithuanian ship ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-19/lithuania-says-russia-seized-ship-as-baltic-tensions-grow.html ) are n't `` mapping '' but * bullying * activities . 
  moreover , the airspace and territorial waters intrusions are off the charts and go well beyond mere mapping : http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/03/us-russia-nato-flights-iduskbn0in18420141103 i agree with your frozen conflict assessment . 
  but europe has different priorities . 
  namely , not to allow arbitrary `` border modifications '' , not even by russia , because it sets very , very bad precedent on a continent which drifted to war in the wake of similar `` ethnic protection '' rackets . 
  well to the british public maybe , but what do i really know about farage ? 
  it 's starting to make sense to me now . 
  i think this is about the city of london resisting financial regulations ; something the british government would never dare enact , but the eu would . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grsbfvug5va interesting rants about communists , and the specific targeting of barroso . 
  and now this targeting of barroso : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2len1q/eu_commissioner_barroso_received_money_from/ the city is sending its envoys to stop financial regulation . 
  well , re-read the comment , i 've edited something in . 
  i hypothesized that farage must somehow be connected to the city before i went to wikipiedia , so i did , and yes , indeed . 
  this theory is a good theory . 
  well , i 'm not one to start sourcing zero hedge or `` globalresearch.ca '' or max keiser , or russia today . 
  staying in the internal market is better for the city of london . 
  [ eu internal immigration is a net plus ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-29910497 ) . 
  ( and that 's the bbc ) so can you tell me what it is what farage really wants here ? 
  wait . . how can i not get this . . why have n't i seen this before !, 
  the uk simply wants more control over the eu , and the only way to get it is to terrorize the eu leadership , is n't it ? 
  the uk is n't worried about internal eu immigrants . 
  the uk is worried about african and asian immigrants . 
  it 's just a good bludgeon to try to gain more control over the eu with . 
  ... and the strategy is backfiring !, 
  and who ultimately controls cameron ? 
  the city , of course !, 
  edit : jesus christ ... 
  i 'm on to something here  ** his father was a stockbroker who worked in the city of london financial district . 
  ** a profile on bbc radio 4 said he was an alcoholic [ 14 ] and he left the family home when nigel was five years old . 
  [ 12 ]  farage was educated at dulwich college , a public school in south london . 
  [ 16 ] ** on leaving school in 1982 , he decided not to go to university , but to work in the city , trading commodities at the london metal exchange . 
  ** [ 14 ] initially , he joined the american commodity brokerage firm drexel burnham lambert , [ 16 ] transferring to credit lyonnais rouse in 1986 . 
  [ 16 ] he joined refco in 1994 , and natexis metals in 2003 . 
  [ 16 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nigel_farage#background this is it , is n't it ? 
  wait ... 
  i said `` the city of london will wilt '' ... you proceed to quote me on that and you demand evidence . 
  i source evidence from reuters ... ... and you say none of it is surprising in the first place ? 
  if it was n't suprising , then why ask at all ? 
   how do you know this ? 
  most economist predictions have n't been able to paint a clear picture so i 'd be interested . 
  or is this your own disdain for the uk coming through and clouding things ? 
  i hardly have a disdain for the uk . 
  it 's the populist forces taking it hostage at the moment i have such disdain for . 
  i have similar disdain for the populist nincompoops in my own country . 
  [ reuters - eu exit could wreck uk financial capital , says city lobby group ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/27/uk-britain-europe-idukbrea3q00a20140427 ) as for gchq , what can one say ? 
  terrible entity . 
  how would the uk be any more or less of a tax haven than the united states after a british exit from the eu ? 
  i 'm not making up things here : [ reuters - eu exit could wreck uk financial capital , says city lobby group ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/27/uk-britain-europe-idukbrea3q00a20140427 ) the populist bullshit catching hold in the uk was never about facts in the first place . 
  yes , the uk being more closely allied to the us than to its direct neighbours is a huge problem . 
  not because there 's something wrong with the us ( other than mass surveillance ) but because it shows where the uk 's priorities lie . 
  currently i am for the uk exiting from the eu altogether . 
  the consequences of that would be catastrophic for the uk , but i 'm fine with that at this point . 
  i just want the whinging to stop . 
  the uk has earned dozens of billions of pounds from the internal market and eu internal immigration is a net contributor to the uk ; not a loss . 
  the city of london will wilt . 
  yeah , but imagine you were shit-talking canada and mexico all the time . 
   alexander stubb , finland 's ** anglophile prime minister ** , said he wanted to help mr cameron but ** there were lines that even his closest allies would not cross ** in an eu renegotiation . 
  the guy is ** married ** to a british woman . .  mr stubb , ** who is married to a british lawyer ** , said that european leaders might be able to accommodate some of mr cameron 's other demands through legal opt-outs , but he backed ms merkel 's opposition to a major treaty reform . 
  the uk is losing their closest allies . 
  they are in the wrong , not the rest of the eu . 
  yeah , we 're missing an equivalent to adobe premiere , after effects , cubase , logic , adobe audition , not just bare-bones replacements but actual full-functionality drop-ins . 
  unfortunately , projects with that kind of impact cost a lot of money and tend to require a commercial party behind the effort . 
  :( in lieu of that , you 'll have to make do with wine or even virtualbox . 
  just fyi , gnome and kde are n't distros but desktop environments , kde even call themselves a `` community '' :d . . 
  in any case , distros are usually shipped with a default de , such as kde , gnome , unity ( for ubuntu ) . 
  of course , ** k ** ubuntu ships with kde instead of unity , etc.
