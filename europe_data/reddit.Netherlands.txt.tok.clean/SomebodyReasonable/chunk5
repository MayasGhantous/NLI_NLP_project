   it might even be attributed to post soviet inexactitudes in territorial repartition - kruschev will be blamed in the long term - not putin yes , his decisions ultimately caused crimea to be part of ukraine , but that makes sense , because the main route to get there is via ukraine in the first place . 
  if crimea wanted independence , they could have tried for that ; instead what we have here is annexation . 
  i do n't care for your indifference and downplaying of this crime against international law . 
  russia is paying the price as we speak , consumers and businesses in russia are panicking ; the kremlin is isolated internationally . 
  a typical russian ca n't even book a vacation abroad right now without the fear of being unable to board a flight back . 
  you are saying what any criminal would like to say in a courtroom , as obama once did : `` let 's look forward not backward '' . 
  it 's cheesy and predictable . 
  russia 's crimes will not be and are not excused . 
  anyways though , fuck international law , right ? 
  yes . 
  did you know putin offered a significant sum of money for a * part * of crimea in the pre-maidan trade negotiations ? 
  so what 's actually in it for farage , besides popularity ? 
  is he addicted to political power for the sake of it ? 
  surely in his heart he knows better ? 
  i have difficulty assessing the man as stupid . 
  he has nearly reached his goal . 
  will he follow through ? 
  no , the russian army destroyed donbas .

  if it 's not the russian armed forces then what is it ? 
  yes , they are wrong . 
   ** all 28 member states of the european union believe the separation of the crimea from ukraine to be unacceptable under international law . 
  **  the european parliament rejected the referendum on independence in crimea , which they saw as manipulated and contrary to international and ukrainian law . 
   group of 7 world leaders said that they would not recognize the results of a referendum for ukraine 's crimea region . 
  the leaders called on russia to `` immediately '' halt actions supporting the referendum on crimea regarding its status . 
   united nations on march 15 , ** the united nations security council voted 13 -- 1 ** ( with one abstention : china ) to condemn the referendum , ** but russia vetoed the draft resolution **  the united nations general assembly approved a resolution describing the crimean referendum as illegal . 
  ** one hundred countries voted in favour of approving a un general assembly resolution declaring the crimean referendum illegal ** and affirming ukraine 's territorial integrity . 
  eleven nations voted against , with 58 abstentions .

  this might explain the conundrum to you better , keeping international law and statecraft in mind . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/17/scottish-independence-islands-home-rule you could have a `` neverendum '' -- and guess what : when the faroe islands requested a referendum from scotland , scotland said `` no '' . 
  you should conclude by reading this : http://opiniojuris.org/2014/03/06/can-crimea-secede-referendum/ making matters even worse : significant minorities such as ukrainian loyalists and crimean tatars may flee after the changeover because of intimidation , kidnapping , beatings and torture ; but after they 've been forced out , in retrospect , crimean public opinion will seem more and more unanimous . 
  it 's a perverse self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  do n't worry , you can always *** keep insisting *** you are in the right , and you wo n't be alone : you 'll be in the company of delusional nostalgic russians who think they can change international borders as they see fit . 
  i do n't understand . 
  what will russia pay for annexing crimea and invading and destroying the donbas ? 
  you 're forcing open doors . 
  i am aware , as is everybody else , that european intelligence agencies all work together . 
  and that france 's intelligence agency spies on french citizens . 
  and that the bnd spies on german citizens . 
  and that denmark 's intelligence agency spies on danes . 
  now , here 's the difference . 
  the nsa has 7 surveillance bases in germany . 
  gchq conducts cyberattacks against belgacom . 
  gchq spies on climate talks to gain the upper hand in negotiations . 
  and this is just the tip . 
  ** so besides telling me the obvious , that the netherlands is in nine eyes , that germany is in fourteen eyes , that our intelligence services collaborate with the nsa , can you explain to me what it is that allows gchq to assault and wiretap the eu ? 
  and why it is the eu does n't have 7 surveillance bases in the uk or the usa ? 
  ** the gchq , like the nsa , has a privileged position as opposed to all other services and conducts cyberattacks on supposedly friendly nations . 
  do you deny this ? 
  well , that indeed changes everything . 
  overall , we have little disagreement if at all then . 
  in fact , this is the sort of well-balanced opinion desperately needed . 
  yet , somehow i see you shilling for russia every thread i go . 
  perhaps you 're a black swan and you 're actually sincere . 
  so , i guess i 'll leave it at that . 
   even though germany is furious about us spying they did n't do anything about it this is false . 
  cia head was expelled and a large government verizon contract was cancelled . 
  germany has changed their contra-espionage policy to include the united states and a parliamentary commission is investigating the matter as we speak . 
  i feel much more must be done , but that is n't germane to the conclusion that your claim is false . 
   even though france and germany were against us + uk actions in iraq they did n't do anything about it , and they do n't have to . 
  indignation in us congress over france 's `` betrayal '' was so huge , they renamed their french fries to `` freedom fries '' . 
  they have been spreading the `` french are cowards '' propaganda ever since , and almost the entirety of reddit believes it . 
   even though most of europe agree that snowden did nothing wrong they still will ground plane of foreign president by the request from us . 
  yes , because most of the governments like to spy on their own citizens with the help of the nsa , but they did n't quite understand they were dealing with the devil . 
  this action i condemn . 
  however , you can not cite a few instances of agreement , without considering instances of disagreement and then generalize both into a fantasy of total european subordination . 
   and this leads to some inconsistent policies : full blown sanctions on russia vs some sort of tough ( - ish ) talks about israel . 
  apples and oranges . 
  besides , sweden just recognized palestina . 
  your whataboutism fails again . 
   and please stop shouting `` whataboutism '' i 'm not trying to argue that russia did nothing wrong . 
  yes you are . 
  this was your first comment :  western leaders would be in a much better position to call out people on bullshit if they did n't lied to start wars them selves just a few years ago ... 
  typical whataboutist deflection of guilt . 
   and in this case providing examples is the key of an argument and not a logical fallacy . 
  it most certainly is a logical fallacy . 
  you 're supposed to defend russia 's actions , not try to dismiss or deflect criticism by bringing up supposed transgressions by the `` other side '' . 
  but that 's not even my main objection , that you are committing the soviet propaganda version of a `` tu quoque '' fallacy . 
  my main objection is that you are pretending that the west is monolithic by pretending that if you criticize american foreign policy , your homework is done for today . 
  obviously not . 
  try again . 
  you are trying the exact same thing again , right after being set straight on the pluriformity of the alliance . 
  you do n't get to set arbitrary , unattainable benchmarks . 
   and no one is saying that the west is monolithic . 
  there is literally nothing else the whataboutist pro-russian trolls do all day . 
   it just happens so that due to common history those interests are largely aligned in the same direction except france and the united states have been at odds repeatedly . 
  italy was a black sheep in the alliance due to berlusconi for while , spain has disputes with the uk over gibraltar to the point of uk sending warships ... germany and greece hate each others guts and ireland and the uk do n't really have a friendly history either . 
  germany is furious about the u.s. ' spying . 
  yet all these countries condemn russia 's thuggery unanimously . 
  that is why your `` west '' whataboutism fails , and will keep failing in perpetuity , and why you should n't have brought up iraq , because germany and france were at odds with the u.s. and the u.k. 
  your whataboutism fails , try something new . 
  not just a good day , cake day !, 
  there is no monolithic west : that 's why france and germany did not participate in the second gulf war . 
  this is the achilles heel of pro-russian trolls ' endless whataboutisms . 
  russia stands almost alone in the face of some 30 countries who are fed up with it . 
  only ** one ** of those countries is the united states . 
  the pro-russian troll 's concept of the monolithic `` west '' is the trick they want to use and it 's failing . 
  gchq is , i ca n't put this mildly , a very real enemy of democracy and the eu . 
  by extension , this means the british government is an enemy of democracy and of the eu , and what do you know ?
