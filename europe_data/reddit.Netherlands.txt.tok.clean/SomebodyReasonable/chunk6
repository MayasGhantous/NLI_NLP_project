  they constantly reaffirm this impression with public statements . 
  the eu must act against gchq . 
   if we left the eu then hopefully this would provide quite the incentive for them to stay within london . 
  =d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internal_market, 
  yes , now do you understand what that means ? 
  2005 , shortly before 7/7 , we left before the attacks began , if we had stayed any longer we could have been hit , because we rode the circle line train regularly . 
   i 'm going to assume you 've never been on the eurostar . 
  they scan your bags and check your passports you do realise ? 
  stop being such a dick . 
  i 've been through the chunnel . 
  i had no checks whatsoever . 
  maybe we because we went with a group , in a bus . 
   you 're trying to sound tough but it is n't working . 
  no , there 's really no daylight between the position i 'm taking here and what i really think . 
  there is no posturing involved . 
  this is what reciprocity means . 
   whether the uk stays in the eu or leaves it , can we just be friends ? 
  yes , but taking all the benefits without the drawbacks is n't friendship ; it 's bloodsucking vampirism . 
  [ is this the act of a friend ? 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/british-spy-agency-gchq-hacked-belgian-telecoms-firm-a-923406.html ) [ or this ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/03/un-investigate-wikileaks-claims-uk-spies-infiltrated-climate-talks ) [ or this ? 
  ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/world/british-send-warship-to-gibraltar-amid-border-row-with-spain-20130809-2rle2.html ) friendship is n't a one-way street . 
  amidst the warship sabre-rattling , the cyberattacks and the eu exit rhetoric , you can expect your european `` friends '' across the canal to slowly become fed-up after a while . 
  if you want out of the eu , just step out , and do n't expect to keep the perks . 
  it 's arrogant . 
  i 've been astonished by the hostility over the years , until i realized the uk does n't feel kinship with the european continent , it feels kinship with the americans first and foremost . 
  do i like the brits ? 
  yes , but i do n't understand or appreciate the bellicose posturing . 
  constantly being treated like `` the enemy '' who wants to control the uk starts getting on your nerves after a while , should n't be surprising . 
  there is no point for putin to demand sanctions withdrawn while he 's flouting international law so brazenly . 
  the sanctions are a consequence of his lawless militarism . 
  appealing them is futile . 
   all we want is a bit more control on who we let in . 
  and then we will want the same amount of control over who *** we *** let in from the uk . 
  this means closing down the chunnel for intensive immigration checks . 
  no more easy ride back and forth . 
  in order words , an exit would be the best thing here , instead of the rest of europe adapting eu freedom of movement for the benefit of uk populism . 
   would anyone in europe object to having the uk effectively in the single market through various trade deals and such but not actually in the eu ? 
  i would . 
  why would we give the city of london the continuing benefit of money influx when we can stimulate the same prosperity elsewhere from now on ? 
  why not move the epicenter of the european banking/financial sector to brussels ? 
  i do n't see the need to accomodate the uk any further after their exit . 
  being in the eu comes with certain perks . 
  being out of it loses you those perks . 
  same for workers . 
  the uk refuses eu immigrants ? 
  fine , both sides can start using visas again . 
  we treat immigrants from the uk the same way the uk treats immigrants to the uk . 
  this is fair enough in my opinion . 
  his french was better than his german , i think ; but i 'm including pronunciation . 
  his vocabulary in both is very impressive . 
  but i love parties :-(, 
  apparently your pm bullied a blind guy when he was young . 
  the same island , he said ... * cringe *, 
  i watched and kept cringing harder and harder . 
  come on , the entire studio went silent . 
  everybody was deeply embarrassed . 
  i admire shanahan 's patience and friendliness . 
  it makes the ignorance even more painful . 
  not going with the `` americans are stupid '' thing here , americans know their world economics . 
  this guy is just a stupid prick all by himself . 
  you mean the dutch tourists that come to germany ? 
  have you done a dna-test to confirm you 're not the pm 's son ? 
  that sounds almost exactly like the situation in the netherlands . 
  except our left-wing parties are huge pushovers , so usually they will make concessions . 
  i would . 
  i would n't even take off the flower-decorated basket from the steering wheel before i went mental . 
  so fucked up, 
   i 'm a native dutch speaker myself and i was impressed by the lack of british accent . 
  his mom 's dutch . 
  here 's some background on her : http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2063780/nick-cleggs-mother-hermance-nearly-starved-death-japanese-prison-camp-ww2.html, 
  basically those words are compound words too !, 
  `` kamerhuurvrijstellingscorrectiefactor '' -  * kamer -  room * huur -  rent * vrijstelling -  exemption * correctie -  correction * factor -  factor `` meervoudigepersoonlijkheidsstoornis '' -  * meervoudig -  multiple * persoonlijkheid -  personality * stoornis -  disorder `` rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz '' -  * rindfleisch -  beef * etikettierung -  labeling * \u00dcberwachung -  monitoring/guarding ( literally : watching over ) * aufgaben -  assignments , duties ( could mean something else in this context , whatever ) * \u00dcbertragung -  transfer * gesetz -  law the `` e '' and `` s '' you 're missing in both are just used to connect one word to the other , representing possessive or congruency , etc. 
   i 've been in europe 5 years , and i 'm coming back home this week . 
  if americans have really turned into that which you 're representing . . than not only will i return to germany , but i 'll start agreeing with europeans when they talk smack about americans instead of defending the us ( and ` americans ' ) at every turn - as i have this whole time . 
  tbh - i do n't like how we were just violently subjected to hstark 's anti-euthanasia zealotry - i think it 's typically american to feel so strongly about this because it 's directly related to christian morals so profoundly more important in the u.s. than in europe , e.g. 
  : http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2011/11/2011-values0006.png http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/11/17/the-american-western-european-values-gap/ i know , because my cousin from florida keeps battering us with evangelical flyers . 
  on the other hand , i also appreciate american zealotry now and then ; especially when it comes to commitment to freedom of expression , whether it works out in practice or not . 
  we lack that sort of necessary zealotry , and it results in a society with severely diminished freedom of expression , as is happening in the uk right now . 
  also , i 've begun to understand just how sensitive americans are when it comes to criticism , in other words , i 've gotten more empathy for americans ' feelings . 
  i recently explained this to an american friend who lives here ( and we speak dutch ) and he got emotional and kept thanking me for the rest of the evening . 
  so , i needed to grow but i still can not resist lashing out now and then when the arrogance becomes too overwhelming and people will not even give the slighest inch , not even when presented with empirical evidence . 
  yelling at each other over the internet is fine ; but it 's better to imagine speaking to somebody face-to-face when you 're speaking . 
  it 's hard , but it helps keep your reactions sincere and genuine . 
  and with some much-needed empathy . 
  this melt-down however , should n't matter if you 're american or not . 
  being more genuine and less discriminatory also means to stop being overly aware of people 's ethnic or cultural background . 
  crazy is crazy . 
   op even links to a photo proofing it . 
  i 'm pretty sure this has nothing to do [ with the bakery ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/proofing ) . 
   here are two pictures of her . 
  that gave me the chills ... that poor woman ... 
  why ?? 
  what did we/the bulgarian government/the eu do wrong ? 
  is it related to austerity ? 
  it 's fucked up , what on earth drove her to this ? 
  what do people who do it expect will happen ? 
  it 's about as gruesome a death you can have . 
  there is [ one exception ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/th%c3%adch_qu%e1%ba%a3ng_%c4%90%e1%bb%a9c#mediaviewer/file:th%c3%adch_qu%e1%ba%a3ng_%c4%90%e1%bb%a9c_self-immolation.jpg ) , in terms of . . well , the way it looked . 
  this man , th\u00edch qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c , simply meditated through it until death .
