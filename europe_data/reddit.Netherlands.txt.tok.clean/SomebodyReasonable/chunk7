  yeah , me too , i 'm not even quite sure who our foreign minister is at the moment , or if he 's already permanently left . 
  i * think * it 's bert koenders now . 
  ** edit : ** yeah , it 's bert koenders . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bert_koenders well , here they are both with our secdef ( to the far right ) and rwandan general kazura : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bert_koenders#mediaviewer/file:131128_timmermans_en_hennis_bij_koenders_en_kazura_minusma_%2812771438373%29.jpg, 
  i think my german pronunciation would be slightly better than clegg 's . 
  but then again , how good is my vocabulary and idiom compared to his ? 
  i doubt mine is better . 
  i went to a job fair in amsterdam recently . 
  my english is advanced and i regularly get compliments for my lack of accent ( although i do n't share the enthusiasm , i think it 's a long way still ) but what really makes my day is seeing the germans ' eyes light up when i start speaking german to them , because they 're used to dutch people preferring english over german . 
   mrtomrome  2 years ago  this video was life changing . 
  google translate did n't do too bad , though :  funny that the lingua franca appears to spanish as the deputy prime minister of the uk , the deputy prime minister of spain and yours have a conversation , be . 
  nick clegg really speaks very good spanish !, 
  `` kamerhuurvrijstellingscorrectiefactor '' ( room rent exemption correction factor ) . . is one dutch word i can think of . 
  here 's a word which may actually be used often : `` meervoudigepersoonlijkheidsstoornis '' ( multiple personality disorder ) the germans have ( or had ) `` rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz '' ( something about the law for spending for the monitoring of labels for corned beef ... 
  i 'm not even going to try to make sense of that ) but apparently they 're scrapping it or they 've already scrapped it . 
  you mean , in terms of scary languages ? 
  ;-p usually , and i think this is the case with finnish too , it 's much less scary than it looks once you get to know the language . 
  i terms of other languages , i do n't know . 
  i know a little japanese , but that 's about it . 
  yes , and i have a nice anecdote about clegg and timmermans !, 
  * https://nl-nl.facebook.com/frans.timmermans/posts/583683781654485 translation : * kind of funny that when the vice pm of the uk [ clegg ] , the vice pm of spain and yours truly are having a conversation , spanish is the `` lingua franca '' . 
  nick clegg 's spanish is really very , very good !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdqayc1sr7g&amp;t=1m21s \\  ;-d, 
  i like the fins much , but really though , when i look at the finnish page in instruction manuals and the ingredients section on packaging ... 
  i 'm genuinely terrified . 
  i think only icelandic could be [ worse ] ( http://gearjunkie.com/images/9707.jpg ) . 
  i mean ... 
  [ really ?!, 
  ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fwcnyr7kye/t8ed4h5orui/aaaaaaaaaxa/of2u8qtqkzo/s1600/import+3+018.jpg ) and i have an itch for linguistics , so it 's not like i 'm a lexophobe ;-d ** edit : ** forgot [ welsh ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/67969000/jpg/_67969540_wales_getty.jpg ) . . 
  pfff , nothing compared to our foreign minister frans timmermans . 
  ;-) english , french , german , russian , italian , dutch . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kt6mfqhzvm and i hear he also speaks spanish . 
  yes , i speak to quite a few bosnians and they all say this . 
  i grew up with a serbian friend , years before the war in yugoslavia . 
  i never really asked why he was here . 
  his mum must have had the foresight . 
  i 'm slightly butthurt but the massive irritation with the uk 's behavior supercedes that easily . 
  yes , no , of course not . 
  30 + nations all hating russia in unison for no reason . 
   * the development of the british empire with a depth study ( for example , of india ) https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study published 11 september 2013 ( yes the link above is correct ) plenty of britain 's imperial accomplishments are discussed . 
  oooh victim victim . 
   except you forgot that there was a promise not to expand nato eastward yeah , this one reminds me of hostage negotiation . 
  who cares what the hostage taker demands or what concessions he gets ? 
  as soon as the hostage is free , the hostage taker has absolutely nothing , and rightly so . 
  russia can not tell germany what to do , can you even picture it ? 
  neither can russia tell poland what do , nor tell ukraine what to do . 
  they are * sovereign nations * . 
  this is the fundamental putin illusion . 
  most importantly though , nothing was ever formally agreed or put on paper , so if the russians wanted to have such a guarantee , they should have demanded to have it written down . 
  they did n't . 
  http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141845/mary-elise-sarotte/a-broken-promise on the other hand , the russians violated the budapest memorandum . 
   and some of the other baltics are only being included now . 
  err ... this is false . 
  they 've been members for a decade . 
   the reason they are under threat might well be due to deterioration of the relationship . 
  this is victim blaming , in my opinion . 
  it 's like an ex-husband irate over the fact that his battered ex-wife seeks protection in an abuse shelter . 
  the real blame lies with the history of abuse , not his ex-wife 's rational decisions to seek self-protection , nor with the shelter 's decision to provide it , dishonest promises given to fool the ex-husband or not . 
  about the huey choppers , i guess i did n't get it because you spelled it `` heuy '' ... and i assumed it was some kind of dutch personality i did n't know about . 
  ;-) edit : wording . 
  just gtfo of the eu . 
  we can sink the chunnel , and you lot can stay on the island and have sex with each other until your progeny can lick their elbows . 
  who cares , really ? 
   so basically , quit chatting shit you arsehole . 
  emnel 's point confirmed . . 
   people 's view of whether there is too much immigration is n't based on a hard number . 
  it 's based on their experiences of immigration in their day to day lives . 
  immigration \u2260 eu immigration . 
  moreover , contrary to your title , not 79 % think eu immigration is out of control , but 48 % , as [ discussed above ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l1yn9/79_of_brits_agree_the_dangers_of_uncontrolled/clqp1kb ) . 
  now , we learn those polled ca n't even estimate the actual eu immigration number properly ? 
  this thread is a fraud . 
  that 's right . 
  no mercy . 
  is fighters die , that 's it . 
  i say let them keep their passports and travel to syria , we can bomb them there , and they will never come back . 
  the more the merrier . 
  export a million man army there i say . 
  please paint fluorescent red/yellow targets on the crest of your heads , too . 
  back down from the donbas , give it back to ukraine , and abandon the `` russian world '' doctrine , so no more `` humanitarian interventions '' to help the `` oppressed russians '' . 
  stop threatening nuclear war . 
  hand us over the perpetrators of the mh17 atrocity . 
  cooperate with the investigation and apologize for what you 've done . 
  that is all . 
   should they pay ? 
  yes . 
   will they pay ? 
  who knows ? 
  who cares ? 
   consequences if they do n't pay ? 
  do n't wait for them to pay . 
  just tell them to exit . . everybody 's tired of this . 
   or , maybe , ask our future selves . 
  quite frankly , i do not think our ` leadership ' has played this well at all . 
  our leadership was n't responsible for any of this . 
   nato moving east is probably just a pretext before the second world war , many of the countries in the former warsaw pact were independent . 
  after the war , they found themselves under brutal soviet rule . 
  when they were freed from soviet clutches , the first thing they wanted is to be shielded from future invasions or geopolitical meddling . 
  so they requested nato membership , and nato obliged . 
  the baltic states would have little prospect of survival without nato . 
   but what use did we really have for moving nato into the old east block ?
