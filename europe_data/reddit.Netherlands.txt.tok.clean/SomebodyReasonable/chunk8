  thanks to countries like poland , we gain millions more potential conscripts who are bound by article 5 to protect us . 
  and we them . 
  in the end , this allegiance was setup after wwii to deter invasion , by unifying its member states into a military bloc with mutual defense clauses . 
  it 's not that complicated of a concept , actually . 
   instead of incorporating into nato , couldnt we have pacted those countries . 
  that 's not what those countries wanted , and for good reason , we see now . 
   also , presumably , when the ussr fell , basically a new ( ish ) government was set up . 
  not sure what sort of influence the west had on it , but it didnt work out . 
  no , i do n't think we should have meddled with that , you 're right . 
  naomi klein discusses this in `` the shock doctrine '' . 
   those heuys hanging in the sky standing still what are `` heuys '' ? 
  yeah , i saw `` behind enemy lines '' . 
  i did n't like it that much . 
  the actual stories behind the two shootdowns that happened over yugoslavia are much more interesting . 
  we should fear russian sams . 
  what the serbs were able to do with old material against a stealth aircraft is phenomenal . 
   show me a picture or something . 
  this is not a requirement in journalism . 
   until then the only thing we can do is speculate there is no `` we '' . 
   and that is better done when you try to understand the motives behind the actions . 
  the problem is i could `` speculate '' in a completely different direction , because like you , i 'm not constrained by actual observation , unlike this report , which is n't a product of speculation but of observation . 
  hence , the best thing to do with your `` wondering '' is to flick it aside . 
   and why would wondering about it be irrelevant ? 
  it would be irrelevant if used to call an observation into question on the basis of `` wondering about the motivation behind it '' . 
  the prodigious `` wondering '' in question is weaker than the actual observation . 
   out of curiosity how can he report something , when judging by the info provided by cjfe he is being actively targeted and fled the place overall ? 
  just like all the other journalists who work in war zones : with courage . 
   this is like stories about liberal-gay woman from egypt reporting about `` crimes of the mubarak '' who later turned out to be 20 something british dude writing without pants in his apartment somewhere in britain ( i do n't remember where exactly ) . 
  this is typical gay-obsessed russian frustration . 
   i will not dispute the fact that `` humanitarian convoy '' is quite possibly being used as a front for supplies and whatnot , but this has nothing to do with this so called `` journalism '' . 
  i fail to see how you 've provided convincing arguments so far why not . 
   a clearly interested party is being `` tweeting '' something you are blaming the victim . 
  if only you could disqualify a journalist forever just by attacking him ( he 's `` interested '' from now on , you hear ! ), 
  the russians would be jumping up and down , rubbing their hands with glee . 
  you do n't like a journalist ? 
  knock that fucker in the face , he 's disqualified from now on !, 
  but ... unfortunately for russians , it does n't work like that . 
   with zero factual proof witness testimony reporting , like journalism has been conducted for more than a hundred years . 
   and simply repeating the 2-3 months old story , almost like a copy-paste . 
  that fact that things happen more than once does n't mean that somebody who is reporting it is `` repeating '' things . 
   again , this is not journalism . 
  you would n't know what journalism is , unfortunately . 
  the `` why ' is irrelevant compared to the `` what '' in logic and observation . 
  `` why '' is more a product of your biases and interpretation than anything else , because you 're speculating about human motivations , and `` what '' is a matter of observing ammunition falling out of a truck with your eyes . 
  first of all , kyiv post simply links to zik.ua . 
  second of all , there is absolutely nothing wrong with journalist reporting without photos , and nothing wrong with eyewitness reports . 
  this is how journalism has been done for over a hundred years . 
  this is the journalist in question : [ ukrainian journalist oleksiy matsuka chosen for cjfe 's international press freedom award ] ( http://jpress.journalism.ryerson.ca/jsource/ukrainian-journalist-oleksiy-matsuka-chosen-for-cjfes-international-press-freedom-award/ ) [ reporters without borders - information heroes - oleksiy matsuka ] ( http://heroes.rsf.org/en/oleksiy-matsuka/ ), 
  this does n't necessarily inspire much confidence about the iq and literacy of ethnic russians and passport-carrying russians in the `` donetsk people 's republic '' . 
   as a great nationalist philosopher once said , `` it 's better to wear the helmet of a red army soldier than to live on a diet of hamburgers in brooklyn '' . 
  that 's one of the most retarded things i 've ever heard . 
  at least in brooklyn you 'll be officially acknowledged dead and properly buried with your actual name when you kick it . 
   similarly , for the people of ukraine , it 's better to live side by side with their slavic brothers than to surrender their cultural heritage and economic destiny to the eu and america . 
  by that logic , south korea should surrender to the north . 
  because they 've got family members there . 
  i 've heard this `` brothers and family members '' rhetoric before . 
  it 's definitely a propaganda soundbite . 
  keep going . 
  wow , i had a look through your comment history ... let 's just say you look like someone who 's in denial that they are madly in love with ukip . 
  there 's nothing but ukip , ukip , ukip in your history , and you even link to their website multiple times . 
  yet you deny you love them . 
  it 's like schoolyard puppy love . 
   so-called european leaders that bend their will to american foreign policy are the traitors and the day they are brought to justice is swiftly approaching . 
  like france and germany in 2003 ? 
  guess what the uk did ? 
  anyways , you 're a nutter , not going to waste time on that , no . 
   america 's puppets in brussels and your flair says anti-eu . . just as i thought . . the ukip traitors are upset they ca n't be russia 's little stooges and participate in their crimes . 
  maybe you should start a russia-independence party instead , you 'd be a much better nationalist . 
  exactly ... and since they 're my neighbors , i 'm extremely uncomfortable with these developments , as i am with many developments in my own country , too . 
  but most people ca n't take criticism of their country , nowhere have i noticed this more than on reddit . 
  one problem with the airport : it does n't work anymore ;p, 
   that depends what you mean by `` working '' . 
  if they happen to be pro-russian , there 's nothing legally wrong with that . 
  the current `` election '' they 're observing is thought of as illegal in the eu . 
  also , i did n't immediately say that what they 're doing is illegal , but politically untenable . 
  hence they should all step down . 
   if they are however receiving funds from the russian state in order to be pro-russian , then there 's an issue . 
  this is not the only criterion . 
  if they work against the eu sanctions regime , if they operate as an agent involved in russian violations of international law , they ought be facing consequences . 
  i do n't quite understand why you think the narrow boundary you described is binding or authoritative , unless you have source you can convince me with . 
  otherwise , i think you 're soft-peddling these men intentionally . 
  ukip voters and vlaams belang voters , for example , will be upset , and they should be , because the people they voted for are thugs and traitors . 
  pay close attention to what i said . 
  i did n't say it was true . 
  i did n't say i believed it . 
  i did n't say i was defending it . 
  i told you , quite explicitly , that many revelations in the snowden archives are far worse than this . 
  that using the phrase `` conspiracy theory '' to refer to mass surveillance excesses in no longer appropriate . 
  *** that *** is what i said . 
  no more no less . 
  by the way , cryptome is not a `` conspiracy website '' , you ignorant knob . 
   http://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2013/12/confusion-alleged-gchq-nsa-backdoor-bt-fttc-modems.html  plus this story was debunked ages ago , *** by people with knowledge on the subject rather than keyboard warriors wanting to victimise themselves . 
  *** that 's a bold statement , for an ignorant . 
  as an expert in this field , which you decidedly are n't , i have screened your `` debunking '' link several times now , and have found errors and half-truths . 
  this is the full paper by the guys analyzing the bt modems : http://cryptome.org/2013/12/full-disclosure.pdf *** it , too , contains errors and half-truths . 
  *** however , their paper is very detailed and *** much of it is technically accurate and very interesting *** . 
  the most important error is the assumption that bt would n't be stupid enough to assign 30/24 to its internal modem-side network . 
  apparently they are , and this may be apparent from the ping times , as well as from various traceroute techniques , had the authors attempted them . 
   furthermore , you really did n't need to be rude in replying to me . 
  yes , i definitely do need to be rude .
