  if you do n't know what you 're talking about , you should most definitely shut up . 
   try opening a discussion rather than calling me an `` ignorant '' ( which is n't to be used as a noun btw ) . 
  while in this context its use was intended with a certain poetic liberty , it actually can be :  ignorant \\ ig `` no * rant \\ , n.  a person untaught or uninformed ; one unlettered or unskilled ;  an ignoramous . 
   [ 1913 webster ]  did i for this take pains to teach  our zealous ignorants to preach ? 
   [ 1913 webster ] see that `` n '' ? 
  that means `` noun '' . 
   i do n't want to argue with you on this , so do n't reply . 
  i will be the judge of that . 
   i 'm not pro-gchq , but this particular story is largely false . 
  even though it contains errors , you do n't understand what you 're talking about , so you 're simply not in a position to establish that . 
  the problem here is that we may be dealing with a `` true lie '' , that is : while this specific case leaves much to be desired in terms of establishing a direct link to gchq , *** what 's much more important is that the current technical infrastructure of isp-supplied broadband modems and their provisioning allows for all sorts of remote control and private lan intrusion *** ... and from the snowden documents , we know that routers , whether commerical or private , are subject to subversion by nsa , and the nsa has `` special relationships '' with manufacturers . 
  * https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/01/headwater_nsa_e.html * https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/01/schoolmontana_n.html the problem remains that you have no expertise and do n't know what you 're talking about , so your assessment of this dossier is misleading and distracting . 
  *** regardless *** of the errors , paragraphs of paranoid speculation or otherwise , *** there is plenty of evidence in the snowden files of nsa/gchq subversion of routers and modems *** . 
  moreover , and i 'll say it one last time ... everybody knows , even your denialist buddies over at / r/unitedkingdom confirm : isps have full backdoor access to your cpes . 
  and that includes your stb . 
  http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/frank_creyelman translation : frank creyelman ( born in buggenhout , august 10th , 1961 ) , is a belgian flemish nationalist politician who has represented the policies of the flemish block/flemish interest ( `` vlaams blok '' ) in the senate and subsequently in the flemish parliament , since 1995 and who is also party chairman for het vlaams blok in the city council of mechelen . 
  in 2014 , he was involved in a scandal for being drunk while visiting crimea . 
  -- these people are working for the russians and need to be protested and ousted from their civic duties . 
  i just remembered `` sitting '' is slang for being jailed in nl as well . 
   in donetsk , the main rebel-held city in ukraine 's industrial south-east , afp reporters saw about 20 trucks , some carrying anti-aircraft guns , ** heading towards the government-held airport ** , although it was not clear whether these were new forces . 
  ** [ i called it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l11wf/euromaidan_press_why_is_ukraine_holding_on_to/clqfxnn ) **, 
  when has nato ever been involved in military action related to the defense of a member except for shortly after 9/11 , when article 5 was activated ? 
  the popularity cult is quite pathetic , actually . 
  they 're trying too hard . 
  i wo n't deny obama has some severe credibility issues , but poroshenko is not afraid of putin , and neither are most european leaders . 
  they 're just annoyed with him . 
  then again , there 's a chance the artist is hiding a double meaning in plain sight , like was rumored about [ matvey manizer 's bronze sculptures ] ( http://static.tonkosti.ru/images/0/06/%d0%97%d0%b0%d0%bb_%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%bd%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b8_%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%82%d1%80%d0%be_%d0%9f%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%89%d0%b0%d0%b4%d1%8c_%d0%a0%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%bb%d1%8e%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b8,_%d0%9c%d0%be%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b2%d0%b0.jpg ) in ploshchad revolyutsii . 
   do you think that is because of russian propaganda or the fact if ukraine is blamed the netherlands wont be expected to respond as much ? 
  interesting question . 
  what i realized earlier today , or perhaps it was yesterday , it crossed my mind that some europeans , notably germans , british and dutch people , are vulnerable to intellectual flattery , that is , if you reinforce their arrogant superiority feelings , they will `` thank you '' by believing your information instead of the more mundane mainstream explanation . 
  you are targeting left-wing non-interventionists who already have a strong ( and oftentimes justified ) mistrust of their own authorities . 
  also , the netherlands and ukraine are making the same critical mistakes the u.s. made after 9/11 : arrogantly dismissing public concern and questions arising because `` you do n't need to respond to silly conspiracy theorists '' . 
  yes you do . 
  you need to constantly , relentlessly pound your audience with facts ( do not use `` true lies '' , ever , just the facts ) , if they fund a `` documentary '' where they fire a board cannon at a passenger plane hull , then finance your own antidote experiment . 
  start a wiki debunking russian myths , and be as open and transparent about your findings as possible . 
  be constantly aware of what sort of statements ( or lack of ) you make the russians will exploit when citing them back to your own populations . 
  the local authorities do n't understand how propaganda wars work , and how the russians are experts in scratching the european ( and american ) conspiracy itch . 
  yes , i felt like venting too , but when i was done venting , i felt like i was looking at my own text as a disturbed rant . 
  time to hit `` edit '' , heh . 
  oh , will you come off it already . 
  i let it slide , you 're still going . 
  silly as it sounds , infighting is just what putin wants . 
  unload your critiques , i 'm fine with it . 
  i just ran into this map : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:us_nuclear_strike_map.svg posting it for relevancy , no other reason . 
  ha ha ha ha ha . 
  again with the irony , vladimir ? 
  edit : screw it , not taking this bait . 
  question though , ca n't you follow this logic , riding along with russian troops all the way to warsaw ? 
  i suspect the [ russian convoy entering donetsk ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l0esg/video_of_huge_russian_convoy_entering_donetsk_and/ ) means putin is going to try to take donetsk airport . 
  both sides regard it as a symbol . 
   i 'm already willing to lose my hair & piss blood for the baltics , but let 's not keep moving the goal posts , especially when russia considers limited nuclear strikes to be `` de-escalation '' . 
  yes , i 'm sorry , i forgot the americans want no part of this . 
  i understand , i 'm sure we can arrange that europe goes in with what we have , even though it is n't as overpowering as with u.s. participation . 
  we ca n't ask the americans to give their lives for europeans . 
  but , as you can see , the italians , the french , the germans . . they do n't have the stomach to go in either . 
  they 'd rather wait until poland or the baltics get attacked . 
  clearly , pretentious latin and poetry is your thing , so let me add my latin : * veniant omnes * . 
  what is at stake here is the psychological component of drawing a definitive line which can not be crossed . 
  the simplest geopolitical and historical analyses come back to this point over and over . 
  the same principle applies on a macro , meso and micro scale . 
  you want to be a doormat ? 
  then be one . 
  if 200 americans had died on that flight , you and i might not be here today . 
  we have been tolerant enough . 
  [ ukraine blood bucket challenge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8gn8kjxi5q ), 
  okay , so let 's go *** all the way *** with the sanctions then . 
  open up the floodgates . 
  the kremlin clearly is n't paying enough attention yet . 
  oh , the poetry . 
  200 of my people were slaughtered by these russian fucks . 
  you think we 're all happy about that ? 
  an australian passenger , we now know *** was found wearing an oxygen mask *** , meaning he witnessed the *** entire fall on the way down , while strapped in his seat *** . 
  spare me the moral high horse . 
  you just have to move the goal posts so you can get a `` no '' , do n't you ? 
  what part of the question and answer was n't clear ? 
  i called for * nato intervention * , and i answered i would enlist if they wanted me as soon as that happened . 
  i 'm not volunteering for the ukrainian army , and i never said i would . 
  but the fact that the `` non-interventionists '' always assume people calling for nato intervention to be chickenhawks is clearly a mistake on their part . 
  poroshenko is treating his frontline troops as cannon fodder . 
  he 's not capable of producing a dent in russian lines . 
  that 's why nato intervention is necessary in the first place . 
  yes , i actually will , you fucking knob . 
  why do you pussies always assume that wo n't happen ? 
  remember the reports about the `` cyborgs '' of donetsk airport ? 
  i suppose they 're going to take the airport now . 
  okay , let 's not send nato troops into ukraine . 
  if ukrainians do n't want it then obviously we should n't do it . 
  they can have the russians instead . 
  let 's send nato troops into ukraine then . 
  because this man will never stop . 
  ha ha ... who can say poles do n't have a sense of humor ? 
  hmmm , if i went to poland i would want to see nature and old city centers , i think . 
   how is your everyday experience in the nl ? 
  it seems people are very effectively targeted by russian propaganda . 
  in turn , i can very effectively deprogram them because of a decade of experience looking at how information is handled by internet audiences . 
  ( i had to deprogram a friend infected with the `` ukrainian su-25 shot down mh17 '' meme , somehow the russians got to him ;-) but i do n't have the influence other media have . 
  the last investigative report i saw made the critical error of lending undue weight to the fringe . 
   did the awful handling of mh17 change the perceptions of dutch people in your experience ? 
  i would say at a basic level , people realize that putin is dangerous . 
  but the naivete is overwhelming .
