anyone else amused by the irony of the breasts being censored ? 
  a quick google suggests it was originally * sacs-bh\u00e9arla * . 
  at some point in history the * sacs * part got dropped , leaving * b\u00e9arla * . 
  which is weird , because that just means `` language '' . 
  and koeieuier . 
  ( cow udder ) also : herfstschrijver ( autumn writer ) . 
  we 'll send you a decent cheese shop if we can have a half decent german bakery over here . 
  hell , one of those bread-dispensers from aldi will do . 
  that would be the [ python ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/python_ ( efteling \\ ) ) . 
  ( why am i not surprised all these have entries in the german wikipedia ? ), 
  and posting that picture would be appreciated , 
  [ no , that 's the efteling as well . 
  ] ( https://www.google.nl/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=papier+hier&amp;tbm=vid ) and depending on how long ago you splinter was , [ that rollercoaster ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/pegasus_ ( efteling \\ ) ) has been torn down and they 've since built a [ new one ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/joris_en_de_draak ) . 
  that would be making things worse , yes . 
  but he appears to be updating as we speak , so lets give him the benefit of the doubt . 
  he seems to be open to criticism , which is a good thing . 
  sexbierum was n't built in one day , as they say . 
  nah , he just wanted to join the so-you-want-to-visit bandwagon while it is still a thing . 
  he did alright . 
  i really liked the food bit . 
  but he could have done a lot better . 
  might i suggest ( in no particular order ) : limburg as whole ( hills ! ), 
  the old hanseatic towns : deventer , zutphen et . 
  [ the efteling ] ( https://m.efteling.com/nl/ ) a couple of castles ( i do n't know . 
  there are [ plenty ] ( http://www.kasteel.nl ) arnhem ( a bridge too far ) biesbosch ( or some other nature reserve ) the wadden islands the afsluitdijk the hunebedden, 
  you could have easily called this * so you want to visit holland * . 
  showing only utrecht , a polder en the deltawerken to represent all the sights in the 10 other provinces is bit meagre . 
   burger king & mcdonalds are mostly considered subpar fastfood , only suitable for when you 're very drunk or very poor . 
  i disagree , or at least it stops being true as soon as you have kids . 
  there are loads of middle class families eating at mcdonalds at dinner time . 
  you 'd get your take-out from your local snackbar , but you would n't necessarily want to sit down and eat there . 
  `` loosely linked '' is understating it a bit . 
  it was a massive brain drain from all of the southern netherlands to mostly one province ( holland ) . 
  all that knowledge suddenly concentrated in one spot is bound to ( and did have ) a profound effect . 
  relevant side note : ever wondered why you 've only heard of painters and writers from that period , but no sculptors ? 
  that 's mainly because only the catholic church had use for/could afford a masterpiece . 
  most sculptors stayed put in the south . 
  not necessarily . 
  the [ danish golden age ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_golden_age ) never did anyone any harm . 
  well , apart from the danes themselves . 
  yeah , i would n't start that argument if i were you . 
  i 've recently been reminded that most * hollandse nieuwe * herring are caught around denmark and norway . 
  apart from deep fried pizza , what other typically scottish takeout food is there ? 
  who knows ? 
  he 's never been to one . 
  has n't been practiced ? 
  your us of a has been trying it for a couple of decades now . 
  how did that work out for you ? 
  captain future had [ the most epic soundtrack ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dcjhpetolg0 ) of any tv show ever . 
  not really . 
  in a case of war not all conscripts will be called . 
  no use in having pregnant women wadling around , or people in non-military but crucial occupations , just to name a couple . 
  apart from that , you seem to assume that every conscript will be in a combat role , which will hardly be the case . 
  i spent three years of my life in glasgow . 
  easily the best city i 've lived in . 
  seriously . 
  it 's got a bad reputation , but it 's a lot prettier than people give it credit for and it certainly feels more alive than the tourist trap that edinburgh has become . 
  name a scottish band , artist or whatever from the past 20 years and chances are they 're glaswegian . 
  neither norway nor israel draft * all * their women at once . 
  that might be the reasoning behind this policy - i do n't know - but israel and norway seem to be doing just fine with female draftees . 
  probably , but the finns generally are n't in the business of * selling * alcohol . 
  that 's what the ferry to estonia is for . 
  oh , i assume everybody here knows it 's a scam . 
  i 'm also assuming the scammers are n't actually from greece , so replying in greek would be a nice way to waste their time and could potentially confuse them to no end . 
  trolling the scammers , like . 
  could one of our greek contributors reply in greek ? 
  i 'm curious as to see what happens ... 
  it 's more like everybody else seems too young . 
  do their parents know they 're on the internets ? 
  denmark : adams \u00c6bler / adam 's apples . 
  i always wonder why not more people have seen this one . 
  if you like your comedies black and depressing , this one 's for you . 
  extremely flawed characters in a beautifully filmed danish country side . 
  a synopsis of the story would be : a neo-nazi tries to bake an apple pie - but that 's not really what it 's about . 
  go watch it . 
  that 's as close as you and i will ever get . 
  oh i 'm not arguing against you . 
  the lack of any consonants to speak of and the slurring of all the vowels would make the parliament sound like a babbling brook . 
  i say , let 's do this . 
  make europe sound like guden\u00e5en !, 
  you could n't even get the norwegians to pronounce * r\u00f8dgr\u00f8d med fl\u00f8de * correctly . 
  i would n't bet on danish becoming the next lingua franca . 
  as a word , * furrify * is actually very pretty and fun to say . 
  as a concept , it pretty much scares the crap out of me ... 
  because translating is hard . 
  there 's a reason we employ profesional translators and not just ask the first person we find who speaks said language . 
  i agree . 
  * do n't worry about it . 
  if you do want to show of like me ( or that french guy ) , just cut and paste your perfectly good english into google translate . 
  that 's actually good old germanic shining through . 
  later all unstressed vowels in most germanic languages would turn into a schwa ( the ` uh ' - sound ) . 
  the scandinavian languages on the other hand would retain them one way or another ( danish being the notable exception - that turned into one long string of schwas ... ), 
   one thing that always surprises me is that anti immigration parties tend to be adamantly opposed to spending money to try to reduce the problem at source . 
  anti-immigration parties would n't get any votes if there 's no immigration . 
  they ( and other one-issue parties ) paradoxically are dependent on the problem they are claiming to solve . 
  in actuality they have the least incentive to solve it . 
  [ among a lot of others , yes . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_english_words_of_dutch_origin ), 
  true , without context it 's hard to translate . 
  does n't really matter though .
