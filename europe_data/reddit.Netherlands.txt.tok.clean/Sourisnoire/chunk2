  the point i was making is that english , dutch and all the other germanic languages have a rather complicated system for expressing future ( and past ) tenses . 
  i think that still stands . 
  nah , not really . 
  * `` i will be walking home '' * would usually be translated as something like : * `` ik zal naar huis lopen '' * . 
  slightly less confusing , because you only need one extra verb to express the future , but still . 
  i 'd say they 're of comparable difficulty - just slightly different . 
  but they * are * hard for non-english speakers . 
  take a sentence like * `` i will be walking home '' * . 
  you need three ( ! ), 
  verbs , two of which are totally unrelated to the actual action of walking , to express that you are going to do some walking in the future . 
  it might come naturally to english-speakers , but it really is a weird way of expressing a future tense . 
   goose/geese , deer/deer , ox/oxen those are n't loanwords . 
  those are actually leftover plurals from older stages of english . 
  in a way they are * more * english than your regular s-plurals . 
  oh , i completely agree that there should n't be an authority that determines whether or not your opinion is valid or not . 
  that 's not what i 'm arguing . 
  people should decide for themselves - but if someone * is * just making noise , that person should be called out on that . 
  telling someone to shut up is also free speech , after all . 
  my opinion is that if someone keeps drawing attention to a problem in a way that exacerbates the problem ( which wilders is doing by showing the same cartoons over and over ) , while making no attempt to acctually solve it , people are in their full right to tell him to shut up . 
  personally , i disagree . 
  i think everything you say should have a purpose , otherwise you 're just making noise . 
  and wilders ' words do serve a purpose . 
  but it is n't a very constructive purpose and it is n't supposed to be . 
  just like there 's no right not to be offended , there 's no obligation to offend . 
  the ` right ' to not be offended is offset by wilder 's compulsive need to offend , though . 
  it serves no purpose , at all , other than attracting votes . 
  take it as a compliment . 
  apparently your food is so good , you had to borrow somebody elses worst dish . 
  it 's not that bad actually . 
  although i must admit i 've only ever had it at about 4 in the morning and never sober . 
  brilliant . 
  cheers !, 
  i lived in denmark for a while and following local politics was always rather confusing . 
  all parties were usually referred to by a single letter in the danish media and figuring out which letter belonged to which party was always a bit of a hassle . 
  would it be a lot of trouble to add those to your post ? 
  i know i can get them from your links , but this would make a nice overview for other confused foreigners . 
  technically the current king * is * a far relative to the oranje-nassaus . 
  i say , let him have a go at applying for a job as a bin man and see what happens . 
  actually , i do n't think that ortography of yours works in your favour . 
  it 's one of the least phonological i know - not as irregular as english maybe , but at the very least on par with french or danish . 
  it 's a beautiful language , and it looks beautiful when written , but if you 'd only encountered the one , you 'd think the other was a completely different language . 
  although it has relatively few speakers , faroese is in no danger of dying out . 
  being stuck on a couple of rocks in the atlantic does have it 's advantages . 
  this particular sceptic tank is swiss . 
  a lot is wrong with people , but that 's not important right now . 
  the original election poster for this populist right wing party in denmark read `` stop isis '' . 
  populists are generally fair game to be made fun of , so someone decided to add an extra t and i with photoshop . 
  `` stop isis '' thus becomes `` stop tis i is '' * stop pee in ice cream * . 
  so alas , no danish nationwide ice creaming peeing problem . 
  just a silly juvenile joke . 
  at least it 's interestingly ugly . 
  ours is boringly monotonous . 
  exactly . 
  hence the ` relatively conservative ' . 
  one of your viking ancestors still would n't be able to make very much of it . 
  that would n't be true either , though . 
  it has actually changed considerably . 
  now if they 'd called it `` relatively conservative '' , i suppose i could live with that . 
  does n't make for good headlines though . 
   a rare language that dates back to the viking age yes , it does make a dying dialect sound cool and all , but * all * scandinavian languages date back to the viking age . 
  nobody denies the existence of jewish people . 
  some people might dispute the legitimacy of israel , but that too is not inherently anti-semitic . 
  all of that is pretty obviously anti-israel , but none of that is inherently anti-semitic . 
  i 'm going to unfriend every fin i know on facebook . 
  according to the dutch [ wiki ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/lijst_van_exoniemen ) , you 're missing the following for the netherlands : den briel - * brill * hoek van holland - * hook of holland * ( or * the hook * ) leiden - * leyden * vlissingen - * flushing * most - if not all - of them have n't been relevant for about four centuries , but nevertheless there you go . 
  * every single stair hall in helsinki * would have made a more fitting title . 
  they 're beautiful though . 
  especially love that more restrained approach to jugendstil finland seems to take . 
  and half of the population is in [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:depil_1.bor%c3%b0oy.jpg ) picture . 
  it actually is - it 's just spelled differently . 
  the ending - je has got the same etymology as - i\u00eb . 
  ca n't have a thread with tree-poetry without mentioning [ rilke ] ( http://www.rilke.de/gedichte/verkuendigung.htm ) . 
  as for pictures of european trees , [ some people are waaaay ahead of you ] ( http://www.monumentaltrees.com/en/europe/ ) . 
  yeah , we recognise the american santa , but i do n't think there 's a kid in the netherlands that believes he exists . 
  he 's basically in the same league as the easter bunny . 
  sinterklaas on the other hand is as real to them as jesus is to christians . 
  more real probably , because at least sinterklaas has his own annual tv-show . 
  its * baby * jesus after all . 
  depends on who 's asking . 
  if you 're estonian : not very ( but you would n't be asking ) . 
  if you 're hungarian : you 've got a head start . 
  for everyone else : very , very hard . 
  the only thing that makes it slightly easier is the spelling which is very phonetic . 
   although with more orthographic regularity ( i assume ) you 'd think so , but not really . 
  danish ortography is only slightly more regular than english , but the spelling is not very intuitive , and based for a large part on etymology rather than pronunciation . 
  swedish and norwegian are more phonetic in that regard . 
  danish pronunciation itself is notoriously hard . 
  you should n't be discouraged right away though : the grammar is probably the easiest of all the germanic languages . 
  well yes . 
  but it is , so it is n't . 
  both malaysia and the netherlands continued to trade with russia after mh17 was shot down , even though the concensus in both countries is that the russians where involved . 
  so yes , disagree . 
  culturally the dutch and the germans are very alike . 
  a lot of overlap in traditions , taste in music , that sort of thing . 
  which is logical - there 's always been a cultural and linguistic continuum between the two countries and the border has always shifted back and forth ( our biggest province , gelderland , is even named after a town now in germany ) . 
  the border between germany and the netherlands has for the most part of history been political , not cultural . 
  on top of that , economically the netherlands are basically just another bundesland . 
  i can see where he comes from though . 
  we 've been very much oriented towards the us ( less so the uk ) after wwii . 
  but then again , so has germany .
