  you might like to think that , but that 's absolute nonsense . 
  there are three official languages in belgium . 
  everyone always seems to forget about the german speaking belgians . 
  predominantly english , yes , but hardly all of it . 
  / r/denmark and / r/thenetherlands for example are for the most part in danish and dutch respectively . 
  well , / r/belgium already is mostly in english , so i can see where they got the idea ... 
  not that safe with trump 's stance on climate change ... 
  that and scandinavian murder dramas , filmed exclusively in the dark . 
  rain and snow are preferable , but optional . 
  [ no helmets even ] ( https://thornews.com/2014/06/07/why-is-this-the-only-existing-viking-age-helmet/ ) . 
  well , getting it right saves you from being corrected by spelling nazis . 
  other than that , not really . 
  if the scottish get their referendum there might very well be a shortbread-shortage in ' 17 . 
  also , technically a pilot whale is n't a whale but a kind of dolphin . 
  [ or this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j03cdhbjgw8 ) . 
  edit : non-dutch - please do n't click . 
  it 's slightly embarrasing . 
  well , that explains the abuse you got . 
  a bit like [ l'auberge espagnole ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283900/ ) then ? 
   they do n't encourage violence ever read leviticus ? 
  how can it not be ? 
  there 'd be land all around . 
  at this point i 'd be interested in a top 10 of cities that have never featured on any urban quality-of-life list . 
  nah , we just have terrible aim . 
  oh , there 's a winner alright . 
  it 's just not one of you two . 
  ca n't throw him out when he does n't show up in the first place ... 
  what else ? 
  on the other hand - if praying * does * work , then why are you the only superpower ? 
  scotland is trying to annex europe ? 
  i , for one , welcome our new scottish overlords . 
  on the other hand - those experts are * economists * . 
  nonsense . 
  people might have spoken different dialects , but dutch spelling was already fairly standardised by that time . 
  dutch from that period is actually very easy to read . 
  [ the sound of a lur , the ancient danish horn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld6dt-lce6m ), 
  technically the southernmost bit of gelderland around nijmegen and the bits of brabant and limburg just south of there do n't speak a brabantic dialect , but rather a [ kleverlands ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kleverlands ) / [ kleverl\u00e4ndisch ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kleverl%c3%a4ndisch ) dialect . 
  so crossing the border near kleve/kleef should theoretically make things easier , although the local dialects have been heavily influenced by their national languages . 
  even more fun fact : nsb : norwegian national railcompany and dutch nazi-party during wwii . 
  ns : dutch national railcompany and norwegian nazi-party during wwii . 
  or how in the world is dutch lexically closer to greek than english is ? 
  oh definitely . 
  in fact the very first longship on the tapestry is an english one . 
  but it * is * the exact same style of ship . 
  it 's actually surprising how little they changed in those centuries . 
   ( well technically one of the two dominant ) now i 'm wondering . 
  what 's the other one ? 
  carvel built ships arrived a couple of centuries later , i think . 
   ( no drakkar ) if by * drakkar * you mean * drakar * , then actually yes , william the conquerer did use those . 
  [ the ships depicted on the bayeux tapestry are very clearly viking-style longships . 
  ] ( http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/professions/education/viking-knowledge/the-longships/picture-sources/the-bayeux-tapestry/ ), 
  we probably see the germans as more orderly and bureaucratic . 
  but really you should ask your question at / r/thenetherlands and / r/de and see what you get back . 
  could be interesting . 
  * and this is not the case with the dutch people ( gr\u00fcndlichkeit ) ? 
  * not when it comes down to wikipedia entries . 
  but to be fair , there are far fewer dutchmen than germans , so the germans have a numerical advantage when filling up their version of wikipedia . 
  there are some cultural differences between the dutch and germans . 
  those seem huge to us , but from your point of view we might as well be the same country , probably . 
  true for a lot of articles , but do n't underestimate the deutsche gr\u00fcndlichkeit . 
  as soon as a german gets really interested in a certain subject , you can count on the german wiki page being the size of a novel . 
  it is in the netherlands . 
  article [ 435d ] ( http://wetten.overheid.nl/bwbr0001854/2017-01-01#boekderde_titeldeelii_artikel435 ) of the dutch penal code states pretty clearly that you 're not allowed to use the swiss flag for commercial purposes or in ways that could offend the swiss . 
  also , the southern half the netherlands is at least nominally catholic . 
  including outer space . 
  the tartan approach to drawing borders . 
  oh , do n't worry . 
  as long as you 're spending money and not burning half of it down , we 're happy to have you !, 
  ... and all along the eastern border . 
  they only visit the beaches in summer , but they 're here year-round . 
  only if the netherlands can into nordic : [ milk consumption per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_milk_consumption_per_capita ), 
  the good news is , we finally managed to resolve that situation . 
  the bad news is , it 's not by winning a world cup ... 
  who 's going to design all the flags ? 
  they probably looked relatively nice when they were build . 
  new concrete in sunshine is bright and clean . 
  the materials used just do n't age very well . 
  the dirty grayness of weathered old concrete on a rainy day could leave anyone depressed . 
  obviuslie , but furst let us improev thet horriblie inkonsistent spelling of zers . 
   well yes two people in the same country share a culture , what 's that supposed to prove ? 
  if it was about geography , we could simply draw two lines on the map and go `` there 's north/south/east / west '' and be done with it . 
  but the whole point of this map is to divide europe into similar cultures and shared histories . 
  i 'm not trying to diss the north or scotland or anything . 
  glasgow was by far the most fun city i 've ever lived in - despite it 's reputation . 
  there 's just nothing nordic about glasgow or newcastle . 
  culturally , they 're very much western europe . 
  shetland or the orkneys on the other hand ... 
  sure . 
  now compare a glaswegian to a swede and an englishmen . 
  problem is , the bits inbetween are the bits we live on . 
  unless you 're proposing we all should live in tree houses . 
  there 's a strong north/south divide in belgium as well . 
  that does n't make flanders scandinavian . 
  by making fun of the chinese , apparently . 
  or bikes . 
  streets . 
  * every * decent-sized town in the netherlands has a street named after him . 
  it 's hard to sound drunk when you do n't talk . 
  the answer is right there at the top, 
  i 'm assuming he 's impressed by the fact that a brit can distinguish between * das * and * dass * .
