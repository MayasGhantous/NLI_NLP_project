  maybe that is why it passed , nobody wanted to talk or read about it so they did n't know what was in the bill they passed, 
   which limits the number of digits that can be inserted into an orifice for sexual stimulation . 
  this is a gold mine for firework victims good for britain to create jobs for the disabled, 
   again with door example , this is like saying `` if you pass this door , we might allow you enter ( we will have a vote , and all of our club members must vote in favor of you , not even one against ) . '', 
  while two of the club members are actively blocking door . 
  what can turkey do at that point , destroy the door ? 
  if you are just going to ignore that turkey blocked cyprus planes , this discussion will go nowhere . 
  it is at least one of the hurdles turkey can unilaterally remove ( which is a political move , which just moments ago you were complaining about ) i see nothing wrong for the eu or individual eu members to demand a order in the requirements , if turkey lifted the ban on cypress planes , and the corresponding countries afterwards do not lift the halt to the chapters they blocked for that reason , i would be on your side . 
  but turkey willingly blocks a eu members flights , of course we as the eu take such a thing seriously . 
  turkey not willing signals to me the same thing ; they want cypress solved before joining  i meant in the current situation if cyprus was united and tried to do shitty things to turks there , eu would react after everything happened . 
  you base this on ? 
   the difference is they still wan na do it and even promise to do it . 
  people tend to dislike getting invaded , losing their home and stuff  also : that most troubling problem can be solved with eu itself though . 
  if there was no borders and eez/economic agreements with cyprus/turkey , and a guarantee for turkish local representation in cyprus ( with eu rules ) , why would turkey intervene ? 
  that is not the problem , once turkey is in the eu it has a lot of political power protecting an eu member from another eu member is way harder than protecting an eu member from a non-eu member turkey will be the second biggest country in the eu , cypress one of the smallest . 
  together with the the geographical location turkey will wield way more political power in the talks than they should, 
   its not turkish rules , its a `` reminder '' from turkey . 
  just before that , you will notice this sentence : `` it is a commitment of the eu to carry out the negotiations on chapters only on the basis of the relevant acquis . '', 
  where in that link does it say anything about not allowing politics interfering ? 
  the whole process involves politics , it does n't make sense it can not interfere . 
   what ? 
  wheer does it say that ? 
  `` turkey 's rejection to open its ports and airports to traffic from cyprus in 2006 '' https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5eg5t4/erdogan_says_eu_lawmakers_vote_on_turkish/dacf2b1/  and the speed of eu 's reaction why should we have reacted ? 
  it was foreign politics , they did n't join the eu until 2004  they moved to island in the 80-90s , they lived majority of their lives in cyprus etc , but they want to `` remove '' them . 
  just like the turks did after the invasion , and the greek part did shit hit the fan at the invasion . 
  all the more reason to have this settled before turkey joins, 
   ** turkey emphasizes ** that the technical negotiation process should not be slowed down for political reasons . 
  if it is turkey that made this rule , i care little for it secondly , it is turkey that refused the airline ** for political reasons **  if i close the door before you enter , would that make you `` failed to enter '' or `` blocked to enter '' ? 
  your own quote said ; `` turkey refused '' and the eu responded to that . 
   we already know what happens if that is arciheved from crete or mainland greece or cyprus itself . 
  are you fucking joking me ? 
  you say the eu will allow ethic cleansing or genocide because it happened 100 years ago somewhere else in that case we ca n't let the turks have after what happened to the armenians or the ethnic cleansing on cyprus itself, 
  i do n't see the problem , what prevents turkey from dealing with know requirements like cyprus ? 
   turkey 's rejection turkey failed the requirement , why should we continue talks if they are not willing to fulfill one sided requirements ? 
  i see nothing wrong with stopping chapters if there seems no solution on the horizon for the most troubling problem, 
  if not for erdogan ultimatum it would have been all the more drama ; eu kicking ` poor ' turkey out . 
  this ultimatum he gave us is great . 
  i 'm not following you , what are they vetoing ? 
  that is pretty much the same thing as keeping it open, 
  maybe we were overly optimistic when we gave those requirements but i do n't see that a breach of good faith . 
  turkey knew full well that it is n't a guarantee it is irrelevant now anyway as turkey does n't seem interested in fulfilling the requirements anymore, 
   not in the current political climate . 
  yeah , but we will not be in the current political climate by the time they would fulfill all requirements . 
  it would require time and a different political course for that to happen, 
  they would be fully in their right to demand a yes/no from us at that point, 
  fulfilled requirements would already mean a changed turkey , so why not leave the possibility open it will be enough change for even austria czechia and poland, 
  of course we are saying maybe to him ; we gave them a list of requirements , until that is fulfilled that stays a maybe, 
  edogan ; we demand an answer now eu ; no edogan ; you are not allowed to say no, 
  because erdogan demanded an answer a few weeks ago , then he can have his answer ; no, 
  far in the future i hope , but currently we are politically too different america is too war-hungry , their gun policy and rooted problems with the black communities . 
  muslim countries have too little liberties , are too sectarian , too religious . 
   i do n't want my country to become a glorified province what is wrong with gelderland ? 
  noord holland ? 
  you already live in a glorified province and it did n't seem a problem before, 
  i 'm not saying you should n't have national identity , i have to , but most political issues are similar in europe . 
  zwarte piet is a bad example , as it is n't a political issue , it is a cultural one , you ca n't ban witte piet , and you ca n't ban zwarte piet . 
  it has nothing to do with den haag or brussel . 
  i know the average person does n't identify like that , that is why included that sentence , i wanted people the argue the difference , our issues are not that different, 
  i just ca n't understand the dutch eu hate . 
  what does the netherlands have that other countries ca n't have ? 
  how do we compete in the future ? 
  we are a knowledge economy , the thing about knowledge is that it is n't limited and it is n't limited within borders , in fact we actively try to educate less fortunate countries . 
  time is ticking , our knowledge advantage is n't going to last forever , we need friends and allies to stabilize , we need to be part of a bigger whole there is one thing more we have , it is river estuaries , but belgium , france and germany are not going accept insane taxes we 'll put on their traffic who cares about dutch identity , how is european identity that much different ? 
  whether rules come from den haag or brussels i hardly see the difference . 
  our army is to small to hold much enemy ground anyway and it seems unlikely on the short term that we will need to defend our own ( or are you brits planning something ? ), 
  `` if you want your answer that badly now : ' * no , you do n't fulfill the requirements we gave you , you already know that , you 're just trying to blame the eu for you not wanting to fulfill the requirements * ' '', 
  you do n't renew all bureaucrats every election , these are fixed positions . 
  you do n't want to lose all that experience . 
  and they are to be country neutral if i understand this guy . 
  so as long they keep working in the interest for the eu and do n't deal with secret stuff i see no problem new hires of course should be chosen from eu countries, 
  they can deal and debate over these subjects when the uk pushes the article 50 button no use solving problems that do n't exist, 
  with our relatively small army ships are way more useful than tanks besides we have obligations towards nato to keep spending on defence, 
  what is the alternative to crimea not being russian ? 
  what set of circumstances ( excluding war ) is going to put crimea out of russian control ? 
  go to war or accept it is russian , i do n't see a 3rd option, 
  how did the netherlands fail ? 
  they registered a company breaking the rules and took all the eggs related out of the market . 
  an apparently notified export countries the article is n't clear , but if belgium registered that products did n't conform to standards , was a health risk and did nothing , then belgium failed . 
  actually the opposite , all bad eggs are destroyed less egg on the market , equal demand , means higher prices . 
   kidnap a random child , then demand ransom in bitcoin and if paid set it free somwhere . 
  or else kill it ? 
  if you want to have a huge team of specialists looking for you this is the way to do it . 
  it sounds extremely risky, 
  so i was right in not trusting it , they artificially inflated the civilian casualties and conflated terms . 
  plain bad journalism, 
   between july 2015 and december 2016 , more than 2,000 were killed , including 1,200 civilians and 800 members of turkish security forces im not trusting this source , the numbers do n't add up ... where are the pkk killed ? 
  are they ` civilians ' ? 
  why are the numbers different ? 
  see my other comment for my general reply, 
  seems to be about turkey , the last decades . 
  do you have something that points specifically to erdogan . 
  i doubt anyone disagrees it is a fucked up war over there last few decades . 
  but pointed the finger specifically to erdogan, 
  why did n't you link the source of where you copied that from ? 
  sure ... it is just like the 4th of july when the usa sends all its ministers abroad to celebrate freedom or like the 5 of may when the dutch send all their ministers abroad to celebrate their freedom wait ... nobody does that . 
  nobody sends all their political leaders abroad when celebrating national holidays . 
  if you think this is n't about politics you are deluded, 
  given erdogan power graps before the coup it would not surprise me the army would intervene before they lost the ability to . 
  what we both probably agree on is that the gulen purge was planned . 
  to many people were arrested to quickly for it not to be prepared for weeks or even months .
