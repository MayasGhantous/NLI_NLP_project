  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures  you are an incredibly ignorant uneducated person . 
  the us is the # 2 manufacturing nation in the world and defense contractors make up a very small part of the gdp . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_united_states there is no excuse for you to not know these things . 
  learn first , speak second . 
  i 'll see you in a few years when you 've caught up . 
  okay sweety , i admit i used a bit of a snide hyperbole , but that does n't excuse you downplaying it .

   this coming from a european ? 
  do you have any self awareness ? 
  and you did say that . 
  oh stop crying . 
  every time you guys wan na critisize europe you talk about your military spending and hiw you are saving our ass every day and are the ones keeping nato alive . 
  if that 's not self-fellatio , i do n't know what is . 
   so clearly the us lost both wars and the taliban and saddam remained in power . 
  not saying you lost it , but you ca n't exactly call it a win either . 
  and yeah , the taliban is pretty much still in power . 
  and would you say that without saddam iraq is better ? 
  i mean , isis is a direct result of this . 
   especially given that you think this ally provides you with no security benefit . 
  never said that . 
  you can twist my words all you want if you think it makes your point . 
  my point was that `` we spend so much money on our military '' is not our fault . 
  shit , weapons and millitary equipment are the few things you still produce yourself , your economy relies in it . 
  how is that europe 's fault ? 
  my point was also to show you that the higher spending meant very little in the last couple wars . 
  did n't say that . 
  just wish you guys wouldnt suck your own dick as much and claim that the amount you spend has made your and our lives easier . 
  clearly it does n't , because you guys keep complaining how much you spend . 
  it was always called a war though . 
  and i thought were there because of the war on terror and weapons of mass destruction . 
  also your first point is a bit nonsensical . 
  i didnt talk about ` welfare ' ( which is a delightfully vague term . 
  could mean a lot of things ) , but surely you realise that you spend three times as much as the number two ( china ) . 
  and it 's not helping much . 
  hey , do n't blame the rest of the world when you 're drowning in your own military industrial complex . 
  and is all that spending really helping ? 
  because a bunch of untrained rebels with weapons that were old last century gave you a run for your money in both of your last wars . 
   and , yes i am ready to do this except you would n't have to do it so it 's easy to talk tough . 
  and in the end all they have to do is sink their boat ( as already happens ) and your plan becomes unrealistic . 
  i think mr. bremer is mixing up his statuses . 
  what he is talking about are asylum seekers in general . 
  refugees are a status you ( maybe ) get after you sought asylum in a country . 
  it 's all clearly defined . 
  i give mr. bremer tue benefit of the doubt and say maybe something went lost in translation , but he is in clear contridiction when he says the overwhelming number are refugees and later on says  they have various legal statuses , including illegal entry , asylum-seekers and asylum applicants refugee is a clearly defined status . 
   refugee , according to the geneva convention on refugees [ 1 ] [ 2 ] is a person who is outside their country of citizenship because they have well-founded grounds for fear of persecution because of their race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , and is unable to obtain sanctuary from their home country or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country ;[ how do people from morocco and algeria fit this description ? 
  ( they do n't ) . 
  which are n't refugees , what everyone is talking about . 
  people from algeria or morocco are n't refugees by definition . 
   a person who has been forced to leave their country in order to escape war , persecution , or natural disaster . 
  so how exactly are the facts i present wrong ? 
  yet the conversation here is how `` refugees '' are all to blame for it . 
  how exactly are they to blame for it ? 
  or is refugee just an euphemism for foreigner ? 
  if the asylumseekers were behind the arson that is . 
  could be , but there is no evidence either way . 
  still has nothing to do with what i said . 
  maybe you should reply to him and not to me ? 
  what has this to do with what i said ? 
  we 're talking about cologne and you bring up france . 
  that is another discussion alltogether , do n't you think ? 
  the article does say they have no idea who has done this , so by calling asylumseekers `` animals '' while blaming them on this vandalism shows your true colours . 
  fact is , people here talk about refugees being responsible for cologne , except there is very little evidence to support that . 
  so go ahead , show me how i am wrong jn this assertion instead of downvoting me or posting strawman arguments . 
  daily reminder . 
  only three out if 58 men arrested were in fact refugees . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/cologne-only-three-out-of-58-men-arrested-in-connection-with-mass-sex-attack-on-new-years-eve-are-a6874201.html but sure , let 's talk about ~ ~ rampart ~ ~ refugees . 
  only three of the 58 people arrested were refugees . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/cologne-only-three-out-of-58-men-arrested-in-connection-with-mass-sex-attack-on-new-years-eve-are-a6874201.html but sure , keep blaming it on refugees . 
  who needs facts anyway ? 
  edit : < downvotes to the left , who cares about facts in an important discussion anyway ? 
  looks like you are reading way more in what people write than what they are actually saying . 
  what political agenda ? 
  and where does op say that afghanistan was like the west ? 
  no , he did not . 
  all he claims that there was slow advancement towards a more secular state , to a more modern state . 
  but the poster are n't disagreeing with the idea that afghanistan was peaceful in that time . 
  on the contrary . 
  honesty by telling falsehoods , that 's new . 
  it helps if you include a link or at least some reasoning , instead of just saying `` nuh-uh '' . 
  yeah , how dare they ?!, 
  pretty sure the usa has copyright on that . 
   but i 'd rather change the crop industry through laws and regulations yeah , pretty sure trump would support his . 
  lol . 
  but he is a socialist !!!, 
  yes , but you are talking about a total take over . 
  if it is that apparant , you should have no problem providing me data on this trend . 
  but if you did you would have to admit that the muslim birth rate in europe is 2.1 vs 1.5 non-muslim europeans , which is n't as scary . 
  or that the global muslim birth rate is 3.1 vs the global christian 2.7 . 
  funny how you make these serious claims but have nothing to back it up .

  give me an empirical source that confirms what you 're saying . 
  smells like bullshit . 
  second and third generation immigrants usually fall in line with natives when it comes to reproduction rates . 
  you mean the values from a time where most criminals would get away with their crime ? 
  sounds terrific , if you have no grasp on the historical context when you say these platitudes . 
  could you really blame the values and on what basis ? 
  how long did it take to find a three year old post ? 
  not really sure what your point is . 
  no , you 're right . 
  they can report you and you 'll be fined instead .
