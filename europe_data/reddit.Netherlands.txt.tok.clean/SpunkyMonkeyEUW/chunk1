i remember there was a time in eurovision when it did n't matter what you were and it only mattered if you made good music . 
  oh who am i kidding the whole thing is corrupt and a fucking joke . 
  i guess reading comprehension is n't a strength of yours . 
  i dare you to read ttip . 
  america 's control goes a lot further than you are aware of . 
  the rich are getting a whole lot richer and the poor and only get tiny amounts of increased income . 
  the cost of living is also increasing so the poor are kicked even further down the well . 
  in general , it varies from country to country but the usa is a great example of this and a few european countries as well . 
  while we like to think we are better than the usa , corporations still play a huge role in policy making . 
  i would agree that varoufakis is exaggerating but i can understand the sentiment . 
  there is certainly a trend in corporations making more money and policies being made to benefit them . 
  i do n't believe in these kinds of coincidences when almost every major corporation are getting caught doing dirty practices . 
  ** but most of them are **, 
  welcome to / r/europe where some asshats refuse to create a constructive dialogue on the cultural problems of islam . 
  many people refuse to acknowledge that some of the teachings are borderline barbaric and argue that it 's just individuals that have problems and nothing to do with the religion . 
  if christianity can move out of the middle ages then why ca n't islam ? 
  while i 'm completely against this type of protesting , i 'm going to be really pissed if the bbc provides coverage on this story and makes a point out of it . 
  the bbc have made it quite clear that they are content with creating their own agenda with the migrant crisis and have been very selective in choosing which stories to cover ( they mostly favour portraying the migrants in a positive light when many of their actions say other wise ) . 
  i 'm getting really concerned with the media warfare that is going on with this serious issue . 
  as much as i respect them for going against this stupid quota , there is honestly not much they can do . 
  they had a type of legal agreement and they ca n't back down even though the numbers are ridiculously huge . 
  already 20 comments from people who did n't read the article . 
  the title is based on a quote that was taken out of context and it 's making some juicy one liner comments . 
  just a reminder , a ** majority ** of the migrants are n't even syrian . 
  the migrants refuse to get identified , they refuse to respect the border laws , they throw rocks at police forces , they throw away free food and water and reject temporary shelter from countries that are n't the chosen one . 
  on top of that , they get outraged at free asylum in eastern european countries because they have higher standards . 
  this is the price we have to pay for merkel 's path of righteousness . 
  just admit you are wrong merkel , save face and come up with a pragmatic solution that is n't tied to the emotional arguement . 
  the pm actually had a good solution that saves us billions of euros and a lot of grief with integrating people that have no interest in accepting our values :  sobotka said the eu needed to focus on trying to find a solution to the war in syria ; helping in countries neighboring the crisis areas ; protecting external borders ; creating centers for asylum-seekers at eu borders and turning back economic migrants . 
   sobotka said the eu needed to focus on trying to find a solution to the war in syria ; helping in countries neighboring the crisis areas ; protecting external borders ; creating centers for asylum-seekers at eu borders and turning back economic migrants . 
  why is this not common sense ? 
  this saves the eu billions of euros , it saves us from havig to deport people that will not integrate and it will prevent a lot of potential criminality that will come with uneducated and unidentifiable migrants . 
  we are not obligated to take these people in and i do n't want to share my society with people who spit on our values before they even get asylum . 
   we should not judge a whole group by the actions of a few asshats . 
  you are being really intolerant and you generalize . 
  most of the migrants are really nice people who have had a super hard time and just want to be safe and have a real life again . 
  you literally call me out for generalizing and do the exact same thing in your last sentence . 
  you are correct . 
  a lot of tension in the middle east comes from the fact that there are many tribe-like factions within a country and one of them has absolute power . 
  they are not united under a national identity and many of them resent each other . 
  it can become a nasty cycle of power shifting or one group keeping absolute power while the rest are undermined/oppressed . 
  article is gone . 
  is there a cached version somewhere ? 
   do you think that if you put 5500 western european men in a single building , coming from war and from poverty , together with 500 women , for months on end without any assurances as to their ultimate fate , that there would be no rape and violence ? 
  you rationalize rape that actually happened to women because of a hypothetical situation that you made up . 
  look up the rape statistics in sweden and i 'll give you a spoiler , muslim immigrants are a ** minority ** in the country and commit a ** majority ** of rapes in sweden . 
  i will say it again , a lot of these immigrants will never be able to integrate because they do n't want to accept our values . 
  women 's rights being abysmal in the middle east is a cultural problem and it gets ingrained into a lot of men and not all of them will give up those thoughts because they are in a new continent . 
   `` well shit , we should probably set something up for those women , and we should split asylum centers into smaller , more manageable units , and perhaps we should have tolerance classes and other activities so the asylum seekers can start the integration process while they 're waiting , instead of being subjected to the torture of idleness . '', 
  i always enjoy practical solutions to the problem but think about it . 
  let 's assume they segregated women from and the amount of rapes decrease , what happens when these men get residency and are in a shared society with women and men . 
  what stops them from raping them after they are out of the asylum centre ? 
  again , these people are incompatible and should not be allowed here in the first place after refusing to get identified by authorities . 
  there is a systemic problem in how women are portrayed in islam and an asylum getting segregated is not going to solve this cultural issue where women are inferior to men . 
   how is a `` commit one crime and you are out policy '' going to help the situation ? 
  those refugees will be back next year , or even next week . 
  how does kicking them out teach them our values ? 
  how does it even fit in to our values in the first place ? 
  if they get registered and have finger prints taken they will never be allowed back in the eu as long as they are alive . 
  you can call me hateful and bigoted but at the end of the day , i value my secular values and i appreciate that women can walk down the street dressed in any way they like with out fear of getting raped or attacked because of a book written nearly 2000 years ago . 
  thanks a lot for the laugh . 
  i think that you might want to look into tolerance being used in different contexts . 
  if i said that they should instate a `` commit one crime and you are out policy '' , would you have still wasted your time with such a silly comment ? 
  i have a story which my dad told me back when he worked in qatar ( he works for an oil company ) . 
  while the city of doha is quite pretty in terms of architecture and cleanliness , there 's very little for you to do as an expat other than going to the shopping mall ( a past time for wealthy qataris is blowing your money on expensive cars ) . 
  he was there on a saturday which happens to be the only day that the nepali/indian migrants get a day off from their 60 + hour work weeks . 
  he saw a small group of migrants getting rejected from entering the mall by security because they are simply not allowed to . 
  they security racially profile the migrants and do n't let them in to keep the prestige of the mall intact . 
  my dad goes to the security guard and says that they are with him and the guard lets them in . 
  the migrants were so happy that they were allowed in to go shopping and something just as simple as my dad treating them as an equal human being made their whole week . 
  these migrants die by the thousands to build their empty metropolis and they are n't even allowed to use their one day off to go to the carrefour in the mall because they want to keep the prestige intact . 
  on top of that , they barely scrape 300 dollars a month for 60 + hours per week of work and they get thrown by the dozens in tiny shitty apartments . 
  utterly disgusting society . 
  i wonder how long it will take for people to take their heads out of their ass and understand that there are people that do n't share our liberal and tolerant mindset . 
  many of these migrants are simply incompatible with western europe and you ca n't force these people that have been taught for decades that women are worth as much as your dog to all of a sudden change and treat the opposite sex as equal . 
  what it should come down to is a 0 tolerance policy . 
  you commit one crime ( especially as heinous as rape ) and you are fucking out . 
  no questions asked , no second chances , you are deported back to your shitty backwards society and you can rot there . 
  you base this sub being right-winged because a lot of people oppose the mass migration of unidentifiable muslims ? 
  yeah the ones that ca n't get rifles go around hacking people with machetes or axes . 
  can i have some of whatever it is you are smoking ? 
  it 's mind boggling that those fuckers have n't even gotten asylum yet and they are already breaking the law and spitting on our values . 
  think of the women and children !, 
  oh wait there are hardly any of those . 
  jesus are you a bit slow ? 
  they are migrants looking for works/benefits . 
  keep sticking your head in the sand if you truly believe that none of the welfare states have their own issues with poverty . 
  selling everything you currently own as an average syrian is dwarfed by the benefits and shelter they get over their life time . 
  the thing is , taking in refugees when your country is n't doing well is social suicide . 
  even though the economic situation is improving , there are still plenty of unemployed citizens and people living in extreme poverty in wealthy european nations . 
  to put a bunch of migrants before your own people is just a massive fuck you when they come in demand for a better living standard than your native poor and refuse to integrate into their host society . 
  do you have a source on that ? 
  i do n't necessarily doubt you but that would be very terrible if it 's true . 
  how the fuck did that guy pass as a 17 year old ? 
  i think you should watch the south park episode on hate crimes so you can understand how silly your logic is . 
  i read his comments and there was 0 reference to race of the murderer but somehow you extrapolate that his comment has racial tension . 
  he said called `` them '' scum and them was referring to senseless murderers . 
  do n't be `` that guy '' that undermines an argument by going into pointless semantics . 
  i bet you only have dull knives at home because you take all of the edge out of them . 
  hahahahaha .
