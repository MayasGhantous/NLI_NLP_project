  mate , please do n't make it that ridiculously obvious that you did n't read the article . 
  this guy has been in germany for over a decade and has ** nothing ** to do with the migrant/refugee crisis . 
  you ca n't go around making gross assumptions like that mister sherlock holmes . 
  he 's entitled to hate murders of any race and is not racist if the murderer happens to have a different race . 
  at this point , i really hope you just get a comment ban for such poor behaviour . 
  more of `` hey i 'll piggy back off the syrian war , throw away any form of id and claim to be syrian for them dank benefits and standard of living '' . 
  well that just go dark real fast . 
  from a lot of the stats i have been seeing lately , a ** majority ** of the `` refugees '' are working age men travelling on their own and not even half of them are syrians . 
  probably a `` syrian '' refugee as you can hear from his reasonable demands . 
   f they were doing it out of rage because they felt they were mistreated , with religion playing no part in their motivation , then it is not religious violence . 
  yeah . 
  hungarian police abused the shit out of those poor refugees by giving them water , food and shelter !, 
  fuck them !, 
  i ca n't believe that the hungarian authorities had the audacity to try to id them !, 
  just a reminder of what you are doing . 
  you are defending a man who took his kid and wife hostage . 
  there is 0 fucking excuse for what that disgusting man did . 
  watch out or someone might use the dreaded r word because you do n't use your emotions to argue a serious case . 
  yup . 
  there 's a place in denmark called thisted and you pronounce it `` tiestel '' if you are dutch or `` teestul '' if you are english . 
  really weird language ( coming from the dutch man ) . 
  you say that it 's not hard of done properly but you have a very unrealistic solution to begin with . 
  joining is is just an invitation to get hit by an airstrike . 
  that 's their list of reform proposals , 
  a `` rational scientist '' would legalize gay marriage because it 's fucking retarded to discriminate against people for liking the same sex . 
  you get certain benefits/rights for being married and you are denying that to people because they are homsexual . 
   belgium , in fact , tried to do this way before switzerland , we crushed them , twice . 
  yeah i 'm sure you can tell me all about your conquests in war from your cosy office chair . 
  i 'm sure that what your ancestors did is just as much your achievement as it was theirs . 
  the definition is so vague which is why politicians and media abuse it . 
  terrorism has lost it 's meaning which is why i stopped using it . 
  the general american population has no idea of the attrocities commited by the us army in vietnam . 
  hell most do n't even know that the cia has been responsible for coups in central america and getting a cruel dictator in power in iran . 
  only america 's glory in war is taught . 
  i think the data would be more interesting if they seperated the usa with each individual state rather than looking at the country as a whole . 
  considering what she did she should be happy that she is living a few hundred years after the guillotine stopped getting used . 
  i think they were more open to nato securing it rather than the dutch army . 
  i do n't think you should let it grind your gears . 
  they can treat this like a game all they want but their country is at the virge of imploding so we get the last laugh . 
  i will feel very sorry for the millions of people deeply affected by something they have no control over but at the same time i am sick of these greek clowns with power treating this like a joke . 
  their only abysmal strategy has been trying to get meaningless edges over the germans for negotiations when they should be begging to stay in the eu and not let their whole nation turn to shit . 
  i think they peaked while talking about how to ( not ) pay back their debts . 
  no need to berate him for being a martyr with karma as his stakes . 
  dude 's hardcore . 
  exactly . 
  my idea for dealing with the immigrants was having national referendum 's in countries that are mostly affected by the crisis . 
  the people more than anything deserve the most say because i can assure you that no affluent official is going to want an asylum centre in their neighbourhood . 
  it 's pretty insane as well that they are putting them near wealthy neighbourhoods where home values are going to plummet . 
  is any one going to want to live in this german village ? 
  no way in hell which means that these people will never be able to move out on an economic level unless they win the lottery . 
   `` god !, 
  open debate ? 
  over the last ten years this has been one of the main topics for discussion in sweden . 
  it surprises me that a man like knausg\u00e5rd , who has lived in sweden , is also a victim of this delusion . '' a discussion is a 2 way conversation and the dialogue seems to be only towards immigration because opposing it is stigmatized . 
  i hardly believe that the other side of the argument is being discussed because it has come to a point where you have thousands of refugees/migrants that are going to be living outside in tents while a brutal nordic winter is on their doorstep . 
  all while they are ** still ** accepting more refugees when they do n't have proper accommodation . 
  ok i feel like a broken record with these comments . 
  a life sentence in scandinavian countries and many western european countries can get renewed based on psychological assessment . 
  if they still deem him a threat to society , he will have his sentence renewed ( i hope he gets his ass deported after 13 years ) . 
  what he did was premedidated and ruthless towards a complete stranger so it 's looking grim . 
  anders got a life sentence of 20 something years but there 's no way in hell he will ever be released back into society . 
  it makes me sad how much that waste of skin is going to cost the swedish tax payers . 
  hopefully they 're building a massive file on wealthy people and bringing them to justice . 
  i think it 's great thst this policy will improve the future but the current scale of tax evasion is proposterous . 
  not that i am addicted to it , but i seriously could not imagine my life with 0 porn consumption . 
  do those `` anti porn campaigners '' even relieve themselves or do they just look at their genitals in disgust ? 
  how pathetic is your existence that you make it a life mission to stop the consumption of porn . 
  these sexually repressed people need therapy , not an opinion . 
  that made me say `` what the fuck '' . 
  it 's mindblowing that you have a protocol that allows disgusting behaviour to delay your procedure . 
  the problem with that solution is that it makes too much sense . 
  got ta cater to the emotional argument so you do n't get called a racist . 
  i just really do n't understand the logic that many muslims have from countries that practice islamic-related law . 
  if i go to countries like uae , qatar and saudi arabia i better conform to their practices or i get thrown in jail or potentially killed ( in saudi arabia ) . 
  having a non-conforming opinion of islam in countries like those can even be dangerous . 
  i ca n't pretend to be offended because it will never work . 
  yet when they come over here , we must conform to ** their ** standards . 
  sadly , there is nothing we can do about them . 
  we have a lot of 2 ^ nd / 3 ^ rd generation moroccan 's and turks that we ca n't do anything about because they are citizens . 
  sadly , the only solution is to modernize islam but i do n't see that happening with muslims who live in the west yet want the worst barbaric practices . 
   el-khatib slammed the committee 's ruling and accused denmark of engaging in `` thought control of the worst kind '' . 
  holy shit this guy is fucked in the head . 
  islam is the exact embodiment of what he is calling out the danish for . 
  it 's a pretty ruthless and controlling religion where death is the punishment for leaving islam . 
  every time non-religious people scrutinize the religion we get the same old `` you are racist '' defence . 
  hell , i would get killed in saudi arabia and iran for the the shit i just said . 
  he did nazi that coming . 
  i do n't think that the point of the cartoon was to specifically say that germany is arming iraq/syria . 
  just that they export a shit ton of weapons . 
  instead of exporting democracy to the usa we will give you real mayonnaise . 
  we were never supposed to know how it feels damn it !, 
  tax payer dollars fund the companies producing them , 
  with a little effort in america , you go to your dad 's gun vault and steal one to go shoot up a school . 
  it 's a bit naive to think that guns do n't exacerbate the problem . 
  which is a lot easier with guns . 
  i do n't think you understand how business works . 
  this is not a `` do or die '' move . 
  they are not forced to take the deal to stay afloat . 
  europe is focused a lot more on `` brand awareness '' than the american market and companies that partake in scummy business practices make less potential profit . 
  they have plenty of time to find another partner or someone to sell their product .
