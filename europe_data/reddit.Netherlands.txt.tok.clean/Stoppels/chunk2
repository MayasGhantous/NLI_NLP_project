  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/tweede_kamerverkiezingen_1977-2012.png ) source : dutch version of [ this wiki-page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historic_composition_of_the_house_of_representatives_of_the_netherlands ) . 
  finally , the mainstream media did not cover [ this ] ( http://laatzenietlopen.blogspot.nl/2015/12/persbericht-demonstratie-extreem.html ) at all , but a close friend of mine was one of nearly 40 people who were arrested `` because they look leftist '' last month . 
  i am not bullshitting you , it 's really as ridiculous as it sounds . 
  my friend was chatting with a friendly policeman about what he and the others were going to do ( counter-demonstrate , basically show the dozens of journalists that the extreme right attracts that there 's a counter voice to racist pigs ) who apologized that he had to arrest my friend because he had just received orders to round up everybody who looked like they could be leftist . 
  why ? 
  because leftist people were going to hold a counter-demonstration against the extremist right fucks who were holding demonstrations themselves . 
  and none of these people were [ antifa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-fascism ) as far as i know . 
  leftist country my ass . 
    always going after the right-wing bogeyman . 
  it seems like for 20 years now i 've been reading about how right-wing extremists are on the rise . 
  every year they 're on the horizon and ready to strike at a moment 's notice . 
  you might want to look up fascists and similar minded people . 
  such history is explicitly taught in europe , because the moment we start forgetting the horrors of the past is the moment we allow new horrors to come about . 
  it 's something we remind ourselves of every year when we remember those who fell in war or peacekeeping missions . 
  the misinformation / attitude you stated is part of the first phase . 
  but i ca n't blame you for that , it 's not a problem europe likes to address , possibly out of fear of giving them a stage . 
  you might want to lookup videos about neo nazi camps in [ europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=neo+nazi+camps+europe ) and [ russia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=neo%20nazi%20camps%20russia ) . 
  these are militarized extremists who are ready to kill anyone who they think should die , as you can hear them say in some videos . 
  the threat is very present , even if you personally do n't ( want to ) see it . 
  ninja : oi , this turned out a bit longer than i wanted to initially . 
  according to the police , that is not legally a threat . 
  that 's the problem though , these guys do n't take no for an answer , so whatever you do , you 're possibly doing it wrong . 
  regular mayors clearly often have n't undergone extra ( media ) training and that 's what they all probably need to do . 
  it 's expensive , nonetheless , it 's necessary in this political climate with such media . 
  the guy often acts as nothing more than a bully . 
  you need a certain lack of respect or a certain hunger for clicks and views and that 's exactly what his broadcasting organization is like . 
  they 're populistic and firmly right on the dutch political spectrum and generally like bullshitting around by being provocative and sometimes just disrespectful without reaching a goal ( garners views ) . 
  they are not considered real journalists , but they do n't consider themselves as ` traditional journalists ' either ( = a person who upholds journalistic principles , is somewhat politically correct and respectable ) . 
  i liked them and their fuck all attitude back when they were just the ` news blog ' geenstijl , because being politically incorrect was new and refreshing 13 years ago , but over the years i 've stopped taking them seriously . 
  notably , their increased influence has in turn increased the importance of being able to handle yourself during an interview ( especially when asked surprising or tough questions in general ) , particularly if you hold a public office or are otherwise a politician or someone who might be frequently in touch with the media . 
   this is infuriating and this should be punished . 
  the article makes it pretty clear that there 's this european dream in the third world , which is pretty much modeled after the classic `` american dream '' , and that moved them to move to here . 
  i 'm not sure how you would punish them for that , though . 
  would you lock them up in a jailhouse ? 
  would you send them back ? 
  they came here looking for opportunities and are now looking forward to going back . 
  what kind of punishment would actually be a punishment in this situation ? 
  a violent minority should never get their way . 
  and their violent behavior should especially not be propagated as self-defence . 
  generalize 1.6 billion people and nobody cares , generalize 700 million and ~ ~ everybody ~ ~ / r/europe loses their mind ... 
  [ so it was you !,

  good read , thanks for the link !, 
  that 's one country we do n't need to liberate . 
  look at that flag !, 
  you should drive through france , belgium and then through the netherlands . 
  if your roads are anything like france ( has tolls as well ) or belgium as opposed to our dutch roads , you wo n't want to go back home by car anymore . 
  interesting . 
  in the netherlands we used to have a system where it 's a gift if you earn a diploma within 10 years of starting your higher education ( you can take a relatively ` cheap ' loan with it ) . 
  nowadays , thanks to our center-right government and parties , it 's a 100 % loan and none of it is a gift . 
  okay , nice !, 
  is the grant a gift or is it only a gift if you receive a diploma within x years ? 
  how is it in france ? 
  french students still have to pay , right ? 
  ca n't her really good reason be that she does n't deem herself fit to rule ? 
  yes it 's ruling , she was basically * re * born into it as the heir of her name . 
  not much of a choice there . 
  i 've got a jar of ~ ~ dirt ~ ~ letters !, 
   no no one actually has any figures about who voted for what not age , social class or party preference but it has n't stopped people from making accusations . 
  i think you 've missed * every * news article , broadcast , video , blog or commentary about the elections . 
  did you know there is thing called a search machine that can find articles relevant to this subject ? 
  i know right , crazy !, 
  you better believe it . 
  only 15 % of the usual clients kept visiting coffeeshops , so up to 85 % went to the streets -- i imagine there were also many more people interested who would n't ordinarily go to a coffeeshop , but now could ask any random passer-by for a couple gram . 
  eindhoven was one of the eight municipalities that actually obeyed the national order to halt sale to foreigners , while the eleven others refused to enforce the weed pass requirement for coffeeshop visitors . 
  street trade flourished !, 
  it played a major role in killing off that same wietpas , together with the facts that it was unfair for the coffeeshops since their competitors in the eleven other municipalities were still operating as usual and that [ 85 % of * foreign * drug tourists ] ( http://www.ed.nl/regio/eindhoven/toerist-kan-weer-wiet-kopen-in-coffeeshops-eindhoven-1.5022881 ) went to those competitors instead . 
  the exact same population the national politicians who imposed this law wanted to keep out . 
  the political bullshit had some consequences . 
  obviously , street trade had a great bump and people undoubtedly bonded with their ~ ~ soul ~ ~ weedmates . 
  but [ hundreds of people ] ( http://www.bndestem.nl/regio/brabant/al-600-ontslagen-bij-coffeeshops-na-wietpas-1.897300 ) lost their jobs as a consequence . 
  and finally there may have been * some * success : drug tourists [ did n't know ] ( http://www.bndestem.nl/algemeen/binnenland/drugstoerist-dreigt-te-verdwalen-1.3599968 ) what to make of this nonsense and some of them probably stayed away ( 15 % ? 
  ) , taking their cash and non-drug tourism with them elsewhere . 
  * cycles to the coffeeshop , only to realize he 's too cheap to get anything else than street corner weed . 
  je tag , waar is je tag !, 
  harry !, 
  why not both ? 
  you know you should reconsider when your own logo is a sarcastic sneer . 
  yeah , definitely . 
  i just do n't know how long it would take to recover to the point they were at last month . 
  companies are fleeing or considering their options to flee to the mainland as we speak , countries ( e.g. 
  germany ) and individual cities are creating jobs aimed at helping these uk companies move in or expand ( e.g. 
  the same goes for expats , students and other young brits in the mainland . 
  for instance germany is preparing to offer them passports . 
  i do n't see those companies or people moving back anytime soon . 
   uk 's economy is super strong well , no . 
  it 's strong and was extremely stable before , but right now it 's almost as if it 's in a moderate free fall . 
  edit : almost as in that it is n't in free fall , most damage has been done , but it 's not stable yet and perception is very negative . 
  the # keeps falling . 
  he means the [ 2007 backstab ] ( http://langleveeuropa.nl/2015/06/jubileum-eu-regeert-al-10-jaar-zonder-mandaat/ ) in general . 
  ( note : skimmed the text , seems somewhat bitter but factual . ), 
  hahaha , everybody goes oh shit , germany 's power tripping and the dutch go `` yo momma '' . 
  because of acceptable results for cheap . 
  ah right , i figured you meant the time it takes to pray . 
  cool cool . 
  are you telling me you have 7 hours non-stop class ? 
  no breaks ? 
  nobody 's allowed to take leak or -- dare i say it -- leave ? 
  why is it that when we talk about muslims , we get hostile and start twisting the situation ? 
  seriously , you 're not convincing anyone by claiming not to have a break ever .
