  berlin is a couple of decades behind on the trend though . 
  it 's a very poor city that recently started to thrive . 
  it will see the same dynamics as vested cities like rotterdam or amsterdam where the middle/upper class either lives on the edge or in smaller rich cities just outside the big cities , where they have gardens , good schools , parking space and breathable air . 
  finland chose the f-18 for its ability to perform deep strikes ( in other words being able to strike back at russia ) if you have limited funds and have to take on a much larger foe you 're not going to maintain air superiority nor are you going to challange air superiority with jets . 
  you 're going to have a lot of ( mobile ) air defense , which is what finland does , the couple dozen of planes it has are to be used as deterrent . 
  ( in other words strike us , and we 'll strike st. petersburg , your industry , infrastructure etc. ), 
  this also makes the f-35 the best option as replacement . 
  big cities are increasingly for poor people to live in . 
  protesteren ? 
   nope . 
  due to having the most modern constuction industry in the world . 
  that 's why it 's being copied all over the world . 
  and i 'm santa claus . 
   the simplest and most common solution are ventilated fa\u00e7ades , which are anything but simple . 
  that 's very simple when you compare it them to other building standards . 
   how exactly are you able to make such an assertion if you do n't even know where those numbers were taken ? 
  because i know the costs , as there are widely available sources for that . 
   swiss voters rejected a 3.1 billion-franc ( $ 3.5 billion ) order for gripen fighter jets , a setback to swedish defense company saab ab . 
  the 22-plane contract , that 's the all-in * unit cost * for the gripen e , 3,5 billion/22 gripen e 's is ** 160 million dollar for one gripen e ** that is excluding operational costs ;  gripen opponents had argued that the planes would cost ** 10 billion francs ** over their lifetime , [ 1 ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-18/swiss-may-reject-3-5-billion-jet-purchase-srf-projections-show ) you 're free to go look for the others , examples enough . 
   maybe it 's better some dictator takes over because the way i look at it , the west is already a dictatorship , it just does n't have a single leader but a tight knit bunch of families running the deep governments . 
   well , we do have the most complex construction code in the world , due to bureaucracy no doubt . 
   but yeah , i imagine that at least foundation work in the netherlands has to be quite though at least . 
  the rest would be tougher as well due to the climate . 
  cold and moist require a whole different build up of walls , with glassfiber , pyrofoam , moisture barriers , cavity spaces , heated walls etc. 
  when you look at a home in the south they 're mostly just solid walls . 
   they are the unit costs , which represent the whole cost of equipping the nation with those systems ( including training , maintenance , infrastructure , etc ) divided by the number of units that are actually operated . 
  no they are n't , they 're bare unit costs you quoted . 
   meanwhile , the f-35 is repeatedly presented as a far more expensive option . 
  it has proven to be cheaper than the rafale and gripen when you factor in all costs . 
  in the south construction is much simpler . 
  we do have buildings with horizontal roofs ( flats , garage etc. 
  ) , but they 'll be layered with molten asphalt and the corners with lead ( pb ) slaps , or else the moisture will get through anything at some point . 
   horizontal roofs with about 5-10cm of layers of that stuff wo n't last 15 years and yes , who 's talking about horizontal roofs ? 
  normal homes are never build with horizontal roofs , that 's for an apartment building or garage , not a home . 
   `` of course , the key problem with any product made of cardboard is water . 
  to protect the house from the elements , the exterior is wrapped in a water-resistant , breathable foil . '', 
   so basically , you 'll be spending 30,000 $ every 5-10 years or so . 
  that 's why its placed above the ground . 
  much of the benefit of such a house are probably in its foundations , foundations are really a costly business in the netherlands , you need to ram a dozen of reinforced concrete pillars 10-20m into the ground ( depending on ground make-up ) if the house is light enough a shallower foundation might be sufficient . 
   it seems that the f-35 costs around 100m $ a pop . 
   the rafale costs about 70m $ . 
   the super hornet costs 60m $ . 
   the gripen costs between 30m $ and 60m $ . 
  these prices ( bare unit cost ) are misleading , because it 's all about the all-in price ( including weaponsystems , training , maintenance etc. ), 
  with all this included the prices are much closer to each other . 
   that , assuming that the f35 actually performs adequately as a fighter , better than all those mentioned . 
  it 's also the only plane with the ability for a deep penetration strike . 
  america has a tech industry , europe does not . 
  that 's very sad , but there 's a major potential for europe here . 
  america is turning into a repressive orwellian state , if europe moves the other way towards freedom , creativity and entrepeneurship it can create an environment where americans would rather start a company in europe , where americans would rather keep data in europe , where americans will prefer european laws and regulations . 
  if europe does not follow the us in this , it will be able to foster its own industry , because throughout history there has always been one major fact , freedom breeds creativity , innovation and productivity . 
  repression breeds only misery , nepotism and decay . 
  tisa will be sunk by the ep because it continues on a path of undermining eu institutions if it ever made it that far . 
  more likely it will sink before it even gets to a vote . 
  it 's because it 's inhabited by the french . 
  france is also very scarcely populated . 
   why do these people keep dreming up redicilous plans ? 
  obviously tony blair wants to speed up the brexit , hence his support for the brexit campaign . 
  demonizing all white people is not a ` wrong opinion ' , it is just disgusting behaviour . 
  she 's a member of a political party that wants to ban words from the dictionary , they want to make it illegal to call the armenia matter a genocide ( it must be called ` the armenian question ' ) turks never did genocide , it is impossible , because turks are not white . 
  they want the dutch parliament building to be converted into a museum for slavery , they want statues honouring all migrants in every municipality , they want total disarmement of the dutch armed force . 
  she 's insane . 
  and so incredibly stupid that on live tv she shared a photoshopped picture of donald trump which she was adament was true because ` she had seen the moving pictures ' . 
  the program later had to make a statement to its viewers that it was a photoshopped facebook image . 
  she has the brains of a toddler but is convinced she 's an intellectual . 
  she 's a walking meme factory , basically the kind of person that is so awkward without realizing it herself that you feel ashamed for her when she speaks and how she behaves . 
   they will beg to go back once they see the power of federal europe . 
  well hello there mr. fascist , that brown shirt is looking good on you . 
   we need a new treaty before asking people to vote . 
  but i 'm all for it . 
  why make two treaties ? 
  you want people to decide which way to go , make a treaty based on that decision . 
  it is not the governments duty to decide who governs us , that is ours . 
  it is their duty to govern us . 
  we the people decide who governs us . 
   what is more important , current contribution or expected gdp in the future ? 
  both are , but as rich and efficient they are , in the end they are just 15 millions people in a 550 millions union . 
  it 's 505 million , and 440 million people next year . 
  but i rather have 15 million people who contribute something to a cooperation than 300 million who only take from it . 
   at some point we 'll have to choose what do we want . 
  let 's have it then , organize referendums . 
   denmark + sweden = 3 % of the eu population , their loss would n't jeopardize the union . 
  i 'm sure it will be nice to have a remaining member count consisting of poor post-soviet corrupt states that contribute nothing . 
  denmark and sweden are more important than half the eu together . 
   but sure , not having euro is `` special treatment '' . 
  you 're obligated to adopt the euro , but do not do so . 
  that 's special treatment yes . 
  denmark has an opt-out on the euro , special treatment too . 
  i 'm not saying you should adopt the euro ( no sane developed country would ) just saying that not all countries are as retarded as the netherlands that they 'll work towards their own demise for others ' benefit . 
  in other words , neither sweden nor denmark would accept the straightjacket he/she 's proposing . 
   and stop giving special favours to individual countries . 
  that just undermines the eu . 
  be sure to relay that to denmark and sweden so they can make exit preparations . 
  ` only we should be able to use our media , you should merely be demonised by it . 
  stop using our tactics against ourselves . ', 
  a. merkel, 
  once there was a time when such threats from despotic regimes would have been answered in kind . 
  now we know this works , and angela will be on her knees before he finishes his sentence . 
   if we had only spent that time actually enacting changes to secure our borders have n't you heard , we ca n't secure our borders according to the cosmopolitan church . 
  not turmoil , these are not my words , but you understand quite well that all these little things nag at the stability and trust , and many little things can make a big problem .
