  hahahaha . 
   the only british waters in the zone are inside the port of gibraltar , nowhere else . 
  sorry but that 's [ incorrect ] ( http://www.heritage.org/~/media/images/reports/2014/02/bg2879/bg-gibraltar-map-1-825.ashx ) . 
  you would rather have them use guns ? 
  it 's a final warning . 
  true , many countries stopped doing it though . 
  initially they thought it would increase dental health of the population until they realized it led to decalcing of your bones . 
  they 're starting to remove it from tooth paste as well these days . 
  i do n't know what these symbols mean , but the speaker present said he supported hamas , they all chanted ` death to the jews ' and they said the dutch government are zionist dogs . 
  if that 's your kind of protest , go for it . 
   the baltics could be a buffer zone without nato and/or russia like ukraine ? 
  you probably know the schilderswijk , who does n't really . 
  [ example ] ( http://www.regio15.nl/images/2014/07/24/hoefkade/peen0342__1_.jpg ) on the hoefkade .

  there have been pro-isis protests in the hague with more attendents . 
  80 is likely the number of people they suspect to be in europe but of which they have no known whereabouts . 
  it means #pizzagate has gone international . 
  that does n't seem to be up to us with ukraine and all that . 
  swedish finnish and danish military combined could put up quite a fight . 
  nato is n't going to assist you militarily . 
  that 's what sparkling wine producers want you to believe . 
  what about that d\u00e9partement of france ? 
  dying was in the line of expectations , that 's what people like hillary do to persons that annoy them . 
  when you notice them they also notice you . 
  they know where to stand for that . 
  the only thing that worked was texting each other . 
  there can be no solutions without acknowledging the problem first and understanding it second . 
  people are n't ready for it . 
  sweden and finland do just fine without nato . 
  maybe they can create their own alliance , they all spend around 1,2 % . 
   to what , exactly , do we want to transition to ? 
  to a more equal , fairer and sustainable society . 
   this is true , but nationalists are do n't seem to propose sensible solutions , apart from blaming foreigners and immigrants . 
  i mean , brexit had no substance whatsoever and trump has no actual policies even now . 
  it 's not time for solutions yet , first stage is acknowledging you have a problem . 
  greece said it would veto all new accessions if cyprus was not admitted . 
  not that it matters , a country the size of cyprus is not a problem to have around . 
   they 're way too similar to us . 
  let 's not overstate things . 
  kanaal is not sewer , sewer = riool , and rioolrat can also be used as swear word . 
  not a bad idea now that you say it . 
  yes , as they 're the only ones relevant in determining which candidate has the most support . 
  wether it 's useless or useful is a different subject , point is , she has more support than fillon and nearly everyone else . 
  she 'll lose because the support for anyone else will vote against her no matter who will be her rival . 
  the second round is n't an indication for how much support a candidate has , the first is . 
  clearly she 's at the top being the candidate with the second most support , with more support than fillon . 
  she 'll lose in the second round because the support of other candidates will vote for anyone who will be her rival . 
  that 's not support for the other candidate , but hatred for le pen . 
  it does n't to win , but it indicates how much support each candidate has , which is what the conversation was about . 
  january 2016 * fillon 19 % le pen ** 28 % ** februari 2016 * fillon 18 % le pen ** 28 % ** april 2016 * fillon 18-23 % le pen ** 26-31 % ** november 2016 * fillon 20 % le pen ** 29 % ** etc. 
  you 're horrible at math . 
  these maniacs are n't power hungry anymore , they have their bellies filled with power . 
  the west as we know it at the moment is n't that great , so the question is wether change would be negative , i think not . 
  more likely this change is inevitable , and postponing it too long will make the transition more severe . 
  we 're facing growing inequality , social infighting , economic stagnation , dogmatic suppression of the rural and working class and greying societies , something is going to give way . 
  fillon has consistently polled below le pen , jupp\u00e9 slightly above . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election,_2017#opinion_polls_for_first_round_of_voting ), 
  without an answer to the question there 's nothing to read , it was a rhetorical question you could either answer by distancing yourself from your former reply which implied you follow the far-right , or it could be answered by what you already said . 
  you chose the latter . 
  you would follow the far-right , very well . 
  when i was a teenager in the winter when i cycled to highschool there would be a police check in front of the school . 
  they would literally write dozens of fines for all students that did n't have a light at + / - 7.30 am . 
  sometimes there were so many students they would just randomly pick some and the others were lucky . 
  luckily if you were younger than 18 you would have discount , a single light was 14 euro , no light at all 25 euro . 
  now it is always 50 euro for no lights i think . 
  this later extended to there always being a horsepower measuring device for all mopeds when i was over 16 . 
  i often had to return back home halfway there when classmates texted there was a ` rollerbank ' again . 
  my moped churned out 13 hp and would n't survive that check . 
  you did n't answer the question . 
  it is known . 
  they also eat babies and poke their teeth cavities with bones from dead kittens . 
  yes the author is missing the point , the article is just come incoherent rambling . 
  personality does play a role , le pen is a good speaker unlike her rivals . 
  solidarity , and perhaps some goodwill , the italians deserve that . 
  rather use eu funds to rebuild an italian landmark than have the pm of latvia construct another private guesthouse from it or victor orban another contract for his son . 
  my god what are you , an anarchist ? 
  if the far right jumps of a bridge will you too ? 
  users on / r/europe are n't happy with freedom or diversity of ideas , information and opinions . 
   disrupt democracy / elections . 
  really ? 
  do they station civilian brigades at polling station or something to keep people away ? 
  what are we to make of this ? 
   let 's be real . 
  okay , the reality is if turkey stopped militarily occupying an eu member and acknowledged the borders of another without violating it daily , and did not try to stir up trouble with their foreign communities their relation to the eu would 've been different . 
  they deserve that , but there 's turkey . 
  the kurds have recieved lots of support from assad as well , when the fsa/isis started slaughtering the kurds for no good reason but by local custom assad was the first to ship them weapons so that they could defend themselves . 
  modern day iraq is n't against either , although they do want a fair share of the oil regions . 
  today only turkey is really against a kurdish state . 
   a better question is why we do n't support the peshmerga and kurdish movement , we do . 
  netherlands and germany have been giving them weapons . 
  the netherlands has actually pulled that of quite clever by not stationing our airforce in turkey , but in jordan instead . 
  turks can complain , but not do anything about it . 
  germans have come around that by asking dutch c-130 's to transport their weapons to the kurds . 
   are renewables reliable source ? 
  only when we find a way to store it . 
  it would definitely show a different outcome . 
  phones in the us are usually sim-locked ( meaning it will accept only one provider ) american providers are n't present in europe . 
  this practice has been ` outlawed ' in the eu , to the point where providers are allowed to lock the phone on one provider , only if they provide the code to unlock it within a certain timeframe . 
  it 's also impossible to buy an iphone in the us without social security number . 
  so you should really read into this before doing it .
