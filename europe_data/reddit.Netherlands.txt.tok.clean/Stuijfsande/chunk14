  that 's why a dutch company proposed to build an island on the doggersbank , which would allow offshore turbines farther of the shore . 
  we already have a lot of windmills everywhere though , but the good places are all occupied . 
  the other places lead to quite serious confrontation with local inhabitants . 
  ( having a windmill in your backyard creates a constant buzz/humm and shade moving through your house , they solve this by bribing people , but people who do n't take the bribe , or are a couple of meters too far away to get a bribe get in fights with those that do ) we have literally seen fights in small villages here over the construction of wind mills , i have family in a village which is split right in two , half does n't want to talk or see the other half anymore , as half of them got a bribe , and the other did n't . 
  potential for hydro ? 
  no , absolutely not . 
  we have reversed potential for hydro , we pump water to the sea ** using ** electricity ( and oil ) , not generating it . 
  solar panels are possible , though not that great . 
  ( we do n't have a lot of sun ) . 
  wind mills are already used a lot , but we do n't have the room for them . 
  the lands are full , and the sea has the largest port in europe ( rotterdam ) . 
  no they did n't . 
  german plans to invade the uk predated us involvement in the european theater . 
  there 's a reason they were called off , they could n't make the crossing . 
  what do embassy workers have to do with this ? 
  why would it hurt him , there 's a reason we have visa 's . 
  it 's nothing personal . 
  overstaying or illegally working on visa 's . 
  the same reason the us does n't have visa free travel with much of the world either . 
  yes , they 're slightly below or slightly above belgium depending on the source ( imf , worldbank , cia ) you use . 
  nah it would be the same , shadow economy of poland is estimated at 26 % , belgium at 22 % and sweden at 18 % . 
  sweden ( 610 billion dollar ) would still be larger than poland ( 588 billion dollar ) as would the rest . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) ) [ 2 ] ( https://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/iea%20shadow%20economy%20web%20rev%207.6.13.pdf ) note that the imf uses a different metric , which makes poland the 9th economy ( slight below belgium instead of barely above ) in 2016 . 
  the point is there should n't be visa free travel for ukraine . 
  a delay is just a stopgap . 
  poland is the 8th economy as of 2016 , just above belgium and below sweden . 
  not just stored , most of it is refined in rotterdam and is then exported to fuel germany . 
  that is incorrect , the greatest share of imports come from germany ( 16,3 % ) , then belgium ( 9,5 % ) , not russia ( 7,1 % ) . 
  between belgium and russia there 's china ( 9,1 % ) and the us ( 7,7 % ) , so russia is only the 5th largest share of imports . 
  for those interested ; 40 % of russian export to the netherlands is raw oil . 
  ( rotterdam has a massive refinery industry ) , 32 % is refined petroleum . 
  5,3 % is gas ( is mixed with domestic gas ) , a further approx . 
  16 % is copper , nickel , iron , aluminum , kobalt etc.

  the serbs had managed to gather intelligence on us air operations , they knew where plane would be flying in from and took preparations , the modified radar they used could only detect the plane when it 's bomb bay doors were open . 
  5 finland 6 netherlands dear god , just when we were starting to get a head start . 
  happiest countries according to op 's source ; 1 . 
  costa rica 2 . 
  columbia [ ... ] 9 venezuela [ ... ] 76 * australia * [ ... ] ** 105 ** * usa * ^ ^ hahahaha , sure . 
  that 's a too narrow description in my opinion , populism is catering to public emotions without regards to context . 
  it does n't necessarily have to be ` poor against rich ' , but can also be ` black against white ' , or ` german against greek ' or any other sub-division . 
  not the most modern , certainly among the most powerful in europe . 
   which were ships built in the 1970s for the netherlands . 
  they 're refitted and modernized though . 
  the only thing that 's old is the hull , and that does n't matter in aegean due to the lack of maneuver warfare the navy 's would be facing . 
  these are n't combat helicopters . 
  a combat helicopter would be a boeing apache or eurocopter tiger . 
  there 's no such thing as soft german . 
  yes the colours ( red-white ) are . 
  ( 13th century ) , while the dutch tri-colours ' oldest reference is from 1409/1410 on an invoice for a royal mantle . 
  i know our government opposed it , i was just saying why it is that i do n't find any merit in that opposition . 
  sorry if that offended you . 
  no international inter-business sales are often without vat , it requires you to declare the vat you should 've paid and would have been refunded to you to your own authorities . 
  google or facebook is a nice example of that . 
  it avoids you having to meddle with irish authorities to get your vat refunded . 
  also charities or foundations , or separate activities of these , can be , depending on their activities , excluded from vat . 
  which means they do not charge vat to the ` consumer ' , but also do not get a refund on vat over their procurements . 
  last but not least , there can be several vat rates . 
  vat on essentials for example is 6 % in the netherlands , there 's also a 0 % rate ( ( house ) construction/renovation use to be 0 % due to the crisis ) all the rest is 21 % . 
  value added tax . 
  a sales tax that is added to your selling price as a commercial entity and paid by the customer to you ( which you then pay back to the authority ) vat on procurement is refunded . 
  so for example you run an audio shop . 
  you buy a speakerset for 50 euro at logitech , and sell it for 100 euro excl . 
  vat to a consumer . 
  you paid 60,50 to logitech for the speakerset , and the consumer paid 121 euro for the set . 
  10,50 is refunded to you , 21 euro is to be paid by you to the tax authority . 
  this is based on a 21 % rate ( that 's the rate in the netherlands ) , so you pay 10,5 euro in vat ( 21-10 ,5 ) , your added value here is 50 euro ( 100-50 = 50 ) 10,50 is 21 % of 50 euro , hence ' * value added * tax ' . 
  i was always taught that the netherlands delivered a frigate to russia , but russia had no flag at the time . 
  so by the necessity to pick one , they rearranged a dutch flag . 
   many of us believe we do !, 
  that 's the problem , you believe , yet this is not a religion we 're talking about . 
   europe shares many values and europe does not share many values . 
   as single nations wont be able to be very influential in the future they do n't need to be if you believe in the diversity of humanity , the co-existence of communities and mutual respect and consideration . 
  one needs a lot of influence to try and set the world to its own hand , but this is an attitude i find completely undesirable . 
   we believe that we would all benefit from working together . 
  working together comes in many forms . 
   it depends on how you see it really . 
  you could argue that your local community has no sovereignty because it does n't matter much when compared to your whole country . 
   my local community has no sovereignty , that could not be argued , that 's a fact , we 're in a social contract with a lot more local communities together forming 17,5 million people who are together sovereign . 
  we bled for this , we fought for this , we build this . 
  i 'm not saying this is not possible to be done in the eu , i just do n't find it desirable . 
   its all about how close people feel to each other and how willing they are to share a political system . 
  if you feel very close to dutch people and not close to other europeans at all you 'll obviously be opposed to federalisation , but many europeans including me feel very connected and believe that we would be stronger together . 
  i feel close to some europeans , not at all to others , but none of them as close as to my compatriots . 
  i believe we 're stronger together , it just do n't find strength an important social construct . 
   its about sharing sovereignty that 's really just being pedantic . 
  everybody will understand that that ` shared sovereignty ' has no meaningful irish contribution to it . 
  keeping romania out of schengen seems pointless . 
  schengen is merely the abolishment of physical border checks . 
  an argument could be raised against freedom of movement with romania , but if you grant the latter , what 's the point of refusing the former . 
  charming . 
  always are . 
   they blame themselves for getting raped . 
  should 've covered up . 
  us states also have their own vat rates , yet we do n't have amazon.tx or amazon.az . 
  the problem is that the regulatory body of the common market is a mess . 
  it should be framed more precisely/limited , and be giving hard rules , not guidelines . 
  and they say brexit supporters were stupid . 
  this is a whole new level . 
  reducing democracy to ` stupid ' and ` not stupid ' choices seems like a slippery slope .
