  yes , during recessions . 
  if the markets turn downwards , the government can relief the markets until they make a turn upwards again . 
  that 's keynesian economics , but that failed to work when countries decided good times should be even better , which has the result that bad times are even worse . 
  reduce debt now , and you will improve your leverage later . 
  many countries have already gone overboard though , countries like italy , portugal and greece can never improve their financial situation well enough until the next crisis hits . 
  that crisis may not be as hard as 2008 , but it will surely be hard on you guys . 
  by that time if we 're lucky our debt to gdp will be around 40 % so that we can borrow 20 % of our gdp to weather the crisis without breaking the fiscal compact . 
  ah , so they 're going to tie the eu relations to the referendum . 
  yes for strong independent turkey who need no eu , no for eu vassal state . 
  he might yet even win the referendum . 
  i 'm glad they did , it would really suck to be portugal or greece with a north sea climate . 
  we 're now the fastest growing developed economy i believe . 
  we surpassed the uk in 2016 . 
  3 , if you 're going to be edgy , at least pick the right number . 
  they borrow at close to zero now , but increase the debt and you 'll be borrowing at closer to 10 % once your economy starts tanking again . 
  now is the time to reduce debt , key is to remain solvent and stable for when times are dire . 
  on the contrary , it 's a whole lot easier , banning people based on nationality , ethnicity , or religion is illegal and basically impossible . 
  stricter immigration and integration rules and enforcement are not . 
  as in 80 % will vote in favour of the establishment of the new sultanate . 
  nobody uses this attack as a justification , but rather all attacks . 
  it 's completely irrelevant where somebody is born , a man from syria or a woman from eritrea can be the best persons out there , while a 2nd/3rd generation immigrant from the uk can be an utter douche and threat to everybody around him . 
  your place of birth is not important , neither is your skin color , asian eyes or blond hair . 
  what matters is the choices you make , and based on that the border should be closed to those that make the wrong choices , and open to those who do not . 
  definitely , the uk is our 3rd biggest trade partner . 
  but a bit of it should also be invested in defense , and some other budgets that have been neglected . 
  it should be divided . 
  the debt level will also decrease due to gdp growth . 
  a very good precedent . 
  hope they employ this a lot more often . 
  he said ` we beat them while working much less ' , which is not true . 
  i think the european balance is better , but that does n't mean we should lie . 
  no , even if you 're close to shore you 'll need the currents with you , but you can at least stay afloat for a couple of hours until help arrives . 
  not too fast , another year and we 're below 60 % debt to gdp , then we can spend it on all the women and booze we want . 
  most of these people ca n't swim , not to mention the holds are often locked by the smugglers . 
  once the boat goes , pretty much everybody dies . 
  a shame yet again , but we 'll see this happen often the next months as spring/summer sets in . 
   but someone bombing the country in which they were born being born somewhere is irrelevant . 
  the problem is an ideological one , not a geographical one . 
   in which case you present a sensible policy that actually addresses the problem , in other words , restricting the border . 
  that 's not a southern stereotype , but a racist stereotype . 
  racists are n't only in the south . 
  that 's what you get if you spend all your money on women and booze . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ could n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ resist, 
   our relations with turkey are probably at their lowest point for nearly a century . 
  welcome to the club . 
  the eu has created quite stringent quota 's to protect underwater life . 
  the main reasons iceland did not join the eu . 
  ( it would 've severely impacted their fishery , a large source of income ), 
  they already are ppp adjusted , first sentence if you had taken the effort to read . 
  yes christianity has been neutered and dropped in the hierarchy below the rule of law and humanism . 
  islam is still top of the food chain . 
  aegis is an american system used by japan , norway , south korea , spain and the us . 
  we use the dutch smart-l ewc/elr system , denmark and germany use the same . 
  it 's a different system , but it will be linked to the others . 
  you do n't necessarily need aegis , netherlands has its own system that is/will be part of the common bmd . 
  what missile launches from the middle east ? 
  unless israel is going full syria the only missile coming from there is some scud or tinkered scud the soviets once supplied . 
  americans earn quite a bit more than germans . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage ) but that seems fair , if you work more you earn more . 
  this is not a political thing here . 
  most people , including politicians , do n't know and do n't care . 
  nice sultan you 've got there , it would be a shame if something happened to him . 
  since there are border checkpoints here and there again it could be the border , it could also be on the street if for whatever reason you need to identify . 
  well yea since there 's been attention to it lately . 
  i do n't visit mosques , well at least not here , so i had no idea . 
   that needs to be centralised really with that kind of attitude i would surely hope not . 
   its dumb that visas work like that when free movement is a thing . 
  freedom of movement is for citizens of eu memberstates , not people entering on a visa . 
  but not in its power . 
  countries have their own visa policies . 
   albania --  since the birth of the islamic state , a significant number of foreign fighters have been recruited from the western balkans , including at least 1,000 fighters from albania . 
  you mean the country with the largest per capita isis recruits in europe ? 
   there are big muslim communities in south africa -------  muslims accounted for 1.5 % of the population , you must mean a different south africa then . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_africa#religion )  iran --  the u.s. government classifies the islamic republic of iran as the `` most active state sponsor of terrorism . '' the u.s. has designated iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 . 
  you mean that iran ? 
  [ 2 ] ( https://www.unitedagainstnucleariran.com/terrorism )  uzbekistan --  terrorism in uzbekistan is more prevalent than in any other central asian state . 
  [ 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_uzbekistan ) --  and there 's been a significant muslim presence in western europe for decades , why is islamic terrorism only a relatively new thing ? 
  islamic terrorism is not a new thing , it 's just new in europe due to the recent arrival of islam here . 
  just for clarity , the diyanet and its 143 imams refused to comment on the matter . 
  the ` disapproval ' came from other organisations . 
  interference would imply a certain distance , the organisation is more run by turkey then it is interfered by it . 
  it was especially interesting seeing the recordings that all imams have the exact same speeches . 
  a pretty obvious indication that someone in ankara is right now writing a speech that all turkish imams will be giving tomorrow , or next week , or next month . 
  60 already , it retired in greece 5 years ago , 6,5 more years and it 's going to retire here too . 
  such as ? 
  they 're not just being paid by the turkish government , they ** are ** the turkish government . 
  the diyanet is part of the turkish ministry of general affairs . 
  it 's a state institution . 
  it falls directly under the turkish prime minister . 
  that authority is the diyanet . 
  inviting people over temporarily , accept that they wo n't leave , let turkey manage integration because they 're staying . 
   and ~ ~ the usa ~ ~ trump is openly questioning nato . 
  everytime trump says something bad about nato , the next one in the us administration apologizes , and trump rectifies his statements . 
  the us is not equal to trump , and they 're still very much invested in nato . 
  they will remain so provided we show a bit more effort deserving of solidarity . 
  we do n't have a stereo-party democracy a la us . 
  with a 33 % increase in seats ` the fascists ' certainly ` won ' in the sense of a pluralist democracy . 
  not to mention a similar party emerged with 2 seats . 
  he did n't insult anybody , he just ran , as you put it , into an asshole in the morning . 
  it has everything to do with terrorism .
