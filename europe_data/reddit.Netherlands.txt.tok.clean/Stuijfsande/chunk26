  considering the washingtonpost status as the pravda of the us together with the ny-times , i 'm not surprised . 
  but they 're not the ones tasked with foreign policy . 
  that 's merkels and her fm 's job . 
  brushing this of to the mayors is weak . 
  they ca n't be expected to weather international pressure and be left alone . 
  you protect your mayors if you have an ounce of statemenship , they account to you as a pm , and you account to foreign governments . 
   only 8 % of the population considered themselves to be british only at the last scottish census  interesting , because scotland is british . 
  it 's part of great britain after all , wether it is independent or not . 
  do a lot of people jump from the upper balconies ? 
  they wanted to distinguish themselves more from their partner airfrance i take it . 
  no , it is weak to do what most voters and the rest of europe want her to do but then act as if you 're not involved and the mayors are the ones doing it . 
  we have the state pension ( aow ) and mandatory participation in private pensions . 
  the former is paid from general taxation , the latter from saving and investing funds . 
  the 1000-1200 billion euro is simply the amount of assets the private pension funds own . 
  it 's really high for people who have never lived in a country and only visited it on a holiday with their parents once . 
  merkel is weak . 
  she decided to hide behind her mayors , and that 's supposed to be the pm . 
  threatening , lying to , decieving , and invading a country is more than a good reason . 
  50 % of dutch turks vote in turkish elections . 
   the whole thing became a dogfight and now he is even more stronger anyway . 
  that 's your problem though . 
  the only thing we care about is that you keep these petulant fools in turkey , and not stirring up shit and looking for a fight in other countries . 
  turkey meddling in our affairs has lasted long enough now , we 've had way too much tolerance and patience for those not deserving of any of it . 
   only a fifth consists of real dutch investments . 
  which would be 900 billion dollars in 2012 , which seems to confirm my own source which put the figure at 1088 billion euro in 2015 . 
  for comparison total fdi inflow into turkey in 2015 amounted to 17 billion dollars , which would be about 1,5 % of total * real * dutch fdi holdings . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.invest.gov.tr/en-us/investmentguide/investorsguide/pages/fdiinturkey.aspx ) about 18 % of that 17 billion dollar comes from the netherlands , in other words about 3,06 billion dollar , or roughly 0,25 % of total real dutch fdi holdings . 
  sure , i 'm use to it . 
  many people always see themselves as victims , i suppose it removes the need for you to have decency or responsibility . 
  i 'm sorry if i victimized you . 
  but i 'm just observing here . 
  it 's a high level diplomatic conflict , that does n't happen very often . 
  the coming days we 'll see a lot of news about it , then it will change to different subjects again . 
   also pensions do not count into fdi unless they are actually investing in a country , which would be crazy . 
  and in real life does not happen , i was just pointing something out sorry . 
  that 's exactly what they do . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.nu.nl/economie/3782339/pensioenfondsen-investeren-miljarden-in-economie.html ) only 14 % of the pension funds are invested in our own country . 
   yes the netherlands has big companies but it is also part of a tax efficiency scheme , fiat-chrysler is a ` dutch ' company for this very same reason which is causing fdi inflow due to a lack of taxes on capital gains , not outflow . 
  just repeating the same mantra does n't make it any less false . 
  gdp is added wealth , owned assets are n't added wealth . 
  the netherlands has the 5th largest current account surplus in the world [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_current_account_balance ) , which means a lot of wealth is accumulated . 
  wealth that is then used to invest . 
  this is different for countries like spain , italy or the uk , which are mostly inwards orientated markets . 
  they invest in their own , they consume , they accumulate debt . 
  while they have more money , they keep more of it inside their borders . 
   i 'm sorry i did n't know the netherlands was the biggest economic power in europe , or are those other countries lagging behind in foreign investment because you 're all so smart ? 
  or you could just stay serious and not descent into idiocy when you lose the argument . 
   still seem weird though , why does the netherlands have such a large share ? 
  it 's not like other countries do n't have pension funds , a large financial industry and multinationals . 
  why is germany and the uk so much lower ? 
  because we 've relatively a lot of money . 
  there 's more money in the dutch pension funds then there 's in the italian . 
  and because some companies are historically very active in turkey ( notably shell and philips )  also luxembourg being so high up on the list makes it obvious that this table does n't actually show where the money comes from . 
  because luxemburg has tax rules that facilitate outflow . 
  i 'm sure you think that you do , but it only serves to reinforce your ignorance on the matter . 
  if you want to talk legally , the turkish minister entering the country with armed guards in armoured cars legally amounted to a military invasion and required the deployment of anti-terrorist units to remove the threat . 
  so it 's time for you to read up on them . 
  i 'll be sure to tell it when i manage to find the first one . 
  not syrup waffels . 
  freedom of association is wider than freedom of gathering , freedom of gathering is limited in international law . 
  you ca n't just stand with 1000 people on a highway for example . 
  they had the right to a public gathering , it was offered to turkey , but turkey denied it and decided to lie , decieve and threaten the authorities which is illegal . 
  no it does n't . 
  tax structures are related to royalties , thus fdi inflow , not outflow . 
  this reflects huge pensions funds ( 1000-1200 billion euro in dutch pension funds ) and a large financial industry as well as some large multinationals ( ing , nn , achmea , aegon , shell , unilever , philips , asml etc. ), 
  the law can not be invoked based on the subject or content of the gathering , but only based on reasons relating to public security and public order . 
  this requires you to ask prior permission from the authorities to have a public gathering , the municipality then decides where you can hold this gathering and can prepare accordingly . 
  turkey thought it was too important to ask authorities , and instead lied to , threatened and decieved the authorities . 
  [ this ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/noodverordening ) law . 
  there 's freedom of gathering , but turkey decided not to make use of it . 
  [ yes ] ( http://recreatiewiringherlant.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/afsluitdijk.gif ) , guarded by [ castle black ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/stelling_kornwerderzand ) . 
  we 're not ice walkers beyond the wall , we 're ice skaters instead . 
  gelukkige verjaardag sounds like a google translate of ` happy birthday ' . 
  i 've never heard it being used , but then again , we do have a lot of dialects , maybe it 's common in holland . 
  technically it 's not incorrect or anything , to me it just sounds like anglified dutch . 
  to make the sentence complete it would be ` gefeliciteerd met je broer ! ' . 
  ( congratulations with your brother ), 
  we 've [ tools for that ] ( http://cms.boerenbusiness.nl/upload/files/10712701_schillen.jpg ) . 
  i just eat them whole though , this is more the sort of thing cultured people inside the canals of amsterdam do . 
  the chaos of a french party would turn us mad . 
  also do n't forget to convers with the ones sitting right or left of you , if you speak with someone on the other side of the circle , only two conversations can be had by pausing for each to speak . 
  of course , you 're belgian , you get smaller portions of everything . 
  damn finland , this is a bad timing for your rare win over us . 
  would n't it be ` bananaconstitutionalmonarchy ' ? 
  we have n't been a republic since 1795 . 
  no it means that for example 86 % of the people who intend to vote for wilders support the current governments actions . 
  the question is ` do you think the dutch government handled the situation well ? ', 
  the break-down in parties shows allegiance of those answering . 
  so overall 86 % of the voters think they handled the situation well , 98 % of the vvd voters think that , 86 % from the pvv , 82 % from d66 etc. 
  i read it from [ this ] ( http://www.hollandturkeytrade.com/images/faqanswers/a9.doc ) document , from [ this ] ( http://www.hollandturkeytrade.com/ ) website . 
   the netherlands has contributed nearly 18 percent of total fdi since 2005 but it 's not surprising , the netherlands is for example the 3rd largest foreign investor in the us ( we invest more in the us than canada , germany or france ) . 
  this is mostly due to our huge pension funds ( they have an investment fund of about 1000-1200 billion euro ) and large financial industry . 
  [ from the mayor ] ( https://youtu.be/5dtlpz7osk8 ) of rotterdam . 
  ( at about 1:06 ` the decievery became even more serious when they travelled in several convoys ' . 
  this was the decoy convoy . 
  they made it look like the minister was in this convoy , the convoy was halted , but the minister secretly took a different convoy . 
  ( that 's why she made it to the consulate ), 
  i do n't think the turkish administration is smart enough to think that through . 
  ` oh look a small country , why did n't no one tell me they have a bigger economy than we do ' . 
  that may be a hollandish custom , up here in the north beyond the wall you only congratulate first line family members .
