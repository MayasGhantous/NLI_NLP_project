  the minimum wage is something different . 
  minimum wage is currently around 1580 euro and the legal minimum base level is about 1000 euro per month . 
  if you have a job but rearn less than 1000 euro you get welfare until you earn 1000 euro . 
  the bureaucracy , that 's all really . 
  you need to fill in forms , speak to people , you get different welfare checks each month ( one special one for your healthcare insurance , one special one for your rent , one special one as basic income , and then there 's still a dozen of others for specific cases , ca n't pay a washing machine ? 
  then you get a one-time benefit , have n't lived in the netherlands ? 
  then you get aio instead of aow etc. 
  the system is pretty intransparent , people do n't really know what sort of rights they have and it 's basically pumping around money from closet to closet . 
  they do . 
  people who earn a wage beneath the minimum recieve welfare until they 're on the minimum . 
  i 'm assuming he has a dutch passport , so he has the same rights as anyone else . 
  all dutch citizens have a legal , annually determined , ` base minimum ' living standard . 
  he 'll have to claim it though , it 's not thrown in his lap . 
  so he might need help there . 
  why would n't he be ? 
  they 're your guests , not theirs . 
  alright , best wishes . 
  between willing countries . 
  forcing refugees on countries that both do n't want them , nor them they , is a terrible idea . 
  you seriously did n't know that ? 
  it 's been probably the biggest meme on the subject of defense in europe since the last 130 or so were sold to finland . 
  that depends on the metric you use . 
  the netherlands has an expeditionary army with global force projection and a green water navy . 
  sweden has a self defense force . 
  the former can wield firepower anywhere in the world , the latter only at home . 
  but the latter will have more firepower , because it 's cheaper . 
   the questions of today are whether large conscription army is able to mobilize itself quickly enough if it 's needed . 
  probably not . 
  if you wanted to , you need vast stockpiles of material ( munitions , uniforms , canned food , rifles/guns , fuel etc. ), 
  ready , a large number of vacant military facilities to train/house conscriptees and a large number of spare instructors as well as a command network . 
  i do n't think anybody except finland does any of these things anymore . 
  cluster munitions or he fragmentation shells . 
  most commonly used field artilery by the dnr/lnr are d-30 's and 2a65-152mm . 
  because state policy does n't work based on individuals , but on groups . 
  you do n't start a welfare scheme for henk jan on the corner of steenbergstraat in rotterdam either . 
  you start a welfare scheme for everybody earning below x euro , thus grouping people . 
  solving crime and violation of public order predominantly present in a certain group ca n't be solved by looking at individuals , but can only be solved by looking at the group . 
  what drives them , why ca n't it be prevented , why are young members of the group attracted to it , why do they pick certain suspects , what helped others of the group quit the behaviour , how can we best communicate etc. 
  nobody is blaming all moroccans . 
  no problem , the title was already pretty long , so i added it in a comment , but you beat me to it by replying before i could . 
   not so long ago this feature used to be seen as a joke . 
  and it was english voice to english text so yeah . 
  did n't expect for it to be good . 
  it 's improving . 
  as long as it 's either to or from english . 
  it 's quite decent . 
  there are a couple of mix-ups , but i checked the english subtitles before posting and they 're quite well enough . 
  there 's english subtitles . 
  you can switch them on . 
  the video has decent english subtitles . 
  i realized nearly nobody knows about this , but since the last 2 months there have already been 26 earth quakes in the dutch province of groningen . 
  many homes are damaged , demolished and proclaimed too dangerous to live in . 
  the government and the commercial exploitants have so far neglected their responsibilities which have in the recent election campaign and before resulted in much anger and despair of the local population . 
  add a gold chain and you 've got yourself a romanian one . 
  the ban on the sale/reprint of mein kampf is illegal too . 
  ( they did n't own the copyright , and it 's even expired anyway ) the government does n't really care about laws when it suits them . 
  took a while for me to realize there 's a titanic in the picture too . 
   can you explain why the dutch government wants `` smart meters '' in every home ? 
  that one kinda ' surprised me . 
  is it just for the `` automatic meter reading '' benefits that 's part of it , in the future probably for network management . 
  if for example there 's going to be a time when all homes are equiped with a battery , that can be used intelligently by the grid manager . 
  people considering solar panels should try and keep their old analogue meters anyway . 
  with these you deliver energy back to the grid 1:1 , with a digital one the exchange is something like 4:1 . 
  ( you need to deliver 4kw to be able to purchase one back ) these old things just count down 1kw if you give back 1kw . 
  not everything in the world is about us , china and russia . 
  shitposting gets downvoted . 
  i gave you a chance , no instant downvote , but if you keep repeating butthurt nonsense about a small currency while it 's solidly moderately sized , even large in international sense , you 're getting a downvote . 
  if you have good intend for discussion you can earn an upvote if you 're so interested in karma . 
  that 's fine , it 's not intended to be a currency for anybody else than the 17,1 million dutch people and those who do trade with us . 
  considering the 5th most traded currency in the world is the swiss franc , and the 8th most traded currency is the south african rand , both being smaller economies than the netherlands , we 'll do just fine with a moderately sized currency . 
  it will be much more stable and valuable than the euro . 
  i suppose the next one who 's leaving will make it easier as well . 
  in fact it would be infinetely more easier when everybody except one left . 
  sure it 's very interesting . 
  but not very promising from a practical point of view yet . 
  but non-practical testing of new technologies is n't any less interesting . 
  they may have at one point been , but never succeeded thus far . 
  ( and no , the concept is n't new , many attempts have been made )  orbital rlvs are thought to provide the possibility of low cost and highly reliable access to space . 
  however , reusability implies weight penalties such as non-ablative reentry shielding and possibly a stronger structure to survive multiple uses , and given the lack of experience with these vehicles , the actual costs and reliability are yet to be seen . 
  landing is only interesting if you 're bringing humans for settlement to other planets and back . 
  it 's a waste of money to land a rocket that brings a sattelite in orbit . 
  they refused to do it before . 
  that 's why only the us is a supplier in the nato nucleair sharing . 
  an 800 billion dollar economy , slightly larger than turkey , of the 5th largest trading economy of the world is hardly reason for a small currency . 
  top-left insignia looks legit . 
  how could you tell ? 
  it 's a different poll . 
   the question asked respondents which of 3 options they preferred , the results are below :  39 % = eu  23 % = efta ( european free trade association )  27 % = fta ( free trade agreement )  11 % = do n't know  without do n't knows  56 % = nexit ( efta + fta )  44 % = eu  1,174 people were polled over 14-15/2 / 17  the results show also ( without do n't knows ) :  men 56 % nexit ( efta + fta ) , 44 % eu  women 57 % nexit ( efta + fta ) , 43 % eu  also ** all age groups 25 and over support nexit ** options and ** all regions prefer nexit , ** even in the large cities a majority prefer the alternatives to eu membership . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://www.brugesgroup.com/blog/will-the-netherlands-be-the-next-domino-to-fall ) the document you linked is a different poll . 
  pinging / u/aken _ bosch , found some more information . 
  it 's so funny fooling around with the armed forces of formerly one of the , if not the most evil regime ever seen on this planet next to a neighbouring country with which there 's a political tumultuous situation and a history of total warfare . 
  ha-ha-ha . 
  these are 2 separate polls i believe . 
  if the netherlands would leave the euro , we would see an increase in purchasing power of about 8,4 % . 
   grafiek morgan stanley research ( april 2015 ) -- the unfair value of the euro for all euro-countries according to morgan stanley 's 2015 ppp-analyses of the relative changes in competitiveness ( consumer and producer prices ) for each country since 1999 -- because only the netherlands entered the euro with its national currency substantially ( 13 procent ) undervalued , for the netherlands the present ` fair value ' euro exchange rate is now 1,40 dollar . 
  according to a poll of february 2017 from maurice de hond more than 50 % want to leave , 39 % wants to stay . 
  which means even britain would rather stay in the eu than the netherlands . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://www.perssupport.nl/persbericht/a947a3b4-2410-4f56-a2a4-0f72c345ea97/peiling-maurice-de-hond-meerderheid-nederlanders-wil-nexit ) of those wanting to leave , only 23 % want to remain the single market , 27 % only wants bilateral trade treaties . 
  people are feeling increasingly powerless , and that 's part of being in the eu . 
  so i would n't be surprised if we go out in a couple of years .
