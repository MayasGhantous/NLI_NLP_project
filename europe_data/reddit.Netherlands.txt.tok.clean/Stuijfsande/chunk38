  it 's not training people to defend their country that 's the issue here , and you know it . 
  sweden does n't have a minimum wage , but unions instead that bargain wages . 
  though i suspect conscriptees wo n't be given a union to bargain a wage . 
  ( they do n't have anything to bargain over , their labour is owned , not given in exchange of ), 
  that 's what plantation owners said , they do n't have a duty . 
  if you want details i can give them to you . 
  germany 66 % 1979 48 % 2014 , ** 18 % decline ** . 
  ireland 64 % 1979 52 % 2014 , ** 12 % decline ** . 
  france 61 % 1979 42 % 2014 , ** 19 % decline ** . 
  italy 86 % in 1979 57 % 2014 , ** 29 % decline ** . 
  netherlands 58 % 1979 37 % 2014 , ** 21 % decline ** . 
  there 's only two that increased in the eu-9 , and that 's denmark from 48-56 % and the uk 32-36 % . 
  even the countries with mandatory voting ( belgium , luxemburg ) saw a decline ( 2 and 3 % respectively ) . 
  so far the eu-9 . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.ukpolitical.info/european-parliament-election-turnout.htm ), 
   freedom always has a price . 
  indeed , a price they 're not willing to pay . 
  sugar , cotton and coffee also had a price , it was solved in the same fashion by conscripting young african and asian males . 
  but it was since decided that 's not a good way to avoid paying the price . 
  well except in sweden apparently . 
  you can read the graph , voter turnout went from 62 % in 1979 to 49 % in 1999 , a 13 % drop before the large ex-communist eastern expansion , and has since dropped to 43 % in 2009 and 42,6 % in 2014 as it continues downwards .

  going to school is not a duty to your country . 
  you 're ` forced ' , you 're not actually , your parents are , because if you 're 12 years old you ca n't decide for yourself . 
  for your personal development and base to function within society . 
   this is true only if schengen does n't exist . 
  cyprus , romania , bulgaria and croatia are n't part of schengen . 
  shocking is n't it , the rate at which people develop in their adolescense . 
  did the referendum only decide that british youth will leave the eu ? 
  $ 100 per month give or take ? 
  or perhaps a normal starter wage of $ 2000 ? 
  there 's the problem then . 
  in the netherlands we 've the opposit , tons of people willing to work at the defense because of the very royal primary and secondary benefits . 
  ( being able to obtain a free truck license , maritime credentials , perhaps a helicopter or plane license if you 're lucky , all the while being paid for it ) you can even study more general courses at a military academy , like engineering , medicines , construction while getting a near full wage ( sometimes even pay upfront ) instead of paying for college and getting practically nothing . 
  there 's not enough vacancies though . 
   naturally , conscripting more people will require more money . 
   only a fraction of what the civilized alternative would cost . 
   no we 're not , and of course there is a duty to your country . 
  civilization itself is built on that very idea . 
  there 's no duty to your country unless you yourself consider there to be one . 
  welcome to a free society . 
   because the eu allow it . 
  not because it 's right . 
   because these visa treaties predate the eu . 
   the eu can require full reciprocity . 
  the eu can only require it for a schengenvisa . 
  countries have their own visa agreement with the us which wo n't change . 
   a citizen of every eu country is an eu citizen . 
  it 's not as you put it , since you said ` all ' eu citizens ' rights are defended , and mine , as well as millions of others , are not and are potentially harmed . 
   and you 're harming the other eu countries by not being willing to defend their rights . 
  so much for eu solidarity . 
  we comply with us demands for visa free travel , nothing is stopping the other countries from seeking a similar agreement . 
  they have no automatic right to visa free travel with the us , there 's nothing for us to defend . 
  it 's america 's decision . 
  it 's very eu'ish , i 'll give them that . 
   personally i am of the conviction that the current amount of people we train is not enough . 
  it 's very selective in denmark . 
   then you need to spend more money . 
   one of them however is a duty to your country so your country can defend itself . 
  there 's no ` duty to your country ' , we 're not north korea . 
  if they want that they can join a sportsclub . 
  by their own decision . 
   the point of the eu is that all countries must treat every eu member the same . 
  usa/canada can not pick and choose which countries in the eu they will require a visa for . 
   obviously they can , and have for quite a while . 
   either all eu require a visa or none do . 
  the eu can only require a schengenvisa . 
  they can still travel without visa to the netherlands for example , it 's just that travelling from there or switching flights is more difficult . 
   if the eu parliament vote to put visa on us citizens it will be them defending the rights of all eu citizens . 
  for once , doing their job . 
  what ` all ' eu citizens ? 
  if the us in response reciprocates they 're harming my rights , not defending them . 
   absolute nonsense . 
  sorry , but the nordic countries do not have a lot of people , thus we need capable to know how . 
   there are enough people , the nordics just do n't want to pay them . 
   it 's conscription , not kidnapping . 
  conscription and kidnapping have a lot in common , both are taking and holding someone against their own will . 
  it 's not . 
  polishing boots , walking like a robot , and slicing potatos is n't education . 
  the fact that you 're swedish is irrelevant , conscription was and is done in multiple countries . 
  countries can still provide visa free travel to us citizens , it just means that they ca n't travel to all eu members as easily anymore once they 're here . 
  it 's useless for their development , and in no way a form of school/education . 
  what are they paid ? 
  it seems to be controversial here to think young people should 've rights . 
  it 's funny because they ca n't spend on armed forces because they spend it on , among others , eritreans who flee conscription , and to afford that they force swedes to be conscripted instead . 
  by paying people to work for the armed forces . 
  school is for their own development , forced service is for the pleasure of old men who do n't want to spend money on things they do n't like . 
  were the demolition crew kurdish ? 
  we should make a statement and only accept asylum requests directly from camps in the region . 
  that 's where legitimate refugees are . 
   asking the youth is not necessary of course that 's necessary if you have any morals and empathy . 
   and kind of silly if you are thinking of people below the age of 18 . 
  what 's silly is kidnapping children to work without wage . 
  two actually . 
  in the netherlands we do 3 , and that is going to be awkward if you do that to a french . 
  ( been there , done that ), 
  yes it differs , both in number and gender . 
  some french males kiss each other too , most awkward thing ever . 
  anyway i think it 's 2 in france . 
  but you do n't need to , generally it 's only a thing if you 're acquainted and in the persona sphere , if you do n't feel comfortable doing it do n't do it .
