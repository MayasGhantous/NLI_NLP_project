  that is correct . 
  which is why it 's such a bad idea to have a european army . 
  i 'm sure you know better than the pm , fm , now vice-president of the european commission , and the justice department . 
  aruba , a couple of dozen miles west of curacao , was invaded in 2014 . 
  the venezuelans saw their chance the moment mh17 was shot down and moved their navy into a firing line inside our sovereign waters . 
  it was only averted at the very last moment . 
  you 're either naive , or genuinely wish ill upon other people . 
  the global order is complex , and the devil is in the details . 
  how are you going to defend curacao if/when venezuela attacks ? 
  and what about cyprus should the turkey-greek dispute reignite again ? 
  often there really is n't a difference between an offensive or defensive army , what you 're really trying to say is that you want an army that 's not going to fight either way , or at least not until the bombs fall in your own backyard . 
  let 's just add the others to avoid stepping on too much sensibilities . 
  agreed , and if they do n't ` listen ' , become straight so to say , they put them in concentration camps . 
  a purely defensive european army ca n't defend it 's members . 
  the nato nucleair sharing only uses american nukes . 
  ( b-61 's to be precise ) the british do n't have their own nukes , they have the american trident system . 
  the french do n't share their weapons . 
  ( and they have much more complicated weapons than the b-61 's found in italy or the netherlands ), 
  not everything is about race . 
  also they 're claiming to be holier than the pope and singing bible verses about how bad the us/west is in syria , while killing innocent ukrainians by the thousands without any regard to a single law . 
  these people are so incredibly low . 
  people are not entitled to our concerns . 
  of course we 're concerned more about countries that affect us , just like all people on this earth . 
  it 's exactly that actually , they would be dismissed because they are n't in europe . 
  the turkey dispute would n't help their cause , sure . 
  but they would still be denied . 
  the end of the eu . 
  there would be no point in continuing a political union without france . 
  cyprus is not in europe . 
  even the european commission reiterated that , the only reason it was able to join in the first place ( and morocco not after applying ) was that greece would veto any new accession if we did n't . 
  we should give it to the french , carve out an airstrip and dig a tunnel to scotland . 
  would solve the calais problems . 
  it 's actually pretty easy , it ends half way in istanbul and at the caucasus/urals . 
  anything else are emotional arguments . 
  they still have one of those dutch villages as a tourist attraction in nagasaki . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/nagasaki_dejima_c1771.jpg/800px-nagasaki_dejima_c1771.jpg ) [ old situation ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hnlmbzcqma0/uwxy3xhydai/aaaaaaaabpc/01jvhqv1yty/s1600/dejima.jpg ), 
  without the uk the total gdp of 2016 in current prices would be 12.432 billion euro . 
  * germany would have 3123 billion euro ** 25 % ** * france would have 2220 billion euro ** 17,9 % ** * italy would have 1672 billion euro ** 13,4 % ** * spain would have 1110 bilion euro ** 8,9 % ** * netherlands would have 700 billion euro ** 5,7 % **, 
  the soviet navy had a different strategy than the west . 
  the ussr did have more ` warm water ports ' in the baltics and ukraine . 
  but western navy 's were carefuly picked together machines , where a dozen ships each had their own purpose and together they made up a functional flottilla . 
  the russians just build a huge ship and put every weapon imaginable on its deck , so that one ship could bismarck style take on a flottilla . 
  and losing it would n't create a hole in your naval abilities . 
  90-00 was just a great time in the west , full of change , optimism , improvement and hope . 
  that changed . 
  and in times like these people look for power and leadership , something the eu could n't provide , or perhaps was unfairly expected to . 
  either way it disappointed people , we all gave up a slice of our ` sovereignty ' in matters and it appeared that that which was supposed to replace it is highly dysfunctional and unstable . 
  in no small part due to a too quick enlargement to the east and failling eurozone . 
  in these years the eu should 've grown in depth ( integration between western partners ) not width ( adding half of europe as new members ), 
  there never was a power in europe as a union . 
  it was individual states who were powerful . 
  i do n't know , wouldn ; t think so , but it was a beautiful day today here . 
  very hot and sunny , half the country is just putting out the barbeque . 
  going to the beach was certainly possible . 
  20.000 did n't lose their job , their job just changed to a competitive consumer orientated one instead of a protected state cash cow . 
  separate states . 
  they should look into vacating the british sovereign base area 's and agree on a border so that they can eventually remove the un border zone . 
  netherlands . 
  20 + degrees and sun , genuine summer day . 
  in fact russia bombed a hospital 4 hours after the chemical attack , which some suspect was an attempt to clean up ` evidence ' . 
  ( wounded people being treated ), 
  yes . 
  so the uk will not negotiate trade deals , and the eu will include the uk in new trade deals for the time being . 
  ` got attacked ' and ` got attacked in ww2 ' are two separate things . 
  on the 4th of may we remember our casualties of ww2 and since , that is not a date of celebration . 
  rules dictate the uk ca n't negotiate a trade deal . 
  what it 's really about is violating the rules that suits you best . 
  many countries do n't account for underemployment either . 
  for example a 4 hour contract makes you employed , but you might as well be unemployed . 
  the netherlands use to count underemployment as partially unemployed , we quit doing that about 2 years ago for some window dressing , and our economy is great now . 
   the ecb is also lowering interest rates into the negatives to force the money that already exists out and about in the economy . 
  not completely , they are forcing the money out of central banks deposits to regain inter-institution confidence , but the banks still have nowhere to put it so they think of elaborate schemes that amount to the same effect as idle deposits . 
   a currency is n't a product btw . 
  a currency is a product too , regardless exchange rates are normally determined by the market , simple matter of demand and supply of a currency . 
   and after a hundred or so years of experimenting , we 've learned that stability with slight depreciation works best for everyone . 
  not `` whatever the market decides '' . 
  far from it , in fact we 've done away with all ` stability ' mechanisms like the gold standard and dollar peg . 
  depreciation and appreciation is needed as a cause-effect relation . 
  the medallions being tradeable is n't the problem , the problem is a government imposed shortage where the market should be setting accounts . 
  if we would hoard all food and make people starve we can also sell a loaf of bread for $ 1000 , but that 's not how things are supposed to function . 
  sounds good . 
  maybe northern ireland can join schengen . 
  i know , that 's what makes it the worst . 
  the local government owns the market and behaves like a malicious monopolist to suck working folk dry and avoid competition . 
  it would be great if the local government lost the ability to issue medallions due to \u00fcber . 
  that 's terrible . 
  luckily the taxi business is collapsing in new york from 50.000 drivers in 2014 to 30.000 in 2016 . 
  a few more of these years and the organized theft can be stopped . 
  they wo n't go ballistic , without imf there wo n't be another bail-out , and i think many germans would 've peace with that . 
   we will get self driving cars anyway , we can trust on italy to ban it in italy though . 
  and then whine for eurozone transfers when its economy remains grounded . 
   in italy , cities issue a set number of taxi licenses annually , which can cost up to 200,000 euros ( $ 212,000 ) , forcing drivers to stay on the road for years to pay it off . 
  appalling . 
  i 've no other words for it . 
  someone drag these cities from the 19th century into the 21st please . 
  because it 's been portrayed as something it is not , leading to unreasonable expectations and a train of disappointment . 
  i 'm afraid i may have phrased things in a too high abstraction level for you to understand it . 
  however i 'm not going to talk in sesame street language so you can understand it . 
  that 's not what is said . 
  pretty sure trump would 've made it 10 feet higher .
