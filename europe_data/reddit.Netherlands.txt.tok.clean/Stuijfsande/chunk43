  yes she did , and she does n't regret it . 
  even when she lived in the us the dutch government kept providing her security , until there was a controversy , for a while but for her the us is just safer . 
  as the quote showed apart from safety she prefered the netherlands . 
  but in her last days she was hid by the government on a royal marines base to protect her . 
  which also meant secrecy , not being able to just visit relatives/friends , phone and email communication monitored etc. 
  i ca n't blame you , i think we do n't make a verbal distinction between ` political islam ' and ` islam ' a lot . 
  in english people tend to be more fragile and sensitive to offense . 
  but in dutch it is usual ` islam did/does this ' , often followed by ` of course there are also good followers of islam ' or something similar instead of making a prior distinction between radical and moderate followers of islam . 
  islamism and political islam is the same thing , in dutch though ` politieke islam ' is more common than ` islamisme ' .

  the sudden irresistible desire to insert a sharp object in - or discharge a projectile at a person that has offended an imaginary idol called allah and/or his medieval pedophile mohammed by members of his cult . 
  or more seriously , ` political islam ' is islam as a totalitarian ideology whereby islam is not a religion , but the literal word of islam is society . 
  the laws are the sharia , the state is the caliphate , the leader is a successor of mohammed . 
  you 're right , i searched it and read 10 million km2 , but it actually is 4,5 ( eu ) vs 8,5 ( brazil ) and 17,5 for russia . 
  brazil is about as large as the eu though . 
  because it was in a personal union with the netherlands , it 's also the reason it 's not part of the netherlands . 
  ( german claims prevented us from annexxing it proper ) this lasted until our king abdicated and we got a queen , luxemburg had laws that did n't recognize female succession . 
  i 'm pouring myself some tea from russels ' teapot , would you like some too ? 
   and if energy is necessarily lost within every system - particularly if they 're doing anything that requires using more of it , such as moving , emitting light , or making spooky sounds - it would be impossible for them to maintain their existence for any significant period of time . 
  i 'm not a physicist , but do n't ` ghost busters ' often say ` apparitions ' tend to drain their equipment ? 
  their batteries for example ? 
  it seems like he 's assuming ` ghosts ' could not be a closed system and would therefor vanish , but what if you introduce the element of replenishment in other ways than perpetual existence of a past state ? 
   `` and seeing as we 've made high precision measurements of the ways that particles interact , then my assertion is that there can be no such thing as an energy source that 's driving our bodies . '', 
  not an energy source , but energy . 
  the brain and nerves work by electrical discharges . 
  the energy source is metabolism . 
  this energy source is fed/maintained by our environment , what if ` apparitions ' would feed of the environment too , but instead of eat and drink , charge their energy . 
  guess we 'll have to wait what the upper house votes , the upper house wo n't change after the election in 3 weeks just to be clear . 
  not a politician , but falls in the same category as wilders . 
  or [ ayaan hirsi ali ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ayaan_hirsi_ali ) who following the murder on theo van gogh was housed on a royal marines base and eventually fled the netherlands to the us where she lives now . 
  i would be more concerned about the new rage of ` balloons ' , nitrogen cartridges injected in a balloon and inhaled until oxygen depraviation occurs and gives a euphoric feeling . 
  they 're at every party nowadays , even sold over the counter alongside a draft or coke . 
  brain damage is quite possible here . 
  for alcohol , just like many substances , it 's danger is in the way it is handled . 
  a beer or two wo n't be harmful if you keep it to a weekend night once in a while . 
  rutte 's party voted against . 
   in hindsight , the us should have exported the f-22 exclusively to nato allies and close allies like japan and australia . 
  i do n't think anybody has asked yet either . 
  the netherlands included the f-22 in a procurement investigation and would contemplate asking the us to export it if it would win . 
  but the f-35 was deemed more suitable . 
  he was not part of the ` inner circle ' so not in a position to pull anything of by himself , however from an information point of view he was in an even better position . 
  he knew what wilders would visit , what route he would take , what vulnerabilities there were etc. 
  apparently the suspects ' brother was also discharged from the police force due to leaking an murder investigation of abdel edoujaji to three friends , selling licenseplate information and raping a women whom he threatened he would lock up if she said anything . 
  indeed , and it 's then that instable regimes get the most dangerous . 
  not all of them . 
  there 's 89 votes in favour , vvd , pvda and d66 would make 87 . 
  it 's good that cda opposed , still gives a chance it wo n't pass the senate . 
  precise vote accounts are not yet available , but they 'll appear [ here ] ( https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/stemmingsuitslagen/detail?id=2017p02791 ) for those who find it important for the coming election . 
  i know , but executivemonkey is n't being serious . 
  check his post history . 
   that 's obviously not true even if you pretend that your ancestors being from europe makes you european you can just identify as european . 
  people should n't be oppressed by material limitations to identity like gender , or heritage . 
   and even if you then pretend that everyone in the us has european ancestry ( when you denote heritage in 1/32s and 1/64th they pretty much do . 
   extends no futher then repeating his own rather naive opinion over and over in one boring op-ed after another . 
  so he 's a journalist . 
   stop trying to police my country and stop trying to implement degenerate liberalism everywhere , it would help if the candidate membership status is rescinded . 
  a healthy distance between us gives more room for tolerance . 
  right now turkey pretends it wants to associate itself with europe , while it really does n't . 
  ` troll ' has a pretty negative connotation . 
  i think he 's often pretty funny . 
  that 's why you 'll proclaim neutrality while amassing your forces and mobilizing the reserves . 
  you 're not going to risk assets in estonia when you could be next . 
  who 's footstool are you ? 
  if anyone has delusions of grandeur it 's the federalists . 
  they after all want to be ` relevant ' , challenge china and the us and what not . 
  ` populists ' just want normal lifes . 
  normal people do n't care about being ` relevant ' . 
  you ca n't see their lizardry paws on the ballots , but they 're there . 
  that depends on how many ` former allies ' would in fact be open to total war . 
  finland , switzerland , austria and sweden would be the first to reassert their neutrality . 
  i have a feeling the germans might not be too inclined after that . 
  in this case it is in fact a choice for germany . 
  an invasion of estonia and latvia will take 24 maybe 48 hours . 
  long before nato can arrange a response . 
  at that point it will be a hard choice , attack russia and initiate total war , or back down and dig in . 
  that is in fact very much a choice . 
  in what way ? 
  in the case of baltics ` react ' will mean a counteroffensive , an active all-out attack on russian military positions . 
  i very much doubt it , she 's weak and frail . 
  certainly no tatcher material . 
  and that 's the political component , the defense itself will present a whole other component . 
  they will not support it if they 're heavily underequiped . 
  not much i suppose . 
  i doubt germany would go all-out total war if russia were to push boundaries , say start an insurgency or something . 
  i also doubt russia wants to do that . 
   i do n't get that . 
  you are part of nato and if russia attacks estonia you are at war . 
  nato is just a treaty . 
  physics are n't stopping you from ending it . 
  wether they would be at war or not is a question for the german government . 
  kosovo can not join because not all eu members recognize it as a state . 
  without that you ca n't approve an application .

   greeks have mobile missile artillery ( 122 mm grad rm70 ) - dutch have nothing of that kind .

  now let 's look at [ this ] ( http://archief.wereldomroep.nl/data/files/imagecache/must_carry/images/lead/article/2011/04/08ai6667.jpg ) , or [ this ] ( http://marineschepen.nl/schepen/images/e956cd1kl.jpg ) , or [ this ] ( https://www.defensie.nl/binaries/large/content/gallery/defensie/content-afbeeldingen/actueel/nieuws/2010/03/het-amfibisch-transportschip-hr-ms-johan-de-witt-in-actie-voor-de-noorse-kust-tijdens-de-internationale-oefening-cold.jpg ) , or [ this ] ( https://www.defensie.nl/binaries/large/content/gallery/defensie/content-afbeeldingen/organisatie/marine/schepen/de-zeven-provincien/d160122da005.jpg ) greece has nothing of the kind and this kind of material is outrageously expensive . 
  countries like greece , israel and finland get a lot more ` bang for their buck ' because they do n't have professional armies .
