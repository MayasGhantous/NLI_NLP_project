  the other one i have no idea what it is , it 's almost identical in shape to the picture i linked ( also the same material ) , but one side looks to be crafted to fit in the hand quite nicely . 
  that said i 'm no archeologist and it could be a lot more recent , but it was pretty cool none the less . 
   and the imf has no reason to play european political games . 
  they are already were and are . 
  that said , without imf there will indeed not be a bail-out . 
  it 's a lake since the dike . 
  your government is an islamofascist state , not comparable to the developed world . 
  yes but leeuwarden is stil 160km 's from utrecht . 
  it sounded like you were surprised it showed up on the signs . 
  also i was kidding , friesland has its own language ( frisian ) and in frisian it 's ljouwert . 
  ( hence the dual name signs ) . 
  leeuwarden/ljouwert is the capital of friesland . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.omropfryslan.nl/data/files/imagenodes/ljouwert%20bord.jpg ) the reason you see it on the destination signs is because it 's the second biggest city in northern netherlands . 
  so if you 're heading north , follow ljouwert . 
  it 's cheap , does n't take a lot of room , and often you have a front and back yard as well as a parking space . 
  it 's significantly better than an apartment . 
  regretfuly , most of them are the 1950s and 1960s variants though . 
  resources count for something , but if you live in a country ten times the size of germany with the same total population of the netherlands you 're not going to be a powerhouse . 
  especially not when your neighbours are n't any different . 
  would n't make it any less of a nice place though . 
  there 's some history , they found evidence of settlements dating back to 4300 bc in swifterband when the sea was a lot lower . 
  they even found 6300 year old graves and skelletons . 
  and of course ( a lot newer naturally ) some ships . 
  but yea , apart from urk everything is brand new . 
  ` terraced house ' , we call them ` rijtjeshuis ' ( literally translated as row house ) , and they can be quite nice . 
  the concept started in the netherlands due to a population boom and limited space . 
  [ this ] ( http://cdn.makeover.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rijtjeshuis-2-nrcreader.jpg ) for example , the 1950s-1960s are the [ ugliest variants ] ( http://images0.tcdn.nl/dft/geld/huis-hypotheek/article26197876.ece/binary/u/jtjeshuizen_met_oranje_daken.jpg ) they needed to be stamped out of the ground quickly following ww2 and the babyboom , a more modern one [ is this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1a/92/af/1a92af245081493d19efd541fd34b6ec.jpg ) . 
  40 % of our citizens live in a terraced house . 
  [ this is a picture ] ( http://almere.serc.nl/uploads/pics/08179luchtfoto_van_een_nog_onbebouwd_almere_haven_in_de_droogvallende_polder..jpg ) of almere from the 1970s . 
  what 's wrong with row houses ? 
  is there anything more [ beautiful than this ? 
  ] ( http://wallstars.nl/upload/photos/crop_0385771001372073578.jpg ) , or [ this ? 
  ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/elzendaalarchitectuur/images/0/0b/grachtenpanden.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140618075244 ), 
  that 's disappointing . 
  a dutch journalist recently befell the same fate , luckily our government managed to get her on a quick plane home . 
  but she ca n't visit turkey again probably . 
  hope the germans can get him home as well . 
  he 's a war criminal that should 've been trialed in the hague and put behind bars in scheveningen if we would impose the same standards to our own as we did to africans . 
  politics is n't , realpolitik is . 
   is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors , rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises . 
  in this respect , it shares aspects of its philosophical approach with those of realism and pragmatism . 
  it is often simply referred to as pragmatism in politics , e.g. 
  `` pursuing pragmatic policies '' ( singapore ) . 
  the term realpolitik is sometimes used pejoratively to imply politics that are coercive , amoral , or machiavellian . 
  they look like nice places for some military target practice with live ammunition . 
  and these officers would then move mountains to fight for him no doubt . 
   no , but it does look like this . 
  are n't most native americans ` integrated ' ? 
  we 're talking about 1/32nd , 1/64th or even 1/128th part ancestry here , odds are even most native americans had some european relative somewhere in the last centuries . 
  are there americans without european ancestry ? 
   you realize that miss. 
  was not a good example because it is part of the contiguous united states ? 
  ceuta is only 20km 's from spain . 
  hardly comparable to 4000 . 
   i know spain wants to keep these enclaves as of now , but if it became untenable/undesirable for spain to continue ruling these enclaves , you are saying they should remain as part of spain on the basis of self-determination ? 
  that will be something to consider then * if * that would be the case . 
  but yes , self-determination is the basis . 
   if the worst case migration scenario comes to pass due to climate change in the future , it could be an issue . 
  by that time the us will have a new president , and spain could always elect trump to make their wall 10ft higher . 
  does milton kenyes look like [ this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_i9fxsxyny0/uy5m7yv_xwi/aaaaaaaab7q/ka8rcd0r4g8/s1600/koolhaas-rem-almere.jpg ) though ? 
  or [ this ] ( https://9257a7265f7b40ffa2087b1664f26981.objectstore.eu/bedrijfspanden/c/huur/kantoor/1128/almere-veluwezoom-32-1327ah.jpeg ) ? 
  i do n't know , having to house 400.000 + people somewhere else might have cost us more pretty space . 
  small , but still communist . 
  not bad . 
  unfortunately they 're often forgotten about or not known . 
  sure we do n't spend our 2 % , but if there 's need of aid we 're there . 
  it 's not a one-way street as it is some times portrayed . 
  you realize hawai is 4000 km away from the us ? 
  going 4000km from ceuta you would end up east of moscow . 
  point is real politics are a thing of the past , regions are n't part of a country because they ` have use ' , they 're part of countries because that 's the way they historically ended up being . 
  and the question wether they should remain being is one of self determination , not of ` having use ' . 
  ceuta and melila are spanish , have been spanish for 500 or so years , do n't get started on the ` give it to morocco because my google maps says it is better that way ' . 
  is mississippi of any actual use to the us ? 
  did morroco pay you for the wall though ? 
  greece would probably be a better option that spain or italy . 
  there would be financial capital available , but it will lead to a period of hyperinflation . 
  you will impose capital restrictions , and your new currency will be backed by savings , pensions and foreign income of your citizens in a foreign currency ( dollar/euro/remimbi / swiss franc/pound ) and whatever remains of greek assets ( gold bullion , accessible financial assets ) you would essentially return to a short period of semi-autarky , where the limited financial capital that has worth overseas will be diverted to the bare essentials needed that can not be acquired otherwise . 
  ( oil most prominently ) this is a possiblity of course , do n't mistake me for advocating it as the way to go . 
  good , did you make any progress on dissecting the wivd law yet ? 
  i do n't know about the specific differences between both sides on ip protection . 
  sure it is two-sided , but from what i gathered the eu is more willing to compromise than vice versa . 
  i may be biased though . 
  i 'm sorry you feel that way , but i must warn you that if you ca n't put together a coherent argument nor have much in the way of social manners you 'll have this unpleasantry of being wrong quite often , regardless how convinced you are that you 're right if you ca n't put it to words you may as well be wrong . 
  the turkish province of cyprus has a land border with the republic of cyprus , so it is n't really an island . 
  the coj ruling did not apply to this law . 
  let 's not waste any more time here , you know what to do , good luck . 
  you ca n't actually proof it is illegal can you ? 
  you see , for a law to be illegal you would first have to quote the law or relevant sections of it , followed by the law or sections of it that it would be in violation of . 
  i respect that you do n't know a lot about how laws work , or discussions , or arguments , but i ca n't see how i could make that any more clearer than i already did to your friend . 
  i could try chinese , but my mandarin is a bit rusty . 
  so if you 're saying the law is illegal , which i do n't know it is and frankly i do n't even care for this conversation , you quote me the wivd-law sections that are illegal and the laws/sections that render it illegal . 
  good luck , i 'll be happy to recieve your answer . 
   thanks !, 
  looking at the picture i can sort of imagine where the lake would 've been , but the town itself looks completely planned and sort of artificial , especially the linear housing & the trees . 
  that 's because everything in this picture was a sea 85 years ago . 
  you 're looking at the largest artificial island ever created . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.docukit.nl/portals/0/inhoud/zuiderzeemuseum_p6.jpg ) a comparison between then and now , almere is south-west of lelystad in the corner of that green spot . 
  all the green area 's are new land . 
  you are indeed . 
  [ here 's the proposed law ] ( https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2016/10/28/voorstel-van-wet-inzake-wijziging-wet-op-de-inlichtingen-en-veiligheidsdienten ) as of oktober 2016 , now get going , show us the illegal parts .
