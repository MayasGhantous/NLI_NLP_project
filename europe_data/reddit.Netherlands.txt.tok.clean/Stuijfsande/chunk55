  is n't that exactly what she 's saying here ? 
   but what about the eu and euro ? 
  that 's insane . 
  britain just voted to leave the eu , and ` leaving the euro ' has been a subject of debate in multiple countries for some time . 
  i do n't see how that is insane , unwise perhaps , but ` insane ' sounds way over the top . 
  it 's just a common currency framework , and de facto not much more than a fixed exchange rate with some banking rules , and some fiscal rules nobody adheres to . 
  eu membership is n't everything either , neither norway or switserland are part of the eu , and they 're not exactly smuldering post-war ruines with bedouins scavenging about . 
  eastern europe needs nato . 
  de gaulle did the same during the height of the cold war . 
  they still live . 
  yes , lots of tax holes in the ground . 
  the big pros are for the baltics probably . 
  for finland and sweden i ca n't think of any pros . 
  the british and dutch retain expeditionary capabilities because we have islands a lot of miles away with beligerent neighbours . 
  ( argentina , venezuela ) finland and sweden are neutral countries , we 're often involved in international missions . 
  i ca n't think of any reason to include the nordics except for the capability of launching a counteroffensive on the baltics . 
  between the nordics , denmark is the only country with expeditionary capabilities . 
  they want government to resign . 
  clever one would be for algeria to send a couple of thousand soldiers without documents to france in migrant boats and send a covert ship or two full of arms a year later . 
  they would n't know what hit them . 
  no that 's frisian , and it 's a different language . 
  it 's said frisian is so similar to old english that if you would have a time machine and go back 1200 years you could communicate quite fine in england . 
  no they do n't , no defeat device has been found so far . 
  check the recent articles from the us . 
  anything after ` do you even ' is generally not a very strong argument . 
  you 're going to need more than deflection if you want to say something . 
  appoint prince as president of the liechtenstein regierungsrat until his death . 
  problem solved ? 
  one example is n't really a trend though is it . 
  what exactly in the saam system was blocking the americans ? 
  the radar system used on the type 45 is a modified version of the dutch smart-l . 
   they are the best aa-ships in the world , they are meant to make themselves a target . 
  i do n't know about that , they have a modified radar suite of the thales netherlands ( smart-l ) of the zevenprovinci\u00ebn , but these will get an upgrade soon too . 
  the type 45 are a tad larger , but other than that not more capable in combat than his majesty 's zevenprovinci\u00ebn class . 
  ` dank je ' literally means thank ( dank ) you ( je ) . 
  it 's two words . 
  it 's rather incorrect as well , ` bedankt ' ( thanks ) is more accurate . 
  ` dank je ' is more personal , ` dank u ' formal . 
  ` bedankt ' can be used informally too . 
  or they have a new kaiser standing in line . 
  belarus is in a personal union with russia , the goal has been to merge russia and belarus . 
  that 's why they systematically eradicated the language and severed ties with the west . 
  the only reason belarus is still independent is because lukashenko likes his job . 
  if he is incapacitated from his function in whatever way i doubt it will take long for the state to either be physically merged with russia or have another puppet ascend to the throne . 
  a moat without a wall is like having a golden shower while wearing a rain coat . 
  it 's just not the real thing . 
  that 's a little over half of western europe , is n't that what you have now too ? 
  make switzerland great again obviously . 
  what 's the point of having a neighbour too small to afford a wall . 
  and all these things will involve nagging at his own powerbase . 
  unlikely , lukashenko has no interest in the west , he 's only occasionally kicking and screaming to russia because if he does n't watch it belarus will be swallowed up whole by the russian federation . 
  can they invade first , and then hold a referendum ? 
   my troll detector needs a polish . 
  i assume it keeps ringing whenever you type , do n't worry , it 's working just fine . 
  closer ties to the eu are only possible if lukashenko resigns . 
  the eu has imposed sanctions on belarus for being a dictatorship . 
   russia might lose another piece in their sphere of influence . 
  or lukashenko might lose his skin as his coffee tastes funny one day . 
  no petrol engine whatsoever probably complies to cat5 standards for all we know . 
  norms are useless if you do n't enforce them , the us at least does enforce them . 
  could n't they have annexed it ? 
  emission norms . 
  for all intends and purposes they 're indeed ` not rules ' in europe . 
  consumer protection is quite good i suppose . 
  the rules are not applied in europe , that much is clear . 
  flemish is not a language , it 's called dutch . 
  alright , then the us has less strict rules on co2 ( although i prefer strict ones on nox , co2 is not directly harmful to me unlike nox ) thing is , europe may have rules , they 're not applied . 
  so even though on paper us co2 caps are higher , they 're stricter than the eu because they 're applied , and in the eu you can do what you like as long as you make something to limit the emissions when they 're in the labratory . 
   conversely gasoline/petrol/benzin emission regulations are stricter in the eu than in the usa . 
  you sure about that ? 
  any source ? 
  pretty sure the us is stricter , at least in actually enforcing them . 
   accusations that volkswagen rigged its diesel cars to cheat u.s. emissions inspections are prompting calls for the eu to toughen up its own auto standards and testing procedures , which lag behind those of the americans and are easier to circumvent . 
   `` the eu test is not fit for purpose , '' said greg archer , clean vehicle manager at the ngo transport & environment ( t&e ) . 
  `` europe needs to end the system where car makers can effectively shop around different countries for approval . '' [ 1 ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/volkswagen-emissions-nox-eu-us-epa-test/ ) ------  the main ingredient of smog -- from diesel cars ** to 80 milligrams per kilometer , up from 180 milligrams ** under the euro 5 rules . 
  nitrogen oxides ** in the u.s. are capped at 60 milligrams ** per kilometer . 
  the us is stricter in emissions as well , at least in terms of nox . 
  i do n't think we have fraud laws either , only specific ones . 
  i think fraud laws are something primarily anglo-saxon . 
  there 's no proof that all manufacturers do it . 
  for now it 's a myth germans say to feel better about themselves . 
  fiat is under investigation , but so far no defeat device has been found . 
  regardless wether others do it or do not do it , emission testing in europe is currently useless . 
  so that 's a thing that needs to change . 
  the swiss boil cheese , they need spoons not slicers . 
  barbarians . 
   tiny apartments but feel the need to have a bath in there , taking up much needed space  that 's something of old apartments , you 'll like the reasoning behind it . 
  post-war generations would draw a bath and then everybody would in turn use the bath . 
  usually parents first , then oldest child and so on . 
  cheaper than 6/7 showers . 
  also you 've probably been in a big cities , apartments outside the randstad are way too big and there ` sa shortage of small ones . 
  ( 3-4 bedrooms is standard , hard to find anything smaller )  they 're probably aware of it , but the lengthy goodbyes where everyone says bye to everyone else including some number of predetermined kisses while the foreigner has no clue what 's going on 3 kisses for a woman , a handshake for a male . 
   the level of head on your beers . 
  i 've grown to be okay with it because your glasses are sized appropriately , but the reasoning is questionable in my opinion two fingers of head on your beer if you 've a good bartender . 
   your cheese slicers . 
  why the fuck is that not popular in north america ? 
  they 're amazing . 
  i mostly take my cheese slicer with me when on a holiday . 
  i presume people in many countries do n't eat cheese , but i 've no other reason why people would be screwing a good cheese with a knife so you can spread 2 sandwhiches and buy a new cheese . 
  i bet that coffee is n't going to stay hot for a long time .
