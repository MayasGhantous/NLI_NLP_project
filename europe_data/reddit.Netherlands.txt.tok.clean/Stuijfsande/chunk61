  she does not need * additional * security to visit any place . 
  she has security , that was not enough for the refugee camp , so she needs additional . 
   so you 're saying that buma and roemer are not at all protected ? 
  indeed . 
   better call up buma and tell him to stop going to the house of representatives since obviously there 's absolutely no security ... that protection is not for them , but for the house of representatives . 
  it will be there wether they attend or not , it will be there if they get a new job . 
  a prison requires protection too , that does n't make the warden a protected man . 
   it 's a public appearance , it requires protection , and the fact is they were not prepared at all since there was no former warning she was coming at all , so obviously , for security reasons , she 'd have to be refused . 
  because she needs additional security to visit the place . 
  she never worked to have enemies , some people just consider those with different views and opinions as enemies . 
  they are the problem . 
  it does not , but the article does n't mention any racist remarks unlike what the title suggests . 
   and yes , all politicians need extra protection , that is just not true . 
  sybrand van haersma buma does n't need protection , nor does emile roemer . 
   look at , for example , the bundestag , where a lot of politicians are present and so are a lot of regular people visiting , it 's very highly secure because those people sitting there are a constant target no matter who they are . 
  which is a completely different situation then securing someones home or supermarket . 
   i said additional for lepen no you said additional for all politicians all the time . 
   i said that politicians ** need extra protection all the time ** , and that 's a common fact for not only lepen but for ** any politician ** at all . 
   i said that politicians need extra protection all the time , no they do n't . 
  only some do . 
   and that 's a common fact for not only lepen but for any politician at all . 
  it is n't . 
   if they were not ready to secure her fully , because as a politician in a public appearance i 'd imagine she 'd definitely need to be secure , then i believe it was a good call to refuse her entry to begin with . 
  the need for her to have additional security around there proves what people already expected . 
  it is an important message to the electorate . 
  i would permit entry to a politician . 
  i would even welcome it , it 's important politicians see what they talk about in a posh room in paris . 
  [ video can be seen here ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/african-migrant-drowns-venice-grand-9694743 ) ( warning , could be shocking ) seems like a suicide , he does appear to be able to swim and the life ring was right in front of him . 
   security is needed for most events where people of two political camps gather in one place . 
  are refugees people of a political camp ? 
   marine le pen is a highly prominent icon of anti-migrant and anti-refugee policies . 
  she could spark high tensions not only with inhabitants of the camp , but with the people employed there as well . 
  be that as it may , if her politics are a reason she would not be safe in a refugee camp then i find that a very concerning situation that needs to change . 
  talk , draw , sing all you want , violence is where we draw a line . 
   high profile strangers , no . 
  the fact that you 're blatantly ignoring this part makes the continuation of this discussion useless . 
   i 'm not ignoring anything , just observing that these camps are apparently not save enough for a politician to walk in , which is a very bad situation and not what a ` refugee camp ' should be . 
   again , it 's not a zoo . 
  why would a stranger come unannounced into a facility they are not a part of ? 
  what 's your obsession with this ` zoo ' ? 
  there 's no reason to dehumanize anyone here , she 's a representative of french people , she 's involved in making and evaluating policy , it should be natural that she sees what exactly she is making/judging policy about . 
   i believe it 's about the option to deny entry for security reasons . 
  why would you deny entry for security reasons ? 
   erm i 'm not sure which kind of authority states that all refugees are doctors and engineers . 
  none , you should reread the sentence . 
   ahh `` people 's judgement '' and unchecked manipulative press , all i see coming out of that is witch hunts and poor decisions . 
  that 's what * you * see , and that 's why * you * want to suppress them . 
  you see the real motivation behind what you root for is far darker than you yourself realize . 
  you have n't yet , you only expanded on the tool you 're going to use for it . 
  there 's no other reason to talk about fake news then the inability to face opposing arguments otherwise . 
  europe has been pumping out fake news for years and nobody talked about it . 
  i can only assume the worst that people are now suddenly interested in banning it when other parties use these very same tactics . 
  it 's a tool for silencing dissent which you can not cope with . 
  and that 's not how civilized societies treat discourse . 
   she 's a high profile person , refugee camps are not zoos and are not equipped to let strangers ( non refugees or staff ) roam around with no notice beforehand . 
  so you 're saying the camps are n't safe for strangers . 
  that 's not a very good signal . 
  but not relevant , it 's neither of the eu nor is it a university . 
   imo these are nice but empty words : every single platform that allows users to interact with each other does some level of thought policing , by allowing certain content to have more or less visibility based on various criteria . 
  as provably false information can be labeled , i believe there should be a penalization system . 
   also , and more importantly , unchecked fake news can be used as a tool of censorship : just spam alternative theories that sound more or less plausible and you can suppress actual ( or even fake , but opposing ) information without enacting direct censorship . 
  that might make sense to you in a utopian world , but in a real world nobody can be trusted to determine what is and is n't fake , because fake is what does not conform to your personal opinion , and real is what feels real enough to you . 
  the ` refugees are doctors and engineers ' is as much fake news as the ` maidan was western coup ' , yet no authority can be trusted to label both as such . 
  it will be either or depending on who is the judge . 
  hence determining what is fake and not will be up to the people themselves and should be up to nobody else , these practices can remain in the 1940s for all i care . 
  they have pretty much all the things the modern western tanks have . 
  they 're very much comparable . 
  it 's not the t90 's that are the problem , they still have vast amounts of t-72 's and even older in service which are getting dated and inneffective in modern warfare . 
  though they 're being modernized recently . 
   however , i question the whole 2 % thing . 
  especially for small countries with high gdp as luxembourg there are less cost-effective things to invest in , cooperation on benelux level could be possible . 
  for example the netherlands bought 4 ocean going patrol boats for a total of 500 million euro . 
  could 've made 6 and sold 2 to luxemburg for you to use , parking training and equiping can be done in the dutch port just like the belgians do . 
  you have the scale with us . 
  you do n't have a coast , but it 's more of flag showing thing . 
  you can send a ship to somalia to combat pirates with the eu mission , you can send a ship to italy to help manage the migrant crisis etc. 
  that 's reasonably very much possible with luxemburgs budgets . 
  increased cooperation with belgium and the netherlands would also be a good thing . 
  same for airunits , could have procured some nh90 's with us to use on these patrol boats . 
  i get it you guys do n't have the scale , but together with the netherlands and/or belgium you do . 
  no doubt it will give you some influence and prestige internationally but it also keeps relations warm , which will no doubt be paid back . 
   in addition some of the countries that spend a lot on their military are not doing so to defend themselves ( or their allies ) against a foreign attack , but to conduct military operations in other countries and project power . 
  which is entirely their prerogative and likely a good thing overall . 
  nevertheless trump can shut it , if he argues that the us are spending all this money on their military to protect the europeans and not to follow their own interests . 
  that 's true , but sometimes these ` power projection capabilities ' profit all . 
  for example when they 're used to defend commercial container ships off the coast of somalia , or when they intercept weapon transports in the caribbean . 
  he implied it . 
  if the present security is not sufficient you need additional ? 
  so they 're saying these camps are n't safe and require additional security to visit ? 
  that is n't making matters better is it . 
   it 's usually impossible to get a nation to recognize historical mistakes or lies . 
  not for us . 
  it 's been done before , can be done again . 
   the size of the russian economy in comparison to the eu guarantees that libya would orientate more towards the eu if they were given a free choice . 
  the only way to guarantee any form of more than cordial relationship between russia and libya would be some form of dictatorship and from our point of view i think we would rather see the state split than accepting that . 
  it would be free to do so . 
  it 's just not going to be forced to shun russia like iraq was . 
  the article does n't even state ` fake ' for good reason , but rather ` thoughts and feelings ' . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://wetten.overheid.nl/bwbr0001840/2008-07-15 ) other states can turn into nice fascist top-down structures controlling populations and thought , not us . 
   ( ie social networks and search engines should be forced to do some policing on their own , we 're often not talking about traditional press ) no one should be forced to perform thought policing .
