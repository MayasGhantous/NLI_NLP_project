  in the netherlands elderly are increasingly familiar with the digital world . 
  also dutch municipalities provide free computer courses if they 're not yet . 
  socialist party in the netherlands does the same , members earn 2500 euro net per month , the rest is given to the party . 
  ( which is also a charity ), 
   oh and the ireland 's gdp growth is simply mindblowing , can someone explain how they did it ? 
  with a clerk and post man employed by apple you suddenly add billions to your gdp . 
   whats up with the finland and dutch ranking fight lately ? 
  :p finns ca n't take it we narrowly beat them each time in rankings . 
  most of societies ` brain power ' is sub millionair . 
  so that ` brain drain ' is rather overrated . 
  i think a maximum earnings limit is a good idea ( and a necessary one soon , probably ) but there should still be a healthy difference between hard workers , smart workers , regular workers etc. 
  a cap at for example 800.000 eurp per year or something sounds good . 
  i do n't think anybody is worth more than that . 
  ( on the contrary , strictly looking at worth the more people earn over a million , the less they 're intrinsically worth ), 
  [ what a coincedence ] ( http://charting.vwdservices.com/tchart/tchartcached.aspx?user=mm-wisselkoers&amp;amp;format=image%2fgif&amp;amp;issue=190143785&amp;amp;width=558&amp;amp;height=200&amp;amp;enddate=today&amp;amp;startdate=3m&amp;amp;layout=simpleblued3&amp;amp;res=endofday ) , very odd . 
  could there be a relation ? 
  israel was basically an ex-british colony too from 1922 to 1947 . 
   ~ ~ europe ~ ~ ** german ** manufacturing relies a lot on the branding of its auto makers , so sink it , they gave as much considerations to the others and deserve equally as much in return . 
  sounds like paradise . 
  'cause of death ; cosmic radiation ', 
  far from perfect , but you guys are saints compared to europe . 
  you know that politicians in europe are n't just selected by banks , but that banks actually attend eu/eurozone confidential meetings * personally * ? 
  take that . 
  imagine mario draghi in a room , with deutschebank , ing group , credit agricole , hsbc etc. 
  plotting eurozone monetary policy together , having a laugh over the spanish , greek and italian unemployment rates . 
  the us is the only one that actually imprisoned some of their bankers . 
  in europe easter and pentecost would fall on the same day before any banker would ever be convicted . 
  the whole diesel car thing is one of the biggest conspiracies of the modern world , the lid has barely come of . 
  new diesel cars ( not just vw ) are actually more pollutant than whole cargo trucks and busses according to an investigation in progress . 
  according to the international council on clean transportation cargo trucks emit 210 milligram nox per km . 
  new euro-6 diesel personal cars emit 500 milligram nox per km . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4332/groen/article/detail/4444994/2017/01/06/nieuwe-dieselauto-s-veel-vervuilender-dan-moderne-trucks-en-bussen.dhtml ) so you can drive 2,5 cargo trucks for one personal vehicle on diesel of nox emission . 
  it 's maddening . 
  per liter diesel personal cars emit 10x as much as a cargo truck . 
  the vast majority of the interceptions is this indeed , a couple of them have been actual incursions though . 
  note that flying without transponders is n't illegal for a military to do , there are international behavioural rules that have to be followed in this case though , ensuring the military jet does not pose a threat to civilian airtraffic . 
  so they ca n't choose between a hard or soft no-exit . 
  how can norway leave when it never joined ? 
  well current healthcare in the netherlands is better than the collective system we come from . 
  so the privatization was an improvement ( for us ) . 
  but we had to come from pretty far , so pretty much any change would probably have been an improvement . 
   and we are both craft beer home brewers so trying different beers and breweries would be amazing . 
  obligatory visit to the brugge beer wall then . 
   we are really into art ( we own a gallery in tijuana mexico ) , if by art you mean paintings holland has some very nice ones in the museums . 
  ( as in the provinces of holland , so amsterdam and the vicinity ), 
  you mean like , a nexit ? 
  meanwhile belgian journalist abou jahjah is fired from the belgian newspaper ` de standaard ' for saying the attack was justified resistance against israeli occupation . 
  by bicycle . 
  it 's not that bad , but there is n't actually that much competition possible without infringing on universal healthcare . 
  initially this led to insurers hoarding massive amounts of money ( and i mean massive , multiple billions of euro 's per year were hoarded in funds , unused ) obviously we paid far too much for healthcare when it was privatized , and all the excess money was making some people very , very rich . 
  the government countered that by constantly adding more and more responsibilities from the state to the insurer , that forced them to cannabalize some of these excess reserves , but it is also still accompanied by an annual increase in both monthly costs and healthcare costs which is way above a normal rise . 
  ( 2016-2017 is about a ** 5 % ** increase , that 's way higher than inflation or wage increase ), 
  i 'm shocked . 
  poland did acquire some f-16 's lately . 
  and disregarding the origin , these mig-29 's are still pretty neat looking machines too . 
  the f-22 's are very rarily deployed outside the us . 
  you would need to be an odd snowflake to even consider following ` oriental and african studies ' . 
  a generation of welfare clients right there , keeping ` gender studies ' graduates company . 
  if you 're an aircraft spotter it 's a different story of course . 
  but what kind of exotic planes would they send ? 
  what they mainly use , is also mainly used in europe . 
  ( f-16 , f-18 , c-130 etc. ), 
  maybe a10 's , or f-15 's ? 
  because greece is n't going to deport people even if they could . 
  protection/conservation etc. 
  what i mean is that without protection/conservation , i hope people are responsible enough to not damage it . 
  transation ; ` since 2 o'clock heavy artileryfire , air alarm , fighter jets above torez ( closest village to mh17 ) many impacts ' [ 1 ] ( https://twitter.com/marijndt/status/493353769867177984 ) dutch reporter for state broadcaster nos on july 27th ;  nl team vandaag niet naar rampgebied ivm veiligheidsproblemen translation ; ` nl-team today not going to crash site due to security problems ' . 
  [ 2 ] ( https://twitter.com/djmoskou/status/493336791483961344 ) ukraine reporter on july 27th ;  ukrainian forces now heading to shakhtarsk ( then likely krasnyi luch ) to seize the last major #luhansk - #dontesk route [ 3 ] ( https://twitter.com/stateofukraine/status/493330781352521728 ) honestly fuck of with your paid posts . 
  the area was not directly shelled , but hit by stray fire from the nearby ukrainian offensive . 
  the point was that ukraine felt empowered with russia having its hands full with mh17 to take the area . 
  i do n't know how well your sight is . 
  it 's right under your nose if you had only read any of the replies you responded to . 
  more specifically , ukraine went on the offensive around the mh17 crash site , which made the area even more dangerous . 
  then you can wait a long time . 
  i see you choose to remain dishonest , decieving and ignorant , this conversation is over for you . 
  ukraine did not do everything to help the investigation , on the contrary , their military offensive close to the crash site greatly complicated and endangered the investigation . 
  if you want an honest conversation you 'll need to read first . 
  i 'm open to conversation , but not with your current ill-intended attitude . 
  ukrainian military operations to conquer the land around mh17 from the militia endangered dutch personnel , and forced them to postpone and occasionally evacuate the area , complicating the mission . 
  you can keep your sensitivities on the subject for some other discussion . 
  will the telegraph do for you ? 
   dutch military policemen have been forced to postpone their arrival on the malaysian airlines flight 17 disaster after fierce fighting between ukrainian and rebel forces broke out near the crash site on sunday . 
   clashes erupted around torez , 40 miles east of donetsk and the nearest town to the crash site , on sunday afternoon ** as government forces pressed on with an offensive designed to encircle donetsk . 
  ** [ 1 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10993931/fierce-fighting-in-ukraine-prevents-dutch-forces-reaching-mh17-crash-site.html ) it 's not exactly a state secret . 
  the many people that may have seen it before could 've thought the same and never made a mention of it . 
  italy has so much history it is just impossible to protect and sustain it all . 
  here 's hoping people will understand their importance and the need to protect them without government interference so that future generations can enjoy them as well . 
   of been standing there the picture of the article is n't from the find . 
  the site was probably hard to recognize as having any importance to an ` untrained ' eye . 
  ottoman empire , dumbest empire . 
  not necessarily great , just better . 
  it 's not an either or , there 's a whole lot of difference between plain poverty , and modern inquisition and repression by a 5th century death cult . 
   belarus is not called belarussia . 
   that was n't intentional , in dutch we say ` wit-rusland ' and ` rusland ' , kinda confusing translating it into english . 
   and not sure what a belarrusian dialect is . 
  belarusian is the name of the language . 
  is it really a language though ? 
  can a russian understand you if you speak belarussian ? 
  which is why i mentioned ` and the like ' . 
  did n't feel much for naming the rest of the islamic paradises like somalia , yemen , pakistan , afghanistan , mali what have you .
