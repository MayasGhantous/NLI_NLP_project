  unlike with for example romania and sweden where he used ppp , or netherlands malaysia , or uk/1/3th of india . 
  he just used all sorts of different numbers and pasted them all in a map . 
  you used ppp numbers and nominal numbers at random , the map is worth practically nothing for comparison . 
  pieken is what you have in the german/bavarian alps . 
  i 'm not suggesting that turkey is n't a balkan country , i 'm stating it . 
  turkey is asian , a very small part happens to be in europe . 
  piek not pieken , piek is already plural . 
  you 're welcome to borrow it . 
  for ` pietermannen ' you do need to use the - en . 
  so ' \u00e9\u00e9n pieterman ' ( ein pietermann ) , and ` tien pietermannen ' ( zehn pietermannen ), 
   by the way , how many migrants in luxembourg ? 
  very few non-eu ones , under the relocation scheme the migrants refused to go to luxemburg , most do n't even know the country exists and think it 's a ploy to lure them to a poor eastern country instead of germany or sweden . 
  the person was saying we should ` limit russia ' . 
  that is managing their relations yes . 
  yes and france is an african country with mayotte and reunion and all that for goodness sake . 
  we 're not all like / u/xnicolex in europe , sorry for that . 
  you people are perfectly able to pick your own friends and manage your own relations , there 's no role for us in that . 
  informally you can use ` pietermannen ' or ` piek ' . 
  i use that too sometimes , it 's from the gulden originally , but who cares . 
  what 's also used informally is ` een bankje ' ' a couch ' , meaning 100 euro ( or use to mean 100 gulden ) . 
  ' i sold that old car for 5 bankjes ' . 
  still works . 
  there were other words for example ` een geeltje ' ( a yellow-ish ) but that is n't used anymore ( refered to the colour of the 25 gulden biljet ), 
  due to a ship colliding with a dam in the netherlands the water in the meuse has been falling to record low levels , this has uncovered roman remnants of the foundations of a dock/pier . 
  archaeologists were aware the remnants were there , but they 've never been visible because the water has never been so low . 
  it 's a couple of oak wooden pillars that use to support a roman pier in cuijk ( romans called it ` ceuclum ' back then ) . 
  they 're not the first , previously some have been found and removed , they 're now displayed in a museum . 
  probably , it would be very complicated otherwise . 
  - register 1,4 million migrants . 
  - only recieve 100.000 actual people wir scherzen das, 
  it 's a difference in culture . 
  there 's little the belgian government does n't know about its citizens . 
  hell you do n't even need to fill in your tax application , the government already did that for you it only requires a check and digital signature . 
  there 's little potential for abuse , what exactly would you abuse it for ? 
  the information is not the problem , i would be more worried about the relationship between government and citizens with the way they handle the migration crisis . 
  trust comes on foot and leaves on horseback as they say . 
  holy iberian empire , it does have a ring to it . 
   what if we put it to a vote , but one country shuts it down because reasons . 
  then that country will not participate . 
   ideally you 'd have the vote be eu-wide , of course not . 
  foreigners do n't vote over our sovereignty . 
  what 's next , you 'll vote for our parliament too ? 
  what also matters is just not wanting a constitution . 
  we 're not a country , ergo we do n't have a common constitution . 
  high energy !, 
  he 's going to nuke moscow * and * make the russians pay for it . 
  germany is n't exactly russia 's front lawn . 
   peg podlich who was a tourist from arizona , not an afghan correct , because of her there 's quite some information and footage about how afghanistan was before the descent into islamic madness . 
  [ they would ] ( http://www.barnorama.com/wp-content/images/2013/01/afghanistan-1970s/10-afghanistan-1970s.jpg ) wear bikini 's too . 
  they 're not ` communist propaganda posters ' , neither are they only a ` fringe minority ' . 
  [ quite normal ] ( http://www.barnorama.com/wp-content/images/2013/01/afghanistan-1970s/21-afghanistan-1970s.jpg ) people were normal back then even in [ rural parts ] ( http://www.barnorama.com/wp-content/images/2013/01/afghanistan-1970s/11-afghanistan-1970s.jpg ) . 
  same with iran and others . 
  good call , people do n't seem to care that the constitution was turned down in a referendum by multiple countries , and could only really be ever adopted if put up for vote again and passed by all . 
  yes that it was . 
  do you think it 's a good idea to remind ourselves of that yearly over a century later ? 
  perhaps earn some money on it ? 
  blame people who were n't even alive back then but are from the same country ? 
  what is it you want from it exactly ? 
  do you want some moral masturbation ? 
  some virtue signaling ? 
  some ethical stimulation ? 
  or just a minute of facebook fame ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.knack.be/medias/2478/1268971.jpg ) is afghanistan in 1970 . 
  and [ this ] ( http://fakka.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/afghanistan36.jpg ) too as hard as it is to believe , looks familiar does n't it ? 
  tough job being a journalist in turkey these days . 
  the embargo was placed on all parties of the conflict . 
  i agree it was unfortunate for the bosnians , as they were the last on the independence train and after leaving a lot of heavy military equipment in croatia and slovenia the yna withdrew pretty much all equipment from bosnia and macedonia . 
  however you make it sound as if bosnia was singled out , it was n't . 
  for as far as being defenceless that 's hardly an argument , it 's not our job to make a war fair or anything . 
  slovenia , croatia , macedonia and bosnia declared independence of yugoslavia , it is only natural all the equipment went to serbia-montenegro because they were what was left of it . 
  in fact , they ** wanted ** the armed forces to leave . 
  what did you expect ? 
  the european community imposed an embargo on the entire yugoslavian state , including bosnia . 
  nothing special about it . 
  i take it your ` future christian europe ' is shite too . 
  your own ethics perhaps , and laws that the government otherwise happily breaks when it is to their benefit . 
  most of this spooning up and subsequent revisionism of historical events pulled out of context to moralize them based on 21st century values is in fact ridiculous , but people enjoy doing it , it 's not something new or out of the ordinary . 
   what is this going to accomplish anyways ? 
  international admission . 
  which could on its turn lead to a german apology and some kind of settlement for relatives . 
  it 's not even 2 million , that 's not a big amount in a country that has 47 million citizens , especially not when most of these 2 million are from a neighbour . 
   giving the uk muslim population in 2011 as ~ 2,706,066 , ~ 4.5 % of the total population . 
   islam is the second largest religion in belgium , accounting for 5 to 7 % of the total population  the french polling company ifop estimated in 2016 that french muslims number between 3 and 4 millions , and criticised suggestions of a fr : grand remplacement . 
  ifop claims that they make up 5.6 % of those older than 15 , and 10 % of those younger than 25 . 
  [ 15 ] spain has one of the smallest muslim populations in western europe , together with italy and portugal . 
  so relatively the smallest of them all , except for germany and italy . 
  that 's a mere 4 % , not a large population at all . 
  on the contrary , the distinction is very important . 
   bosnia still is largely secular , but is becoming less secular . 
  so we agree . 
  i 'm not saying bosnia is n't largely secular , i 'm saying it becoming less secular is a slippery slope . 
   islam is at war with itself in the east , not in bosnia . 
  islam is at war with itself wherever islam is . 
  it 's a battle between traditional nostalgic forces seeking comfort in an old life-encompassing ideology offering them an escape from their sad , poor existence in a rapidly changing world , and a post-modern irreligious equal and open world throwing their communities upside down . 
  bosnia fits the bill quite well , a poor , corrupt state , left outside a modern evolving world around it yet only a finger tap away , and a historically powerful religion which made up its own world not that long ago hibernating among its citizens . 
  i do n't see why you are immune to something that has succumb so many more people . 
   actually , as far as i understand , according to the common european asylum system , the eu ~ ~ can not ~ ~ * will not * simply send them back . 
  there 's of course no force of nature stopping the eu from sending them back . 
   we are a completely different story compared to muslims in the east . 
  we 're europeans .
