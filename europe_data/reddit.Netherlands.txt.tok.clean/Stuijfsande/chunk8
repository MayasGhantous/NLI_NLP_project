   ( i 'm assuming a combination of elder men pairing up with young women and more single mothers in the first scenario , leading to a faster recovery of the population ) that 's what many french women did after ww1 . 
  pick an old man , instead of remaining single . 
  ( which was n't as accepted as it is now ), 
  i 'm not sure the land will allow for a slightly higher level of development , the land and climate are n't that great ( which is why so few live there in the first place ) . 
  not to mention agriculture is the absolute base-line in terms of human development . 
  can confirm , it 's even in [ space ] ( http://www.proeurope.org/content/eu_flag_b_rosetta_eurologo1.jpg ) , in the [ sea ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/2c/f9/6b/2cf96b572c02bd098a3cc05d1f2f6919.jpg ) , and if that was n't remarkable enough , it 's in [ london ] ( https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/e0pswxg69dp1g2r.fxlmxw--/yxbwawq9aglnagxhbmrlcjtzbt0xo3c9nduwo2g9mjk3o2lspxbsyw5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/news/reuters/2017-02-27t202033z_1007000001_lynxmped1q1g2_rtroptp_2_cnews-us-britain-eu-major.jpg.cf.jpg ) of all places . 
   and since the territory is vast and covered with forest in a large part , it 's going to take time before it gets more `` useful '' . 
  perhaps one best not make it useful , and leave the forests there instead . 
  i did n't downvote you . 
  sorry i mixed up with the real guyana when googling for population . 
  as if a dead woman is worse than a dead man . 
  the guyanese * are * ethnically french , and yes , that would not make a difference . 
  it 's very hard to exploit any exotic activities in guyana because there 's nobody going to buy it from you there , there 's no chain of supply , there 's very little human capital . 
  the falklands have 2900 citizens . 
  in what way is that comparable to 800.000 citizens in a country twice the size of england ? 
  that 's because they 're tax paradises with 13 citizens . 
  the british do not have territory like guyana , the biggest british overseas territory is gibraltar with 30.000 citizens . 
  guyana has more people than all british territories combined and then 8 times . 
  the only european country with somewhat comparable overseas territories is the netherlands , and these territories are poorer than the mainland ( though among the richest in the region ), 
  so is greece , but they ca n't , and that is accepted . 
  even though every other country recognizes greek sovereignty . 
  of course they 're the poorest province of france , they 're in a poor region and barely have 800.000 citizens . 
  you ca n't really expect them to be a rich region . 
  they would be even poorer without france though . 
  french was the language of the elite at the time , and was much more important in the low-lands than it is today . 
  the majority of belgium spoke french at the time , and the french speaking area was the economic heart of belgium due to their reliance on trade with france . 
  but it slowly withered and dutch took it 's place , and french ceased to be the lingua franca . 
   how did the eu find its way to the headline ? 
  british press . 
  if denmark wanted to remove the gold it could do so . 
  they probably do n't want to , as denmark does n't have any substantial international financial center . 
  our gold is scattered too , 31 % amsterdam , 31 % new york , 18 % london and 20 % in ottowa . 
  that 's done due to the ease of transactions , selling , buying or leveraging gold is simply a matter of moving it from one fault to the next , instead of moving it over 100s , perhaps 1000s of miles . 
  i agree . 
  ` eendracht maakt macht ' sounds even better . 
  yes , denmark has 66,5 tons . 
  the netherlands recently moved 120 tons from the us to amsterdam , just in secret with a navy lpd . 
  by the time anyone talked about it the gold was halfway over the atlantic . 
  a lot of our gold was also stolen by germany in the 1940s , germany sold that gold to switzerland . 
  for decades the netherlands and switserland have been in a diplomatic conflict , the netherlands managed to force switzerland to reptriate a significant portion of the gold back to the netherlands , but in the 1990s we relinquished our last claims as it was getting irresponsible legally speaking . 
  i do n't believe i used the word ` german ' anywhere , i was quite specific with berlin . 
   the idea that the usa could prevent a nuclear launch by the uk or redirect the missiles is a conspiracy theory perpetuated by anti-nuclear campaigners . 
  there 's no technological basis . 
  the uk is n't even allowed to test-fire without the us navy , let alone actually fire one . 
  these missiles would be fancy barrels in expensive submerged metal cigars without prior us launch approval . 
   do you really think the uk has lost the technology to develop nuclear weapons since the 1950s ? 
  that depends how you define nuclear weapons . 
  can britain construct it 's own nuclear weapon ? 
  yes , but so can belgium . 
  britain can not construct a missile capable of delivering the weapon , and belgium ca n't either . 
  only the french have the capabilities for that . 
  so far all intends and purpose , yes the uk has lost that technology . 
  ( technology it never possesed , but the nature of the weaponsystems changed ), 
  we do actually , 612,5 tons of it . 
  more than the ecb and india , twice as much as the uk , though less than japan . 
  making it the 10th largest gold reserve in the world if you include the imf . 
  it was the motto of the house of orange-nassau , specifically it was from the house of orange , the prinsdom william of orange inherited from chalon . 
  the prinsdom orange was french ( in modern day provence ) . 
  pre-1815 the dutch national motto was ` eendracht maakt macht ' , the motto belgium copied following its independence . 
  by the transfer from a republic to a monarchy the motto of the house of orange-nassau was adopted as national motto in 1815 . 
  except they did n't u-turn , they just carried on their journey through gibraltar as they always do . 
  you did n't really think a 6m long raft would stop a 90m former corvet right ? 
  the spanish front gun was larger than the rn 's vessel . 
  there 's no difference between civilians and military deaths when there 's conscription . 
  is the e.u. 
  ripping off your pets ? 
  and uncalled for . 
  [ there has been ] ( https://images3.persgroep.net/rcs/vpu6hbkoa7dqt6feppbwpr2d0vq/diocontent/102298434/_fitwidth/694/?appid=21791a8992982cd8da851550a453bd7f&amp;quality=0.9 ) a how of solidarity today in rotterdam . 
  perhaps they 'll light up the dom tonight , i do n't know , but the victimisation is uncalled for , we mourn the innocent deaths of st petersburg like we did with the previous . 
  berlin does n't , but some of us do , and less attention should be given to berlin , and more to those that do . 
  none , but we 're better than that . 
  france lost a total of 1.400.000 people in ww1 , compared to a total of 600.000 in ww2 . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_i_casualties#casualties_by_1914.e2.80.9318_borders ) [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties#human_losses_by_country ) not to mention the physical devastation of ww1 was much greater . 
  ww1 was a lot harsher than ww2 for the french . 
  fire caused most of the damage in rotterdam as well , fire caused by bombs . 
  but middelburg was bombed by the germans , shelled by the french , and at the end bombed by the british/canadians . 
  so it saw quite some devastation . 
   i guess its also why i like leiden , utrecht and groningen . 
  dordrecht is nice as well . 
  they probably did n't want them to go to amsterdam or dublin but to paris or frankfurt . 
  just joking , i 'm not a big city person either . 
  i regularly come in amsterdam , but am always relieved to view it in the rear mirror . 
  middelburg is a nice city , even though it was together with rotterdam the city 's that were bombed there 's still a lot of history and charm there . 
  they do n't want to go to amsterdam because of the dutch laws limiting their bonus . 
  the dutch government also did n't particularly want them because they found it childish to try and turn the uk a leg off . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that , my condolences . 
  yes , readers/viewers might think the author was banging his head against the keyboard when attempting to write the finnish motto . 
  if they do n't ` combat ' ` taxes ' with the prosecutor office they have now they wo n't do it with a new one either . 
  that 's the motto of the dutch province of zeeland . 
  turkey fired the first shot in the imia conflict with greece downing a helicopter killing 3 crew members in 1996 , they were n't screwed . 
  from their point of view they 're not doing any incursions . 
  as far as they 're concerned it 's their waters , and they use them often . 
   he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that bailout countries misspent their money on `` alcohol and women '' before asking for financial support . 
  he did n't say that at all , but the media has a bad relation with the truth . 
   his refusal to apologise initially provoked a wave of condemnation and calls for his resignation . 
  no wonder , one does not apologize for things one did not say . 
  the translation of je maintaindrai ( ik zal handhaven ) in this context is n't really accurate . 
  it 's more like ' i will persevere ' or ' i will uphold ' , even ' i will enforce ' . 
  i do n't know , it 's significantly less than previous attacks of this magnitude . 
  rotterdam , antwerpen and dresden are the only ones i can find .
