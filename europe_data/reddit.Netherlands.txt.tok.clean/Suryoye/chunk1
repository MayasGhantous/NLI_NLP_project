we 're way too small to go through on our own . 
  leaving the eu would screw us so much more than people think . 
  i absolutely love that stuff , so delicious . 
  we call it akoodeh ,, 
  care to explain the second ? 
  did n't know the netherlands ` dislikes ' turkey . 
  i did n't know we still had f-16s , considering the military budget cuts ... 
  turkey can not into europe . 
  the 2 big isp 's do n't have any direct competition in the netherlands . 
  there 's only competition on the fiberglass cabels but there are little people who have fiber . 
  i see . 
  i remember the old yellow gvb trams in amsterdam used to have ads on the outside . 
  now it 's just limited to the few tv 's on the inside . 
  not sure if the gvb buses used to have ads on the outside . 
  which city ? 
  i ca n't remember seeing any advertisement in the buses in amsterdam . 
  or i may be blind . 
  i think the design got tweaked a little bit for all newer pressed euros . 
  the newer looking euros in my wallet have europe on the front and the older euros only have the members of the eu . 
  nah it is n't that bad , depending on where in amsterdam you live . 
  i 'm fairly positive and ca n't really complain . 
  no , you do n't want to live in amsterdam . 
  source : i live in amsterdam . 
  every piece of land that is n't inhabited or a road , is a farm . 
  that and a combination of a mild climate with fertile land . 
  i thought french was so much easier than german , and that 's coming from a dutch . 
  i hated german grammar rules . 
  french has hard pronunciation , but its grammar is simpler imo . 
  yeah we 're pretty impressive for a country this small . 
  we 're the worlds third largest exporter of agriculture good after the united states and france . 
  can you imagine ? 
  that little spot on earth with a really high population density , manages to come third . 
  because dutch like to complain . 
  did his reaction involve something with ` kanker ' ? 
  we also refer to it as holandija in aramaic , arabic too iirc . 
  what an interesting bot . 
  as far as i know , most people just call it holland here ( north-holland at least ) . 
  it 's actually reddit where i found out some people got kinda angry when the netherlands got referred to as holland . 
  1830 never forget . 
  holland ! = the netherlands ( well in some languages it is ) . 
  holland refers to the region which consists of the provinces [ north - and south-holland . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/holland_position.svg ) but then again , some people do n't care about how you call it , others can get butthurt . 
  hmm interesting , the blue parts ( and partially green parts ) seem to be kinda correlating with [ the blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ), 
  ehh for the netherlands i can say we greatly benefit from the eu because our trade position and leaving it would be stupid . 
  yes , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/trhdy0i.jpg ) is the new fashion here . 
  yeah the amount of people already there scared me away so ill never go through that street again unless i have to take the tram . 
  now you have , 
  shhhh ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ tell ^ ^ them, 
  not only tourists , in the ghetto where i live , locals frequently walk on the cycle paths like they have no idea it 's meant for bicycles . 
  which i find more rage inducing since they live here and should fucking know a bicycle path is only for fucking bicycles . 
  oh yes , i live in amsterdam and made the mistake by cycling through the leidsestraat ( well there is n't a bicycle path there technically ) . 
  jesus christ never again . 
  i just avoid going to the centre as much as i can . 
  the bicycle paths . 
  you fucking know why . 
  i wonder how the suicide rates are distributed over flanders and wallonia . 
  yes i 'm all for it  . 
  we should call it benedelux ( benede ( n ) means down ( stairs ) in dutch so that 's nice ) . 
  we both have gibberish languages , we 're both threatened by the sea , we both love bicycles , there are so many similarities , if germany was n't between us , we should 've been united already . 
  that being said , the only flag you frequently see waving here , outside of special events , is the turkish flag ( in the big cities at least lol ) . 
  this is so true , it is very very very ( and i mean very ) rare to see a dutch flag waving from a private building when it 's not a national holiday or during the world/eurocup . 
  seeing the eu flag is just impossible , which i yet have to see . 
  i 've encountered only a few times the sidewalks were covered in worms here in amsterdam . 
  it had rained quite a lot and they were literally everywhere . 
  i had to walk carefully not squishing them . 
  we could just abandon them too , hell just abandon all irrelevant provinces and lets make a new country out of both hollands , utrecht , flanders and noord-brabant to keep us connected . 
  i would n't mind to unite with belgium , only if they abandon their southern half , 
  yes !, 
  people always give me weird looks when i tell them we do this on easer instead of the `` traditional egg hunt '' . 
  well i 'm living at home so my mother cooks for us . 
  our top 5 meals are : - baked potato slices dressed with black cumin seeds and other herbs - spicy chicken with bulgur - pasta/spaghetti - zucchhini soup - something called fasulyah , with rice, 
  [ she sure does .

  my neighbours are sikhs and i sometimes come across them at work , they 're very nice and polite people , more i ca n't say . 
  i 've never heard negative things about them here . 
  or do they have to be alive ? 
  the cultural victory shall be ours . 
  yeah i just realized that ... 
  this is an unacceptable mistake for me since i get a decent amount of maths in my study : /, 
  i 'm so ashamed right now . 
  so much for basic maths . 
  i love the level of detail on it !, 
  we 're stuck with [ these things : / ] ( http://imgur.com/a/rdtew ), 
  well it 's also the thought that counts !, 
   the dutch we barely have an army , which is in bad shape due budget cuts . 
  while we 're at it , i 'm sure the britons would also be open to accept our lovely euro , 
  yeah i guess it 's pretty hard adjusting to a new currency on an old age after using litas for many years ( i was really young when the euro got introduced here and do n't really remember the gulden except for seeing it in old textbooks ) . 
  but i 'm glad people are liking and willing to accept it . 
  and i can assume the salaries were the only thing that did n't increase ? 
  we actually have a mountain of 887 meters !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ caribbean ^ ^ ^ ^ netherlands, 
  hey , so do we !, 
  i kinda expected the netherlands to be at the bottom . 
  we do n't have that much sunshine , so solar energy is n't really efficient i think . 
  we have a lot of windmills though , but apparently we have no mountains , so no hydropower . 
  no big forests either , so using biomass for generating electricity is n't an option either . 
  windmills are the only real option , and we have a lot of those things already . 
  a thin and long green thing , 
  jesus christ ... those guys , especially that little brat , made my blood fucking boil . 
  let them stay in syria , iraq , saudi arabia or other strict muslim countries for a while and we shall see how fast they 'll be begging for western values .
