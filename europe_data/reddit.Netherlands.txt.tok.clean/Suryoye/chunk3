  one thing that has been bothering me ( which is not your fault ) is when you quit hovering above the map of europe in the sidebar and the flags immediately turn yellow . 
  would it be hard to let the flags minimize first and then turn it yellow ? 
  for me it 's ritter sport , verkade and tony 's chocolate here in the netherlands . 
  milka is too sweet and overwhelming after a few pieces imo . 
  if i 'm honest , i find milka too sweet and can only eat a few pieces before it becomes overwhelming . 
  [ yeah is n't it obvious ? 
  this is a conspiracy by the leftists to destroy germany . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/4dgim8/merkel_disgusted_by_sight_of_german_flag/ ), 
  yeah ffs the packaging of all other chocolate eggs even say `` happy easter '' . 
  [ link to the chocolate eggs on the stores website . 
  lol , even the ^ ^ ^ ^ caribbean netherlands has a [ mountain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_scenery#/media/file:view_from_mt_scenery,_saba.jpg ) . 
  does n't our soft soil prevent us from building any really tall buildings ? 
  our infrastructure would be my first guess . 
  yeah i had the same reaction . 
  soviet union 2.0 is something i would expect from facebook and youtube comments . 
  this sub has really turned into shit . 
  benelux !, 
  or she 's just leaning over the arm rest for a better talk ... 
  damn i know she 's currently not the best politician , but the insults are getting ridiculous . 
  [ relevant . 
  i can confirm the poor integration of christian arabs in sodertalje . 
  a big part of my family lives there . 
  most of the arab christians in sodertalje are assyrians/arameans . 
  they are usually wonderfull people who are integrated in their host country because they 're less likely to form ` ghetto 's ' due the small amount of assyrians/arameans ( and other arab christians ) and thus having more contact with the local culture . 
  this is obviously not the case in sodertalje , where apparently a lot of arab christians went to and formed ` ghetto 's ' by segregating themself due culture differences . 
  this may sound stupid , but why/how is pizza unhealthy ? 
  i mean , the way my mom makes it , it is dough , tomato sauce , cheese and some vegetables optionally . 
  that 's not unhealthy right ? 
  hmm i did n't know that . 
  my mothers native cuisine ( assyrian/levantine ) calls it burek , both the cheese ( sometimes with spinach ) and meat version . 
  both are layered . 
  d-d-did i say something wrong ? 
  damn you 're going to trigger some people . 
  oh burek is so amazing , both the cheese and meat version . 
  the entire balkan cuisine is freaking great . 
  damn . 
  is there food from italy that 's not delicious ? 
  i 'm sure as hell gon na try those desserts out . 
  that was / u/jijdaar, 
  you 're greatly misusing the word `` oppressive '' here pal . 
  i recommend reading [ here ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oppressive ) and [ here ] ( http://www.pcc.edu/resources/illumination/documents/institutionalized-oppression-definitions.pdf ) for the actual definition . 
  eh no , the reason is that people are afraid of hordes of people coming here to abuse the social benefits system , which is already happening with the roma . 
  kinda ironic now with all those refugees doing the same . 
  afhanistan and pakistan do n't speak arabic and both use a modified form of the arabic writing system , so they probably wo n't be able to read it . 
  syria and iraq speak a slightly different dialect but they can understand each other fine as far as i know, 
   but their cheeses are not very great http://i.imgur.com/sorktad.jpg maybe you would like them if we threw in some mold , 
  i should n't have called it hypocrisy since her situation and the current are different . 
  i 'm not judging her for wanting to keep other migrants out , it sounded a bit hypocritical even though i can understand why . 
  i should n't have called it hypocrisy since her situation and the current are different . 
  i 'm not judging her for wanting to keep other migrants out , it sounded a bit hypocritical even though i can understand why . 
  i 've actually never really asked that , but i know my mothers sister moved to sweden and her uncle to the netherlands a while earlier . 
  so i guess it was for family and economic reasons ( yeah it sounds hypocritical , i know ) . 
  both , but it 's more of the latter . 
  she , and the rest of her family ( and family from previous generations ) have had really bad interactions with the people there ( we 're christian so you can probably imagine ) . 
  they fled syria because the village they lived in was getting more and more islamic to a point her dad ( my grandfather ) saw no safe future for his children and migrated to the netherlands ( another big part of the family moved to sweden ) . 
  and now they 're pissed about the people they fled for , are coming in huge waves to europe ( i know it sounds hypocritical ) and bringing their middle-eastern ideology while getting all kinds of nice accommodations she and her family had worked really hard for . 
  well this goes both ways , either you or me is misinterpreting the video . 
  not that it 's going to have any effect since goal has been reached anyways . 
  i 'm not going to vote on this since it 's such a joke referendum . 
  the output wo n't probably change much at all . 
  of course you ca n't annex a country when you do n't have territory of your own , but the video makes it sound like you can . 
  that 's my whole point . 
  they 're using a vague analogy with the soviet-union to put the eu in bad light and of course attract anti-eu people to sign this referendum . 
  yeah i can confirm . 
  my mother is a syrian migrant herself ( migrated around 30 years ago with the entire family to the netherlands ) and she ( and the rest of the family ) is so freaking pissed about the whole of europe barely doing anything to stop this immigration . 
  if it were for her , a wall from the core of the earth to space with guns , lasers , razor wire , etc , would be erected around europe to keep refugees/migrants out . 
  edit : i accidentally a few words, 
  i 've never said the video is n't pro-russia , which it clearly is n't . 
  i 'm still not convinced the proper translation of `` inlijven '' in the context of this video is `` to incorporate '' . 
  i know the eu and nato are n't able to annex other countries , but this video is making it look like it is . 
  that whole video is almost a complete joke in my opinion . 
  i 'm dutch too you know . 
  the whole tone of the video is anti-eu , no denying in that . 
  the context ( `` all 3 countries once belonged to the soviet-union '' ) before the `` inlijf '' part makes it sound like they were clearly referring to `` annexing '' . 
  ugh yes , pleaaaase go to other cities , amsterdam is too overcrowded . 
  go walk on other cities bicycle paths . 
  yeah agreed , and i say that as a dutchman . 
  i really like your redesigns , cleaner and visually appealing . 
  the americans have , to my surprise , beaten us to be even more confusing . 
  that 's like 140k m ^ 2 3 times as big as my country ... 
  should 've added individual territory to make it even more confusing . 
  and gosh , that flag is horrible . 
  on one side they should 've kept it to annoy turkey but on the other hand i 'm glad they rejected it . 
  a part of kazachstan ( like 5 % ) lies within europe . 
  [ to make it even more confusing ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/supranational_european_bodies-en.svg ), 
  i ca n't really remember the gulden notes but i really like the 50 , 100 and 250 notes ( others are kinda obnoxious imho ) . 
  you have a point there , i use my debit card 90 % of the time anyway . 
  but there 's still something about having nicely looking notes in your wallet . 
  am i the only one who likes the euro 's design :[, 
  lmao you just described my dad . 
  ehh he picked some good looking examples . 
  only old city centers and smaller villages look like that . 
  what you described also applies to the majority of houses here . 
  most neighbourhoods kinda look like [ this ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=rijtjeshuizen&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=n1y&amp;channel=fs&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewinqikpgpjmahwmbcakhxrubvcq_auibygb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955#channel=fs&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=rijtjeshuizen+nederland ) with the same house being literally copied and pasted next to it . 
  socks with sandals . 
  the majority should n't have a say in deciding the rights of the minority . 
  200g - 1.57 $ 400g - 2.32 $ 630g - 3.56 $, 
  belgium , well flanders at least . 
  it 's kinda speaking for itself . 
  we have ( almost ) the same language , similar culture , history and people .
