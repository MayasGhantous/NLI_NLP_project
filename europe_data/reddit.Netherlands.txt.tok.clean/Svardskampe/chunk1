well it is to be noted that he amount of people willing to get shitfaced is not that large . 
  as much as i love my beers and as much as think cannabis can be a chill outlet once in a while , every evening with them is not a productive evening . 
  maybe not even a productive next morning . 
  completely abstaining from distractions is invariably linked to higher production though . 
  ( of course , perhaps also a less fun life ), 
  maybe it 's not primitive , but actually the better way to look at it from a development perspective . 
  as well as alcohol that is taxed through the roof . 
  case in point still stands that alcohol and cannabis are nonvital distractions . 
  less distractions , is more productivity . 
  it would have individually caused a lot less growth . 
  the unification of currency was no small political task , and if it was n't projected to be insanely beneficial it would not have been done at all . 
  the fact of the matter is that in todays global market currency is a commodity as well , and having the # 2 most sought after commodity ( under the usd ) makes it a pretty good deal , instead of competing on eachother and where no one hardly gets in the top 5 after the usd , the yen , the yuan and who knows , the canadian and australian dollars ? 
  it has caused grief as well of course , where greece basically was n't allowed to fail because of being euro territory . 
  we do have another example case where it did happen who kept their own currency : iceland . 
  however iceland made a recovery after 2011 due to very stringent governmental austerity from their own people out . 
  deals with dutch and british deposits . 
  the question is more here whether greece would have been capable to do the same as iceland did . 
  that is a debate of `` what-if '' . 
  in my ** personal ** opinion , comparing the icelandic with the greek government , one has showed leadership and actual decisions . 
  the other has seen nothing but political uncertainty , uproar in fascism and only showing compliance with very basic demands like restructuring after countless times . 
  only as of this month actually i 've seen the first positive message from greece out reiterating a pledge where they would change 21 actions by next year . 
  [ source ] ( http://english.capital.gr/news.asp?id=2436103 ) . 
  i am personally not convinced that greece the situation for greece would have been better off defaulting and handling their own currency as they have shown nothing but political incompetence versus the icelandic government . 
  ** answer to the actual question ** : yes it is better than the original guilder because the guilder could have never even dreamt of becoming the # 2 wanted currency in the world . 
  funny how you take the mafia as an example , as that is the most free market way one takes your money away , not constrained by law or regulations . 
  in a world where everyone pays for his own `` police force '' ( a.k.a. 
  mercenaries ) , how do you think that differs from a mafia-ran society ? 
  i actually moved from belgium -  the netherlands for this reason . 
  on the holland vs netherlands discussion . 
  you have several people saying they do n't mind either way with the dutch flag next to their name . 
  that is most of the time because these posters would be actually coming from the `` holland '' part . 
   say czech beer is watery shit in comparison to x beer . 
  i do n't know what barbaric tasteless person would say that . 
  comparing czech beer , pilsners alike , there is nothing like urquell pilsner . 
  the complaint that it 's watery is stupid because it 's pilsner . 
  i like my belgian ales too , or a weizen , but it 's an entirely different drink . 
   calling someone `` debil '' ( retard ) --  offender got defenestrated . 
  no , i 'm not kidding . 
  defenestration is something the czechs like for some reason . 
  the entire reason i learned the word `` fenestra - window '' in latin class , was because of the so called `` defenstration of prague '' . 
  but what would be a serious problem here would be to wear football gear of the opposing city in public , like feyenoord stuff in amsterdam or ajax stuff in rotterdam . 
  it 's that most tattoos are done by trashy people , women with some curly letters , or burly guys that look to come straight from prison . 
  there are just very few that keep it to a tasteful level . 
   really just wants to experience of life in another country ? 
  lots of people say this , but actually do n't want this . 
  the tourist things are also the interesting things of course . 
  otherwise they would n't be touristy . 
  you may have the hidden gem here and there ( e.g. 
  urquell brewery in plzen around prague ) , but doing `` life stuff '' can be quite boring as well . 
  you only have 14 days btw , and you are rushing 4 cities in them , and you want to experience `` life in another country ? '', 
  defrost fish , and the odd cup of milk to make warm milk for a hot coco . 
  it 's that its there in my student housing , i would just not buy one if i were to live on my own . 
  i feel american questions could be curbed a bit more down that relate to them . 
  `` what do you learn about america in history class '' `` how much do you know about the nba/american football/nhl / ... '' . 
  i would suggest creating a megethread r/askeuropeaboutamerica to disincentivise this and make loose threads like this reportable and remove them . 
  the same for top-level comments . 
  if it is someone american replying to the question , and the answer relates to the usa , and not < country of europe where they may have lived or live  , that comment should be reportable and deleted . 
  nexit is not a thing in the country atm . 
  foreign news makes it look like it is because drama over the upcoming elections this week , but it 's not even a way for our version of trump to shout over to stir the shit . 
   decided to withdraw because it was not the right career for me but what is though ? 
  specifically where i live , eindhoven , the netherlands , there is a big expat community . 
  people do their master degrees or are living and working here for 4 years already without speaking a word of dutch and having no intention to . 
  english is the spoken language in a lot of technical companies here , especially if it is related to it . 
  if you wish to work in amsterdam , you will probably want to live in or around the surrounding `` suburbs '' , which are technically their own towns and cities , but coming from sf you will find it will feel a lot like suburbs from a single city there . 
  do note that most likely , yes , you will be expected to speak dutch there . 
  you can only get away socially in the inner city center ( s ) . 
  i have wanted to go to hannover once for cebit anyway though , though the train cost prohibited me as it was $ 170 . 
  i can take 4 planes with that from ryanair ... 
   but , their english proficiency is extremely overrated in my opinion you have to really compare it with the surrounding countries though to put it in perspective . 
  all the signs and menus are bilingual and pretty much everyone in the bigger cities can communicate well . 
  they are closest to italy , sicily where they outright hardly speak any english at all . 
  never mind to find something actually written in english . 
  i went to malta past summer . 
  i had 7 days filled to the brim with activities and i could easily fill another day there where i glossed over mdina . 
  maybe i should save my opinion on berlin then and i might visit it one time if it truly has an incredible amount of weird stuff and if it proves to be interesting outside of ww2 as well . 
  ( however i would of course not completely avoid ww2 topics , but ye ) . 
  well , i have seen more than beer gardens in munich , i was facetious there ; i 've been to the english garden , strolled around the city and saw some interesting city views on the rathaus and on the marienplatz where there was a guy playing music on wine glasses . 
  it was nice for a day . 
  but nothing struck out to me as something `` yes , this is why i had to visit this city '' . 
  we continued our journey and in every place there was something that was worth it ; salzburg had the fortress on top of the surrounding mountains which made for a few days of really interesting walking with a continuous view over the city , the river and land . 
  continuing to prague , which is often touted as one of the better cities to visit with numerous attractions ; the bridge , the monastery , the castle and town square , the cathedral , various interesting museums on history and technical items , the park and seeing the amazing view of the river and the architecture itself which was coherent and colorful . 
  and then in and around slovenia we went on the soci river and camped at an amazing place in the valley , following it along straight to trieste , koper and izola which made for a really varied couple of days seeing the difference in the `` mountainous '' culture and the mediterranean , continued by visiting ljubljana and lake bled . 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af maybe if you would include neuschwanstein in munich , it may have been worth it . 
  we wanted to visit that really badly , but it was out of the way . 
  it 's a shame i did n't plan for n\u00fcrnberg , as that seems more interesting after than munich entirely to be honest . 
  germany . 
  there is very little unique to see or do even in larger cities . 
  i 've been to munich , and even that visit was cut short on our roundtrip as at any rate , a day extra in prague seemed much more interesting . 
  the beergardens are fun for a while , but ca n't entertain you for days on end . 
  there is no reason at all i 'd want to make a stop in say berlin . 
  especially not because i feel like i 've been oversaturated with ww2 stuff for an entire lifetime and have very little need to visit more museums on that . 
  because those words are actually used in common speech , while i have literally never heard the other terms being spoken out loud . 
  if they are never used in real life , why fill up wikipedia with them ? 
  i 've always found the l'ordi term such a far departure from its base `` computer '' . 
  in this instance yes . 
  the dutch language is full of anglicisms and even in the short description res shows you will see `` threads '' , `` desktopcomputer '' . 
  the article also links to another article titled `` multiprocessing '' . 
  these it terms are never translated in normal word of mouth . 
  a lot of translations make my toes curl up though , just an example ; [ dutch version of multicoreprocessors ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/multikernprocessor ) it seems to be removed by now , but in the age of the core 2 duo it used to feature `` tweekernprocessor '' for dual core processor . 
  the translation is just so gah !,
