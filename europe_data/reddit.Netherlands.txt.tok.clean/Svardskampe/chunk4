  but you can go up how high you 'd like . 
  cheaper at the stools instead of a table is not something i 've seen in belgium or france . 
  i have seen this practice in italy , but then it was mostly for coffee bars , but by customary decency you would n't be sitting at the bar eating your meal , that would just be for a quick espresso . 
  it might be something they do in paris though , to encourage filling up more spots as quickly as possible . 
  ( which is why in very touristic areas in rome they have a third , higher , price for the terrace outside ) tipping practices is mostly just rounding it up to the nearest 10 or 5 ( the smallest note ) , more as a thing of the waiter not having to mess with change . 
  ( $ 32 becomes 35 , $ 46 rounds up to $ 50 ) . 
  you address this discretely when you hand over the cash and the waiter stows it away by saying `` never mind '' as in , never mind the change . 
  you could add a small wave with your hand down as well as a nonverbal sign if you 're not sure you were clear . 
  prepare for portions in france to be really really small though . 
  where i often have just a main course in belgium , a two or three-course meal fills you up as much in france . 
  this does make france a tad more expensive in that regard . 
  though in contrast , french restaurants usually dare to put in somewhat more expensive ingredients . 
  next to the drying horse shown by / u/jarasm , there are also door models : [ simple ] ( https://s.s-bol.com/imgbase0/imagebase/large/fc/8/1/7/4/9200000020094718.jpg ) [ tiered ] ( http://www.ibood.com/img/big_pictures/12/ruco_droogrek_01_600.jpg ) you can usually hang those simple models in the opening of the stairsways as well . 
  so if you ca n't manage to fit all of your clothes on every single door you have in the house , the stairway area , and all the hallways filled with drying horses , i think it might be time to start investing in a dryer . 
  sounds ok-ish . 
  be sure to take microfiber towels with you . 
  they save on space and you would n't believe how much a towel could save you ; rains , water accidents , quick bandage , or when the vorgons suddenly want to build a galaxy expressway through your planet . 
  nope , but i think even having a motion over it , the wage of all european politicians combined would outweigh the cost over this by far . 
  ye , i have 100/100 fibre within my rent . 
  ( technically $ 18 per month of my rent goes towards that ) . 
  i came from belgium , where anything technology is horrible and at least 10y behind of infrastructure . 
  much to my dismay , no we do n't :( , this might be the year i go for a small portable one though . 
  but as we are n't big in acs i do n't know what is a good one to pick either . 
  bit of a catch-22, 
  they make everything in china ultimately . 
  so why would that be odd ? 
  if there are specific use cases , like camera hardware , you can get them at specific camera-shops , like here for example : http://www.fotobooms.nl/cat/0/276/799/0/statieven%3a-cameras-hama - ( statieven - % 26amp % 3b-accessoires ) . html same for vesa mounts for displays i believe that also use imperial threads . 
  i ca n't think of anything else right now that has critical measurements like that ... 
  but generally not at a conventional hardware store . 
  but anyway , it 's always cheaper to import it from china through aliexpress anyway , and they have everything ... so i just get my stuff from there regardless . 
  edit : i remember gas pipe fittings . 
  omg , those are a hell to get the right ones for your stove if it is a weird brand . 
  there is m24 , 1/2 '' , 3/4 '' ... 
  the hardware store is loaded with conversion parts . 
  and if all else fails because you ca n't find the right conversion part , just put a flexible tube on it as close as possible in size and clamp it down with those metal clamps . 
  there are so many supermarkets in my neighbourhood , i can choose to go either the one just down the street 300m further , and get my dailies , and for some bigger groceries i hop on the bike for 2 large bags , one on each handle for the lidl . 
  tuesday it 's market day in my city , and i only pass by at the end when i come home from work to ask the fish guy if he has something he wants to get rid off at the end of the day . 
  if not for this discount , the prices are as expensive or more expensive than in the supermarket . 
  why would i go to an inconvenient market where you ca n't understand the guy , is usually a little sleezy , and i have to think about when they stand their for just a set hours a week , if i could go to the supermarket that 's open 8.00-22 .00 for the same price and i can just drop my stuff on the conveyor , swipe the card and leave ? 
  i never felt the need to be close to specialties like that though . 
  when i was looking for a room my questions mostly were limited to : - how is the internet ? 
  - where is the closest supermarket ? 
  - where do you pick up your packages when not home ? 
  i 'm just surprised you want to go on a holiday with these kind of people . 
  i 've had history in belgium with really critical footnotes to common facts and how they are often hidden and shoved aside . 
  for example , concerning to you as an american , americans learn how pearl harbor was an attack from japan denoting the start of the war between us and japan . 
  everything before is shoved under the rug . 
  actually countries do not suddenly attack a big naval base out of thin air , but was an attack in holding back the western expansion by the americans to defend their own soil . 
  as well as the command for the bombs being dropped given before the grace period ended where the japanese could surrender . 
  from tutoring in the netherlands now , i hear that a lot of dutch history is also very propagandic towards the netherlands itself , much like american history about the usa . 
  how surinam for nyc was a `` fair trade '' and not because of the loss of the 4th anglo dutch sea war . 
  depends if you are a student or not . 
  do you even read posts outside of their title though ? 
  ... which is exactly why i 'm applauding that in my top post ? 
  i suppose so . 
  does n't mean that there are a lot that do though . 
  my r at least does n't make millions of belgians cringe every time they hear it , and avoid dubs of series alltogether if it 's being spoken with too much of a `` hollands '' accent . 
  hollande is just a region indeed . 
  i myself am from brabant for example . 
  phrases are just phrases i am afraid , and is not even the start of learning a language . 
  you learn a language by attaining a grammatical framework , in which you can place the correct structure elements in order to make it clear on what you want to communicate . 
  you simply start this in most languages by learning the conjugation of `` to be '' and `` to have '' . 
  this opens your range already with a lot of information . 
  you can tell who you are , what your interests are , and what you seek , as everything can be appended after `` i am '' already . 
  this framework is expanded upon , and you learn what pronouns are , the conjugations , the tenses and then ... somewhat throughout here and there ... just some vocabulary . 
  but to actually start speaking and * learning * a language , vocabulary is of lesser importance at first , where you can simply google translate a word if you are looking for it . 
  per excercise , let me tell you the conjugations of `` to be '' in dutch : to be | zijn -- | -- i am | ik ben you are | jij bent he/she/it is | hij/zij/het is we are | wij zijn you ( pl . ), 
  are | jullie zijn they are | zij zijn now for some simple words , use [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.nl/#en/nl/ ) for single words , and try to say the following thing in dutch . 
   they are here . 
  he is busy . 
  she is looking around . 
  i am telling them . 
  the station is there . 
  the creation of ( simple ) phrases lends you so much more power as it allows you to use every word in the context with other parts , creating a scale of x ^ n possibilities to communicate a sentence , whereas knowing a `` phrase '' is just 1 phrase you know . 
   nederland ** s ** the country ( the netherlands ) : nederland the people ( the dutch ) : nederlanders the language ( dutch ) : nederlands adjective ( dutch ) : nederlands/nederlandse ( unfortunately i do n't know really the rule when to use the e or not . 
  i think every word that starts with `` het '' is without e , and every word that uses `` de '' is with e. plural is with e at all times , but that is also congruent with that every plural noun starts with `` de '' and never `` het '' ) . 
  to add to that , the difference when using de/het . 
  `` de '' is gendered ( male and female ) , while `` het '' is genderless . 
  but if you make something small with a suffix - je , it 's always `` het '' . 
  even for a word like `` het meisje '' ( the [ little ] girl ) . 
  in other words for practicality : do n't even bother learning a rule on this ... just take every single word slowly and in time you 'll get a `` feeling '' or simply know what you need to use with each word . 
  but ye , paging / u/obraka for tips maybe , as he came from austria , so with a comparable background , and i can definitely vouch for his understanding of dutch to be really good as a second language . 
  as soon as he is willing to learn a language that is so obscure , nowhere spoken outside of the netherlands and not that easy because everyone switches instantly back to english without a second thought , yes , definitely . 
  yes it 's the same video on vimeo  , and ye , the finnish one is definitely funny , but it 's meant that way . 
  it kind of takes away from the joke then . 
  well ... as i 'm dutch ... it 's pretty popular . 
  [ but of course it ca n't hold a candle in the wind against our best export product we have . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lapwxavooge ), 
  yea , all of the market dealers i go to have card readers too . 
  and the fact i do n't have any cash is a nice excuse anyway not to pay those . 
  i 'd say cash free is pretty common in the netherlands . 
  even for small amounts they now implement those rfid payments where you do n't have to enter a pin under 25 euros . 
  any starbucks or mcdonalds already has wifi , and there are plenty of mom and pop stores . 
  i would n't sweat it . 
  i guess it depends where you 're going . 
  for rural areas , alright , but i say there is enough wifi in the cities . 
  i do n't know how addicted you are to your phone , but when i travelled through germany , the czech , austria , slovenia last summer over 3 weeks , i never felt the need to get a new sim . 
  there is wifi in enough places and the emergency number always works . 
  what more do you need ? 
  reddit makes me weep nowadays .
