  in amsterdam we care because she also ran an illegal hotel . 
  there are far too many illegal hotels in amsterdam and it 's a serious problem .

   for one , having good credit is a great thing to have . 
  there may come a time where an urgent need for a loan is upon you , and the years of paying off a card will greatly aid in this endeavor . 
  [ that works differently outside of the us .

  prince philip can be amusingly politically incorrect . 
  around 20 years ago a discount supermarket started selling bagged milk in the netherlands . 
  it did n't last long . 
  apparently it did n't sell . 
   the ef english proficiency index calculates a country 's average adult english skill level using data from two different ef english tests . 
  one test is open to any internet user for free . 
  the second is an online placement test used by ef during the enrollment process for english courses . 
  both include grammar , vocabulary , reading , and listening sections . 
    only countries with a minimum of 400 test takers were included in the index . 
  countries with fewer than 100 test takers on either of the two tests were also excluded , regardless of the total number of test takers . 
    in order to calculate a country 's ef epi score , each test score was normalized to obtain a percentage correct for that test according to the total number of questions . 
  all the scores for a country were then averaged across the two tests , giving equal weight to each test . 
  the old czech man who tried to give me directions in the middle of nowhere probably did n't take this internet test . 
  i watch both [ rallfystuff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/ralfystuff ) ( whisky ) and [ bigclivedotcom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/bigclivedotcom ) ( electronics ) .

  we do have satellite radio . 
  [ here is a list ] ( http://www.onastra.com/16665077/channels?free=yes&amp;pay=yes&amp;mode=radio&amp;sd=yes&amp;hd=yes#!/channels ) of the radio channels relayed by the astra satellite . 
  i 've never heard of it being fitted on a car . 
  it 's more of an extra with your satellite tv . 
  the picture you posted shows a bike path with dirt next to it . 
  how could he know dutch bike paths are red ? 
  nonsense , we also have incredibly unclearly marked bike paths in the netherlands . 
  some examples : bricks oriented in a different way and some paint in front of leiden station : [ streetview ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@52.1657957,4.4833096,3a,75y,216.11h,85.49t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1szbfu9xlzxulb2sm4unu8zw!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo2.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dzbfu9xlzxulb2sm4unu8zw%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d222.03508%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656 ) colour of pike path faded and tiny difference in height with the sidewalk in amsterdam : [ streetview ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@52.3632013,4.8798621,3a,75y,349.17h,69.09t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sbpjglzjvzpbudy5xxei55q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) something that looks like a cosy footpath next to the canal in amsterdam , the sign appears to be completely invisible to tourists , there is always someone walking there : [ streetview ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@52.3617135,4.8870666,3a,75y,40.89h,62.2t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s2zlbhgy-njgjjczpzd4y7a!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3d2zlbhgy-njgjjczpzd4y7a%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d57.249512%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656 ), 
  i knew the danes have bike paths . 
  i did n't know what they would exactly look like . 
  when you 're trying to find your way in an unfamiliar city it 's easy to miss subtle visual cues . 
  i 've also walked on `` bike paths '' in italy , france and austria . 
  but in my defence they were just some paint on the sidewalk . 
  you can buy insurance for a car on export plates in germany , for instance at [ adac ] ( https://www.adac.de/infotestrat/fahrzeugkauf-und-verkauf/import-export/exportkennzeichen/default.aspx?prevpagenfb=1 ) . 
  the difference between a sidewalk and a bike path can be very subtle for people who do n't know what to look for . 
  i walked on a bike path in copenhagen once because it did not recognise it as a bike path until i was nearly run over . 
  it must be more difficult for people who come from countries without bicycle paths . 
  you should take a look at [ belgium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_governments_in_belgium ) . 
  [ std tests ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/08/26/soa-tests-zijn-te-duur-1287581-a941505 ) are n't covered by insurance and can cost a few hundred euros . 
  it 's also an issue for more acute problems . 
  the deductible for health insurance is between $ 385 and $ 885 per year . 
  a trip to the emergency room costs a minimum of $ 175 , which is a lot of money for many people . 
  i just saw one for the first time this evening in amsterdam ( couple of hours after reading this post ) . 
  perhaps we both had n't noticed them . 
  not only gas , water is also usually in inches . 
  showers are always 1/2 '' . 
  no , a one-country interrail pass is for travel within one country . 
  for your journey you 'd need the global pass . 
  well , you could take the [ train ] ( http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query2.exe/en?ld=9642&amp;seqnr=1&amp;ident=2p.02623042.1433793990&amp;rt=1&amp;remembersorttype=mindeparture&amp;hwai=js!ajax=yes!&amp;hwai=connection$c0-2!id=c0-2!hwaiconid=c0-2!hwaidetailstatus=details!;~connection$c0-2!hwaimapstatus=undefined!hwaimapnumber=undefined!hwaimapslider=undefined!hwaidetailhimmessage=undefined!; ) . 
  it 'll take two days . 
  but lisbon and berlin are not in the same country , so a one-country pass wo n't do . 
  flying will be cheaper and faster . 
  did you expect to feel at home ? 
  why ? 
  ghent is nicer : go to the [ cathedral ] ( http://www.sintbaafskathedraal.be/ ) and see their [ altarpiece ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghent_altarpiece ) ( altarpiece is being renovated so not all the panels are on display and it is behind glass ) . 
  if you change your mind and do want to go to a museum go to [ msk gent ] ( http://www.mskgent.be/en/collection ) . 
  conditions of the savers fare seem clear to me :  this is a linked train route . 
  this means your ticket is only valid for the exact trains printed on your ticket . 
  a limited number of tickets are available for purchase up to one day before date of travel . 
  you have to take the exact trains on the ticket ; you ca n't decide to leave a few hours later after you 've purchased them . 
  and there is a limited amount of these tickets . 
  if they sell out you 'll have to shell out for the more expensive ones . 
  you 'll want the german national railways : [ bahn.de ] ( http://www.bahn.de/p_en/view/ ) ice tickets are cheaper if you buy them early . 
  edit : flying to frankfurt am main will shave a couple of hours of your journey . 
  why are you flying to amsterdam ? 
  i agree with you on the swiss countryside . 
  this is the reason to not cut interlaken from your itinerary . 
  when the phrase `` the journey is the destination man . '', 
  was coined they surely must have been talking about riding a train through the alps . 
  brussels is not uninteresting . 
  the royal museums there are certainly worth a visit .
