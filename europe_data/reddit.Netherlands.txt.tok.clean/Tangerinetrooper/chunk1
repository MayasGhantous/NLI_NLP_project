yeaaah . . and the biggest party in the netherlands right now wants to expand our tax haven , to ` attract more business ' . 
  they should legalise anything that has been * proven * to be less harmful than alcohol , period . 
  anything less and you 're just being hypocritical , or you should also support banning alcohol ( and going with the track record of such laws , good luck with that ) . 
  edit : and about the rape thing . 
  of course we 're not going to legalise rape , since that 's an act in which you 're infringing on another one 's freedom . 
  the analogy does n't work . 
  and there 's only the western world interfering in governments in the middle east in the name of peace and democracy \u2122 . 
  it 's also not what i said , but what / u/hertyior said . 
  still , if all those countries were christians , we 'd probably have a massive surge of christian terrorism in europe . 
  religion has barely anything to do with it , interventionism in the middle east a lot more . 
   muslims have been killing muslims since islam came to existence that this statement is void . 
  you could also say  christians have been killing christians since christianity came to existence and it would n't be less true . 
  it does n't really say anything . 
   last i checked , all of these attackers were muslim , following islam . 
  which sort of islam ? 
  are you also going to blame the entirety christianity , protestantism , calvinism or the russian orthodoxy when one priest of those starts a killing spree ? 
  why do you think that ** all ** muslim moderates from ** all ** the different subcultures within islam are as much a danger as radicals ? 
  what is your last point though ? 
  i mean , i do agree with imperialistic tendencies and that our nations caused millions of deaths in the middle east . 
  my point was more along the lines of ` as long as we keep killing their civilians , they 'll probably keep killing ours . ', 
  muslim radicals kill muslim in the population . 
  and if you 're gon na pull that ` islum has always been violent durr ' , you completely overlook christianities ' atrocities . 
  but what is your point , if it is n't ` magical vetting ' , ` big brother overwatch ' , etc. ? 
  just to throw in random islam-hate ? 
   you reap what you sow . 
  this one is kinda true though . 
  let 's not forget all the interventions usa and us have done throughout the years in those areas . 
  what was it , hundreds of muslim civilians killed by american bombs in yemen just a few weeks ago ? 
  maybe it 's not because of your claims , but maybe it 's because you 're acting like an abrasive dick . 
  but . . then you could still flip the tram right side up right ? 
  why would you want it hanging :p, 
  try and pay attention next time on how you read an advertisement , comic or other still visual media . 
  i 've had a couple of lectures on that subject and they devoted a lot of time on the way you enter and walk through media visually . 
  in a well designed piece , they often designed a path for your eyes to follow . 
  remember , your eyes are very limited in what you can actively focus on ( around 2 degrees of visual angle ) . 
  but now you ` read ' the punchline before the rest of the joke . 
  it all boils down to the fact that our culture likes to read predominantly from left to right . 
  please stop oppressing me with your dextrocentrist worldview , it 's horribly ableist . 
  could you explain how that works ? 
  i 'm genuinely interested and i 'm not familiar with the process ( aside from a 5 minute google search ) . 
  why does a seceding state need consent of the other states and why does the constitution need to be amended ? 
  [ well , you 're just plain wrong . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secession_in_the_united_states ), 
  give it some time , trump has only just begun . 
  how is it apples and oranges and what does precedent with having been a nation have to do with anything ? 
  if california wants to stop being subject to stupid federal laws and want more freedom , would you support their segregation ? 
  i dunno , what were legitimate concerns ? 
  the money they did n't spend in the first place that they are n't going to be able to spend anyway once outside the eu ? 
  the whole campaign was pretty bull and full of lies . 
  does n't take away the fact that they wo n't be able to ** change the regulations they 're still subject to . 
  so how do you feel about that idea that california wanted to secede from the us ? 
  it 's not really butthurt , it 's mostly just stupid . 
  they 'll still have to trade predominantly with eu countries and need free trade agreements with all of them . 
  they still have to adhere to eu regulations , but now they 'll have no say in writing said regulations . 
  ` freedom ' is thrown around a lot , but i do n't see in any way how the uk has become more free now . 
  all i 'm seeing is turkish d\u00f6ner . 
  am i doing something wrong ? 
  is n't it also a better solution to supply the kitchen with better suctionhoods above the stove ? 
  ( also , is suctionhood the correct translation ? ), 
  do n't devalue your argument by playing the victim with ` you 're just going to downvote me ' . 
  because that 's a surefire way to get downvoted . 
  he 's such * not * a pussy that he : * blocks all attempts from journalists to question him critically * evades all the debates like the plague * just does n't even seem to try anymore * starts crying foul everytime someone says something hurtful about him * blocks you on frickin ' twitter if you say something to him he does n't like ( something something freeze peaches ) he 's just waiting for that welfare check to stick it out for another four years in our parliament . 
  always shouting and kicking against everything , but never coming up with anything concrete . 
  trump actually said some solid points on his campaign trail , but wilders ? 
  also hilarious , the guy wants to preserve dutch culture , but at the same time cut funding to culture and the arts because ` they are leftist hobbies ' . 
  he wants to stop building more windmills , i mean #freaking windmills . 
  the most dutch thing imaginable and he wants to stop building them ? 
  the guy is a walking contradiction . 
  luckily , it 's already wearing thin on more and more of his supporters . 
  you can only bitch and whine for so long before people start to see through that bleached facade . 
  he has been in a position of relative power for quite some time already , but almost all that time ** never proposed anything concrete and even voted against propositions he supported in his program . 
  ** if that 's your best shot you wish to support , the globalists have won already . 
  [ a lot , actually ] ( https://www.google.nl/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=erdogan+palpatine&amp;* ), 
  * arabic screeching *, 
  dangit . . 
  your version is way more witty and original . 
  `` so this is how liberty dies . . with thunderous applause . '', 
  but . . 
  but . . what about the amazing trainrides :(, 
  mass persecution is something completely different from a couple of bombings in belgium . 
  where 's this kristallnacht-level of antisemitism you seem to be evoking ? 
  but sure , let 's just lock all them muslims , because the only solution to apparent mass persecution is more mass persecution . 
  hard to ignore them when they never happened . 
  wheres this mass persecution youre talking about ? 
  sssssh , you 're indoctrinated by ultra-leftist media , therefore let the ` mericans handle this . 
  they got this . / s, 
  could you please tag this nsfw/nsfl ? 
  why ? 
  wow . 
  bookburning . 
  that seems like a lovely pasttime . 
  i 'm gon na grab my leather trenchcoat and supercool black officer hat and i 'll meet you outside , k ? 
  seriously though , that tactic seems flawless . 
  burn all books that have committed thoughtcrime . 
  because that 'll have noooo repercussions whatsoever . 
  well , how about we construct an aqueduct , but use it as a giant river rapids slide ? 
  you know , i never really thought about it like that . 
  i always associated the majesty and grandiose of the cathedral with the song . 
  like , the building as a second christ to save catalonia . 
  or something .
