you 've got some fucking nerve bringing up civilian deaths resulting from the ~ ~ civil war ~ ~ russian invasion in ukraine in this context mate . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reverse-racism-isnt-a-thing_us_55d60a91e4b07addcb45da97 ) [ you ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/heres-why-reverse-racism-doesnt-actually-exist-in-the-us-2016-4?r=us&amp;ir=t ) [ go ] ( http://www.dailydot.com/via/reverse-racism-doesnt-exist/ )  people of color talking about white people do n't occupy positions of privilege or power . 
  therefore , they can not be racist . 
  look at a map . 
  turkey controls the bosphorus strait and is thus a severe check on russia 's naval power projection into the mediterranean . 
  turkey also has the largest land force of any nato country after the us . 
  and of course turkey affords nato easy air/land power projection into the middle east , where russian bombers have to fly many extra miles to avoid crossing turkish air space . 
  not if you care about domestic economy . 
  multinationals doing ok on average is fine of course , but they 're not a great indicator of how britain is doing . 
   uk markets are doing fine ( highest in 10 months ) that 's [ not ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/314ed068-3c2d-11e6-8716-a4a71e8140b0.html#axzz4dykobtdj ) quite [ true ] ( http://www.ftse.com/products/indices/uk ) even if reported in ( heavily devalued ) gbp, 
  hold on mate , that unruly mob is just fine where they are on their little island thank you very much, 
   52 % from 40 % is about 20 % of the whole voting population turnout was 72,2 % , so 37.5 % voted leave . 
  doubt if most of them would again though , given the post-referendum drama and economical fallout, 
  merci !, 
  `` you can not have the butter , the money for the butter , and the ass of the creamer 's daughter '' that 's beautiful , what 's the original french ? 
  add the possibility of a trade war with china and things are looking bleak indeed . 
  every cloud has a silver lining . 
  free trade is good but i 'd prefer any disputes between corporations and my government to be ruled on by an actual judge . 
  srebrenica may be a factor here , but i feel our current government position is mainly driven by : fear of distancing ourselves from the usa . 
  nl is one of the most us-friendly countries in europe ( at least on defence matters ) and the us has been very much opposed to a european defense force independent from nato . 
  fear of feeding the alt-right flames : a euro-force will be seen as ` yet another ' transfer of national sovereignty to ` unelected bureaucrats ' rah rah etcetera . 
  i agree the president of parliament should defend ` parliamentary sovereignty ' if you will , but feel he should focus on presiding over meetings and guiding parliament in ` keeping the government honest ' . 
  i certainly would n't expect him to get directly involved with trade agreement negotiations ( ceta ) or foreign policy ( e.g. 
  comments on turkey ) . 
  maybe this is normal in other countries ( ? 
  ) , but from my dutch frame of reference it seems odd , and adds to the confusion about who exactly is in charge of eu policy . 
  is it common/accepted for the pr\u00e4sident des bundestages to express political views in public as schulz does ? 
  in the netherlands it would be unheard of for the voorzitter van de tweede kamer to behave in this way . 
  no he did n't http://stockholmcf.org/rutttes-spokesperson-refutes-pm-yildirim-says-no-apologies-were-made/, 
  yeah ... https://twitter.com/obstinateotter/status/840907608642998273, 
  the french , uk and us governments suspended all airstrikes from 28 may 1995 to protect un personnel taken hostage by the serbs . 
  they did not tell the dutch or bosnian authorities about this decision . 
  the complicated decision making process to get air support was also a problem : dutchbat requested air support multiple times between 6 and 11 july . 
  permission finally came noon 11 july , when the enclave was already overrun . 
  my intention is not to deny the mistakes made by the dutch . 
  i am asking you to not misrepresent the facts . 
  although your claims may not be quite as batshit insane as those made by akp to push their ` evil west hates all muslims ' narrative , they are still false and damaging to real people . 
   ankara also suspended high-level relations with amsterdam * the hague, 
  https://twitter.com/abdbozkurt/status/841950132497219585 you ca n't make this shit up . 
  except , apparently you can . 
  dutchbat was part of a un peacekeeping force , wich basically means they were there as human shields : lightly armed , surrounded , outnumbered , outgunned , attacked by both the muslims and the bosnian serbs , cut off from supplies and denied air support . 
  they were given a choice to surrender or die by mladic . 
  you can argue they should have chosen to die , and perhaps that would have been the honorable thing to do . 
  there was no way this would have saved the lives of the muslim men who were murdered by the bosnian serbs however . 
  the peace keeping mission was a complete failure and responsibility for this lies with the un , nato and the dutch government , who resigned over it . 
  but please show some respect to the people who died there , to their families and to the soldiers who were powerless to protect them , many of whom still suffer daily from the experience , by not grossly oversimplifying the facts . 
  fun fact : the term `` banana republic '' stems from the american united fruit co. `` united fruit had a deep and long-lasting impact on the economic and political development of several latin american countries . 
  critics often accused it of exploitative neocolonialism , and described it as the archetypal example of the influence of a multinational corporation on the internal politics of the banana republics . '', 
  has the_donald closed for lunch ? 
  this is so great, 
  calling us nazi remnants , accusing us of murdering 8000 people in bosnia and harvesting their childrens organs , stabbing oranges , burning french flags , beating up a norwegian reporter , deporting cows ... fine , go ahead if that 's what you need to blow off steam . 
  but this , this is crossing the line turkey . 
  this will not stand . 
  oh i suppose that makes it okay then \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  i do not use the term lightly . 
  i would never describe wilders as a nazi for instance , however much i disagree with him . 
  those pieces contain links to primary sources . 
  also see my reply to / u/javelinnl . 
  this quote is straight from the horse 's mouth , and if a politician talking about the need to maintain racial purity does n't worry you i 'm not sure what will . 
  true , it 's mostly just skirting nazi ideology without actually putting on the uniform . 
  most recently , this quote : `` onze elite is bezig ons homeopathisch te vermengen met alle andere volken opdat er nooit meer een nederlander zal zijn '' https://twitter.com/timengelbart/status/839558898197663761 this , apparently is now considered acceptable from a dutch politician . 
  aside from that the amount of circumstantial evidence is enough for me to be very suspicious of mr baudet . 
  where wilders is a raging xenophobe , thierry baudet ( fvd ) is an actual , certified neo-nazi . 
  he just puts a happy face on it . 
  i 'll pass on the weed , but you have my empathy . 
  i hope you and people like you will stay in turkey and fight though . 
  if all the well-off/educated people give up and leave for greener pastures you are just speeding up the decline of your country and condemning those who ca n't leave to live in distopia . 
  thankfully , this does n't seem likely at all to actually happen , so `` eu plans ... '' is a gross overstatement . 
  i expected better from politico than clickbait titles like this . 
  also : if we were to do something like this , should n't the party be for the ` head of state ' ? 
  that 's not what he commission president is . 
  i see 3rd generation immigrants identifying more with the country of their grandparents than with the country where they were born , went to school , and lived their entire life . 
  this is caused by the dutch having difficulty making friends , which is n't even true btw ? 
  this reeks of dodging responsibility and denying there may be a problem with your own attitude . 
  just from my personal experience : i know turks , morrocans , afghans , iranians , germans and spaniards who were n't even born here who are perfectly integrated . 
  the failure of some part of the dutch-turkish community to view themselves as part of dutch society is wholly their own . 
  do not underestimate the stupidity of the average voter, 
  now . 
  are you allright ? 
  please sit down and have a cup of tea . 
  tak for solidaritet !, 
  today we are all oranges \\ #jesuisorange, 
  dutch flag on instanbul consulate replaced with turkish this morning . 
  looks like ~ ~ turkey has severed diplomatic ties ~ ~ some random idiot climbed on the roof , replaced flag and is now shouting allahu akbar . 
  failure to protect consular grounds by turkish authorities is violation of vienna convention . 
  our penii are doing just fine , thank you, 
  no good at all , and this was never their intention . 
  however , containment ( not detainment ) of armed people by dsi was correct response . 
  i see the dutch response here as like a bouncer who with talk and gentle force gets an aggressive guest out of the club vs going all-out headlock style, 
  babies with at least one turkish citizen as a parent get automatic turkish citizenship . 
  the majority of turkish voters living in the eu are permanent residents and not just living here for a few years . 
  that said , i agree they should be allowed to vote if holding a turkish passport . 
  it 's the automatic granting of citizenship of a foreign nation to children born here that should be questioned . 
  i clearly remember hearing cavusoglu threatening sanctions while talks about his desired visit to our country were still ongoing . 
  after this insult it seems reasonable that he was asked not to visit today . 
  erdogans ` nazi ' comments and kaya 's secret border crossing after this were obvious provocations . 
  you and your politicians are always welcome to visit , but we do expect you to be gracious guests , just as we would be when visiting turkey . 
  turkey 's consul lied to mayor of rotterdam when asked if any further demonstrations were planned . 
  this happened after min . 
  cavusoglu was denied landing rights , before min .
