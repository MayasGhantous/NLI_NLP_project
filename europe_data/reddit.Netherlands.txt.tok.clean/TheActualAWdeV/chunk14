  but snor can also mean ( and usually does ) `` moustache '' . 
  as in , schnurr/schnurrbart ? 
  if he had applied his own bullshit , he would n't have even been fucking around in the ukraine in the first place . 
  and he would n't have stooges working in estonia either . 
  i 'm just referring to the first two sentences though . 
  if you live in russia , you should act like a russian . 
  okay , that 's an understandable view . 
  but if you live outside of russia , you should * also * act like a russian to give putin an excuse to enter the country you 're living in . 
  or to clarify my point ; `` in ukraine live ukrainians . 
  any minority , from anywhere , if it wants to live in the ukraine , to work and eat in the ukraine , should speak ukrainian and should respect the ukrainian laws '' . 
  see what i was getting at ? 
  it 's all well and good that he says those things about non-russians living in russia but he does n't apply it to russians living outside of russia . 
  and lol @ at the second part anyway . 
  suicides of nations , yeah right . 
  nope . 
  footpath is `` voetpad '' . 
   fu\u00dfweg this sounds like it means `` footroad '' , but the sign is about a bicycle path . 
  you can see two paths right next to eachother . 
  the one on the left seems fairly intact and looks like a footpath . 
  and the `` dirt road '' next to it is a damaged , poorly maintained bicycle path , i guess . 
  now if only he applied this to russians living outside of russia . 
  this is bourtange in the north-east of the netherlands . 
  heh , that looks cool . 
  the old castle looks adorably out of place on the star fort . 
  i thought at first they were protesting * against * ol' pooter and his crazy bullshit . 
  but `` russia !, 
  us together ! '', 
  kinda dispelled that notion . 
  let 's just hope it 's not a jar of parisian air . 
  would n't be all that much better . 
  hey , with zombies it 's eat or be eaten . 
  so would the nsa and the cia probably . 
  asia was easier than afrika or oceania and n. america to me . 
  the latter both suffer from an excess of pointless little islands . 
  it took me 157 attempts in a game to get all the states right . 
  :( got ukraine in one though !, 
  and got * both * georgia 's correct in one attempt each !, 
  more so because those goofballs * turned a bulldozer into a tank * . 
  that 's grade-a amusement right there . 
   all they do in the netherlands is border security and customs . 
  not entirely . 
  they 're part of the military ( next to the army , navy and airforce ) and they police the military , so to speak . 
  they also guard royal palaces and shit like that . 
  i dunno , that sounds a bit circular . 
  there already * is * a de-facto standard ; . doc ( x ) . 
  huh , you 'd almost think they were people too . 
   seriously ? 
  yeah . 
  true . 
  hmm maybe . 
  it sounds like a good point but word is pretty much ubiquitous , is n't it ? 
  and i know that me being the only one who used . odf was actually * less * productive because sometimes things got lost when it was opened by someone else 's word afterwards . 
  i guess i was thinking of innovation outside of word processors . 
  works better than open office . 
  okay , but how does that translate to real innovation and real procurement ? 
  is it somehow not real if it 's done in word ? 
   `` moving to odf would allow real innovation , and real procurement . '', 
  * how * . 
  it 's a file-format . 
  same as . doc , except open office ca n't deal with the newer versions of office file-extensions . 
  do n't be an asshole . 
  this map is n't about the * shorthand * either , it 's about the * names * . 
  the map is comparing two different things . 
  i 'm pointing out that that 's retarded . 
  * get it now ? 
  ca n't be , the average intelligence there is too high . 
  dutch also uses `` rond '' but not in the sense of `` a '' rond . 
  as in , something * is * round/rond but if you 're describing , say , a circle then you say `` cirkel '' or you use the diminuitive of rond and say rondje . 
  that 's horrible . 
  it 's * also * shorthand for apenstaartje . 
  which was my point . 
  go ahead man . 
  both moscow and petersburg looked better ( duh ) and it 's not muddy enough to be yekaterinburg . 
  although the trams were a bit better there with actual proper stops . 
  okay . 
  bit odd to claim that only '' @ '' represents '' @ '' . 
  i mean , we may * call * it a monkey 's tail , but it 's still '' @ '' . 
  it 's just the word for '' @ '' , like `` at '' is the word for it in english . 
  if this were a map of numbers , would it make sense to put a great big `` 5 '' over the uk and have the other countries say `` vijf '' , `` f\u00fcnf '' , `` cinq '' , etc ? 
   future nuh-uh . 
  hah , true . 
  ah yes . 
  much more reasonable and reliable than russia . 
  haha yeah saw it on the news this morning . 
   does coal count as a renewable source ? 
  nope . 
  and neither does gas . 
  we use a lot of gas and also still have a bunch of coal plants . 
  the total from coal ; [ 4,184 mw ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electricity_sector_in_the_netherlands ) seems to be significantly higher than that from wind ; [ 2,221 mw ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wind_power_in_the_netherlands ) . 
  only 4,5 % ? 
  we need more windmills ( - turbines ) !, 
  ooooooh . 
  i thought it was a strawberry at first too , do n't you worry . 
  i did n't quite make the punny link though . 
  romance languages are n't my area of interest . 
   also , i quite enjoy the friesland flag , but it should have been a chip !, 
  i understand what you 're getting at and it 's funny , but could you explain what the current thing is ? 
  i do not recognise it . 
  that 's a good point but i 'm not sure if it really * is * brighter or merely * looks * brighter because of there being several bright spots close together . 
  the hague is * really * close to rotterdam after all and i imagine together they 'd fit inside the greater london metropolitan area , even with the space in between included .
