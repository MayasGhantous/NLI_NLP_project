  you have an image of being slightly wishy-washy whiners . 
  and on the internet this is combined with a blowhard ` they 're all out to get us ' attitude . 
  i dunno , it 's a specific class of white people . 
  he was n't implying white people as a whole were , due to their whiteness , more likely to be single parents . 
  aw nuts . 
  i 'm trapped in an eternal afterlife of studying business and rushing after mistakes i 've made in the past . 
  \\* crunch *, 
  luckily it did n't lash out or anything when i flew away from that place . 
  okay mystery solved !, 
  everyone can go home now . 
  i also did a bit of limburg red because that accent has been a thorn in my side ever since wilders popularised it on tv . 
  ^ ( note ; i do not * actually * hate groningers and limburgers . ), 
  [ now with shitty joaks and pretend nationalism !, 
  circlejerk . 
  admittedly , the amount of times i had to take a shit when in russia was surprisingly low . 
  this explains why the russians barely had any toilet paper near their actual toilets . 
  those mountain-fuckers are up to something . 
  doubly landlocked ? 
  yeah right . 
  that 's what they all say . 
  awesome . 
  i think the `` focus on halting pollution '' criticism is a bit pointless too . 
  i mean , that shit should stop as well but just stopping it does n't clean up the current patches , which is sorely needed . 
  a solution like this would first reduce the current patches and secondly limit the damage done by further pollution . 
  and unless they 're actively doing something to halt that pollution themselves they just come across as if they were statler and waldorf . 
   mentioning sweden in a negative context . 
  so the danes , finns and the norwegians ? 
  then i 'm a bit curious why it 's in / r/europe . 
  although i do n't get where the several `` muh sweden '' comments came from though . 
  there 's always a lot of picking and choosing in even the most ` literal ' interpretation of anything . 
  i 'm sure some imams can come up with a relevant quran-based counterargument for example . 
  nothing . 
  it has to do with the 4chan / pol / perception of sweden as a ` liberal ' socialist white guilt white traitor gay4muslims paradise . 
  it has nothing to do with actual swedish sweden . 
  no recognition means the law does n't say anything about it which basically means you ca n't get married anyway . 
  a ban is explicitly `` thou shalt not '' with actual rules being written to codify it . 
  well , yes . 
  that was implied . 
  [ basically this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bible_belt_%28netherlands%29#mediaviewer/file:sgpstemmen1.png ) . 
  it 's a map of percentage of people allowed to vote who voted for the sgp which is the most hardline major christian party in politics . 
   the bible belt stretches from zeeland , through the west-betuwe and veluwe , to the northern parts of the province overijssel . 
  however , some communities with strong conservative protestant leanings are situated outside the belt . 
  for example , urk , considered by many as one of the most traditional communities in the country , and some municipalities of friesland have characteristics typical of the bible belt . 
   guess where southland is . 
  in the north !, 
  it 's lumpier too . 
  yeah okay maybe . 
  but i 'm still not sure i 'd call the country `` right-wing '' . 
  ofcourse , the whole `` right-wing/left-wing '' stuff is archaic and confusing so what do i know . 
  the netherlands are a right-wing country ? 
  it 's nicked from south park . 
  barely funny at the best of times . 
  this was not the best of times . 
  those welshies need to hump more . 
  something tells me politics ought n't be done out of spite . 
  stoer , thanks . 
  at least he 's vraiment fran\u00e7ois . 
  well my post did n't just apply to him ofcourse . 
  no dude , no . 
  the issue * is * important but the context and framework you are arguing about is very us-centric . 
  please take it elsewhere . 
  and even 40 million is n't a whole lot for a country that size . 
  it 's half of what germany has for example and less than 3 times as much as the netherlands which is * a lot * smaller . 
  yeah it does all seem a bit bad in here . 
  oh that was russia 's decision . 
  i expected it to have been a decision made by the school to bar russians or whatever due to the business in the crimea . 
  which i would n't have thought of as fair to the students . 
  fair enough man . 
  it seemed to hinge solely on equating the church with the people but fair enough . 
  hey guise , nothing personal , but it 's a bit weird you 're working out your sissy slapfight in / r/europe . 
  go to / r/politics , this topic and sort of arguing seems to be bread and butter there . 
  i mean , it 's odd enough that a subreddit with a non-specific name as `` politics '' is exclusively us-related but come on , this is / r / * europe * for crying out fuck 's sake . 
  that makes a lot more sense . 
  the headline makes it sound as if there 's an ebolapocalypse right round the corner . 
  well , got ta send them somewhere . 
  they 'd be all lost and alone in local politics . 
  just a shame the questions are n't included in that clip . 
  i also like how he includes hand movements in his italian . 
  if only . 
  \\* boks *, 
  i should start drinking lots and lots of coffee . 
  it 's still notable . 
  and if you have populations in the 60 millions it 's pretty hard to raise the number even a little bit . 
  i mean , if , say , iceland was included then it would 've been relatively easier for them to raise the amount of languages . 
  they only have a pitiful 300,000 people to educate so it 's much easier to reach them all . 
  in fact , i 'd wager iceland would score really hella high if they had been included . 
  icelandic , probably a bunch of other scandilanguages and apparently 3 % of icelanders is polish so that 's a fairly hefty impact as well . 
  true . 
  and i begrudge you your convenient position . 
  hah it even sounds similar . 
  they 're still very close though . 
  not * as * close as what they do out east with one language and two scripts but still . 
  so close in fact that i 've known quite a few frisian-speaking classmates who were better at german or even french than at english simply because of false friends and misleading similarities . 
  yeah but half a million barely makes a dent on a population of 64 million . 
  i mean , even frisian ( 470000 ) would have a much bigger impact on the dutch average ( 16-17 million ) than welsh would have . 
   english people being anti-french ? 
  and * scoring worse * than linguistically-arrogant frenchies . 
  i can say `` i do n't know '' in ten different languages , does that count ? 
  yes . 
  because this means the map is inaccurate .
