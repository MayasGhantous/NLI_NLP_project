  there was only one in which the netherlands was close to germany and this was about choosing colleagues to work with and both the netherlands and germany had 92 % of the respondents choosing based on function and skills rather than the other person 's personality . 
  the other categories were : 1 ) group versus individual `` percentage of respondents opting for individual freedom '' . 
  scores were : netherlands : 65 uk : 61 germany : 53 france : 41 uk win . 
  2 ) `` individual or group credit , which job is more frequently found in your organisation '' netherlands : 70 . 
  uk : 70 germany : 62 france : 49 . 
  3 ) individual responsibility netherlands 43 uk : 48 germany 36 france : n.a. 
  4 ) affective vs neutral , not show emotions openly at work . 
  netherlands : 46 uk : 45 germany 35 france : 30 5 ) relationships : specific vs diffuse : would you paint your boss 's house if he asked even though it has nothing to do with your normal job ? 
  percentage of respondents who would not help the boss netherlands : 91 ( !, 
  ) , uk/france 88 . 
  germany 83 . 
  the ( ! ), 
  is there because the netherlands had the highest ( shared with sweden ) percentage of respondents who would not do it . 
  6 ) should the company provide housing ? 
  percentage of respondents who disagree netherlands 83 uk 82 france 81 germany 75 . 
  7 ) achieved versus ascribed status . 
  higher the number , the more likely they 're interested in personal achievements rather than in-born or ascribed status based on age , sex , education of profession . 
  the specific question was : `` acting as suits you even if nothing is achieved '' with the qualifier `` percentage of respondents who disagree '' the specific question seems a bit different from what i 'd call `` achieved or ascribed status '' though . 
  i 'm not sure what this has to do with status . 
  anyway ; uk 56 , germany 40 , france 33 , netherlands 30 . 
  ergo , 30 % of dutch respondents say `` act as suits you even if nothing is achieved '' which i feel is different from `` i ascribe you status based on things beyond your control/achievements '' . 
  just take the fanciest one . 
  burn the others . 
  hopefully they 'll learn the lesson this time . 
   liechtenstein can , bank . 
   switzerland can , bank . 
   norway can , oil . 
   iceland can , fish ? 
  a better question would be `` sammarinese redditors , do you exist ? '', 
   ` partij voor de vrijheid ' is n't white supremacist i think but is anti islam for that matter it 's more an `` anti-thecurrentbogeyman '' party , appealing to gutfeelings . 
  putin is a fucking moron . 
   she was just under 18 so she could n't get paid for sex . 
  ergo , underage with regards to the job . 
  good point . 
  yup . 
  new zealand definitely was . 
   but if the book club did not institutionally instruct him to do so then there is not much case against them . 
  if he did it based on the tenets and ideals of the book club and in order to advance the book club , maybe it would be worth taking a look at that , yes . 
  huh , interesting/impractical . 
   in bilingual municipalities , all civil servants must have satisfactory language skill in either finnish or swedish i see it says `` either '' . 
  does this mean there could hypothetically be situations where , say , a finnish person ca n't make himself clear because there are only swedish-speaking officials available ? 
  what do the name ethnic groups signify ? 
  because it 's not often you see basque , celtic and frisian in the same category . 
  surely you mean finbreeding ? 
  haw haw haw, 
  r1b is totally better . 
  you have good taste !, 
  and we will do so by bringing stamp ** pot ** and huts ** pot ** . 
  oh wait , why do i say we . 
  i 'm not from holland . 
  hah , yeah , i saw that in a different comment later . 
  maybe even yours . 
  huh , okay . 
  [ someone else linked it in this thread ] ( http://spaceinimages.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2004/10/global_air_pollution_map_produced_by_envisat_s_sciamachy/9588991-3-eng-gb/global_air_pollution_map_produced_by_envisat_s_sciamachy.jpg ) . 
  pretty much . 
  an area of smog bigger than the entire netherlands and far more intensely awful as well . 
  [ apparently this map only shows no2 pollution ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1m5zqa/air_pollution_in_europe_mapped_by_satellite_xpost/cc66hgj ) . 
  the east of ukraine probably has a different kind of awful pollution . 
  oooooooooooh that makes more sense . 
  [ this seems pretty straightforward ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:istria.png ) . 
  i thought the ruhrgebiet was a lot more industrial and stinky than pretty much anywhere in the netherlands ? 
  is this a relative thing or what ? 
  india should be a lot worse . 
  india has some serious goddamn issues with every kind of pollution , air included . 
  edit : more confusingly , there 's some smog around the equator in africa . 
  what is up with that ? 
  burning rainforest ? 
  tertiary sector . 
  then just do n't go to scandinavia , you big silly . 
  i kinda agree although i really would n't put the uk in the same category as fenno-scandia . 
  certainly not if said scandilandia also includes the baltics . 
  i tend to give the baltics their own classification usually . 
  do n't go to sweden !, 
  beer is expensive there !, 
  i thought tuition was free in scotterland though ? 
  the netherlands is iirc something about 1400 euros a year . 
  nothing to worry about . 
  just keep soaking it . 
  except it was all perfectly legal and , at best , competition between nations . 
  a milder tax climate is not being complicit in tax evasion . 
  there was nothing corrupt about it . 
  why are you whining about this in two seperate threads ? 
  why * should n't * the subreddit allow such flairs ? 
  that 's not corruption , that 's different laws . 
  jumbo or albert heijn . 
  oh sweet , thanks . 
  what is actually the difference ? 
  they ruined scotland . 
  i 'm going to visit come october and i 'm really looking forward to it . 
  come on , you 're scottish . 
  whatever happened to the auld alliance ? 
  it 's those southern poofs who keep whinging about france . 
  then why do you feel short ? 
  that 's pretty average though . 
  god save the queen , from drowning in a soup tureen . 
  that 's adorable . 
   people might start climbing the facade to break off bits of the netherlands tulips , dingus . 
  neither politically nor factually correct . 
  come off it . 
  i like your point about electing the executive branch but i 'm not sure if i 'd actually like a president with powers similar to the us president .
