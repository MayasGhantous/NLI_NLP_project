  forced sterilisation completely ludicrous regardless of the availability of sexual reassignment surgery . 
  probably need to go either to eastern europe or far north . 
  norway would be your best bet , i guess . 
  germany schmermany . 
  they 've got yellow spots , they should n't bitch . 
  you are completely correct . 
  dutch is n't a * german * language , it 's * german *** ic ** . 
  certainly is n't a dialect of modern german which seemed implied . 
  and current standard german . 
  retain kebab on premises !, 
  is good eating !, 
  ah , i knew that trick , just did n't realise it was pertinent here . 
  most trustworthy : germany least trustworthy : greece . 
  most arrogant : britain least arrogant : germany most compassionate : no clue . 
  edit : i do n't know how formatting works !, 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  i recall having read what i mentioned before elsewhere , but i would n't know where to look for it . 
  i can see why the third point would count against our score , that 's for sure . 
  the second point , i can kinda understand either way . 
  you , as a woman , are , technically , the child 's father . 
  the problem here is as much the idea that a woman ca n't be a father as that it is that a woman is being referred to as something `` male '' . 
  i do n't know either . 
  there are some shit-horrible things we still do but afaik , the others do that too . 
  ( apparently , if you have a sex change and have some sperm in a sperm bank someplace that you might want to use after your change , you have to * destroy * that . ), 
  it looks a bit iffy here though . 
  i 'm curious what the explanation is , but that 's the problem with just showing a map ofcourse . 
   glorious piece . 
  that settles it . 
  i 'm a cakosexual . 
  i do n't want to marry it though . 
  i just want to give into perverted lust and devour it . 
  not only a complete asshole , he 's also incompetent at his crime . 
  i 'm double dissappointed in my fellow countryman . 
  i did n't cherrypick anything . 
  the second part was just for fun . 
  it 's just that english is descended from earlier germanic languages . 
  and no matter how many non-germanic affectations it may have , that 's what it is . 
  if your child started hanging out more with the neighbours than with you , would that mean you were n't related anymore ? 
  i 'd hope not , that would be silly . 
  dutch does have * some * non-european speakers though . 
  indonesia , south africa , suriname could all throw a spanner in your clandestine works . 
  you 'll want a language like letzebuergisch or frisian . 
  it 's germanic . 
  the basic things are and that 's why it 's classified as such . 
  eating , sleeping , drinking , doing , making ( pissing , shitting ) are obviously germanic . 
  after ( germanic ) that ( ger ) , english ( ger ) does ( g ) become ( g ) a ( g ) hodge-podge ( french ) of ( germanic ) different ( latin ) languages ( fr ) though ( ger ) , agreed . 
   the dutch like their cheese - well i do n't . 
   accusation acquisition , surely ? 
  well said though . 
  well , maybe it 's about damn time . 
  bah , it 's not as if the dutch entries would suddenly become non-awful then . 
  oh interesting . 
  would 've been cool though . 
  ah , addendum to the different post . 
  i asked my teacher . 
  sorry , no , it does n't mean hunger . 
  soviet russia had a different name in the first place and `` e guo '' was already used for tsarist russia apparently . 
  hah , i 'd be surprised if this would pop up . 
  god brave the savery . 
  even if ying means hero rather than brave , yinggu\u00f3 does n't mean brave country . 
  literally , maybe , but the name is partially phonetic . 
  okidoki , i asked some things although not specifically * why * there are different methods . 
  there just are . 
  some countries get partial phonetic transliteration ( anything ending in gu\u00f3 ) and some get full phonetic thrown at them . 
  afraid it does n't actually mean that . 
  it 's just partial phonetics + suffix meaning country . 
  ying from eng . 
  just like de from deutsch , fa from france and mei from america . 
  further clarification ( level of dissappointment up to you ) ; great britain * is * y\u012bng gu\u00f3 . 
  eng-country/england . 
  * however * , `` england '' is `` y\u012bngg\u00e9l\u00e1n '' . 
  [ according to ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1dv30w/literal_translations_of_chinese_names_for/c9ubvov ) / u/danumjak , scotland is s\u016b g\u00e9 l\u00e1n . 
  which is again phonetic . 
  so , yes , the uk is named after england . 
  but scotland still has its own name . 
  similarily , the netherlands as a whole is named after holland but the province i 'm from apparently still does have its own name . 
  also , i just asked my teacher . 
  i forgot to ask about scotland and wales but you 're correct about y\u012bngg\u00e9l\u00e1n . 
  y\u012bngg\u00e9l\u00e1n is england but y\u012bng gu\u00f3 , from the same phonetic name is the uk . 
  i doubt it 's * only * used for tsarist russia as my teacher still uses that name . 
  she 's not quite old enough to have come here before the commies took over , so i 'm going to assume that that is the word she learned . 
  thing is , i asked her today ( not even an hour ago . ), 
  there 's no real system , as far as she knows , behind naming countries . 
  which means there 's a bunch of different ways it 's done . 
  some countries are done phonetically ( h\u00e9 l\u00e1n , a\u00ec \u011br l\u00e1n , b\u014d l\u00e1n ) some countries , ( fa guo , de guo , ying guo , mei guo ) are a combination of partial phonetics ( fa for france , de for deutschland , ying for england , mei for america ) and a word for `` country '' . 
  she thought `` e guo '' would fit in with that format and that the `` e '' would be based on the russian word for russia but that does n't really work as russia is basically pronounced russia in russian . 
  so even if the country is now eluosi , that still does n't explain the `` e '' , although it is more phonetic . 
  hah yeah , all true too . 
  pretty amusing . 
  [ what this guy is saying sounds plausible ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1dv30w/literal_translations_of_chinese_names_for/c9uf6c9 ) . 
  i 'll see if i can ask a few things though . 
  apparently quite tricky . 
  oh , interesting . 
  that sounds amusingly plausible , yes . 
  haha , yeah . 
  i had n't thought of it like that . 
  i think english simply got theword from greek via latin and that the other languages got it via interaction with the macedonians and the byzantines or something like that . 
  okay , cool . 
  i did n't know those yet . 
  yep , good point .
