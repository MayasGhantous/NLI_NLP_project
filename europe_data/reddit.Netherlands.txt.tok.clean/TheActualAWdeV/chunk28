  i did n't think of it like that yet , but seems entirely correct . 
  oh , could be . 
  i 'm at a really basic level and the word has n't really been relevant yet . 
  could be you 're right although i find it a bit difficult to believe . 
  and ? 
  i 'm not saying their * flag * is a symbol of commies , i 'm saying * red * is . 
  yeah , but i was n't really referring to a single city . 
  just the area . 
  everything is in the area and that these cities compete matters little . 
  none of the cities is unambiguously dominant ; holland is . 
  oh awesome !, 
  i did not know that !, 
  cool !, 
  although the translation for wales sounds a bit iffy . 
  i think the netherlands would be a better example . 
  everything is in north-holland , south-holland and a few things in utrecht . 
  the rest ? 
  generally dismissed as yokels . 
  was this always the case ? 
  nope . 
  holland ( both united ) had always been a powerhouse , yes , but not quite as exclusively so . 
  well , it 's : l\u0101 tu\u014d we\u00ed y\u00e0 according to the site i linked in the previous post . 
  as you can see it 's pretty much phonetic ( the first two words have an accent that makes the tone flat , the third rising and the fourth going down ) . 
  it just so happens that the words used to represent the sounds ( in a way a mandarin speaker could use ) are also used in different words which have different meanings . 
  looking at [ this ] ( http://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=%e6%8b%96 ) , it seems that tu\u014d can mean `` pull '' . 
  amazingly enough , [ the second word ] ( http://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=l%c4%81 ) , l\u0101 , can * also * mean `` pull '' . 
  according to the second definition there . 
  i think the other two words then do n't really mean anything and op or whoever made it added them back because it 's more amusing and also because it 's part of the word in english . 
  or maybe it does mean something but was ignored for some reason . 
  so sorry dude . 
  i feel kind of bad now . 
  do n't worry , it 's not as if it 's the only place that gets mislabeled all the time . 
  i 'm going to ( slightly gleefully ) dissappoint you with my own theory : the country is called `` y\u012bng gu\u00f3 '' . 
  gu\u00f3 is obvious , it means land . 
  so they call your country `` y\u012bngland '' ... with a pretty flat i in it . 
  i know what the country is called . 
  i also know what my own country is called , but the chinese ( and everyfuckingbody else ) call it something different . 
  they use h\u00e9 l\u00e1n ( phonetic holland ) for the entirety of the netherlands and use a combination of phonetics ( ying ) + the word for land `` gu\u00f3 '' . 
  unless they actually think the british are spectacularily brave ( which i ca n't really imagine in the context of british technological superiority in the opium wars ) , it 's likely to simply be a phonetic interpretation of `` eng '' . 
  as in , england . 
  that 's what my second paragraph was about by the way . 
  could be . 
  they 've been pretty close for a long time ( physically that is ) so i imagine it then makes sense to use the word they use for their own country `` zh\u014dng ** gu\u00f3 ** '' ( middle country ) and apply it to a different one then . 
  i should figure out what the \u00e9 in \u00e9 gu\u00f3 ( russia ) means . 
  or even if it means anything . 
  although i did just find there 's apparently also a different word for russia : [ \u00e9 lu\u00f3 s\u012b ] ( http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_names_in_chinese.htm#r ) which is a lot more phonetic although i still do n't know what the \u00e9 signifies . 
  oh sure , could be . 
  you know what , i should write this shit down and ask my teacher tomorrow . 
  heh , wow , i would never have figured that out . 
  thanks !, 
  heh , pretty similar here . 
  closest bet might be het waddengebied . 
  haha . 
  yes , they used the names phonetically . 
  even ukraine , just remember the r is n't as distinct in chinese as you might be used to . 
  could be . 
  although poland or ukraine are n't really small countries . 
  and i would 've thought the netherlands had had opportunity to properly introduce themselves although maybe they did n't . 
  too busy in deshima , i guess . 
  no , catalonia is the * english * name . 
  catalu\u00f1a is the one given by the evil evil oppressor spain !, 
  those are hofstede 's dimensions !, 
  yeah , slightly different but they do tell tales . 
  nice find !, 
  i even somehow figured out the abbreviations on my own fairly quickly . 
  except for uncertainty avoidance . 
   b\u014d l\u00e1n the \u014d means it 's a long flat `` o '' and l\u00e1n should be fairly self-explanatory . 
  it 's a phonetic name which means something rather silly in chinese . 
  are you still in belgium then ? 
  it probably does n't mean anything . 
  few of them do . 
  the names are written down in a sort of phonetic way which ends up coinciding with completely different words in chinese . 
  although , on second thought , it seems sweden * is n't * one of the phonetical names . 
  it 's ru\u00ec di\u01cen . 
  the names were used phonetically as well as literally . 
  slovakia is apparently `` si1 luo4 fa2 ke4 '' the numbers indicate the kind of accent that 's on the words . 
  siluo might not have gotten translated because maybe it is n't anything and apparently `` fa ke '' means cut gram . 
  or rather `` fa '' is cut and `` ke '' is gram . 
  maybe the other way around . 
  and commienism . 
  this is pretty silly . 
  why are england , germany and france ( ying guo , de guo and fa guo ) translated as land and why is n't russia ? 
  russia is e guo ( cba to do the damned accents ) . 
  i do n't know what e is but guo still means land . 
  at least write it as `` russia-land '' or `` rus-land '' or `` e-land '' . 
  and yes , i said england there . 
  not the uk . 
  why ? 
  because that 's what mandarin does . 
  calls it ying guo . 
  which is basically `` yingland '' . 
  should be pretty obvious why it sounds that way . 
  similarily , the netherlands is `` he lan '' , named after , as usual holland . 
  i asumme then that `` lan '' means orchid and that ireland or finland also have a similar `` lan '' sound , although i could n't say why they use two different standards for the same term `` land '' . 
  sometimes it becomes `` guo '' which still means land and sometimes it apparently becomes lan . 
  edit : my [ hunch was correct . 
  ] ( http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_names_in_chinese.htm ) the orchid countries : netherlands = lotus orchid . 
  h\u00e9 l\u00e1n ireland = love your orchid . 
  a\u00ec \u011br l\u00e1n finland = orchid fragrance . 
  f\u0113n l\u00e1n poland = wave orchid .
