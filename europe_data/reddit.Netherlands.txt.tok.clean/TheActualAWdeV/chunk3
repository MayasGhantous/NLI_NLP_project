  although it would probably bump us up to at most 3.3 , it 's still a slightly smaller difference between the netherlands on the map now and luxembourg . 
  if you had * any * sense beyond `` hurrr luk at him being nationalistic '' you would 've realised this too damnit !, 
  uh-huh . 
  nothing to do with your own content idleness . 
  everyone else has to cater to you . 
  and this finally proves my suspicions ; even the allegedly arrogant and linguistically limited french * speak more languages * than the brits . 
  i hope they counted frisian . 
  what 's this sweden ? 
  not included in the nordic jerk ? 
  netherlands stronk . 
  makes sense . 
  and my sentence `` they 're keeping mexicans out '' is a bit more crudely put than i intended . 
  makes sense . 
  still could n't name any of them . 
  i think the bigger problem here is that meidei chose to willfully misinterpret `` church of cyprus '' as `` cypriots '' . 
  i think mr romano is reaching . 
  269 is not the same as 255 and neither is 646 the same as 649 . 
  same . 
  i also knew the sami must have had their own language even if i did n't know what it was called . 
   an upvote is not an agreemant button . 
  it usually is . 
   we have lived here for tens of thousands of years . 
  i 've lived here for slightly less than 25 . 
  i 'm not * that * old . 
  dude , weak . 
  who says american isolationism is okay ? 
  which isolationism even ? 
  they 're keeping mexicans out , yeah , but it 's not like you have anyone on reddit saying * that * 's okay . 
  let alone in / r/europe . 
  do n't be a wanker . 
  bollocks . 
  lame trite bollocks . 
  ah makes sense . 
  oh no doubt they have those things . 
  but they do n't have the same `` do n't fuck with us '' effect as russia 's `` we have the largest stockpile of nukes in the world '' . 
  i 'm not saying he 'd * use * them but the mere fact that he has three thousand of them makes people rather careful about getting into fisticuffs with russia . 
  ah , makes sense . 
  thanks . 
  well yes . 
  he also has nukes however . 
  i like the music . 
  yeah , what 's the actual name of the currency ? 
  glad someone does . 
   most people are up by 07:00 . 
  school starts in germany at 08:00 . 
  on saturday ? 
  that 's prime sleeping-in time and then some chucklefuck starts mowing his lawn . 
  armenia big . 
  though the horses are okay . 
  it says `` geen '' not `` green '' . 
  would be weird if it said `` green '' though as that would 've been the only word in english on the map . 
   there 're more armeninans living in russia than in armenia itself . 
  in other news , armenia invades russia and annexes everything up to and including moscow . 
  you could make one hell of a phalanx with 30 % of 11 million . 
  not being allowed to eat a creature because it 's been whacked over the eat seems a bit silly to me too . 
  sounds like a hassle to me . 
  huh okay . 
  thanksfor clarifying , i forgot about the senate . 
  a veterinarian to do a mercy-killing though ? 
  interesting idea . 
   but the europe downvote brigade is just pathetic . 
  to be fair , so is the comment . 
  apparently the ban is not so much `` no more halal/kosher '' but rather `` stun them first ffs '' . 
  iirc , the netherlands is also doing that already . 
  or was discussing it a while ago anyway . 
  pah . 
  stonecutters are better . 
  they even have their own [ theme song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zi_aealije ) . 
  yeah that seems to pretty much be it . 
  huh interesting . 
  does sound like the kind of construction intended to obfuscate people out of their money though . 
  it does look a bit like sour grapes , you have to admit . 
  true and it was just as silly then as this is now . 
  i 'm glad the nation grew out of that . 
  i do n't think fyrom * can * claim any historical ties with alexander though . 
  only location but i do n't think that 's super significant . 
  if i start proclaiming i was bantu i 'd get a few raised eyebrows my way too . 
  hm , interesting . 
  i 'm not sure if i 'd want to bother with all the hassle though . 
  :p what does cash back entail though ? 
  you get money for spending ? 
  if you 'd ask people about `` fox '' here you 'd probably end up with people mentioning either that shitty song or the new foot-y-bally tv-channel . 
  neither the news channel nor animals . 
   they would n't fuck the map up on purpose they fuck everything * else * up on purpose though . 
   this would n't happen in my country . 
  sweden is notoriously lacking in palm-lined beaches , yeah . 
  he presumably still * looks * persian which is more than enough for your average slavering nutjob neo-nazi to shout slurs at you , regardless of whether you practice the faith or not . 
  same in the netherlands . 
  it has the added benefit of being your own money so you do n't pay interest or any kind of fees . 
  in fact , the banl pays * you * interest because you keep your money at their bank . 
  the only time you have to pay interest is if you go into debt , just like any other debt . 
  i did n't know bikini bottom was that densely populated . 
  derp , makes sense . 
  my bad . 
  ofcourse not . 
  the first men , the andals and the rhoynar . 
  they were at war with the uk in 1939 ? 
  that 's not what anyone is saying but good jerb taking the comment the worst possible way , you self-righteous wanker . 
  well , `` food '' ... 
  still though , they can be tasty if you 're hungry and want something warm-ish .
