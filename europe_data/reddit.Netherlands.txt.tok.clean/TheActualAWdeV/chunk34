  i could not agree more . 
  my only quibble is the rather ... optimistic `` mother tongue plus two '' scheme . 
  chocolatey cereal in milk . 
  very cold milk , almost frozen . 
  added a banana to it this morning . 
  i 'm here !, 
  looks like a good one too . 
  similar with dutch . 
  schat = treasure and can be used to speak about your wife/husband/girl - / boyfriend or a literal treasure . 
  moreover , `` schatkist '' is both the word for the treasury/the nation 's finances and literally means `` treasure chest '' . 
  not entirely . 
  you can still see islandy bits in zeeland and directly above that are the provinces of south and north holland . 
  that 's the 7 million large randstad spread over 8,287 km2 . 
  the \u00cele-de-france area is 12 million people over 12,012 km2 . 
  obviously , the density in the \u00cele-de-france area is still greater but they 're pretty close in that regard . 
  wikipedia says the flemish diamond is more something like 5 mil than 7 though . 
  this all sounds a bit dramatic . 
  whatever floats your boat , i guess . 
  i doubt there 's an omg warrrr going on though . 
  true , but it was n't very eggciting . 
  [ now in video form ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdclamqdcf0 ) . 
   so you guys in europe do n't keep your eggs in the fridge after you buy them like we do ? 
  i do . 
  so did my family . 
  they 're unrefrigerated in the stores though , that 's true . 
  and i was wondering why my upstairs neighbour keeps his eggs out in our kitchen all the time . 
  somehow , i never made the connection that if they 're not cooled in the stores they do n't necessarily need to be coolded in house either . 
  this article was very informative . 
  never occured to me that vaccinating chickens might be a good idea for healthy eggs . 
  yeah , i think it 's just distance that does a good enough job of creating differences . 
  peter , you ca n't speak italian just because you have a moustache . 
   for a small country denmark has a ton of dialects , which might be the result of some isolation due to the country consisting of a lot of islands . 
  i 'm not sure about the last part . 
  [ look at this patchwork map of dutch dialects ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/niederl%c3%a4ndische_dialekte.png ) . 
  i do n't think it 's islands that 's to blame here , it 's just that there 's a lot of history and distances too great to regularily cross before the advent of the car or train . 
  edit : the legend for the map uses a strange combination of dutch and german with some typo 's in dutch words . 
  it 's not `` gronnings-noorddrents '' but it 's '' * gronings * - noorddrents '' and it 's not `` stellingsverfs '' , it 's `` stelling ** w ** erfs '' . 
  haha , i was also thinking of [ this shit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_cheese ) . 
  i know the us has better cheeses ( vermont supposedly ) but i never see them mentioned anywhere . 
  yeah , i think that 's exactly it . 
  officiality . 
  frisian speakers are n't very numerous but it * is * recognised officially ; so * tsiis * makes an appearance . 
  edit : then again . 
  i 'm not so sure about the status of pretty much all the celtic variants . 
   americans like cheese too , right ? 
  looking at what they pass off as `` cheese '' , i would n't say that . 
  heh , that one 's amusing . 
  it says catholics were technically the biggest minority in 1930 already though . 
  i either had a wrong timeframe in mind or the fear i was thinking of was that they 'd become a * majority * instead of the biggest minority . 
  i do n't know . 
   jokes aside , i would appreciate that source if you can find it . 
  i 'd appreciate it too but it 's difficult . 
  :p i now have half a dozen tabs open on semi-relevant things but it 's incredibly difficult to sift through the politically-laden stuff and actually find a source . 
  i did find a [ report ] ( http://www.scp.nl/dsresource?objectid=33077&amp;type=org ) by the scp ( sociaal en cultureel planbureau/social and cultural planning bureau ) on the subject but i 'm not sure if it 's relevant and neither do i know if it proves me wrong or right . 
  regardless of what the conclusion is , the word report at the beginning of this paragraph should be a link which initiates download for a . pdf file . 
  i 'm afraid i ca n't really recall how i got there as it was a bit of a roundabout way . 
  i 'm still reading through it though as it is 203 pages long . 
  i 'll probably continue tomorrow as i 'm tired and sleepy . 
  the reasoning behind what i saw previously ( the source i ca n't find ) was talking about how those numbers would decline not due to any change in religiosity but rather due to improved education ( especially effective if it was education for women ) , better access to birth control methods and a different situation in which it would n't be as important to have as many children . 
  i hope this is of any use . 
  hehe yep . 
  situation is ofcourse slightly different but i still do n't think nations will be toppled and turned into sharia-states . 
   well , the catholics did manage to become the largest religious group in the netherlands . 
  really ? 
  and then what happened ? 
  did they forcefully convert everyone to catholicism ? 
  has the nation fallen into anarchy ? 
  or do they have just as little political clout as any of the other religions ? 
   and do you have a source on the growth rate of muslims slowing down in the netherlands ? 
  been a while , i did have one . 
  i 'll need to do some serious pondering/googling but i 'll get back to you on that . 
  thanks . 
  i like it too . 
  yeah , that 's pretty bad . 
  thanks bruv . 
  they really should pay their electricity on time , then it would n't go dark . 
  too bad it 's gone now . 
  thank you , person who could be everybody except for the current bundeskanzlerin . 
  i was going to mention this too ; the growth rate wo n't keep up . 
  it 's already smaller than it was , atleast over here in the netherlands . 
  moreover , this was the exact same shit that was spouted here about the catholics not too long ago . 
  they did n't take over either and that despite their families producing on average twice as many children as non-catholic families of the day . 
  haha maybe you could pick it up in no time . 
  i 'm still intimidated by schwyzerd\u00fctsch though . 
  i do like that clip though , i like her pronunciation and explanation . 
  nah man , we all get them from eastern europe and the balkans anyway . 
  more practical if you bring them . 
  we can bring weed . 
  the dutch are big on equality . 
  it 's good for trade . 
  flipside is tall poppy syndrome and the attitude of `` acting normal is crazy enough '' . 
  yes , the link from the other swiss person up there in this thread included something which did sound like a proper `` g '' . 
  mind you , frisians up north have a g more similar to that in english ( as the two are very close ) and the southern dutch have more of a `` zj '' sound . 
  haha damn . 
  allright , thanks for explaining . 
  that 's really silly . 
  what 's the rationale behind that ? 
  do they not keep archives ? 
  haha , i was refering to [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/18fwb6/swedens_9000_missing_horses_baffle_experts/c8eliih ) . 
  that 's the one .
