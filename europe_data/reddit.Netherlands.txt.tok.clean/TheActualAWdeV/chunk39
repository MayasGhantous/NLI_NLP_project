  i strongly doubt this is national policy or that you can somehow extrapolate it to `` the british '' , in the same way that i do n't think you can take the scum who did it and proclaim them to be `` the muslims '' . 
  [ seems exactly that to me ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mgkd1/another_italian_woman_raped_by_a_migrant/cvern1d ) . 
   but my point was why ? 
  because he wants to . 
  big fucking deal . 
   i rarely see anyone do it besides the french though . 
  liar . 
  you do n't see `` the french '' do it , you see dclauzel do it . 
  only one who does it with any kind of regularity , get off your high horse and stop your baseless generalising accusations . 
  some people occassionally do it too but people just usually do n't give enough of a shit and especially longer posts are n't worth the effort . 
  he does n't think everyone speaks french dingus , * that 's why he posts everything twice * . 
  presumably because he likes it . 
  nobody ever claimed that he is a perfect mod who never censored anything ever , people are just saying that * if * he is trying to cover everything up then he 's doing a pretty shit job of it . 
   all 100 % legit i do n't . 
  500 ` people ' is easy as hell and they only need 9 comments each on average for your numbers . 
  ( spam ) bots , ban evaders , trolls , brigadiers from wherever , probably adds up pretty quickly . 
  i mean , maybe i 'm wrong , but we really ca n't tell whether this is extraordinary or not without comparing it to similar pictures from earlier on . 
  yes as you can clearly see everyone here has been sent to a virtual gulag and the thread is nowhere to be found , you clearly are actually as much a victim as you like to claim you are . 
  damn you dclauzel , damn you !, 
  then you have a list of isolated events that still do not make much of an impact seeing as this concerns millions of people . 
  which are an uncommon type of rape in the first place . 
  most common rapes are relational rapes or even people in the victim 's own family . 
  what you just said sounds very dramatic , but i 'm not sure if it 's actually significant . 
  how * many * of those rapes are the for example ? 
  100 % is easy if there 's just one for example . 
  the keyword used here was ` prevent ' . 
  none of those things prevent horrible people from doing horrible things so it 's absurd to complain that there is no way of preventing horrible people without papers from doing horrible things . 
  oh please as if the hints were in any way subtle . 
  we all know who the supposed baddy here is . 
  it 's obvious the hospital staff did so out of fear of offending some random muslim dickweed . 
  however , they did this pre-emptively , out of their own choice , and no offence was actually caused . 
  can we even really * blame * muslims for being `` offended '' if in this case the offence has n't had chance to materialise in the first place ? 
  this clumsy disrespect is not something you can directly pin on muslims in the uk but maybe rather on the hospital 's ( british ? ), 
  problem-avoidance culture ? 
  maybe this culture has come to be or been influenced by previous altercations , because elsewhere in the thread someone mentioned something similar has happened before . 
  but if that is the case , what * exactly * happened before ? 
  were there actually muslims kicking up a ruckus ? 
  were they dickheads who happened to be muslim ? 
  were they perhaps not muslim at all but rather some other type of dickhead ? 
  was it someone offended * on behalf of muslims * while not actually representing them in any way ? 
  i mean , `` twice already , uk soldiers forced to move by muslims '' sounds totally hella dramatic but i strongly doubt this is actually quite so straight forward . 
  i want thin potato slices with more salt than actual potato . 
  quit bitching about the name . 
  fricking natzees . 
   with the difference that napoleon actually had some tactical sense . 
  and did n't murder millions of civilians on purpose all willy-nilly . 
  another difference is that napoleon * [ emancipated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_emancipation ) * rather than murdered the jews . 
  i know , i know , nit-picking , but i feel like such a small gesture should still count . 
  me neither but as long as they 're not too stupid i can deal with it . 
  the horrible anus was nasty , but being occupied by either the spanish , the french or worst of all the nazi 's ca n't have been much better than that . 
  getting attacked on 4 sides , nasty . 
  occupied & extorted by the nazi 's who cart off tens of thousands of people and when they 're finally gone twenty thousand more people starve to death in a super-nasty winter ? 
  that 's nastier . 
  well , report it and see what happens . 
  maybe they did n't notice . 
  i did n't . 
  i vaguely remembered the name but not why anymore . 
  language sure , but culture ? 
  whatchu talking ` bout ? 
  i thought that one was in euros too . 
  i doubt that . 
  he 'd appoint one petty warlord and all the others would fight over lybia 's smoldering corpse anyway . 
  nothing new . 
  it was 10 % more expensive in / r/thenetherlands . 
  but you can hardly blame someone for what the nebulous group `` people '' hallucinated that person may have said . 
  retard . 
  dubious , this is a waste of ink . 
   the new law on immigration allows the government to use the military in a migratory crisis . 
  oh yeah that 's gon na work out juuuust fricking dandy . 
   the fuck fancy name do i get for shagging on a train ?!, 
  ` sleazebag ' has a certain ring to it . 
  merkel seems to put a lot of thought into everything so presumably she has put thought into this as well . 
  professor anthony glees a hypocrite hack spewing emotionally-laden buzzwords - me . 
   but clauzel can remove anything that dares to suggest multiculturalism is n't 100 % perfect ; if this is what he 's actually doing then he 's doing a lousy job of it , seeing as the place is still positively flooded with posts about immigration . 
  so i 'm gon na wager there is something else going on here and that you are n't nearly as big a victim as you 're pretending here . 
   but lately it 's really been getting out of hand . 
  `` lately '' he has hardly been posting . 
  pretty sure i have n't seen any post of him in the past few weeks if not month . 
  i 'm sure the german party is super-relevant to a poster who routinely gets whined at for posting in french ... 
   save every new post , and refresh regularly better idea ; get a life . 
  `` censorship '' my hairy ass . 
   a maltese eu official is being investigated for allegedly beating an italian woman with a mussolini plaque during an `` anti-semitic rant '' outside the brussels headquarters the amusing irony ofcourse being that maltese is a semitic language , and the only one recognised as an official language of the eu hohohoho, 
  i 'm still not sure if that was wat op meant . 
  i was thinking of actual pairs of refugees instead of `` women and children combined make up 25 % of the total '' . 
  what i understood left a lot of room for children without accompanying women or vice versa . 
  i interpreted it as `` woman + child combinations form 25 % of total asylum seekers '' . 
  the closest neighbouring safe country is safe enough for a temporary stay , yes . 
  i mean , i ca n't exactly blame anyone trying to get far away from shitholes . 
  it 's not good for us and risky as hell for them but i ca n't blame them . 
  i ca n't really disagree on account of having gotten something like 1.3 liters of guinness for basically free and having a kick-ass view to enjoy it from . 
  though it 's not the most culturally refined or picture-appropriate place . 
   it was merkels statement that syrians would not be deported from germany that started the wave of migrants , and the image of german people welcoming them with cheers and presents . 
  they were already coming at that point and they were already going everywhere else too . 
  merkel can say anything she wants and they 'll basically just keep coming . 
  they * are * going to any other place at a comparable level to germany . 
  they go to france , the uk , sweden , danmark , the netherlands . 
  i 'd like a source as to where you get the `` vast majority only want to go to germany '' because that is certainly not the impression i 'm getting from every other thread in / r/europe . 
   sure as hell was n't hungary that created this situation in syria , iraq , nor afghanistan and nobody was saying that . 
  the point of / u/t0t0zenerd seems to rather be that germany is * not * responsible for the fucked-up situation in the middle east , just like hungary is n't responsible for it . 
  orban still does not sound reasonable .
