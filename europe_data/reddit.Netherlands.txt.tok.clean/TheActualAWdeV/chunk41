  presumably there are also a few social skills involved . 
  not if you oppose prostitution and sex work on the basis that it is innately exploitative of women . 
  which i 've seen self-described feminists argue . 
  just because there is no active war does n't mean it is safe . 
  political refugees are a thing you know . 
  could vary from anyone acting or speaking out against the regime to anyone who fears for their life because of their sexual attraction . 
  slightly too humanising bro . 
  ducklings do n't know shit and neither do adult ducks . 
  they 're not gon na think `` i 've got to get out of there '' , you 're just projecting emotions on them . 
  awesome !, 
  i wanted to check but did n't really know how to search for that . 
  oh really ? 
  they 're not very common here . 
  not in this city at least . 
  it 's also really close to my university ( sort of university ) as well as having lots of water and greenery around it , with a nice neighbourhood and you could moor your own boat close by . 
  oh yeah i know it 's mostly belgian . 
  i 'm just saying the few in the netherlands quite good too . 
  also , neat . 
  a shame they do n't brew trappist beers anymore in france . 
  they might 've been able to add a certain something . 
  that 's the joke . 
  roger . 
  but we were talking about birds here . 
  not really i think . 
  the netherlands has two or three of them , i do n't think france has a trappist brewery . 
  although maybe kazakhstan is within that radius . 
  i like the way it looks , i like that every apartment has one of those sort-of-balcony things , i like the location and the area ( not clear from the picture ) . 
  and an apartment there is a lot cheaper than i thought it would be . 
  not sure i 'd want to live there though . 
  place seemed a bit dreary . 
  especially in winter . 
  independent , semi-independent dwelling or floor of a building , varying from 75 square meters to 178 square meters . 
  also at least one houseboat and an apartment in a [ quite neat building ] ( http://imganuncios.mitula.net/taco_van_der_veenplein_83_8923em_leeuwarden_8970052426031749569.jpg ) . 
  the trappists are great . 
  no , we just sanitize the baby . 
  that sure showed us . 
   since bek also means beak does it ? 
  lots of animals have a bek but those that have beaks always have those beaks called `` snavel '' . 
  it 's a very rude war you know . 
  first we need to gang up on the brits , i think . 
  and then later they 'll have a civil war , and the losers will keep whining `` the moon will rise again !, 
  it 's a youtube link to ( part of ) a south park episode . 
  not even the best part of the episode because i could n't find that/didn ' t know what to search for exactly . 
  but go you for taking a bold stand against my forcing links on people all willy-nilly !, 
  [ do n't underestimate it !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nerblbkdbvo ), 
  i agree with you , but the sticky thread does need actual updating if it 's supposed to serve its purpose . 
  i do n't think it was made with the intent to hinder . 
  i think it was made with the intent to stop the whole front page of / r/europe to be filled with immigration-related threads . 
  but i do think the implementation was bad and that it should have been actually managed . 
  a filter would have been better , i guess . 
  i do not however believe immigration is anywhere near as big a problem as you claim it is and i do think you 're being a bit of a drama queen about this . 
   it will never be a cosy echo chamber for ` progressives ' , no it 's a cosy echo chamber for some rather focused individuals instead . 
  i just looked at the page you linked . 
  literally * everything * is about `` dem damn immigrunts ! '', 
  these people are staring themselves blind on the same issue !, 
  the only thing that was n't about immigration was a meta thread mocking a moderator elsewhere over something related to immigration !, 
  well , they are . 
  they 're just also deeply commited to cutting costs where costs should n't be cut so people wo n't notice their extravagances so much . 
  no i got that . 
  i was just making the additional point that if you do n't speak a language , it all becomes a blur of sounds and tones and sometimes you hear something semi-familiar but that 's more due to human pattern recognition than due to the person actually * saying * something like that . 
  a sort of verbal pareidolia as it were . 
  does n't most of swedish vaguely sound like that if you do n't speak swedish anyway ? 
  and i 'm sure you can back that up with any thing other than your own prejudice . 
  some places in the us [ get quite close ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/nones_by_state_2014_%28pew_research_religious_landscape_study%29.png ) . 
  `` nones '' here being `` what religion do you have - none '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irreligion_in_the_united_states#tables but yeah , i agree that the japanese , and east asia in general , have different religions than those practiced in the americas , europe , africa and the middle-east/southwest asia . 
  most of those are abrahamic religions and i kinda get the impression they 're a bit more . . touchy . 
  sensitive . 
  explosive . 
  more so than the indian religions and certainly more than the east asian ones but my perspective is limited and quite possibly incredibly wrong there too . 
  ironically , japan has had religious terrorist attacks based on a cult that revolved around some rather [ fucked-up ideas on christianity mixed with buddhism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aum_shinrikyo ) . 
   and largely cultural . 
  i think the numbers in europe might be a bit skewed because of that too . 
  they might not actually * believe * but they might still identify themselves as catholic . 
  i think the spanish and the polish have some of that and [ ireland definitely seems to have some of that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0123r6vjioe ) . 
  and , well , shucks . 
  i would n't say it was well-written , i just plonked down some wikipedia links and rambled a bit about them . 
  seems to not be true , according to some simple snooping on wikipedia . 
  there are a few mosques in japan and japan has enshrined freedom of religion in its [ constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_japan#individual_rights_.28articles_10.e2.80.9340.29 ) . 
  fifth under ` other guarantees ' . 
   mostly non religious too - something us in the west should consider !, 
  i 'm sorry , what west are you talking about ? 
   [ less than 40 % of the population of japan identifies with an organised religion  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_japan#irreligion ) . 
  which puts it in-between [ germany and latvia and above the uk , belgium , france , the netherlands , the nordic countries , estonia , the czech republic and some eastern-european countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_atheism#europe ) . 
  and 40 % is in fact not a whole lot less than germany , switzerland , austria , luxembourg or hungary and only a mere 11 % below the eu-average . 
  with the added notes that sometimes religion is more of a cultural identifier rather than any actual belief . 
   japan has banned all muslim activity in its country extremely dubious . 
  japan does not collect information on religion but it does [ stipulate freedom of religion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_japan#individual_rights_.28articles_10.e2.80.9340.29 ) . 
  there are some [ mosques ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kobe_mosque ) in japan as well . 
  and anyway , it 's not as if japan is [ free from religious extremists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aum_shinrikyo ) or [ terrorist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tokyo_subway_sarin_attack ) [ attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matsumoto_incident ) . 
  yep . 
  the brits . 
  bitching and moaning about the germans and accusing them of every vileness under the sun is okay but how dare anyone mention that brits are fucking scum as tourists . 
  [ unfortunately peanutbutter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pieter_jelles_troelstra ) . 
  miii ? 
  i am today so j\u00e4ttehappy , i sing tralala ? 
  i do n't think that applies to the public at large but rather to institutes , no ? 
  hey man that shit is just not true . 
  german tourists go * everywhere * .
