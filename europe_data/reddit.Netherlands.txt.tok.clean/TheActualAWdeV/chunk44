  i do not find cultural , religious or aesthetic reasons strong enough to do these things and so the same reasons for not allowing fgm or , i do n't know , sharpening 's children 's ears to make them look more elvish apply here . 
  wikipedia even makes the claim that there is a belief in some african community that fgm is * more hygienic * but i 'm afraid i ca n't help you to the source as it is behind a 44 $ paywall and i have therefore not read it myself and will ignore it . 
  so i 'm afraid i 'm not convinced , sorry . 
  i appreciate it . 
  it 's neither old nor from amsterdam though and i 'm not too sure if it 's even cheese . 
  a lot of land is mostly just good for grass or sometimes potatoes . 
  the grassy bits are obviously very useful for pasturing cattle on . 
  does that count as unemployed though ? 
  they 're not though . 
  the foreskin protects and lubricates the glans penis and the appendix is supposed to play a role in your immune system or as a safe house for gut flora . 
  but i feel like there 's a difference between stating `` both are functionless '' and `` removing one or the other is equivalent '' too . 
  even * if * they are functionless , does that warrant removal without good reason ? 
  worse yet , there is * always * a risk in doing surgery . 
  infections , excessive bleeding , damage to things that were n't supposed to be damaged which [ has lead to some shit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_reimer ) . 
  in fact i 'd argue that the * removal * is functionless outside of medical emergencies . 
  which leads me to think of it as such ; - functionless . 
  - every surgery carries risk . 
  - non-consensual to me , that adds up to `` do n't fucking do it '' . 
  ... why was there any need for circumcision in the first place ? 
  i mean , i can understand prefering circumcision while under narcosis over having it hacked off with a rusty cleaver while you 're awake and conscious but i still do n't see why it needed to happen in the first place . 
  wait a minute . 
  no it is n't . 
  the appendix does n't get removed all willy-nilly , it only gets removed when there 's a risk of it bursting or if indeed it has done so . 
  in other words , removing the appendix happens * in a medical emergency * . 
  which , i confidently assert , is a far cry from religious or aesthetic reasons . 
  if a child is suffering from phimosis or , i do n't know , infection or inflammation of the foreskin , then a circumcision might well be the appropriate medical reaction but that is still not comparable to religious or aesthetic reasons . 
  nor do i believe `` just in case , there might be some positive side-effects '' to be a particularily strong reason either . 
  exactly !, 
  that 's the same kind of shit we get here . 
  irrelevant . 
  the ads are trying to make it sound german and that 's what i was talking about . 
  then opel needs to quit putting up a german fa\u00e7ade with their pseudo-german has-been celebrities , their german slogans and their bullshit . 
  / u/hitler for mod ? 
  really ? 
  and it should be discussed but i do n't think that the people who are trying to discuss it are making a good name of themselves by constantly going `` what about mgm ? '', 
  and never acknowleding the victories in the area of fgm . 
  i feel like the fgm legislation should be built on to cover mgm as well but i do n't think that is done by snide and spiteful remarks on the internet . 
  portugal , cyprus , estonia and latvia minor exceptions ? 
  well , exactly . 
  so i do n't see why it always has to be `` ignore that , pay attention to this ! '', 
  which is what a lot of these comments seem to want . 
  i mostly agree with you , but i do n't think saying `` but what about this and this ! '', 
  is actually constructive . 
  it just makes men 's right advocates , who definitely have a point here , look a bit immature and like they begrudge the legislation already made . 
  it looks as if these posters think that fgm legislation is worthless as long as there is not also mgm legislation whereas i am of the opinion that we should treat fgm legislation as a basis to move on towards comprehensive protection against genital mutilation for * everyone * . 
  i do n't see why gender gap and `` lies '' ( often simply misinformed , hanlon 's razor ) about such are particularily relevant in this case either and bringing it up , again , looks spiteful and immature . 
  never . 
  oh i only really mind when it 's dutch politicans or political institutions saying `` holland '' and most i do then is grumble a bit . 
  and i do n't like it much when people on the internet say it but eh it 's not that big a deal . 
  doubt it . 
  you get those outside germany too . 
  agreed , but i do n't think this is `` doing something '' . 
  they 're still coming . 
  it was . 
  this one is prettier although i would n't want to have to interpret it . 
  at least it was n't a groninger . 
  yes . 
  it 's part of the west-frisian identity , that we * are * dutch and part of the netherlands . 
  we 're just * also * frisian with all that entails . 
  we 're just not hollanders , although i ca n't speak for anyone but myself and a handful of others i know the views of . 
   we chant `` hup , holland , hup ! '', 
  at the football that 's just for alliteration . 
  it 's not as if `` hup '' really actually means something . 
  i would n't mind something like `` nu !, 
  or something as a football chant . 
  good point , well made . 
  i think that 's a bit different though . 
  at least , it 's on a different stage of development . 
  portugal has derived its identity since then from that name and indirectly from that location . 
  this is also happening somewhat in the netherlands , but it 's not that far along yet and some people do n't really like it . 
   a very small amount of people , localized in the southeast of the country , apparently cares . 
  i 've only met them on reddit . 
  a very small amount of people , localized in the * northwest * of the country also cares !, 
  i 've met them in real life , on reddit and on a myriad of other sites !, 
   can you really blame em ? 
  yes . 
  yeah but if we just called all of portugal ` lisboa ' all the time , then people from other regions might end up feeling a bit left out or marginalised . 
  too good . 
  hehehe . 
  both in the english and the dutch sense ? 
  duque * . 
  ( who says quaque ), 
  it 's hideous . 
  and anyway , you accuse the french of nationalism ? 
  volvo is * safe * and that 's all there is to it . 
   i 'm wondering like who are the typical people that are doing the burning frickin ' a-holes . 
  i think you mixed things up here . 
  volvo is swedish . 
  those are * cars * ? 
  ( i kid ), 
   why not discuss it as general genital mutilation ? 
  exactly . 
  why not discuss both ? 
  but a comment like / u / _ samss _ up there made seems to bemoan that there is * any discussion at all * and does not add anything to * any * discussion . 
   this is utter bollocks . 
  it does not happen in reality and it 's not even close . 
  except in this thread where he tries to hijack it and turn it into a petty whinge instead of actually trying to do something with it . 
  i dont think that 's what 's happening here . 
  just conceited internet bullshit , but i do n't see how this is `` fighting against female rights '' . 
  it 's just some berk who wants to have everything happen at once and so shits on things when only part of it happens .
