  did i miss something ? 
  i 'm also quite partial to lamb . 
  hmmmm . 
  consider me scared !, 
  well , not that i was going to go to p'tugal any time soon , but still !, 
  that 's a painfully dull cover . 
  what 's up with the white void ? 
  i mean , it 's not the only place that has white flight , but * industrialised white flight ? 
  * that 's inventive . 
  heh those quotes are funny . 
  still * an * issue though . 
  i know it . 
  haha yes !, 
  you 're the second person to link it here and i was familiar with it already . 
  it does n't work very smoothly but it does work eventually . 
  yeah i know , it 's pretty neat !, 
  there are some things that do n't work quite well at all due to some differences in the language and probably in the way he says it as well . 
  funny thing is `` buy '' seems to be a more or less unique form of the verb . 
  german , dutch and frisian use `` kaufen '' , `` kopen '' and `` keapje '' respectively so it 's not weird there was a bit of confusion about that . 
  very cool that the farmer immediately understood `` broon coo '' though . 
  and it 's technically not `` northern holland '' but oh well . 
  why ? 
  i was more thinking capo di tutti capi , the [ godfather ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capo_di_tutti_capi ) , but okay . 
  victory is mine !, 
  ah yes , perfidious albion . 
  i do n't think that was the main reason behind the trade wars though . 
  that seems to have been more spiteful mercantilism . 
  do n't see how . 
  britain and the netherlands ( and france ) just had a bunch of different names and methods of governance but they were mostly a continuous entity for the past few hundred years . 
  germany was n't , it was just a loose collection of states with no national identity to bind them . 
  that only happened slightly over a century ago . 
  nope . 
  pretty sad for those guys . 
  yeah but usually you guys pretend this was what you wanted all along and it was purely a `` revolution '' and in no way shape or form an invasion no sirree bob and hey did you know britain has n't been invaded for nearly a milennium and when that happened the normans cheated anyway so it really should n't count ? 
  saying the equivalent of `` merry christmas '' is pushing an agenda nowadays ? 
  have you hit your head recently ? 
   certainly do n't see similar posts for other religious holidays yes you do . 
   i 'm all for being accepting of different cultures no you 're not . 
   but this just comes across as blatant politically correct pandering . 
  no it does n't . 
  and again , thank you for that , canada . 
  two out of four . 
  which logically means we won two out of four as well . 
  let 's call it a tie . 
  ( and get our revenge when those islander bastards are n't looking ! ), 
  huh what ? 
  i do n't think that was anyone 's goal at the time as nobody really had the goal of unifying europe in the first place . 
  they were wars over mercanitilism versus `` free '' trade , over who got to use which trade routes and over establishing dominance in international trade . 
  there were 4 wars , `` we '' won two of them . 
  not bad in my book . 
  and the raid on the medway/battle of chatham is hilarious regardless . 
  sailing up the * thames * , sinking the english fleet , stealing their flagship and buggering off again ? 
  priceless . 
  and it 's also fun to look at the participants . 
  first war ; dutch republic versus the commonwealth of england . 
  seems fair . 
  ** england won though ** . 
  also started it , bitches . 
  second war ; dutch republic , denmark and france against england and the bishop of m\u00fcnster . 
  slightly less balanced . 
  anyone with any experience playing europa universalis knows that m\u00fcnster generally does not compare to france . 
  ** dutch victory ** . 
  third war ; dutch republic and kingdom of denmark-norway against england , * france * , bishopric of m\u00fcnster * again * and cologne . 
  even though this one included the `` disaster year '' and internal turmoil as well as foreign invasions next to the sea war , it was still a ** dutch victory ** . 
  fourth war : france changed sides again !, 
  dutch republic and france versus great britain ( and wikipedia seems to imply this was a seperate great britain from the british empire ) . 
  ** british win ** . 
  interesting accent . 
  also , he did n't explain the image that was shown when he mentioned the disaster year . 
  so i will do so here . 
  the image shows the grand pensionary ( head honcho ) and his brother johan and cornelis de witt having been lynched after being blamed for the disaster year and accused of treason . 
  the two brothers were murdered , torn apart & mutilated and some people allegedly at some of their bits . 
  coins are cooler anyway and durable as well . 
  hot damn that is some tragic shit . 
  haha britain ? 
  nope . 
  it 's the usa that 's heading down that route . 
  op is not talking about english as a lingua franca , your example of / r/europe makes no sense . 
   if people will stay speaking their own language next to english , it 's actually a good thing . 
  would be nice if more dutch people kept that in mind . 
  also in regards to the other native language of the netherlands . 
  i can see it happening after a longer period of time . 
  styles and fashions spread more easily an everbody ends up wearing , doing and building similar stuff . 
   so why is it that every single person in this thread is speaking language ? 
  top comment claiming to be the unpopular opinion ? 
  i agree with you . 
  lingua franca in an international context is fine , but i see no need to use it in a casual dutch context . 
  kinda , but that 's more due to its prevalence and pervasiveness rather than due to any special quality of the language . 
  brb getting deported . 
   this is so german ... you linksextremisten that 's a pointless attack . 
   is the moderate , centrist , enlightened view . 
  these are meaningless self-serving buzzwords . 
  do n't be a twat , m ` lord . 
  why not current frisian ? 
  :p it 's even in the same subset of germanic languages as english is . 
  iceland can go flog itself . 
  old frisian was probably the closest . 
  * however * , my remark was not a serious one and was intended to tease the anglosphere . 
  the original . 
  nah , erdogan is the boss of all bosses .
