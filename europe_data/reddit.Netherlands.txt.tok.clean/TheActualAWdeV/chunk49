   even if he really wants to buy food . 
  then where does mcdonalds come in ? 
  from the perspective of how much chaos these gits might cause in faroffistan , yes . 
  from the perspective of the danish treasury though , not really . 
  fair enough . 
  smugglers intimidating , extorting or simply robbing innocent people out of their boats because their previous smuggling boat got shot incoming ... 
  fair enough , it 's an interesting thought experiment . 
  maybe you could ask in / r/whatif or / r/askhistorians . 
  crikey , these people sure do dwell in the past . 
  descendents of the anci\u00e9n regime , descendants of the emperors , descendents of the restauration . 
  are blood and genes really that relevant for actually ruling shit ? 
  that 's the joke . 
  good , dude fucks shit up badly . 
  ah , i thought that 's what it was but it makes no sense . 
   i was surprised how fantastic ireland 's weather it was shit awful in december . 
  like the netherlands except , somehow , even wetter & windier . 
  looks like a toad with a unibrow drawn in marker and a wig on . 
  been there , seen that !, 
  did n't know they were that old though . 
  and those trains every two minutes was just sexy . 
  * why ? 
  i ca n't hear the answer , what is it ? 
  it got harpooned . 
  :( it is still unknown whether it was the japanese or the icelanders . 
  huh , weird . 
  ... okay that does it , i 'm outta here . 
  wake me up in 60 million years when this silliness is over . 
  damn . 
  lots of borderfuckery is necessary for a greater frysl\u00e2n . 
  oh well , frisian eastern border reaches germany , groningen becomes frisian . 
  something like that could make for interesting alternate-historical speculation but then you 'd need to find an explanation as to * why * it was never colonised and for that you 'd probably need to invent some non-historically plausible reasons like the natives being capable of fighting off european conquerors . 
  regardless , it 's very hard to imagine how it would be if it was left alone . 
  ... how ? 
  there is no feasible way to occupy something as ridicu-huge unless you have some sort of space alien invasion force . 
  sorry , had to . 
  nah you can tell by the drunk racket they make . 
  well , it clearly was n't a british tourist either . 
   belarus is doing quite well is n't it ? 
  is it ? 
  do n't know about kazakhstan either but now i do wonder . 
  yes , north korea and belarus are doing * so well * . 
  ... yeah true , fair enough . 
  was this not self-evident ? 
  france has * monarchists * ? 
  [ but in this one they say `` kampai '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6rxzk3ltna ) , and that 's japanese for `` cheers '' . 
  he says his name is `` rammelbips '' and `` rammel '' also means `` rattle/shake '' . 
  tmyk !, 
  the voice does sound a bit hammy though . 
  it was built during the 80 year 's war ( against spain ) and was later also used to fight off the prince-bishopric of m\u00fcnster . 
  so the germans as well . 
  bourtange is way up in the north-west of the netherlands and belgium is to the south and also became independent long after the fortress was built . 
  i was wondering what `` jewish trombones '' were at first but then i actually read the title . 
  probably refers to `` cuckold '' . 
  a cuckold is someone , usually a dude , who gets off on seeing their spouse fucked by someone else . 
  not entirely sure how it applies here but it 's probably some racist shit about big black bogeymen raping swedish women and swedish men being too pussy to stop them . 
   although , ca n't we just have joint monarchs ? 
  you mean ... a united kingdom ? 
  what a silly idea . 
   there is no absolute answer to who gets more out of the relationship then why did you claim it was the eu getting more out of it than the uk ? 
   and how do you propose bringing these people to trial ? 
  drones shooting nets instead of rockets . 
  \\* pew * , caught one !, 
  and then you pick them up with a new doodad on your drone and chug along back to base some 90kg heavier . 
  depends on what you want them for and how you use them . 
  some kinds of jails help reduce the chances of recidivism by changing the way people think , teaching them non-criminal skills and so on . 
  and another kind of prison sentence reduces the chance of recidivism by simply never letting them out again . 
   inevitable coalitions nothing wrong with those . 
  compromise and agreement are fine things . 
  in the case of the names it 's * below * them . 
  it says `` lieblingsname '' in black , below it the names , below * that * location and year of the source , then the source , * then * `` favourite surnames '' , again in black letters . 
  haha nice . 
  really ? 
  what the fuck they do that for ? 
  i wanted to say high * er * , oops . 
  haha great . 
   in fact there 's a bit of rivalry between the two , or at least from groningen towards friesland . 
  there is/was a similar sentiment from friesland towards groningen . 
  a story behind the [ oldehove ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/oldehove_ ( gebouw ) ) . 
  tl ; dr , groningen had the martini-tower and leeuwarden wanted to build a tower that was even high ** er ** and made a spirited effort to do so . 
  however , the ground was soft and swampy underneath and the tower started leaning over long before it was finished . 
  work was abandoned for fear of the tower leaning over and eventually falling down if it was made any higher . 
  nice view though . 
  my cunningly disguised link does n't work due to fuckery with parentheses so here 's a seperate url ; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oldehove_ ( tower ) . 
  this one in english . 
  edit ; tixed a fypo . 
  yes . 
  part of the lands inbetween are however temporarily occupied by decadent traitors who call themselves `` the province of groningen '' . 
   i actually watched the second one in a cinema ah . 
  the foreigners/zombies in the second movie are the frisians , of which i am one . 
  the lead zombie is a ( was , apparently ) a locally famous actor as well . 
  i thought it was funny to see him in that movie . 
  as you can see , it is all high-quality well-made health food . 
  new kids turbooooo . 
  i thought he was singling out agressive refugees instead of refugees as such . 
  and really , fuck you if you 're being aggressive . 
  to be fair , aggressive natives should be treated exactly the same though . 
   a constructed language \\* cough * like standard dutch . 
  \\* cough *, 
  are we talking about those ? 
  i thought you meant just the headscarf .
