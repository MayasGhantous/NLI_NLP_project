  the second part being '' - ia '' . 
  that would make sense . 
  weed out the prussians , the bavarians , the alsatians and whatever and all you have left is a clump of north sea-y merchants . 
  i 'm dutch , but not a hollander . 
  that is , i 'm frisian but frisians are just as dutch as any other dutchman and i can get pretty annoyed when any specific dutch `` subculture '' , as it were , is treated as `` the one true dutch '' . 
  some time ago there was a bit of a ruckus about the new queen , maxima ( before she was queen ) saying that there is n't a single `` dutch '' identity . 
  people for some reason got angry that she said that . 
  there is n't one . 
  the country is n't a cultural monobloc . 
  a frisian is not the same as a zeeuw , is not the same as limburger , is not the same as an utrechter , is not the same as an achterhoeker who is n't the same as any other gelderlander and they 're not the same as amsterdammers who are n't the same as rotterdammers . 
  hell , w\u00e2ldfriezen ( wood frisians ) are n't the same as klaaifriezen ( clay frisians ) who are n't the same as any flavour of city frisian and the [ bilkerts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/het_bildt ) are different still . 
  the way they/we speak is similar to that of the [ stadsfriezen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stadsfries ) but without being actually in any city-like environment . 
  it 's farmland all around . 
  so , to be accurate , i 'm a bilkert , a frisian , a dutchman and a european . 
  but my being dutch is probably the most significant . 
  that said , on the whole this is n't that important to me although i 've rambled a bit now . 
  nor does it mean i have a special fondness of other dutch people , especially not if they 're being derogatory or childish about other parts of the country . 
  they 're basically rivella ? 
  also , i was in copenhagen for a few days this week , along with my brother . 
  pretty city . 
  did n't eat any rullepolse but did have a lot of other polses . 
  very nice . 
   the woman was in the third trimester and piratically ready to give birth so with an eyepatch and the doctor had a hook-hand ? 
  that 's ... wow . 
  that 's wow . 
  haha i can imagine . 
  they 're usually not red after all . 
  hm , you 're right . 
  did n't see that at the time . 
  haha they do look like hearts do n't they ? 
  the shape and the colour and all . 
  they 're actually [ lily-leaves ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuphar_lutea ) although i still do n't know they 're red . 
  it makes for a more striking flag , i suppose . 
   the average price of a sixpack of beer in norway is $ 45 . 
  ticking sundial bomb . 
  exactly . 
  if it 's singular , would it be a listerium bacterium ? 
  historically speaking , russia is behaving pretty normal . 
  it 's the eu that 's behaving abnormally . 
  well it was , back in the day against the franks . 
  and then you guys sent off your fleet to harass the north-western frankish coast ( inhabited by the frisians ) which caused the franks to reconsider their expansionist policies towards denmark . 
  the planetarium is more badical though . 
   ultra-common , bog-standard vauxhall with fancy name because `` opel '' is too bloody continental . 
  [ it just needs a bit of paint ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freight_bicycle#mediaviewer/file:workcycles-bakfiets-medium.jpg ) . 
  oh nice , i was wondering where the greek came from . 
  and i realise morocco/algeria/tunesia are n't europe but seeing as they 're named and coloured on the map , i 'm now also curious what the etymology derives from . 
  it 's still a bit weird to colour it blue though as the map implies garda is derived from the latin politia . 
  i thought the point was more names and markings instead of the specific type of car . 
  that 's what i was paying attention to anyway . 
  keeping in mind full well that some pictures looked flashier than the average car would and some looked lumpier than the average police car from that country would . 
  well , i mean , not that it matters if you do . 
  i 'm sure truckers love you . 
  haha no , i know . 
  it 's not * factually * one , but it can be considered * basically * like one . 
  must 've been * very * short if a dane could throw it . 
  the bit of the country i 'm in was mostly outside of roman reach as there was n't much to get and it was n't worth getting from the population . 
  lots of swamps , bogs and other waters and periodically a lot more water covered the area . 
  the frisians did a bit of trading and kept a lot of cattle and that was about it . 
  the core frisian lands ( now way outside frisian reach ) was occupied at the start of the specified time by the romans and they exacted taxes from the rest of the area . 
  drusus wanted to expand into germanic lands and laid down some roads , bridges and canals to better transport an army and materiel with although the expansion never really happened , as far as i can tell . 
  in 28 some new bloke in the area , named olennius , decided he wanted bigger cow-skins as taxes and commited atrocities to get to it . 
  the frisians then hanged the tax collectors and olennius fled to the roman castellum at flevum ( whereabouts unkown ) . 
  the frisians besieged it but retreated when they heard of roman reinforcements and eventually fought [ the battle of baduhenna wood ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_baduhenna_wood ) . 
  the romans did n't take immediate revenge , only re-establishing their dominion under corbulo but he had orders to stay behind the rhine which left the frisians/germanics in the area a territory much larger than is now considered `` frisian '' . 
  in 69 the frisians apparently joined the [ revolt of iulius civilis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolt_of_the_batavi ) although did n't do a lot . 
  after that a whole lot of nothing much happened although the frisians apparently supplied a bunch of auxiliary troops to rome . 
  by the end of the 3rd century the romans started leaving the area which coincided with a severe depopulation of the area here , so much so that there are no archeological remnants from between the third and fifth centuries . 
  only in the migration period did new people appear here and they would eventually also end up being called `` frisians '' . 
  the original population partially emigrated to the coasts of kent and flanders as the local frisian type of pottery has been found there but most probably moved away from the coasts and into other more roman-y areas . 
  most of this is from the book `` de friezen '' by luit van der tuuk as well as supporting bits off of wikipedia . 
  that 's pretty far . 
  ahh yes . 
  the good old days . . ? 
  technowolves are the coolest . 
  haha seems to me it 's still an ugly building if it 's only palatable at night or from above . 
  * that * 's what you guys were exporting to russia ? 
  ... we already have that . 
  like , lots . 
  lots and lots and lots . 
  god that second picture of holyrood looks ` orrible . 
  like a shantytown . 
  imagine it like the peloponnesos . 
  the city-state is sparta , brutally ruling over the area , but that does n't mean it 's * just * the city of sparta as it lorded over quite an area outside the city itself . 
   a city-state is an independent or autonomous entity , not administered as a part of another local government , whose territory consists of a city and ** possibly its surrounding territory ** with `` the rest of iceland '' being , facetiously , the territory surrounding the main city . 
  if you see the little tower on the left , that 's actually the prime minister 's office . 
  it 's literally named '' [ the little tower ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torentje ) '' . 
  most over-the-top in-your-face intimidating ; romania . 
  my eyes are n't fresh enough anymore . 
  fair enough , i did n't think of that . 
  when the post was 30 minutes old i saw it and consequently forgot all about it . 
  i 'll dishonour your mom !, 
  also , i do n't think those guys had a lot of golden aging going around . 
  they were pretty big traders though but eventually got eliminated by the franks . 
  i find it a bit odd they say `` the netherlands an agricultural nation '' when the high level of agricultural export is due to trade rather than agriculture . 
  the last picture actually looks quite dreary and depressing with the half-lit tower and the massive cloud of smoke/fog/smog / foke . 
  the [ golden age ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gouden_eeuw ) was , duh . 
  where on earth was anyone saying anything similar ? 
  fuck off with your imaginary slippery slope bullshit before you further damage the collective iq of / r/europe , it 's in a bad enough state already . 
  this was seriously the dumbest goddamn shit i 'd read all day . 
  the point of race and sex being called social constructs is to demonstrate that they 're not sensible bases to discriminate on , no-one was implying africans were white or that all girls would have dicks .
