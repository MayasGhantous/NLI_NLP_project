   is it really a matter of which countries are in the eu ? 
  seeing as half the time the brits are bitching about merkel , brussels or france , i do n't think just those countries would actually solve the problem . 
  err , how ? 
  only if it 's this funny . 
  do n't be such a / u/fcknleaver . 
  costa paprica ofcourse . 
  more like polocaust amirite, 
  thank you captain buzzword . 
  i am referring to the idea of `` suspend asylum '' . 
  which is not going to happen . 
  pay more attention to economic migrants and people smugglers , sure , but that 's not the same as suspending asylum . 
  as you said , they 're not the same thing so why should actual asylum be suspended ? 
  klingonberry jam, 
  staples . 
  full of iron . 
  also , wheat , rye , oats i think . 
  wheat wins by a large margin . 
  and rice ofcourse . 
   how about `` shank in the side '' or `` kick in the groin '' ? 
  but then they could n't make an oh so clever reference to the nazi 's !, 
   suspend asylum completely until the crisis is over . 
  does n't that kind of completely defeat the point of an asylum policy in the first place ? 
  and i do n't think closing eu borders is gon na be that easy either . 
  having a british passport makes them a british citizen . 
  that 's what / u/zoemayacastillo said too . 
  and if they are a british citizen then they are usually referred to as british , even if their nationality or ethnicity is not the same . 
  i do n't know if we actually have a close rival . 
  worst enemy * and * closest rival was probably historically england . 
  nowadays i do n't know . 
  do n't really have a worst enemy no mo ' and i do n't know a close rival . 
  maybe belgium but they do other things . 
  maybe germany but they 're also our closest partner and super important for our trade and economy . 
   should be denied the use of vowels . 
  they would hardly be affected anyway if they only use one vowel . 
  [ dutch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_netherlands_air_force#/media/file:netherlands_roundel.svg ) . 
  [ czech ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:czech_roundel.svg ) . 
  should be fine . 
  if not , the dutch were first . 
  based on ze size of his genitals we can konclude zat zis man is both twenty-zree and a little bitch who feels ze need zu kompenzate . 
   should be happy some cities have canals , as far as i know , all dutch cities have them . 
  not really a solution and not really applicable to europe either . 
  australia is an island . 
  europe is not . 
  there really should n't be any more explanation necessary for why it 's not quite that simple . 
  yeah it 's all the women 's fault !, 
  how dare they have their own lives as well !, 
   they are quite hilarious and it 's amazing that they do n't understand that the pope speaks in metaphors . 
  seemingly gendered and personal ones . 
  i 'm sorry , but if you go around heavily insinutating `` the jews are subverting our communications '' then i 'm going to ask for some clarification , okay ? 
  i ca n't read into your possibly imaginary spousal status either so how the hell does that make sense ? 
  wait , sorry , was this a satirical post or are you genuinely saying `` do n't listen to those who disagree with you , they 're all jews anyway '' ? 
  edit ; fixed a type . 
  wrote `` posts '' , plural . 
  really ? 
  awesome . 
  are you emigrating or doing a study-abroad type thing ? 
  because if the latter ; leave the computer tower at home . 
  it seems like a ridiculous hassle and waste of money to haul all that over and then have to do it all again when you 're going back . 
   i 've been a night owl the last few weeks , a night owl ? 
  are you a good owl ? 
  are you striving to become a better owl ? 
  is your end goal to become a superb owl ? 
   endemic neither is anglo-saxon culture to be fair . 
  :p i mean , i just think it 's a weird word to use in this context . 
  do tourists count as citizens ? 
  several of them * are * minors . 
  i do n't see how anyone is `` passing '' here . 
  i mean , i do n't necessarily disagree with the first part of what you said , the other part just seems weird . 
  oh that was n't what i was saying . 
  i was n't questioning the figures , i was making the point that nobody brings up `` this is just a single data point ! '', 
  when it 's a fearmongering story . 
  i feel like having a certain phonetic element makes languagemore simple to understand . 
  removing the `` i '' from oignon seems counterproductive in that regard . 
  rather remove the g although that would probably work differently for someone more familiar with french funetiks . 
   where she 'll hurt innocents ? 
  doubt she 'll get the chance . 
  she 's already declared to want out of isis . 
  joining a group that glorifies murder * is * fucking crazy . 
  and it 's also a mistake if you apparently do n't like their ideas . 
  it 's a honking big stupid mistake , but still a mistake . 
  i think there 's another possibility . 
  that she * did * hear about isis and the evil shit they pull but that she believed that those bad things were propaganda . 
  or do you consider that ` near-retard ' ? 
  would n't that be seperate ? 
  if she was involved in acts of terror and violence then those would be treasonous but is simply leaving and joining a different group treason too ? 
  we fucking love peanut butter , bro . 
  it might be an interesting idea but i can definitely see the issues with what you 're proposing . 
  i mean , an eu-wide vote of no confidence for an elected * national * leader ? 
  that 's a whole new can of worms . 
  i do n't think any nation would feel more sovereign or democratic if that waas possible . 
   netherlands as far as i know , this is correct . 
  but it * is * more complicated than that . 
  firstly , antillean and surinamese individuals are not part of the recent migration/refugee waves . 
  not saying you said that , but i think it 's important to note . 
  secondly , some other ` immigrant ' groups show * lower * crime rates than native dutch . 
  i think there was a post about on / r/thenetherlands semi-recently , i 'll need to look into it , but ` indos ' are * underrepresented * . 
  thirdly , i do n't have issue believing young antillean and surinamese rotterdams are overrepresented but i also have the feeling ( i need the stats to back it up ) that they are on average more likely to be in lower income areas and those generally have higher crime rates regardless of ethnicity or religion . 
  there were some other points i think i was planning to make but i forgot . 
  you can , yes . 
  but most of the time posts about immigrant crime rates are the same kind of single data point just like this one .
