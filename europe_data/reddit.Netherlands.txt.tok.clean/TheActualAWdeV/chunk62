  so thanks for the sources although i was mostly wondering about the `` sweden number 2 in world rape '' . 
  chat a wunt . 
  well if you have a statistical fact then i 'm sure you have a reliable source as well . 
  yeah , that 's not stupid . 
  just cynical . 
  i 'm sure there 's some actual nazi fucks out there who like this . 
  jews are leaving and they 'd just need to be tougher on the other immigrants for two birds with one stone . 
  although that 's probably not what 's happening here . 
  but monaco is known for three things . 
  formula one , gambling and tax evasion . 
   ( i 'm just making the wild assumption that nobody worships the greek gods anymore . ), 
  only neo-pagans do and they 're generally silly as shit . 
  i do n't think * he * understands the distinction . 
  he only says he 's anti-islam when someone calls him out on his anti-muslim rhetoric but he continues going `` do we want more or fewer moroccans ! '', 
  and no frisian at all . 
  heavy accent but pretty fluent . 
  woke up with headache . 
  still have headache . 
  he * would * die at 69 , i guess . 
  do n't cover up shit but if you do at least do it fucking right . 
  this just looks double bad . 
  no , i 'm not going to let you get away with this kind of snide dismissal . 
  i asked some questions . 
  i 'm not expecting you to answer them because you ca n't but i am expecting the common courtesy of you acknowledging them instead of brushing my comment aside and setting up a straw man that makes me look like a cowardly lunatic . 
  you are oversimplifying the situation . 
  the police is steeped in the situaton , but only in part of it . 
  there is more to it than that . 
  criminals need to be punished , yes . 
  but measures must also be taken to reduce the incidence of crime in the first place . 
  giving more money to the police does not do that . 
  giving more money to the police does not solve the problem . 
  the problem is poor management of the refugee crisis and of immigrant communities . 
  so how about you stop pretending you have everything sorted out already and that it 's all the fault of rich suburbanites and immigrants alike and actually put some content in your posts ? 
  i did n't stop thinking about it . 
  i never said i stopped thinking about , do n't give me that bullshit that i 'm ignoring the problem or that i 'm ` afraid to admit ' anything . 
  you are the one afraid to admit anything . 
  you are afraid to admit that maybe it 's not quite as black and white as you 're trying to paint . 
  you are afraid to admit that it actually is a goddamn complicated problem and that it wo n't be solved by buzzwords and mindless blame games . 
  nobody was saying anything of a sort . 
  at least keep your strawmen relevant dude . 
  does that really change anything ? 
  instead of being scared in general you now have a specific group to be afraid of . 
  are you actually less safe now ? 
  does this mean people not belonging to that group ca n't be scary anymore ? 
  feeling safer is not the same as being safer . 
  you can be statistically much safer yet feel a lot less safe . 
  what is up with this emotional reasoning ? 
  are you trying to convince him he should * feel * less safe ? 
  it 's not anything new . 
  people have been saying the same thing for a long time . 
  even if the risk is now higher you 'll still be usually safe and this guy is jumping on the panic . 
  drama queen . 
  well done you for reading my mind , mate . 
  that is ofcourse * exactly * what i was thinking . 
  i do n't think that 's a fair assessment of the people you disagree with . 
  nor do i think it 's quite as simple as saying `` police officers know what immigrant communities are like '' . 
  maybe they do . 
  but are all immigrant communities the same ? 
  if so , why , if not why not ? 
  what are the actual reasons why ` immigrant communities ' are what they are ? 
  more police spending sounds good for the police but would that actually solve the problem ? 
  might make it easier to deal with symptoms rather than the cause . 
  i personally do n't think it 's as easy as saying `` islam '' or `` not being european '' is the cause and that it 's a bit more complicated than that . 
  i do think things are being handled badly in many regards and i do n't like the convenient characterisation of people 's concerns as being racist either but it is a more complicated situation than is often seen in political discourse . 
  disproportionate police spending !, 
  probably there 's more to it than that . 
  seems to me they have to deal with the bad shit involving immigrants more often . 
  not ` immigrants ' as a whole but * criminal * immigrants . 
  which , while seemingly more numerous than they ought to be , still are only a subset of ` immigrants ' . 
  / u/splergel gives the example of the red cross maybe being more sympathetic because they see the sad shit some immigrants go to more often whereas the police see the sad shit some immigrants * do * and that these groups then develop their own views based on a limited point of view . 
  they just have to look muslim i guess ? 
   come at the cost of civilian rights ? 
  assuming the police were justified in drawing and firing weapons could definitely be interpreted as coming at the cost of civilian rights . 
  it might not , but it seems obvious why one would think it might . 
  i kind of agree with you but you 're taking it too far . 
  it 's a bit more complicated than `` they 're all paranoid nazis '' and to claim that is counterproductive to discussion . 
  i 've also heard some muslims say that * some * alcohol is okay , just so long you do n't get ( routinely ) wasted . 
  so there is some leeway , or at least they give themselves some leeway . 
  they are still muslims , even if some hardliner elsewhere might want to stone them for it . 
   he situation in afghanistan has been more or less stabilized by now . 
  you have the choice of several warlords and fundamentalist gangs !, 
  who would n't want to stay there !, 
  just stack them on top of eachother . 
  implying there 's a difference . 
  it 's not slavery by the simple point that conscripts get paid . 
  they are not property , they are employees albeit with very little options . 
  you you you ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutionary_cells_%28german_group%29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rote_zora i ran into the first one looking at the raf and such and was pretty surprised . 
  i do n't know . 
  that sounds like rose-tinted glasses ; check these ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction#list_of_assaults_attributed_to_the_raf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_june_movement#bombings.2c_kidnappings.2c_and_other_violent_acts or all of this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles or these ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eta_%28separatist_group%29#victims.2c_tactics_and_attacks, 
  food resources maybe ? 
  uranium in the middle of fuck-off nowhere is nice but it 's not going to kickstart your civilization . 
  was n't really a quote . 
  was severely overdramatised . 
  oh come do n't exaggerate . 
  i made a mistaken in omitting ` radical anarcho - ( feminist ) . 
  they were a lot worse and their goals can not be compared with tumblr 's excessives . 
  my point was that it was already there . 
  hence my examples of homebrewn anarcho-feminist commie-nazi 's . 
  europe has traditionally * been * a violent region and it was only very recently and for a very short time that it was calm and peaceful .
