  doubt that . 
  they could n't even be bothered to take to the voting booths . 
  only this once . 
  making it a single country for the olympics means fewer athletes means fewer medals . 
  obviously then , we should only count it like this when the games are finished . 
  that is true , but if we do that then our states would have states . 
  or provinces . 
  or oblasts . 
  or regions . 
  it would get confusing . 
  hodor ? 
  well den , mark . 
  haw , technically true i suppose , but nobody counts it that way . 
  which typical redditor ? 
  i have not seen a single post like that in this thread . 
  in this case it was apparently a temporary way of commemorating the people who died in the bataclan attack and it 's cleaned up now . 
  ... that 's kinda dumb . 
  ah yes , he 's clearly a nazi . 
  lol , does erdogan know ? 
  correct . 
  man , you could 've had ** ni ** estudia ** n ** i traba ** ja **, 
  jesus christ that 's ridiculous . 
  poor guy and poor family . 
  worst . 
  holiday . 
  ever . 
  aside from that being a stupid strawman , how is it even relevant ? 
  you are bargaining * crisps * . 
  better than me personally . 
  yes , let 's make him a martyr . 
  mostly not on this subreddit in fact . 
  brilliance . 
  edit ; wait fuck the tunnel . 
  or they 'd just go through ireland or scotland if it scexits from the brexit . 
  fairy nuff, 
  true , but it causes criticism and protests and may not be politically plausible because of that . 
  i think you 'd get screwed in your ace-hole by the french . 
  although they did kill off their aristocracy at one point , so i do n't know ... 
  plenty of time to get some popcorn then . 
  a single location is by definition not going to be `` easily policed '' though . 
  and islands in greece are not `` outside of europe '' and probably pretty easy to find land from . 
  total bitch of an investment probably . 
   exactly , it 's an easy solution nnyeeeeeegh ... 
  probably a lot more complicated than it sounds . 
  long-term effects should be taken into consideration . 
  besides . 
  okay , let 's say libya . 
  build a city , somehow , with an undefined amount of money . 
  who pays ? 
  who guards it ? 
  national armies ? 
  who does what ? 
  if things go to shit in that city , how responsible are these militaries and by extension their countries ? 
  it might be a * relatively * easy solution . 
  the only real solution is getting all the shit in the middle east and africa sorted proper but that 's a total bitch to do . 
  do n't think it really applies here . 
  there 's not really a suitable place to dump people on , not a unified navy to keep people on that island instead of going literally every which way and finding any of a myriad suitable landing spots * and * it does n't actually solve the problem of actually discerning and locating the refugees and getting things actually organised into moving them somewhere . 
  you 'd also need quite a large surface area islandwise . 
  so it just sounds like empty rhetoric to me . 
  stupid shit that sounds catchy but has no practical use . 
  also , i 'm not sure it actually * has * worked well in australia . 
  oh please , he was never going to succeed in pushing it over . 
  there are too many people holding it up . 
  are we deflating ? 
  help help i do n't want to sink, 
  i 've done two of those . 
  kazan might 've been a more interesting destination than yekaterinburg although that still had quite a few nice places . 
  except , amazingly , without being attractive in any way ... 
   again lol, 
  do it now . 
  wait . 
  the fleur-de-lis is a lily , is it not ? 
  they hate us ? 
  a wolf . 
  wow , real creative . 
  but it 's also young and middle-aged british tourists in the baltics , having alcohol issues and drinking way too much . 
  or middle-aged british tourists touring cities in western europe , still drinking too much . 
  i do n't know about you , but i already have a cannon . 
  `` oh yes , just swim to 50 meters depth then wait there for 10 minutes for a magical portal that takes you straight to the uk home office '' . 
  sausage can be other than pork too , surely ? 
  give them a curly-wurly tail or a pig nose instead of the clown 's nose . 
   you want it triggered now , when westminster does n't have any clue as to how it wants approach the negotiations yet ? 
  yes . 
  so basically one rolls royce . 
  my argument is more that taking away a single factor does not matter . 
  at all . 
  people do n't bully based on clothes . 
  the clothes are just an excuse . 
  bullies will bully if they have a suitable feeling and if they believe they can get away with it . 
  if they ca n't bully on clothing , so what ? 
  they 'll bully on something else . 
   and more generally i like the fact that kids from poorer background dont have to suffer the consequences of something they cant influence by not having to wear shitty clothes in school because there is a uniform . 
  i ca n't say i 've ever noticed that problem . 
  although maybe that 's due to the fairly high wealth equality in my country/my area . 
  except by the time you end up in university you will already be stuck in the mold as most of your mental development will be done . 
  and becoming a productive part of society involves being able to deal with social situations and personal choices as well . 
  i do n't think uniforms are in any way helpful in that regard , and even counterproductive . 
  the reason is irrelevant though . 
  you 're not stopping the problem . 
   to stop kids from competing with each other on who has the latest fashion .
