  i just took a list from an eu website and looked at how close turkey seemed to join . 
  are you saying that 's a reason why they ca n't or should n't join or that 's the reason why they 're supposed to be the next member ? 
   membership criteria -- who can join ? 
   the treaty on the european union states that any european country may apply for membership if it respects the democratic values of the eu and is committed to promoting them . 
   the first step is for the country to meet the key criteria for accession . 
  these were mainly defined at the european council in copenhagen in 1993 and are hence referred to as ` copenhagen criteria ' . 
  countries wishing to join need to have :  ** stable institutions guaranteeing democracy , the rule of law , human rights and respect for and protection of minorities ; ** not by a long shot . 
   ** a functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competition and market forces in the eu ; ** dubious . 
   ** the ability to take on and implement effectively the obligations of membership , including adherence to the aims of political , economic and monetary union . 
  ** very dubious . 
   ** the eu also needs to be able to integrate new members ** . 
  ca n't see that happening . 
   ** in the case of the countries of the western balkans additional conditions for membership , were set out in the so-called ` stabilisation and association process ' , mostly relating to regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations ** . 
  not sure if it applies , but it probably should . 
  especially the last part . 
   the eu operates comprehensive approval procedures that ensure new members are admitted only when they can demonstrate they will be able to play their part fully as members , namely by :  ** complying with all the eu 's standards and rules ** i severely doubt they 're anywhere close . 
   ** having the consent of the eu institutions and eu member states ** haha nope . 
   ** having the consent of their citizens -- as expressed through approval in their national parliament or by referendum . 
  ** also very unlikely . 
  so , uh , no . 
  just no . 
  edit for formatting . 
  it 's really not about to become a member . 
  no possible chance and they do n't seem interested themselves anymore . 
  that sounds iffy . 
  if there 's an excess of co2 , then that means it 's not being absorbed by plants and therefore not used for growth and therefore at least this excess has no effect on crop yield . 
  it might well be that completely no co2 emisions would have a negative effect on crops but we are clearly at a level beyond what is used by said crops and so reducing it would not harm yield and instead bring with it benefits like improving air quality and mitigating damage to the ozone layer and thereby protect against uv . 
  it seemed genuine then and it steems even more so now . 
  i do n't think that was sarcastic . 
  maybe i 'm just too tired to recognise it . 
   anti-anglo european jealousy again i see . 
  that 's convenient . 
   and to misunderstand dry british humour . 
  at this point , i think you brits do . 
  there 's always jabs and pokes at france or germany , hints at the second world war and a kind of institutionalised arrogance that is just mind-boggling to behold . 
  so many stupid comments . 
  are they all supposed to be cleverly ironic or are you guys genuinely believing it at this point ? 
  how are lower co2 emissions bad ? 
  twat and tweed have an opinion . 
  do all these celebrities weighing-in actually convince anyone or are they just preaching to their respective choirs over and over again ? 
  it 's an understandable contrast to northern ireland though , even if it 's technically incorrect and kind of misleading . 
  that man is adorable , especially with that sing-song voice . 
  burn him, 
  iran is easy to explain . 
  women are less than men . 
  homosexuals are less than even women . 
  a transgender woman is less than a woman but not as bad as a gay man , so you have the choice . 
  get hanged or get your sex changed . 
  true , good point . 
  but his popularity , the programme that 's being talked about and maybe even the whole calling everything racist thing seems to be american . 
  that 's what i meant but i said it badly , as i did n't even realise he 's a brit . 
  so , apologies . 
  i was n't talking about repairing relations though . 
  there 's a reason i put quotes around member . 
  what i meant was that it was more likely for there to be no ukraine at all rather than an eu-ukraine . 
  what with the ongoing war and all . 
  it 's more likely to be a ` member ' of russia at that point . 
  yes , the gold standard for determining racism is when an american celebrity says it is . 
  see this is why we need health and safety regulations !, 
  unbridled private enterprise just doing things for the heck of it without considering the ramifications or proper containment procedure !, 
  well the belgians * are * the red devils . 
  fukken commies, 
  i do n't think `` the eu '' as such is necessarily unwilling to secure the external borders . 
  it 's just too much hassle to try and figure out who does what , where , how and who pays for which parts for anyone to actually try anything . 
  the northern countries have at least an attitude of let the south take care of it and the southern countries do n't think it 's fair that they should shoulder the burdens when they 're already relatively worse off and have to deal with every refugee passing through already . 
  there needs to be a movement that reconciles these differences and actively pushes towards solving that issue but that brings with it a risk of impopularity both locally and eu-wide . 
  so it mostly looks like they 're trying to ignore the problem or try to alleviate the effects in their local areas . 
  honestly , at this point , it 's gon na be a bitch to solve regardless of who tries to do what option . 
  had there been a concerted effort with shared burdens to properly monitor , contain , administratively process , and parcel out the flow of people coming in then i guess a lot of the backlash could 've been avoided . 
  instead , they made a deal with turkey . 
  turkey is in a great location to handle the issues , but making a deal with and letting the turks handle it is not the same as the eu working together and actually sorting things out . 
  and now we have erdogan using them to threaten europe . 
  i guess that makes sense in context . 
  yes . 
  it 's also the eu 's fault that it 's raining outside , that cancer exists but magic does n't and that the dinosaurs are extinct . 
  nobody has any stereotypes about limerick though . 
  if you mention limerick to any dutchman and probably and frenchie , german or whatever as well , they 're just gon na think of bawdy poetry . 
  listening to the flow , the scandinavians are way different than german or dutch or english . 
  english is pretty clearly germanic . 
  not really . 
  there 's not really a limit to how long they can make it and west frisian has ten times as many speakers as scots gaelic which is included . 
  return on investment ? 
  basically a single small town here . 
  the thirty years war . 
  bo-ring . 
  the eighty years war is much more interesting . 
  and took longer , so better . 
  sweeden here apparently . 
  maybe , maybe . 
  but did all that development take place in the absolute last year ? 
  true , i just thought it was funny . 
  that seems convenient . 
  means you can pull all kinds of crap and then say `` you just do n't understaaand '' like an emo tween . 
  i agree but that 's different from what i 'm advocating . 
  those are based on an inherently unfair idea of gender and it 's basically just one man having been given the power to marry more women , regardless of their input . 
  that is wrong . 
  but that does n't mean that a relationship based on consent of every party with everyone considered equal would also be wrong , even if there were more than 2 people involved . 
  it 's not his responsibility to help members of the european parliament . 
  that 's what interpreters are for . 
  there 's a policy in place that requires an interpreter as well as translated documents for official languages of the eu .
