  that 's a shame . 
  might have made it interesting . 
  ah , so we can expect them to add the swedes . 
  that 's fine . 
  return of border controls would be a big ol' bitch though . 
  yeah as if the ridiculous weather , the shit infrastructure and the obvious corruption were n't bad enough . 
  for them it was lenient . 
  good thing too . 
  the whole thing was a farce , at least they sent her back without an actual punishment instead of , like , lashing her or something equally ludicrous . 
  edit ; the fine is still stupid . 
  i think there 's a difference between racial profiling and tippy-toeing around potential sensibilities when the perpetrators have been caught red-handed . 
  if you see a group of thugs who happen to be moroccan or whatever intimidating and robbing people , arrest them . 
  but that 's different from stopping people just because they look kind of similar to the last bunch of thugs you caught . 
  walking around is not a crime , after all . . and regardless of that , the discrepancy in criminal statistics is probably a bit more complicated than `` the cops wo n't do anything anyway '' . 
  they [ are ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yu-gi-oh!_trading_card_game ) . 
  that 's awesome and adorable . 
  there are obvious issues though . 
  first is that it 's not exactly fair . 
  if 4 out of a 100 people from a certain ethnicity do crime compared to 1 out of a 100 native dutch then you 'd think the racial profiling might help . 
  but the vast majority of them is still innocent and it 's a bit unfair ( and explicitely prohibited ) to treat them differently because of their race . 
  secondly , i 've heard many times of the phenomenon that if you get treated like scum * anyway * people might get upset and contrarian at your society and in that way racial profiling * creates * more criminals . 
  and thirdly , you might end up in a vicious cycle where you first start focusing more on one ethnicity than on others to find crime and because of that you find * more crime * in that ethnicity which means you pay more attention to that ethnicity and then find * more * ( even if it 's trivial ) again but at the same time you might be losing track of other ethnicities , including the native dutch , who might easily still be getting up to all kinds of shit . 
   that is different and i agree with you . 
  but that 's the actual subject so why did you even bring up israel ? 
  do n't worry poland . 
  your ultras are complete scum too , we already know that . 
  no need to prove it . 
  it 's not like you do n't get hooligan twats misbehaving outside of france though . 
  do n't think it 's entirely fair to blame france . 
  it 's standard as hell . 
  every country has songs about other countries sucking at football . 
  classic hit from not too long ago [ schade deutschland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumo-nkwhks ) . 
  it 's a shite song literally titled `` too bad germany , everything is over '' . 
  or a joking song from [ mexico ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmq1xw6dxp0 ) ( pretending to be ) butthurt at the dutch . 
  i 'm sure there are many many more but seeing as they 're going to be in their own languages , i do n't really know what to search for . 
  and yeah , i do reckon they taunted the losing albania fans too . 
  and sure , it 's tribalist bullshit . 
  but not necessarily specifically anti-english . 
  maybe they do more anti-english stuff because you guys are more likely to respond to it . 
  shut uuuuuup germanyyy . 
  not sure i 'd agree on ` well executed ' though . 
  it does work that way though . 
  if your political cartoons require * everything * to be labled then maybe you 're trying a bit too hard . 
  they sure gave merkel a lot of emotion too . 
  man , my friendly non-fatal eviction of a bee from my room this morning does not begin to compensate . 
  :'( fucker did wake me up after a mere three hours sleep though . 
  i agree , that 's not where you * want * to save tax money . 
  but that 's where it 's going to be saved . 
  ideally you do n't even want to save * any * tax money , you want to have the best of the best but magically at a low price too . 
  but the money has to come from somewhere and big projects are especially tricky . 
  i honestly would prefer solar panels but i 'm not sue if they could work well enough in a country like sweden . 
  or in general , really . 
  and wow , a 2 billion hole because of oversubsidies ? 
  that 's a shame . 
  but you have penny-pinching bureacrats in every government . 
  there have to be because people usually want to make cheap deals if it concerns tax money . 
  or they can build a huge trebuchet and fling it into finland . 
  or denmark , depending on where they put it . 
   why would he let the whole world know about his plans . 
  to get attention . 
  obviously , the guys who attacked him were grade-a cunts . 
  but he deliberately tried to rile them up which makes him a grand old cunt too . 
  maybe a grade-b cunt instead . 
  yes , just you . 
  you 're the only one in the wide wide world who has a distaste for groups of young men getting fucked up and fucking eachother up over an over-glorified game of kick-the-can . 
   i remember a while ago there was this group of olympique de marseilles hooligans who caused chaos in a dutch town . 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjkartnfjs0 ) . 
   hooligans are scum . 
  also yes . 
  because it 's not like [ dutch hooligans ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2wgcfg/riots_between_police_and_dutch_hooligans_in_rome/ ) are [ any better ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/4aj235/psv_fans_mocking_beggars_in_madrid/ ) . 
  and probably this happens in more countries rather than just france , the uk and the netherlands . 
   any self-respecting englander shuns that symbol , i agree . 
  at least the people using / s are n't as bad as the people advocating a sarcasm font . 
  not just boring politics , real politics !, 
  a mallard is a duck . 
  i do n't really want to spend 300 bucks and i do n't know how to install such a thing or if it 's even allowed . 
  the resources are a pretty fair point . 
  the ports , yeah that 's shit . 
  but the resources ? 
  yep . 
  oil , gems , metals ( copper , iron and aluminum for example ) , uranium , woods , fruits , cocoa , coffee , those things are all pretty useful . 
  nobody bothered saying it 's no true becaue it 's so outlandishly retarded . 
  and , for the record , it 's also not true . 
  nobody , not even dumb northern liberals , has been saying it was going to happen anytime soon though . 
  it was always more of a tactic to have turkey be amenable to european laws and standards . 
  and trying to make turkey a bit more like the eu would have made it more likely for them to eventually join but even if they were going for that it would 've taken decades to get up to standards . 
  and even then greece would fuck around with it . 
  that 's actually pretty cool . 
  and the advantage of that phrase is that it does n't really matter if you say it wrong as long as they understand it !, 
  that 's more because you lot ca n't speak anything else . 
   is this simply because of brexit ? 
  i think it 's more because of your own biases . 
  there 's more bitching about france , germany , turkey or russia . 
  it 's just * at the moment * there 's some anti-british crap flying around due to the brexit debacle . 
  and come the fuck on , jealousy ? 
  hangover from ww2 ? 
  but it 's not like the english language is in any way consistent in that regard . 
  is it it skwirrel or is it skwurl ? 
  but it 's not like the english language is in any way consistent in that regard . 
  is it it skwirrel or is it skwurl ?
