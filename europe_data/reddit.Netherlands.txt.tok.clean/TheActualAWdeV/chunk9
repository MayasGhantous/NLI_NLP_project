  wow that 's a lot of people in that stadium . 
  i consider `` getting your shit back '' to be a great help though . 
  well it is balkan is n't it ? 
  it 's just that the other countries are more noticeably something else . 
  i would n't count greece as balkan even though it technically is . 
  ignore them , usually . 
  :p although i 'd stick slovenia and croatia in with southern europe maybe . 
  i never really considerd the caucasus countries as european but you could just group those three together as `` caucasus '' . 
  just like the three baltics . 
  they 're all pretty similar anyhow . 
  supposedly . 
  i have n't heard anything about any danes on the dutch news . 
  only some rumours about dutch politicians . 
  `` leftover europe '' can be easily divided into baltics and balkan . 
  durrr there were a few countries missing . 
  wow belgium so low ? 
  i 'm not sure about the netherlands . 
  the golden age was mentioned but so were atrocities in indonesia . 
   as boudicca already defeated mounted armies in the first century . 
  bouddica did n't have an exclusively infantry army and did n't defeated a mounted army though . 
  the romans were mostly infantry and bouddica was trucking around in chariots . 
  if anything , bouddica is the opposite of what you want . 
  i think the point of what makes the guldensporenslag so badical is that it was an army of mostly commoners defeating the cream of the crop french knighthood . 
  knights had been pretty much the way to wage war for a long time by that point and they got beat . 
   [ george washington ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7ivsdrbhnc ), 
  wow . 
  it may be difficult to find a stooge from that house to become a new king though . 
  moscow is a lot less shiny than i 'd 've expected it to be . 
  jesus christ even * my * neck of the woods in the netherlands is brighter than a lot of europe . 
  despite it drawing southerners who come there for the `` peace and quiet '' . 
  is this the icelandic version of `` omnomnom '' ? 
  yeah i do n't think that 's gon na catch on haha, 
  oh right i forgot to mention that `` op z 'n italiaans '' would be `` the italian way '' although i suppose that should be obvious enough . 
  just italians apparently . 
  amazingly enough , i do n't think there 's a german `` style '' of sex in dutch vocabulary . 
  possibly because we do n't think of you guys having sex . 
  like , ever . 
  fucking someone 's knee-hollow is really daft though . 
  possibly dafter than an armpit . 
  `` op z 'n frans '' ( the french way , sort of . 
  hard to translate ) is oral . 
  might be 69 , do n't know . 
  `` op z 'n grieks '' ( the greek way ) is anal . 
  `` op z 'n russisch '' is a titjob . 
  russians , despite having the massivest mammaries i ever saw , were n't familiar with it . 
  a fun one i 've also heard is `` op z 'n engels '' ( the english style ) is faffing about with whips and paddles and that kind of s & m baloney . 
  also ; `` op z 'n italiaans '' is shagging her armpit . 
  not sure if there 's any truth to that . 
  there 's more of us than you may realise . 
  i 'm just riffing on the finnish self-propagated stereotype of not being very social haha, 
  if it 's a language that allows compound words then that 's pretty easy though . 
  i can probably list quite a bunch of words based on `` dog '' in dutch for example . 
  yes . 
  it 's shit . 
  to be fair , the finns ca n't hold a conversation in finnish either . 
  dutch minister of foreign affairs ( i think ) is gon na ask the ambassador for clarification . 
  that 's probably all you can expect from that . 
  those are referred to as `` territory '' and `` resources '' when one is discussing empires . 
  ... and those eurosceptics will now be vindicated because france * will * fly eu flags . 
  perfidious albion indeed . 
  tricksy bastards . 
   `` the way the french brought out the eu flag during the d-day ceremony was like alex salmond waving the scottish flag at wimbledon , '' this implies wwi was all about england . 
  and if that 's their position then i can understand why the eu flag is such a no-no . 
  too bad the position is daft . 
  okay but that 's something completely different than saying `` all empires saw peace as their ultimate goal '' . 
  quite a bunch of empires saw `` get even fricking larger '' as their ultimate goal . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbml1xzdg3w ) nevar forget [ warns ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warns ) !, 
  that 's bollocks mate . 
  their ultimate goal was `` having a big honking empire '' and peace was just a nice bonus . 
  that . . looks both tasty and vaguely depressing . 
  ah yes , nuclear oil . 
  if they do then they did n't invite me . 
   which part of western do you not understand ? 
  why did you even bring up `` western '' in that context ? 
  that 's moving the goalposts . 
  they were specifically talking about it being a cultural problem that is n't inherently linked to islam and then you ask about `` western '' christianity . 
  well , no shit it 's not there . 
  it 's not a western christian cultural problem . 
  but he was n't * talking * about western christianity , you assnut . 
  it 's a cultural thing that probably predates both islam and christianity in the region . 
  it does not depend on either religion and neither religion actually has it as a core tenet . 
  it is , as ollebro said , a * seperate cultural issue * so fuck off with your attempt at misdirection by sneakily challenging him to find a `` western christian country '' . 
  that was n't the damned point and you 're being wilfully dishonest by including it . 
  make a thread about it as a seperate subject , do n't tag along in every thread about fgm and start whining dudilation does n't get the same attention . 
  really bad picture though . 
  that 's no proper sugarbread . 
  eat shit eunavians !, 
  really , that much ? 
  true . 
  it 's finite-ness does n't depend on human consumption though and it 'll probably go out long after humanity is gone . 
  still finite though . 
  were you using dutch as an example ? 
  because it 's estland - letland - litouwen in dutch . 
  you had two out of three . 
  i 'm not sure if this actually makes it * easier * to remember though . 
  all i know is that that is the order from north to south .
