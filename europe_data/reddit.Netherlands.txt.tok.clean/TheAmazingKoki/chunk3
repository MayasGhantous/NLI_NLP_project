  200 bikes ? 
  amateurs ... 
  i do n't think anyone disagrees , but if people want to arrange their daughter 's marriage when she 's under 18 , it 's pretty hard to stop them doing it unless someone reports it to the police . 
  exactly , the refugees are here , and we ca n't change that . 
  the quota system makes sure no one gets fucked over disproportionally . 
  or we could just cooperate , but everyone seems to be too stubborn for that . 
  how about coming up with a proper solution instead of fucking things up further and further for greece ? 
  let 's be honest , that 's not worth the resources . 
  and of course it would be infinitely more complicated if you would factor in legitimate refugees . 
  so you 'd be deported if you lost your wallet ? 
  edit : not to mention the whole innocent until proven guilty thing . 
  last time i checked the punishment for not being able to identify yourself is not deportation though . 
  no , i did n't draw any conclusions . 
  are you doubting the intellect of the people who doubt the intellect of others ? 
  do you have your passport with you at all time ? 
  otherwise you could be deported on that basis . 
  yeah let 's not do that . 
  the thing is , you ca n't really control it . 
  as soon as they land on european soil , you ca n't throw them out if you ca n't prove that they 're not refugees . 
  unless you do n't respect european values , that is . 
  well , what do you suggest ? 
  kicking them out ? 
  because we do n't allow high risk refugees to run abound . 
  the only thing europe is n't doing to limit refugees is straight up kicking them out of europe , which would seriously breach human rights if it can not be proven that they are not refugees . 
  boy who cried wolf kinda deal , maybe . 
  might actually be that twitter is used more often in the netherlands , and because of the colour scheme the grey of english gets blocked out . 
  the media feeds of drama . 
  that 's why you see so many stories of `` a refugee did x '' . 
  not because it 's significant , but because it makes people upset . 
  i have a feeling that this whole refugee crisis might be overblown . 
  it 's just that it 's in the media 's best interest to create a huge drama about it, 
  well that kind of defeats the point , does n't it ? 
  not at all . 
  the eu is not a sinking ship . 
  but i can make another naval analogy out of it if you want . 
  it 's more like a rowing boat , with a couple of strong people and a couple of average people . 
  one of the strong people decides he is better off if he swims , because he disagrees with the other pepole in the boat on some non-issue , and he thinks he should n't have to do any work . 
  he wildly jumps off the boat . 
  he himself will have a harder time , and with one less person capable of pulling the oars , the boat will have a harder time . 
  the eu has plenty of disadvantages but has even more advantages . 
  i think it 'd be pretty inconsiderate to leave . 
  not only will in decrease the stability , but more importantly , the uk would get to profit without really contributing . 
  of course , that 's only if leaving the eu would be profitable to the uk , which i still really really doubt . 
  the only sane words trump seems to speak are about iraq . 
  just because the uk was fine on its own in the past does n't mean it will be in the future . 
  the world has changed immensely . 
  you massively undervalue trade and competition . 
  try to view the eu as a necessary evil . 
  first of all , it 's not an ad hominem . 
  but i guess you want arguments so let 's go . 
  ** growth : ** if you compare growth to bric economies , everything else is a laughing stock . 
  without the eu , uk economy would be even more of a laughing stock . 
  you see , bric economies are playing catch-up . 
  it means that growth rates are higher . 
  when you 're already at the top , it 's no surprise that you 're not growing as fast as the ones catching up . 
  and why are they catching up ? 
  they have stable governments , large populations , low wages and are modernizing . 
  only one could be said about the uk , which is a stable government . 
  because of these factors they have huge export numbers , which gives them profit , which is invested in their own country , which in turn increases productivity through modernisation , and allows them to grow even faster . 
  europe as an union can compete with both bric economies and the current leading economies . 
  uk on it 's own however , has no chance in hell , based on population numbers alone . 
  you see , your productivity can be through the roof , but you still wo n't be able to compete with china because of population differences . 
  europe as a whole , however , has much more potential . 
  ** trade blocks : ** trade blocks are what keeps smaller nations even remotely relevant in global economics . 
  every nation that is n't a bric economy is in a trade block . 
  trade blocks increase export and decrease import costs , which means growth . 
  if the uk was to leave the eu , it would still be in a trade block with the rest of the eu , because of proximity . 
  if the uk really did n't want to be in a trade block and pass measures to prevent efficient trade with the eu , it would be economic suicide . 
  ** unemployment : ** a result of the global crisis . 
  unless the eu was forcing employers to hire less people , there is no way to blame the eu for this . 
  it 's a market mechanism , you could maybe say that the eu has n't done enough to fix it , but it 's really hard to do something about unemployment . 
  you ca n't simply create demand on the labour market . 
  in fact , being in the eu makes it so that it 's more attractive to establish a branch in europe , which decreases unemployment . 
  ** immigration : ** i suppose one way to deter immigrants is to become a less attractive country to live in , because of the bad state of the economy . 
  so that would actually be a great reason to leave the eu : destroy your own economy so immigrants do n't want to go to the uk anymore . 
  ** addendum ** the eu has plenty of issues , and you 'll never see me say that it has n't . 
  right now especially the political structure is largely inefficient . 
  but as you can see i still defend the eu . 
  why ? 
  because the alternative is that much worse . 
  yeah you do n't understand growth or trade blocks . 
  the uk should * want * to stay in the eu because it benefits them , the only reason people are against it is because of their concern with the british indentity and legacy , which is just stupid in my opinion . 
  the times of brittania rule the waves are over , and are not coming back . 
  leaving the eu really wo n't change that . 
  well , yeah , but that does n't mean that the eu wants them to . 
  and aside from that , being in the eu is also positive for investments , since collecively it 's the biggest economy in the world . 
  and i really do n't see why you would want to leave the biggest economy in the world . 
  guess what , the uk gets hit way harder than the eu . 
  russia is more powerful than the uk , and they 're being absolutely wrecked by eu sanctions , while they have oil to export . 
  and no one in the eu is desperate for the uk to stay . 
  barely anyone in the eu talks about it , it 's just the eu skeptic media in the uk who pretend that the uk is so important to the eu , which also helps to make the people in the uk think that the uk will be better off without the eu . 
  cameron knows that the uk is better off in the eu , he 's not stupid . 
  he 's just hoping that the eu will play ball so he can be the tough guy . 
  the main reason why eu countries do n't want the uk to leave is because it will decrease the stability of the eu . 
  in today 's globalizing world , with growing interdependency , leaving the eu will * always * be bad economically . 
  not to mention your biggest trade partners are all eu countries . 
  `` they are refugees not `` immigrants '' . 
  most of them are also able and willing to adapt , work and live by the rules of their host countries . 
  it 's gon na be a huge social success , as there is some great cooperation already ... 
  if germany is the only one who wants them , they are the only ones to gain , which would n't be very nice , so they should try to let other countries benefit as well through quotas . '',
