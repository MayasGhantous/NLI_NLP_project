  and you claim that from that quote it was apparent that  there were historical problems that we have failed to realise . 
  whilst i am saying that this is not the case , because the historical problems in said quote are about an extremist group within islam and that we are fully aware of these problems . 
  well i do n't think that  there were historical problems that we have failed to realise . 
  as we 're just as much aware now of the problems with radical islam as churchill was . 
  so i do n't see how his quote shows that there are historical problems that we have failed to realise . 
   so i guess there were historical problems that we have failed to realise . 
  well not really . 
  we realise there are problems with extremist parts of islam but not with islam in its entirety , just as they did then . 
  the quote of churchill was about an extremist sect of islam . 
  in reality churchill was very fond of mainstream islam and some family members even worried that churchill might have converted . 
  yes , he would because churchill loved islam and would hate to see the dislike of it today . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11314580/sir-winston-churchill-s-family-feared-he-might-convert-to-islam.html in the quote of / u/bonkersforbunkers he was only saying that about an extremist sect of islam that he encountered during a war in sudan . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11314580/sir-winston-churchill-s-family-feared-he-might-convert-to-islam.html in your quote he only referred to a single sect of islam . 
  from the article :  in his book the river war ( 1899 ) -- his account of the frontier wars of india and sudan -- he was scathing of the fundamentalist , ultra conservative mahdiyya form of islam adopted by the dervish population of north africa . 
  he states : `` how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries ... improvident habits , slovenly systems of agriculture , sluggish methods of commerce ... 
  the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it . '' he very much liked islam , he just did n't like the extremists parts of it . 
  that is a whole lot more progressive/nuanced than you make him seem . 
  i just feel sorry for martina . 
  this was supposed to be his last race , and he lost a gold medal in it thanks to a disqualification :\\ . 
   he has never been elected on his own merits ( he only got a seat in the dutch parliament because he managed to weasel his way up on the list of the second-largest party ) , and look where he is today . 
  like 99 % of our politicians ? 
  pretty sure he was able to do that because he is as you said `` a political genius '' and a brilliant diplomat . 
  that 's called politics , not ` weaseling ' . 
   he planned this speech very carefully , because he is an ambitious and ruthless man . 
  as opposed to people that are not ruthless or rats , they improvise their speeches ... all though i will give you that people that are not ambitious are likely to not plan their speeches . 
   before the united nations and convinced our premier to send him to brussels so he could not be called to answer before parliament . 
  pm has no authority to do this . 
  juncker requested him to become vice-president of the european commission . 
   in a few years , when people in brussels see through his fake emotions pretty sure they 're not fake , only exaggerated . 
   he will return as the leader of the pvda ( labour ) , go into television debates with several emotional moments prepared in advance , have his become the second-largest party and still become premier due to an underhanded political compromise . 
  bold prediction ... 
   geenstijl uses sources other than themselves and give their opinion . . waarom link je die dan niet in plaats van geenstijl ? 
  thanks for proving me right ^_^, 
   how you are going to prove anything with anecdote ? 
  as opposed to your very well linked sources ? 
  / s i can list sources that rape in sweden has not significantly increased . 
  a frequently cited source when comparing swedish rape statistics internationally is [ the regularly published report by the united nations office on drugs and crime ( unodc ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_office_on_drugs_and_crime ) , based on official statistics provided by each member state . 
  in 2012 , sweden had [ 66 cases of reported rapes per 100,000 population , according to the swedish national council for crime prevention ] ( https://web.archive.org/20140714125901/http://www.bra.se/download/18.22a7170813a0d141d21800061146/1364311914171/100la-2012.xls ) ( br\u00e5 ) . 
  [ excel file ] this was unequivocally [ the biggest number reported to the unodc in 2012 . 
  ] ( http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/cts2013_sexualviolence.xls ) [ excel file ] however , widely differing legal systems , offence definitions , terminological variations , recording practices and statistical conventions makes any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19592372 https://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/news-from-bra/archive/news/2011-01-18-how-common-is-rape-in-sweden-compared-to-other-european-countries.html http://kunskapsbanken.nck.uu.se/nckkb/nck/publik/fil/visa/197/different https://dx.doi.org/10.1023%2fa%3a1008713631586 which is why the unodc itself caution against using their figures . 
  it should also be noted that many countries [ do not report any rape statistics at all to the unodc ] ( http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur--nojen/att-tolka-statistik/ ) , and some report very low numbers , despite studies that indicate otherwise . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/health-24021573 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/piis2214-109x%2813%2970069-x/fulltext [ the swedish police record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately , leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries . 
  ] ( http://www.amnesty.dk/sites/default/files/mediafiles/44/case-closed.pdf ) sweden also has a comparatively wide definition of rape . 
  this means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries . 
  for example , in 2005 sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider . 
  http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/fler-brott-bedoms-som-valdtakt/ http://www.nck.uu.se/kunskapscentrum/kunskapsbanken/amnen/sexuellt_vald/sexualbrottslagstiftningen/ http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sverige/valdtaktsbegreppet-vidgas-i-forslag/ which led to a marked increase in reports . 
  http://polistidningen.se/2007/06/viktigt-att-valdtaktsoffer-blir-trodda/ http://www.nck.uu.se/kunskapscentrum/kunskapsbanken/myndigheter/myndighetspublikationer/?id=31 for this reason , large-scale victimisation surveys have been presented by criminologists as a more reliable indicator of rape prevalence . 
  an eu-wide survey on sexual violence against women , published [ the european union agency for fundamental rights ( fra ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fundamental_rights_agency ) in 2014 , [ showed sweden was only third highest , below denmark and finland ] ( http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2014-vaw-survey-main-results_en.pdf ) and a previous assessment by br\u00e5 have placed sweden at an average level among european nations . 
  according to the fra study there 's a strong correlation between higher levels of gender equality and disclosure of sexual violence . 
  [ this , and a greater willingness among swedish women to report rape in relationships ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/flest-valdtakter-i-sverige/ ) , may also explain the relatively high rates of reported rape in sweden , which has a long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation , as well as an established women 's movement , and [ has been ranked as the number one country in sex equality . 
  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6167486.stm ) take a look at [ this picture ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/rate_of_exposure_to_sexual_offences_unchanged_2005-2013.svg ) . 
  blue is often the graph used to ` prove ' that rape in sweden has been increasing at a worrying rate , it is however just the graph of reported sex crimes which the swedish justice system artificially increases by reporting each sexual assault involving only one victim/rapist as an individual report . 
  the red line is the amount of rape cases ( including cases where the suspect was found innocent ) and green is the graph showing the number of people exposed to sexual offences ( with the decimal number indicating the percentage of the population that this number is ) . 
  and lo and behold , no significant increase . 
  even if the percentage of people in sweden being migrants/asylum seekers is increasing and those people are more prone to making sexual offences , it is not enough to affect swedish rape statistics . 
  yes , very sure . 
  it says so near the username : [ deleted ] . 
  which means the person in question deleted their own account ( and the post with it ) . 
   the problem is that there are no go zones in sweden . 
  even the 60 minutes group from australia got attacked for simply filming in place with migrants . 
  wow . 
  turns out that in neighbourhoods with high crime rates people are often attacked/assaulted . 
  who would 've thought ? 
  my sister was once attacked with fireworks whilst delivering mail in a completely white neighbourhood . 
  neighbourhoods simply exist where assholes pile up . 
  there are neighbourhoods where these assholes are migrants and were these assholes are not . 
  even counting those , crime is still among the lowest in history and has no upward trend . 
  just because bad neighbourhoods exist , does n't mean there 's anything wrong with the country or that the country is getting worse . 
   yes , sweden is very nice place to live today when they can afford it . 
  but how about in 20-years when majority of working swedes today retire and the demographics of those of working age are heavily changed in favor of mena migrants . 
  they are n't . 
  oh that would explain why we could n't find it anymore . 
  i 've seen it posted . 
  i think yesterday or two days ago , let me look it up . 
  where are these supposed ` leftist and feminists ' doing this ? 
  i am very much at the left side of the spectrum , very much at the progressive end and i think we should take in migrants but i am fully aware it was people of mainly north african descent . 
  why are ` rightists ' ( this works both ways ) so adamant on attacking straw men like this ? 
  just because people disagree on the solution of a problem ( improving integration , the economic situation of migrants and combating discrimination versus limiting migration , ethnic profiling and closing borders ) does n't mean they deny that there is a problem . 
  it 's a discussion i also often have with my father . 
  whenever he says we should just hang every muslim , me and my mom roll our eyes and he tells us how naive we are to the islamic problem . 
  in fact , we do not deny there is a problem with islam , we just severely disagree on the method to solve it . 
   sweden is n't magically going to turn into worse , it 's being made into . 
  by actions such as this . 
  no , it 's not . 
  yes , there 's been these sexual assault issues but it is hardly a pending disaster . 
  places like sweden are still among the safest on earth and they will remain that way for decades to come . 
  this is the ` typical / r/europe panick ' that / u/grenspa talks about . 
  you read a couple of articles about an event were a group of women were sexually assaulted and immediately pretend like crime has skyrocketed . 
  do you know that research has shown that the safer a country is , the more severely people react to hearing news of crimes like this ? 
  apparently living in a safe country makes crime more shocking , giving the illusion that more of it is happening . 
  but when you actually look at the statistics , there 's no upwards trend . 
   europe ends at the bosporous and the ural mountains so kazakhstan is european now ? 
  kazakhstan has territory on the european sides of the ural mountains . 
  turkey has territory on the european side of the bosporous , is turkey european now ? 
  is armenia european or is it not ? 
  is cyprus part of europe ? 
  if islands are a separate thing from the continent , are sicilia and sardinia not european even though they 're part of a european country ? 
  and you said europe ended with the bosporous and the ural mountains , but that only covers the east . 
  where in the atlantic does europe end ?
