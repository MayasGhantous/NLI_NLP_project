  frisia was a name simply derived from the people that inhabited the area , the frisians . 
  frisian comes from frisii which means curly hair . 
   i do n't have an issue with you having an opinion . 
  it 's the `` how dare you lie to the entire reddit community , you 've let us all down '' approach that pissed me off . 
  well that 's your problem . 
  if you post stuff that is partially incorrect , be prepared to face the consequences . 
  that 's why you always should check before posting . 
   the prevalent theory is that the name originated in the gallo-roman period and comes from the latin antverpia . 
  antverpia would come from ante ( before ) verpia ( deposition , sedimentation ) , indicating land that forms by deposition in the inside curve of a river ( which is in fact the same origin as germanic waerpen ) . 
  note that the river scheldt , before a transition period between 600 to 750 , followed a different track . 
  this must have coincided roughly with the current ringway south of the city , situating the city within a former curve of the river . 
  then you 're posting in the wrong place since this comment chain was about the ` ireland , uk and part of mainland europe with their literal place names . ', 
  map . 
  i 've circled your mistake : http://i.imgur.com/iwyouvk.jpg, 
   this is getting silly . 
  you are n't an expert in this matter , nor am i. i 've already caught an error that you made in the `` land of the free '' discussion , so get off your high horse . 
  no you have n't . 
  indeed , neither of us are experts , but you are the guy who is wrong here . 
  you are the guy posting wrong maps . 
  also , i am not speculating , i am directly quoting experts . 
   i just fixed a mistake you made in the thread about `` the land of the free . '', 
  it took me less than five minutes to find a source that you said did n't exist . 
  yes , you ` fixed ' that . 
  i believe you when you say that sweden is called ` the land of the free ' , but the area labeled ` land of the free ' on your map is n't sweden . 
   do n't claim to be an expert when you 're not . 
  i never claimed to be an expert . 
  also , me not being an expert does n't mean i do n't have a point . 
  i misread the map ? 
   the `` northern parts of the netherlands and germany '' is labelled `` land of the natives . '', 
  i did n't know you spelled ` natives ' as f , r , e , e ? 
   but `` land of the free '' is what 's written over sweden . 
  the thing called ` land of the free ' on the map is not sweden . 
  then the name is incorrectly placed on the map . 
  sweden is n't located in the northern parts of the netherlands and germany . 
   i know about mercury . 
  i 've read roman myths . 
  because reading roman myths makes you an experts in the etymology of the names of their gods . 
   i have no reason to think that you have the education or experience to make definitive statements about these matters . 
  i have no reason to think that you have the education or experience to make definitive statements about these matters . 
  so do n't come here posting your weird maps here . 
  you come here with a map , without checking if it 's actually right and then you 're going to complain when people tell you what 's wrong with it ? 
   much as you described yourself as `` too lazy '' to check all the place names on the map , i likewise did not proofread the entire thing , nor do i claim that i have studied the history of place names to the point that i would be able to resolve issues of etymology that must often be hard to resolve , given that we have an incomplete historical record . 
  never post something if you do not know whether you 're right or not . 
   there might be errors on the map ; alternatively , there might be different theories about the proper root of a place 's name , with the author picking one that you do n't know about . 
  i always look at multiple sources . 
  whatever source you 're author was using , it 's a source that is not common and not widely accepted by linguistics . 
  no , it does however mean that you 're in favor of it being on the tv since you have n't got anything against keeping it on tv . 
  tolerating something comes pretty close to supporting something , however i agree . 
  it should be 3 options : 1 ) i support the monarchy 2 ) i do n't care 3 ) i do n't support the monarchy . 
   i know all that . 
  apparently you do n't because you 're giving the wrong information . 
   i did n't say they had the same meaning . 
  you are saying by posting this map that the name mercurius means ` the trader ' which it does n't . 
  what source tells you this ? 
  belgium comes from the latin name of the tribe that used to inhabit the region , the belgae . 
  the general consensus among linguists is that the ethnic name belgae comes from the proto-celtic root * belg - or * bolg - meaning `` to swell ( particularly with anger/battle fury/etc . 
  ) '' , cognate with the dutch adjective gebelgd , `` to be very angry '' and verbolgen , `` being angry '' , and the old english verb belgan , `` to be angry '' ( from proto-germanic * balgiz ) , derived ultimately from the proto-indo-european root * bhelgh - ( `` to swell , bulge , billow '' ) . 
  thus , a proto-celtic ethnic name * bolg\u012b could be interpreted as `` the people who swell ( particularly with anger/battle fury ) '' .

  merchandise = the trader ? 
  a trader sells merchandise . 
  they are not the same word . 
  the translation of ` the trader ' is given on this map because of a confusion . 
  the planets are named after roman gods . 
  mercury 's name literally came from the word merchandise and because people see mercury as a person , his name is translated to the word you could give to a person that comes closest : the trader . 
  mercury 's name does n't mean ` the trader ' . 
  you did post it here . 
  i 'm calling bullshit on the planet 's names . 
  mercury probably comes from the word ` merx ' meaning ` merchandise ' . 
  earth comes from ` er ' meaning ` ground ' . 
  moon comes from ` me ( n ) ses ' which means ` month ' or luna comes from lux , lumen ` light , ' lucere ` to shine ' . 
  there is even more wrong with it but i 'm lazy to correct you any further . 
  no they had n't . 
  unlike english , old dutch looks a lot like modern dutch . 
  for example amsterdam : amster = amstel ( river ) dam = dam . 
  amsterdam is literally amstel dam . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  edit : also , the name of the northern region ( land of the free ) is not correct either . 
  that 's the land were the frisians and anglicans came from . 
  i 'm pretty sure that it 's actually called [ ` land of the frisians ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frisia ) and not ` land of the free ' . 
  there is no source calling it the land of the free . 
  so ... one of us . 
  one of us . 
  one of us . 
  one of us . 
  the narrator speaks so boringly . 
  yes , things like archaeology and paleontology are of course much more objective . 
  history is a biased science . 
  what we know of our history has to come from the written/spoken records of people that were alive at the time ( or in some cases just after it ) . 
  since no human is unbiased we can not get true objective knowledge . 
  we do n't have infinite money :p . 
  thinking of the area around germany when you hear europe is neither wrong nor right . 
  the map is n't misleading . 
  the map shows what land the separatist/autonomist movements claim , not where their supporters are situated . 
  we just put up a tree and come together with both sides of the family . 
  there is no real talk about anything religious .
