   only happens if you do n't have an anti-russian pov . 
  nope . 
  it only happens if you do n't have an anti-kremlin pov . 
  there are multiple russians here we like and enough people explicitly saying they do n't have anything against russia , but the actions of the kremlin which are harming both us and the russians themselves . 
  do n't assume that just because we do n't agree with your pro-kremlin standpoint , we 're anti-russian . 
   i give up , saying anything that is n't obviously anti-russian on this subreddit is pointless . 
  haha .

   we can figure out who is right and who is guilty later . 
  the mistake gorbachev makes there is that putin does n't care who 's really guilty and who 's not . 
  he is accusing the west and ukraine of stuff , not because he necessarily thinks it 's the truth . 
  it 's a means to an end . 
  yes , so why do you have to tell me ? 
  i know . 
  but op was talking about belgium , the netherlands and germany so i said those three i know of have no tipping culture . 
  according to the russians , a secret russian ship is not looking for a submarine that 's not in trouble and the netherlands deny shadowing that ship . 
  yep . 
  neither of those three countries have a tipping culture . 
  tipping is honestly mostly an american thing , so ... 
  most people seem to support russia 's actions and russia 's import bans . 
  so i do n't feel bad for them at all , they want this . 
  feel bad for the minority of non-putin supporters .

  drafting is n't exchanging your life . 
  drafted men ( and women now ) are n't send to war zones . 
  they only get a couple months basic training . 
  if you exchange your life there for something , you did something very wrong during your training . 
  oh , i have a much better one :  putin 's russia  sustainable pick 1 . :d, 
  then it still fits the definition . 
  if you can keep something flying and only material degradation is a limiting factor , most people would agree you 've achieved sustainable flight .

  or upvote because photoshop might even make it sarcastically funny . 
   nato film reveals their version of the truth about soviet occupation * indeed . 
  the soviet occupation was essentially a russian occupation as the soviet union was russian ruled . 
  the polish , czechs and other nationalities who we 're occupied by the soviet union ( read : russia ) will have a different view of the occupation as russia itself . 
  they 're much more closer to the truth than the russians .

  what do i do with this ? 
  well i think that 's more favourable than getting into such a downward spiral that you drag the entire continent down with you . 
  the tax haven problem can be solved after the crisis is over . 
  we 're already busy solving it . 
   question is , when will it hit the bottom ? 
  the stock exchange 101 .

  no , i am 2 . 
   and yet you were the one starting to answer him with pointless yes , because i thought : let 's start with the annoying bits , then that will be over as soon as possible . 
   o since you knew from the beginning that this can not end in a civil discussion , there is only one reason for your comments : you are trying to be a douche by provoking a reaction with your childish comments . 
  and that is a line of attack a 3 year old would come up with . 
  point proven ? 
  essentially . 
  yes . 
  because serious discussion is n't really possible , i might as well make a bit ' o fun . 
   and that is a line of attack a 3 year old would come up with . 
  i 'd say 5 years old . 
  3 years probably are n't as good with english yet . 
  it looks a bit like you then ? 
  embarrassing . 
  yes , the difference is : if both could come to a compromise and are not blind to the other 's point of view , the discussion will most likely act civilized . 
  if both people have completely opposite stances and they refuse to see each other 's point of view , the discussion will get worse and worse . 
  me and kwonza are the second case . 
  we are both on complete different ends of the spectrum in this case and we will never get each other . 
  a debate between us two will only end up like mindless accusing each other of bunches of stuff . 
  if the first case is happening , i am more than willing to debate . 
  sadly , the first case is impossible here . 
  except a majority on this subreddit it seems . 
  oh and at least half of ukraine . 
   compared to your responses he seems to be the civil guy in this thread here . 
  i know that what i said smarty . 
  of course i look like the idiot . 
  what i 'm doing right now is the same thing that will happen eventually if we discuss seriously ( a putin supporter vs a anti-putin supporter will always end up in childish arguing ) so i 'm just saving us time be getting it over with immediately in the beginning . 
   if you are trying to get a message through . 
  think about it . 
  i do n't need to get a message through . 
  as i said : discussing on the internet is pointless if neither people are going to agree or accept one another 's argument either way . 
   he 'll probably wreck you in a real argument in a matter of seconds anyway .
