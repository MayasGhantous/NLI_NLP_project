  it did n't work like that . 
  i know the holy spirit is part of god , but god did n't literally tell them what to write down . 
  he inspired them what to write down indirectly . 
  this makes the bible not the direct literal word of god , but rather as the inspired word of god . 
   the quran on the other hand was , again , written by mohammed who was guided by gabriel , the archangel . 
  yes , but what gabriel told mohammed was exactly what god wanted gabriel to tell mohammed , making it the direct literal word of god . 
   now , again ... using your argument , which of the two have a more direct connection to god in their handing down as the word of god ? 
  none as i do n't believe in any . 
  if you ask religious people though , you 'll see that the quran is considered to be more directly connected to god by muslims than christians consider the bible to be . 
  same , a while ago there was a video on / r/thenetherlands using children in the whole islam debate . 
  to be honest , if the russians were trying to convey this message with their propaganda it would n't be that bad . 
  sadly they are n't . 
  i can also quote two bits from the quran and then claim that the entire book is good . 
  i can also quote two bits from the bible and then claim that the entire book is evil . 
  does n't make it actually true . 
  actually , most religious experts do agree that the quran is considered to be the word of god , whilst the bible is n't . 
  the people that wrote the bible were guided by the holy spirit , god did n't literally instruct them what exactly to write . 
  the quran is entirely based on what mohammed said , and mohammed said what god told him to . 
  so the bible was written by men inspired by god , whilst the quran is a direct copy of what god told mohammed . 
  thus christians do not see the bible as the literal word of god , whilst muslims do see the quran as the literal word of god . 
   2nd an 3rd generaion of muslims in europe are the same as their neighbours because of education and prosperity . 
  to be the devil 's advocate : that is not entirely true . 
  in general the first generation immigrants were the well behaved . 
  they come from a time when islam was a lot less plagued by people like isis trying to force it unto people with violence and a lot of them came here in order to flee extremist islam . 
  generations of muslims that have lived here all their lives are more likely to idolize islam . 
  nor should we confuse that the hadith are all taken as true . 
  some hadith are generally believed to be true , some hadith are considered bullshit by a vast majority of islam . 
  hadith are indirectly sourced texts . 
  whilst the quran is taken as the literal word of god , the hadith are collections of stories from people around the prophet . 
  some from direct family members of mohammed , some are from cousins of cousins of cousins of brothers of cousins . 
  the hadith about the virgins you get in heaven for doing the jihad for example is a terribly sourced hadith that is believed by almost zero muslims . 
  you need to be careful before using a hadith in an islam argument , do n't use the ones that are terribly sourced . 
  euhm , when you type in : `` why is georgia so '' and you click `` why is georgia so racist ? '', 
  it gives you the us state , not the country . 
  yes , that was an actual ad hominem . 
  good observation !, 
  i am not resorting to personal attacks , you are a personal attack on yourself . 
  you do n't need me for that . 
  i just said : * facepalm *, 
  yes , * facepalm * . 
  * facepalm *, 
   you do n't get it . 
  when someone at college age has children it mostly ends up in a breakup because the guy and girl ca n't take care of a child and study at the same time . 
  pretty sure the majority of the baby 's were born after the program was finished . 
  but for how long ? 
  the truce can still fail and the oil price is projected to never go back to 80 $ again , the price russia really needs . 
  not to include that russia is also using a lot of it 's reserves , does n't this also prevent the ruble from falling ? 
  i never said they were libyans , i only said they were coming in from libya . 
  sadly morocco is n't the issue . 
  pretty much 2/3rd of illegal immigrants come from libya , where the government has lost sight on a lot of things . 
  i had that second one as a background for a long while :d, 
  yes , but was that the real reason ? 
  i 'd figure first and foremost the reason was that removing opponents of the regime was good for the regime , communism came second . 
   ethnic cleansing and displacement are not an unknown concept to soviet union . 
  to be honest , i do n't think the soviet union did this for the greater good of communism , but to remove opponents of the regime . 
   and open borders are definitely ruining europe !, 
  each time i go to the other eu country without showing my passport i totally feel like i ruined it a little bit more . 
  i ca n't help but imagine when i read that , this [ video ] ( http://youtu.be/vh209ku0kis?t=2m25s ) , but instead of steve on the beach , a pole walking across multiple european borders , getting angrier every time he crosses one . 
  i was angry that these borders were so open and no border guard was even trying to violate me . '', 
  op , this is what you said on / r/worldnews 3 days ago :  i embrace nsa , chicago pd , torture and the necessary instruments to govern the masses .

  did n't you read the article  :( ? 
  slovakia is not beautiful , the mountains are n't nice . 
   we are a declining continent , economically we 're starting to become irrelevant in the world , demographically we 're declining , we lagging behind in nearly everything in science and industry . 
  [ excuse you !,

  oh , you believe nato falling apart = nuclear war . 
  that 's naive . 
  according to whom ? 
  i do n't see what is so funny ? 
  from 4chan : one hitler is equal to 6.0 * 10 ^ 6 human lives . 
  standard si prefixes apply , so harold shipman 's achievements amount to 36 microhitlers . 
  epa currently values a human life at 6,9 million dollars or 6,9 megadollars . 
  1 hitler is thus equal to 41.400.000.000.000 dollars or about 41 teradollars . 
  when the us congress failed to deliver the stimulus bill in 2008 , the market lost 1,2 trillion dollars in 1 day , roughly 29 millihitlers . 
  joseph stalin clocked roughly 5 hitlers . 
  if you get a 35 dollar fine , you can claim that you 've been fucked over for 84 picohitlers . 
  first of : that wikipedia page does n't exist because you have the name incorrectly spelled . 
  the name is : ** friesland ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friesland of which the english name is : ** frisia ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frisia secondly : we are not scandinavians . 
  we are anglo-frisian . 
  which is part of the west-germanic ethnicity , not the north-germanic . 
  thirdly : we are/were a peasant region often disregarded by the holy roman empire because the region was n't useful seeing as it was mostly swamp and wetlands . 
  whether ` nobility ' you were from , they were the rulers of peasant villages , hardly worthy of the title 'em peror ' . 
  fourthly : there is no such thing as a ` mini-emperor ' . 
  kaiser is just german for 'em peror ' . 
  maybe you need to learn history , because you whole ancestry conflicts itself : you claim to be a scandinavian descendent from a not-scandinavian region , whilst claiming to be a descendent from a noble title that does not exist nor has an equivalent in the region you claim to be originally from . 
  this freisland ? 
  where the fuck lies ` freisland ' ? 
  yeah , what kind of backwards homo country is this ? 
  they are very conservative islamist . 
  their previous leader , erdogan ( who is now president ) , once claimed that muslims discovered america first and so on . 
  they 're also rumoured to be is-sympathetic . 
  one of their main points lately was to give more powers to the president ( aka , their previous leader ) who has autocratic tendencies . 
  sorry , what ? 
  i know right ? 
  i too was first against it just a few months back . 
  changed my mind after learning more economics and discussing it with some friends . 
  if the problem is , as the core of your argument claims , institutional bias , why would n't you want your citizens to be protected from it ? 
  it 's only a small institutional bias . 
  as you said , here in the west judges are often as objective as can be .
