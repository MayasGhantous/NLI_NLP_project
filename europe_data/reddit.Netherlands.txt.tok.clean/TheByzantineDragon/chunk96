  go ahead then . 
   the traitorous globalists who brought france to her knees are to blame for the current predicament . 
  fine , but as i said . 
  i wo n't be replying to any of those then . 
  have a nice day , 
   yeah if he brought it for bears chances are its pretty remote and police ca n't teleport plus why would he abandon his stuff ? 
  pretty sure it 's not remote . 
  he was on a beach with a drunken person there . 
  i 'm sure that 's not somewhere in the middle of yellowstone park . 
   self defense is a right but if you can discourage someone from doing physical harm to you by merely bringing out a gun that 's not unreasonable . 
  it is unreasonable . 
  it 's vigilantism and can only lead to more violence and people take justice into their own hands . 
  then we would be like the united states , and we need to prevent that from happening . 
  yes , it is . 
  i am getting dozens of replies from you on a dozen different comment chains . 
  if you want to discuss do it in one comment chain , but do n't put 8 comments in my inbox every few seconds . 
  i am done responding to your spamming .

   and respond accordingly which is not to pull out a gun , but to leave and get security or the police .

  the threat exist , but a threat is not an attack . 
  we do n't allow vigilantes to threaten , hurt or kill others with weaponry simply because they 're being threatened . 
  that 's anarchy . 
  exactly . 
  you do n't know , that 's my it 's stupid to pull a gun out immediately . 
  good . 
  stay there . 
  we 'll keep our safe countries , you 'll keep your high crime rate . 
  i am done responding to your spamming . 
  if you 're going to do petty insults , do n't do it with a username as `` dumkopf604 '' . 
  which i would put under hurting or killing . 
  you 're using the fact that the gun can kill or hurt to threaten . 
   so that 's why 99.99 % of guns in the us do n't do any of that ? 
  if i do n't use 99,99 % of my cutlery does n't mean it 's not meant to not eat food with . 
  you defend yourself by causing others to get killed or hurt or by threatening to do so . 
  this was a response to a comment that included a link i posted . 
  that explains it . 
  he threatened . 
  go ahead then . 
  pull out a gun near someone who 's mental or near someone who 's being threatened . 
  do n't come crying back here when suddenly that person pulls a knife and stabs or pulls out a gun too . 
  defend himself against what ? 
  he was n't being attacked , there was only a drunken person who apparently was being threatening . 
  we 're goign down hill rapidly if we allow anyone to just pull out a gun everytime they feel threatened . 
  fine , then move to the us . 
  we do n't want gun slinging vigilantes here . 
  we do n't live in 4000 bc . 
  we do n't live in a society with the rule `` an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . '', 
   not provoke , discourage you have no idea which of the two a gun is going to do before hand . 
  obviously not . 
  but you do n't threaten him with gun violence . 
  then it would 've been even more stupid to provoke him with a weapon . 
  the police do . 
  you 've named an example where children was sexually abused but not taken seriously . 
  i do n't think you fit into that category . 
  it was a scandal of a local police authority . 
  hardly a reason to start stockpiling guns . 
  what were you going to do with guns against this ? 
  shoot as many of those pakistanis as possible ? 
  that does n't justify pulling out a gun . 
  [ hijabs in iran ] ( https://www.sfiran.com/uploads/posts/featured_image/1464275520zcbhhpuaeazbbuvt9iyo.jpeg ) [ another iranian hijab ] ( http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/breitbart/breitbart-london/2014/03/10/ashton-hijab.png ) [ and again ] ( http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2014-05/18/133342806_14004111724521n.jpg ) iran is relatively lenient with hijabs . 
  all women are required to wear one , but they often ignore details such as hair locks coming out . 
  you can even have a transparant hijab to a certain degree . 
   no the police in the uk have a track record of ignoring islamic crime oh . 
  apparently we 've already reached that mad max future . 
  what year is it ? 
   but i can see a situation where a gun could defuse a violent situation . 
   could yeah it could . 
  or it could escalate the situation to perhaps even lethal effect . 
  the person as said was drunk and aggressive . 
  you have no idea how such a person might react to being threatened with a gun . 
  this makes it irresponsible . 
  and yet he used it to threaten a human , not a bear . 
  that 's just irresponsible . 
  for that to ever happen there should first be neckbeards interested in a job as police officer . 
  but i do n't think they 'd pass the physical tests . 
  how is that related ?

  which past mistakes ? 
  killing and hurting is the intended and designed use , and it is thus pointless to have a gun if you 're not willing to use it to hurt or kill . 
  he de-escalated the situation with the threat of using the gun to do violence . 
  so he was using it as intended . 
   it bears saying , for instance , that firearms are liberally available in countries that do n't have a lot of problems with them . 
  apparently there 's even big differences between american states , which all leads to the same conclusion : banning firearms does not automatically lead to a safer society . 
  yes , the important factor is culture . 
  america has a high availability of guns and also a lot of crime . 
  switzerland has a high availability but does n't have that much crime . 
  the sad truth is that in the rest of europe , we do not have swiss gun culture . 
  if we wanted to allow guns without sacrificing safety , we would have to adopt swiss gun culture . 
  this includes things like drafting young adults into the army and making that a requirement for owning a gun . 
  swiss also regularly train with them . 
  you ca n't really make dutch or british society do that . 
  so banning does help if the culture is simply not compatible with the liberal sale of guns .
