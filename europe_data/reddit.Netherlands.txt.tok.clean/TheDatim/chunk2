  you have not eaten it yet ? 
  you should , definitely . 
  apparently it 's de jong here ... 
  that 's really interesting, 
  no , but damned right am i interested in knowing how the legend started , and none of that new age talk, 
  i barely watch tv and i can technically be considered younger as i am 16 , although the word young is relative, 
  a german already answered and you ignored and then offended his answer by telling such and old and stale joke also going against what he said you should . 
  your reddit would be filled with ragegasms for a solid month , and just for one nation fucking up, 
  coffee shops ? 
  what do i know how many projects are in there ? 
  i 'm stoned when there, 
  it always shocks americans that our healthcare is both mandatory and actually covers good healthcare , partly by letting you choose, 
  king fury, 
  everything goes pretty well until you get to the pvv, 
  as a non-native speaker , english curse words are just words to be reserved for certain occasions , but i never use twat , it sounds too feminine to me and i do n't want to be mistaken for team rocket, 
  first a reaction to edit 2 : you also is a plural word , pointing at a group , so this is , as far as generalisations go , and generalisations are warranted by the question asked , totally fair . 
  now my highest-on-my-list reason : the us seems to straight up bomb every country and ideology they do n't like , if they are small enough to be trampled . 
  i do n't appreciate this bullying being thrown around as `` policing '', 
  i feel really vulnerable compared to the other state animals , but at least we fit in as a bird, 
  then you just say `` good day cunt '' , at least with my friends, 
  they already did m8 , he commented too, 
  best plan i have yet heard, 
  i cooked some rice, 
  as people , what 's the deal ? 
  i see this rebel is from flanders, 
  southern neighbour ? 
  you mean that territory we have yet to annex ? 
  welcome fellow dutchman/dutchwoman ** banter banter banter **, 
   also our guns have improved too i hope your gun laws have as well, 
  again , not everything is to be taken as seriously about all americans , it 's just that so many people in the deep south appear to believe that islam is bad at its core . 
  also : did you see the hidden message ? 
  the clogs , seriously people , we do n't wear them anymore , only tourists do !, 
  the food is very ~ ~ healthy ~ ~ abundant his royal majesty trump plays an * interesting * monarch every smaller party has no chance i believe they bomb too much really , the only electoral choices they have are democrat or republican bomb everyone they do n't like extra gluten for nocebo effect in average american every choice is limited to two political parties ready to bomb their `` enemies '' and enemies interested in communism/islam ? 
  bad country * bombing intensifies * sweet , carbon emissions ftw weary of other ideologies all people have guns the gun laws are way too non-existent everyone has guns republicans or democrats , other parties have no chance -- -- -- -- -- these are my stereotypes about americans , do n't take all very seriously also : anyone who saw that i spelled a real thing americans need to know , good on you !, 
  yes , i know , but that word is derived from the latin word for island , is n't it ? 
  every turk i meet with on this sub and r/europe has told me , well , every turk not an erdogan bot, 
  yeah , two years of middelbare school , like you are gon na remember much of that by the time you are 18, 
  yeah , the coup , that turned out was orchestrated by erdogan ... 
  actually it 's widely accepted that there were 2 million protesters , not 100.000, 
  unified ? 
  i do n't really think there is a peaceful solution fit that , so no federalized ? 
  yes !, 
  also colonies ca n't be self-governing, 
  damned right indos ( mixed dutch-indonesian ) have good food , i love my culture, 
  interesting , i did not know your word for condo means island, 
  it 's called * tap water * * banter banter banter *, 
  ahhh , why would somebody do that ? 
  we do n't have to learn german in school, 
  my version of german is dutch so i 'm less excited, 
  yeah , i agree , we should annex you rebels again, 
  it plays minor roles , as we have a history ( almost left it at that ) of multiculturalism and freedom of religion for hundreds of years , so it 's engrained , this is way less so in the us . 
  oh good the potential controversy . 
  geert wilders sure knows how to run a campaign on ** not getting sharia law **, 
  i personally really like the icelandic flag, 
  what ? 
  having sex before marriage and not getting caught and kicked out ? 
  also , learning a new languages might open up personality traits you did n't know you had , and might learn you important stuff , like wisdom . 
  that 's what the pvv fears the most , last election they ran partly on `` not having sharia law '', 
  uk people really do n't get the average european do they ? 
  most people from germany and west from there will never see cooperation with russia attainable by 2050 and the uk has proven to be an unstable partner . 
  yeah , but i know other muslim 3rd gen immigrants from countries beside turkey , and they tend to integrate more , the turks romanticize and praise their country and its dictator way out of proportion . 
  i think so , although the turks might say the opposite , as erdogan has riled up turks in our country . 
  most school-days , my school is near a part of the city more inhabited by muslims . 
  i cycle through a few of those districts on my way home . 
  i like how you combined mother and modern , 
  yet charlemagne never learned the language of the paper ( writing ), 
  you have cash over there ? 
  and that 's the german goal, 
  [ ` member good future plans ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ku03p/baltic_coast_of_the_netherlands/ ), 
  king 's day is always fun !, 
  i would like to learn irish someday , or some other celtic language , maybe breton . 
  guess we 'll be up to another 5 years of bullshit, 
  btw , just so you do not get confused , change all vegetables to languages, 
  nah , do n't worry , it will just make it easier for us to - reconquer dutch flanders , including calais - go on holiday to france - get baguettes and if they try to conquer us again , we will just invade them , they will just surrender . 
  we may have few special troops , but ours are some of the best in the world . 
  there is a reason he 's not very relevant anymore , he does n't know how math works with society without taxes , and by that i mean it does n't . 
  - germans know well how to drive real fast - belgians are practically dutch / french ( reminder : make plans to annex belgium ) - luxemburgers have a good flag - british people know english ... 
  it 's the vegetable the geeks made 2500 years ago from their collective varieties so they could ~ ~ understand ~ ~ eat with each other . 
  we have one dumbass who thinks tax is theft , i forgot his name though . 
  also , he 's ( understandably ) but very popular . 
  i think that might send the wrong message , as it 's unheard of and ** seriously inappropriate **, 
  that 's really a hard question , you know they had a ** hard discussion ** about that which lasted just more than 10 years . 
  i believe it wo n't be so easy , part of my belief is that they had a war about ethnicity and also independence just about 9/13 years ago , depends on your opinion . 
  compared to the average garden of a us suburb , a rich would be more useful just because it pays off the exact same , which is nothing , yet does not guzzle such enormous amounts of water, 
  depending on their origin , either the rolling r or the hard g , other than that just learn our grammar , ha !, 
  it 's so dad that on the usa , you have to buy your car from a dealer . 
  sad life, 
  trabants are glorious armoured vehicles without flywheels . 
  no need to apologise , we both learned something here ~ ~ you 're not canadian , you do n't have to apologise for everything ~ ~, 
  oh , we do n't use that here . 
  ns not ss, 
  very lost , but not in a sea of grammar, 
  found the problem : americans are more likely to overgeneralize europe and treat it as a single country . 
  according to pan-askeurope norms , yes !, 
  * desperately truss to die into conversation *, 
  * shamelessly ignores joke * the ns ' network is usually flat on its face . 
  see , you do n't get the joke, 
  do n't go to the netherlands because the ns will not let you travel ns jokes , you have to be dutch to really get them . 
  that must be rundfunk . 
  though , it has only had two seasons yet and me needs moar rundfunk,
