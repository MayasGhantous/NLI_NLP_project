  it 's consistently accurate , like the daily show , and it 's also comedic on almost the same scale, 
  i hoped that , but then why would it be frowned upon ? 
  are amsterveeners really such bad people ? 
  i ca n't imagine such stuff , and i regularly read from r/justnomil, 
  so i 'm assuming that 's a polite yet bs way of calling him a dirty immigrant ? 
  those people exist , this `` expat '' huidarts , was he able expat or was he a huisarts for expats ? 
  do french doctors live in french culture ? 
  at least it 's getting better . 
  this giving out antibiotics to people who cry wolf thing is getting out of hand . 
  this causes bacteria to get more resistant to antibiotics, 
  yeah , portland would be my first choice if i had to move to a city in the usa , it 's just so normal , and i do n't constantly get stuck in grid-lock, 
  but the french do something related to healthcare i do n't approve of . 
  namely giving antibiotics to people who are only a little sick . 
  every person i know who knows french people has told me this . 
  you know that meme that goes  america first , < country  second ? 
  that is from my country 's satirical political comedy show . 
  zondag met lubach ( sunday with lubach ( person ) ), 
  compared to which city ? 
  how am i supposed to know ? 
  do you think i just go around putting women 's pants down ? 
  r/amersfoort , no particular reason / s ( / s only about that last part ), 
  it was n't relevant , but somehow it was his campaign . 
  tap water , as it is a cultural gift . 
  why is this a cultural gift ? 
  because you just have him american beer ** up top !, 
  it is already told that is dutch people already have distinct vocab in our english speech, 
  i did n't really mean to go that deep , i was mostly just listing stereotypes . 
  if i were serious i would have written about braband and it 's culture , but i did n't because , i admit , i am lazy and have a short attention span . 
  no , i am from amersfoort , which the randstad is currently trying to conquer , but our city is just too beautiful . 
  the reason i am not mentioning it is because i barely have contact with them as i am atheist af and also , they tend to keep to their own ( as far as i know ) , and i do n't have time to go to obscure villages without reason . 
  yeah , but that is n't their fault , that is our asshole government 's fault . 
  very good ~ ~ stereotype ~ ~ truth i missed, 
  let 's see : - friesland has an entirely different culture as also language - groningen has commies and one university - the east is either empty or german - limburgish is unintelligible by a long shot, 
  we do n't have one , our prime-minister is bossly single, 
  it might have helped that he mentioned his living in egypt quite often , like , at least once a week, 
  the leader of the pvv is very much held by someone i do not agree with, 
  r/cirkeltrek must love you, 
  i still do n't know all of them , mostly the beginning and the refrain . 
  the spanish must be really mad about this post . 
  here in [ amersfoort ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/amersfoort/ ) , most tourists are old dutch people , i would like more foreigners knowing anything our city . 
  yeah , our politics gets rarely noticed in the current political landscape of the world . 
  you got ta look where is asked about immigrants and/or integration . 
  or you could just take a peek in pvv politics, 
  hmmmmmmmmm, 
  are you on an estonian subreddit ? 
  i forgot this difference : an expat only lives in that country for a few years , an immigrant lives there permanently . 
  we do about mena immigrants , not as much as estonians but still ... 
  an expat almost without exception gets paid much more and works for a foreign company . 
  i 'll be looking into that as i want to learn at least one slavic language in my life . 
  he invited people into his palace on his birthday to celebrate it with them , those people had to also have their birthday on his day and have a special agree then , like 65 , 50 , 16 or something . 
  what the fuck ? 
  our king did n't die !, 
  no , we just like this kind of stuff . 
  our king is also one of the people regularly doing things that shown memes on r/cirkeltrek, 
  yes , though , he is currently working to get a licence for another plane . 
  but that 's not it , before he was king , he was crown prince , and he was spotted drinking a beer , so he was known as prins pils , which i am sure you can translate as you are german . 
  i like our king , he 's one of a kind and mostly symbolic anyways . 
  never heard of it, 
  putin impressed me ... 
  i do n't know what to do anymore, 
  i need to try that, 
  that looks good , what 's it made of ? 
  that , wow . 
  and burek is bosnia ? 
  i ca n't read that , i have yet to learn any slavic language, 
  yes , but that might be the tip of the iceberg , shit , there wo n't be any in the future , help me get a new metaphor for that !, 
  [ link you might find interesting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic_languages?wprov=sfla1 ), 
   almost all dutch people speak english , so it makes sense the languages are similar the opposite reasoning would be more logical . 
  just because many of those people know another language die not make this languages similar , the reason most of us know english is because english has become a necessity in the modern world . 
  yes , but few anglo-saxons learn dutch . 
  overall , dutch and english are about as related to each other as dutch and german , but dutch and german had big influences on each other , so they are more alike . 
  there is one language that is closer to english usually forgotten ( leaving out scots ) , frisian , which seems to be extremely easy to learn for native english speakers , it 's just that only about 425,000 people speak it , and the three dialects are n't mutually intelligible anymore , so technically the is three frisian languages , but i was talking about the dialect spoken in the dutch region of friesland, 
  this is what fuels the stereotype in my brain that americans only get taught american history , but for short , [ ethnic tensions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_wars?wprov=sfla1 ), 
  personally , i see that many are bad at integration , but i believe that is partially caused by parental thoughts of father - / motherland ( i do n't know the difference , please tell me ) . 
  interesting , i should look into that, 
  still , it 's way harder than in the us , have you heard how easy it is to get a gun licence in florida ? 
  and those count for 30 states . 
  i 've certainly seen little of that, 
  really ? 
  am i that young ? 
  also ** few ** , i do not consider 6 years to be a few years , but that is subjective . 
   snow more often snow ** at all ** that we had a few days with snow this year is a miracle , and i hope it wo n't be the last year we have it . 
  kids using english words they do n't know the meaning of randomly placed in dutch sentences . 
  you linked me a flashmob video ? 
  with beethoven ? 
  seriously ? 
  we just had a bell ring and then we had to walk outside in the cold , sometimes during pe . 
  wait , why am i using past tense ? 
  i am still in school, 
  only number one . 
  reasons : - in the netherlands , we only have earthquakes in groningen , where our asshole government fracks up the natural gas , so outside of that area , it 's very rare to find earthquake drills . 
  - we do n't let every joe handle a thing as dangerous as a gun . 
  actually , the teacher , instead of teaching , preferred either fighting with one specific student , or teaching us religious bs , like calling his pencil case jesus , i swear i am not making that up . 
  of course that i can , it 's just the feeling . 
  it feels so cold and dead . 
  no real live picture of it , even after watching so many movies and documentaries . 
  you might want to know i am way younger than that . 
  i know about it , but i ca n't really imagine what it would feel like . 
  actually , i dropped german classes because i had an insane teacher coming in . 
  can i guess that translated , it is something like `` eighth of a kilogramme '',
