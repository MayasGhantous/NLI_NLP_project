   i am afraid the netherlands is also among the countries that probably like to cooperate a lot with america and the uk . 
  no shit ? 
  the [ gchq gets money from the nsa to build up their spy network ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/01/nsa-paid-gchq-spying-edward-snowden ) and the gchq [ helps our intelligence service , the aivd , to find ways to circumvent dutch law ] ( http://rt.com/news/gchq-surveillance-european-agencies-107/ ) so we can have our privacy violated without our knowing . 
  but this is n't about the nsa * or * the aivd . 
  i said the uk barely have a right to be complaining seeing as where their loyalties lie . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure khalid el-masri would disagree with that statement . 
  since it 's quite clear to me where the uk government 's loyalties lie , i can only tell them to cry me a river . 
  i think a lot of this stems from the propaganda your news channels put out ... 
  i mean , it 's not like america has a culture of being shitty people ; from what i 've heard the average american is very kind . 
  it 's just ... money goes from corporations to politicians and from politicians to news channels , who put these crazy ideas in people 's heads . 
  and that 's just sad . 
  good point . 
  i guess you have to start somewhere to change a culture . 
   much of it is cultural and political , with things such as solar panels being lumped in with general liberalism . 
  i think i see where this is going . 
  alternative energy ... global warming ... oh man . 
  [ not really ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qd70a/series_what_do_you_know_about_germany/cdbowqd ) . 
  well , what i mean is that they get counseling and all they have to tell the counselor is that it 's for religious reasons . 
  what then ? 
  handwave their religion ? 
  i 'd say `` yes '' , please do , but i doubt the religious forces within the population would just let it go . 
   among others counselling . 
  and then what ? 
  they 'll just play the religion card . 
  why is there a taboo on solar panels ? 
  [ not helping yourself ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1py4ke/results_of_international_english_proficiency_test/cd7cdbk ) :-p, 
  the comment section looks very sad and empty , but it deserves to be said : that is some funny shit , right there . 
  how does that even happen ? 
  ssh , i 'm saving you from downvote hell for disrespecting the war . 
  yeah , football player from the seventies . 
  i just `` conveniently '' ignored the second part ( yes , the punchline ) of your comment to make a more ... useful point . 
  the best part of all this is that - get this - germans are humans like you and me . 
  i ca n't help but wonder what i would do if i was in their shoes in that era . 
  would i be silent ? 
  would i get dragged along in the frenzy ? 
  i doubt i 'd have the stones to stand up . 
  hate for germans is illogical and destructive - fear for the darker side of humanity is not . 
  merely making oneself understandable is not a top tier skill . 
  and neither is the level of reading and writing i see people do . 
  fraught with grammatical mistakes , sentences that make no sense whatsoever , etc. 
  people here just do n't seem to get any practice , that 's the whole problem . 
  because when i listen to people around me attempting to speak english , it 's extremely awkward . 
  embarrassing even , at times . 
  i 've been in english classes where the teacher barely managed to complete a decent sentence . 
  i know hitler was austrian , and i vaguely recall the term `` anschluss '' , but was austria such a huge deal ? 
  i 'm not exactly a ww2 aficionado , mind you ... 
  but ... but ... `` do n't mention the war '' is [ le ] epic maymay that * has * to be brought up every time the conversation involves germany !, 
  it 's totally funny every single time and i have * no clue * why you it would drive you nuts !, 
  i was going to say that if the netherlands is third on the list , i fear for europe . 
  i 'm glad to see the efi is not that accurate , though . 
  nah , the pedoscare in the uk ( and elsewhere ) is getting out of hand . 
  [ brasseye did a special on it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcu7faeeznu ) . 
   you just expressed the idea of `` in a literal sense '' perfectly fine , using 4 words . 
  except i still used the word `` literal '' . 
  that 's like changing the meaning of the word `` archaeologist '' to mean someone who is building houses but keeping the word `` archaeology '' to mean a study of the past/ancient times ( and that is a generous comparison on my part as an archaeologist and house-building is not the exact opposite ) . 
  so no , i did n't . 
   dutch has no single word for the english word `` awkward , '' odd , i can think of one right from top of my head . 
   if a critical mass of english speakers adopt the usage ah yes , that vague , undefined critical mass again . 
   who says `` literally '' does n't mean `` figuratively ? '', 
  the status quo . 
  you are advocating change . 
  i do n't need to advocate a damn thing . 
  allright , you keep sowing confusion through misleading language by using words that mean the exact opposite , effectively impoverishing the english language by robbing it from the ability to express `` in a literal sense '' , all the while defending it by appealing to a vague , undefined popularity . 
  then i 'll correctly keep using the word `` literally '' when i mean `` literally '' until there is a different way to express it , because i kinda like communication . 
  popularity does not make something more valid . 
  the misuse is merely widespread . 
  your logic is flawed . 
  if a statement has a misleading construct , it has a misleading construct , irrespective of how many or few people fall for it . 
  the word `` literally '' is meant to signify that you should stop and remember that this phrase is not meant figuratively . 
  that some cases would then create absurdity is completely irrelevant . 
  so once more , unless there is an alternative word for `` in a literal sense '' , using literally to mean `` not literally '' is plain misuse . 
  poor comparison : homosexual and happy are not opposites . 
  as long as there is no alternate word that can be used to describe `` in a literal sense '' , using `` literally '' to mean the exact opposite is extremely misleading ... or just sloppy . 
   it 's that your government has outsourced part of the process of spying on you to the us and uk and as payment gchq and the nsa get access to the data . 
  yes , as i said , how big of a bitch they are . 
   anway , yes , de telegraaf had an article on aivd using prism data on dutch citizens in june . 
  there 's more to come still , apparently . 
  i 'm still waiting with baited breath to see big of a bitch our government has been for the nsa . 
  small victories are victories too . 
  i 'll take it . 
  well , more like you earn a good salary , education is pretty much paid for you , generally a high standard of well-being , people that are generally kind and open and try to make you as a foreigner feel welcome . 
  things like that . 
  i 've been hearing great things about denmark . 
  goddammit , why is david cameron such a huge fucking douche ? 
  can that man do anything right ? 
  sweden . 
  scandinavia is getting pretty crowded , looking at the comments here . 
   google allows you to modify chrome source code and redistribute the result under an open-source license , but only if you call it something other than chrome , which is google 's registered trademark . 
  that 's why debian calls the resulting browser chromium . 
  debian has nothing to do with chromium in this respect . 
  google made chrome and decided to release the source code as chromium . 
  from that moment on they continued building on chromium . 
  this is why , when you download the google chrome source code , you get forwarded to the chromium website . 
  as the chromium wiki puts it : `` google chrome is the chromium open source project built , packaged , and distributed by google . '', 
  so no , i do n't see the similarity . 
   wikipedia has a good writeup of the events alright : `` the debian free software guidelines are used by the debian project to determine whether a license is a free license , which in turn is used to determine whether something can be included in debian . 
  as the logo did not meet these requirements , it could not be used by software which was to be included in debian . 
  this effect of the mozilla trademark policy led to a long debate within the debian project in 2004 and 2005 . 
  during this debate , the name `` iceweasel '' was coined to refer to rebranded versions of firefox . '', 
  that was what i was referring to .
