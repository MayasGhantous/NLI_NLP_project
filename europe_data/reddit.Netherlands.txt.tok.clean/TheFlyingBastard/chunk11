  i do n't see how . 
  the debian wiki [ states ] ( https://wiki.debian.org/iceweasel ) that `` iceweasel is a fork from firefox '' . 
  apparently debian did n't quite like the way how mozilla handled the firefox trademark ( it was n't open enough ) and since mozilla did n't like the way debian handled it either , they made their own fork . 
  that 's no way to behave when someone is correcting an inaccuracy . 
  rather , he should be thanked for dispelling a flaw in someone 's understanding : everyone gains , nobody loses . 
  well , chromium is . 
  google tweaks chromium a bit and releases it as chrome . 
  stop ruining my dreams !, 
  politicians do n't control what browsers we use , though . 
  apparently [ young people do n't know how to use a computer either ] ( http://coding2learn.org/blog/2013/07/29/kids-cant-use-computers/ ) . 
  germany cares about its privacy again , i see . 
  you go , guys . 
  i hope they tightened the seats back up afterwards . 
  that 's kinda what makes it even funnier . 
  wonderful idea . 
  they usually go for that whole `` freedom '' thing . 
  remember `` freedom fries '' ? 
  `` leave us your personal details to be able to sign this online petition !, 
  save your privacy ! '', 
  yeah , no . 
  that immediately turned me off . 
  i do n't need to leave my name and address with these people . 
  you mean they 're what snickers are to mars , inc. ? 
  fanta to the coca cola company ? 
  somehow i feel hungry now . 
  though perhaps not necessarily aivd , i for one am excited about the next batch of revelations from the snowden files . 
  apparently we '' [ have no idea ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2013/10/dutch_have_no_idea_about_scale.php ) '' . 
  my curiosity is almost * killing * me !, 
  i see , thanks for the feedback . 
  i 'll be more clear about my intentions in the future . 
  the question remains ... what made you think i was defending this russian character at all ? 
  please tell me so i can communicate my points better in the future . 
  ... yeah , you 've got a good point there . 
  of course it 's curiosity . 
  what use is it for me to stay deliberately ignorant ? 
  and staying deliberately ignorant by asking a question , is n't that a bit silly ? 
  i mean ... what part made you think i was anything but curious ? 
  apparently we got some wires crossed here . 
   you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to sense that this show by the dutch has partly to do with the dutch vessel stuck somewhere in russian port . 
  funny guy you are , thinking that the dutch government would even think of deliberately pissing off russia . 
  second , you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to spout conjecture - and that 's exactly what you 're doing . 
  you 're not sensing a damn thing . 
   first , the dutch allegedly beaten the politician . 
  diplomat . 
  not politician . 
   second , they could have taken the children away from him without arresting him ( if you were so concerned about his children ) . 
  justice requires the wrongdoer , being the catalyst , to be isolated from its victims , not to take a bunch of victims away and let the wrongdoer walk free . 
   ( and please , do provide arguments if you intend to downvote . ), 
  done . 
  here 's your downvote , because your comment seems to have been so ill-thought through it contributed nothing valuable to any discussion . 
  i see , thanks . 
  so from the comments here i gather that he was arrested for abusing his children or something ... the neighbours called the police and the story goes that the police came and were a bit rough with him ? 
  i have no clue what parts of this story is true . 
  are there parts of this whole affair that are supported by reliable information ? 
  charming fellow you are . 
  i 'm asking what happened to that russian diplomat as i have n't exactly followed that story . 
  i was n't asking for your verbal abuse or attempts to put words in my mouth . 
   gtfo !, 
  take your own advice . 
  whatever happened to that russian diplomat who was , if i recall the story correctly , beaten with police batons and dragged to a police station ? 
  because that 's sure what this reminds me of . 
   going by my education the only thing that happened in germany in wwii was that the people that lived at that time commited a genocide on the jewish people and that the allied forces stopped that . 
  how is this packaged , culturally ? 
  is it told as an objective fact , with some distance as it is in the past ? 
  or is it treated with a lot of embarassment ? 
  i guess what i 'm asking is , with what kind of emotion is ww2 taught in german history classes ? 
  i would 've never expected the netherlands to treat their elderly so well . 
  after all , [ apparently the elderly here have `` do n't euthanize me '' bracelets , otherwise they 'll just be killed ] ( http://www.factcheck.org/2012/02/santorums-bogus-euthanasia-claims/ ) . 
  `` even when the monkey wears a golden ring , it will always be an ugly thing . '', 
  the monkey that is . 
  in dutch we say : `` geen slapende honden wakker maken '' ( ` do n't wake any sleeping dogs ' ) , which means not to start trouble . 
  i think it 's the same in english , actually . 
  restarting an old argument is only one way of not letting sleeping dogs lie . 
   dutch : schijt recht omhoog i have never heard this one . 
  i that something uniquely flemish ? 
  gods , i love flemish . 
  so how does this help improve internet connection speed and ensure isps uphold their promises ? 
  yeah , * someone * has n't done their research on their subject . 
  i mean , i understand you want to look cool by naming the capital city of a country , but man , does it ever backfire if that city has nothing to do with politics . 
  if it helps , it was named after joost van den vondel , a 17th century playwright . 
  he used to be on the five guilder bill way back when we did n't have euros yet . 
  see , now you have another bit of trivia to tell your friends * and * you have a good excuse to practice the name . 
  germany will come back though , like it has battered-spouse syndrome . 
  hence my inclusion of the word `` the '' in the translation . 
  and since the 's means `` des '' , which is not used anymore , it 's fancy and historical . 
  and thus we have come full circle . 
  what ? 
  that 's some crazy shit . 
  what the hell happened there ? 
  i just find it amusing that of all the countries to pick as a football rival , germany did n't pick england or even france . 
  they took the innocent little country right next to them . 
  i 'm surprised you , being german , did n't say anything about football , to be honest . 
   they have funny place names like 's - hertogenbosch and though it has that fancy historical '' 's '' at the start , all the name means is `` the duke 's forest '' . 
  how 's that for silly ? 
   the language sounds like retarded german . 
  i always like to say we sound like dejected germans . 
   yeah , the stories are all quite true  `` the stories '' . 
  apparently the wind in this country is stuff of legend ? 
  it does n't seem that bad to me ... 
   known in english as dairy of a young girl psst , `` diary '' .
