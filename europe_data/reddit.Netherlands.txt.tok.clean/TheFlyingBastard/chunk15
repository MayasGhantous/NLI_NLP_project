  question , why are we now outraged at germany and seem to have forgotten all about the main evildoer in this whole scheme : the us ? 
  belgium , especially flanders , has been exposing their heels to us for a while now . 
  and now those german thighs !, 
  i say , conversing about this subject has given me the vapours !, 
  then do n't settle for trading a painful death for a good life . 
  demand both . 
  again , it 's not an either/or proposition . 
  we have vaalserberg ( mount vaals ) , which technically is n't even a mountain . 
  it 's twice as high as himmelbjerget , though , so i think you 've got us beat nicely there . 
  ... are you trying to knock over a strawman ? 
  indeed . 
  but it 's not an either/or proposition . 
  the way an animal has lived has no bearing on the discussion on how to slaughter it . 
  hence my saying that forbidding factory farming to make up for this form of halal slaughter looks more assuaging consciences . 
  `` well , the slaughters might be unethical , but at least they had good lives , right ? '', 
  i wrote `` method of death '' , not `` death '' . 
  that sounds like a way to assuage consciences by `` making up for it '' rather than tackling the actual problem ; the method of death . 
  with well-built cars and the autobahn ? 
  solar panels on the concept art . 
  should at least account for some of it . 
  i am partial to words like * hobbezak * , which are clothes that are way too large for the wearer/someone pudgy and unattractive and * kruk * , which is a crutch/someone clumsy . 
  honourable mentions : - droplul ( licorice dick , [ funnily enough also made into an actual confection ] ( http://www.feestreus.nl/picture/artikelen/1628.jpg ) ) - kut ( cunt , classic offensive word , but mentioned because it 's especially nice to call men cunts . ), 
  - graf ~ ( grave ~ . 
  shove any word after it . 
  - gluiperd ( from an old word meaning ` to look through slits ' . 
  used for slick , sneaky and untrustworthy people . ), 
  ... wow , that was the poorest comparison i 've seen this week . 
  he explained how it undermines public support for benefits and that that is what ruins the welfare state . 
  he makes a good point ... but your comment makes it seem you had already passed judgment before he even answered . 
  i was going to say , which sietch did he get thrown out of then ? 
  i know , man . 
  i really do feel sorry for all of you . 
  little secret : i actually was a member last elections . 
  right now they 're up against brein , the dutch copyright watchdog . 
  the pirate party had linked on their website to the pirate bay , you see . 
  brein then started an ex parte case against them for linking to illegal content , which brein won ( obviously , that 's ex parte for you ) . 
  the pirate party then linked to sites where the pirate bay was mentioned with links to proxies . 
  now they 're in court again , but they get to defend themselves this time . 
  right now , though , people in this country care so little about these issues that we need a greater awareness of tpp and what it stands for in general . 
  right now they 're our key to having a say . 
  what makes you say that ? 
  no kidding . 
  i often comfort myself with thought that we 're not this big country with hundreds of millions of people who can only realistically choose between two parties : right-wing and extreme right-wing . 
  no , he really is n't . 
  he 's like nigel farage , but with less substance . 
  it 's kind of difficult to pick between bumbling idiots and professional politicians . 
  [ pirate party ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hmyhl/six_icelandic_mps_have_proposed_a_bill_that_would/cavv5ts ) next elections ? 
   the six mps are the three members of the pirate party pirate party made parliament in iceland ? 
  i bet they ordered 2 ^ 6 seats , but decided that you needed an odd number to prevent a tie in voting so they tossed one seat out the window . 
  6:00 - 12:00 = morning 12:00 - 18:00 = afternoon 18:00 - 0:00 = evening 0:00 - 6:00 = night though times during late nights such as 5:00 are also often called `` mornings '' . 
  dae obama is [ le ] terally hitler ? 
  i was so relieved when i saw the name `` emily '' popping up rather than `` bill '' . 
  do n't give me a heart attack , op . 
  i for one would welcome our flemish little bros. . lovely people . 
  nah , it 's not like * politicians * are raging against surveillance ( with a few exceptions ) . 
  it 's the citizens , mostly . 
   they are pretty clearly on us ' side here . 
  with friends like these ... 
  well of course not everyone . 
  that 's hyperbole for you . 
  well , there goes my childhood . 
  that was some blatant tu quoque , really . 
  our own governments spying on us is bad enough , other governments even moreso . 
  the most powerful , polarized and commercial country in the first world pulling this shit makes me slightly nervous . 
   it would probably make up for the pedophile reputation our country has though . 
  what ? 
  pedophile reputation ? 
  really ? 
  but ... but you have studio 100 !, 
  unless that is of course all part of the plan ... plopperdeplop !, 
  snowden asked everyone in europe for asylum , not just germany . 
  [ also see this submission ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hhic9/snowden_has_applied_for_asylum_in_21_countries/ ) . 
  edit : oh , i see that 's what it says in the article . 
  now which european country will take snowden in rather than taking it between the buttocks from the us ? 
  i 'm not holding my breath for dutch politicians to be so brave . 
  i had been trying to think of a word than would fit and the most common verb totally slipped my mind . 
  they had what ? 
  to bee , we have beed ? 
  i must be missing something ... 
  welcome to the hotel california . 
  it appears you do n't have that . 
  primary education lasts until around the age of 12 , secondary starts at that age - new school and such . 
  both are rolled up into folkeskole in denmark , right ? 
  actually , yes . 
  the underwear bomber was caught on the flight from amsterdam to detroit . 
  ironically , it was also a dutchman , jasper schuringa , that stopped him . 
  i think they 're spying on the wrong people . 
  first reaction is to say : `` oh , it 's not so bad . '', 
  that is one way . 
  i voted pirate party ( did n't even get a seat : - / ) and donate to bits of freedom . 
  i guess that 's something . 
  quite concerned about this shit . 
  that 's the worst part of it too . 
  when i say that our phones get tapped more than in the us , the first reaction i get is : `` a larger percentage , you mean . '', 
  not a larger percentage . 
  total . ', 
  and then they turn around and stop caring . 
  stop ruining it for me !, 
  i want to believe . 
  not exactly .
