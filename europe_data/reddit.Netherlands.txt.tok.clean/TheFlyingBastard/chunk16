  i mean , might as well say that it was copied from [ the coat of arms of our royal family ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/nassau_wapen.svg/150px-nassau_wapen.svg.png ) . 
  it differs just as much . 
  it 's a pretty generic symbol , after all . 
  `` i 'm already buying an xbox one . '', 
  i usually ask them if they have any illnesses , with whom they have shared their beds and pictures of their genitalia . 
  it 's just a lion rampant ... 
  extremely common in heraldry because it stands for royalty and strength . 
  wonderful . 
  glad the germans are at least standing up . 
  i 'm sick and tired of the general ignorance about privacy issues that exists in my country . 
  `` if you have nothing to hide ... '' every single time . 
  thanks , obama . 
  `` culture '' is not an excuse for harming others . 
  `` treason '' . 
  they 're looking more and more like the people they fled from centuries ago every day . 
  would they have the man hung , drawn and quartered next ? 
  the dutch houses ( lower house/house of representatives/house of commons and the upper house/senate/house of lords ) are called respectively the first and second chamber in the netherlands . 
  i think he meant something along the lines of ` politicians will never be using the internet to vote . ', 
   our tiny little country ( in wester europe , very pro-us ) i did n't know we were `` very pro-us '' . 
  in fact , the general sentiment towards the us seems to be `` shit is crazy over there '' as far as i have seen . 
   a pay-per-mile car tax system pay-per-kilometer . 
  we use the metric system here . 
   our dutch passport contains both fingerprints , facial recognition and rifd . 
  new passports will not have fingerprints in a few months . 
  do n't know about the other two . 
   does it matter ? 
  in this case , yes . 
  this is n't about the amount of sheep per square meter . 
  the netherlands has been known as this gay paradise with canal parades and whatnot for some time . 
  plus we were the first to have gay marriage . 
  that reputation and history makes the netherlands an interesting country to include in such a study . 
  tell me about it . 
  i worked at an isp owned by kpn . 
  you have no idea how terrible communication and cooperation is . 
  they just do n't give a shit . 
  how interesting . 
  a change of mind ... or perhaps not having to toe the party line any longer ? 
  perhaps she got informed . 
  not entirely surprising , i guess . 
  this is where kroes comes from . 
   ikea ikea is ours now , actually . 
  nah , i really do n't care about football . 
  unless it 's orange playing in a big tournament . 
  fighting for the spanish . 
  yeah , but for what c. . . ooooh . 
  i see . 
  edl and bnp ( and possibly ukip ) will have a * field day * with this . 
  these men do not know what they have unleashed . 
  i 'd rather they bring back games without frontiers and use * that * for our eurobonding experience . 
  looking at how the scores are allocated , it 's all thanks to acknowledging gender identity in the law . 
  apparently that is weighed six times as heavy as actually having equal marriage . 
  because apparently we are a risk group . 
  homosexuals are overrepresented among the people who are found to have contracted hiv . 
  you know , just like how men are not allowed to work with children because men are overrepresented among child molesters . 
  wait ... 
  oh , you 're right . 
  when i posted that comment i was looking on a screen with a slightly blueish tint . 
  yay , land of ~ ~ tolerance ~ ~ no data !, 
  shit . ~ ~, 
  but you can not make deals with the tax agency directly on how much you pay directly . 
  the article neglects to mention that . 
  what you * can * negotiate is how much * profit * you will be making . 
  if a company makes more profit than it agreed to make , the agreement is broken and thus apa gets reevaluated , because the provided numbers were simply wrong . 
  at least , on paper . 
  in practice , companies get away with this . 
  by the end of next month there should be ideas on the table on how to stop this . 
  yeah , you 're making things appear slightly different than they really are . 
  when a company settles in the netherlands ( officially ) , they can go to the tax office , and fill in the appropriate paperwork . 
  they have to tell the tax agency certain things , like how much profit they expect to make . 
  depending on how much profit these companies put in their shell , they get taxed . 
  once this company was found out to be making a lot more profit ( thanks to some outside intervention ) , the deal was off , and they were taxed more than the initial agreement . 
  this is laziness and bureaucratic ineptitude , not an attempt to `` screw with other european countries '' . 
  the fact that this happens is known and it is being worked on . 
  you 're implying quite a lot about intent here . 
  might want to watch out with that . 
  are you implying anyone said that the dutch screwing others over in the past was fair ? 
  because i must 've missed that part of the discussion . 
  `` click `` like '' if you want to defend true marriage . '', 
  upvote for you because you contributed to the discussion , regardless of anyone 's personal opinion . 
  i 'd like to point others to reddiquette : do n't downvote because you disagree . 
  op asked for opinions ; mongol_winter gave his . 
  for that reason he should not be downvoted . 
  since you do n't understand dutch , let me translate the song for you . 
  obviously some things will be lost in translation , but i 'll try and keep the errors intact , eg . 
  mixing up the present and future forms within a sentence ( `` i 'll be your beacon in the night , i 'm pointing you to the harbour in the darkness '' ) -- * singing * there you are you have seen this moment in your dreams so often there it is that day that you knew which would come is finally here are you ready ? 
  can you ever really be ? 
  there you are everyone has a task in this life done everything to prepare and there it is you promise you will give it your all every step you took led to this point and look around you we 're walking along * chorus 1 : * through the rain and the wind i will keep standing next to you i will protect you against everything that comes i shall stay awake when you 're asleep i will keep you from the storm i will keep you safe as long as i 'm alive * rap : * one battle , two lives we stand for one another , unbreakable one flag , two lions together in the sun and the rain side by side , chest out proud as a peacock , this is our sound and however small we may be our acts are great are not going to fail for you , my child for my dad for my mom walk for you through the wind and rain and will stand behind you i carry a banner with your name believe in you as long as we exist i build a dyke with my bare hands and keep the water away from you * chorus 2 : * let me know what you dream what your heart so yearns for i shall not rest until it has become truth and if you ever lose your way i 'll be your beacon in the night i 'm pointing you to the harbour in the darkness i will fight like a lion until you have nothing more to want i 'm keeping you safe as long as i 'm alive * noise and cultist chanting : * the w of william three fingers in the air , come on the w of william three fingers in the air , come on , come on the w of william is the w of we all of orange stands side by side the w of water which we do not avoid we drain [ lit . 
  make it dry ] it and we build dykes the w of welcome in our midst whichever god you pray to the w of william the w of william the w of waking , eating [ stamppot ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stamppot ) millions of coaches who know better the w of always wanting to win whatever it is we start * chorus 1 * * chorus 2 * i 'm keeping you safe as long as i 'm alive, 
  i wish it was n't so . 
  it does n't fit with anyone except the very people who circlejerk over this : the mediawhores of our country . 
  they could 've chosen a * fun * song . 
  one that people would actually appreciate . 
  [ je bent een koning ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s46pt8ueafg ) or something . 
  i wonder if there are plans to sing * that * song somewhere . 
  or have everyone agree that that is now the official song and fuck this `` national committee '' . 
  noooooooo !, 
  40 % did n't like the song . 
  60 % did . 
  and that 's what they want to use ? 
  edit : oh , looks like 1vandaag also did a poll : 82 % hated the song .
