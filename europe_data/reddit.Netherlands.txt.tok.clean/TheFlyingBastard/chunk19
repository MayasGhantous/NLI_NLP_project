   so far , only dutch mobile operator kpn has made a four-digit order of the fairtrade smartphone , kpn ? 
  dammit . 
  looks like i wo n't be getting that anytime soon under a contract . 
  maybe i can buy it off contract . 
  if it 's a good phone , of course . 
  now add how much money is going around in the footballing industry in each country . 
  practicality . 
  the new king can be shown the ropes by his mother . 
  you 've experienced four generations of queens ? 
  * anyone ? 
  ... no one ? 
  ... making a right fool of myself , eh ? 
  * chuckles * finally something at which we excel . 
  their values concerning homosexuals are immoral and only for that reason they should not keep them . 
  what is this , the 19th century ? 
  human well-being must trump cultural legacy every time . 
  dude ... football was practically * invented * in england . 
  you want to take away our national favourite sport because it 's a commonwealth game ? 
  `` drained '' ? 
  we had to build a freaking island in the middle of it to get some landmass in there . 
  ahaha , oh god , scandinavia is like a limp dong dangling off europe 's head . 
  snow , ice and trains that either do n't run on time or fall apart . 
  we had a similar situation in our country with the pvv , which really is the dutch version of ukip . 
  geert wilders ' party was part of the hung parliament because they needed those few seats for a house majority . 
  i think it 's a reflects on the voters , because there are plenty of good parties to vote for . 
  cycling is what gives us lovely buttocks . 
  the final designs for our dutch guilders were actually quite beautiful , i think . 
  [ 10 guilders ] ( http://www.catawiki.nl/catalogus/bankbiljetten/series/periodieke-kunst-nederland/159277-10-gulden-nederland-1997?area=2a12c5654104548fac07e1fbd1df78550d693c30 ) - that black clover shape on the right is actually reflective . 
  watermarked with a kingfisher . 
  also had a poem in fine print on the back .

  you can probably imagine the disappointment when i saw the euro bills . 
  for something so ubiquitous and important in everyone 's life , i do n't think good looking bills is merely a matter of vanity . 
  indeed . 
  a true english gentleman does not just call others names in the public square . 
  all proper forms , slapping one another with silk gloves included , must be obeyed . 
  jes , its not laik its a lenkwedsj wif ferrie kompliekeetet pronansieesjun roels . 
  those accents . 
  i 'm terribly embarassed about the last one . 
  i 'm so sorry you people had to listen to that . 
  when i read a danish wikipedia page , i can kind of make out what the words mean , even though i do n't know one iota of danish ( is it proper to use ` iota ' , a greek letter , when talking about a different language ? 
  ) , but when a dane reads it to me i ca n't follow it along at all . 
  it 's like you have all decided to play a cruel trick on the world . 
  ` huehue , let 's say something that does n't look like the words on the page at all . 
  some confusing yet dancing sounds come out , and then , when we turn around , you start speaking a very stylish mix of dutch and german . 
  mammals need to apologize for exploiting that impact event . 
   to prevent tory losses to ukip . 
  oh god what ? 
  ukip is actually still taken seriously ? 
  i mean , it 's not the bnp , but ... 
  fits so well with the second verse of your commonwealth anthem : `` o lord our god arise , scatter her enemies , and make them fall : confound their politics , frustrate their knavish tricks , on thee our hopes we fix : god save us all . '', 
  something tells me some of you guys really do n't like the mainland . 
  it was n't until the crisis that we started associating greece with anything negative . 
  your reputation was always that of beautiful weather , great food , amazing history and generally a place as close to paradise as can be . 
   austria - mozart was german , hitler austrian . 
   `` hitler was not ours . 
  we had mozart , though . '', 
  beautiful . 
  i think your ~ ~ president ~ ~ ex-pm does n't help your reputation either ... 
  you know what the whole irony is about viewing the dutch as drunken/stoned ? 
  it 's actually the english tourists that are the biggest drinkers/smokers/customers of prostitutes in this country . 
  also , leaky dykes [ is just hilarious ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jun/05/flooding-us-defence ) . 
  you guys have an excellent sense of humour at least . 
  i 'm a bit ashamed , really . 
  you guys are our euro-bros , but nobody knows this . 
  our people are quite similar . 
  we do n't even have an actual stereotype for you guys , i think . 
   also , what 's up with pronouncing zeven as zeuven ? 
  it 's just plain silly . 
  i know , right ? 
  you do n't say `` neugen '' , so why say `` zeuven '' ? 
   foul their windmills with our bowels  and vomit into their canals `` bowels '' and `` canals '' do not rhyme . 
   netherlands : racists . 
  actual laughter was produced . 
  whaaaaat ? 
  how did that come about ? 
  well , that 's not very diplomatic . 
  not disliking . 
  just not liking them as much as the flemish . 
  the flemish are our euro-bros . 
  kids grow up on your shows . 
  so did i. 
  think samson & gert . 
  also , you speak a much nicer version of the same language and consistently win at language games . 
  over here they 're vlaamse frieten . 
  we do n't quite like the walloons as much as we like the flemish . 
  when we think belgium , we usually think of the flemish . 
  you can call us '' ollanders ' . 
  you 're still our silly little brother that we love so much , with your vlaamse frieten and studio 100 . 
   confused by all the crisis summits ? 
  this might help : not really . 
  this actually kinda confused me , to be honest . 
  it looks a bit messy , despite the neat outline . 
  it 's a wall of information and graphics and i do n't even understand what half of these words mean . 
  `` boosted transparency and capital levels '' ? 
  `` hedgefunds '' ?
