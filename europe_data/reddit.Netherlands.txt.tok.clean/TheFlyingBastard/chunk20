  `` renumeration practices '' ? 
  it must be because i 'm totally ignorant of all this banking business , because i feel like this infographic requires an infographic of its own to explain the explanations . 
  hey hey , mind the lip . 
  otherwise we 'll have to get our players to karate kick every single member of der mannschaft in their ribs . 
  you know they can do it ; ask the spanish . 
  not if we can help it , dammit !, 
  nah , i 'm not criticizing sweden . 
  it 's just that reddit in general seems to love sweden a little bit too much , so if something breaks up that image of it being a paradise , i ca n't help but be slightly amused . 
  where is your sweden now , reddit ? 
  right , because this shit is n't all over the news right now and neither is that `` scum village '' thing in amsterdam . 
  seriously , gtfo . 
  native dutch people are not outlawed . 
   ironically , the shooter also wore blue & yellow he wore the colours of the swedish flag ? 
  so tell me , adjustablefit , where were you when this happened ? 
  the swinging hitlers sounds like something i 'd actually watch eurovision for . 
  i just did a google image search . 
  that is beautiful . 
  looks like a place where i could spend a weekend . 
  i heard warschau is gorgeous too . 
  never been there myself , but apparently it 's pretty good . 
  \u00c9ire confirmed for most badass names . 
  bakers , shoemakers and millers ? 
  pfah . 
   [ ghoughpteighbteau tchoghs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potato_chip ), 
  you 're right . 
  he probably does n't even speak french . 
  so , kind of like `` barbarians '' ? 
  big brother germany has been a bit abusive in the past , but you have to appreciate how effective they are in their work . 
  i think we of all people can appreciate that . 
   `` get rich or die when trying '' is n't that the * american * dream ? 
  the day that you knew who would come ... 
  it 's like a timeshare , except with an island instead of a chalet . 
  this is why everyone goes south of the rivers to have fun . 
  sung by the producer 's four children , eh ? 
  `` kraaienpoten '' are that thing people get at the corners of their eyes when they are aging . 
  an obsessed fan , named after eminem 's * stan * . 
  man , we should totally reclaim parts of the north sea and make you part of the continent . 
  if we do n't have enough land , we 'll just steal some from the sea . 
  why the fuck not , right ? 
   i do n't have a weird name for `` the europeans outside of holland '' . 
  dupes . 
  likely it meant something like : `` those guys who get * really * pissed off when they see an enemy . '', 
  now that you mention it , i know that there 's something like mars chocolate milk or something . 
  saw it in my local store a few months ago . 
  must not have caught on , as i have n't seen it in a while . 
  but thanks to stephen colbert and eminem , we also have `` truthiness '' and `` stan '' . 
  yeah , i know it was , sorry if i gave you the impression i 'm blaming you for anything . 
  it was a shitty article . 
  just giving you a heads up . 
   i read somewere here on reddit that of the arrests made in the demonstrations , none were greek nationals . 
  this is not true . 
  there were ( from the top of my head ) something like 25 arrests . 
  15 of those were not greek nationals . 
  i used to be a jehovah 's witness , and we had a bible study once with a guy and his ( illiterate ) son in a trailer park . 
  the man was kinda flaky , and we had the impression that he was just stringing us along for some reason . 
  probably just wanted to have company without talking about all the bible crap . 
  anyway , he got into quite a few altercations with his family who did not like us visiting him . 
  actually started wrecking his shit when he would continue talking to us , that 's how badly they wanted us gone . 
  they were probably right for the wrong reasons . 
  i 've never had any problems with roma myself , though . 
   praises the spanish king it is n't so much praising as subtly elbowing him in the ribs . 
  `` i 've honoured him always . 
  but i 'm my own man now , bitch . '', 
   like targeting an armenian because of his looks wait ... what ? 
  what did people think you looked like ? 
   censorship should be used modestly . 
  people are bandying the word ` censorship ' around a lot lately to the point where it is losing meaning . 
  they * could * downvote posts they consider off-topic . 
  but they do n't . 
   mod 's job is to prevent illegal posts , doxxing , spamming etc. 
  ... and off-topic content . 
  reddit is not a special exception . 
  one could even say it was [ quite spunky ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/376kg6/nude_sona_to_celebrate_no_mod_week/crk4mvq ) . 
  and the [ truly fantastic content ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/376kg6/nude_sona_to_celebrate_no_mod_week/crk439m ) it led to !, 
  the [ admins really appreciated it too ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/37ma1v/transparency_second_admin_clarification_of_the/#admins ) . 
  and what a victim he would be . 
   change after change , almost all of them are massively downvoted by our community . 
  that happens a lot , not just on / r/europe , so it might just be that people are resistant to change . 
  all in all , / r/europe is a pretty damn high quality subreddit . 
  the hell is your problem ? 
  are people not allowed to make mistakes ? 
   and are n't we old enough to know whether or not we want to discuss a particular topic ? 
  people post off-topic content a lot . 
  a forum moderator 's job is to keep the place clean and on-topic . 
  huh , that 's interesting . 
  never heard of the nederlandse maagd . 
  thanks . 
  you 're right : black people are not fit to help others . 
  wait , that does n't sound right ... 
  yeah , ethics be damned !, 
  `` nederland '' is a neuter word in dutch . 
  you 'll find dutch people will probably start laughing , but that 's mostly admiration . 
  it 's really nice to hear people make an effort , no matter how poor it sounds . 
  it signals respect . 
  honestly , i just cheered for my fellow germanics , not quite europe , because if they beat brazil , they could finish off those argentinians who `` won '' against orange by not playing football and parking the bus instead . 
  others and myself were just cheering for vengeance , really . 
   ryder cup that 's golf though . 
  i honestly ca n't get excited enough about that to make it a subject of conversation . 
  to me golf is a good excuse to walk outside in the sun and enjoy a well-kept park and the company of a friend and nothing more . 
   we have won another world cup football !,
