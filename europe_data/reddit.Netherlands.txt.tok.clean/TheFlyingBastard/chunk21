  hurray yurp !, 
  : europe :, 
  okay , i guess ... ? 
  i honestly ca n't think of any context in which i would use an emoji of the eu flag unironically . 
  i care exactly dick . 
  i said you were wrong just because you 're shitposting , no other reason . 
  in fact , it 's submissions such as these that make me stop caring in the first place . 
  i have n't insulted you . 
  additionally , considering the way you started this submission , i find it extremely ironic you should say that . 
  just because you 're shitposting , i 'm going to say that yes , you are wrong . 
  loaded language , finger pointing , modbashing . 
  shitpost confirmed . 
  and even then , even if it * was * the guy 's fault , shouting `` the bastard shall burn '' is not conductive in any way , shape or form . 
  psychopathic bloodlust does n't help . 
  i miss the designs though . 
  guilders had fantastic designs , both the coins * and * the notes . 
  around quebecs , never relax . 
  we 'll just mint 2.50 s. '', 
  i love the belgians . 
  yeah , but then we do n't have a * gay * pride , we have a * non-vanilla * pride . 
  i wonder how the attitude among the officers is . 
  are there homophobes among them ? 
  what does the police force do about them ? 
  can those individuals compartmentalize it ? 
  they 're humans , after all . 
  right ? 
  i mean , what are they so butthurt about ? 
  wait , let me rephrase that . 
   so you 're completely incapable of inferring context as well ? 
  ... no , that part of the discussion was about a definition of course i understood that . 
  i 'm saying the dictionary has no value here , though . 
  after all , it only describes definitions as people commonly use them . 
  not only is it not prescriptive , it does n't address the philosophical context behind it . 
  after all , i did n't ask : `` could you give me a definition of ` natural ' ? '', 
  i asked `` what does ` natural ' mean anyway ? '', 
  sorry if that was too vague , but i thought that it was understandable from the context that i was talking on a philosophical level , not asking for a dictionary . 
  it 's like someone asking `` what is desirable '' ? 
  and someone then saying `` well , the dictionary says desirable is ` worth having or wanting ' '' and then leaving it at that . 
   i have already explained countless times why it is not necessarily [ irrational to buy into the dichotomy that the naturalistic fallacy proposes ] , at least not obviously . 
  i get that you 're saying : `` but people do n't trust unnatural stuff because we have more reliable knowledge about nature than all the shit we have just produced ourselves '' , but that 's does n't invalidate the `` bears ! '', 
  rebuttal to the naturalistic fallacy . 
  ( in fact , it 's almost socratic . ), 
  it just explains * why * people buy into the naturalistic fallacy . 
  but understanding why people believe in something does n't make it more rational . 
  do n't get me wrong , though , you are right about what you say . 
  i do think that what you said has value in the bigger context . 
  just saying `` bears '' is n't convincing because it just falsifies one fallacy . 
  it 's shitty in the sense that it does n't really equip you for anything better , let alone convince anyone . 
  your reasoning has * far * more value in that sense . 
   there is . 
  there is n't . 
   you 're not smarter than the dictionary . 
  the dictionary does not possess reasoning capabilities , nor does it address issues on a philosophical level , so i * do * think i am smarter than a dictionary . 
   the fear of the unknown is perfectly rational and exactly what i was getting at . 
  to which `` nature is dangerous too '' is a useless argument as nature being safer is not the point . 
  of course fear of the unknown is rational . 
  but `` nature is dangerous too '' is not meant to show that fear of the unknown is irrational , it is meant to show that the dichotomy of natural vs unnatural is irrational , * which is exactly what the naturalistic fallacy does * . 
  which means that your criticism of the rebuttal to the naturalistic fallacy is irrelevant . 
   when it 's about the definition of a word , it kinda is . 
  a dictionary is not prescriptive , so even that i would doubt , but this is n't about the definition of a word . 
  it 's about the nature of the subject of conversation . 
  do you * have * to be so rude and abrasive ? 
  i am kind and reasonable with you . 
  please do me the same courtesy . 
  the dictionary definition is merely descriptive and a dictionary is definitely not the end of a discussion , let alone `` pointless pedantry '' . 
  you say that you do not support the most common rebuttal to the naturalistic fallacy ( `` nature is shitty , too '' ) , because we do n't know enough about new `` unnatural '' stuff . 
  i say to that : there is no distinction between `` natural '' and `` unnatural '' to begin with . 
  it 's just fear of the unknown repackaged in dichotomies of `` natural '' vs unnatural '' or `` chemicals '' , which the rebuttal of `` nature is dangerous too '' shows to be nonsense . 
  but why is synthesizing not natural ? 
  why is * anything * we do not natural ? 
  we build flats , so do ants . 
  the bombardier beetle has its own chemical factory in its body that creates a boiling hot liquid 1,4-benzoquinone as defense mechanism . 
  our `` unnatural '' factories have facilitated the evolution of a nylon-eating bacterium . 
  what i 'm trying to establish here is that there is n't really a difference between `` natural '' and `` artificial '' . 
  or rather , / r/gaming quality : `` dae remember this gem ? '', 
  and then post a picture of super mario bros. 
  je trouvai le rosbif !, 
  hah , mask . 
  i remember watching this episode where the bad guys were doing some mining operations in a mountain somewhere . 
  and the heroes said that they should take a look what 's going on , `` because whatever they are up to , it ca n't be good ! '', 
  even as a kid that sounded * very * weird to me . 
  we did n't have very good role models in cartoons . 
  i hear this a lot , but i think that 's just another nostalgic `` when i was your age ... '' thing . 
  for example , * avatar : the last airbender * was an amazing show . 
  compared to what we had in the 80s and 90s , we really had some very shitty stuff . 
  everything was black and white . 
  there was barely any conflict in the characters and the shows in general were full of corny and moralistic nonsense . 
  animaniacs famously bucked that whole trend and even went out of its way to make fun of it at times in [ their many wheel of morality segments ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv6iwx1_xhq ) . 
  i really think kids shows have gotten much better since then , with characters that fight their inner demons , real character development , full story arcs , etc. 
  that 's the norm now . 
  hell , even the thundercats reboot is [ pretty damn fantastic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tczwuowvh-s ) even if it has a different very flavour to the original . 
  nowadays cartoons can properly deal with [ issues such as betrayal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj5ikr25xsi ) because viewers have spent more than 10 minutes getting invested in them . 
  i 'm going to invoke betteridge 's law of headlines and say : `` no . 
  nobody else remembers this cartoon . 
  just you . '', 
  not just conservative christians either . 
  a classmate of mine ( who does n't believe in any particular god ) is an anti-vaxer . 
  still thinks that there is mercury in our vaccines . 
  but what does the word `` natural '' mean anyway ? 
  everything is `` chemicals '' after all .
