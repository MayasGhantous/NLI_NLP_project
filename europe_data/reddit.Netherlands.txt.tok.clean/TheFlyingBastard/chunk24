  it 's simple : life has sex , humans require intimacy . 
  it 's one of those bottom layers of maslow 's pyramid of needs . 
  trust me , just sucking it up and fapping is really not a solution - i was told by a cult i could n't do anything more than that , and it 's wrecking . 
  let 's compare it to something more cut and dry : proper diets . 
  it 'd be like she said : `` what if i told you proper meals are n't a need and people can just suck it up and just eat chips every day ? '', 
  i 'd say she 's wrong , and hopefully you 'd agree with that . 
  or would you then say : `` if you say she 's wrong about that , then you believe murdering men , women and children to steal their food can be justified '' ? 
  that 's a non-sequitur , as well as an incredibly backhanded way to appeal to emotion . 
  you should go into politics . 
   what if i told you prostitution is rape in almost all cases as well ? 
  what if i told you most prostituted people start as prostituted children ? 
  then i 'd say there 's an issue with the way the industry is built up . 
   what if i told you sex is n't a need and men can just suck it up and masturbate instead ? 
  then i 'd say you 're wrong . 
  why do you always have to one-up us ? 
  i had to look it up , but [ i found it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/43tzti/young_migrants_attack_elderly_men_after_they/czl2wm1 ) . 
   are you seriously making excuses for the pieces of shit in this video ? 
  what is wrong with you ? 
  whoops !, 
  you seem to have responded to / u/boreras without actually having read what they said !, 
  that 's okay , that can happen from time to time . 
  go ahead and try again . 
  hardly backtracking , as / u/caffeinatedt said `` among natives '' . 
  then , when you did n't accept the proposed situation , they said : `` then take town x , y or z '' . 
  / u/caffeinatedt was being flexible because you seemed to completely miss the point they were making in the first place . 
  your moral implications on a subject are yours and yours alone . 
  apparently german law ( rightfully ) makes a distinction between forced sex with anyone and sex with someone who is willing but not legally allowed to consent . 
  ah yes , good point . 
  the mentats mentioned in the novel all have red stained lips , though . 
  so , `` like [ nonanone ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nonanone ) '' would be `` nonanonina '' ? 
   just write that debt off . 
  yeah , but where 's the fun in that ? 
  why , of all countries , would you be patriotic for the us ? 
  that place is cray-cray . 
  it 'd probably be pretty cool to create a d&d campaign in a pseudo-netherlands , with very loosely translated etymologies for geographical names . 
  the underplane has several cities . 
  its capital city is waterbarrier , but the king 's council works in the patrician woods . 
  not far from there is a giant harbour city , chokemarsh . 
  further inland , the city of riverpass makes a centre for the underplane residents to gather . 
  north of the rivers , people tend to be practical , but below the two rivers ( the wet road and the crooked river ) , are the everglades . 
  its inhabitants are hedonistic , loving their feasts more than anything . 
  their biggest city , evermore gardens , functions as their nexus , where traders , tourists and partygoers yearly celebrate meatrobbery , a tradition filled with good ale , excellent food and joyful singing . 
  ... ominous ... ? 
  i guess it 's because ` holland ' `` feels '' cozier . 
  it 's `` our '' word . 
  ` the netherlands ' is so ... serious and political . 
  `` hey guys !, 
  we still exist !, 
  we 're totally going to hurt you , you know ! '', 
  what makes it even better is nrc 's target audience : highly educated people working as consultants or in the financial sector and jobs like that , who like their articles very in-depth . 
  i feel awkward for the poor germans . 
   trump was praised this week by putin , who described the billionaire businessman as a `` very colourful , talented person '' . 
  putin 's words fuelled attacks by trump 's rivals for the republican nomination . 
  i can just imagine putin giggling to himself before letting that press report out . 
  `` let 's see what they make of this . '', 
   promiscuity is exactly the act of being indiscriminate in the choice of sexual partners . 
  which , again , is not the same as being trustful of complete strangers . 
  promiscuous people can be careful or careless . 
  i 'm running into plenty of profiles that do n't have the right now option ticked under looking for . 
  as well as couples looking for chats and friends . 
  i mean you can filter on it , if you want , but ... 
  it means from an area roughly to the west of gemony . 
  yeah !, 
  like he said , a romantic atmosphere !, 
   it really starts to beg the question [ you probably mean `` raise the question '' ] ( http://begthequestion.info/ ) . 
   love , your friendly local language nazi . 
   do you think moment of silence happening in one and a half thausand kms away will help people ? 
  well not the victims , obviously . 
  but it helps the people having the silence . 
  it 's good for morale and social cohesion . 
  always the poets , these people . 
  irrelevant . 
  i 'm just answering your question . 
   i believe the text was added to erase any ambiguity about what the image is referencing . 
  so not only is the picture useless , it treats its audience like idiots . 
  i see . 
  yeah , it 's a bit lazy . 
  it 's not a exactly a clever or thought-provoking image , nor does it make any kind of statement , really . 
  it 's just kinda ... there . 
  ... thanks , but i do n't think anyone has missed that . 
  :p i am specifically referring to `` france 2015 '' . 
  why not let the bloody flag stand on its own ? 
  why add that line to the picture ? 
  / u/rurikton said this is actually in bad taste , so i assume there 's something i 'm missing that makes it so ? 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  such speculation is just better fit for a comment section than tweets gathered on storify and then reposted to reddit as a new submission . 
  is that `` france 2015 '' referring to anything ? 
  `` when i am the weaker , i ask you for my freedom , because that is your principle ; but when i am the stronger , i take away your freedom , because that is my principle . '', 
   a senile old woman saying things she does n't even understand is that the case ? 
  do n't be silly . 
  it 's the weekend . 
  so much for `` location , location , location '' . 
   also , hunger strikes work best in prisons they are housed in what used to be a prison . 
  does that count ? 
  edit : heh , / r/europe does n't understand jokes . 
  wonderful . 
   as a muslim interesting , i would n't picture a follower of shia islam regularly saying : '' [ fuck islam ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ke2b2/saudi_offers_to_build_200_mosques_in_germany_for/cuwt7la?context=3 ) '' and '' [ fuck mohammed ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3p81xj/kissing_scene_brings_iranian_kurdish_director_six/cw4qvgf?context=3 ) '' . 
  all this shit about refugees not accepting this or that and generally acting like spoiled children sounds very shady to me in and of itself . 
  we never get their side of the story and that makes me * extremely * suspicious of anything that gets posted here . 
  there 's this place in amsterdam , called het begijnhof .
