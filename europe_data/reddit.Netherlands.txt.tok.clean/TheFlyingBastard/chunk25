  it 's a small courtyard just off the crowded spui street . 
  i never knew it was there until i was one day walking through the bustling crowd and saw a small street off to my right . 
  in a spirit of adventure i decided to check it out and as soon as i stepped through the gates of the courtyard , the murmuring of the spui just vanished as if it were magic . 
  it was so quiet - where the spui had you raising your voice , this place had you turn down your volume to a whisper . 
  it does n't take a lot to find calm area , even in the centre of amsterdam . 
  what got me especially is how blatantly uncaring that whole referendum was . 
  the guy who started that whole shit said himself that he really does n't care about the issue . 
  it 's just the first stick he could find to beat the eu with . 
  how do you think we learned to read ? 
   someone living in a red country , i really hate our dubbing culture here . 
  on the upside , you guys damn good translators . 
  got ta appreciate that . 
  never knew . 
  all we learn is that we came there with the vereenigde oost-indische compagnie ( dutch east indian company ) , set down some farmers there and supported their violent expansion . 
  we do n't have any romantic notions about that time . 
  but then i guess these are not actually dutch people but south-africans , the descendants of the settlers . 
  thanks . 
   people circle the wagons when the indians come or they 're told they 're coming . 
  ... what ? 
  what does that mean ? 
   potatoes larger than 8 to 10 centimeters are not fit for human consumption . 
  any potato larger than 12 centimeters is considered abnormal due to over fertilization with ammonium nitrate , and should only be used as animal feed . 
  \\ - / u/source-direct, 
   yes but you can say this for any age . . what makes 16 any different ? 
  why not raise the age to something like 25 so you can be sure they are an adult ? 
  right , that 's my point : based on an age is kind of ridiculous , but as a lawmaker you need to draw a concrete line and age is the most clear . 
  which kinda sucks , because the whole subject is not that black and white . 
  right , article 247 lists a whole bunch of states where people are powerless - they are unconscious , crippled , sick , retarded , etc. 
  and then suddenly they go '' ... or they 're younger than 16 '' . 
  weird chapter . 
  i see how it 's necessary to have a legalese version of the law out , but it would be nice if they had a jip & janneke version of this shit . 
  well , there is the problem in that the flat age . 
  13 year olds can not give consent and considered to be easily deceived or coerced , but the day they turn 14 they are suddenly mature enough to make the right decision for themselves ? 
  that 's just weird . 
  ~ ~ that 's what i said , right ? ~ ~ oh !, 
  wait , i see what you mean . 
  if there 's penetration of someone between 12 and 16 the sentence is higher . 
  sorry , my bad . 
  you 're right , it 's a flat 16 here . 
  thing is , if you write a law , you have to try and make it broadly applicable . 
  how can you say when someone is able to give consent ? 
  for example , would a 9 year old be able to give consent ? 
  a 10 year old ? 
  at some point you get to this grey area where some people can give informed consent and others ca n't , but how , as a lawmaker , can you make a concrete judgment on whether or not the younger person is capable of making that decision ? 
  read art 245 on the same page you linked to . 
  i had to double check this . 
  i always thought the netherlands was on the low end , but it turns out 16 is [ actually a relatively high age of consent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_europe#/media/file:age_of_consent_in_europe.svg ) . 
  ~ ~ then again , we have this weird tiered system where it can be 12 if no penetration takes place , so there 's that . ~ ~, 
  a * dys * topian future ? 
  there was that episode about [ racism being silly ] ( https://futuretom.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/star-trek.jpg ) so roddenberry sure was into delivering social commentary ... 
  [ it 's terrible , but it was that time you know ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic6w8j0j8co ), 
  and then there was sulu from a country on the `` wrong side of ww2 '' . 
  i do n't think it was supposed to say that `` even evil russians can be good '' just that people from all ethnicities can work together . 
   if that 's not a thinly veiled propaganda , then i do n't know what is . 
  well , it 's not thinly veiled ... 
   this is what happens to `` non-binding '' in the netherlands . 
  this tends to happen especially when there is a lot of misinformation floating around and the driving force behind the referendum did n't really give a shit about the issue at all . 
  [ triggered ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/si7woawqrubga/giphy.gif ), 
  well , it 's this or people talking in circles just so they wo n't offend you as if you were some mewling infant ... :p, 
  i think the belgians have a better sense of humour than we do . 
  but do n't tell that to / u/jebusgobson . 
  we 'll never live it down . 
  please , yank / u/flavius29663 's chain a bit more . 
  that was pretty damn interesting . 
   assuming that you mention this to point out that he did n't pay for them i 'm not . 
  :p in fact , he said * he * had to replace the stuff , which means he had to do it himself and not get it from some customer service rep or something , so suggesting that he did n't pay would be silly on my part . 
  what did you pay for them ? 
  there 's also discord , which has apps for android and ios and desktop clients for windows , linux and osx . 
  as a bonus , not only does it cover whatsapp 's use cases , but also that of skype . 
  and teamspeak . 
  closed source though . 
   makes me wish i could go back in time and change some maps to get south america a different name . 
  that 'd pretty much fix it . 
  there 's canada , so i would still call you a usian . 
  i think what he 's trying to say is : `` and people say * rome * is n't built in a day , wait till you see the eiffel tower ! '', 
  i 'm not sure what the punch line is here , as pretty much any building project takes more than one day ... 
  we had a disproportional amount of jews here who were all very well documented ( as / u/kadirmarangoz said ) . 
  probably the most in western europe , almost ten times as much as the whole of scandinavia if we can we believe [ this page ] ( https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?moduleid=10005161 ) . 
  so the amount of jews captured can not be used as support for a claim that the dutch were not neutral - especially when you consider how the netherlands behaved in the time leading up to ww2 . 
  on an aside , it also neatly underlines the importance of privacy in the 21st century and that people wake up and get pissed off at the massive amounts of data that is gathered on each and every one of us individually . 
  he 's talking about major protests , not general assistance . 
  i purposefully left out the details you are steering towards because i did n't want to come across like i was bragging that the dutch were the only ones standing up like that and then paint a victim narrative by saying that the nazis totally wrecked them . 
  people can read that in the wikipedia article i linked to and it leaves my comment with a bit more style . 
  i guess it 's been too long since we 've had a good conflict to remind us . 
   if the dutch decide to annex us , i 'd be willing to defend my country . 
  annex you ? 
  why , little brother , we would never dream of dragging you back home . 
  we 've always said that wallonia was an abusive spouse , so whenever you 're ready , the door is open for you . 
   i 'm a programmer so could probably help out in some kind of cyber war . 
  you could probably make a gorgeous propaganda website . 
  eh , we just never cared . 
  usually when a war raged , the netherlands tried to stay neutral . 
  for example in ww2 there was this trade thing going on with england and germany , i think . 
  we did not dare piss of either so we just kinda stayed in the middle . 
  did n't want to get overrun by either of them , you know . 
  in the end it happened anyway , even though we were little more than the next exit left to france . 
  it was n't until jews started disappearing that dutch people actually [ got off their neutral asses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/february_strike ) , but you know how these things go . 
  the next day that was over . 
  i guess it 's kinda in our culture to just keep our heads down and weather the storm .
