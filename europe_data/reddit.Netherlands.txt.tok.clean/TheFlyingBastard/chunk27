  well , as he said , it 's a sensible location for a naval resupply base . 
  if you have your forces on the front , you need a place to fall back to . 
  then why not kalingrad ? 
  googling yields a lot of results of a chicken on a background of a russian flag asking for evidence of a claim . 
  no idea what the relationship is . 
  better . 
  thank you !, 
  is there a different source i can read ? 
  we 'll take brussels . 
  and the rest of flanders . 
  welcome home , little brother . 
  you 're right , rubygeek 's definition of indoctrination does n't quite cut it . 
  seeing as you 're from the us you are likely intimately familiar with children swearing loyalty to the flag . 
  in a lot of western countries that is seen as indoctrination too , and that has little to do with truth values . 
  i 'd say indoctrination is forcing religious , political or social doctrines on people through any other method than rational argument ( eg . 
  peer pressure , lying , dangling carrots , etc. ) . 
  would that be a better definition ? 
  you 're right , it 's not really satire . 
  it 's just trolling . 
  which is why i said it 's not even * good * satire . 
  it 's just repeating a silly opinion without any point added to it . 
  you might as well just have the real thing show up . 
  it 's not even * good * satire , especially since there are plenty usians who hold that exact opinion . 
  i do n't get this joke ... 
  there 's a vassal module , but that does n't count i guess . 
  i remember playing that game when i was a kid . 
  it was an amazing game . 
  really worth playing with a group . 
  it had a cool cap for mr. x so the detectives would n't be able to look at his eyes . 
  also that feeling when the detectives were on one end of the map and you managed to escape in the nick of time with a couple of black tickets via the thames and the underground . 
  the reveal of your current position was the best after that . 
  could you just leave , please ? 
  you 're are shitting up a discussion that was very decent until you came in and started name-calling . 
   but for pete 's sake only if he 's black , dammit . 
  sure . 
  could you upvote [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4inz3z/four_seriously_hurt_in_munich_station_attack/d2zytl9 ) and [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4inz3z/four_seriously_hurt_in_munich_station_attack/d2zy6j4 ) while you 're at it ? 
  would n't want people to get as confused as you just got , right ? 
   and while you 're busy , could you also answer my question ? 
  i 'm * really * curious who my own kind is supposed to be . 
  edit : what 's wrong , / u/theogr ? 
  wo n't you answer my question ? 
  did you go back to downvoting again ? 
  you were so good at schooling me on shit i did n't say !, 
  sure , not in this case . 
  the guy is obviously just batshit so who knows what his motivations are . 
  i 'm just saying that if people are trying to get a theocracy going , such attacks can be very well politically motivated , especially when they claim a divine mandate . 
  politics and religion in the same cart , you know ... 
   even your own kind have given up and are deleting their comments . 
  who is my `` own kind '' and why would i care about other people deleting their comments ? 
  am i supposed to be intimidated by that ? 
   yet you continue to argue that a verifiably insane german drug addict who is stabbing random people in a tiny irrelevant town is ... political activism for islam as the rule of law . 
  i did n't argue that at all . 
  history - nay , * life itself * will never cease to amaze you at this rate . 
  sure . 
  stabbing random people might very well be a tool for political action . 
  you should look into the history of terrorism . 
  violence has always been a very common tool . 
  i was speaking in a hypothetical situation in response to what / u/pwndbyautocorrect said , but nonetheless interesting in the context of this event . 
  if your goal is to fight for islam as the rule of law , then yes , such attacks would be political . 
  you 've got to be shitting me . 
   `` the clip is deeply offensive and no reasonable person can possibly find the content acceptable in today 's society , '' detective inspector david cockburn of the lanarkshire cid told the telegraph . 
  piss off , cockburn . 
  i thought the video was fucking hilarious . 
  no reasonable person finds your employment acceptable . 
  the articles on that website do seem a tad on the sensationalist side . 
  i saw a link to an article about that woman who claims to have been punched by a trump supporter ( a claim i 'm very skeptical of ) and the headline alone was written as outrage porn . 
  thanks , i 'm definitely going to check out if i can combine some of these locations , if only for a long weekend . 
  to be fair to the belgians , he was n't exactly hiding in plain sight . 
  he did n't actually leave the house for all those months . 
  the parody website * de speld * ( which is like the dutch version of * the onion * ) posted a small article about '' [ abdeslam 's fascinating three-month journey through europe ] ( http://hooiberg.speld.nl/speld.nl/wp-content/uploads/route-670x375.jpg ) '' . 
   calmly maintaining the rule of law and due process instead of retaliatory vengeance and/or fear-mongering is why europe is screwed \\ - / u/farmerfoo, 
  thanks . 
  i really should visit some time . 
  you guys have some gorgeous places ( and quite frankly the smoothest dutch you can find anywhere ) . 
  maybe this summer vacation ... just grab a train and go ... where do you think i should totally go , keeping in mind i like peace , history and gezelligheid over crowds and parties ? 
   once they tell you to speak like a civilized person , not sure you 'll be loving the belgians no more . 
  tough love , dude . 
  flanders is our little bro whether you like it or not . 
  not even if i catch you during tea ? 
  there 's something weird about allah and unbelievers . 
  i 've read a bit of the quran out of interest and at some point it just went : `` allah has blinded the unbelievers to the truth . '', 
  and then it kinda goes `` yeah , those people who have heard of islam and still do n't see the truth of it - their skins will be burned off in hell , and then they 'll be given new skins to burn some more . 
  man , allah is an awesome guy . '', 
  it 's like ... what do you want , dude ? 
  ehh , i was raised a jehovah 's witness . 
  it made me a total gullible idiot at the time , so that may be mitigating circumstances surrounding my hypothetically ringing your doorbell . 
  would n't mean i 'm less guilty of waking you , of course . 
  yeah , but the tribunal had already convicted him , right ? 
  i 'm kinda confused about the system this is going through . 
  blessed be her hips . 
  ah look , i can read that at least . 
  thanks !, 
  hmm ... `` it was a heretic . 
  an enemy of allah . 
  that 's why i tore his head off . '', 
  yeah , that does n't sound like someone who is at all sorry . 
  what a shit . 
  i can see why the judge would do what he did , but honestly , i would n't take the risk . 
  the man is already dangerous , he is declared guilty by a tribunal ... let him launch his appeals from jail . 
  as for your small edit : sure .
