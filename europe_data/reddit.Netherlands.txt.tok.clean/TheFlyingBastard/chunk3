   you 're talking about an `` is '' , nitroxious was talking about an `` ought '' . 
  if they are allowed to wear a burqa on religious grounds , he * ought * to be able to wear a skimask for the same reasons . 
  so i 'll ask the question again : if one person * ought * to be able to choose their garb based on their private religious convictions , why * ought * another person not be able to choose their garb based on their private religious convictions ? 
  popularity is not a reason for why something is fair and neither is `` the evidence of a worldwide religion '' since that constitutes ... well , exactly nothing . 
  so you 're going to have to be a bit more specific in why his ought is not valid . 
  even if that was true , i do n't see how that is relevant . 
  ah , but you 're talking about an `` is '' , nitroxious was talking about an `` ought '' . 
  if * they * are allowed to wear a burqa on religious grounds , he * ought * to be able to wear a skimask for the same reasons . 
  this is not unreasonable . 
  it does n't soon happen because of the reason you mentioned ( even though pasta streamers * did * happen ) , but it 's a decent ought . 
  but you * are * giving it as a counter-argument . 
  he 's just questioning its validity . 
   you really could n't . 
  why not ? 
  it happened for pasta streamers . 
  exactly , i 'd love to have flanders join us . 
  it 'll be like our little brothers came back . 
  plus , they make all the good kid shows . 
  right . 
  perhaps they can save some money by not illegally retaining all our data . 
  surely not recording everything about us will save some money . 
   that being said , not all southerners follow the stereotype strictly either , so generalizing the south as bigots is a bit harsh . 
  i remember this segment on the daily show where they took two guys to diners in the reddest , most right-wing states . 
  one of the guys would propose to the other . 
  nobody gave a shit . 
  except at one diner , where some people clapped for them . 
  i mean , how cool is that , cutting through the stereotypes like that ? 
  then please do enlighten me - if it 's supposed to be figurative , what are they trying to say ? 
  because if it 's not a literal , rhetorical question , and it is n't a generic , inept anti-war statement , i have no clue what this is supposed to mean . 
  i sure hope that 's not supposed to be a deep and meaningful lyric . 
  `` why do n't presidents fight the war ? '', 
  yes , wonderful idea , soad . 
  let 's send presidents . 
  let 's completely forget about anything we have learned in the past few millennia about organization , chain of command , warfare in any form etc. 
  and put the leader in direct danger . 
  that 'll teach them !, 
  i 'm real big on pacifism , but gods , that 's some naive teenage-level bullshit right there . 
  that 's ... actually pretty mild . 
  making fun of their weather ? 
  i expected something incredibly vindictive . 
   and that 's because europe is n't that multicultural holy shit . 
  i bet you think you 're irish/italian/french too , depending on where you great-grandparents were from before they came to the us . 
  umbrellas ? 
  what 's that referring to ? 
  a swede talking shit about danes . 
  i 'm not going to get in the middle of this one . 
  holy shit . 
  that 's all i have to say about that . 
  to be fair , some flemish [ might as well be danish for how ( un ) intelligible it is to us ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=wk3t23ayrg4#t=57 ) . 
  like `` kissing ass '' ? 
  i was raised a jehovah 's witness , a christian fundamentalist creationist cult . 
  yes , it is a big deal . 
  the way creationism is taught , the way it is anti-science , etc. 
  makes it poison . 
  it needs to warp young minds to think in ways that make them unfit to think about real life - i 've had to relearn that at least . 
  it 's not just ` oh , he believes in god ' . 
  it 's the process behind creationism that is shit . 
  plus , it 's factually inaccurate , so it has no business in schools anyway . 
   we are regular people pretending we know something reddit summed up in a few words ... 
   and i say this as a russian . 
  you 're a long way from home ... 
  canada has our respect , that 's for sure . 
  as i recall , it was mostly canadians that liberated the netherlands along with the help of the british and some other countries . 
  any americans participating were rolled up with the british second army . 
  i remember liberation day in 1995 , when they had tanks with canadian flags rolling through the streets of my ( relatively small ) town tossing chocolate to the crowd . 
  it was pretty cool . 
   this is perfectly understandable and exceeds `` simple conversation '' skills i 'm relieved to see someone say that . 
  i was playing guild wars 2 last week and a german guy started talking to me ... in german . 
  i felt quite embarrassed for the difficulty i had communicating with the guy : `` ja , ich spreche ein bischen deutsch , aber es ist schwierig fur mich. . manchmal brauche ich ein website fur \u00dcbersetzungen und das ist wirklich ein schande ... '' i mean , it worked out in the end , but i feel so embarrassed about these difficulties that i do n't even mention german on my resume . 
  thing is , chodechugging 's comment is bordering word salad . 
  there 's nothing to state since chodechugging 's claims are utterly vapid . 
  honestly , yeah , your government * should * first take care of its own citizens , give them proper healthcare , proper education everywhere , etc. 
  seriously , americans deserve to have more spent on them in ways that directly benefits them . 
  i 'm a fan of whomever has our interests online covered . 
  two of our most active parties on that front , the pirate party and greenleft , are part of the greens , so i just happen to be okay with them . 
  if other coalitions do the same thing , i 'm fine with that too . 
  thanks , flanders . 
  you guys are the best . 
   i see . 
  so you 're saying that people are free , but they 're not free to do specific things that you find immoral/wrong/stupid etc. 
  some people do n't seem grow past the `` eww , cooties '' stage . 
  corrupt ? 
  in what way ? 
  inept , sure , but corrupt ? 
   furthermore , you 're incapable of moderation . 
  you 're authoritarian . 
  [ delicious copypasta ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/bad_cop_no_donut/comments/265qyf/man_cooked_to_death_in_scalding_shower_as/ ) . 
  no gold for you , though . 
  it 's like i 'm back in church all over again . 
  we had a lot of terrible speakers who did that ... 
  no ... no , i think i 'll say it anyway . 
  sharp . 
  might just be . 
  i always love to see reactions like this . 
  as angry drops of spittle pass their lips and they toss their incoherent `` warbrlahallargh '' reactions on public websites , i just feel a lot better knowing that no matter how ill-informed i am about politics and terrible i am at discussing political issues , at least i 'm not as ill-informed and kneejerky as these people . 
  i still voted pirate party , despite knowing that they would n't get a seat . 
  it 's not effective right now , but it 's still moral support to the pirates themselves , plus a message to everyone else that we are out there . 
  after all , if people never vote for a party because they think they would n't get a seat anyway ... well , they would never get enough votes for a seat . 
  i want to be part of the group that gives you a reason to vote for the party that * does * represent your interests . 
   germany is very strct when it comes to what lane to drive on the autobahn , add to this that the drivers license exam is one of the most difficult in the world .
