  at least it beats gendered nouns . 
  no fucking reason for that whatsoever . 
  where does this thing about his hands come from , btw ? 
  did he ever brag about it or something ? 
  sure , but i tend to look at the places where people live their lives , not the places that were explicitly set up to be pretty like tourist traps . 
  if you would walk off the via sacra or via nova , you 'd be surrounded by the slums . 
  rulers simply were n't in power for long enough to make a proper change in city planning , so buildings popped up where they were needed at that time . 
  the insulae in which people lived were prestige projects - races by the builders who could build the highest building . 
  it 's not like the building codes were ever enforced , so the apartments would be tiny and haphazardly built , with no water or anything and prone to collapse ( which was okay , because that meant another chance to build an even higher building , yay ! ) . 
  the epistles of horace described how people with their beasts would push themselves through the crowds , together with the funeral mourners , mad dogs and filthy pigs . 
  the only way for people to find their way through the mud-street chaos was by paying attention to landmarks like large trees or derelict temples ( which romans would never demolish because they were so devout ) . 
  macedonians would laugh at the way rome was planned . 
  even cicero was embarrassed about it . 
  he reports that the capuans jeered at the romans and looked down their noses as they mocked rome for her attics teetering over the road , which were all pretty hopeless and had all these cramped back alleys . 
  besides being winding , chaotic and muddy , the city would also be shit-clogged . 
  since people in the insulae had no water , they had to gather their shit and piss in pots . 
  sometimes it would be gathered as fertiliser for the gardens outside the city , but there so was always so much it would gather inside the houses . 
  the plebeians just stopped bothering and tossed it out the window onto the head of the crowds below . 
  so yes , if you followed the tourist guide , rome would be a gorgeous place . 
  but if you had to opportunity to roam freely , you 'd be tripping over corpses . 
  if you entered through the eastern gate you would have seen the smog coming from the city pretty early , noticed the shanty towns around the place and the bones on the side of the road , so you would n't have been surprised to see rome as the shit-clogged , winding , mud-street chaos it was . 
  yeah , but rome was a shit-clogged , winding mud-street chaos . 
  probably got confused by all the bicycles . 
   that tale about the kid that saved holland with his finger ( pretty popular tale here in catalonia ) ... well it did n't help me neither xd that 's what you get for listening to americans . 
  okay , i 'll try to keep it to one story . 
  though you wo n't get a proper sense of the scummy behaviour going on here , i 'm going to omit a lot of stuff otherwise it 'll be a total tl ; dr. 
  it 'll still be a lot , but the basic gist revolves around a website called wizardchan , which is a site for 30 year old virgins . 
  i do n't mean that in a snarky way , it literally is that : a support website for people who have trouble talking to others at best and are deeply depressed and lonely virgins at worst . 
  one day , on wizardchan , someone posted [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dk1rvav.png ) . 
  these posts were up for an hour until they were removed because wizardchan had been trying out a `` no discussion about women allowed '' policy . 
  who posted it is still unknown , though we know from the ips that [ it was n't someone who had ever posted on that website before ] ( https://i.imgur.com/balpvkah.png ) . 
  there is a hypothesis that [ it was someone from the cwcwiki ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o8du4to.png ) , since they liked to start shit on wc . 
  anyway , somehow quinn got there within the hour that it was up , and then claimed that this was harassment ... even though this was just one or two posts from first timers talking shit in a sea of depressed beta virgins . 
  she did n't stop after the first claim either . 
  she went on and on and on . 
  she claimed that people [ from wizardchan ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dorixl2.png ) `` got [ her ] phone number and jerked off into [ her ] phone '' ( i guess wizards have a very recognisable way of jerking off into phones ? ), 
  and that she got `` raided '' . 
  no proof , no evidence , just assertions . 
  you 'd think that being so intimately familiar with raids and doxxing , [ being an old something awful instigator of harassment herself under the name of erin and all ] ( http://thisismybutt.com/del/%23pokegoons.20090525.log.htm ) , she 'd know how to keep a record of this shit . 
  but it was a story that certain media outlets could run [ with ] ( http://gimmegimmegames.com/2013/12/depression-quest-developer-harassed-female-game-developer/ ) . 
  that gave a good publicity boost to her game , which finally got greenlit after having been turned down before for generally being shit . 
  meanwhile , the depressed 30 year old virgins with social anxiety that were accused of calling a woman and being sexually intimidating ... ( yes , really ) ... [ were not heard ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ruqgi2h.png ) . 
  then there was also quinn pretending like she got doxxed or something and also the time when she lied about and sabotaged a gamejam , but i 'd have to spend some more time digging through almost three year old material to get those stories straight . 
  in what way do you mean that ? 
  are you asking what i think her motivation is , or are you asking what my reasons are for saying she did ? 
   ok , so you doubt she was actually harassed ? 
  `` considering she had to instigate and fabricate harassment , i seriously doubt ** it was as bad as she said ** '' . 
  as you say , people get harassed all the time ( even i got `` harassed '' when i suggested that maybe it 's a bit silly to judge trump 's fitness to govern from the way he eats his steak ) . 
  she just tried to instigate and fabricate a bit more so she was more of a victim than everyone else . 
  that makes her unfit to be propped up as `` a victim of harassment '' by default . 
  which was the original complaint . 
   ok , let 's back up for a second because we 're losing focus here . 
  alright , back to peace mode . 
   - do you deny that quin was the target of serious online harassment ? 
  considering she had to instigate and fabricate harassment , seriously doubt it was as bad as she said , and by extension i would say that the complaint that a liar and saboteur was propped up as a victim is totally justified . 
   - if not , do you think that harassment was justified ? 
  harassment is never justified . 
   no , i do n't get to decide why people get upset . 
  i do get to decide that it 's stupid . 
  you 're contradicting yourself . 
  you suggested that people should have gotten upset at the media outlets , but they did , and now you say that it 's stupid . 
   you keep saying i 'm ignorant , but fail to provide any facts why i would be wrong , nor are you able to refute my argumnts . 
  you 're not making arguments . 
  arguments have premises and conclusions . 
  all you are doing is making assertions that are bullshit , dishonest or both and employing a [ gish gallop ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gish%20gallop ) while you 're at it , which i 'll deal with * again * . 
  * you do n't address the fact that * why you 're wrong : i did so right [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gqtoi/brexit_ii_last_week_tonight_with_john_oliver_hbo/ditdpw5/ ) even to the point of quoting it . 
  your only response , however , was to ask why it is strange to ask about quinn . 
  so maybe you just completely forgot , i do n't know . 
  * she did n't receive any meaningful coverage by having sex with anyone . 
  * why you 're wrong : she received coverage on a front page post , including the title image . 
  she also received coverage for her game jam after having sabotaged another . 
  she also received awards from her friends . 
  why you 're dishonest : you shift goalposts ( `` more examples !, 
  '' ) , you put words in mouths ( '' you downplay the coverage , ignore the other examples and pretend that this is what kept the internet busy for a long time . 
  * this is about obscure stuff nobody would otherwise have ever heard of or care about and has nothing to do with the gaming industry as a whole . 
  * why you 're wrong : you 're not , actually . 
  in fact , it only supports what i 've been saying all along . 
  if it was n't for the cronyism in the industry , nobody would have cared . 
  but * because * this is about cronyism , not about a scorned ex , people * did * care . 
  why you 're dishonest : since it was correct , i 'm going to give this one the benefit of the doubt and assume it is n't dishonesty but just thoughtlessness . 
   people jumped on it because everybody loves a good witch hunt . 
  why you 're wrong : people jumped on it because it was a very clear example of how corrupt journalism has become . 
  why you 're dishonest : rather than * asking * why people responded the way they did , you * dictate * why they responded the way they did . 
  * harassing one lone indie developer rather than the companies where the actual money is * why you 're wrong : not only did the companies where the actual money is get a lot of shit , this lone indie developer had to instigate and subsequently fabricate her own harassment . 
  that was the kind of level of `` harassment '' she was getting . 
  why you 're dishonest : rather than * asking * what happened , you assumed and dictated with no evidence what happened , even after being told that the accusation is false . 
   i mean , seriously , you 're on the side of online harassment here . 
  i mean , seriously , stop with the baseless , bullshit assertions . 
  you are again showing that you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  it is the source of all the problems you have grasping the situation : you just assume that whatever you think happened , actually did happen . 
  and when faced with someone who is accused , you do n't stop and ask for clarification , you just repeat the same tired old nonsense . 
  i 'm going to put a crazy idea out there : be honest . 
  act in good faith . 
  ask questions . 
  i recognize who you are , and i know you definitely are n't an idiot , so stop acting like one , for fucks sake . 
  nobody gives a damn if you find it unconvincing , especially if you are trying your hardest to ignore or downplay examples . 
  it changes nothing about the facts . 
  you do n't get to decide why people got upset . 
  you do n't get to decide that people were upset at quinn instead of the journalists . 
  you do n't get to decide that the actual outlets were not getting shit .
