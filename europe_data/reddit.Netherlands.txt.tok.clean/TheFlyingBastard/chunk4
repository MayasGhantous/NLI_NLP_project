  that checks out . 
  the dutch exam is also supposedly ridiculously difficult and we 're on the lowest bracket as well . 
  i would n't know , i never tried it , but from what i 've heard from people who came here and redid the test . 
  you know , source : reddit and all that . 
  well , i liked his paintings ... 
  because serves to illustrate the point there is a niche for certain parties and there is no problem with that . 
  the party for animals is focused on agriculture and nature in general and the pirate party is focused on the internet . 
  so what ? 
  they both fill a niche that other parties do n't . 
  i absolutely loathe wilders for the media whoring and shit he spouts , but this ... 
  i like it as far as symbolism to make his position known goes . 
  still not going to get my vote tomorrow , though . 
  ... which he did when he failed to bridge the hellespont , if i recall correctly . 
  do n't worry though , we went far beyond [ bridging the waters ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/oosterscheldekering%2c_netherlands.jpg ) , so america [ wo n't ] ( http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/09/water_in_new_orleans_new_appro.html ) have to be flogging it any time soon . 
  [ hopefully ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmcquaid/2012/10/30/a-dutch-solution-for-new-yorks-storm-surge-woes/ ) . 
  that makes sense . 
  protip for anyone reading : photoshop has a proof setup option in the view menu which you can use to see what your pictures look like to people who are colourblind . 
  might want to use that before tossing your graphs , maps , etc online . 
  you guys are our long lost brothers . 
  right , that 's what i mean by `` lake '' . 
  we like to overstate our geographical features because we really have none ; there 's a hill in the south of the country which is called `` mount vaals '' , even though it 's just a little over 300 m high . 
  right , brittania rules the waves - but the dutch decide where the waves reach . 
  do you happen to be colourblind or something ? 
  i was here first . 
  american . 
  nonsense . 
  the waters do not rule us . 
  the dutch rule the waters . 
  our engineers decide where it goes and where it does n't go . 
  in fact , they told it to fuck off from the lake in the middle of our country and now there 's * an artificial island with cities and everything * . 
  here you are again . 
  it 's a small website , is n't it ? 
  no , you . 
  if it 's about starting to use a global language for international relations , i say we start singing in esperanto , just because it 's neutral . 
  that 's just the beat , though . 
  the rest sounds more like a country song . 
  i do n't know , it 's so utterly ridiculous it has gone full circle to being funny . 
  kinda like rick santorum talking about dutch old people being scared of going to the hospital , otherwise they 'll be involuntary euthanised and wearing `` do not euthanise me '' bracelets so they wo n't be part of those 10 % of all deaths . 
  and now some guy on russian tv says that copenhagen is a shithole ? 
  what can you do but laugh , really ? 
  completely contrary to the gay stereotype , i do n't follow eurovision . 
  what 's going on with austria 's song ? 
  true , but the only thing like that that we have in our country is king 's day , the birthday of our king . 
  which is pretty much only an excuse for everyone to go out and party . 
  in actuality we do n't give a shit about the king 's birthday . 
  in fact , i think football is the only thing that unites us is some way . 
  i just do n't see the point . 
  yeah , that was quite a head scratcher for me . 
  yay for the loose coalition of countries who happen to share a plot of land ? 
   voting is part of the democratic process , but it does n't automatically give you the results you want . 
  right , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  the `` democratic process '' does n't solve the problem at all . 
  and most of the rest of the south is ... what ? 
  protestant ? 
  voting does not solve the problem at all , and to filter out a submission you need to encounter it first so that just adds to the bother . 
   sarcasm was actually brought to the uk by the vikings says the danish ambassador . 
  ...  the british use of understatement and satire is thought to originate from the vikings ...  these eventually became part of everyday language , seen in some of the words and place names we use today , and ultimately in our caustic sense of humour . 
  ...  stemming from the vikings and some of the legacy they have left . 
  ...  that he believes could stem from expressions brought to the uk from the vikings he seems to think that the vikings brought a certain sarcastic flair to the uk . 
   sarcasm , irony and understatement are part of the `` common heritage '' between denmark and the uk says claus grube . 
  ...  which he says shows evidence of a common cultural heritage . 
  ...  `` i think this forms part of our common heritage ...  humour in the uk and denmark dates back to our shared history . 
  ... ... and that they thus have a common heritage . 
  one thing is clear at least :  `` it has always struck me that in the uk we have the same sense of humour as in denmark , '' ...  he has been struck by the similarities in british and danish comedy . 
  it is strikingly similar . 
   sure , but you 're free to skip reading those ? 
  only if it stays as it is : sporadic . 
  once it happens regularly , it 'll start taking up more space on the page . 
  then you ca n't just ignore it since it 'll be clogging up your page . 
  it 's like littering , really . 
  sure , you can just step over a plastic cup , but the more there are on the sidewalk , the bigger the problem becomes . 
   unlike the us , very few countries in europe are truly secular . 
  define `` truly '' , please . 
  is n't louisiana bible belt territory ? 
  surely most states are n't that bad , right ? 
  thing is , people will come and go `` hey , now tell us what you think of * us * ! '', 
  there 's more than a couple of countries out there and all the `` now do me `` s are getting a bit old . 
  ... which has turned into an alternative / r/offbeat , really . 
  greater internet fuckwad theory and all that . 
   i 'm baffled what people are finding to down-vote in your post . 
  i thought reddit was about encouraging debate . 
  oh you . 
  reddiquette is meaningless and in this voting system `` factually incorrect '' is the same as `` disagree '' and `` daft '' . 
  i mean , have you looked at an unmodified front page ? 
  reddit has n't been about encouraging debate for a while now . 
   thereby meaning that his usage of ` horse meat - no ' is incorrect . 
  oh , i see where our interpretations differ . 
  when he said `` ethically - yes '' , you assumed he 's referring to what krastain said ( `` there is nothing wrong with horse meat . '' ) . 
  i assumed he 's referring to what famousonmars said ( `` there fucking is [ something wrong with it ] when i was expecting beef . 
  yeah , well ... well ... fine . 
  you win this one . 
  in op 's defence , he seems to have copied the first sentence from the article , though :  shots fired : in a move to protect the health of its citizens , europe has ostensibly banned american apples from ever making it to their grocery store shelves . 
   do you guys in europe not care if the chinese place is cooking cats or chicken ? 
  i 've never eaten cat . 
  i 've heard it 's pretty tough meat . 
  i 'm not really attached to cats more than i am to chickens , otherwise . 
   the issue arises when there 's some horse in my beef and i have n't been told it 's there . 
  that 's what he meant by `` ethically '' . 
  it 's just not cool to lie to the consumer about the meat he 's getting . 
  `` wo n't anyone think of the prisoners ?! '',
