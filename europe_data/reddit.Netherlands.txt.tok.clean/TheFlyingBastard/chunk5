  you probably mean persecution . 
  prosecution is a little bit different ... , 
  gawker ? 
  writing bullshit clickbait headlines ? 
  say it is n't so !, 
  gods , i love the english sense of humour . 
  yes !, 
  polder is * fantastic * . 
  it 's a dutch word that other languages have loaned as is , too . 
  it 's even so iconic that an english proverb refers to it : `` god created the world , but the dutch created holland . '', 
  what more could you ask for ? 
  i 'm going to have to go with * water * or * van de zee * ( * of the sea * ) for the netherlands . 
  water is ubiquitous and very unremarkable . 
  it 's also something that we 're apparently really good at fighting through engineering projects and whatnot . 
  edit : the_double had an even better name : * polder * . 
   putin is heroicly manly really ? 
  i think he 's more like a bond villain , really . 
  well , that was distasteful . 
  also , whoever filmed this needs to learn how to use a cameraphone . 
  you * always * film in landscape mode . 
  gang shootouts in national parks , though ? 
  how would that even happen ? 
  are n't gangs supposed to be an urban phenomenon ? 
   you can just call our foreign ministry , where you 'll reach our answering machine that says `` we surrender ! '', 
  `` if you have a question about our political system , press 1 . 
  if you call to demand our immediate and unconditional surrender , press 2 ... '', 
   knowing english does not make one english or even an anglophile , but rather creates a common ground for discussion and allows for greater movement of talent across borders , which will allow us to get more comfortable with each other . 
  i still say we should all totally start speaking esperanto . 
  the part i like most about this reply is that i need to read it aloud to understand what it says . 
   our political system is a lot less stuffy i like it when they stand up and immediately sit down again . 
  but seriously , i love the drama of it all . 
  the shouting , the phrases used ( '' [ the right honourable member must sit down while i rise to my feet !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrzsh52l9hy ) '' ) , the history behind it all ( eg . 
  dragging a new speaker to their seat ) ... 
  it 's all quite fantastic to see . 
  it 's always amusing to see which way the coin will fall . 
  will it be the circlejerk or the counterjerk ? 
  what makes this joke even funnier is that [ someone seriously made that mistake ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/23gqw4/roma_qualify_directly_to_the_champions_league/cgwukvs ) . 
  that 's like saying : `` do n't complain about the shitty food here , boil your own egg . '', 
  just because i can make a decent boiled egg for myself , does n't mean all the other food on my plate does n't taste like crap . 
  meta-complaining ( or rather meta-discussion ) might be the least interesting way to conduct a discussion on this subject , but it 's also the * only * way . 
  the x-treme euroscope comes with energy drinks , skateboards and an electric guitar . 
  you have to appreciate the names astrophysicists come up with . 
  what do red giants and white dwarfs look like ? 
  what about black holes ? 
  well , it 's right there in the name ... 
   when china , its only benefactor at the time , sent it emergency aid north korea stole the train carrying it . 
  you know , if it were n't for millions of people suffering terribly and the concentration camps that are still active to this day , this would actually be quite funny . 
  `` yes , of course they were there . 
  what are you going to do about it , huh ? '', 
   another theory states the crosses stand for the three plagues that hit the city : water , fire , and the plague ( pestilence ) we 've always been an upbeat and positive crowd . 
   teeven says it 's not wise not to stop saving any information . 
  he made an example of how valuable data can be when a phone has been stolen so the thief can be found and prosecuted . 
   `` it 's important that you can just ask the provider what happened to that phone '' . 
  teeven thinks it 's `` extremely obvious '' that traffic data may be kept for some time . 
  oh , teeven , you old fool . 
  i ca n't wait until you 're gone . 
   whether true or not i do n't know , [ snopes , i choose you !, 
   i certainly do n't mean to be an ass . 
  yeah , i know . 
  you 're trying to get rid of the gut feelings and guesses and cut straight to the point instead , right ? 
  after all , why guess if you can work with facts ? 
  i get that . 
  i was n't trying to criticize you or anything , i think i just recognized myself in you for a moment and figured that if you * are * like me , you should know what it looks like from the outside and that you 'd appreciate directness more than pussyfooting around . 
  sorry to butt in like this , but you 're coming off as a bit of an ass . 
  he 's not making a concrete truth claim , he 's positing a possibility that is there to be discussed . 
   my god damn phone only has the '' \u2030 '' icon . 
  your phone has the promille , but not the percent icon [ ? 
  ] ( http://phraseturner.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/rachels-wtf-face.jpg ) how did that happen ? 
   here the first female councillor of the political reformed party ( sgp ) was elected . 
  hahaha . 
  oh , that is delicious . 
  i mean , i wish the sgp would not get any seats at all , crazy mofos that they are , but if they * have * to have a seat , there would be no bigger justice than it being a woman . 
  thank you , flushing , for kicking the sgp in their bollocks . 
   they have been described as `` grasshoppers '' by one conservative mp . 
  grasshoppers ... could that be better translated as `` locusts '' , with all the implications it has ? 
  at least it has enough calories . 
   whether you are for or against this mesure its not a reason to disthonestly twist definitions . 
  assuming you are correct , he might just be mistaken and not dishonestly twisting definitions ... 
  are you sure ? 
  william of orange wrested control from the spanish in the eighty years war , right ? 
  i think england and the then-united provinces were on the same side in that war . 
  edit : oh wait , you mean william iii . 
  gods , the english and the dutch navy just kept making stories . 
  nothing as funny as the kettle war , but still !, 
  i. . . what ? 
  okay ... ? 
  russia is nazi now . 
   also , ooh , burn from dutchie to a native anglais . 
  we shall conquer you yet , england . 
  ^ ( also , i think you mean ` one * and * the same ' ), 
  `` no , * you * are a stupid asshole ! '', 
  `` no , * you * are an idiot ! '', 
  wonderful arguments in this thread . 
   that 's not the kind of content i get in the reddits i 'm subscribed to . 
  because the community is more important than the voting system . 
  me neither , but that 's because i toss out the subreddits where that has already happened . 
  subreddits have their own version of eternal september like that . 
  the community is to the voting system what a diyer is to a toolbox . 
  if the toolbox contains only a hammer , you 're gon na get sloppy work , no matter how proficient at diy someone is .
