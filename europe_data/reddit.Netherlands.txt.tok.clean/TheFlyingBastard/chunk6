   why do n't we see the same kind of analysis for reddit ? 
  that would be far more constructive than saying that the `` system is fundamentally broken '' without an analysis or an alternative . 
  i 've already given an alternative . 
  you also might want to check out subreddits such as / r/theoryofreddit , particularly discussions such as [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/1jc7uj/does_our_karma_system_discourage_free_expression/ ) , [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/12e27c/why_is_the_voting_system_not_working_on_rsandy/ ) , [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/1sa3fv/an_analysis_of_reddit_and_its_filter_bubbles/ ) , and [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/vsxhi/it_was_suggested_that_this_be_posted_in/c57gwfu ) ( the last actually suggesting the same thing i said before ) . 
  but outside of tor there is also a ton of [ discussion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/c56x55f ) and [ analysis ] ( http://amix.dk/blog/post/19588 ) about the effects of the voting system on reddit . 
  people do n't just say this to be contrarian . 
  the system `` functions '' , sure , but so does the first past the post election system . 
  it functions poorly if you want content other than [ karmawhoring ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jwmavzl.png ) and [ circlejerks ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1zjx0n/atheist_superheroes_save_the_day/ ) and [ low-effort posting ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/all/ ) , because that 's exactly what this system does . 
  which is what i already said , but far be it from me to analyze and elaborate . 
  it 's better to just say `` everybody loves it , i do n't know why so many people are complaining ! '', 
  because at least * that * is n't `` incompetent reasoning '' , is it ? 
  that 's quite the non-sequitur . 
  just because it is n't fundamentally broken does n't make the site worthless , nor does the relative lack of complaints say anything about how well it functions . 
  in fact , you have completely omitted my elaboration . 
  why not respond to the meat of the argument rather than quote mine me as if i 'm making a bald assertion ? 
  what 's more , in a way your reply is a self-fulfilling prophecy : if people who do n't like the voting system just leave , the only people who will be left are those who are happy with it . 
  that 's a good suggestion , but i 'm afraid more than that needs to change . 
  the voting system on reddit is fundamentally broken and only serves to create circlejerks . 
  i know other websites such as slashsdot use a system where you can tag a comment as `` insightful '' , `` informative '' , `` interesting '' and `` funny '' . 
  perhaps a system like that would be more conductive to discussions . 
   why is it entirely acceptable for alcoholic beverages but you think it strange when applied to cheese ? 
  i never made that distinction . 
  same product , same name . 
  different product , different name . 
  but apparently the cheeses * are * different , and the disputed cheeses * are * just knockoffs so it 's a moot point . 
  makes sense , do n't want to get confused with cheap knockoffs that are n't as good as the original . 
  different product , different name . 
   ironically , gouda is not a protected name !, 
  anyone can call their cheese gouda whether it 's produced in the netherlands or not . 
  haha . 
  of course it is n't . 
  well bum 's on me . 
   defenders of the aoc system -- myself included -- would argue that certain products like cigars , wine , and cheese can only come from certain places because of the way they 're grown and how much they depend on local soil , livestock , and climactic conditions . 
  that i can not disagree with . 
  if the cheese is different because of the way it is prepared , then naming the knockoff the same is just false advertising . 
  hurray for aoc . 
  i see what you mean and i 'd hate for war to happen * anywhere * . 
  but in the end , what good does `` letting go '' do ? 
  at what point does `` letting go '' become `` letting them get away with it '' ? 
   for a product to have an aoc it needs to meet stringent criteria sorry , a what ? 
   and yes , if you 've ever had the pasteurized , industrially-produced versions of `` camembert '' or `` gorgonzola '' that are sold in north america , you 'd taste the difference immediately . 
  in that case , fair enough . 
  name it something different . 
  i 'm just saying - if france makes the same gouda cheese as we do , they can call it gouda for all i care . 
  what matters to me is practicality . 
   i do n't think you have much of an idea why the the dollar is the reserve currency please correct me if i 'm wrong , but did n't that have something to do with america playing their cards right , just when europe had recently finished with two world wars , or something ? 
  i seem to recall something like that ... 
  `` putincoins '' , the latest and greatest digital currency occupying your internets . 
  are the cheeses really that different that they need to get a different name ? 
  because it sounds kinda silly to me that nobody can use a certain common name * just * because in the past it was used to signify where it came from . 
  same product , same name , right ? 
  oh , i agree . 
  but if american soldiers are stationed there anyway , presumably to protect their interests as is the premise of op , might as well take it personally , right ? 
  what else are they there for but to look after themselves and their allies ? 
  really , i would go a bit further than your first question : why would the american military be that large * at all * ? 
  might as well put that ridiculously large army to use , right ? 
   i very much support us troops in germany , they bring in a lot of money oh , germany . 
  `` more troops , they are good for our economy ! '', 
  you guys are so economically practical , you might as well be dutch . 
  i 'd like to have * all * allies , actually . 
  i 'll especially have some british sas , please . 
  those guys know their shit . 
  well , there 's this thing about the whole the hague invasion act that just does n't sit quite comfortable . 
  the us is kind of ... looming . 
  ten reasons science has gone too far ** read more **, 
  so less of a queen , more of a pawn ? 
  how can denmark not come out on top there ? 
  they have such cool laws that make unhealthy food expensive and healthy food so available . 
  also ...  although its authenticity could not be confirmed ... quality news , this . 
  i 'm a terrible politician , and perhaps it 's just my confirmation bias , but there seems to be a pattern that i notice ... small , lean governmental organizations without endless bureaucracies are generally less profitable but more effective . 
  sometimes it just seems that governments - large as they are - have become businesses who stopped caring about the people they are supposed to represent and are spending more time on lobbyists of commercial ventures than the people they are supposed to take care of . 
  maybe i 'm just misinformed and cynical , though . 
   the things you see on reddit are very critical of the us . 
  it would be akin to me assuming dutch politics revolved around geert wilders and him enraging other eu governments to the point they dont allow him entry into their countries . 
  which is why i do n't use reddit as a news source . 
  trying to avoid circlejerks and all that . 
  ;-) the science going on there does have me drool , though . 
  on the other hand , the whole battle over biology textbooks is * still * not resolved ... 
  you make some good points and provide plenty support . 
  thanks for sharing that with me , especially the last part , about the different `` levels '' of goverment . 
  what 's the story between left-wing and right-wing here ? 
  i 'll edit my initial comment then , thanks for the feedback . 
  :-)  i would rather not launch into a debate about the health of the political system right now , and you are certainly entitled to your own opinion . 
  i was kind of hoping you would share your opinion . 
  i like to hear the other side of the story , gives me some more balance , shows me those gray areas in life . 
  i mean , do n't feel pressured , but if you know something i do n't , i 'd be happy to hear it . 
  your non-argument has been noted . 
  too bad you had to resort to committing a genetic fallacy rather than actually saying something of value . 
  i 'm sure , i 'm not talking about the people though . 
  you have pockets of something everywhere . 
  i 'm talking about the way that , among other things , the first-past-the-post system made that best laid plan , by people who genuinely gave a shit , go so awry in the end . 
  more choice and voices would help , methinks . 
  i did not say it was a terrible place to live at all . 
  i have no reason to comment on that . 
  ( as you said . ), 
  i said it has a terrible government , one that americans do not deserve . 
  i just find it a bit bitter that the founding fathers came to that wonderful new land , ready to start anew , with a government for the people , by the people - even starting their constitution in large letters : `` we the people '' - and then they end up like that , with a government that is so far away from them . 
  personal experiences with what ? 
  the smear campaigns between political candidates ? 
  the partisan rhetoric from the most watched news stations in america ?
