  i 'm in regular contact with a guy now who is raised in a fundamentalist christian cult . 
  he 's also gay and has to watch what he says in public lest he loses his family and friends . 
  it 's only online where he can truly find himself , where he has the freedom to express his opinion without his life being tossed upside down . 
  nevertheless , our intelligence services are behaving disgracefully , working together with the gchq to find loopholes in dutch law to exploit so they can do mass tapping too . 
  also , buying a server park while pushing for a law that allows them to make good use of said server park . 
  i am actually surprised that denmark did n't score any higher . 
  those guys stimulate healthy eating every which way . 
  agreed . 
  the front of the old guilders used to be quite nice . 
  a crown on top of a shield with a lion rampant would n't be too terrible for the back of the dutch euro . 
  sorry , but i think you meant to refer to [ this page ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/freakyfridayflip ) . 
  i do n't `` keep repeating it '' , ( wo ) man . 
  i said that i just recalled something and that i was n't sure if i was correct . 
  i 'm glad that you came along and corrected me . 
  seriously , i do thank you for that because i want to get as much shit right as possible . 
   i did n't mean to single you out but i 'm so sick of reddit straight up lying about this thing ( either unintentionally or otherwise ) that when i got to your post i could n't just pass it over again . 
  i totally get that . 
  misconceptions are the most devious kind of incorrect information . 
  i just felt that with that treatment , if i get blamed for it anyway , i might as well have * not * said i was n't sure . 
   people like you need to stop repeating it when you clearly do n't understand the situation at all . 
  i appreciate you setting the record straight , but damn , who shat in your custard ? 
  `` people like me '' expressedly say ` if i recall correctly ' , meaning i do n't know if i 'm right . 
  that 's quite an important part of the message ; why would you ignore that ? 
  they * have * to make a choice , as far as i know . 
  mind you , as i said , i am just speaking from memory . 
  do n't be surprised if i get it wrong in places . 
  yes , it is an opt-out filter . 
  if i recall correctly , new customers have to opt-out . 
  existing customers have to call customer service to get it removed . 
  it 's not orchids , apparently just `` lan '' , an approximation of `` land '' .

  good catch , i meant to say `` non-americans '' . 
  absolutely right . 
  i messed up that translation , thanks . 
   netherlands - de molen hel & verdoemenis , 99.89 `` the mill - hell & ~ ~ doom ~ ~ damnation '' i 'm not sure what that says about our best beer . 
  unsurprising , as the us has a '' [ constitution-free zone ] ( https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/fact-sheet-us-constitution-free-zone ) '' already . 
  i guess that counts for non - ~ ~ europeans ~ ~ americans now , too . 
  i bet a lot of french are upset at that dexter 's lab episode ... `` cheese has never owned * any * omelette , dammit ! '', 
  yeah , hence `` i guess it 's just another thing we share '' . 
  i do n't think he was blaming the us ; he said we were ( at least intelligence-wise ) sattelite states of the us ... and that seems accurate . 
  precedents were set and our governments happily followed . 
  the assholes . 
  of all the countries , i hoped you would be better . 
  i guess it 's just another thing we share ... 
  every time i see one of these articles , it makes me smile . 
  all these politicians up in arms at one another . 
  `` we demand answers ! '', 
  i hope the boiling point is reached very soon . 
  that man 's handwriting is a shitty as his politics . 
  i know , i just find the sudden downvotes funny enough to point out . 
  that was more than mere karmadecay . 
  oh gods , i can only be amazed . 
  imagine if you were someone who had no idea catalonia had this kind of tradition . 
  kind of reminds me of one of those star trek episode where kirk finds a town that is all nice and smiles , but at a certain point on the day everyone just goes insane and starts fighting . 
  the next morning everyone is happy like nothing happens . 
  ** baby angel jesus who sometimes even is a blonde girl ** : 17 karma . 
  ** \\* hot blonde girl ** : 6 karma ** \\* baby ** : 3 karma ** \\* preteen ** : -1 karma well , that did n't go over well . 
  i did n't know you have sinterklaas !, 
  any differences you know of with the dutch sinterklaas ? 
  that translation would be misleading as we already have a word for christ : ` christus ' . 
  since ` kerst ' is only shorthand for ` kerstmis ' or ` kerstdag ' , i 'd say that christmas man is as proper a translation as you 're going to get . 
  i 'm a licensed labworker , so that 's kinda scientific and i 'm studying to be a programmer , which means i tick two of your boxes there ... but still , to me it only makes the most sense . 
  when we increase a value by one , we always increase the last number if possible - why not dates ? 
  and we still need to talk about the ridiculous order our language names its numbers , too !, 
  get your shit together , dutch . 
  right . 
  as in the english word `` poland '' , except without the `` nd '' . 
  we also write the euro symbol before the amount . 
  we always have , even in the age of the guilder : \u019210 , -, 
   poola is kinda cute \\ ^_^ poola-chaaaaan ~ !, 
   you might think of some kind of esperanto-esque language , but then nobody would learn that . 
  if it 's mandatory , why not ? 
  it 's not a difficult language , plus people will learn other language much easier . 
  `` straight at his turnip '' . 
  there , i 'm sure we have broken down any remaining language barriers now . 
  i love flemish . 
  dutch has some harsher sounds , kinda like a dejected german . 
  flemish , however , is very smooth , comparatively . 
   what do you do when you 've had your 4th kid ? 
  get a vasectomy ? 
  why ... ? 
  i mean ... why * that * sentence ? 
  there are no lions here and carrots are n't particularly interesting to us . 
  why not ... `` the fish is in the water '' or something like that . 
  teaches you useful words too . 
  ... the hell ? 
  `` oh no , some guys on the internet said something bad about us . 
  let 's fine them '' ? 
  who thought up that shit ? 
  ... yeah , that 's a good point , actually . 
   http://www.thisnation.com/question/042.html   this is what i found on the topic . 
  well , that 's depressing ... time for a revolution !, 
   the us needs a reform on this , and arguably , so does the uk . 
  however , the uk rejected this in a referendum ... so , there 's that ... thing is , most of these votes came from people who already voted conservative , who * love * to see the conservatives in power every time . 
  i honestly ca n't think of any other reason to keep it like that than because your preferred party stands to gain from it . 
  there 's really no honesty in such votes . 
  just let every vote count and give out seats according to the amount of votes . 
  how is that such a terrible concept ? 
   the lack of alternative voting yeah , that 's kind of what i 'm asking . 
  there * are * independents , but they just never get a word in edgewise because nobody votes for them .
