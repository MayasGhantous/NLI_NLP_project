please note : more than 80 % of greeks here want the eur and to be in the eurozone . 
  [ i do n't think this is true . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/greece/comments/3c5st2/the_truth_about_greece_syrizas_creatively/csshrlz )  the media has systematically ignored and buried coverage of polls conducted within greece by reputable non-greek firms such as gallup international , whose pan-european end-of-year survey in december found that 52 % of respondents in greece favor a return to a domestic currency , or bridging europe , whose march 2015 poll in greece similarly found a 53 % majority in favor of leaving the euro , and whose most recent poll found that 63 % of greeks are not afraid of grexit . 
   our correspondent helena smith has learned that sources close to the eu commission in brussels are estimating that the no vote could be ahead by 8 -10 points [ 1 ] beautiful . 
  i do n't think anyone who had more than 100,000 euro on a greek bank would still have it there by now . 
  attention dumbass redditors , for the 2312323th time : ### do n't downvote people just because you disagree with them, 
  that was awesome . 
   starting a business in greece today is like a form of self-torture . 
  there is way more bureaucracy than needs to be . 
  [ then how do you explain this  ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/02/26/the-reason-austerity-in-greece-didnt-work/ )  `` finally , the size of companies in greece is a fundamental structural issue . 
  industrial capitalism was never strong in greece , which is a society of small owners and of microbusinesses . 
  land and homes belong mostly to their occupants , free of mortgage , more so than in any western country . 
  self-employment and companies of fewer than 10 employees are much more prevalent than in any other european nation . 
  only 5 percent of employment in the whole economy occurs in companies with more than 250 employees . 
  even the main export industry , tourism , consists mostly of medium and small businesses . '', 
  beautiful . 
   simple question ... are you willing to give them money to keep spending what they do n't have ? 
   it 's very fucking simple ... someone has to pay for it ... who ? 
  you or the greeks ? 
  do you want to pay ? 
  we 're a european community now , right ? 
  if greece falls apart , we 're all going to pay for it one way or another . 
  greece may exit the eu , becoming buddies with russia and china . 
  if greece stays in the eu and we force budget cuts on them , greek immigrants will move to other eu nations , as half of the population is unemployed . 
  all i 'm suggesting is that greece should be allowed to default on its debt . 
  we 've profited enough from the crisis in greece as it is . 
  they do n't need to cut down spending . 
  if they cut down government spending , gdp goes down , which means that debt as a percentage of gdp goes up . 
  programs aimed at helping the poor tend to have a large multiplier , which means that deficit spending actually reduces the debt to gdp ratio . 
   are you going to pay for it ? 
  than who ? 
  they don + t make enough money to pay for it ... so , if they want to keep it , someone else has to pay for it . 
  who ? 
  you ? 
  how much will you give ? 
  greece needs to be allowed to default on its debt . 
   but a report is not a position , and the imf position is `` no debt relief without reform '' . 
  and with `` reforms '' they mean `` cut through the last few hanging threads of what once constituted a social safety net '' . 
   you really have to wonder why the torika are insisting on measures that they know are impossible . 
  i suspect they 're trying to screw syriza to show people what happens when you vote for the `` wrong '' party and that if tsipras loses the referendum and gets kicked out , debt relief will magically appear on the table and the new government will get praised for its `` reasonableness '' and `` professionalism '' . 
  burying european democracy in the place where it was born . 
  well , that 's a possible explanation , but you also have to wonder why the troika insisted on austerity policies that crashed greek gdp by 25 % before syriza even got into power . 
  my suspicion : [ greece is a sacrificial lamb . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/profiting-from-pain-europe-s-crisis-is-germany-s-blessing-a-808248.html ), 
  can you hear that ? 
  i think there 's a storm coming ... 
  so , looks like the majority of greeks are planning on voting no . 
  44 % no vs 13 % yes . 
  though , this survey also has 34 % of people vote syriza , does n't look very representative . 
   the point i 'm making is that greece has huge social iniquities that ca n't be blamed on fellow eu members . 
  [ the troika forced the greeks to reduce their minimum wage by 20 percent . 
  ] ( http://www.socialeurope.eu/2012/02/why-the-troika-is-imposing-a-cut-on-minimum-wages-in-greece/ ) [ when they want to raise corporate taxes , the eurozone says no  ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/divisions-remain-as-eurozone-finance-ministers-meet-over-greece-deal-1435140056 )  for instance , greece had planned to increase corporate taxes to 29 % . 
  but in notes in the document , creditors limited the increase to 28 % . 
  creditors also do n't appear to accept greece 's proposal to introduce a one-off corporate tax of 12 % on companies whose profit exceeds $ 500,000 . 
  these may cause new budget shortfalls that need to be plugged with other measures . 
  gee , surprise surprise , the poor become poorer when you lower the minimum wage and raise the vat and sin taxes . 
  who could 've seen that one coming ? 
   we 're still a collection of sovereign states which are supposed to manage their own finances . 
  if the governments of greece have failed in that task over the years , why is the rest of europe the bad guy for not donating money to fix those failures ? 
  because the rest of europe has forced austerity policies onto the greeks that have destroyed their nation . 
  this sounds like the kind of assumption based on economic theory rather than on any sort of physical conditions . 
  there is no system implemented anywhere there that comes even close to what you 're suggesting . 
  solar energy functions everywhere in the context of a fossil fuel based electricity grid that 's tasked with shouldering the cost of solar panels . 
  just because an electrical grid functions with 1 % of electricity supplied by solar panels year-round does n't mean it will function with 10 % or 100 % . 
  costs are passed on to consumers , prices rise , factories move off-shore , power companies are bankrupted because they have to pay consumers for electricity from the solar panels and forced to operate their power plants at less than full capacity . 
  look up the german solar figures . 
  installed yearly capacity has dropped to a fraction of its peak a few years earlier . 
  yeah , that image assumes that you will save energy year-round , thus it takes the average energy production throughout the year . 
  in reality , i do n't think you will save energy produced in june and use it to heat your house in february next year . 
  in february , energy production from solar is lowest . 
  i did the calculation for the netherlands . 
  if you want to produce all energy used in february with 20 % efficient solar panels , you 'd need to completely cover more than half the country 's surface with solar panels . 
  that does n't include whatever space you 'll need to keep between different solar panels , it 's purely the space occupied by the panels themselves . 
  does n't seem very realistic to me personally . 
  there is no sun at night . 
   what about fracking ? 
  that 's economically non-viable , due to geological differences .

  european union has always been a pet project of our continent 's upper classes . 
  they 're the only ones who are shocked by its death . 
  the european union is a project of neoliberalism . 
  you can look at every aspect of the european project and see that it only benefits a culturally rootless capital-owning upper class at the cost of the continent 's poorest citizens . 
  free labor and migration , so that eastern european truck drivers can work for a fraction of the wages of western european drivers , who end up fired . 
  free migration encourages welfare fraud in foreign countries , which means that the social safety net ends up dismantled , as its abuse makes it unsustainable . 
  generous farm subsidies , so that large land owners can milk the government , ensuring that the land remains in the hands of a small group of people . 
  currency union ensures that governments are not allowed to engage in deficit spending , thereby promoting neoliberal economic policies . 
  free trade , so that corporations can set up shop in the nation with the lowest tax rates ( ireland , luxembourg , netherlands ) , while [ poor countries like greece see their tax revenue lost .

  you 're not allowed to see what 's in ttip . 
  in greece , [ papandreous was forced out of office under german and french pressure ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/03/papandreou-scraps-greek-referendum-euro ) , because he suggested that the greek people should have a voice in the negotations through a referendum . 
  god forbid the people have a say in their own future , that 's obviously best left up to technocrats in brussels to decide , whose failed policies have caused greece to lose a quarter of its gdp and left the nation in shambles !, 
  i 'll be glad when the whole thing implodes . 
   you know that our reserves are not depleting that fast . 
  [ here is the uk .

  the netherlands will soon follow , we 're about halfway through our reserves, 
  and the dutch way is to [ borrow thousands of euros extra when buying a house ] ( http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/householddebtselectedcountries.jpg ) , then using that money for your living expenses , convinced that the value of a house is going to continue rising forever , simply by virtue of banks being willing to lend increasingly large sums of money to young people . 
  the dutch way is also of course to keep corporate taxes ridiculously low , to serve as a tax shelter , so that companies operating in greece do n't pay taxes to the greek government , but rather , [ pay their taxes to the dutch government , despite doing no actual business here ] ( http://www.thepressproject.net/article/75130/crisis-ridden-greece-hit-by-tax-avoidance-through-the-netherlands ) every country has its own problems . 
  when things go wrong , it 's very easy to point fingers afterwards and declare `` this is all your own fault because you did this and that '' .
