grew up in rotterdam where everything is new ( most is max 70 year old , since it got bombed to shit in ww2 ) . 
  during trips to other cities that have n't been bombed just seeing old buildings was awesome . 
  i see another traveler of the x-universe here , 
   deltawerken and two and [ three ] ( https://beeldbank.rws.nl/photos/2298/344710.jpg ) , the maeslantkering which is one of the largest moving structures in the world . 
  enclosing dike since it enclosed the zuiderzee , which is now the ijsselmeer and flevoland . 
  just like warsaw , rotterdam also got bombed to shit in ww2 . 
  resulting in a way more modern architecture than the cities that survived . 
   it 's always fun again to have that bicycles/football fight with them . 
  speaking of bicycles ... 
  favourite : north sea least favourite : the area with all the confused dutch and french people . 
   the tradition of not crowning the monarch dates from 1815  ( ... )  that kingdom included modern-day belgium , and while the belgians were catholics , the dutch were protestants , raising the `` problem of who would put the crown on the king 's head ''  ( ... )  leaving the crown to one side also helped dodge the question of whether the king 's sovereignty came from the people , or from god . 
   ( ... )  even if willem-alexander wanted to wear it , there might be a problem because it was made for an unusually large head , says dutch journalist perro de jong . 
   the crown is 23.5 cm ( 9.2 in ) high and , at the widest part , 31cm ( 12.2 in ) in diameter . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22353152 ** tl ; dr ** politics and size . 
  never seen that one or ca n't remember . 
  got a link for it ? 
  do n't accidentally call us germans . 
  http://www.politicalcompass.org/printablegraph?ec=-6.75&amp;soc=-5.51 i 'm a more extreme ghandi ? 
  pp is n't really a one-issue party , you should read their programme it makes a lot of sense for a modern democracy ( to me ) . 
  even if you look at them as a one-issue party , internet and the digital world plays a very very huge part in your life . 
  seems like a good issue to be one-issue about . 
  so you do n't vote for a party you support because they wo n't get media attention ? 
  because your one single vote would make a lot of difference for the bigger parties ? 
  geenstijl exitpoll has 1.1 % , 
  okay , true that idea does n't really work . 
  but local government handles local issues , national government handles national issues . 
  but if a european government handles european issues , why should it be hindered by national government when the issues transcends nations . 
  but still we got this `` european citizen '' thing going on , evermore international cooperation within the eu and the idea that ep should represent every european citizen . 
  so if a candidate from a different country represents my ideas better , why ca n't i vote for him . 
  if its just like national elections why wo n't we just have no elections at all and just let send the ministers of the national parliament . 
  if ep is voted per nation why wo n't a national election be representative ? 
  we 've got the benelux going quite succesfully for a while ( `` union '' of belgium , netherlands and luxembourg ) . 
  on a side note : previous attempts to unite france and germany did n't work out so well , 
  same for me . 
  looking at the comments , this map is n't just wrong for the netherlands though . 
  rotte does n't mean water , but a river . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotte_%28river%29 not sure where the `` borrowing '' would come from though . 
  subscribe to / r/roadcam or / r/anormaldayinrussia and see for yourself , 
  countries can veto sanctions on themselves ? 
  woh ... that 's a . . perfect system . 
  ah , thought he was talking about within the un . 
  yeah , within the eu there should n't be veto rights . 
  if the countries in eu give up their power of veto , only russia , china and us will have veto rights and eu will have even less power/influence . 
  i would support your idea , if the power of veto is then transferred to the eu . 
  if only the world would have some balls and actually stand up to usa . 
  at least take their power of veto in un , but of course nothing of any importance will happen . 
  i like it . 
  when you give it a relative value , you should place them in order most to least and have the eu average in there as well . 
  eventually , but ` protecting itself ' to me sounds as if europe is under direct attack . 
   the french-led military intervention in mali has once again shown that when it comes to protecting ** itself ** , the eu is only capable of showing `` solidarity from behind '' - according to a french mep . 
  oh i 'm sorry , i forgot that mali was part of europe ... stupid me . 
  do n't you mean kaaskop ... kees is just a dutch name . 
   the northern countries and the netherlands are you saying netherlands can not into nordic : c, 
  sound angrier , make sounds like you are throwing up and you 're speaking dutch . 
  never seen that one before , but it 's amazing . 
  oh god what is that ?!, 
  he said accent , not dialect . 
  not sure if joking , but go around means you just take off again , and circle around the airport for another try . 
  useless ? 
  there is way more cooperation within the benelux than there is within eu ( imo , no sources ) . 
  oh shit yea , been playing ck2 way too much lately so do n't know the details for eu4 anymore , 
  oh man those events are always the dead of my diplomatic power stockpiles . 
  the netherlands is way smaller and even here the official news ( nos ) shows the weather for at least 5 places . 
  seems so ... rough and out of place to have just 2 temperatures in a country as big as germany . 
  the skit translates to `` thursday i bought five pounds of sweet apples here , they were rotten . '', 
  - `` it happens ... 
  i will give you a pot of fresh honey instead '' so he does n't actually say rotten apples , but i agree it sounds way more scandinavian . 
  anno 1500 is surprisingly similar to current dutch . 
  [ a vid with old dutch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfejryn7r3g ) the scene shows a dude who bought 5 pounds of apples , who were rotten . 
  she does not have apples to give him instead he gives him a pot of fresh honey . 
  the european history however shows the dutch being conquered by the spanish , later fucked by france and ultimately by the germans . 
  the european history is just that that is hindering federalization . 
  usa could do it because they had less of a divided background . 
  i do n't think education has no role in it . 
  but history formed our nation 's identity and hinders forming a european one . 
  i think the way of forming it is by showing it . 
  euro may have a negative connotation because the crisis , but i am sure people do n't mind nit having to change currency when they go abroad . 
  we cdrtainly dont mind the schengen agreement . 
  we see nato as a good thing , so why should we view a european army as a bad thing ? 
  start regional like the dutch/german regiment . 
  or how the benelux cooperates . 
  the afsluitdijk is the dyke with which we beat a sea into submission and made it a lake . 
   please allah let this be . 
  if those pesky groningers would stop living there already we could make some real money right . 
  not oil , but eh . 
  it 's something, 
  now all the uninterested people vote with knee-jerk reactions and we end up with impossible splinterparties for everything ... 
  yeah or actually believe that spending money on armed forces is wasted money . 
  it was pretty popular and discussed by politicians . 
  i do n't mind ... liberating the oppressed dutch minority in flanders . 
  edit : i see i 'm not flaired up anymore , if it 's not clear : dutch, 
  polan stronk, 
  quite literally / r/birdsbeingdicks /, 
  hope daddy christmas does n't bring his ti\u00f3 de nadal, 
  obligatory [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://what-if.xkcd.com/53/ ), 
  nowadays whenever we ( dutch ) send soldiers of any kind , we bring our own air assets as well . 
  and when during the battle of chora ( post 9/11 ) the isaf command did n't respond to requests for air support ( once again ... ) the commander threatened to pull the dutch fighters from nato command under dutch command . 
  wow !, 
  wow !, 
  what a save !,
