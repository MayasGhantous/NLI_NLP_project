  probably shitty accent , since they taught themselves , not in school , but they speak it . 
  interestingly , the people that move to the uk from other eu countries to work , bring productivity and taxes to the uk , money which is mostly , if not all , spent in the uk as well . 
  the uk should be happy with this , since studies have shown that the uk net profits from this . 
  while the pensioners going to spain are actually costing the uk a lot of money through missed tax revenue , yet noone complains about that . 
  obviously , in both cases , it 's eu citizens enjoying their freedoms , which the whining little shits in uk politics should shut up about , but i find it interesting that they 're complaining about the wrong thing . 
  it almost seems as if they do n't care what 's actually good for society , but just want to bank on xenophobia to get more votes . 
  that does n't make it ok . hypothetically , if a brit got pissed on in a pub , and would find the offender explaining : `` but in poland , it 's * normal * to piss on someone else 's leg in a pub , everybody does it there ; '' would the brit then accept that explanation and be delighted at the cultural exchange ? 
  or would he punch the guy in the face and spend several weeks complaining about how those goddamn polish immigrants are ruining the pubs ? 
  speaking of size , we are the tallest people * of the world !, 
  * a land of giants and giantesses , that has to count for something , right ? 
  even if / r/europe does n't find us noteworthy , i know / r/tall likes us . 
  that is assuming you only spend time with upper-class brits . 
  spend a saturday night in a bar in birmingham with a bunch of chavs and a lot of your illusions will be shattered . 
  then again , you forgot one huge redeeming feature : indian food . 
  they 're not mutually exclusive . 
  interesting , thanks for the explanation . 
  does n't that suggest then that `` laid off '' makes more sense in the title ? 
  are you saying you think germany would be better off financially without the euro ? 
  are you sure it is n't ( partly ) nostalgia towards the deutschmark ? 
  if `` torture '' was an acceptable outcome for the crime of preaching hatred , then `` torture '' would have been on the books in the uk as a punishment for the crime of `` hate speech . '', 
  there 's a good reason that it is n't . 
  and if the uk thinks that that punishment is wrong , they should feel that it is * always * wrong , not just when it 's in their own back yard . 
  thank you for clarifying your point so eloquently . 
  the underlying reasoning you have given have surely done much to persuade many a reader on this here sub . 
  it helps to be a tad more descriptive than just `` conservative '' . 
  i associate the word with the american republican party , whose policies and preferences would be considered outrageous if they were carried in a european country . 
  for example , unlike the american republicans , the csu is * not * trying to put the power to decide over healthcare in the hands of private insurance companies , even if it drives up healthcare cost 100 % or more , leaves millions of people uninsured and thus causes preventable deaths from lack of healthcare . 
  the american republicans are fine with that . 
  the csu would n't be ok with `` the world was created by an unspecified intelligent being , since look at how everything fits together so well '' being taught as just as credible as actual science . 
  nor would they be with sex education in high schools being abstinence-only . 
  no information whatsoever about how biology works , what contraceptives are available , none . 
  just do n't have sex until you 're married and you 'll be fine . 
  i 'm making assumptions , of course , since the [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_social_union_in_bavaria ) page on the csu barely has * any * information about their actual policies , but since they 're post-ww2 , they 're probably not retarded ( german politicians have been more level-headed than the european average , in my experience ) and if they 're anything like the dutch cda , with whom they 're in the european political party called [ epp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people%27s_party ) then my assumptions would most likely be right . 
  if your preferred party is fiscally conservative ( right-of-center ) then on that point they 're similar to what i voted for second-to-last election ( last election , i voted for the pirate party ) but if they 're * socially * conservative as well , then they 're not up my ally . 
  the cda , for example , is more socially conservative , but frankly , that 's simply because they 're christian . 
  the cda wants to keep stores closed on sundays , not because they 're conservative in the sense that they want to keep traditions , but because of their religion . 
  they want to keep abortions and euthanasia as illegal as possible . 
  not because it used to be that way in the past , but again , because of their religion . 
  they generally oppose policies that close the gender gap and help women more easily perform well in the job market , because they prefer women to marry and stay at home with the kids . 
  that probably is conservative , not just because of religion . 
  i hope that last paragraph does n't come off as snarky . 
  i disagree with their ( the cda 's ) socially conservative agenda because it hinders me personally and because i think it counters my ideal of personal freedom . 
  i love to be able to do shopping on a sunday , for example . 
  but i understand their reasoning and i respect it . 
  and i have no problem having a reasonable and respectful argument with a cda member about how the social agenda of the netherlands ( or the eu ) should be handled . 
  and there is the problem with populist parties . 
  if you look at the underlying reasons of their social policies , you run into fear , racism and other bad emotions . 
  the ukip , for example , claim horrible things about polish workers in the uk , even when studies have shown that they have provided the country with significantly more wealth than they have cost the uk . 
  that makes it very difficult to have a discussion about which policy is right , when they are either based on gut emotions , or blatant misinformation/lies . 
  i lost my original train of thought . 
  what i meant to say was simply : can you give us a few hints as to the kind of parties you wanted to talk about ? 
  socially conservative ? 
  christian parties ? 
  do the fiscal policies matter as well , or is it mostly about the social agenda ? 
  it 's difficult to find lots of information about the csu in english . 
  can you give some examples of actual policies/approaches that you do mean then , instead of giving an example of a political party that apparently rubs people the wrong way ? 
  also , `` pro-europe '' and `` fn '' contradict each other , since fn is fiercely anti-eu and anti-europe ( and pro-nationalist french ) , hence the example confusing me . 
  i did n't mean to go `` full offensive mode , '' i just meant to clear up the difference between fn and a `` normal '' political party . 
  if you honestly think fn is a normal party , then read up on them . 
  they are a far-right party . 
  we do n't respect far-right parties nor the people that vote for them . 
  and just because ( in the past ) there existed something worse than * x * , does n't mean that * x * is n't bad . 
  that reasoning makes no sense . 
  besides , * objectively * ( i 'm not calling then nazis in some childish way ) the current fn shares some serious ideas with the nsdap . 
  especially before the nsdap became a hitler-centric cult . 
  such as : nationalism , economic protectionism , being against intra-european cooperation , preying on the ( stupid part of the ) population 's fear of one religion , anti-immigration , especially when concerning `` the darkies '' ( they 're less against immigration when it concerns dutch or english citizens , etc ) , * very * strict policies against crime , welfarist policies to protect the poor people voting for them , etc. 
  also , complete disregard for objective truth in international politics , as long as it fits their narrative . 
  from their [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_front_%28france%29 ) page :  marine le pen described russian president vladimir putin as a `` defender of the christian heritage of european civilisation . 
  '' [ 167 ] the national front considers that ukraine has been subjugated by the united states , through the ukrainian crisis . 
  not only are there some vague similarities , they 've been sympathetic to actual nazis in the past . 
  again , from wikipedia :  in 2005 , jean-marie le pen wrote in the far-right weekly magazine rivarol that the german occupation of france `` was not particularly inhumane , even if there were a few blunders , inevitable in a country of [ 220,000 square miles ] '' and in 1987 referred to the nazi gas chambers as `` a point of detail of the history of the second world war . '', 
  he has repeated the latter claim several times . 
  [ 181 ] also in 2004 , bruno gollnisch said `` i do not question the existence of concentration camps but historians could discuss the number of deaths . 
  as to the existence of gas chambers , it is up to historians to speak their minds '' ( de se d\u00e9terminer ) . 
  [ 182 ] there are plenty of actual american-definition conservatists in europe , and i have voted right-of-center in the past as well when it seemed like the right choice , but parties like fn in france , or the pvv in the netherlands are ** not ** normal political parties , regardless of what label you stick on them . 
  they are parasitic , despicable , populist shitstains on society . 
  that implies that fn is a normal , serious party , but with a different location on the left-right / liberal-conservative spectrum . 
  that 's not the case . 
  fn is a party for people who will vote for people that promise them that they get to keep their own moneys , still get lots of moneys through good health/elderly care , and will try to get rid of all the annoying darkies . 
  that 's not a `` normal '' political party , that 's a populist ( and in this case extreme-right ) party . 
  it 's for good reason that most people think they 're idiots , or at least the people who vote for them . 
  can we please stop using the weird `` redundant '' euphemism ? 
  they are not `` redundant '' in the dictionary sense of the word . 
  it 's just a word the british use when they really mean that someone is unemployed , more specifically when they were fired / let go from their job by their employer . 
  [ ... maaaaaaniac on the floor !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8njbgr2nk2c ) ( and she 's dancing like she 's never danced before ), 
   ofcom also tried to push rt out of britain multiple times due to `` biased coverage '' . 
  ofcom is yet to succeed . 
  ofcom * should * push rt out of britain . 
  it 's blatant propaganda , * pretending to be news * . 
  if a commercial can be banned for grossly misrepresenting its product then a news network that does n't give a shit about truth should be banned as well . 
  it 's not a matter of free speech , it 's a matter of punishing people that use lies and fraud to prey on your citizens . 
  watching it still made me hungry though . 
  the irony and hypocrisy in that video is hurting my brain ... 
   do n't you find this claim to be mutually exclusive ? 
   i mean - collective decisions , compromise etc. 
  are known ways to avoid responsibility . 
  no , they 're ways to * share * responsibility . 
  it 's only avoiding/reducing responsibility if you otherwise would have all/more of it . 
  if you have a strong leader / dictator then that person has all the power and thus responsibility , and the citizen has none .
