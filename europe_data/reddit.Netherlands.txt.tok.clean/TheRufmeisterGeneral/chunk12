  in a perfect democracy , the citizen holds part of the responsibility because a representative is acting out their wishes/ideals . 
  thus , in a democracy , a citizen has * more * responsibility than in a dictator-like situation . 
  i 've heard the term `` populist '' used , maybe that helps clarify it better . 
  how is quoting the conclusion of the article ( literally ) as a post title editorializing ? 
  seriously , are we misunderstanding what reddit ( or the mods ) mean by editorializing ? 
  i did n't get the impression that op inserted his own opinions or misrepresented the article . 
  it just seems logical that the central conclusion of the article summarizes it better than its odd official title : `` 5 questions about the mh17 investigation '', 
  semantics . 
  all three of you are talking about the same thing . 
  it 's fine . 
  everybody knows and understands `` holland '' to be a nickname for the whole country . 
  it 's like the uk and gb . 
  * technically * , northern ireland is part of the uk , but not of the * isle * of great britain . 
  and yet , if someone corrects you during conversation , telling you that `` gb is wrong '' when you 're technically talking about the whole of the uk , they 'll be a pedantic ass , since everybody knew what you were talking about . 
  no , it is n't . 
  it 's like calling people from the us `` americans '' even though `` america '' is a continent . 
  it 's * technically * wrong , but everybody knows what you mean . 
  saying hovedstaden instead of denmark though , * will * cause confusion . 
   holland represents a cultural and historic region . 
  no , it does n't . 
  modern places like amsterdam , the hague and rotterdam share no more common culture with enkhuizen or the westland than they do with nearby cities like utrecht and amersfoort , which * are * part of randstad but not `` holland . '', 
  the exact origins and history of provinces does n't change what meaning the word has today . 
  and although `` cunts '' is a rough word , mainly because i 'm fed up with this lingual fanaticism by limburgers and brabos , you 'll have a hard time finding people in cities like utrecht , apeldoorn , amersfoort , enschede , etc who refer to `` holland '' as the two provinces instead of simply the whole country . 
  most importantly : ** stop confusing english-speaking people !, 
  ** sure , it 's an interesting , mostly historic , little fact for those who are pedantic at heart , but in no circumstance should you tell foreigners that they * should n't use * holland as shorthand or a nickname for the country . 
  it 's not wrong . 
  it * is * the nickname for the whole country . 
  whether you resent city folk from the randstad or not . 
  holland is n't a province in holland . 
  it 's a nickname for the whole country . 
  chants like `` hup holland hup '' are shouted by all dutch in support of the * national * football team , it does n't suddenly go silent east of the amstedam-gouda line . 
  when you 're talking about south-holland or north-holland though , that is specific enough to assume someone is talking about the province , but i 've never heard someone refer to those two provinces as `` holland '' unless it 's some rural cunt who is fiercely of the opinion that his province is better than someone else 's province ( like limburgers . ), 
  yes , they are . 
  that 's literally how nearly every retirement scheme in the world works . 
  let me know when the ukrainian government starts killing jews . 
  in the meantime , shut the fuck up . 
  first , he complains about libya , which was n't a eu action , it was a few separate countries , partly coordinated by nato , then he claims that * someone suggested * that poverty might be a reason for refugee status ( which is nonsense ) , then he speaks of `` countless millions '' which is completely unfounded bullshit , then he takes the word of isis as gospel . 
  let 's not even * joke * about being at war . 
  ** we are not at war !, 
  ** you know who want to bang the drums of war ? 
  the people that want to take your freedoms away , the ones that want you to feel nationalistic pride so you 'll back the nation 's leadership , without criticism . 
  and isis . 
  terrorists want to spread terror . 
  this video tries to spread terror through big words , convoluted messages and a harrowing backing track . 
  farange , the scaremongering populist has more in common with isis than with calm , sensible politicians . 
  hipster . 
  the uk spends the same amount of tax money per capita on their healthcare ( the nhs ) does as the us does . 
  ergo , if magically * poof * the american system was completely replaced with the nhs , without switching costs , etc , you 'd pay zero extra taxes while all healthcare would be free . 
  who is the sucker now ? 
  if you 're going to link to a youtube source , you might as well link the [ live version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obxrjgsd-au&amp;t=92 ) , which features awesome outfits and the legendary dance moves of aruban/dutch bobby farrell . 
  who , rasputin ? 
  plot twist : op is n't accidentally a total screwup , but used [ cunningham 's law ] ( https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/cunningham's_law ) to spark a huge , vibrant discussion on * actual * traditional dress , where lots of people have posted lots of accurate examples . 
  ( for the lazy , cunningham 's law states : `` the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question , it 's to post the wrong answer . '' ), 
  you 're just bitter because you can not into space . 
  well ... that is * technically * correct . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ best ^ ^ ^ ^ kind ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ correct, 
  good to hear it was n't me being misinformed about flag though , hehe . 
  you know , we already have luxembourg imitating our flag . 
  i 'm confused ... that flag from your flair looks more dutch than romanian . 
  did you guys have a flag referendum recently as well ? 
  somehow , i 'm reminded again of [ this short video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdqayc1sr7g&amp;t=81 ) . 
  you are part of the eu . 
  claims that that was more than just two colleagues discussing their views on what 's happening around them , are conspiracy theories . 
  if you had any idea how my colleagues in it and me discuss users , and took that as seriously as you seem to take nuland , you 'd be worried we 're a secretive cult of sociopathic assholes , determined to murder anyone who ever touched a computer without the competence to at least take it apart and reassemble it . 
  but guess what , we 're not . 
  sometimes colleagues talk about stuff they experienced around them and how they wish things were different , and sometimes , people that are not in the room , get verbally shit on . 
  your first comment was correct , i meant the no voters , the `` protest '' voters who did n't give a shit about ukraine , just about annoying the government . 
  any guy that looks at a woman will have at least * part * of his brain involuntarily thinking about ... or wait , maybe i 'm just strange . 
  that is such a silly argument an analogy : every women i 've ever had sex with , i had also shook hands with , well before any potential sex had come up . 
  does that mean that a women i meet somewhere should be offended or worried if i offer to shake her hand because `` that 's the first step on the way to sex '' ? 
  i voted yes , but i regret it . 
  because if a few more of us yes-voters had n't voted at all , they would n't have made the 30 % threshold and then the referendum would have been ignored . 
  a lot of the yes voters had no idea what the association agreement was about , but just did n't like the government , so they told them `` no , '' or did n't like the eu , so they told them `` no , '' or liked the general idea of more direct democracy , so wanted to make it count by saying `` no . '', 
  of all the no-voters i 've talked to over the last few weeks , nobody had anything of merit to say about the actual association agreement itself , except that `` it will lead to them joining '' which is nonsense . 
  indeed . 
  or did n't vote tactically , to prevent the threshold from being met . 
  which was unwise , in retrospect . 
  the exit poll has a 3 % margin of error , so they 're predicting 26 % -32 % , so : too close to call . 
  and yes , 30 % turnout is required to make it valid . 
  plus/minus 3 % accuracy , making it ** too close to call ** . 
  also , your pro/against numbers are in reverse . 
  # turnout : too close to call # majority of voters are against , not in favour . 
  since crimea , the word `` annexation '' sounds pretty evil too . 
  it is , hence the name , just much less useful than most other kinds . 
  however , i do n't see how this is relevant . 
  * very few * people care . 
  only some fanatics that shout very loudly . 
  it would be unfair to uninformed foreigners to suggest it 's something like a 50/50 split in opinion . 
  it is n't . 
  that seems hypocritical . 
  you should give them work permits , so they can make money and pay taxes , that way , they 'd be a net benefit instead . 
  this is n't about influencing a jury , it 's about punishment for a crime someone has n't been proven guilty of , yet . 
  do you not understand that * as a suspect * , having your name and face plastered over websites and newspapers , might do * very * serious harm to someone ? 
  in a modern , civilized society , it makes sense to protect a potentially innocent person ( again , innocent until proven guilty ) from that . 
  in * this particular case * , it seems pointless , because so much information was already publicly being passed around , but that makes it like running a red light at night , when the road is empty . 
  yes , you might get really angry about how pointless it is , and how it impedes on your freedom , but the law is clear , the law exists for a good reason , and it makes sense that you get a fine for breaking it , even if * in this particular case * you 're fairly sure it 's harmless . 
  edit :  until that , too , is censored . 
  it wo n't be , these rules have been around for decades . 
  they made sense back then and still do . 
  nobody wants to `` escalate it '' or whatever it is that you 're suggesting .
