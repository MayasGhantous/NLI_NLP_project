  https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/slippery-slope  it 's not like the lurid details wo n't appear in the press . 
  wait , wait , wait ... are you suggesting that the name and face of the suspect * will * appear in the press ? 
  because they wo n't . 
  press in ( most , afaik ) european countries ** do not ** show full names and faces of suspects in trials . 
  i thought that 's what we were talking about here . 
  he was n't arrested . 
  he was fined . 
  big difference . 
  what i 'm talking about has nothing to do with star chambers . 
  for example , in the netherlands , the * facts of the case * are public ( facts , statements , opinions on them , etc ) , and normally anybody is welcome to go to court and watch for themselves what is going on , including all identities . 
  nothing secret about it . 
  but , ** in the media ** , the suspect 's name ( and picture ) needs to be censored ** until a guilty verdict ** . 
  so , if the guy is guilty , then all we 're talking about is a delay . 
  if the guy is not guilty , then the press has no business ruining his life . 
  and in either case , those wanting to know what happened in court can simply request the official documents , as opposed to looking at the media . 
  it has to do with free speech in that the right to free speech ** conflicts ** with a defendant 's right to not have their life fucked over before he 's proven to be guilty . 
  edit : for context , in the netherlands , the right to privacy is actually [ in the constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_the_netherlands ) , and i 'm glad it is . 
  sometimes , when you want to give * more * rights and freedoms to your citizens than other , less free nations , you need to balance the few places where different rights of different people might clash . 
  edit : wait , you mean * the accused * has the right to a public trial ? 
  well , duh , that works on europe as well . 
  the guy whose name is not being fully disclosed in the media out of a fundamental respect for the guy 's privacy , is * of course * free to mention himself to the press that he 's the one people are talking about . 
  yes , the people who actually give a shit about the notion of `` innocent until proven guilty '' . 
  a person has the right to a fair trial . 
  being innocent until proven guilty is part of that . 
  in many european countries , part of that is the right to not be identified in the media until you 're actually proven guilty in court . 
  how often does it happen in the us , that someone is arrested for a crime , then gets vilified in the media , uproar about what vigilante justice this person deserves , then is acquitted in court ( because they were innocent ) , at which point they do n't get their jobs back , their reputation back , with lots of people still wondering whether they were guilty after all or not ... and it being very , very difficult for that person for many years to find a job , since it 's so easy to google a name and have newspaper articles come up . 
  whose rights are more important ? 
  the free speech rights of the journalist to publish a name * slightly sooner * than otherwise ? 
  ( the name can be published after a guilty verdict ) , or the right of a potentially innocent person to not have their life * completely and utterly fucked over * ? 
  sometimes rights are not absolute yes or nos , on or offs . 
  sometimes different rights need to be balanced . 
  aye , i wondered , where that went . 
  thanks . 
   it costs us 1 billion $ each each ? 
  like per immigrant ? 
  it 's neat that we were mentioned in a movie , with actual americans . 
  like the cinematic masterpiece : [ deuce bigalow : european gigolo ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367652/ ) . 
  on a sidenote : robocop , total recall , speed , starship troopers were made by dutch , as well as of course movie star famke janssen and some others being dutch . 
  i 'm fairly sure the guys from h3h3 productions also have dutch roots . 
  worse , they kept using german words for the amsterdam segment !, 
  those basterds !, 
  the words seem to fit in that germany is more sexually ... ` creative ' ( ` deviant ' makes it sound like a bad thing ) than the netherlands or even amsterdam , is . 
  i 've been told more than once that some people in germany think the nl on our license plates stands for `` nur links '', 
  haha , no worries . 
  you were not the only one to react that way , maybe i phrased my silliness wrong . 
  why would you not have a license plate at the front of your car ? 
  well , of course . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with that . 
  in fact , i 'm not voicing any opinion . 
  i was just mocking the way the powned guy kept repeating that to the point of it sounding silly . 
  oh , i agree with the point being raised , and * obviously * you should never hit journalists , even when they 're this annoying . 
  i was just gently mocking how he kept repeating that one phrase over and over , almost to [ the point where it lost its meaning from being repeated too much ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semantic_satiation ) . 
  do n't feed the trolls , please . 
  is that why the dutch are also not on that list ? 
  no wait , it 's because we 're the best drivers ever !, 
  ( staying in the left lane is n't technically a crime , is it ? ), 
  if you speed enough for a ticket . 
  most states wo n't even ticket you if you go 15 km/h ( or 10mph , in ye olde imperial units ) over the limit . 
  that would be unheard of , here . 
  edit : my experience has been in the midwest , mostly . 
  obviously , in crazy places like la or nyc , it 'll be different . 
  now do us !, 
  edit : wait , that came out wrong ... 
  i meant : what do you call us dutch ? 
   and defend yourself if they became violent that means you can shoot to kill if they ~ ~ are black ~ ~ act menacingly , right ? 
  ^ ^ ^ seriously ^ ^ ^ though , ^ ^ ^ thanks ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ interesting ^ ^ ^ insight, 
  why would a dutch party get `` broken up '' by police ? 
  they might , however , ask you to keep the noise down if you 're being a nuisance to neighbours , but that 's not specific to kids or parties . 
  typical russian tit-for-tat . 
  if the speed limit is `` unreasonably '' low , but other traffic * is * driving that speed ( because they do n't want a fine ) then you 're endangering the other traffic by driving past them with a significant speed differential . 
  there are plenty of roads with speed limits . 
  only * parts * of * one type * of road , the autobahn , or freeway , do n't have speed limits . 
  yes , but is it normal ? 
  is this normal , what he 's doing ? 
  seriously , do you think this is normal ? 
   they are complaining about a different topic . 
  ftfy . 
  let 's not pretend no voters are `` fighting '' a `` battle '' . 
  uhm ... no ? 
  please let me stay ? 
  i have papers , i am legit , really !, 
  the reason i quoted this one was because both the judge and the da argued for or against those two key points ( 1 . possible to avoid/flee , and 2 . proportionality ) when it came to deciding whether self-defense was applicable , showing that those two make up the `` test '' to see if self-defense applies . 
   rejecting low-risk candidates like the phd coming for a conference , yet allow high-risk refugees please stop saying this . 
  this did n't happen . 
  the phd is not crossing a border from greece by foot , asking for asylum , is he ? 
  hopeless migrants would also not get accepted for the visum op was applying for . 
  however , if he was willing to leave all his possessions behind and spend months walking through countries , or paying human traffickers and risking his life on dingy boats , then sure , he 'd get in and be able to travel to austria to see his old university . 
  the two methods ( fleeing your country by foot versus applying for a visum ) are not comparable in the slightest . 
  yeah , here 's a case from 2010 : http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ecli:nl:rblee:2010:bl8624 the defendant and her ( boy ? ), 
  friend were in their house . 
  they were involved in a dispute with neigbours . 
  they noticed multiple guys kicking and banging on their front door and window , kicking in a panel of the front door . 
  while on the phone with 112 , the front door was opened , something was thrown and the defendant stabbed the intruders . 
  she was charged with two counts of attempted manslaughter . 
  dutch text :  de officier van justitie heeft ter terechtzitting het standpunt ingenomen dat er geen sprake is geweest van een noodweersituatie . 
  the da argues that : 1 . 
  they could have left through the back door , escaping the imminent danger 2 . 
  since the assailants ( described as `` boys '' ) did not have a visible weapon , using a knife was excessive then , the court finds/considers that :  de rechtbank overweegt als volgt . 
  summarized : - two assailants , one wearing a hoodie , having consumed alcohol , went to defendant 's house to seek redress for something . 
  - they awoke defendant and friend by banging and kicking on the door and window , and yelling loudly .
