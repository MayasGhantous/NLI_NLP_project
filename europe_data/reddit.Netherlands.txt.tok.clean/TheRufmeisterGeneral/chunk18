  i lived in the us as well , in a suburb in the midwest , ni asian hipster bakeries for us . 
  nope they put that shit in bread to make it sweet . 
  i was not a fan . 
  it 's panhandling . 
  you 're being manipulated for a larger tip . 
  heinz has a `` spicy ketchup '' ( at least here in nl ) that fulfills all my ketchup needs . 
  most americans do n't buy bread from a bakery though . 
  94 % of what is present in the `` bread '' aisle in an average supermarket is soft , sweetened crap . 
  for those not familiar with american bread : they ** sweeten ** their bread , with either sugar or , worse , high-fructose corn syrup . 
  are n't you happy that the americans are aware of the pinnacle of french cuisine ? 
  endemol is dutch ... sorry . 
  compared to the uk , where , of course , there is a large , well-off and balanced middle class , which is benefiting from the uk 's economic growth over the last few decades . 
  / s you 'll instead find that germany has very good sex education ( and education in general ) and a very honest attitude towards discussing sex-related topics , whereas in the uk , sex ed is shit , there is a * huge * lower class full of chavs who are fucking out of boredom and do n't even know how to do that properly , leading to lots of teenage pregnancy . 
  kind of like in the us . 
  based on what ? 
  an orange in dutch is called `` sinaasappel '' . 
  that does n't make it an apple . 
  a glove is called `` handschoen '' or a `` hand shoe '' . 
  that does n't mean it 's a type of shoe . 
  statutory rape , wrong or not , is not rape . 
  ... says a scotsman ? 
  not that i 've seen you actually swear , but that still seems hypocritical , somehow . 
  rape is rape , and statutory rape is not rape . 
  it 's perfectly possible to make your case about how wrong it is to have sex with a 13-year-old without calling an apple an orange , diminishing the unrelated horrible act of * actual * rape in the process . 
  which i completely agree is a problem that needs to be addressed as well , and i hope that in the meantime , there are talks between governments right now , to close such loopholes , such as the incredibly embarrassing '' [ dutch sandwich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement#dutch_sandwich ) '' . 
  however , i 'm also glad that such individual agreements are addressed , which we need a lot more of as well . 
  nah , i heard they speak better english in the middle east . 
  just because * a different * problem also exists and is n't fixed with this , does n't mean it 's not good that * this problem * is fixed . 
  the $ 30m is nice , but the bigger issue is that it 's made clear that * no country * is allowed to make such deals . 
  that is potentially huge , because it would eliminate the `` shopping around for the best deal '' amongst eu nations that companies like starbucks has done . 
  the netherlands has given them this deal , because otherwise they would have gotten a different deal from a different country and headquartered there . 
  but if * no * eu country is allowed to give deals , then these companies wo n't get any deal which will stop this `` race to the bottom '' between eu nations about who can promise the shittiest deals . 
  or worse , birmingham . 
  i think you are wrong . 
  it 's getting worse . 
  fences are being erected that were n't there before , the weather it getting colder and wetter and there are suddenly border checks , sometimes even within shengen . 
  unless you 're talking about changes in the last few * years * not months , in which case i 'm not sure . 
  interesting and good to hear . 
  thanks for the context . 
   but when the state becomes controlled by islamist dickbags , problems come considering how backwards ( due to fanatical christians ) quite a bit of legislation in america 's red states are , this seems a tad hypocritical . 
  israel is n't secular in the slightest , from what i 've heard . 
  it 's just non-secular around a * different * religion . 
  have i heard wrong ? 
  it 's not semantics . 
  there 's a big difference between staying where you are , but feeling safer , or `` pushing back '' as you 're trying to make it sound . 
  also , why are you bringing the us into this ? 
  that 's a very russian thing to do , blaming the us for stuff while they 're not relevant to the discussion . 
  russia did n't `` pull ** their share ** of bs '' , they invaded a country and annexed a chunk of it . 
  nato has n't done this . 
  the us has n't done this . 
  * nobody * has done this , besides russia . 
  russia is the sole and only aggressor state in europe , threatening other nations . 
  and once again , you mention `` their weariness '' where before you mentioned `` pissing off '' russia . 
  ** i do n't give a fuck ** whether russia is pissed off or not . 
  i have no wish for russia to be pissed off , but if russia * chooses * to be pissed off because of other countries ' affairs , then fuck them . 
  russia ( or putin , really ) is behaving like a child . 
  it 's misbehaving , showing a lack of empathy and a viciously selfish streak . 
  it 's violently lashing out at neighbours for not liking it , it 's taken stuff from others by force and when that was n't met with impunity , it 's thrown a temper tantrum ( bulldozing dutch cheese , * really * ? ), 
  and in the meantime , it keeps poking others , to see how annoyed they get , and to see whether one get angry ( continuously violating air space ) . 
  and whenever someone questions russia 's actions , it very predictably 1 ) points to others , saying they did a bad thing too ( as if that excuses russia somehow ) and 2 ) pretends to be the victim , regardless of what the actual circumstances are . 
  you know what you are ? 
  ( assuming you 're not a russian shill , which you just * might * be . ), 
  you 're an enabler . 
  here is a child , whining and crying that it does n't get to steal * even more * candy , because a big man is protecting the other kids , and you 'd be inclined to say : `` look at poor little russia !, 
  do n't you see how upset you 're making him by not giving him his way ? 
  ca n't you tell how badly he wants the other kid 's candy and how that 's making him cry ? 
  does that other kid * really need * his candy anyway ? 
  surely , at some point in history , a different kid also took someone else 's candy , so it does n't matter anyway . 
  stop meddling with the kids and just let them play amongst themselves , your presence here is upsetting russia . '', 
  hence , enabler . 
  if someone behaves like that , you do n't give them their way , because it will only make everything worse . 
  you isolate yourself from them and make sure they ca n't harm you or your friends and just hope that whoever is able to punish russia ( the electorate ? 
  probably not , since its elections and media are corrupt as shit ) eventually gives it a slap on the wrist . 
  lastly ,  and nato do n't ? 
  nato does n't . 
  you should read this : http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/115204.htm, 
  i would phrase `` to contain the soviet threat '' as `` protect against foreign aggression '' . 
  it might seem like a nuance , but it 's important . 
  if a country complains because it 's not able to attack certain countries with impunity , does that make the to-be-attacked country at fault ? 
  or should the complaining country just shut up and accept that we should n't be attacking/invading neighbouring countries anymore ? 
  also , do n't forget that nato is n't * only * directed at soviets/russia , but foreign aggression in general ( if assad were to attack turkey outright , for example , that would also invoke article 5 ) . 
  and calling russia simply a `` thorn in the side '' seems a bit absurd , considering what has been going on in ukraine . 
  have you forgotten that they militarily invaded and annexed a part of a neighbouring country ? 
  and the violent shithole they 've created in eastern ukraine ? 
  ** russia is a nation , that uses its military as a tool of aggression , to invade , annex and destabilize neighbouring countries ** . 
  considering that , and how it 's next to several small countries who have felt both the boot and the yoke of russian occupation before , it 's a good thing we have nato to keep them safe . 
  i daresay we sound more intelligent when speaking dutch than a brummie who 's trying to speak english . 
  regardless of whether you understand dutch or not . 
  :p i was n't making fun of the scots though , i 'm not sure why , but i * love * the scottish accent . 
  for context : [ the awesome schnappi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka3dijkcju4 ) . 
  maybe he 's making fun of the way you guys `` pronounce '' things ? 
  in that case , he should go and visit birmingham to have a listen . 
  * truthiness * having that gut feeling that tells you you 're right . 
  nato is not an aggressor . 
  why do you have a swastika for a username ? 
  i 'm not arguing with you . 
  giving you counter-arguments implies that your absurd claims are worth arguing in favour of . 
  it would be validating them in a sense . 
  hence the expression : `` feeding the trolls . '', 
  i 'm not doing that , i 'm just telling you that your claims are silly .
