  i went from watching aladdin and jurassic park on vhs to piracy and only netflix was able to sway me away from piracy . 
  i never understood why people go to a store for a plastic disc , when you can start any movie you want with a few clicks of a mouse ( applies for both netflix and piracy ) . 
  if you 're going to do the whataboutism game : can you russian assholes please stop funding far-right parties in the eu ? 
   so being a billionaire makes you superhuman or something ? 
  the opposite , being `` superhuman '' make you a billionaire . 
  not in a `` superhero '' kind of way , of course , but most billionaires know how to do pr at least moderately and/or what kind of communication would be proper or beneficial for an enterprise . 
  people do n't commonly `` luck into '' billions while being a foot-in-mouth retard . 
  ouch . 
  but that 's why new media like netflix is great , you can choose different audio and/or subtitles on the fly !, 
  makes it easier for young people to hear movies undubbed , if they wish !, 
  holy crap , til . 
  sorry , germany . 
  spanish , right ? 
  ~ ~ haha , you 've not seen the pink panther then ? ~ ~ ok , i feel stupid , apparently , pink panther is british , and insp. 
  clouseau is actually peter sellers , as british as they come . 
  * facepalm * on topic : i loved taxi as well , very funny movie !, 
  oh , +1 for hot fuzz !, 
  i * loved * that movie !, 
  also known as : the professional , particularly in the us . 
  i heard many people enjoyed this movie . 
  how many ? 
  this many : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujzutlvblr8 [ 0:04 ], 
  also known as : `` la vita \u00e8 bella '' for those not familiar with the english title . 
  notice the question mark at the end . 
  i 'm * asking * you whether you do , because i 've noticed it being common amongst * other * limburgers . 
   in large part , a response to what others consider us : less than them . 
  i am `` others '' , as are people i hang out with both here in enschede and in other places in holland . 
  i/we do n't consider you : `` less than us . '', 
  we 're just occasionally annoyed by childish tantrums you can throw , and other silly things , like misappropriating and altering parts of the dutch language , like what the word `` holland '' means . 
  and even your view on that word : have fun with it , have local culture where you do things slightly differently . 
  fine . 
  just ** stop claiming your local mannerisms as national facts towards unknowing foreigners . 
  because i 've heard limburgers use the term to mean : `` somebody who 's north of the rivers and/or from the randstad , or at least speaks as if they are . '', 
  also , the word `` hollander '' is used often enough , but i very seriously doubt you 'll compare someone 's arrogance to that of a `` gelderlander '' or whatever . 
  and yes , i know it 'd be hypocritical . 
  i am subtly accusing you of being a hypocrite . 
  * really * though ? 
  you do n't use the term `` hollander '' for someone from e.g. 
  colour me sceptical . 
  sigh ... more nuanced and boring : i am honestly convinced that if you were to hold a national poll amongst the dutch , that the overwhelming majority does n't mind the term `` holland '' being used as a nickname for the country , and that -- although a slightly smaller -- a huge majority uses the word to describe the country themselves from time to time . 
   it 's not really about what you consider yourself . 
  the reason you see this kind of behavior coming from the south is , in large part , a response to what others consider us : less than them . 
  where did this come from ? 
  yes , you occasionally get mocked for so overwhelmingly voting for the xenophobic retard geert wilders . 
  and your accent is funny . 
  but guess what , so is the hague accent , and the frisian accent is even worse . 
  if you have a frisian farmer speaking in his native `` dialect '' it can be troubling indeed to figure out what he 's saying . 
  as * children * , perhaps the accent would get you teased , but then again , so does having red hair or being tall . 
  children are cruel idiots . 
  [ educational video from hilversum about this issue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pa3c5fcfuw ) . 
  similarly , children who have been raised around amersfoort ( * not * in `` holland '' , mind you ! ), 
  with a `` bekakte r '' would get teased if they 'd have to move to limburg as well . 
  seriously though , there is sometimes annoyance at limburgers for the accent , but amongst adults only when * you 're difficult to understand * . 
  which has nothing to do with your specific province . 
  if someone from rural twente goes into enschede ( part of twente , mind you ) and starts talking * in a thick twents accent * ( think : from a finkers comedy sketch ) to a shop employee who was raised in utrecht , you 'll get the same problems and resulting annoyance . 
  i 'm honestly saddened by the notion that people like you ( i hope it 's not literally the norm in limburg ) feel that there 's a `` holland vs. limburg '' divide . 
  as i 've said in a different comment , me and people that i 've talked to this about in the randstad ( more accurate than the silly `` holland '' ) do n't feel this way at all . 
  at most , there 's a divide between urban and rural netherlands . 
  but for that , you do n't have to travel far . 
  go a little bit west out of utrecht and you 'll find smaller , more religious towns around gouda , or slightly east , and find similar towns around amersfoort ( e.g. 
  but at no point do we want to kick those towns out of the country . 
  although it would be nice if they 'd stop lobbying to keep shops closed on sundays . 
   we do n't want to be part of the nationality that those assholes consider theirs . 
  it 's * ours * . 
  you are part of the netherlands !, 
  and thus part of what i consider holland !, 
  again , from the context of someone who is both raised outside of nh/zh and lives outside of it as well . 
  netherlands is the formal name , holland is the cute nickname under which banner we unite and shout at germany that we 're better at football than them . 
    i 'd rather be german than i would dutch . 
  i usually tell people i am german , anyway . 
  i cheer for the german football team . 
  i watch german television and listen to german radio . 
  look , i 'm friendly towards limburgers in general , although i try and prevent some misunderstandings from being spread in this thread . 
  but , if you feel that way then , honestly , you 're a lost case and you 're welcome to piss off . 
  not just as a figure of speech either . 
  germany has lots of places that are great to live . 
  rolling hills , huge forests and nice cities . 
  and thanks to the eu , you 're free to move and work there . 
   our dialect ( not accent ) is more closely related to german than it appears to be to dutch and the northern-swiss dialect * sounds * more like dutch than german , if you 're not interpreting the actual words themselves . 
  should we annex them putin-style then ? 
   we did n't join the rest of the country until very late `` late '' is relative , but you sure as fuck did n't experience this . 
  it 's hypthetical shit from books . 
  if this sort of stuff matters , then we might as well lay a claim to northern belgium as well . 
   and we are a distinctly different people from the rest of the country no , you 're not . 
  there are very few `` proto-dutch '' places . 
  i 'd reckon amersfoort ( again , not `` holland '' according to your definition ) maybe qualifies , as being `` normal '' dutch enough , without a distinct own character . 
  yes , sometimes you 're weird . 
  you have some local habits and accents , but guess what : so does amsterdam . 
  honestly , how often have you been there ? 
  downtown amsterdam feels more `` alien '' and `` non-dutch '' to me than an average frisian town . 
  but they do n't complain like you do . 
  small , religious towns in/near the randstad feel weird as well , with their different mannerisms , their looking down upon us decadent folk who want to do shopping on sundays ( not even kidding there ) , but nobody suggests removing them from the country . 
   and whether you and i like it or not , we are still part of it . 
  we * do * like it . 
  and you * are * part of the country . 
  we just mock you sometimes when you do stupid shit , like vote for wilders or whine like a little bitch about how feel different . 
  so what . 
  everybody does from time to time . 
  and it seems hypocritical that you are complaining about tolerance , since a limburger will be able to live in the randstad just fine , but when my sister lived in limburg for a few years during her studies , she would on occasion feel * really unwelcome * there , when locals would single her out as a `` hollander '' , which is one of the reasons why the term `` hollander '' ( which has nothing to do with the term `` holland '' ) pisses me off . 
  that word is not an objective thing about provinces , it 's a way for limburgers to single out people that they feel are `` not like them '' .
