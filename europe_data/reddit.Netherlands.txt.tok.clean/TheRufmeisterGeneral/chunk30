   what other systems ? 
  exactly . 
  as someone from the same country which has many cyclists ... opening your car door , after which a cyclist runs into it is not ** `` literally killing a cyclist '' ** . 
  let 's not pretend he was driving at 135km/h while drunk through a city centre . 
  yes , that 's a fun movie and all , but glover would have deserved to be trialed and sentenced for murder for that . 
  even without the diplomatic immunity , he straight up shot a guy in the head , who at that point was no threat whatsoever to him or anyone else . 
  where i come from , we call that murder . 
  even if a cop does it . 
  he even had the time and clarity of mind to think of a stupid 80s pun before he shot . 
  so , tit-for-tat ? 
  like sharia ? 
  or the way russia considers justice ? 
  sure , let 's stoop to that level . 
  as someone who has friends living in the hague , you are grossly exaggerating the problem . 
  it 's an annoyance if you 're often in the few spots in the country where diplomats often come , which is generally a few neighbourhoods in the hague . 
  there is no `` solution '' needed . 
  diplomatic immunity is a * very * important tool for enabling international diplomacy with any country in the world . 
  and suggesting dismantling such a powerful tool for something as trivial as a few parking tickets is absurd . 
  you 're indian ? 
  welcome to / r/europe . 
  do you guys use bicycles often too ? 
  now that i have your attention , can you please encourage more of your fellow indians to come set up restaurants here ? 
  your cuisine is delicious , but it 's very difficult to find here in holland , and thus very expensive , when you do find a place . 
  if you want a subreddit with a circlejerk and agenda , go ask / r/the _ donald how they feel about trump . 
  there 's a 100 % agreement ratio , because if you disagree , you get banned . 
  that 's not at all the case here . 
  there are more people pro-eu than anti-eu commenters in this sub , but c'est la vie . 
  sometimes one opinion is more popular than another . 
  imagine if that would n't be the case . 
  would make polls incredibly boring . 
  and i did n't insinuate shit . 
  people in certain environments are more likely to have one opinion over another . 
  and your hurt feelings do n't change such things . 
  besides being upset that i said it , though , do you disagree ? 
  have you witnessed older , rural people to be more pro-eu than younger , urban people ? 
  if so , i 'd be interested to hear where that is , because that 's * definitely not * the case in the netherlands . 
  you misinterpreted my comment , methinks . 
  if you live in an urban environment , going to `` third-level '' education , you 're * statistically more likely * to be pro-eu . 
  if you look around you , you might notice that in that environment , more people are likely to be pro-eu , than e.g. 
  amongst older people , if you have a decent enough sample size ( you might not know enough old people , i do n't know ) . 
  now , for ** the reasons ** for that , that 's a different discussion . 
  i have my own theories , of course . 
  but i kept those to myself in my comment to * not * sound like i 'm saying what you 're accusing me of . 
   the vast majority of the pro-eu types in my college have no clue as to how the eu actually operates and what that entails for the member nation that is a very arrogant thing to claim . 
  it 's also one of the signs that you 're possibly dealing with a conspiracy theory : the idea that people who disagree simply `` do n't know what they 're talking about '' or are `` naive to believe what the msm tells them . '', 
  it 's also usually bullshit . 
  just for context : nobody here ( except maybe the bloody germans themselves ) is claiming that the german system makes sense . 
  it 's a stupid idea to capitalise every noun , and they should stop doing it . 
  it 's not just about money . 
  sure , they 've * financially * been a net contributor , but they 've tried very hard to halt progress many times , including wanting exceptions for everything , like the eurozone , shengen , etc. 
  there is no agenda . 
  statistically , better-educated , urban , young people tend to like the eu more than the get-off-my-lawn old people in small towns . 
  statistically , the first group is also much more likely to write comments on reddit . 
  at least in my country , the majority of people like the eu and want to stay in it , but the amount of dutchmen * on reddit * who feel that way is even higher . 
  and to be honest , it makes sense that if you 're in a place where common topics are those that are relevant across borders , discussed in english , you 're going to find people that are more likely to think that international , pan-european cooperation is a good thing . 
  poop is universally hated . 
  that does n't mean there 's a weird anti-poop agenda or conspiracy going on . 
  sometimes people just share an opinion because it 's an appealing opinion , not because of some agenda pushing them . 
  but at least you do n't have that dreadful ability to vote on eu decisions !, 
  even more than we already do ? 
  i like it because it 's so similar to the dutch pronunciation , and it 's indeed less work to write . 
  occupied by our nemesis . 
  `` temporarily occupied '' makes more sense than `` gone '' in this context . 
  to be fair , we 've defeated the sea more often than we 've defeated nazi germany . 
  this would just be a temporary setback . 
  how is the `` czechia '' name catching on , by the way ? 
  your potatoes were taken * yet again * ? 
  you should read that german article again . 
  it does n't back up your claim . 
  my french is n't very good , unfortunately . 
  i trust the national intelligence agencies of half a dozen western countries more than an anonymous troll on the internet . 
  i have no hatred against putin , but his ideals and actions are the opposite of a free democracy . 
  supporting putin by using this opportunity to suggest his hackers are innocent or that we support his lap dog al-assad is not in line with western liberal values . 
  why the pro-russia shit , buddy ? 
  and unfortunately they can only be reelected once in france , i heard . 
  how sad is that ? 
  i wonder who came up with that stupid rule . 
  he is very much behaving like an autocrat . 
  from wikipedia :  orb\u00e1n is seen as having laid out his political views most concretely in a widely cited 2014 public address at b\u0103ile tu\u0219nad ( known in hungary as the tusn\u00e1df\u00fcrd\u0151i besz\u00e9d , or `` tusn\u00e1df\u00fcrd\u0151 speech '' ) . 
  in the address , orb\u00e1n repudiated the classical liberal theory of the state as a free association of atomistic individuals . 
  in his view , the state is the means of organizing , invigorating , or even constructing the national community . 
  though this kind of state respects traditionally liberal concepts like civic rights , it is properly called `` illiberal '' because it views the community , and not the individual , as the basic political unit . 
  [ 63 ] in practice , orb\u00e1n claimed , such a state should promote national self-sufficiency , national sovereignty , familialism , full employment , and the preservation of cultural heritage , and cited countries such as turkey , singapore , russia , and china as models . 
  [ 63 ]  orb\u00e1n 's second and third premierships have been the subject of significant international controversy , and reception of his political views is mixed . 
  the 2011 constitutional changes enacted under his leadership were , in particular , accused of centralizing legislative and executive power , curbing civil liberties , restricting freedom of speech , and weakening the constitutional court and judiciary . 
  [ 64 ] for these reasons , some critics have described him as `` irredentist '' , [ 65 ] `` populist '' , [ 66 ] `` authoritarian '' , [ 67 ] `` putinist '' , [ 68 ] as a `` strongman '' , [ 69 ] and as a `` dictator '' . 
  merkel is not an autocrat or a dictator . 
  do you want me to link to a wikipedia page , explaining how the german democratic system works ? 
  and all those illegal immigrants want to come to one of the poorest countries in it , with an unintelligible language , while being run by an autocrat ? 
  i mean no offense , i visited budapest fairly recently , and love the city and the hungarian people , but let 's be honest , you have * very little * to worry about when it comes to illegal immigrants . 
  the * country * of greece took they money , first from the lenders then from the eu . 
  you need people to represent a country , because you ca n't have a conversation with millions of people at once . 
  tough titties , that 's how life works . 
   they do n't care about getting money . 
  they just want to destroy us economically . 
  absolute . 
  if you honestly believe this , please check your media intake to see if you 're overdosing on weird conspiracy news sources . 
  because that 's so absurd that i ca n't believe you actually think that . 
    do you honestly think that the eu wants to see greece bankrupt ? 
    yes .
