  i 'd make a joke about wilders being from limburg , or limburgers voting for him , but that 's sad enough by itself , besides , his example as a xenophobic populist was fortuyn , from rotterdam , so that does n't really fly . 
  honestly : * you * are the one that are making a problem of this . 
  the less you guys stop bitching about how unique and special you guys are , the less we northerners ( even us non - `` hollanders '' ) will joke about how you 're welcome to piss off and join belgium . 
   you always turn into an old lady when you are hungry . 
  hehe . 
  subtle . 
  i do n't have a problem with people having an opinion . 
  i have a problem with people , who have an opinion , which is a clear minority opinion , presenting said opinion as fact . 
  / u/monsieursander is n't suggesting that * some * dutch do n't like the term `` holland '' , no instead he 's saying that it 's plain * wrong * and that people ( even in english ! ), 
  should stop using it . 
  as if that 's somehow the way that * the dutch * feel about that word . 
  and it plainly is n't . 
  yes , `` silly fanatics '' is a strong term , but it immediately conveys the notion that people that are strongly against using `` holland '' are a vocal minority and that people ( especially when speaking english ) should not be dissuaded by them from using their favourite nickname for our country . 
   you know , dismissing the opinions of everyone who does n't live in holland is exactly why `` hollander '' is an insult in the rural provinces . 
  again , this is nonsense . 
  there is no `` holland vs. the rest '' divide . 
  only a few specific places see it that way . 
  ironically , nobody ( that i know of ) in the randstad is aware of such a divide nor aware of the term `` hollander '' in the way that you use it . 
  and outside the randstad , it 's not common either . 
  as i 've said before , i live in twente , and it 's not a thing here . 
  i 've asked some friends who lived their whole lives here in twente , and they 're fine with `` holland '' for the whole country and never heard the term `` hollander '' used to describe someone from the randstad . 
  so , i 'm sorry that * some * rural places feel alienated from the rest of the country . 
  if there 's something that could be done to change that , that 'd be great . 
  but in the meantime , suggesting to foreign redditors that there 's a huge split down the middle of the country is n't helping anyone and is plain bullshit . 
  2 en nr . 
  damn , dat zijn best high standards , 
  yes , can we add the netherlands to that chart ? 
  surely , we must have boomed way more massively than slow giant germany !, 
  they 're not mutually exclusive though . 
  i consider myself dutch , and european at the same time , for example . 
  but i do n't have a weird name for `` the europeans outside of holland '' . 
  not `` all of a sudden '' , the name has been in use for centuries . 
  and yes , it matters how many people use it . 
  it wo n't change the official name of the country , but enough people use it that it 's a common and accepted ** nickname ** of the country . 
  yes , that must be it . 
  my problem is that i do n't watch enough limburg tv . 
  that 's my point . 
  i was obviously talking about * the country * , i even clarified it as such . 
  but because you 're stuck with the wrong meaning of the word , you assumed i was talking about the region . 
  i was n't . 
  if we can all agree that holland is a nickname for the country , then there wo n't be confusion anymore . 
  and you 're free to ignore that meaning and not use it yoursef . 
  that 's fine . 
  just do n't correct foreigners with bullshit misinformation . 
  do you actually have your own day though ? 
  or is it just halfway between the french and dutch national holidays ? 
  would be interesting , to look those up on a calendar and see which two days are in the middle of those . 
  i 'm not `` hollandcentric '' . 
  i was not raised in nh/zh and do not live in nh/zh . 
  i just like to be able to communicate efficiently without people whining about pedantic bullshit that only their local little towns give a shit about . 
  for the record : `` hollander '' is not a common word in most of the country . 
  only in those areas that define themselves by `` not being that other part '' of holland . 
  the country . 
  i 'm pretty sure a few of the more outlying provinces ( especially limburg , possibly friesland ) will have a hissy fit over this :d, 
  holland is a nickname for the country `` the netherlands '' . 
  the original/technical meaning is a different geograpic area than the country . 
  america is a nickname for `` the usa '' . 
  the original/technical meaning is a different geographic area than the country . 
  see how that analogy works ? 
  it 's actually quite a decent analogy . 
  yes , because www.ruhrgebiet.de is their official tourism website , and they shout `` gehen , ruhrgebiet , gehen ! '', 
  during football matches , and their location for partying during olympics is called `` ruhrgebiet bier h\u00e4use '' , and they have a tv show called `` ich liebe ruhrgebiet '' , right ? 
  sure , that analogy makes sense . 
  strange . 
  here in twente/overijssel , it 's completely normal . 
  you deserve to be deported from our glorious nation for disrespecting the national football team like that !, 
  is it true what the crazy limburger said , that you consider people from the randstad `` hollanders '' and that you see yourself `` not a hollander '' ? 
  i only heard that bit of craziness from limburg and maybe brabant , but have n't heard that from frisians before . 
  please ignore the silly fanatics . 
  holland is a * de-facto * name for the country . 
  just like * technically * `` america '' is the name for north-america and south-america combined , but in practice , everybody understands what you 're talking about when you mention the country `` america '' and its people `` americans '' . 
  please * do * refer to us as holland !, 
  we do , ourselves , as well !, 
  / u/monsieursander is a pedantic little shit who has a weird `` limburg vs. the rest of the country '' inferiority complex . 
  pay him no mind . 
  i understand * why * some people might feel the urge to break down complex situations or situation-specific opinions into simple blanket pro-x claims , but it 's still a dumb habit . 
  aw shucks , thanks !, 
  :d i 'd say something back , but i ca n't see any flair about where you 're from ... 
  is this a reference to supermarkets asking you to donate a dollar when checking out , and then supermarkets using * those * dollars to claiming taxes back due to `` them '' donating money to a tax-exempt charity ? 
  if so , then , yeah !, 
  those bastards !, 
  fuck that pro-a or pro-b nonsense . 
  if a company is evading taxes , then that should be handled , regardless of the country of origin . 
  if however , those tax shenanigans hurt a country that desperately needs those taxes , it 's even more dire . 
  the idea that i do n't like tax evaders makes me `` pro-greek '' or that i do n't think we should preemptively cancel a part of the greek debt , makes me `` pro-german '' is a stupid oversimplification . 
  just judge each situation by itself , i like to think that in ( / r / ) europe we do n't need to stupidly pigeonhole countries using cliches in order to have an opinion . 
  well , seeing as how i live in the city of the grolsch brewery ... that 'd be an obvious candidate . 
   wait , we 're not literally invading , right ? 
  i was just making a cheeky reference how lots of danes go into germany to buy booze . 
  and in other countries further north , i 've heard the situation is even worse , concerning alcohol . 
  ( not counting finland ), 
  charity implies that you 're * giving * the money to someone , not * lending * it to them . 
  seriously though , regardless of where you stand on that discussion , it wo n't become relevant until * after * a decision has been made to cancel part of the debt , which wo n't happen for the near future . 
  who knows what later in time will bring though . 
  also , the way football fans behave . 
  dutch football fans during big international tournaments are fairly universally loved , it 's actually a point of pride how well-behaved the orange legion is . 
  english ( and/or uk ) fans ... no to much . 
  that made me look again , wondering what the us 's own rating is . 
  there is none , they did n't include it . 
  because i know * one * chart that the us would top .
