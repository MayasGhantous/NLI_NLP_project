   edit : i realize they simply did n't interview americans , just europeans * about * ( amongst other things ) america . 
  would still be interesting to see though . 
   we still beat you https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_fifa_world_cup hehe . 
  taxes do * not * count as charity !, 
  or if they do , at least bring alcohol :d, 
  yay !, 
  you guys like us !, 
  we 're `` olanda , '' right ? 
  i was thinking more along the lines of : removing some of the protected status of certain professions , allowing over-the-counter drugs to be sold in supermarkets and not just in apothecaries , for example . 
  that kind of measure will get through now , but ten years ago , a government that tried to change that , freeing up that market ( which is the interest of the average consumer ! ), 
  would have caused huge strikes and protests from pharmacists . 
  and there are tons of little things like that , where people give up certain benefits and protections , that are common sense to get rid of , but without the crisis people would have fought hard against any politician that tried to change it . 
  also , people need to stop bitching about the pensions . 
  yes , it sucks , but if the country goes bankrupt , the pensions will suffer as well . 
  there is no option that lets greece simply spend money the way it has been doing for the last ten years . 
  to clarify , i am ** absolutely not ** defending circumcision . 
  i personally think it should be illegal , and although i understand that in europe , there would be a debate of `` body integrity vs. religious freedom '' ( on which i side with bodily integrity ) , in the us , the way it 's done willy-nilly there , is a complete outrage and should be stopped . 
  that being said , it is absolutely not comparable to the horrific practice of female genital mutilation . 
  read up on what it exactly entails on wikipedia , if you 're in doubt : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/female_genital_mutilation or do n't . 
  it 's fairly gruesome . 
  maybe if circumcision entailed not cutting off the foreskin , but cutting off the entire * head * of the penis , maybe then it would be comparable . 
  but if that were the case , we would n't calmly be having a discussion on whether perhaps we should allow this or not , or whether it perhaps falls within religious freedom . 
  no , if that were the case , we would have fiercely outlawed it within the same day . 
  for fgm : i how we , as europe , deploy all resources we can to protect out citizens , even if it means taking a child away from their parents until we can be sure she wo n't be kidnapped and dragged to africa to have her body mutilated . 
  for circumcision : i think it 's a bad practice , based in antiquity and/or ignorance , not practical use , and i 'm optimistic that one day it will be outlawed , just like `` kosher/halal '' butchering of animals . 
  but let 's not grab kids at airports because we suspect that the american expat might `` mutilate '' their kid in the us while on vacation . 
  that would be a tad silly . 
   mgm , which although ** arguably ** not comparable with fmg is still pretty bad that 's a huge distinction . 
  it 's not arguable . 
  it 's not comparable . 
  i 'm a bit disappointed how many downvotes i 've gotten . 
  maybe it 's because i called the guy an asshole . 
  here 's my point : i think they 're both bad . 
  but cutting the clitoris off a woman and/or sewing shut her vagina is ** absolutely not ** comparable to circumcision , after which men are able to function just fine , masturbate just fine , and have healthy and fulfilling sex lives without intervention . 
  i * do * think circumcision is bad , it 's just on a completely different level though . 
  it 's like comparing child abuse to isis setting prisoners on fire . 
  absolutely do i condemn parents who angrily shout at their kids for stuff that is n't their fault , and hit them across the face when they could have taught the child a lesson by non-violent means , like sending them to their room . 
  but that in no way is comparable to isis burning a pow alive on camera in the hopes that it will scare countries into no longer bombing them . 
  both bad , as agreed upon by everyone . 
  but not comparable . 
  and comparing the burning alive of a prisoner to a kid being slapped across the face for not cleaning his room , is a huge disservice to the victims of isis . 
  no , that 's not the same . 
  not even comparable . 
  sales tax is a percentage and thus will grow with inflation . 
  a very simple example , with made-up numbers ( 50 % inflation between 1993 and now ) : - 1993 : object costs $ 100 , 5 % sales tax -  $ 5 tax income - 2015 : object costs $ 150 , 5 % sales tax -  $ 7,50 tax income however , with the federal gasoline tax , it 's a ** fixed amount per gallon ** !, 
  which has n't been adjusted since 1993 . 
  another simple example , somebody buying 10 gallons of gasoline : - 1993 : 10 gallons costs $ 10 , tax : 10 x $ 0.184 -  $ 1.84 tax income - 2015 : 10 gallons costs $ 30 , tax : 10 x $ 0.184 -  $ 1.84 tax income do you see how that 's not the same at all ? 
  what you have done is simple : you 've seen the phrase : `` raise tax '' and this has triggered an anger in you , where you simply repeat the neocon/tea mantras of not wanting to be taxed more . 
  if you simply and calmly read again what i said about ** adjusting the tax for inflation ** then surely you must agree . 
  after all , you * do * prefer your roads to be properly maintained and intact , no ? 
  what nonsense is this ? 
  the netherlands is a founding member of the eu , we are 16 million people small , which , although small for eu standards , is 30x larger than malta . 
  but , if our pm were addressing the eu parliament and there was a mishap , causing no translator to be present , i would expect him to speak english and continue on . 
  in fact , i would expect him to speak english anyway . 
  if our dutch pm would try to speak dutch to the eu parliament , or even walk away upset if there was no translator , i would be very , very ashamed as a dutchman . 
  this is a whiny little bitch who is putting his principles and insecurities about pragmatically overcoming obstacles and working together . 
  edit : sorry for overreacting , he might just been having a bad day in general , with this being the straw breaking the camel 's back . 
  either way , it just seems so very , very unimportant which language is spoken . 
  as long as the message is clear and you get stuff done . 
  please do n't compare fmg with circumcision . 
  it invalidates the rest of your argument because it makes you look like an asshole . 
  no offense , just saying . 
  good point , different discussion though . 
  it 's like how america , a fairly rich country , has roads that are completely falling apart . 
  it can be fixed fairly easily , by raising a small tax , which is meant for road repairs , to levels that it should be at , simply due to inflation since the last time it was changed . 
  but voters will get very angry in the us towards politicians who raise taxes . 
  so , the roads keep falling apart , even though americans can easily pay for decent roads . 
  and most would n't even notice the tiny increase in fuel tax that would pay for it . 
  edit , a quote from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuel_taxes_in_the_united_states ) :  the federal gasoline tax raised $ 25 billion on gasoline in 2006 . 
  [ 6 ] the tax was last raised in 1993 , and is not indexed to inflation . 
  the inflation rate from 1993 until 2015 was 64.6 per cent . 
  this means , that you need 1.65 us-dollar in 2015 to get the same buying power as in 1993 . 
  [ 7 ] another quote from a [ different wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/highway_trust_fund ) :  solvency issues  from 2008 to 2010 , congress authorized the transfer of $ 35 billion from the general fund of the u.s. treasury to keep the trust fund solvent . 
  [ 7 ]  the congressional budget office ( cbo ) projected in january 2012 that the fund 's highway account will become insolvent during 2013 , and the mass transit account insolvent in 2014 . 
  cbo said that although vehicles will travel more miles in the future ( therefore consuming more taxable fuel ) , rising fuel efficiency standards and congressional refusal to increase the fuel tax or tie it to the rate of inflation means that the fund receives less money . 
  cbo 's insolvency projection assumed that congress will not increase transportation spending beyond inflation-adjusted 2012 levels . 
  [ 7 ]  the highway trust fund will run out of money in late july or early august 2015 as of late june 2015 without an increase in gas taxes . 
  [ 8 ] the gas tax has not been raised for such a long time , an increase is dubious . 
   in 2013 , the u.s. chamber of commerce supported raising the federal gasoline tax to keep the fund solvent . 
  [ 9 ]  after concerns that funding would not be extended by the united states congress before funds dried up in august 2014 , congress passed a stopgap plan on july 31 , 2014 to prevent a funding lapse . 
  [ 10 ]  as of 2015 , despite a sharp drop in gas prices , strong resistance remained by both the american public and congress to raising the gas tax . 
  [ 11 ] if a rich nation like the us , for whom driving is * extremely important * , ca n't be bothered to pay literally a few cents per 3,8 l to fix their roads , which are visibly falling apart , then imagine how difficult it is for a country like greece to push through one measure after another that will hit people 's incomes or ( worse ) protected job status . 
  can we downvote individual protesters as well when they say stupid things ? 
  do you honestly think that germane and france wanted this ? 
  that they would n't have preferred an at least modestly financially healthy greece that did n't need bailouts ? 
  these ious should have a name . 
  `` iou '' sounds weird . 
  just a suggestion : maybe `` drachme '' would be a good name for them . 
  it 's 2am and i 'm tired , so i 'm not going into full essay-mode , i just wanted to let you know that i disagree with you that : - i think greece can be saved from bankruptcy with the current plan and proper reforms - i do n't think that the rest of the people at the negotiating table ( it was n't just germany and greece ) such as our dutch pm , would have essentially thrown away billions upon billions of euros of tax payers money , just so slightly delay the inevitable and bail out * non-dutch * ( german ) banks . 
  - i think you 're ironically not being very sympathetic to the greeks , since their belt would have been tightened anyway , but this is less of a pile of shit than they would have been in had they gone bankrupt . 
  just my thoughts though , not claiming them to be phd-level insights or facts . 
  what you 're describing is essentially bankruptcy . 
  do you wish we had let greece go bankrupt ? 
  i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to come across as such . 
  i was just annoyed by the weird `` money goes to the banks when you pay off your debt '' thing , which i do n't understand why people keep repeating it . 
  really though , i 'm mostly relieved that there 's an agreement that might give a way out that does n't cause greece to go bankrupt , not kick them out of the ez . 
  they 're free to say no to the proposition and go bankrupt instead . 
   is this also their fault that the market decides somehow that in 2008 greece is a safe borrower and two years later they are terrible ? 
  yes . 
  this was n't caused by people treating them unfairly , it was by their own overspending .
