  if anything , the rates should have gone up * before * 2008 . 
   also , if the ecb did the job of lender of last resort from the start then the greeks would not need this bailout package at all . 
  if they had lower interest rates , but the same ballooning overspending , then they still would have needed a bailout at some point . 
  remember , the ecb is n't there to lend money at cheap rates because they want a buddy to save some money compared to the free market lenders . 
  they 're lending * to save a country from bankruptcy * . 
  more importantly : you 've not addressed the single point of my comment : the money going from the ecb/ez `` to the banks '' is a bullshit argument that people need to stop repeating . 
  as stated : it 's like blaming the baker for taking a poor man 's money ( when selling him a bread ) . 
  yes , but * how many * nukes do you need for that ? 
  accumulating nukes ( or not reducing them ) is something irrational that i 'd expect from russia , not from nato countries . 
   90 % of the money over the past 5 years went directly into the pockets of the banks please stop saying this . 
  this actually infuriates me because of how bullshit it is . 
  not that it is n't * technically * right , but it 's totally irrelevant !, 
  we helped greece pay off loans that cost them 15-20 % interest , so that now they only pay 3 % interest . 
  that is very much a favour * to greece !, 
  * but yes , if you help someone pay off their debt , or take over the debt ( same thing , really ) , then the original money lender gets their money back . 
  that does not mean that you 've somehow simply left greece in the cold and just helped the banks !, 
  if you give a poor man a few dollars , and he goes and buys some cheap canned foods from walmart with that money , does that make it ok to angrily say : `` all that money has gone straight into the pockets of a large corporation instead of to that man ! '' ? 
  no , you 've helped that man out , walmart is just doing business like it normally does . 
  likewise with the banks . 
  they are just doing business like normal ( lending money to countries with interest rates based on the rating for that country ) , we did n't help them , we helped * greece * . 
  some people would argue that those two provinces together * could * be called holland , but i 've never actually seen anybody do it ( not counting crazy limburgers ) , since generally ( i 'm generalizing a lot here ) people realize that if they do use `` holland '' in that way , it 'll cause confusion due to people assuming you 're talking about the entire country instead . 
  it 's like using the term `` americans '' for mexicans ( due to them being from the continent of north-america ) during conversation . 
  i understand if someone argues that you * could * , but nobody actually would , since it would just cause confusion , regardless of whether it 's technically correct . 
  interesting little sidebit : * technically * you could call mexico `` the us '' as well , since their official name is the `` united mexican states '' ( estados unidos mexicanos ) . 
  fortunately , nobody does , though . 
  i understand and respect your opinion , but would you agree that if someone uses that word to refer to the country , that in general , everybody knows what they 're saying and most people do n't feel the need to contradict that person in great lengths ? 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong , of course , i 'm just wondering whether i need to pick a different metaphor for explaining holland/netherlands . 
  to be fair , nordrhein-westfalen already has mountains , for dutch standards , anyway . 
  it 's amazing how very quickly after i cross the border driving east , the ground suddenly does weird things , like ... not being flat . 
  like , not flat at all . 
  very strange indeed . 
   pretty much like bavaria minus the tasty beer . 
  as someone who lives in the city where they brew grolsch , i find this offensive . 
  having lots of variation of beer , does n't make it good beer . 
  did you know that some germans mix their beer with cola ?!, 
  ( also , do n't they have mountains in bavaria ? ), 
  hehe yeah , especially if , for example , you confuse a welshman or a scot with `` english '' which is not particularly appreciated . 
   literally `` turn gypsies to soap '' which refers to a nazi practice of using human fats to produce soap just for the record : that is a commonly heard rumour , but not actually true . 
  maybe a single nazi once did a retarded experiment ( i think even that is not true ) but the rumour that is was done on an industrial scale has been proven investigated and deemed not true . 
  good point . 
  no matter how much i pretend to be offended , that insult just makes me giggle . 
  i honestly do n't understand why some people here on reddit seem to be concerned with holland/netherlands nomenclature . 
  in my personal experience , in real-life i 've only heard people from limburg complain about this , and it seems to be some sort of way of distinguishing * them * from * hollanders * , which is their name for people from the randstad . 
  from large cities in the western part of the country , not necessarily from south/north holland , since e.g. 
  people in utrecht are also considered `` hollanders '' . 
  it 's some weird pet peeve where they want to distinguish themselves from a different part of the country . 
  weird as that is , if they want to do that , fine . 
  but what i do n't understand is why they then bother non-dutch people with this stuff . 
  internationally , holland is simply a nickname for the netherlands . 
  oh , i know and agree . 
  that 's one of the reasons why `` america '' as a nickname for the country is fine : it 's not ambiguous . 
  the same for holland : we have provinces called `` south holland '' and `` north holland '' but not formally an area called `` holland '' unless you interpret it to be those two combined . 
  that 's why it 's not ambiguous : there 's no actual area that officially has the name `` holland '' . 
  hence my preference for using this analogy . 
  yeah , that sucks . 
  but i guess that 's the price for living well outside your means for over a decade and then ( through such agreements ) still being considered a modern and reliable country , instead of a corrupt country that does n't repay its debts . 
  do n't get me wrong , it sucks for greece either way , but if you compare the economic measures to the levels they were at before the gdp suddenly started massively ballooning around the turn of the century , then that seems quite manageable and fair . 
  and for the political stuff , let 's just hope that at least it helps them get rid of corruption better and quicker , having an independent arbiter look over their shoulders than if their own elected officials have to be persuaded by the populace to fix corruption . 
  plenty of times . 
  [ another example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzozuhywpms ) . 
  that man is * not * talking about two specific provinces . 
  edit : another silly example : the albert heijn mentions `` holland '' as country of origin on dutch veggies/fruits . 
  i 'm expecting most of those measures ( higher vat , lower pensions , less people employed by the government ) will also be necessary if they exit the ez and default on ( a large part of ) the outstanding debt . 
  simply because they wo n't have money to keep up the status-quo . 
  however , if the spending power of the pensions are decimated because of a devalued drachme , then they wo n't be able to point the finger to us . 
  now , the politicians can point to the eu ( and germany in particular ) as a scapegoat for forcing measures that were needed anyway . 
  i was disagreeing with your statement that -- why am i even answering you ? 
  your swearing using `` cancer '' shows that you 're either an illiterate moron , or a 12-year-old . 
  or both . 
  we 're not a huge country , and we 're doing just fine . 
  you do realize that the official dutch tourism site is `` www.holland.com '' and that the king will be shouting `` holland ! '', 
  at sports events , not `` netherlands ! '', 
  ( ... and tons of other examples that i 'm too lazy to type out ) please stop giving non-dutch redditors the impression that this is an important distinction . 
  do n't worry , it 's only pedantic neckbeards that complain about `` holland . '', 
  normal , regular dutch people are fine with the term . 
  kind of like how you call your country `` america '' even though that 's technically a continent , not the name of your country . 
  but everybody knows what you mean , and people generally do n't mind about it being technically incorrect . 
  that 's kind of how the term `` holland '' is viewed . 
  except for an abnormally high number of dutch redditors for some reason , and some self-loathing weirdos from a [ fringe province ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limburg_%28netherlands%29 ) on the outskirts of the country . 
  they see `` holland ( er ) '' as a term for `` people from the netherlands , who are not from our province . '', 
  wait , did this turn into a civ5 discussion ? 
  you watch your mouth , buddy !, 
  we , the dutch are not part of germania !, 
  at least not for about ~ 2000 years . 
  how many millennia must we be independent before people stop comparing us to the also-pretty-good-but-slightly-less-awesome-than-us germans ? 
  proposed terms ? 
  spending 3 % interest on a loan that they can take effectively forever to pay back ? 
  meanwhile the eu insisting that they reduce overspending from the past ~ 10 years to sensible levels ( huge gov ' t apparatus , pensions , etc ) and end corruption ? 
  that 's not a bad deal . 
  besides , if they leave the eu , and find that nobody will lend them money for less than 15 % interest , they 'll soon find that the old ways ( that the eu told them to give up ) are very unsustainable even without the eu telling them so . 
  indeed , and let 's not forget that they gave up some of these rights * voluntarily * and are free to reclaim them if they wish . 
  they traded in a part of their sovereignty , if you will , for benefits of cooperation . 
  they can start printing drachmes , effectively leave the ez and do other such things that are being now prevented by the deal with the eu , * but * that means that they lose benefits that they get from the cooperation and likely get into severe financial problems immediately . 
  worse than they are now . 
  most dutch people consider `` holland '' fine and often enough use the term ourselves . 
  yes , * you * . 
  and although i would n't mind if people that were so anti-eu would simply piss off , if the uk does a brexit , then that would also fuck over the millions upon millions of brits that * do * think rationally about such things , or simply were misinformed by sensationalist tabloids and only realized afterwards how fucked they 'd be . 
   not leave it up to some eu bureaucrat to decide ` what is best for us ' the ep is more democratic than your own parliament where ~ 35 % of the people voted for the country that decides 100 % of the policy for the next few years . 
  and the important , impactful things are not decided by `` some bureaucrat '' but by the leaders of the countries , where the uk has a much bigger hammer than most eu countries . 
   like when they deposed a democratically elected greek leader last year because he did n't fit their agenda .
