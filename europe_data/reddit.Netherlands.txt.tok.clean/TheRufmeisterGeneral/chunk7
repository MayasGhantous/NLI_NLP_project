  really ? 
  this is complete nonsense . 
  are you going to accuse the eu of euromaidan next ? 
  the articles you linked talk about `` hundreds '' of people . 
  while you have ~ 10 million of non-uk-born people in the uk . 
  why do you care about this ? 
  this has zero impact on your life . 
  nor on any significant statistic for the uk . 
  no administrative system is 100 % perfect , but people whose job it is are working on improving such systems . 
  that 's their job . 
  are you also interested in other parts of the uk 's administrative apparatus , where some weird rule means that a few hundred more people from the uk get treated differently than how you instinctively feel they should ? 
  perhaps an issue about a parking regulation in birmingham ? 
   we have organised international criminal gangs exploiting this free movement policy and massive increases in crime in city centres directly due to it  i think this is a priority in the short term where as reducing immigration in general is more of a long term goal , along with building more houses , not something that can be done overnight , like scrapping these ridiculous laws . 
  can you specify which laws ? 
  oh , and also : ** you will not scrap/reduce free movement of people within the eu ** . 
  not now , not next year , not in ten years . 
  it 's not a matter of choosing a number of people for whom it 's ok . 
  it 's a 100 % fundamental principle on which the eu is founded . 
  you guys should know , you were there . 
  it 's not possible to `` reduce '' this or scrap it . 
  and if the uk honestly tries it anyway , to somehow `` negotiate it in '' under the guise of avoiding a brexit ( hoping for a repeat of the scotland referendum , where scotland got a much better deal , to convince them to stay ) , then i honestly hope we kick you ungrateful little fuckers out . 
  as the future progresses , most people move towards more international cooperation , freedom and friendship . 
  it 's sad that certain political factions ( and tabloids ) seem hellbent on convincing the people of the uk that this is not good for them , that it 's much more important to them to keep reminding themselves of what a unique snowflake the uk is , than to do what is best for its people and the country . 
   it is not completely different , many of the asylum seekers we are accept who are criminals avoid deportation due to ridiculous eu human rights laws and therefore we have to pay for a house for them to live in , i.e they rape or stab someone then claim their right to a family life and we pay for it . 
  just no . 
  where have you heard this nonsense ? 
   we get to choose who comes from non-eu countries so it is n't as bad and often those who get in are highly skilled no . 
  you have 7 + million immigrants from outside the eu . 
  those are not 7 million highly skilled workers . 
  if it were , your labor market would be * way more * fucked up , because it would be impossible for your white , anglo-saxon college graduates to find a job . 
   also we have historical ties with a lot of former colonies so we have special trade and migration agreements with them ( commonwealth ) which i think is a good thing as they tend to integrate more into our society . 
  really ? 
  you complain about the job and housing market , but then not mind the 7 + million immigrants , but go after the 3 + million immigrants , just because you `` ca n't control '' who comes in ? 
  this sounds like the job and housing markets are just excuses , and it 's just about power . 
  it 's about control . 
  it 's about sovereignty . 
  it 's about wanting to decide everything yourself as the uk , even if the decisions being taken at the eu level are good for you . 
  that does n't make you wise or principled , that makes you fucking childish . 
  the uk is not a separate continent , you are not an island halfway across the atlantic . 
  you are part of europe , which you are * hugely * benefiting from . 
  start appreciating that , you ungrateful , whiny little shits . 
  please do n't equate asylum seekers with ( especially eu ) immigrants . 
  those are * completely different * . 
  even if you were n't part of eu , you 'd still be morally obligated to accept people who fled their country because of their lives being in danger . 
  the figure of `` hundreds of thousands per year '' seems a tad silly . 
  it 's been around 200k/yr making that just barely technically correct ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_immigration_to_the_united_kingdom ) , [ gov.uk ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/august-2014/stb-msqr-august-2014.html ) ) , more importantly though : the total of people in your country that are born elsewhere in the eu is 3.6 % of your population . 
  if * that * causes your housing and job markets to go out of whack , then you were already having problems before the eu influence . 
  try building more houses . 
  a much larger amount of immigrants ( more than twice that amount ) are from non-eu countries . 
  which i suspect is , for a large part , from your former colonies . 
  so ... do n't have such a colonial past ? 
  is that a useful tip ? 
  to be honest though , considering how incredibly common and cheap indian curries are in the uk , and how ** fucking awesome ** they are , you should n't be too sad about that . 
  i wish i could get a curry from a nearby place for a few quid . 
  but i ca n't , since we only had indonesia and suriname ( etc ) in our colonial past , where some nice people are from , but whose culinary prowess pales in comparison to india . 
  gypsies are an eu-wide problem , and less of a problem in the uk , due to you guys not being part of shengen . 
  being annoyed at gypsies and then blaming `` immigration '' in general is very , very stupid . 
  also , are you sure gypsies can claim benefits ? 
  i 've read somewhere that you need to be a proper resident of the uk for a while before you 're allowed access to benefits . 
  just relocating to the uk and then claiming benefits does n't work . 
  that does n't dispute my remark about them being gypsies , not immigrants . 
  immigrants move to a place , get a house and a job , and try to contribute to society . 
  gypsies ... well ... do n't . 
   ( that 's a memorial they were caught using as a toilet . ), 
  haha , that has * nothing * to do with immigration !, 
  those are gypsies , or homeless people or some other troubled group . 
  poles who want to work in the uk do n't take their suitcase to a memorial to shit there , obviously . 
   it might mean economic drag and immigrants to people in the uk the immigrants to the uk have a net positive effect , financially speaking . 
  the biggest ( if not only ) problem with immigrants from the eu , is xenophobic populist shits like ukip , worrying that ... 
  i do n't know what worries them ... that their culture is diluted ? 
  this is not the place for childish sarcasm . 
  that 's probably a fair assumption . 
  he 's mentioned in a podcast that he does n't care much for politics in general , it 's specifically election systems that he finds interesting . 
  piss off , please . 
   national parliaments have the unquestioning legitimacy of the overwhelming majority of that nations people i dont mean to be pedantic , but currently , approximately 100 % of the legislative power in the uk is in the hands of * one * party , which 37 % of the people voted for . 
  cgpgrey video on the topic : https://www.reddit.com/r/cgpgrey/comments/3a23po/why_the_uk_election_results_are_the_worst_in/ i have more faith in eu politics than uk politics . 
  it depends on which employees you ask as well . 
  as a former student , i was * very happy * to find work in the weekends or evenings that i could do besides my studies . 
  there is * very little * work available in those hours and stores opening on sundays would be a massive boon for people like students that * want * to work outside of office hours . 
  please disregard above comment . 
  the netherlands is a founding member of the eu , is massive internationally oriented , has one of the largest harbours in the world , has its people speaking more foreign languages than any nearby country , has several huge international banks , etc , etc. 
  ** the netherlands will absolutely not leave the eu . 
  ** only populist/far-right morons would even suggest that . 
  i believe your first comment in this thread would be the cause . 
  a reminder :  treasonous thinking , imo . 
  is that what you 'd tell your countrymen as their organs are torn to shred by gunfire ? 
  is that what you 'd tell your fellow europeans as they 're being decapitated ? 
  `` just ignore them , your heart will restart the second you ignore them ! '', 
  you ignore it , because you 're not affected . 
  what about your people who are ? 
  a citizen who is ignoring the danger of terrorism is treasonous . 
  a terrorist 's goal is not to kill people , it 's to spread terror . 
  hence the name . 
  if you are scared because of terrorists , then they 've achieved their raison d'\u00eatre . 
  it also does n't help an average person * in any way * to be scared of terrorists . 
  this is n't rocket science , dumbass . 
  also : `` feeling solidarity with ones people '' has nothing to do with whether you 're scared of terrorists or not . 
  are you saying that communism solves terrorism ? 
  because no , it does n't . 
  you 're not surprised that e.g.
