  brazilians are not annoyed that americans ( see , there it goes ) claim the name `` america '' for their country when discussing it ? 
  since technically , brazilians also live in america , the continent . 
  as said before , i live in enschede , further away from north - or south-holland than zeeland , and yet i have no problem with my country being called holland ( e.g. 
  by germans who visit here all the time ) or me as `` hollandisch '' . 
  i would however be * very * offended if someone called me a german . 
  / u/schurkjeboefje was n't talking about how their behaviour was caused by the colour of their skin or by the religion they consider themselves part of . 
  he was talking about * the country * of somalia , which currently is a fucking mess . 
  it 's a combination of lawlessness , tribal rule , part-cult-part-terrorists rule , and all factions are rife with corruption and shitty treatment of people in general and women in particular . 
  people from such an environment are more likely to have a shitty bunch of norms and mores compared to someone raised in a modern , structured , corruption-free ( relatively ) country like a western european country . 
  in such a comparison of countries , again , it 's irrelevant what the skin colour or ethnicity is . 
  hence , no racism . 
  was that you specifically ? 
  yeah , i remember you misunderstanding the american analogy back then as well . 
  one last attempt : `` america '' officially means the continent . 
  it 's being used for just the country usa . 
  everybody knows what 's intended when people say `` america '' . 
  as you can tell , it 's still a pet peeve of mine , apparently of yours as well . 
  i do n't think we 're going to agree at some point . 
  america is a name of a continent . 
  it is simply ignorant to call one single country that . 
  the point of the analogy : even if a region has an * official * name and a basis in history , does n't mean that 's what the word means today in common parlance . 
  `` holland '' does n't * have * an official meaning . 
  only `` south-holland '' and `` north-holland '' do . 
  * nobody * who is n't using your limburg-specific slang will understand `` holland '' to be only those two provinces . 
  holland is a * de facto * name of the country . 
  holland.com is the official tourism site , not just for the two provinces . 
  `` ik hou van holland '' is about the whole country , not just the two provinces . 
  `` hup holland hup '' is about the dutch team , not a team for just the two provinces . 
  do you need more ? 
  using the term `` holland '' for anything other than the country is either old-fashioned or disingenuous . 
  edit : or both . 
  ah , that makes sense . 
  i think you 're grossly oversimplifying things but yeah , american foreign policy has been quite bad for a while . 
  these days , though , it 's much better than it was 20 or 40 years ago . 
  in general though , i do n't think a lot of policy was `` malicious '' ( if you do n't mind me translating your silly `` satan '' sentiment to that ) but mostly naivety and short-sightedness . 
  it 's actually typically american in terms of politics . 
  a lot of the stuff about american society is decided by knee-jerk responses , gut emotions and short-term thinking , instead of simply wondering what is best for society . 
  take health care , for example . 
  if you could simply * poof * have the british nhs system in place instead of the current system in place ( have hospitals structured like in the uk , doctors relative salaries like they are in the uk , taxes and prices structured like in the uk , everything ) , it would mean that you have : - ** the same ** amount of tax money spent as in the old us system - everybody would have health coverage - nobody would * have to * pay for health insurance through private companies - people could still * choose to * pay for private insurance , if they want faster treatment ( not many people in the uk do this , the nhs is quite good , but for the ( super ) rich , it makes sense ) - it would save a huuuuge amount of money the us currently loses in lost productivity from people not getting medical attention in time or at all . 
  including people who let shit fester/escalate before they decide to see a doctor - it would save a huuuuge amount of personal bankruptcies that currently occur due to health costs - it would save a huuuuge amount of misery for people who go bankrupt or have ( preventable ) medical hardships - it would give americans the ** freedom ** to switch or quit jobs when they want to , without worrying about health care see [ graph ] ( http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/health-costs-how-the-us-compares-with-other-countries/ ) for information on public ( tax ) money spent on health care . 
  instead of seeing this larger picture , the us insists on not-wanting to implement changes because of transition cost , or perceived loss of freedom ( people bitching at * having to * get insurance under obamacare ) . 
  similarly with education : anything above high school is obscenely expensive in the us , because people do n't want to `` pay for someone else 's ride '' while not realizing that subsidizing higher education is a huge net benefit to society because of the higher output of work of a higher level and associated benefits and taxes . 
  foreign policy has been equally short-sighted . 
  regimes that were oppressive to their people but friendly to the us were kept in place or helped because it seemed nice to have a friend in the region , without realizing that fucking citizenry of a country over like that is in the long run and in the bigger picture much more costly than the benefits of a regime in one country being friendlier to you . 
  edit : sorry for ranting , i actually like the us ( except for its fucked up health care ) , lived there in the past , but the way its politics seem to fuck over both its people and common sense are a pet peeve of mine . 
   my point is those who decided we were going to sell guns and fight proxies for the last 40 years have made the me even worse than it was after ww1 what do you mean by `` me '' ? 
  edit : i think it 's `` middle east '' . 
  it 's that , is n't it ? 
  that is such a stupid limburgian thing to say !, 
  holland is * the country * . 
  you are part of holland . 
  you are talking about how the media favours the * randstad * , i assume ? 
  and , it makes sense . 
  most people live there . 
  the largest cities are there . 
  media and government focus on large cities more often than on fringes of the country . 
  most of all the capitol . 
  besides that , the area where media companies are centered ( hilversum in nl , la in the us ) as well . 
  people who live in a small/medium sized town in north-holland ( e.g. 
  enkhuizen ) have just as much right to feel underrepresented as someone from limburg . 
  * more so * than someone from maastricht . 
  rotterdam is the second largest city in the country and is vitally important for the country , with its large population , huge harbour , excellent infrastructure and massive amount of business . 
  but do you know how much media attention rotterdam gets compared to amsterdam ? 
  however , that does n't turn people from rotterdam into whiny little bitches , complaining about how `` holland-centric '' the politics and media are ( using your same definition of `` holland-centric '' meaning : the whole country , except for where i live , and some other places nobody , including me , cares about ) . 
  i live in enschede , which is also devoid of interest from media and politics . 
  we were esctatic when a few years ago , the glass house from 3fm was here , because we were relevant for once . 
  however , we do n't hate holland because of it and turn into whiny little bitches . 
  i realize that using dutch words properly is n't a strong suit of the average limburger but please realize that `` holland '' , `` hollander '' and `` hollandcentrism '' are ** local slang ** restricted in use to limburg ( and some other exceptions , like small pockets of zeeland ) and are not in use with the same meaning in the rest of the country , nor in english . 
  please do n't confuse english readers by using words that have a commonly-understood meaning like `` holland '' and instead assigning your limburg-specific slang meaning to them . 
  holland is a country . 
  you are part of it . 
  you might be over-thinking this . 
  a guy who was annoyed muttered an observation to himself , which noone around him at the time could understand . 
  give it a rest . 
  if i were to locate a stowaway in a closet in my place of business , i 'd tell them what they wanted to hear in order for them to leave as quickly and calmly as possible . 
  at the same time , i would also probably be annoyed , like this guy is . 
  a tad more civil perhaps , but that does n't change the situation much . 
  he did n't cause problems , he did n't disadvantage them , he did n't do anything immoral , he did n't insult them ( at least as far as they know ) . 
  what is your problem with this guy ? 
  i understand the notion of trying to help these people , but that should be voluntary and without * making their problems your own * . 
  if he would have told them they were in the netherlands and given them a glimmer of hope that he would help them , they 'd latched on to him and they 'd be * very * difficult to get rid off . 
  i have good news for you : it is n't . 
  he does not say `` niggers '' or anything with a meaning even closely resembling that . 
  why not ? 
  i 'm not defending him or anything , just out of curiosity . 
  he works in logistics . 
  these people are not his problem . 
  he wants to do his job . 
  they are in the eu . 
  the can fairly easily ( thanks to shengen ) travel to most eu countries . 
  they can ask for asylum in the netherlands or in any other shengen country they wish to travel to . 
  this man is not their keeper or responsible for them . 
  it seems he just figured that this way was the quickest way for them to go away , leave him alone , so he could continue doing his job . 
  the `` calling him blacks '' is something they could n't understand anyway , he muttered it to himself because he was annoyed . 
  he 's not even wrong or using a non-pc term anyway . 
  and i do n't see where he 's `` acting like a hero '' at all . 
  whenever they try to thank him , he 's just like : `` yeah yeah , just go away '' . 
  he seemed annoyed in general , he did n't seem to specifically emphasize their colour or act differently because of it . 
  he might as well have said `` stomme wijven '' ( stupid chicks ) out of annoyance , which would n't have made him `` misogynistic as fuck '' . 
  you do realize that as an eu citizen , you 're free to live and work in belgium , if you do n't like the country you currently live in , right ?
