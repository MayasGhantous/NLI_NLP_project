  i 'm not telling you to piss off or anything , i 'm just being helpful . 
  thanks for confirming stereotypes . 
  speaking of stereotypes : holland is the name of the whole country , making you a hollander as well !, 
  could n't we do the opposite ? 
  give limburg to belgium ? 
  only if wilders is part of the package , of course . 
  why a gay person should have the same rights as a straight person ? 
  are you seriously asking that ? 
  or are you asking why a chicken should not have the same rights as a person ? 
  both are equally stupid questions . 
  a gay person should have the same rights as a straight person . 
  a * chicken * should * not * have the same rights as a straight person . 
  this is not rocket science . 
  those are emotional issues . 
  and i reckon they 're based off of which movies you 've seen recently or something similar . 
  however , * every single day * i benefit from the very real and quantifiable practical advantages of the euro , how in a split-second , using just a glance , i know exactly which bills i have in my wallet . 
  on the other hand , an american does n't know * jack shit * until he folds over and looks on the corner of * every single bill * . 
  i 've lived in the us for a bit , and initially , it 's very cool . 
  it feels very `` movie-ish '' but it gets very annoying , very quickly . 
  especially if you 've handled practical , usable money before . 
  this makes sense . 
   more specifically , maybe he was talking about national central banks having control instead of the ecb . 
  now now , be nice . 
  the poor man deserves our sympathy . 
  it 's got ta be hard having cartoon money for your everyday stuff . 
  well , that problem would be fixed if you guys adopt the euro as well . 
  the euro is not a german currency . 
  and the euro has done a huge amount of good for us . 
  as a small nation with a huge port and lots of international trade , and a lot of export , it 's a * huge * boon to use the same currency as most of the rest of europe , as opposed to some small , unknown currency that only 15m people in the entire world use . 
  to give all that up ( or pass on it ) just because you 'd be more comfortable if our politicians have more `` control '' over it , seems stupid . 
   until cash is either completely fazed out wo n't happen . 
  not for a long , * long * time !, 
  for context : i 'm an it guy , i like the digital stuff . 
  also , i remember people saying that in the 90s , when pin/maestro became ubiquitous as a form of payment . 
  and again , when the `` chipknip '' would replace cash . 
  it 's just * not * gon na happen for a long , long time . 
  is a sheep technically a vegetable ? 
  maybe after you hit it on the head ? 
  haha , those are * old * guilder designs !, 
  i 'm fairly sure that only the flower one was still in use in 2001 , the others had been gone for years . 
  so , even if we had n't gone to the euro , you still would n't have those bills anymore anyway . 
  i hear that german caf\u00e9s have better bratwurst than french ones , though . 
  personally , i do n't mind this ( although it felt a tad weird at first , since guilder ( \u0192 ) notes were roughly the same size ) . 
  it helps differentiate easily between $ 5 and $ 20 notes , which are * not * the same colour ( green and blue , iirc ) but in a rush or in semi-dark , the colour can be similar enough that the size difference is nice . 
  i reckon the americans have it especially rough , where the $ 1 is the same size and colour as the $ 100 . 
  did that * really * happen though ? 
  people here have been complaining about that too , but objective studies have shown it to be mostly bullshit . 
  directly after january of 2002 , most prices rose * slightly * , mostly due to rounding off , but since then , it 's been mostly normal inflation . 
  the exception was prices of drinks in bars . 
  those have risen notably since the euro , for some reason . 
  my parents will sometimes complain about it as well , but then i have to remind them that they 're comparing 2015 prices to 2001 prices . 
  * everybody * 's money is colourful . 
  globally , that 's a fairly universal thing . 
  makes practical sense as well . 
  there 's only one big exception that i know ... oooh , i should have checked your flair before answering . 
  sorry , dude . 
  i think putin cares more about whether russia is intact than whether someone else 's city is turned to shit . 
  if russia invades lithuania , and nato forces scramble to remove russian military from lithuania , you expect that will cause russia to deploy nukes ? 
  do you seriously expect that ? 
  that he would level a large part of the world , at the very least moscow , because he 'd stand to lose a bit of land * outside of russia * ? 
  i think not . 
  i 'm not suggesting that anybody should identify themselves as a fan of the french president . 
  i was merely discussing what names our country is commonly known as . 
  did you not see the comment you 're replying to ? 
  the country is known by ** both ** names . 
  one of which is the official name , the other is an extremely common nickname , common enough that ** everybody ** understands it to mean the country . 
  except limburgers , who are known to speak in a derogatory fashion about the rest of the country , who use `` hollander '' as slang to mean `` non-limburger dutch '' . 
  that 's why whenever you speak of `` holland-centric '' you 're not talking about the two provinces , you 're talking about the center of the country , where all the important cities are . 
  when you are talking about `` holland , '' what you * really * mean is `` randstad . '', 
  the argument is : there 's an official full name of a country ( in the example `` the united states of america '' ) and there 's common nicknames of that ( `` america '' ) which are * technically * not correct , but everybody nonetheless knows what you 're talking about . 
  the * country * is called holland . 
  - ** official , full name : the netherlands ** - ** nickname : holland ** this is not too complicated for you , right ? 
  if you live in limburg , then you * are * a hollander , because you live in holland . 
  unless you somehow feel that limburg should n't be part of the country . 
  and i hate how people who live in the rural fringes somehow see `` holland '' as meaning the same as `` the part of the country that is unlike my local rural subculture '' . 
  for me , having grown up around utrecht/gelderland ( urban middle of the country ) but now living in enschede ( outlying part of holland , but * definitely * identifies as `` holland '' ) it also makes no sense , what you 're saying . 
  but better get used to how those terms are used . 
  your beef is just as silly as someone who goes to the us and lectures people there that `` the us '' is not their name , since mexico is also officially called `` the united states of mexico '' which is just as `` us '' as the united states of america '' ... or that `` america '' is a continent , not a country . 
  nobody will care . 
  holland is the common nickname of the country and the * origin * of that name lies in the two provinces . 
  tl ; dr ** you are a hollander !, 
  so , you dislike people from hilversum , but amersfoort is ok ? 
  how does that make sense ? 
  also , you 're weird for making that differentiation , i 've not heard a fellow dutchman use `` holland '' as a term for provinces other than the country itself , since i got out of primary education . 
   dutch people hate holland too for a large part can you explain that ? 
  this makes no sense to me . 
  most dutch people i know do n't hate their own country . 
  which of those prices include sales tax and/or vat ? 
  america has the weird habit of not including sales tax in their prices , yet in the uk , all prices as publicized towards consumer include ~ 20 percent vat . 
  if you deduct 20 % from the left column , then suddenly those prices are very similar . 
  similar enough that for most items , it 's within the range of currency fluctuations . 
  that webpage is hugely oversimplifying a huge treaty that has tons of implications about lots and lots of different areas of business and trade . 
  it 's not just about `` making it illegal to use different prices '' . 
  finally !, 
  this is completely useless . 
  yes , lots of fairly rational people think that ttip is bad , but since the g7 summits have been annoyed by violence-seeking * anarchists * every damn time for the past few decades , nobody is going to find these guys interesting , regardless of their message * this year * . 
  it 's probably more productive to write/phone your meps with your concern about ttip than to angrily shout stuff at police near a g7 summit . 
  \u00bf que pasta ? 
   politics-wise we need relaxation . 
  punish russia economically whenever they exacerbate the situation in ukraine further .
