well , that 's an interesting way to invade a country ... ( i jest , i 've been to russia and leaving the country to be the russian dream for many of the students ), 
  but he does speak russian , so at least he can yell at putin in his own language . 
  if the southern countries stop bitching about it ... 
  good ol' drug tourism . 
  true . 
  there are also plenty of parents who send their kids to school in belgium if they live close to the border . 
  [ the town in question ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baarle-hertog ), 
  dutch people sometimes go to belgium or germany for cheaper gas and beer . 
  make as many competitors as possible leave , so you 'll earn more money . 
  / u/beck2012 might have been referring to this :  lithuanian ( lietuvi\u0173 kalba ) is the official state language of lithuania and is recognized as one of the official languages of the european union . 
  there are about 3.2 [ citation needed ] million native lithuanian speakers in lithuania and about 200,000 abroad . 
  lithuanian is a baltic language , closely related to latvian , although they are not mutually intelligible . 
  it is written in a latin alphabet . 
  the lithuanian language is often said to be the most conservative living indo-european language , retaining many features of proto-indo-european now lost in other indo-european languages . 
   the macedonians ( macedonian : \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0438 ; transliterated : makedonci ) -- also referred to as slav macedonians or macedonian slavs [ 35 ] -- are a south slavic ethnic group who are primarily associated with the republic of macedonia . 
  they speak the macedonian language , a south slavic language . 
  about two thirds of all ethnic macedonians live in the republic of macedonia and there are also communities in a number of other countries . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29 ), 
  only 10 % of the people living in crimea speak ukrainian as their native language , compared to 77 % who speak russian . 
  though the fraction of people living in crimea who are russian has decreased since the collapse of the usr , they 're still the largest group of people there . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimea#demographics ) ), 
  yes , and in 1783 a large part of the us still belonged to the spanish . 
  my point is that in the minds of many russians , crimea should never have become a part of ukraine after the ussr collapsed . 
  crimea was gifted by kruschev ( a ukrainian ) to ukraine in the 1950 's as a sign of friendship . 
  they kept the area when the ussr collapsed . 
  many russians do n't agree with this , and believe crimea rightfully belongs to russia . 
  putin 's popularity has increased , many russians support his actions . 
  how many people have died climbing that star ? 
   catching method : fell of a truck . 
  yes , muslims really like that name . 
  that worked * so * well in with the mujahideen in afghanistan . 
  the american propaganda machine is n't nearly as good . 
  the netherlands is densely populated and its terrain is very flat , so i think it 's relatively cheaper to maintain and upgrade the network here . 
  many ( if not all ) nodes are already connected by fiber , which is advertised as fiber in some countries . 
  you know what this means . 
  today flanders , tomorrow the world !, 
  the man truly is a shithead . 
  i dunno , i think there 's a difference between going somewhere to take your own pictures of the procession and watching ( and taking screenshots of ) press coverage . 
  i did n't mind most of the people watching , because a lot of them were visibly shaken . 
  the people taking pictures , though ... ordinary disaster tourists . 
  i took screenshots from [ this livestream ] ( http://www.npo.nl/live/nederland-1 ), 
  `` i was looking for a parachute and i found the body of a little girl '', 
  well , duh . 
  she 's for a more united europe , not a more divided one . 
  you seem to value conforming to the rest of society a lot . 
  though that 's not homophobia , it * is * intolerance of others based on their behaviour . 
  you 're basically saying it 's wrong to say that being gay is okay . 
  equating homsexuals who enjoy the parades with pedophilia is simply disgusting and wrong ; there 's a huge difference between a child 's sexual choices and an adult 's . 
  if you do n't enjoy the parades , do n't pay attention to them , but do n't be intolerant of people who do . 
  europeans are homes ? 
  when are they ` spreading ' homosexuality ? 
  when men are holding hands ? 
  when they kiss ? 
  when they are happy because they can be themselves ? 
  the only reason those pride parades bring ` shame ' is due to your intolerance . 
  it 's interesting to see comments saying this is good are being downvoted , are other european subreddits currently dealing with an influx of eurosceptics ? 
  i 've seen several of them in / r/thenetherlands lately . 
  oh , my sweet summer child . 
  no , because you need someone for the ceremonial tasks . 
   corrupcy , * corruption , 
  it was pretty certain for serveral years that this would happen, 
  no , people assumed he was a muslim without any proof . 
  now we have proof . 
  you must be a fun person to hang out with ... 
  that 's a pretty normal way to talk about your country . 
  people will also talk about how * they * are performing in the world cup soon , because they identify with their country . 
  saying we should stop saying something , because nationalism plays a part in many european issues wo n't work . 
  ignoring something generally does n't make it go away . 
  chernobyl despite the fact that the ukrainian government had decided no tourists would be allowed to visit that year . 
  the politician is a member of the pvv as well, 
  hooray , we 're turning into the us and australia !, 
  you get a voting pass with your name , they only check if your name in your passport matches the one on your voting pass . 
  *** `` double voting is weird situation '' *** minister plasterk calls it a `` strange situation '' that people with two european nationalities can cast their vote twice . 
  he reacts to the news that thousands of europeans of two countries have a voting pass . 
  the minister pointed out that voting twice is prohibited . 
  `` it is not allowed . 
  you can get one month 's imprisonment and be fined 4,000 euros , '' he says . 
  `` what really needs to happen is that those two european countries coordinate that only one form will be sent , for example , by the country in which the person resides . '', 
  plasterk has already proposed this to his european colleagues , but others found it too complicated , according to him . 
  ** secret ** people caught vote twice is indeed very difficult . 
  `` it is simply a secret whether you vote . '', 
  plasterk will raise the issue again in brussels . 
  psh , with your * non * - indo european language . 
  if an article is almost a year old , how can i know if the data is still relevant ? 
  not even 1100 people took part in the survey , either , i seem to remember that even in the netherlands you need at least 1800 responses for a trustworthy result . 
  there 's plenty of dissent in areas like economics between different researchers . 
  it 's a social science people are applying mathematics to . 
  in any case , you clearly do n't understand how politics works . 
  first of all , each member of the tk has his or her own specialization , they spend most of their time working on crime , technology , the environment , etcetera . 
  if politicians need information on a subject , they have plenty of advisers and assistants , people are invited to give explanations , there 's the wetenschappelijke raad ( scientific council ) , the list goes on . 
  but in the end , there 's plenty of smart people from a similar background who disagree with each other in matters of this background !, 
  diederik samsom and i are both physicists , i disagree with him on nuclear power , for example . 
  politics is slow because people disagree , which is normal for the complex and varied problems politicians have to deal with . 
  changing the system so other people will have to make the choices wo n't change a thing , solutions wo n't be optimal because people have different opinions , morals , dreams and goals . 
  okay , so , to who are we going to listen if we stop listening to the people . 
  who is smart , people with high iqs ? 
  what of you strongly disagree with them on most matters simply due to your ideology ? 
  shouting fuck democracy is dumb , we 'll have the same problems with other systems . 
  communism looms well on paper , until you try it out in real life and some group takes over . 
  at least we 're not working as serfs anymore .
