  i think that 's strangely beautiful , actually . 
  i 'm living in melbourne now and the netherlands are actually pretty cheap in comparison :p depends on your lifestyle if you can live there for $ 1000 a month , though . 
  do n't worry about it . 
  you should read my comment with a wink , i occasionally like to troll people . 
  but that 's not my point . 
  my point is about performing a completely unnecessary medical procedure , hence the comparison with removing the appendix without a good reason . 
  yes , fgm is much worse , but that does n't mean mgm should be acceptable because it is n't as bad . 
  * throw * than are you sure you 're english . . ? 
  conservative-only administration ? 
  he 's confusing it with populist-only administration ... 
  you 're welcome . 
  i 'm sure they have the other $ 492 bln lying around somewhere , though, 
  2 * 10 ^ 9 , not 20 ^ 9 ( which is 2 ^ 9 * 10 ^ 9 = 512 * 10 ^ 9 ) . 
  i completely agree . 
  i 've never understood why we see female circumcision on religious grounds as horrible mutilation , while male circumcision on the same reason is perfectly acceptable . 
  we do n't remove the appendix without a good reason , either . 
  that 's [ professor crook ] ( http://uacg.bg/?p=182&amp;id=37&amp;f=1&amp;l=2 ) for you !, 
  yup . 
  my parents live in the area , my dad 's a doctor . 
  a few weeks ago he clearly vented his frustration after someone had called because * several * of her children had gotten the measles ... 
  because there still are too many people who think there 's something wrong with homosexuality . 
  but only if you 're white and still distantly christian . 
  good , it 's nonsense that i have to pay more when i 'm using vodafone 's network when outside of the country . 
  beatrix abdicated earlier this year , smartass . 
  i guess his point is that not every joke needs to be dissected . 
  netherlands : [ ziggo ] ( http://www.ziggo.nl ) 150/15 $ 42,00 unfortunately , it 's a cable company who now force new subscribers to also take a digital television and landline telephone subscription for 60 . 
  they 're trying to make is switch , too . 
  scumbags . 
  so , i 've been thinking . 
  growing up , my parents always told me not to use the sink in the toilet . 
  nobody i know really washes his ( or her ) hands after going to the toilet , either , except when it 's a larger bathroom with multiple stalls and people * will * frown upon not washing your hands . 
  maybe we 're just a very unhygenic country when at home , with decorative sinks in the toilet . 
  well , do you really need warm water to wash your hands ? 
  edit : also , in toilet sinks in restaurants , theaters , and the like , the water is usually lukewarm . 
  the only place i 've ever seen just a cold water faucet here are toilets, 
  just replace the faucets with a single mixing faucet , you 'll never want anything different again . 
  * he 's not paying ? 
  well , ask him nicely again !, 
  oh , you . 
  there 's a big note in english and dutch ( and recently , also spanish ) on the emergency exit , so that one does . 
  you 're right about the others , though , they 're just general frustrations . 
  no shit , life 's * very * harsh in russia . 
  i 've been there a few years ago on an academic tour , on the average it seems that russian people dream of being able to ` get out . ', 
  ever visited / r/news , / r/politics , / r/worldnews or / r/worldpolitics ? 
  half of the top comments in those subs are explanations why the title and/or article is wrong . 
   but not as bad as the people from spain . 
  my experience with spanish erasmus students is the worst of all ... no , the emergency exit should not be used without an emergency . 
  no , you can not smoke weed in the faculty smoking room . 
  no , you can not steal the glasses from the faculty pub . 
  etc. . . 
  i googled seehofer corollary , the top result :  why 13 percent of germans would welcome a ` f\u00fchrer ' - csmonitor, 
  you write greece ( in greek ) in the latin alphabet as ellada . 
  if japan were in the list , it would have been sorted under ` n. ', 
   never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity, 
  it was a fake belly , they just stole a baby from the hospital . 
  damn royal immunity . 
  especially in italy . 
   the italian senate is unusual among european upper houses in that it has almost the same power as its lower counterpart . 
  any law can be initiated in either house , and must be approved in the same form by both houses . 
  additionally , a government must have the consent of both to remain in office ( a position which is known as `` perfect bicameralism '' ) . 
  nieuwspoort in the netherlands . 
  's \u00f6r ' seems to be rather close to ` cerveza ' , or is that just a coincidence ? 
  yes , but the wiki-article gave me the idea that using mandate 's sixth definition , in a political context , in english is incorrect . 
   in some languages , a ` mandate ' can mean a parliamentary seat won in an election rather than the electoral victory itself . 
  such as in french , but not english . 
  if ww3 is inevitable , there is a reason why it will happen . 
  `` ww3 is necessary/inevitable for reason x '' mean the same thing . 
  necessary implies that it can not be avoided ( is going to happen anyway ) , which is exactly what / u/aggrosan is saying . 
  you really should check the dictionary http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/necessary, 
  seriously , read more than one sentence on the website . 
  here 's the definition of necessary the page gives :  main entry : necessary  part of speech : adjective  definition : inevitable you 're still saying the same thing . 
  [ once again , synonyms ] ( http://thesaurus.com/browse/unavoidable ), 
  [ they 're synonyms ] ( http://thesaurus.com/browse/unavoidable ), 
  yeah , you did . 
   the earlier it starts , the earlier it 's over with . 
  does n't look like that to me . 
  first he says we should arrest someone with diplomatic immunity , then implies that ww3 is necessary . 
  that 's not a joke , that 's just being an idiot . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  no , they better not . 
  unless you want to jumpstart ww3 . 
  us government 's official reply : whatevs , look at our pile of wmd 's and state-of-the-art shield . 
  when they find out , just say that you do n't understand internet speeds . 
  that 's weird , i do n't have any problems with either link . 
  in any case , liveleak has the same movie as op shared , but also provides links to the articles in my comment without using google translate ( which i think might be the problem ) .

  really ? 
  i 'm honestly expecting that the same shit would have gone down with a republican president . 
  ironically , americans also suffer at the belligerence of republican terrorists . 
  do n't forget many providers already operate internationally , like t-mobile and vodafone . 
  ah , it 's always the obvious . 
  thanks !, 
  yes , different nations and cultures being intertwined to form a strong union . 
  i wonder what the meaning three differently-coloured stripes is in the logo . 
  i agree , i really like how they portray the different aspects of their country in the pictures , but always feature grass . 
  people , business , nature , europe and a national identity all in one ( or twelve , depending on how you look at it ), 
  reminds me of south park 's funnybot-episode :  it 's been two weeks now since the prestigious voters of the comedy awards reversed their vote and said germans were no longer the least funny people in the world . 
  all thanks to the new ground-breaking german comedian , funnybot . 
  [ stock footage is shown of things being assembled ] it was after being voted the least funny people on the planet that the germans first engineered funnybot , a super automaton with perfect timing to within .0001 milliseconds . 
  since then , funnybot has seen a meteoric rise to stardom , selling out standup theaters all over the world .
