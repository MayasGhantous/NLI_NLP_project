  it 's easy to discuss morality with hindsight , it 's more difficult when the lives and well-being of your friends and family are involved . 
  even better . 
  you can in the netherlands , but there is much less information given . 
  there are also plans of censoring the broadcast further or completely . 
  ha , it 's a small world . 
  but , this means that the most senior mod is an american as well . 
  it 's not that this is necessarily a problem , though some of the rage seems to be directed at davidreiss666 not being a european . 
  / u/jeresig / u/kitestramuort / u/raerth / u/theskynet / u/span12 / u/gschizas / u/bezbojnicul these mods could remove him . 
  yeah , but it 's like calling all spaniards catalonians ... 
  as a dutchman , it always annoys me a little when people talk about holland , but they mean the netherands . 
  considering that his mom is jewish , does n't that make him jewish almost by default ? 
  i thought you were talking to pegasus_527 . 
  ehm , maastricht is a dutch city, 
  so every bonobo is mentally ill ? 
  [ close to 1500 species of animals disagree ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homosexual_behavior_in_animals ), 
  someone 's repressing his feelings ... 
  well , germany is doing relatively well at the moment ... i 'll think about it . 
  they can have limburg in any case . 
  but it 's the graph with data from 2010 , does the data still apply to 2013 ? 
  i ca n't really be bothered to skim a 143-page report right now . 
  `` in many countries sexual abuse by the church has been thoroughly investigated , but not in poland . 
  the country loved its own pope many years , and this love for the polish pope john paul made the debate impossible . '' `` john paul ii was convinced that you should handle these things discreetly . 
  now we know that this stance has led to crimes committed by priests . 
  they committed them without punishment . 
  you could accuse them and they could not be deposed because those cases took years . 
  the perpetrator was protected , instead of the victim . '' `` vincent sziemansky has returned to his hometown , zakroczym . 
  he tries to start a conversation with former fellow villagers about the priest who abused him . '' `` so tell me , the priest ? '' `` yes , i remember him . 
  he was like this and that . '' `` listen , have you ever heard the priest was a pedophile ? '' `` he loved boys , huh ? '' `` yes , yes . '' `` you were abused ? 
  is it a problem if a priest strokes a child 's head ? '' `` i have my own children ! '' `` you acolytes ... you wanted to blackmail the priest ! '' `` we ? '' `` the entire village supports me . 
  you 're selling nonsense ! '' `` so something * was * happening . '' `` you were a deceiver and you were scumbags ! '' `` so we blackmailed the priest ? 
  why ? '' `` because you were young and stupid ! '' `` what the ? 
  me , blackmailing a priest ? '' `` stop , the people agree with me . '' `` that single priest ? '' `` you 're selling nonsense !, 
  everyone thinks you 're an idiot , the stuff you write on the internet . 
  normal people say you 're a pervert . '' `` yes ? '' `` yes , what do you even want ? 
  what do you even want ? '' `` to tell the truth . '' `` how old are you ? '' `` i 'm 58 years old . '' `` that 's 58 years * too * old , then . '' `` victims of sexual abuse by priests in poland still stand alone . 
  there is a first small hint of light at the end of the tunnel , when a polish weekly magazine wrote , for the first time , about the three victims this week whom you 've just seen . 
  for poland , this is unique . 
  it 's finished . 
  i will have made some small errors , but i think i got a pretty nice translation . 
  if something 's not clear , please ask . 
  the second part can be found in a reply to this post . 
  `` a leaving pope benedict called it the blackest page of his tenure , the abuse of children in the roman catholic church . 
  but , there is one country where the abuse is completely denied , which is in poland , a catholic nation where people do n't want to believe that the religious rape children , talking about it is taboo . 
  victims who do talk , are castigated by their neighbourhood . 
  the roles are still reversed ; the abusers enjoy the safety of the church and the victims must keep silent , which they almost all do . 
  `` `` you were abused ? 
  is it a problem if a priest strokes a child 's head ? '' `` i have my own children ! '' `` you acolytes ... you wanted to blackmail the priest ! '' `` vincent sziemansky ( sp ? ), 
  was abused in his hometown zakroczym ; the priest had abused multiple children , though nobody believed it . 
  it was quite the opposite ... '' `` the official version ( of the people ) was that we , the acolytes of zakroczym , noticed the weakness of the priest and abused it . 
  thus , it looked as if we , boys aged 12 , 13 , 15 had raped the priest !, 
  it was horrible , i had to flee . 
  fleeing , fleeing , do you know what that means ? 
  to where ? 
  under communist rule . 
  there was nowhere to go ! '' `` in the end , sziemansky accomplishes fleeing poland , he moves in canada and is currently the owner of a website offering help to polish victims of sexual abuse by priests . 
  using his data , sziemansky estimates that at least 15.000 people have been abused using his data . 
  the church wants to know about nothing . '' `` we speak with a few cases . 
  do not forget that it is always a moral question . 
  you do not make these known to the public . 
  the only thing i can say is that a few cases are currently known . 
  i think that the deeply rooted faith of the polish is an important element . 
  despite the amazement of the west that only so very few cases are known here , it is the truth nevertheless . 
  because faith is much stronger here than in countries as the netherlands , belgium and germany . '' `` in oh-so catholic poland priest are highly esteemed , people simply do n't want to believe that they abuse children . 
  not even in the rare case that a priest is convicted for sexual abuse such as here in tilama ( sp ? ), 
  in the south-east of poland . '' `` it 's impossible that it 's true . 
  he was so good to the children . 
  the children loved him . 
  if he really had done something , they would n't have loved him . 
  or not ? 
  he was innocent . '' `` he truly was a good priest . 
  he was n't materialistic at all . 
  that they accused him of sexual abuse is not believable . '' `` tilama 's priest als rapes ewa orlowska ( sp ? ) . 
  eva is one of the few who dares to testify against the priest to the fury of her fellow villagers . '' `` the priest has been convicted , end of story ! '' `` is that all you have to say ? '' `` yes ! '' `` thank you . '' `` you 're looking for money , you wo n't get it . 
  you do n't have a case . '' `` you want money yourself . '' `` eva learns during the lawsuit that priest also abuses her daughters . '' `` he could do whatever he wanted . 
  parents and teachers allowed it . 
  if a child suffered from a headache , a priest would visit . 
  because he had healing powers . 
  he healed them by putting a hand under their clothes during sunday school * with everybody else present . 
  ten years later , it seems that the priest is now seen as the victim . 
  and we can , sorry to put it in these words , go fuck ourselves . 
  in the end the church always wins . '' `` you can keep silent for a long time , ban the images to the bottom of your memory and wonder who was guilty , you can ask god ... '' `` the polish artist kora was abused by a priest . '' `` of course there are many people who hate me because i made it public . 
  how can you do that ? 
  they 'll immediately tell you that the priest is only human too who can make errors . 
  okay , but every error must have consequences . 
  nothing is worse than doing that to a child . '' `` also wojtek petrewic is a victim of sexual abuse , years later he looks for the priest who raped him and finds out where he works . '' `` i still want to hear : ` i 'm sorry . ' i want to see his reaction when we see each other again . 
  jesus , they 're still sleeping . 
  '' `` hello ? '' `` is the priest here ? '' `` he 's not there . '' `` it 's something personal , where is he ? '' `` he 'll be back after the holidays . '' `` i 've been looking for this priest , and finally found him in this parish . 
  i know he 's a priest here ; they keep him hidden from me , they have even sent him to germany for a month . 
  but i know he has returned now . 
  as long as i have the strength and as long as i live , i will keep looking for him . 
  until we meet again , eye-to-eye . '', 
  i 'll see if i have some free time tonight or tomorrow , but i think i will . 
  watch the movie , then . 
  it 's a major issue . 
  i was watching tv a few days ago , a show about catholiscism in poland . 
  when young boys were raped by a priest , the children were punished by the townspeople because they had clearly raped the holy man ; priests do n't rape . 
  poland has some serious human rights issues to work on edit : i found the episode online , http://www.klokk.nl/?p=12778 . 
  if it 's not working i can post a summary or a translation of the dutch subtitles and spoken parts soon . 
  edit 2 : i 'm currently translating . 
  no offense , many germans have agreed with me on this , but germans often are extremely punctual and the law is the law , no discussion possible .
