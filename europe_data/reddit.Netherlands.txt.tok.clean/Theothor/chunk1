that was more like reglueing a country . 
  this map has nothing to do with `` putting up with islamic bullshit '' .

  that 's an awesome view . 
  nice skyline . 
  [ scandinavia is the name that a region in the north of europe is indicated . 
  the term scandinavia is defined in three different ways  ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavi%c3%ab ) [ 1 pure geographically scandinavia is the area that is equivalent to the scandinavian peninsula , which for the ost part consists of the scandinavian highlands . 
  this concerns the countries of norway and sweden and parts of northern finland . 
  ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavi%c3%ab ) [ 2 politically scandinavia consists of denmark , norway and sweden . 
  this is the definition used in scandinavia itself and one can on the basis of this definition argue that the nordic part of '' norden '' ( see third definition ) . 
  ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavi%c3%ab ) [ 3 historically and culturally scandinavia consists of member states of the nordic council : denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden . 
  in danish , norwegian and swedish , this is referred to as `` norden '' and in finnish as `` pohjoismaat '' . 
  ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavi%c3%ab ) [ typically , the second or the third definition is used . 
  ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavi%c3%ab ), 
  why are you not surprised ? 
  why ? 
  do they not fall under food manufacturer ? 
  infographics are not allowed there . 
  hmmmm , our definition of scandinavia includes finland and iceland . 
  does that mean i hate finland even more ? 
  scandinavia + netherlands masterrace .

  can i also choose half a country ? 
  he speaks 5 languages including russian . 
  he 's really a great foreign minister in my opinion . 
  i would guess hundreds of years ago we used `` bek '' to refer to a `` beak '' , but over time it changed meaning a bit . 
  and they still ranked it 11th of 26 ? 
  who says they are anti gay ? 
  nobody is saying it 's against the rules . 
  did you forget that they absolved a huge part of their debt ? 
  there is a big difference between populair opinion and the term `` hive mind '' though . 
  it implies that they are just mindlessly upvoting an opinion and the people who are not part of the `` hive mind '' are some kind of independent thinkers . 
  do n't forget the luxembourgers . 
  oh never mind , who am i kidding . 
  yeah , because a mod ca n't just remove this post ... 
  because you think the plan is to eradicate and massacre the protesters . 
  did n't the russians also partake in the talks ? 
  what do people think of tymoshenko ? 
  does she have a big change in the coming elections ?

  the other countries obviously . 
  father and daughter by micha\u00ebl dudok de wit . 
  i do n't know if it best describes my country , but if i think it 's a beautiful little film . 
  [ you can watch in on youtube , it 's only 8 minutes . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7auw1wsmzw ), 
   the only difference is that the nazis had a scapegoat based on ethicity , and communists one on income level . 
  that 's a pretty big difference if you ask me . 
  i do n't agree that western european countries look at communism with rose-tinted glasses . 
  just that they make a distinction between communism and stalinism . 
  sorry for the people downvoting you without replying . 
  let me start by saying that communism and nazism are radically different things by definition . 
  nazism is a fascist idealogy which incorporates racism and antisemitism . 
  communism advocated a classless system where everything belongs to the community where there is no privately own property . 
  if you are a nazi , you are a bad guy by definition . 
  if you are a communist , you are not . 
  then there is the connotation that both symbols carry . 
  the swastika is only a symbol of negativity everywhere ( apart from a few asian buddist groups ) . 
  there is only a connotation with the atrocities in the second world war . 
  it is a bit more complicated with the hammer and sickle . 
  in a few eastern european countries it has the same connotation , but in a lot of other it is very different . 
  in russia it 's also a symbol of them being a world power , of being space explorers etc. 
  i understand that you might think it 's bullshit , but the symbol is a big part of their history . 
  lastly i think it is important to note that they were showing their history starting from the northern war . 
  it would be odd to not include a symbol that represents 80 years of their history . 
  good or bad . 
  you 're concerned about a history lesson ? 
  calling something retarded does n't really help your case . 
  was n't gernika a tiny village ? 
  does n't really compare to the bombings in the second world war . 
  hey yaix , have a look at last years news . 
  they did . 
  it seems that both cases are pretty terrible . 
  obviously . 
  ... nothing, 
  and then you all sit in one big circle drinking coffee and eating cake . 
  great pictures , did you also happen to find some nice places in the netherlands ? 
  how have we been exceptionally nice these couple of months ? 
  yes , thank you . 
  not drink it ? 
  yeah probably . 
  no i 'm not . 
  what does a missing floor mean ? 
  it 's hard to judge without a picture . 
  the guy did n't say someone broke into his room , it might have been a maid . 
  the woman said the water was restored and yellow . 
  because i only see a picture of putin , an open door does not mean broken into , the water was restored so yellow water can come trough the first few minutes when a pipe was broken . 
  my point is that only showing five photos of unfinished details tell you a very one sided story . 
  it may very well be that there is just one hotel that is not finished . 
  judging sochi on five photos is not fair i think . 
  i showed the pictures that i could find of our olympic team . 
  why would anyone take a photo of a finished toilet , a closed door or running water ? 
  wow , the same five pictures . 
  thanks a lot . 
   these photos show a bunch of bog-standard developing-country architecture , a lot of folding chairs in a cafeteria which may or may not serve food and potable water , and , wow , a parking lot . 
  and op 's photos show a door , a curtain , and , wow , three lightbulbs ... 
  mostly american or british . 
  my point was more that the american media would get the worst rooms .
