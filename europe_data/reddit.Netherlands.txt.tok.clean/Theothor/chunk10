  this is mostly referring to things mods do to `` correct the voting '' either by removing the downvote or hiding the points . 
  i strongly dislike both options . 
  putting a caption on the downvote button might help without intervening too much . 
  i have know idea why this is relevant in this thread , but you seem like a bit of a dick . 
  i do n't know it it would accomplish anything , but i do n't see why not . 
  i just downvoted you for not having a tl : dr  good comments sometimes get downvoted , but to call it a `` downvote culture '' is a bit much . 
  to be fair , nujij is competing with youtube for worst comments on the internet . 
   along the lines of `` hey look at him , what a retard ! '' . 
  i ca n't say i see that sentiment often , it 's more along the line of `` do you not know how great the eu is ? 
  you 're pretty ignorant . '', 
  i guess it depends on how you interpret those comments . 
  i could n't remember the last time we discussed the eu here so i looked it up . 
  [ why is this subreddit way more pro-eu than real life ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1p2s7q/why_is_this_subreddit_way_more_proeu_than_real/ ) top comments :  21/6 i mean , you might love the eu and wake up every morning in praying to the eu flag , but one still , from an economical standpoint , has to admit that the euro has big flaws ( who may or may not be fixed , btw , depending on your faith in the eu i guess ) . 
  but , it seems like to most pro eu people those big flaws seems like speedbumps that can be fixed with a little tweaking . 
   53/12 i 'm a eurosceptic and i joined r/europe precisely because i wanted to see alternative viewpoints and also to put my own points across and see how they fare . 
  from my perspective many of the pro-european arguments are made from the point of naive optimism about how the eu should work than the mundane reality of how it does work . 
  let 's say it is youthful optimism which is present in this subreddit . 
  [ would you want a federal eu ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ca55w/would_you_want_a_federal_eu/ ) top comments :  33/3 not with how it 's constructed now . 
   36/16 a powerful eu would also intervene to protect its own interests , do n't kid yourself . 
  here 's why i will be voting to * stay in * the union if/when the referendum comes . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/16zgox/im_a_eurosceptic_heres_why_i_will_be_voting_to/ ) +190 let 's say it is not as black and white as you make it seem . 
  edit : how could i miss your comment in said thread : / u/neredev  [ 14/3 exactly , when i talk about europe with other young people , they often have no other arguments than `` but i have faith in the eu '' or `` but i believe the eu is good '' ; and when you expose your points it 's just `` meh , i disagree '' or `` are you racist ? '' . 
  most of the time it 's just blind faith forced into our brains by the medias .

  i agree , i thought he meant that he did n't comment because he was afraid that he would be downvoted . 
  welcome to reddit . 
  you should n't care about karma . 
  hiding downvote button does n't work . 
  mods should intervene as little as possible . 
  edit : also , have you seen the downvoted comments ? 
  they do n't make any sense . 
  one guy posts his comment four times . 
  two say the crowd is small and one says they want to immigrate to germany ? 
  there is not one sensible anti-europe comment . 
  you started so well . 
  between the streetlights there are indeed the same amount of people . 
  in the right picture the people extent past the streetlights though . 
   i 'd like to add that the photos could have been taken at different times of the protests , meaning perhaps not everyone had arrived when these pictures were taken . 
  i agree , this picture in itself does n't say anything . 
  what makes greece so special ? 
  greece , luxembourg , austria , slovenia and serbia will be added in the future . 
  let 's also not pretend like it has nothing to do with qualifications . 
  may i ask why ? 
  chaudfontaine is $ 0.75 for 1.5 litre . 
  where do you shop ? 
  i really like this idea . 
   i like the idea , but i fear you will have to put a lot more effort in to it before it becomes more than a nice idea from a loving husband . 
  does it need to be ? 
  does it help that i only know it from fawlty towers and not from some meme ? 
  you 're the one who mentioned the war . 
  do n't mention the war . 
  but without the punchline my comment is n't true ... :(, 
  i assume you do n't know who bernd holzenbein is ? 
  what happened half a century ago is a dark chapter in our history . 
  i still remember vividly how my grandpa would get so hateful when i asked him about that time . 
  to this day a lot of people still have a certain hate for the germans . 
  even though i was n't alive back then i still have a bit of hate in me . 
  the english `` armoured '' does n't have a secondairy meaning i think . 
  the dutch `` geharnast '' does : http://nl.wiktionary.org/wiki/geharnast, 
  `` armoured '' is n't really the right translation for `` geharnast '' . 
  belligerent would be a better translation i think . 
  he warns for europhiles who think everything the eu does is correct and who will fight to defend all the actions of the eu . 
  not physically of course . 
  so , yes ? 
  is there such a thing as hating people who speak a certain language ? 
  like anti-indo-europeanism ? 
  antisemitism refers to hatred against jews . 
  even though technically it refers to semitic people it is not used in this way . 
  is it weird that i have never knowingly met a jew ? 
  am i missing some jew radar or something ? 
  not sure if serious or never seen a globe . 
  mountains ? 
  i ca n't help but think the media is making an elephant out of a mosquito . 
  connecting a few incidents that have nothing to do with each other . 
  i highly doubt putin gives a damn about all of this . 
  we use `` nog '' for `` yet '' , `` even '' , '' another '' or `` still '' . 
  just like you use '' \u00e4nnu '' . 
  if google translate is correct `` nog '' means '' \u00e4nnu '' in swedish . 
  looking at the examples i would say that 's correct . 
  we use it in the exact same way . 
  still ? 
  another ? 
  we do n't have that many excemptions . 
  yeah i think you 're right . 
  18.1 % of our income comes from labour tax . 
  why does it say the netherlands has a labour tax of 18.1 % ? 
  last time i checked it was 37 % and higher . 
  what about them ? 
  yes , that 's what i mean . 
  you ca n't buy a 5000w one in regular stores just like you would n't be able to buy a 2000w one with these new rules . 
  i just found out i 'm having two discussions with the same person . 
  but for most products it does n't work that way . 
  you are not gon na use a 500w vacuum cleaner twice as much as a 100w one . 
   you just simply can not limit the amount of resources used by banning devices with certain power consumption . 
  well , you can .
