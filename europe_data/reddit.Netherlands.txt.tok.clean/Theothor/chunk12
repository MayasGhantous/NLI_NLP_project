  it is . 
  it 's an other word for `` bediende '' . 
  if her point was that zwarte piet originated from a time during slavery , than yes , she is correct . 
  i do n't know what the relevance is though . 
  he has never been a slave in any of his stories . 
  that `` blackface '' is just as racist as a `` whiteface '' . 
  we do not live in the 30s , nor do we live in the states . 
  we dress up as the character zwarte piet , not as a black person doing monkey tricks . 
  even though there are probably some racists in the pvv , i would n't call it a `` racist party '' . 
  sure . 
  she 's going to come to our country to `` investigate '' the issue with three other people ... 
  seriously , how does a person like that get a job at the un ? 
  from everything she said , she much have done zero research about it and only based her opinion on a complaint she received . 
  also a nice quote : `` we do n't go around saying all white people look like this or all white people look like that . 
  we do n't do that , we do n't do that . '', 
  what an idiot . 
  [ or do they ? 
  what the hell is testpiet testing ? 
  have . . to ... resist ... making ... belgian ... joke ...

  relevant : [ `` to prevent any discussion i left black pete at home and brought a bunch of poles '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q27pxvv.jpg ), 
  but is n't ? 
  how is my comment an attempt to shut down any discussion ? 
  i do n't think only saying the line has any grounds . 
  it shuts down any discussion without addressing the issue . 
  ah , the old `` you 're not black so you ca n't judge racism '' argument . 
  i ca n't say the comment `` minorities . '', 
  was terribly helpful . 
  a conversation would have been nice . 
  is this your first time on the internet ? 
  if you are answering a question that is not directed at you , you are taking over that conversation . 
  like the conversation i had above here : shalli : `` that was quick '' yaix : `` what was quick ? '', 
  me : `` he means racism '' yaix : `` op was talking about culture , not race , no ? '', 
  normally someone answers that question . 
  and not with :  what so ? 
  you asked me why they 're being named ... did i miss something ? 
  yes , but that 's not what / u/shalli thought . 
  because they are minorities their culture should be exterminated ? 
  ( not the people ) being a minority is not the reason the guy asked for extermination . 
  a final solution ? 
  what do those cultures have to do with gypsy culture ? 
  he means racism . 
  i hope so . 
  it 's time to teach you guys a lesson , 
  it does n't really matter all that much . 
  i hope we 're in the same group as belgium . 
  that would be glorious . 
  the belgian is correct . 
  yes , also lots of pictures of the cards !, 
  sadly , no . 
  / u/blura has n't commented in a month . 
  girlfriends birthday was 3 week ago . 
  so either he 's documenting every card for a mega post or he 's an ass . 
  no , i was making a slave joke ... 
  yeah , i 've read that . 
  it 's weird how 50 million reported english ancestry in 1980 and only 25 million in 2010 . 
  i guess people went from english ancestry to american ancestry . 
  true , that was silly, 
  african emigrants ? 
  the us has more than 50 million people with english ancestry , but probably a lot more . 
  add another 50 million irish and it would n't be far apart . 
  if by fairly low you mean top 3 then sure . 
  approval or disapproval . 
  whatever floats your boat . 
  i was talking about a mini deathstar . 
  now that i think about it , gps would n't help much . 
  although hypothetically you could use gps to locate your target . 
  i wonder if you could aim a laser from space with cm ^ 2 accuracy . 
  how do you aim a hypothetical laserweapon ? 
  you aim with gps ? 
  laserweapons dude . 
  just think about it . 
  i do n't mean `` help !, 
  there 's a killer behind me !, 
  '' , but `` dude , i 'm lost , can you give me some directions ? 
  someone who needs your help ? 
  haha, 
  why not ? 
  no , he 's trading chocolate . 
  that sound delicious . 
  i ca n't believe i 've never seen that combination here . 
  what if / u/horg is a 90 year old german veteran ? 
  hmmm . 
  mostly people who think it 's ridiculous to personally apologize for a war fought 70 years ago is my guess . 
  you want another one from the netherlands ? 
  it 's a correct synonym , just not the technically correct name of the country . 
   and deny them all . 
  yes , but we 've been a bicycle country since forever . 
  if spaniards always bought much more cars than bicycles it could be because of the economy . 
  i 'm talking about crime . 
  i used quotations because they are third generation immigrants . 
  are we talking about / r/worldnews or / r/europe ? 
  what `` disgusted '' you in that subreddit ? 
  i do n't think it 's that bad to be honest . 
  there they 're their, 
  to be fair , we do have a lot of problems with `` immigrants '' . 
  4 is certainly true , though i 'm not entirely sure if that 's a good thing . 
  the fact that i have n't heard of any of those beers might show my level of expertise . 
  #netherlands ** most popular : ** heineken the beer experts will probably tell you it sucks balls , but i kind of like it . 
  ** the best one : ** hertog jan heineken with a taste .
