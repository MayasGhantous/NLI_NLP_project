  and to think people really live in pernis . 
  i hear ya , we made the same mistake ... 
  yeah i know , that 's why i said it . 
  it would have been better if you had used the maximum timelength from 1980 . 
  that 's much more interesting . 
  i expected you on the level of spain , not of the ukraine . 
  i was a bit surprised to see you grouped will eastern european countries . 
  well , rob a bank and enjoy that scenery . 
  those countries have been happier for decades . 
  the euro has n't changed that . 
  what 's up with portugal ? 
  but norway is beautiful ... 
  i am indeed . 
  making a connection between happiness and not having a euro is pretty silly is n't it . 
  * togo ( does n't use the euro ) * bewin ( does n't use the euro ) * burundi ( does n't use the euro ) * rwanda ( does n't use the euro ) coincidence ? 
  i was gon na say we are better at soccer , but then i remembered ... 
   a consensus was reached on the answers . 
  why would you want that ? 
  what makes you think that ? 
  what 's wrong with opinions ? 
  you really think they are backing those rebels ? 
  iirc they are or were pretty good at weightlifting . 
  i 'll send one from rotterdam , the netherlands to balance it out , 
  yeah they do random checks at the albert heijn . 
  i only do it when i have less than a dozen products though . 
  obviously the the government does n't think that . 
  i 'm talking about what you and i think . 
  i do love the self service beepers . 
  i mean like google having 2 billion dollars extra to invest in the us is not better then the us using the money in a war ? 
  but if it benefits companies , does n't it also benefit the country ? 
  closing letterbox companies will not harm any big company . 
  not even that but they are treaties that are signed by both countries . 
  i assume we can get some of that un money for this . 
  where does it mean that ? 
  the real winner deleted his comment : /, 
  who the fuck is downvoting these comments . 
  god dammit motherfucker . 
  should have known . 
  in dutch it 's `` hoerenjong '' . 
  motherfucking whore ? 
  yeah that 's what i meant , 
  or is it the other way around ? 
  yeah , seems to be an odd choice . 
  i think it looks a lot better . 
  why does it look horrible ? 
  and it looks a lot better . 
  well , that 's kind of the point of trading . 
  not a lot of colonists would say that . 
  and not all colonists stole , a whole lot was just trade . 
  i certainly do n't think the slavery is being downplayed . 
  a lot of people just think that it is part of history and should n't play any part in present day . 
  indonesia is a difficult subject . 
  the dutch military did some terrible things . 
  without downplaying the terrible things the military did , people should judge both parties though . 
  dammit . 
  well , i just bought a south korean phone from an american company through an english company who sells through a german company to have it delivered in the netherlands . 
  am i doing this right ? 
  i wanted to mention sambal , but you do n't want to hear about food . 
  ca n't wait to go to that new ground zero tourist attraction . 
  hope the lines are n't too long . 
  ok yeah having no sd card sucks a bit , but it was n't a must have feature for me . 
  bought the nexus 4 last week for $ 200 . 
  crazy price . 
  no their not . 
  so is the netherlands !, 
  translating it to `` german '' is n't really correct though and a bit misleading . 
  true . 
  we certainly are n't making it worse . 
  i really like the new architecture and lets be honest , we have to best skyline of the netherlands . 
  also , peanutbutter . 
  to illustrate . 
  we went from [ this ] ( http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7054/6860483282_92d4ee8bb5_z.jpg ) to [ this ] ( http://www.debedrijfsmakelaar.nl/content/images/2010/11/05/183474/1288961701.jpg ), 
  no , definitely the terrible post war architecture that replaced the old city centre . 
  it is of course understandable that they had to build cheap , but a lot of it looks sad . 
  there are of course a few beautiful exceptions . 
  yes quite a few are . 
  the [ `` witte huis '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4t5sbrv.jpg ) ( white house ) to the right in the middle . 
  the [ st. laurence church ] ( http://imgur.com/niwyhfz ) in the center . 
  the [ town hall ] ( http://i.imgur.com/skrigtt.jpg ) on the left . 
  i ca n't distinguish any other buildings i know . 
  if it was n't clear , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2ealfl0.jpg ) is why it looks sad . 
  ah man , [ this looks so sad . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t6ufszm.jpg ) as an architecture student from rotterdam this just breaks my heart . 
  we have a 5 working as a secretary , but that accent makes her a 7 . 
  latex/nude modeling ( feel free to do some research ) , though i personally first only knew her as a `` reporter '' . 
  ** netherlands ** * [ ancilla tillia ] ( http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs50/f/2009/309/c/8/polymorphe_by_ancillatilia.jpg ) accused [ gordon ] ( http://1.static.upcoming.nl/static/images/95f06ef862f3536c9abbdb8ec8924322_1358339342-12_gordon__list-noup.jpg ) of using to much coke . 
  ( yes , frontpage news here ), 
  i assume it is as unpleasant as hebrew is to me ? 
  why do you think dutch is the least loved ? 
  oldest ally in battle i guess . 
  haha . 
  how did you know ` kont '' ? 
  pretty sure that 's solely dutch . 
  i understand , but does it really matter that you know chemical weapons were used if you ca n't know who did it ? 
  so you 're saying it is pretty useless ? 
  did you read the article ? 
  i 'll give you a hint . 
  the project is called juice , jupiter icy moon explorer . 
  i do n't get it . 
  well , that 's pretty useless then .
