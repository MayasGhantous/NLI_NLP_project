  snoop , they do have banks in italy you know . 
  now you just need to drain lake bothnia . 
  free land !, 
  yeah i thought about thar but i thought you could n't filter in specific subreddits . 
  is n't the disadvantage of not having specific discussions about news articles bigger than the few small advantages that you will get ? 
  personally i think it would be better if you did this by adding `` immigration '' filters so that users can filter it if they want to . 
  i would love to use that . 
  this seems a bit restrictive . 
  yes , and the netherlands is called holland . 
   holland  ( \u02c8h\u0252l\u0259nd )  n  1 . 
  ( placename ) another name for the netherlands, 
  it 's a fact that we are called holland . 
  whether it 's the official name is another question . 
  we do not call the country holland because we think we are better . 
  we call it holland because foreign people call it holland . 
  it also had nothing to do with ignorance . 
  we are just not pedantic . 
   stormfront has started using this sub for recruitment . 
  lol . 
  `` they '' are the people who came up with calling it the `` zeuro '' . 
  calling the hypothetical southern euro a `` zeuro '' has some unfortunate connatations . 
  both for the dutch and english speakers . 
  informal name of a country , official name of a country ... 
  potato , potato . 
  yeah , the netherlands wants to avoid a grexit , but is ready for it if it happens . 
  i do n't think this is a big deal . 
  it 's information that may or may not be included in the definite trade agreement . 
  i 'm assuming in a trade agreement of this size there are thousands of different and conflicting documents . 
  which posts would that be ? 
  normally all post supporting ttip are downvoted mind you . 
  we will , when the countries will be voting on it . 
  i feel like this and the solar powered road are just for publicity and nothing else . 
  just to show that they are a `` green '' company . 
  in the end it does nothing to fundamentally change how we make roads . 
  it 's far too expensive , harder to recycle and solves problems we do not have . 
  like using plastic bottles to make a road . 
  yeah , it 's great if you have a mountain of plastic bottle that ca n't be used . 
  we are using it however , to make new plastic bottles . 
  instead of making a plastic bottle and recycling it a thousand times , we would be making a plastic bottle to put in the ground . 
  how is that greener ? 
  that claim came from the anp : http://www.hpdetijd.nl/nieuws/venezolaanse-marine-in-arubaanse-wateren/ http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/archief/article/detail/3705888/2014/07/30/venezolaanse-marine-in-arubaanse-wateren.dhtml, 
  their source is the chief prosecuter of aruba . 
  is this a better source for your liking ? 
  http://www.wsj.com/articles/aruba-says-venezuela-raised-military-pressure-on-it-1406594604 this article is made to recap what happened during the time of the hm17 disastre a year ago . 
  that 's why it 's in the mh17 section . 
  why not ? 
  it 's fine . 
  maybe it 's easier if you just comment in english . 
  that way other people can also join the discussion . 
  i do n't really understand how you can say that a 10 , 20 or 30 % reduction in transport costs does not really matter . 
  why do you think poland has so much more railroads ? 
  not to mention germany . 
  they did n't buy the company to fire everyone it it . 
  they bought it because they thought it could be a way to make the windows phone popular . 
  and in all fairness i think they made some very good phones . 
  they did n't become very popular though and because they are now losing money they have to cut jobs . 
  dutch `` greediness '' probably helps in this regard . 
  either i want the receipt so i can check if i 'm paying for bread i did n't get or i want the receipt because i might want to return it later on . 
  i do n't really see what the big deal is here . 
  he represents how a lot of people view the greek state at the moment . 
  is this the first time you 've seen a political cartoon ? 
  [ you were on to something though . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uaeqnjn.png ) not really a big deal here as everyone knows these cartoons are filled with stereotypes and caricatures . 
   here in the netherlands we do n't quite make the distinction you make between roma and romanians we do n't ? 
  here we call the accordion players `` zigeuners '' , not `` roemenen '' . 
  no one really knows . 
  a lot of things can happen . 
  the usa with luxemberg because that would be hilarious . 
  the 30 % was before the drop of 25 % . 
  / r/europe does n't insist on anything . 
  there are people against and in favor of ttip . 
  pensions has been a issue since the start . 
  greece spends nearly 30 % of their budget on pensions so yeah it 's one of the things that causes this crisis . 
  fixing an economy who spends too much by spending even more . 
  it 's so crazy it just might work ... 
  does this also work the other way around ? 
  because if it does we 've got some spending to do !, 
  obviously , we are currently after ww2 . 
   the problem with greece was that we tricked europe and we hided the deficit we had, 
   [ in germany , the average pension in 2013 was 760.43 euro , ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/06/26/eurostat-greek-pensions-average-e882/ ) you 've added the additional pensions that are paid for by the employer . 
  so what do you vote if you think you need both spending cuts and growth ? 
  germany only finished paying off their debt from ww1 a few years ago . 
  yeah , except the average european is `` lefter '' than the democratic party . 
  [ this graph though . 
   when they begin to grow and create employment then could be cut . 
  ideally this would happen , but the opposite can just as likely happen . 
  the eu gives greece 100 billion euros and promises to talk about reform after 5 years . 
  after 5 years the greece economy is still shit and requests an extra 100 billion . 
  10 years later the economy is finally doing well , but now almost 40 % of the people receive pensions . 
  75 % of the greece expenses go straight to pensions , debt has reached 1 trillion euros and people are still not willing to reform pensions because now even more families live of it . 
  i do n't really agree , countries who can easily pay for their debt do not `` need '' debt relief . 
   what they need is restructuration and investments . 
  i do n't think it is one or the other . 
  they need all of those things . 
  they need to reform their pensions , increase the retirement age , restructure their debt , debt relief and investments . 
  i think almost everyone agrees about this . 
  technically yes , legally no . 
  yeah we 're so happy you 're not gon na pay back the money you owe us . 
  ha ha . 
  what did i say that was n't correct ?
