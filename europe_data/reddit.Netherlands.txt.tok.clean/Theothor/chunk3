  haha , no i do n't know . 
  anyway : http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/nederland/article/detail/3586089/2014/01/29/kamer-wil-snel-openheid-over-kernwapens-in-nederland.dhtml, 
  i believe they are in the same boat as we are . 
  everyone knows they are there , but the governments ca n't tell about it because of agreements with the nato . 
  personally i think plasschaert is doing pretty well considering . 
  probably my second favorite minister . 
  [ also .

  ** netherlands ** * we 've been waiting for the survey results this past month . 
  we 're concerned something terrible has happened to the mods . 
  ... in their pursuit of stronger ties with the west . 
  the other people can suck it . 
  start from the south . 
  just so you know , giving 50 links makes it less likely that people will actually click on a link . 
  so , a russian flag next week ? 
  it 's not a sign of support for the riots , the ukrainian flag is neutral . 
  they earn that much because people do not follow the rules . 
  it 's pretty much their own fault . 
  the amount is also pretty average . 
  two can watch simultaneously . 
  really only $ 4 because you can add one extra user . 
  awesome , i got ta try that . 
  can you use media hint with a dutch netflix account ? 
  you are reading the title incorrectly . 
  they mean that corendon is a travel company and also the olympic team sponser . 
  why is it hypocritical ? 
  [ our opposition is also ready for war . 
  ] ( http://www.partyfortheanimals.nl/images/marianne-thieme-20120918-4.jpg ), 
  little did they know corendon is actually anti gay and are extraditing the gays out of the netherlands . 
  thought that was about netflix . 
  do n't you have to pay for usenet ? 
  also , the sky is still blue . 
  yes , is there is correct latin spelling ? 
  what does this mean ? 
  i thought janoekovitsj was the one who they wanted gone ? 
  judging by the picture , the eu is the devil and russia is jesus . 
  why does it need to be a state of emergency ? 
  i assume she can just call 911 for trespassing . 
  depends on who are occupying the ministry . 
  if they are a bunch of neo-nazis you can not expect them to listen to any opposition . 
  [ euromaidan megathread # 2 - all discussions and links regarding the protests in ukraine ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1w5eje/euromaidan_megathread_2_all_discussions_and_links/ ), 
  i will have snow over rain any day . 
  i understand what you 're saying . 
  i guess i assumes that when people say italy has a coffee culture that they meant coffee is part of they culture , not that coffee itself is a culture . 
  you guys do take coffee pretty seriously though . 
  an italian friend of mine nearly punched me in the face when i ordered a cappuccino after diner . 
  aleaume paturle and nico alary do n't sound very american . 
  i got ta have to disagree with you . 
  italy certainly has a coffee culture for instance . 
  in the same way as we have a cheese culture , like britain has a tea culture and germany has a beer culture . 
  culture does not only entail art , history or beliefs . 
  with `` new '' , do you mean almost [ two months ] ( http://www.independent.ie/world-news/russia-denies-holding-trade-talks-with-strifetorn-ukraine-29819446.html ) or what ? 
  how do i know which one has been awarded that title ? 
  or do you expect me to enter every boulangerie in town looking for a baker with a colored collar ? 
  seriously , why would you need to go to france for croissants . 
  every half capable bakery can make croissants . 
  same with ukraine then i guess ? 
   all countries in geographical europe , except for russia . 
  are you answering the `` who do you consider a european state ? '', 
  or the `` where should the eu stop expanding ? '', 
  question ? 
  so , pro-russian mafia ? 
  well they do get two results : http://www.ask.com/question/why-is-france-famous http://wiki.answers.com/q/why_is_france_famous?#slide=3, 
  i think they meant to type `` fabulous '' . 
  btw . 
  i also got [ `` famous '' . 
  yeah , they should have just borrowed a variation of the dutch `` kalkoen '' like the swedes and danish did . 
  edit : and norwegian, 
  mine were all the same except the netherlands and belgium . 
  welcome to europe . 
  you know there are racists outside of stormfront right ? 
   i get that everyone in this sub-reddit loves the eu and hates russia nope, 
  [ streisand effect much ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q5vp05z.jpg ) also , why only google ? 
  why do you think the eu would impact the catholic church in southern europe ? 
  you think atheism spreads quicker from northern europe because of the eu ? 
  pretty crazy . 
  some guy from oregon asks her in the comments to interview people and seconds later she start doing it . 
  and we can all follow it live . 
  incredible how things have changed this past decade . 
  a lot of people seem to confuse the two . 
   the western media ( and by extension , normal people including redditors ) have been predictably lazy and are representing this conflict as `` the people '' vs the government i do n't know what media you are talking about or if you read more then one thread here , but that is just not true at all . 
  guess i misread his comment . 
  i thought he meant that the western media were n't telling the correct story . 
   businessinsider.com, 
  if the internet goes down , which i doubt , it will very likely only happen in kiev . 
  i guess i used a different definition if `` nation '' . 
  `` the people vs the government '' makes it seem like there are no people who support the government . 
  in this case `` the people vs the government and the people '' would make more sense to me . 
  the people of ukraine do not form one `` nation '' . 
  the country is heavily divided , so to act like it is a simple case of `` the people '' vs `` the government '' is false and misleading . 
  nothing funny , just wrong . 
  i did n't say i was . 
  there are a lot of different sides to this story and only viewing it from the protesters perspective will not give you the entire story . 
  the more information you have from both sides , the better you are suited to make a well founded opinion . 
  you 're correct , though if you want to change government it makes sense to go to the capital and not some other city . 
  indeed , propaganda is rampant over there . 
  pretty dumb to aim a real looking paintball gun towards police . 
  i think it is important to get the entire picture . 
  shooting a beanbag at a shoe is nsfw ?
