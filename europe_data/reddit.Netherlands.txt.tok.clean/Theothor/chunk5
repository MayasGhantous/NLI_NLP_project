  it is a fact that american/african/asian masks look like that . 
  only ignorant people might think this is racist . 
  in this case i think white people can . 
  no that 's what i call dedication . 
  looking forward to it . 
  i agree , but calling them immigrants is not gon na help that . 
  if anything it is gon na hurt the integration of these people . 
  it does n't make you a member of it , but it surely does n't make you an immigrant if you do n't share the ethnic views and identity of the major populace . 
  pick up a dictionary . 
  there is one mod responsible for this survey . 
  looking at his history he is not very active on reddit so i assume he is busy doing other stuff . 
  glad you agree that it 's obvious . 
  i thought you implied that is was n't . 
  that white , black and asian people all can judge if something is racist and that there are probably a shitload of people who disagree with them either way . 
  same can be said about the black or asian person . 
  [ opschudding negerzoenen was marketing-truc ] ( http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/news.aspx?id=74257 ), 
  white people ca n't judge if something is racist ? 
  seriously . 
  bring back the negerzoenen !!,

  the problem arises when you call the children of said immigrants who are born in your country immigrants . 
  of all people you guys should know what happened . 
  true , free speech law trumped the blasphemy law . 
  that 's why we removed the law . 
  i totally agree with you . 
  or 55 % for all i care , it does n't really matter in this context . 
  because some countries in europe are still very religious ? 
  we had a blasphemy law till a month ago so i guess it 's not that odd that a country were 80 % is religious still has one . 
  yes , iirc we refused to sell to them . 
  if only i knew . 
  i did n't mean that they were bad , just that the price seems right for how dated they are . 
  like compared to our new cv90s . 
  specializing seems to be the plan at the moment and even though i kind of agree with it , it is still questionable if you want to be dependent on other countries . 
  conventional warfare mostly . 
  sure we still have apaches and combat vehicles , but by cutting out tanks we lose a lot of options on the battlefield . 
  oh sure , it 's a good deal , but it 's not under priced or anything . 
  we only deep fry snacks . 
  they are n't . 
  i think it is a good deal for us . 
  the oldest tanks are from 1982 and none have been upgraded since the 90 's . 
  i 'm also glad that they have been sold to finland and not a less trustworthy country . 
  having said that , i think it is a bad decision to sell all our tanks . 
  it 's crazy that they down size our army with $ 1.3 billion and at the same time buy those expensive jsfs . 
  downsizing sure , but cutting away an entire branch is dumb . 
  currently they are much cheaper , about $ 4 million . 
  really ? 
  in which other conflicts were you on your own ? 
  you mean that delicious senseo ? 
  how so ? 
  can you name this glorious belgian food ? 
  mom ? 
  seriously , it 's like dutch food , but worse . 
  really ? 
  like what kind of products ? 
  that 's no snow . 
  renewable energy is not cheap . 
  like what else ? 
  i was trying to point out that he was cherry picking years to prove his point . 
  he made a conclusion that you can not make on these two stats . 
  yes , but why not actual architecture , instead of these generic designs ? 
  he asked for the biggest , not all of them . 
  nice , a slightly different boring banknote . 
  * spain gdp ( world bank ) , 2008 : $ 1.593 trillion ; 2008 unemployment : 10 % * spain gdp ( world bank ) , 2012 : $ 1.322 trillion ; 2012 unemployment : 25 % this means that they produce ** less ** with far fewer workers . 
  how do you explain this other than by having less workers ? 
  the gdp in 2013 is lower than it was in 2007 despite the millions of people who have been added to the workforce . 
  you ca n't just say that they are more efficient and then ignoring the fact that they have n't grown the past 6 years . 
  i do n't know if you missed the whole economic crisis thing , but it 's not going so great in spain . 
  this number has to include people who do n't work but study right ? 
  if you want the opposite of `` yes '' then i agree . 
  if you just want the translation of `` no '' then that answer can be `` nee '' , but also `` geen '' . 
  it is not a mistranslation . 
  how else would you translate `` geen '' ? 
  dude , the [ vlaflip ] ( http://hardhoofd.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/vlaflip.jpg ) . 
  it does n't get much easier than that . 
  the guy did n't do that ... 
  apparently not . 
  not very good . 
  are you blaming that on us ? 
  that 's what the guy thought when he saw them driving towards syria . 
  what exactly do you mean with systematically neglected prosecution ? 
  wow really ? 
  ca n't we just stop will calling everything a circlejerk . 
  this thread is an anti-eu circlejerk i assume ? 
  since when is this sub called / r/europeanunion ? 
  i think there are a lot of people who are pro-eu but still think the eu does some things wrong . 
  voting for the euroskeptics assures that the eu can not push through controversial laws or expansion . 
  a lot of people think it 's about time the eu cools down and looks in the mirror instead of growing bigger and bigger . 
  who cares about a few downvotes more or less ? 
  i would say it 's pretty obvious that `` home market '' refers to finland . 
  i 've never heard anyone use that term to refer to the eu . 
  nobody buys a jolla solely because it is european though . 
   it 's also positive from a privacy point of view , because the company is selling handsets , not providing an os for free , and then selling your data . 
  and who is to say they do n't want to make more money ? 
  i do n't see why people would downvote a comment because it is merely an opinion without any added information . 
  but it is possible i guess . 
  your comment `` 2 redditors and the people who upvoted them to the top of the thread ... '' implied that you think those people represent `` the brits '' . 
  i guess i misunderstood . 
  i 'm not sure what your point is . 
  / u/joethesaint and / u/alwaysfair are still downvoted . 
  not to mention that i upvoted them even though i disagreed with them .
