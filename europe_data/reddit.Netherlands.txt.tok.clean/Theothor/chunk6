   like i said it has existed since the 90s cameron himself said the internet is an unregulated space and that this has to stop . 
  well , there are a few different groups who are against this filter . 
  to just put them all in the anti `` evil supervillain '' group does n't really do it justice . 
  there are people who think the filter will not accomplish anything and is just silly , people who are against any form of censoring and people who think this filter is just the beginning of a bigger censoring plan . 
  let 's assume cameron really does it for the kids . 
  just because his intentions are good , does n't mean that the implementation is any good . 
  i do n't think `` embarrassed husbands '' need to `` have a discussion '' with their partners . 
  i do n't even have kids , why do i need that filter ? 
  i also do n't think this filter will prevent kids from seeing porn . 
  kids these days are already on their ipad when they are zero years old . 
  you think they ca n't avoid a simple filter ? 
  the only thing that helps is parental supervision . 
  the government should n't try to play this role . 
  they were downvoted ... 
  i thought the true controversy was about the fact that this filter is not just limited to porn . 
  that cameron sells it as a `` porn filter '' , but in reality it goes far beyond that . 
  or at least that is what people are afraid of . 
  though i do n't know how true this is , it is still a good thing that people `` fight '' for an uncensored internet in my opinion . 
  do you have some compelling arguments ? 
  it 's a bit difficult to reply well-reasoned to such a blanket statement . 
  great retort . 
  yeah it 's pretty silly , though some arguments in favor of the filter would be nice . 
  ok , tagged you as the voice of britain . 
  2 redditors ! = the brits, 
  that khadafi handshake is terrible though . 
  just calling out fallacies does n't really add anything to the discussion either . 
  then the question should refect that and not be such a broad question . 
  i know , i can almost see the rotte from my window . 
  rotte does n't mean river though , it is the name of a river . 
  saying you are being too serious is an insult ? 
  really ? 
  you really took that as an insult ? 
  i knew you were gon na read it so it 's not really behind your back either is it ? 
  you really do take everything seriously . 
  well , it 's just a fun map . 
  you should n't take it overly serious , like a certain frisian does , 
  of course i can , this is not some academic map . 
  you 're right . 
  though in dutch `` roten '' is just the old spelling of `` rotten '' ( to rot ) , but is now just exclusively used as partially rotting hemp . 
  thanks for posting op . 
  missed it at / r/mapporn . 
  nice conversation piece , 
  anti + werf, 
  the land of frozen dessert . 
  yes , and i went from the same origin . 
  going from `` the people who swell with battle fury '' to `` the land of people who fight '' is not that big of a leap . 
  you are talking about the world map , he 's talking about the europe map . 
   zuuk t mar ** uut ** not really sophisticated  , but think it might be that `` uut '' meant both `` benedenstrooms '' and `` uit '' back in the day . 
  i do n't have a oud nederlands dictonary , but i assume `` uit '' was `` uut '' in that time or at least a very close variation of it . 
  men of the alliance -  warriors of the alliance -  warriors of the land -  land of warriors . 
  tada, 
  he man , do n't make me explain my relevant joke ... 
  `` u '' from utrecht meant `` uit '' , so `` from the crossing '' would be better i think . 
  true , but amstel is not just a name . 
  yeah i 'm talking about the meaning of the words in the past . 
  nowadays amstel is only used to refer to one particular river . 
  and a beer of course . 
  i assume borrowing water dam is rotterdam . 
  if so , `` rotte '' does n't mean borrowing water , it means `` to rot '' . 
  it comes from the way they processed hennep in order to made rope and clothing . 
  amstel also does n't mean `` river '' i think . 
  wetland would be more accurate . 
  cool map . 
  not totally accurate for the netherlands at least , but cool to think about nonetheless . 
  well , it could be true . 
  nobody really knows . 
  the common people are only paying more because it that though . 
  interesting choices . 
  both are/were also very popular in the netherlands , especially jacques brel . 
  here the song [ `` mijn vlakke land '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6vsjsubss0 ) was especially popular for obvious reasons . 
  here 's the french version of the song : [ `` le plat pays '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i9knlqa-p0 ), 
   through it all , dutch jews -- some of whom celebrate their own version of the black pete custom , called `` hanukklaas '' what the hell ... 
  no problem ? 
  oh it was n't a question , it was an answer to your question , 
  all of them ? 
  i have never downloaded anything illegally ? 
  but is n't kosovo recognized as a sovereign state by a ton of countries ? 
  not really the same as gibraltar , which is a dependent territory of britain . 
  how much ? 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  ha , 42,487 in the netherlands . 
  you got ta keep up guys . 
  i was kidding . 
  i actually picked greece ... 
  can you buy maggot cheese in the regular supermarket ? 
  what ... are ... you ... talking ... about ? 
  an italian ban on maggot cheese ? 
  obviously people can still make maggot cheese even if it 's banned . 
  banning something does n't mean that it magically vanishes . 
  i know ... and you ? 
  edit : you added `` i 'm talking about the ban on maggot cheese '' . 
  what is `` the ban '' ? 
  are n't we talking about the `` ban '' on cassia ? 
  there is not really a ban , just a limitation . 
  to some food the same limit does n't apply because that food is not normally eaten every single day . 
  or to traditional food to give the countries some leeway . 
  maggots are made of cinnamon ? 
  yeah i just read it . 
  sorry , cheap joke . 
  i do understand why they would do it though .
