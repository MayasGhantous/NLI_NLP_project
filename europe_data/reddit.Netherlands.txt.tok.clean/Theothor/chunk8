   because of one little country we are the sixth biggest economy of the eu . 
  if you think we are small , what do you think of the other 22 countries ? 
  do they not get a vote ? 
  in my opinion adding en new eu member is a very big deal and if there is n't a full support , it should n't happen . 
  let me explain . 
  first of all , we have not vetoed anything yet . 
  we decided that we will be vetoing it next week . 
  this does n't mean that we are the only country against this . 
  just the first one that has decided it . 
  there are a couple of reasons why we will veto . 
  * albania is still very corrupt and this has to be resolved before they get a candidate status . 
  * organised crime in the country is rampant . 
  * the eu can not handle another `` weak '' member . 
  we have enough problems already and have other issues to take care of . 
  * the adding of new eu countries is going too fast . 
  we can start adding members if everything is stable . 
  not when eu members are falling left and right . 
  this veto just means that they wo n't be a candidate the this year , next year there will probably be a new vote . 
  it 's just a fun way to show the second most spoken language . 
  what rights do these languages have ? 
  it means the second most used language . 
  they are though . 
  maybe you are using a different definition , but they are exactly that . 
  probably has a lot to do with the amount of stray dogs . 
  they did n't really fail because of the protesters . 
  they failed because they did n't want to use any force . 
  black ? 
  being lazy . 
  what the hell suriname . 
  you 're not doing a lot to counter your stereotype . 
   time required to start a business :  * 1 new zealand ... ... ... ... ... 1 day * 2 australia ... ... ... ... ... ... 2 days * 2 georgia ... ... ... ... ... ... . .2 days * 2 macedonia , fyr ... ... ... ... .2 days * 5 hong kong sar ... ... ... ... .3 days * 5 rwanda ... ... ... ... ... ... .3 days * 5 singapore ... ... ... ... ... ... 3 days  ...  * 140 suriname ... ... ... ... ... .694 days, 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r8ryex0.jpg ) might explain the randomness . 
  of all the lists in that report , they grabbed the one with the least variants or objective measurements . 
  with `` them '' i mean people who seek asylum , you 're talking about a group that came here 40 years ago . 
  yes , but you use it to imply that he has no idea what he 's talking about . 
  sounds great with girls , sounds hilarious with guys . 
  not sure how that generalisation matters . 
  are you really surprised by that ? 
  most of them probably do n't work . 
  kind of hard to get a job without knowing dutch or english . 
  yeah i know it 's an english word , but could n't image your typical guerilla combatant in the streets of turin . 
  what does guerilla mean ? 
  i highly doubt they would censor that opinion , but everything is possible i guess . 
  can you make a screenshot of your comment please ? 
  you would n't be able to see it if it was removed by the mods . 
  as a roman catholic above the rhine i can honestly say that i 've never experience any `` divide '' between the groups . 
  true , only since i 've been working with belgians i 've noticed how different we are . 
  at least at the corporate level . 
  though i doubt you are more different than frisians are to us . 
  i think the word i 'm looking for is domestic market . 
  every country has an internal market . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  oh i thought you where gon na write down the name of the beer after the x. i used my paint skills to improve it : http://i.imgur.com/lxm2een.jpg, 
  i want [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nspbmxl.png ) to become a thing . 
  the name is up for discussion . 
  are you going to every european country to try out their beers ? 
  because they have the biggest internal market in europe ? 
  what would have been too boring . 
  wow , so relevant . 
  that 's a lot of android . 
  pretty sure it was 50/50 only a few years ago . 
  makes sense i guess . 
  me too . 
  it 's much easier dan in mijn eigen taal te blijven praten . 
  why not ? 
  good luck . 
  off topic question . 
  why does your sub / r/politicsunbanned with 47 readers have 7 mods ? 
  it is one guy and i do n't see him attacking the cops . 
  having undercover cops in the crowd is n't necessarily to provoke , normally they are there to keep the peace . 
  i 'm not buying it . 
  does he have some real proof ? 
  all of them ? 
  or at least , that 's what they tell us . 
  no , i think star wars is more reminiscent of ukraine right now . 
  uhhh ... 
  i 'm not an annoying scumbag :(, 
  [ biggest christmas `` tree '' in the world in ijsselstein ] ( http://bin.snmmd.nl/m/m1nz500acfub.jpg ) [ the poor tree in my city rotterdam ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pczutov.jpg ), 
  is that a bad thing ? 
  i think their culture is a big part of it . 
  here in the netherlands most are happy with a 6 , in asia this is different i think . 
  how do you adjust the skipping school percentage with per capita gdp ? 
  well , we are clearly not getting better . 
  any idea what the reason might be ? 
   after all , if you are making a judgment on fyodor 's work , we 'd like to judge you * qua * judge . 
  if you post an article here you are asking for it to be judged . 
  i do n't really get why you would have to judge me in return . 
  it 's an odd thing to say . 
  i prefer discussion . 
  i did n't necessarily mean that europe had successes . 
  i meant that i do n't see the things mentioned as russian successes . 
   three months later , president bashar assad rides confidently in post , there has been an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough in relations with iran both these things are pretty positive for europe in my opinion . 
  and it 's not like putin singlehandedly causes this to happen . 
  i do n't really understand how the things he listed count as russian `` successes '' . 
  get your shit together iceland . 
  it 's weird , i can only find one comment that mentioned syria . 
   [ europe just provokes another civil-war like that one in syria . 
  us is standing behind eu and dictate them to reach their own interests e.g. 
  they aim to weaken russia and china .
