dokkum , heuuuuuu * cracks open shitty beer *, 
  it 's such a cute word, 
  `` just be happy with what you have '' i think , opening another shitty beer furiously, 
   i am a man from many subreddits !, 
  mmm mysterious, 
  i want to see more of these !, 
  just photos from the day in the life of someone anywhere in europe, 
  enjoy it while it lasts, 
  then they crash on your couch , which they do n't know is actually a metaphor for the european union . 
  shrugsforhugs, 
  how about `` give a pint to a brit '' ? 
  then they 'll hug you eventually, 
  the size of a very small child, 
  he resigned in telling the truth long before that, 
  just stop posting . 
  people can decide for themself what they want , we do n't need you . 
  how dramatic . 
  i 'm finnished with life if that 's what u mean, 
  what we need is a giant shush-machine, 
  heck , i accidentally deleted it, 
  let 's hope we 'll be able to move to mars soon . 
  let 's do a drinking game where regardless of the election results i will kill myself . 
  it 's not a symbol of a divided country , but it still does n't really make sense to me , reading through that . 
  `` noise complaints '' when there are n't even refugees yet ( and when building a wall also makes noise and the refugee camp already seems done ) almost feels like an excuse to build a wall to feel safe . 
  this along with the fact that the city did n't agree with building the `` camp '' there . 
  i ca n't wait for them to paint a quaint german landscape on the wall to make the orwellian picture complete . 
  is it reverse haunted or something ? 
  what the heck . 
  how much noise to these people make, 
  who is the wall built for ? 
  fugees or civilians ? 
  i think you have been memed, 
  ^ ^ yea ^ ^ i ^ ^ think ^ ^ he ^ ^ took ^ ^ a ^ ^ brexit, 
  shhhh guys ... nobody move . 
  brits respond to movement . 
  lame slacktivism, 
  i should go to france and never leave, 
  what a dick . 
  is that the dude who did christianity things, 
  it 's gon na be cold in mexico :o, 
  i did n't do anything but no problem my dude, 
  he 's caught red handed, 
  do n't ever reply to me or my son again, 
  you assume i care about that . 
  journalism should stay impartial and objective . 
   vile this article is biased, 
  he forgot to upgrade his other equipped weapon, 
  pfff ... youths these days . 
  why would they not use molotovs ? 
  either way yeah this does n't seem like a terror attack , and if it is , a very poor one . 
  i give it 2/10, 
  we should ban lieus . 
  did they pay for a ticket, 
  the automobile is n't public transport, 
  cool , they have a train track all around the island !, 
  those tiny train tracks all alone :(, 
  poor north ireland :(, 
  religion of pieces, 
  why repeat what i just said, 
  i tried to but we ended up bonding :( at the moment this place feels like the shire, 
  i was partly joking, 
  that 's a weird way to say that people shoot less bullets, 
  i think it 's important to note that this is a different van gogh than the painter .

  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/07/leaked-isis-document-reveals-plan-building-state-syria  `` if the west sees isis as an almost stereotypical band of psychopathic killers , we risk dramatically underestimating them . 
  they said a lot more than that, 
  why clap ? 
  btw what the fuck is wrong with the camera man , he 's not even filming them, 
  this could 've been written a lot better , feels like a random redditor wrote a thing in 45 minutes . 
  also , no nuance to be found . 
  good choice, 
   glorious  europe [ pick one ] ( http://imgur.com/5qglefd ), 
  the memes were better though . 
  i like ikea if i do n't really have to buy anything myself . 
  i can just sit in a kitchen and pretend there 's a gas leak . 
  we 're still living in the most peaceful time in history . 
  it 's all relative . 
  why is every thread the same thread now, 
  do you want a prize, 
  i do n't know but it hurts :(, 
  thanks , i 'll update !, 
  kinda annoying that although the news is there earlier , non-english links are not allowed on / r/worldnews . . 
  thanks , i 'll add it to the thing, 
  i kinda feel like i should have worded the title differently as well . . 
  i translated it from german to dutch and back to english . 
  does it usually mean it 's inflicted by someone else in english ? 
  at least one dead , more severely injured . 
  x-post from / r/worldnews . 
  / u/hyunl : there was an explosion in a restaurant in germany around 20minutes ago , nothing is certain yet except the explosion . 
  but some events like a music festival are going on tonight in ansbach , might be related . 
  will update this if i get more information update 1 : helicopter and a lot of ambulance/firefighters in ansbach right now , still waiting for informations whats going on , could be a gasexplosion ~ ~ / r/worldnews/comments / 4uf2xb/explosion _ in_ansbach_germany / ~ ~ [ got removed/deleted ] / r/worldnews/comments / 4uf8x5/explosion _ at_restaurant_in_ansbach_germany_causes / edit : second source : http://www.focus.de/panorama/welt/in-der-innenstadt-schwere-explosion-in-ansbach_id_5759057.html [ english source1 ] ( http://bnonews.com/news/index.php/mobile/id4956 ) [ english source2 ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1496592/german-police-say-one-person-has-died-after-explosion-in-ansbach-germany/ ) [ english source3 ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/692793/ansbach-explosion-nuremberg-germany-blast ) ** press conference : mayor confirms it was an explosive device . 
  ** [ link to german site ] ( http://www.nordbayern.de/region/ansbach/burgermeisterin-explosion-in-ansbach-durch-sprengsatz-1.5369153 ) it does n't say much else than that , other than high alert and unknown how many explosions there were . 
  at least one dead , ten people severely injured . 
  [ english source on explosive ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/692793/ansbach-explosion-nuremberg-germany-blast ) ** police says a man , a likely attacker , dies in explosion in germany ** 10 others injured . 
  source : https://twitter.com/ap/status/757361122961944576 seems like a failed attempt at an attack on the music festival nearby . 
  what 's the difference am i right but seriously i do n't know , they 're just long horses anyway, 
  and now the new born elephants shoot up schools, 
  ban husbands, 
  i remember when summer was the time that no news happened, 
  shitty writing .
