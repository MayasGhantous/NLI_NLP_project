incredible ... 
  oh then it 's allright , never mind . 
  the queen , yeah that makes sense , we should all accept the authority of parliament coming from the queen who is after all anointed by god so that makes much more sense then parliament it 's power coming from those who choose who parliament consists of . 
  i stand corrected ... god bless the queen and fuck the people . 
  ^ ^ reddit ^ ^ as ^ ^ a ^ ^ bastion ^ ^ of ^ ^ conservative ^ ^ feudal ^ ^ values . 
  ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ see ^ ^ that ^ ^ one ^ ^ coming, 
   this is literally the law in every country . 
   you have the highest decision making mechanism in the land . 
  it has primacy over everything . 
  how is the authority/sovereignty of parliament established ? 
  that 's right , it stems from the people , this is called democracy . 
  parliament is not the highest decision making mechanism , it is the people . 
  parliament disregarding the will of the people is a coup , and should be treated as such . 
   you have correctly identified my joke as a joke . 
  [ hey guys ] ( http://oi52.tinypic.com/2zewk8n.jpg ), 
  so the sovereignty of parliament is of higher importance than the sovereignty of the people it represents ? 
  whatever point you 're trying to make , the comparison with putin is comical to say the least . 
  yeah fuck democracy , lol xd :3 screw you brexit , salt much ? 
  why exactly would acting on a referendum make her a russian dictator ? 
  lol , the one dissident voice in this pro eu circlejerk of a sub and you accuse him of unoriginality . 
  agahahahahahahahahaaahaaa this guy truly is a master troll , leave the union and then proceed to make it even worse to prove his point . 
  what a guy . 
  i knew that ... 
  i 'm kvlt ... 
  brutal as fuck, 
  it 's netherlandian thank you very much, 
  yeah it 's so awful :( are these people trying to trigger the poor somalish people ? 
  that 's it , i 'm rooting for that super racist new right party ... and to think i actually used to see her as an example for other european leaders . 
  it 's typical for leftists to claim `` higher education '' in order to dismiss other stances as uninformed ignorant plebs who we should n't listen to . 
  why these people would favour voting per post is beyond me , maybe laziness but since they are `` highly educated '' that seems unlikely . 
  try the anglo saxon union, 
  the rise of the new right-wing parties all over europe incl germany suggest otherwise, 
  and all those things being true does n't prove us involvement in this coup in the slightest . 
  and also in the past they might 've toupled regimes they did n't like , but current day they sign very lenient peace deals with iran and take a much more neutral stance in the israel conflict . 
  ladies and gentlemen , i present our close nato ally, 
  yes , putin wants the presidency to be a hereditary title and reinstate serfdom because obviously putin ca n't be a different kind of animal than the people who led russia before him ... 
  that 's nice but that only refers to their name which is in both their cases related to the location they lived , the ancient philistines were most likely a people related to greeks and thus no semites ( arabs ), 
  philistines = palestinians ? 
  projecting the british flag on a building built by stalin , to convince them to not leave their suicide pact ... yeah that sounds like the eu i know, 
  okay , so you 're saying extreme examples of an action are by definition representive for the nature of that action ? 
  nice holocaust comparison m8 , really does justice to that whole ordeal and is completely in proportion to locking up illegal aliens from places where a lot of people want to run over westerners in trucks . 
  real nice . 
  marxist socialist that is , the other more obscure kinds are sometimes compatible with nationalism . 
  turkey can not into western democracy, 
  majority of turks atleast here in the netherlands suck erdogans balls like it 's a doner kebab . 
  so it needs subsidies to function ? 
  okey , i 'm looking at it , on some topics they are more in line with the socialists and a bit more often with the liberals . 
  what does this prove ? 
  so he 's the chairman of the council that defines the eu 's overall political direction and priorities , but that is not the highest position within the eu structure ? 
  sounds very likely , i guess it 's probably a combination of such factors, 
  it 's not a complement when i say that 10 of their `` points '' are pretty much one issue , it 's pathetic . 
  i do n't vote pvv , i think it 's an untrustworthy establishment party created by a life long politician . 
  but to say they are rightwingers because they get stuck in a loop when talking about how hard islam sucks is simply disingenuous ( ^ ^ just ^ ^ like ^ ^ copy ^ ^ pasting ^ ^ their ^ ^ party-program ^ ^ but ^ ^ accidentally ^ ^ formatting ^ ^ their ^ ^ sub-points ^ ^ about ^ ^ islam ^ ^ as ^ ^ 10 ^ ^ seperate ^ ^ points ) . 
  yeah pretty much i think , if i go though them * point 1 pretty much covers points 2 -9 and is more a conservative position then right-wing , but i guess it counts somewhat . 
  * 10 and 11 are n't right or left wing issues * 12 , 13 , 14 and 16 are pretty much equal to the positions of the socialist party * 15 and 17 are right-wing points . 
  3 rightwing points , 4 leftwing points , 2 neutral points , now i 'm not making the bizarre claim i 've heard from others that they are a leftist party , but to say they are `` far-right '' is equally insane . 
  guess i 'm ebil then ... 
  a democratically elected one ? 
  his own explanation is that he 's afraid of moles gaining influence trough party democracy . 
  i guess he only trusts himself to have control over the party . 
  and i do n't think this is completely paranoid . . only a little . 
  there are groups like antifa and such who practice alinsky 's rules for radicals who would surely try to infiltrate his party and constantly having to be on the lookout for that is n't very productive . 
  `` far right '' and that 's where i stopped reading , gekke geert is centrist-right at most . 
  oh no guys !, 
  i forgot to vote !, 
  the highest office in the eu and i was n't even aware of the entire election or what candidates contended and on what platforms they ran !, 
  ugh i feel so stupid ... well congratulations mr tusk , with your renewed authority over our lives . 
  it must 've been a real struggle to win the hearts and minds of so many different europeans . 
  like the completely fair and balanced cnn , msnbc or pbs for example . 
  these are networks that would never collude with political parties and keep their distance from them in order to remain unbiased . 
  `` ad hominem - the post '', 
  `` facebook and google support it '' now this must surely be a completely neutral and unbiased service without a hidden agenda . 
  good gooood ... 
  sure they probably have some retarded ideas , and if they are anything like my nation 's populists party ( pvv ) i do not support them at all . 
  but let 's be real here , they do n't get called extremists for their ideas on climate . 
  they get called extremists for wanting a homogeneous culture and adhering to the sovereignty of their nation more then to the eu , those are n't radical extreme ideas , they have been mainstream for the longest time . 
  as opposed to the many people on this sub who unironically support a european federation with a mix of european and non-european cultures . 
  that is one of the most radical political views you can have for god 's sake . 
  sure , it was just a friendly warning . 
  bless you , and good luck with stopping the rise of populism !, 
  `` everyone i do n't like is an extremist '' you understand that this mentality is why brexit and trump happened right ? 
  wer weren kenningen !, 
  ah the left is using one of it 's patented winning strategies again i see ? 
  i think you mean danzig ? 
  gib back rightful germanic clay !, 
  we should all enlist and die in russia now for the greater glory of the federal european states !, 
  [ fedora tipping intensifies ], 
  facebook is managed by a kid from macedonia ? 
  but whatever , it frightens me that there are so many people who think it 's a fantastic idea to give government more power to influence the flow of information without asking permission from the courts . 
  does nobody value trias politica anymore ? 
  what 's wrong with just enforcing libel laws as opposed to a literal ministry of truth ? 
  hehe merkel having feminine qualities ... ill see myself out ... 
  do n't worry , your heart attack is still on schedule, 
  obviously, 
  who cares ? 
  it 'll be much more relevant what the first woman president of france thinks about it . 
  edit , * hmm delicious salty downvotes , keep it up you sexists . 
  people seem to think them wrecking the axis ( which sweden was a part of ) was pretty great . 
  yeah we think genghis khan , ho shi minn and mao are just greaaat ... and to be honest those are the only guys i can think of, 
  ah the good old `` it will become better and cheaper '' mantra .
