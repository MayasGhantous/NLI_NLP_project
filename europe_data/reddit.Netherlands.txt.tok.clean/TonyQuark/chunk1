i 'm sorry , i should have said swedish really looks like a terrible speller trying to write half-norwegian , half-danish . 
  yes , it 's almost as if these languages [ share the same roots ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic_languages ) ... 
  i 'm not sure they 'd feel that way in flanders . 
  actually , they have n't felt that way since 1830 . , 
  would n't actually flanders be our brothers and germany our cousins ? 
  because `` hup nederland hup '' has too many syllables . 
   drive off a gradual slope into the north sea . 
  ftfy , 
  [ complete hearing in parts ] ( http://audiovisual.europarl.europa.eu/package.aspx?page=1610&amp;id=16258&amp;mediatype=v ), 
  nice . 
  now the bus is perfect . 
  they have , apparently . 
  good that it 's a campaign with football players then . 
  ah , makes sense , and they are more recognisable that way of course . 
  but i 'd have painted them the gold/yellow colour . 
   the bus looks great [ from the rear ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mdafme8.jpg ) too , i see . 
  that boris is one hell of a mayor . 
  i happen to know he 's also copying dutch-style bicycle paths . 
  good on you all , i 'd say . 
  look it up . 
  you 're doing it wrong . 
  then again , you could be a racist of course . 
  that 's really well done . 
  my only small gripe is the colour of the card readers ( if that 's what those are ) . 
  are they in service yet ? 
   not sure if the gvb buses used to have ads on the outside . 
  do n't think so . 
  not really a lot of space available due to the panoramic windows , i guess . 
  [ it can be done though , like on this tram . 
  wow , that 's the best looking bus i 've ever seen ( never thought i 'd say this ) . 
  dat shiny red !, 
  not amsterdam , but here 's [ a dutch bus with an ad ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8a1bnlq.jpg ) on it . 
  so soon already ? 
   german police apologise for fining one-armed cyclist for riding his bike with only ** one arm ** #  ** unarmed ** clear enough ? 
   un-armed, 
   unarmed, 
   germanic speakers have an advantage in learning english ( its more related to their languages ) actually , latin and french both , individually , formed a bigger influence on english than germanic languages did . 
  so to say that dutch and german people have an advantage at learning english is not due to english itself . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_language_influences_in_english ) possible causes might include exposure to english , the quality of the english curriculum , the perceived importance of learning english , etc. 
   thats why the french host presented the results in english you mean in french , right ? 
   on the other hand we can say why does germany/england/netherlands etc refuse to speak spanish ? 
  that 's quite easily answered : spanish is not a common language in europe . 
  english is . 
  probably because he 's not satisfied with the finnish government 's policies , and hopes that a lower rate will demonstrate that he 's right to the rest of the country . 
  same in the netherlands , while ~ 6 % of trains are 5 minutes late . 
   half of the traffic that comes into rotterdam will then move through ? 
  right , belgium . 
  i assume you have a source for this . 
  i 'm guessing export to germany is higher . 
  as for the rest of your comment , you 're just repeating what you said earlier and i 've already commented on that . 
  ignorance is ~ ~ bliss ~ ~ hurting people . 
  it 's difficult to argue with ( self-described ) neo-nazis , because reason is not for them . 
  so immigrants are doing the jobs we do n't want to do and thereby helping our economy ? 
  let 's bomb them !, 
   port of antwerp is the start of many smuggling routes into europe same in rotterdam unfortunately . 
  but , apparently less murder . 
   great highway network leading to any direction ( mainly south and east ) same in rotterdam . 
  but , apparently less murder . 
   small country so inadequate police force to deal with international crime rings , no point is further than 100km from a border for easy escape almost the same in rotterdam unfortunately . 
  but , apparently less murder . 
   high immigration ratios ... 
  but , apparently less murder . 
   wallonians earn on average 25 % less than flemish people people dutch provinces like drenthe and groningen also make less . 
  but , apparently less murder . 
   foreign stop-and-go crime from france 's poorest regions in the north is a reoccuring issue in the provinces of west flanders and hainaut people come to antwerp to commit murder ? 
   without mentioning any islamic minorities same in rotterdam . 
  but , apparently less murder . 
  i think i might have detected a flaw in your reasoning . 
   racism is n't a big part , just an afterthought or a spin for jokes . 
  #  one night an entire family of varying ages and genders ranted about how the neighboring village should be bombed for having too many immigrants you 're contradicting yourself . 
   many had muslim friends and all ate doner okay , then it 's perfectly acceptable . 
  estonia is in the eu and nato . 
  an attack on estonia is an attack on all of us . 
  because he 's american and he 'd rather be dead than red . 
  thanks . 
  last time i got gilded , the username tracker happened to come in handy , actually . 
  i like that feature . 
  cheers !, 
  it better be one of those expensive belgian ones , then . 
  meh , i 'd rather play a game or explore an awesome map . 
  circlejerking over whatever stupid shit some feminist or a particular dumb american said is your idea of having a good time , apparently . 
  nah , you hang with the tumblrinaction and shitamericanssay crowds . 
  you 're too far gone already . 
  well , if a joke is stupid , maybe it 's not funny , and maybe it wo n't get recognized as a joke . 
  try harder next time . 
  or watched only those scenes !, 
  limburgian lion, 
  does anybody in the political arena compare these practices to censoring a newspaper or a tv station then ? 
   the netherlands #  holland ( n and s ) good guy ggow , properly using the proper names . 
  so people in turkey basically said the censorship of twitter , youtube , soundcloud and richard dawkins ' website is okay . 
  because you ate them all . 
  did you just reply to the same comment again ? 
  if i 'm not mistaken , rutte came by car . 
  also , the backdrop appears to be the haagse bos . 
  it 's not out of the norm in the netherlands . 
  also , the photo of the dutch pm was n't taken at the nss . 
  and sometimes little kids . 
  anyone can copy us if they so please . 
  it 's not like it 's a secret . 
  also , we 're one of the most densely populated countries in the world .
