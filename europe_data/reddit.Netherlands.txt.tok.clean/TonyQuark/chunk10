  ftfy . 
  i was curious back when i was a teenager and lit it up occasionally so i actually looked it up . 
  it seems [ the website is still around ] ( http://www.om.nl/onderwerpen/boetes/?boete_tree=3138,3110#keuzes ) : `` politiesepot en afstand doen van de drugs . 
  drugs wordt in beslag genomen . 
  well , it 's probably due to the fact that i 'm dutch and am interested in history that i have heard of william iii of orange on the english/irish throne at all . 
  he was william ii in schotland by the way . 
  i 've heard of the war of the roses ( thanks to qi ) and i know in the netherlands similar battles took place amongst nobility called the hook and cod wars . 
  but i did n't know for instance that victoria was from the house of hanover !, 
  i 've read up on that a bit . 
  edit : a word . 
  well , you ca n't have a dutchman invading your national history !, 
  [ frisians ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/frisians.png ), 
  wrong . 
  the police can still detain you and confiscate the drugs . 
  they just wo n't arrest you , because the da wo n't prosecute . 
  and that 's why `` decision decision '' is funny . 
  i 'm sorry you do not feel the same way . 
  you tell me then . 
  i 'm thinking the class would look like `` decision decision '' . 
  care to enlighten me ? 
  `` if this element should like . decision , make it look like . decision again . '', 
  as does the rest of mainland europe . 
  the title of the video is `` win the yes needs the no to win against the no . '', 
  he 's literally translating a french proverb and using poor english grammar . 
  dude , i quoted you verbatim as a joke . 
  / s denotes i was being sarcastic . 
   i do n't even think there are sides . 
  accurate scientific data is backed up by evidence . 
  people denying climate change have an agenda , like oil companies , or are influenced by those with an agenda , like certain news outlets . 
  it 's 9 years old , but yes , good point . 
  leftist scientists are making stuff up to get some free money from the state , and they 're just trying to weaken our economy , for whatever reason !, 
  you might be right about statistical data . 
  but this is observational data . 
  then again , as you can find in the [ comments ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1m5wqv/air_pollution_in_europe_mapped_by_satellite_1800/ ) in / r/mapporn , `` this particular heatmap visualizes nitrogen dioxide concentration . 
  i bet particulate matter pollution map would look different . '', 
  says / u/frukt . 
  he 's right that this map displays no2 because that 's what the [ source ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/observing_the_earth/envisat/global_air_pollution_map_produced_by_envisat_s_sciamachy ) tells us . 
  so this map might not display pollution accurately . 
  for instance , people in the [ other thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1m5wqv/air_pollution_in_europe_mapped_by_satellite_1800/ ) have suggested some parts of the balkan and eastern europe look ` too clean ' . 
  then there 's also the issue of [ population density ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density#main_table ) . 
   since they live in america , i do n't think that would be an issue , especially since it is not a criminal offense . 
  it 's not ? 
  aww , in the rest of the civilized world it is . 
  we europeans burn shitty parents at the stakes all day . 
  i agree that tlc is garbage . 
  but [ we do n't have the death penalty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_punishment_in_europe ) , that 's you guys . 
  i fucking freaked out when i saw that show `` toddlers and tiaras '' . 
  and that 's on the ** learning ** channel ? 
  ca n't be unlearned . 
  you 've pretty much disproven your own point with that map . 
  on this map , a shade of blue means acceptance of gay people . 
  so let 's look at all of the western countries , or countries with western influences : * europe : blue * north-america : blue * middle-america : blue * south-america : blue * south-africa : blue * australia & nz : blue only western country that is not blue ? 
   all kinds of animals are bred for competitions where they are judged on appearance . 
  ... including toddlers . 
  [ truth revealed behind petition to ban oktoberfest ` because it offends muslims ' ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/truth-revealed-behind-petition-ban-6459561 ), 
  how do you not see that as trolling ? 
  stupidity confirmed . 
  you can still do that . 
   kamper is like traveller * kamper * is more like ` pikey ' . 
  wow , this guy is not squatting !, 
  okay , never heard islamist being used to refer to a moderate muslim . 
  the - ist part denotes fundamentalism if i 'm correct . 
  anyway , i really do hope the secularization continues . 
  less sectarianism for one would do the middle-east a lot of good . 
  do moderate islamists exist ? 
  i do n't think conservative islam and islamist are the same . 
  the former can exist in a democracy , while the latter advocates sharia law , which would only work in a theocracy . 
   this is a crucial sign that muslim societies are undergoing a major modernizing , secularizing wave - - even if they elect islamist parties while doing so . 
  could it be that the islamist parties are elected not * in spite * of this , but * because * of this secularizing ? 
  as a countermovement within these societies ? 
  tl ; dr : immigration policy should be based on `` vibes '' . 
  so going by your own descriptions , only de volkskrant is heavily left wing . 
  this directly contradicts your earlier statement that ` many of the dutch media is definitely heavily left focused ' . 
  by the way , the example in that article why journalists being left-wing does n't automatically make the news outlet left-wing , but forms a problem nonetheless , is laughable . 
  martin bosma ( pvv ) saying man-made climate change is a left-wing issue ? 
  is science also leftist * ? 
  as for other outlets , i do n't know about nos , but you can hardly say that the rtl 4 news or rtl z is left-wing . 
  i think you are missing their point . 
   many of the dutch media is definitely heavily left focused and by no means neutral in a long shot source ? 
  or are you very right wing ? 
  because then everything looks left wing . 
  he got on the train in belgium . 
  still , they also have dual citizenship . 
   the media in belgium will say he was just confused they 're already calling it a possible terrorist attack ... 
  facts do n't real , only feels . 
   pick someone who speaks well english lol, 
  yeah , it bugged me as well . 
  ' a bad rap ' stems from ' a bad rap sheet ' . 
  a ` record of arrest and prosecution ' . 
  nothing to do with wrapping or rapping . 
  do you still drink other alcoholic beverages ? 
  my condolances . 
  but what about children who choose to drink ? 
  you basically called me a nazi . 
  i 'm not going around saying you support golden dawn , do i ? 
  i 'm saying i like greeks in general so as to not have you percieve this as an attack on greece , but you are just incredibly rude and bigoted . 
   when did greece vote to be in the eurozone , when where the people asked ? 
  hey , you elected your government and they decided to join and not give you a referendum . 
  how is that the eu 's fault ? 
  be mad at your fellow-countrymen .
