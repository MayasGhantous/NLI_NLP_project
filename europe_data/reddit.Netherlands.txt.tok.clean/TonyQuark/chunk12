  right , will post the source here . 
  not available to me now . 
   as nothing gets done in belgium well , they do have to cope with 18 governments . 
  as it says in the bottom right , statista.com . 
  [ full link here , in german and behind a paywall . 
  more like * \u00c0 nos lits , mes coll\u00e8gues * !, 
  alright , see , now you 've got me curious . 
  why are you interested in europe/germany ? 
  ( pro-tip : do n't start talking german in the netherlands , just speak english . ), 
  and the news paper thing . 
  and the thing about her daughter . 
  anyway , what do you think about our prime minister ? 
  what do you know about one of your most imporant trading partners ? 
  how much dutch do you know ? 
  heh , i do n't think you are insane either . 
  i do n't even believe in ` evil ' . 
  i do think that the gop is only about greed and power though . 
  to me , that 's batshit insane . 
  we had a great back-and-forth imo , but you 're not going to convince me that a party that thought sarah palin made for a good veep actually cares about joe plummer 's taxes . 
  [ so , basically what i just said ? 
   ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3de5p9/support_for_a_european_federation_of_nation/ct4u313 ) i appreciate the support , but i have my own style of debating . 
  american politics has too few parties , too much monetary involvement and too much corporate influence . 
  and i do think republicans pander to far-right sentiments , especially because they are influenced by these corporations . 
  the republicans convince civilians to agree to these sentiments , but not because of the same issues the corporations raise . 
  oh , i have engaged . 
  just look elsewhere in this thread . 
  but i do n't aim to disagree . 
  yes , brilliant shift from `` climate change does n't exist '' to `` it 's not man made '' . 
  that 's like saying `` who cares if we drown ? 
  not our fault ! '', 
   really , does it matter , if this is a real threat ? 
  i ca n't verify what you 're saying now . 
  all i know is we 've legalized gay marriage 14 years ago . 
  was n't , but i 'm willing to drop it . 
  i like science too . 
  alright . 
  same as 5 then . 
  i will never agree to the reasons for the latest iraq war . 
  but i 'm not going to ruin the mood now . 
  i said ` akin ' . 
  i was in new york a few months before 9/11 . 
  love the city . 
  that day people died i felt the attack might as well have been on amsterdam . 
  that 's where we 're the same . 
  and i do n't expect the chinese to feel the same . 
  that 's why we need negotiations . 
  and what party opposed gay rights for the longest time ? 
  just making the point that the republicans might not be the best at recognizing social issues . 
  i thought you agreed . 
  thanks , agreed . 
  we could probably argue forth and back about just this one , so let 's agree to disagree . 
  i like my capitalism with a pinch of socialism . 
  first point : true . 
  second point : getting rid of saddam/finding wmds/attacking terrorists after 9/11 ... 
  the reasons changed as they went . 
   besides him you did say that , and i misread . 
  i have no problem admitting that . 
  for this one , i will apologize . 
  i 'm just glad you can also see some of these candidates are batshit insane . 
  my country does it , nitwit . 
  we 're prepared for a rise in sea-levels , while cities get hit and flooded by sandy leaving devastation akin to 9/11 and i fucking cried seeing that aftermath . 
  are you seriously claiming republicans have been pro-gay rights all along ? 
  well , i guess that 's a weird way of saying a raped woman can in fact get an abortion . 
  anti-vaxxers are batshit insane . 
  look into your own political system and learn about a majority congress . 
  yeah , `` jobs happen '' . 
  rich people are rich because they * do n't * spend money . 
  republican presidents allowed it . 
  yes , democrats are just as warmongery as the republicans . 
  as i said , you guys need more than 2 parties . 
   most of the others besides him and huckabee are pretty normal . 
  no , no , no . 
  [ let 's let mike talk ] ( http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/mike-huckabee-still-talking-crazy-20110505 ) . 
  huckabee is a full-on homophobic birther . 
  batshit insane , i tell you . 
  yup . 
  practically a socialist . 
  would be good for the states to have a true left-wing president for once . 
  note : the states have basically no left wing . 
  yes , both major parties in the us have crazy supporters . 
  that 's why i said you guys need more major parties . 
  the majority of european countries have multiple parties . 
  you guys have 2 major ones . 
  that 's just one step up of 1 state party ( yes , i am referring to russia ) . 
  yeah , some democrats think vaccinations are evil , so let 's not negotiate with china about emission limitations . 
  are you for real ? 
  more and more states are legalizing gay marriage . 
  it 's that what you mean by `` it 's not an issue '' ? 
  because not too long ago black men could n't vote in the states . 
  i 'm glad you did n't say that `` the female body has ways to shut that thing down '' . 
  honestly , one week after a rape , a women wo n't be allowed to get an abortion ? 
  why not ? 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  5 . lol . 
  american exceptionalism at its worst . 
  it 's about lobbyism , plain and simple . 
  the aca is * not * universal health care . 
  and you have the republican party to thank for that . 
  but okay , set aside all of that . 
  is your economy more important than your population 's health ?
