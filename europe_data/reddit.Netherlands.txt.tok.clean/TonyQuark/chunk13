  you do n't seem to get that taxing the rich at least on the same level as the poor brings in more money . 
  i 'm not subscribed to / r/politics . 
  i 'm referring to the iraq war or the vietnam war . 
  but sure , forget about those . 
  and you 're confusing the un and the usa . 
  oh , you want to know why the gop is batshit insane ? 
  because they deny climate change , are against gay marriage , think abortion is murder , and celebrate anti-intellectualism . 
  they have you convinced health care is bad for freedom , trickle-down economics works like magic and huge corporations that do n't pay much taxes are job creators . 
  they advocate war over negotiations and advocate arming rebels over diplomacy , time and time again . 
  so , yeah . 
  well , then i guess you have no more questions ? 
  i do as a matter of fact . 
  small government is a goal to them , not a means . 
  do you know any europeans off of this site ? 
  well , it did make sense to support obama . 
  i know i did . 
  i will probably always support the democratic candidate over the republican one . 
  only because the republicans are batshit insane . 
  the usa needs more major parties desparately . 
  molotovs and rioting in athens . 
  urk ( pronounced ehrk , using english spelling ) used to be an island . 
  now it 's a village because we reclaimed the land around it ( yes , we alter maps ! ) . 
  the villagers still say `` on urk '' in stead of `` in urk '' . 
  they 're really religious because of their seafaring past , which makes them an interesting subject of studies for sociologists and the like . 
  you did a hell of a job already . 
  i can only applaud your work . 
  i have been scrolling for a good 10 minutes now . 
  yes . 
  macedonia would have a field day . 
  lesbos , please . 
  the baltics are also in nato . 
  if a russian soldier so much as sets foot on nato soil , it 's war . 
  they know they ca n't win that war . 
  i wo n't lie , i 'd be angered more by an attack against denmark ( they 're like our brother from another mother ) than a baltic state , but the same principle applies . 
  come on , get with the times . 
  clearly this is the hip and happening song all the youngsters swing to : [ the five stars - atomb bomb baby ] ( https://youtu.be/yr4uri9h_ds ), 
  including spaces , the german name is actually one character longer . 
  actually , the netherlands has less pot-smokers than surrounding countries do . 
  just more people that have tried it once . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annual_cannabis_use_by_country ) ( the netherlands is at 5.4 % ) . 
  the link flairs also work if you 've disabled thumbnails . 
  and in the sidebar are filter buttons ( so you can hide or show only certain flaired posts ) . 
  thanks for the compliment . 
  i designed them this way to be non-distracting , and it 's always nice to hear that my work is appreciated . 
  all fair points . 
  but how about some solutions ? 
  you should take a look at / r/rmtk and join a party ( see sidebar ) . 
  yes , all of the people who voted for the pvv . 
   but at least this created a precedent . 
  i rewatched some episodes a while back . 
  brilliant show . 
  i watched that and [ alfred j. kwak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfred_j._kwak ) . 
  case in point : the right-wing populist pvv was in a minority government ( without supplying any ministers or secretaries ) in the netherlands in 2010 . 
  lasted 2 years . 
  after that , a bunch of people in the party quit and they subsequently lost a lot of votes . 
  if you do n't like people talking to each other , why are you even commenting yourself ? 
  there 's no iq tests involved . 
  the difference is that in the netherlands you choose and are advised a certain level of schooling . 
  you specialise after high school , when going to a college/university . 
  in belgium you choose in what field you would like to work right away . 
  so , that actually determines your life choices early on way more . 
  mind you , not all high school students in the netherlands take all courses . 
  students have profiles ; nature & technology , nature & health , economics & society or culture & society . 
  the organisation that conducted this research is the european cycling federation . 
  in their mind , people ca n't do without cycling federations . 
  read through this whole thread of you trolling and people responding and downvoting you . 
  well done , mr. poop slinger . 
  you should have seen [ dutch guilder notes ] ( https://barryborsboom.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/dutch_banknotes.png ) . 
  spacy !, 
  ah , yes , bejing , that typically portuguese city ... 
  since you can get various tax breaks and things like that , you 're more or less incapable of running a small startup business if you do fail , or so people tend to think . 
  women *, 
  startups in the netherlands are generally private limited liability companies . 
  going bankrupt is frowned upon more than in the states among tech companies . 
  first of all , i was phrasing it that way to contrast the two problems . 
  second , government debt and deficit were among the main causes for the greek crisis , coupled with false statistical data . 
  and yes , [ tax evasion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_government-debt_crisis#tax_evasion_and_corruption ) played a large part . 
  but since you 're taking that tone , i 'm done . 
  greeks dodged taxes en masse . 
  these war refugees are dodging bullets . 
  yeah , send them back into a war zone . 
  how lovely . 
  greece ruined their own economy . 
  but these refugees come from outside of the eu ; it 's not like a country such as italy created them . 
  so leaving only the mediterranean countries to deal with the refugees is unfair . 
  / thread, 
  traditionally the northern part was protestant , the southern part was catholic , separated by the three main rivers . 
  religion seeping out of the pores of the eu . 
  no , thanks . 
  yes , i know , it 's hard to determine where to draw the line . 
  `` cirkel '' has been in the dutch language since the 13th century . 
  but we do have the germanic alternative `` kring '' . 
  english loanword . 
  found the frisian !, 
  dutch is a language in between english and german ( just like the country 's pisition on a map ) . 
  but all three are germanic languages ( although english has had way more french and latin influences ) . 
  those are both latin loanwords though . 
  the auteur was referring to words like `` school '' and `` schip '' . 
  yeah , just listen to an arab say the name . 
  hard g-sound .
