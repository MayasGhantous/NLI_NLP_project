  more like the arabic h , as is `` mohammed '' . 
  you might do better on / r/european . 
  that 's where they have ~ ~ true freedom of speech ~ ~ blatant racism . 
   must be the french influence . 
  must be indeed . 
   i live quite close to the border well , there 's your problem . 
   i 've noticed huge differences between the pronunciation of words in breda and antwerpen . 
  it 's not about `` gestoken '' . 
  you would probably say `` erbij gestoken '' . 
  but really though ? 
  the past participle * to have added * in flemish could be said as `` bij gestoken '' , from `` bijsteken '' , literally * to stick with * ( not an actual english expression ) . 
  dutch people would say `` erbij gestopt '' , past participle of `` erbij stoppen '' , literally * to put with * . 
  not only would we use a different word , we 'd also add the preposition `` er '' . 
  although it should be noted we fully understand each others ' meaning . 
  edit : clarification . 
  dutch people would n't say this . 
  well , at least now you 're citing a source , in stead of just giving your `` opinion '' . 
  but i think you do n't have a clue about the timelines involved . 
  just the fact that europeans have a lot of ~ ~ asian dna ~ ~ dna in common with asians does not mean therefore europeans must have always been white ( or light-skinned ) . 
  [ look at this map of early human migration ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eyb9pui.jpg ) . 
  see how it says 35-40 ,000 years ago ? 
  the article talks about 8,000 years ago . 
  okay , but one with the lights off , or you 'll learn all of our best ` techniques ' . 
   45 points ( 91 % upvoted ) clearly this is just humor , not a serious infographic . 
  we need you guys as well , as our number 1 competitors .

  true !, 
  perfect summation of british-german ( and dutch-german ) relations in [ this part of a qi episode on germany ] ( https://youtu.be/6cldlrz9xew?t=5m4s ) . 
  keyword there : living . 
  as in , already there . 
  that 's why this problem needed solving in the first place . 
  did you read the article at all ? 
  can confirm indonesians are quite relaxed about their faith . 
  most of them i 've met in the netherlands are only `` culturally muslim '' , like a non-practicing jew or a lapsed catholic . 
  over in indonesia it differs per island . 
   people arrived in europe were white , also . 
  so , according to you , people became white , and then went to europe . 
  they did not become white in europe ? 
  re-read the article . 
  and your opinion does n't matter . 
  what matters is data and evidence . 
  today you learned ? 
  the only two brits in this thread ( from what i can tell ) and they * have * to make lame ww2 jokes ... 
  i like british humor , but really , these jokes have never been funnier than when john cleese did them in fawlty towers . 
  and that was in the '70s . 
  you do n't have to pay a fine . 
  in fact , there 's all sorts of safety nets to prevent people from becoming homeless . 
  should 've started growing tulips . 
  it lines up with the snoo and the subreddit name . 
  it 's just css , not an existential crisis . 
  thanks . 
  we stole that from / r/naut , actually . 
   where did this feedback even come from ? 
  [ this previous post . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4cyby3/new_style_update_general_feedback_post/ ), 
  last time we did that , we were told we should n't use a european snoo ( it had stars around it ) . 
  there 's no pleasing everyone . 
  the idea behind it is that you might look at the posts in a different light . 
  but like i said , we are aware of the objections . 
  we can change to a more traditional tabbed menu . 
  that 's okay . 
  we like hearing feedback . 
  we could consider doing that , sure . 
  we 'll be processing all of this feedback , so we 'll take it under advisement . 
  that 's the old snoo , and it was hard to part with as it has been in the header for a long time . 
  it 's a symbol for europe , not the eu . 
  medical science is improving fast . 
  that 's a bad sign . 
  it means there 's not enough of it . 
  but it 's the best to go on . 
  yes , we test the plants , and the ones that work , we turn into medicine . 
  [ i 'll just leave this here . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ymvmb90hem8?t=1m14s ), 
   a lot of chinese traditional medicine and herbal medicine seems to have some effect and if it came to a vote , i 'm sure two-thirds of the country will declare them legitimate too , seeing how even you do , without any scientific proof whatsoever . 
  or maybe direct democracy can fuck up too . 
  one of the best known homeopaths , alfred vogel , is swiss , by the way . 
  yes , there literally were . 
  ever heard of the yugoslav wars ?

  i do occasionally .

  considering the state of highways in belgium , maybe you should actually try making their management federal . 
  so the police are in fact doing their jobs and warning people of the risks . 
  is n't the police there to figure out the source ? 
  if they do that , then they 're doing their jobs . 
  meanwhile , they are in fact warning of the risks . 
  but this situation is horrible , no doubt about that . 
   now they 're not even bothering to warn populace anymore of the risks is n't this post proving the exact opposite ? 
  in the netherlands , many people follow the dutch league of course , but also the english , german and spanish leagues , because they find them very interesting because of the competition . 
  plus , the fact that there are and have been several dutch players and coaches/managers in those countries helps a lot to bring more appeal to those leagues .
