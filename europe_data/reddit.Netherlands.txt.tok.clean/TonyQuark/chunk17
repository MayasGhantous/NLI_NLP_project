  i really want to get into eu4 . 
  my favorite games include empire and napolean total war , but i just ca n't get into europa universalis . 
  it 's such a steep learning curve for the time i have available . 
  can you please recommend some walkthroughs or let 's plays to get me started ? 
  i know of / u/quill18 's playthroughs but really , i have no idea why he makes certain decisions .
