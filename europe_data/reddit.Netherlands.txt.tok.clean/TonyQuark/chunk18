  not really , since no change in the law on conscription is required . 
  less chance of child mortality among wealthy populations . 
  you do realise there are positions in the military ( like in intelligence and medicine ) that do n't rely on physical capabilities , to which i assume you are referring ? 
  i was talking about the use of the phrase ` push back ' . 
  could mean literally push back boats into the sea , or push back immigrants . 
  that 's why i 'm asking . 
  ( to be clear , i 'm not advocating literally pushing boats back . ), 
  it does . 
  do you have a source other than this greek minister saying that , though ? 
  i think that belgian minister is an ass for other reasons , but i think attributing this comment to him serves no-one . 
  if by ` good chances of survival ' you mean , die of nuclear fallout later , then sure . 
  tl ; dr : greek minister does n't speak english well enough to understand the meaning of ` push back ' in this case and fucks up . 
  tl ; dr : greek minister does n't speak english well enough and fucks up . 
  except these things might actually work , unlike ` duck and cover ' . 
  right . 
  i have no sympathy for the russian government at all , but making misleading claims is n't going to help anyone . 
  there 's also the question form , by the way : ` is russia poisoning western dignitaries ? ', 
  ( but maybe the author [ did n't want people thinking ` no ' , right away ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge's_law_of_headlines ) . ), 
  an actual translation of ` the netherlands ' , and not ` holland ' ? 
  colour me impressed !, 
  full disclosure : that 's a service road . 
  yet besides canals , we have actual paved roads , unlike whatever belgians drive on . 
  it was reported the very day after . 
  who would you like us to ask in stead ? 
  carpenters ? 
  you win original comment of the year , and we have n't even started it !, 
   their only agenda is ensuring the streets are safe like they used to be . 
  they are literally saying ` migrants not welcome ' . 
  i do n't think it 's just about having safe streets . 
  besides , militias or vigilante mobs are n't a particularly good idea . 
  mob `` justice '' is ugly , does not consider innocence and does not become a country where there is rule of law . 
  those are n't pranks . 
  but if you 're going to give an example , best do it right . 
  see how far this goes !, 
  whereas this far-right group does n't push any agenda whatsoever . 
  / s by the way , about those [ wuppertal sharia police ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sharia_patrols#2014_incidents_in_wuppertal.2c_germany ) :  the 33-year-old behind the wuppertal patrols , former fireman sven lau , published a video on his website , ** claiming that the men involved had simply worn mock uniforms for a few hours and that `` sharia police '' never existed . 
  ** `` we knew that this would raise attention , '' lau said , claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about sharia law in germany . 
  they were *** obviously *** syrians . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  psh , our dikes can withstand a 1 in 10,000 years storm . 
  the sea is our bitch . 
   the state police offered 100 police officers as reinforcement . 
  the police in cologne declined that offer . 
  not that i 'm saying you 're lying , but it would be helpful if you could provide a source for that statement . 
  / u/fluchtpunkt is saying the exact opposite in [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/401k8h/police_president_of_cologne_put_into_temporary/cyqtqr0 ) . 
   the state police offered 100 police officers as reinforcement .
