  the police in cologne declined that offer . 
   state police is the police that is used during demonstrations . 
  they are trained in crowd control and anti-riot measures . 
  they are also trained to arrest groups of violent people . 
  a source on either would be nice . 
   water wars of the 2040s well , i know who 's going to win that !, 
  oh , you mean the war * for * water , not against ? 
  schools also give kids time off during summer . 
  not an official holiday either . 
  official holidays are christmas and easter , for example . 
   like the south of the netherlands , germany etc. 
  it is already an official holiday . 
  no , it 's not . 
   in flanders , holland is also an alternative to the netherlands . 
  as is the case in many countries . 
  thing is , how would you like to be called wallonian ? 
  that 's about as accurate as calling all of the netherlands ` holland ' . 
  or calling the uk ` england ' . 
  it 's not that big of a deal when someone not from the netherlands says it . 
  i do think it 's kind of strange when a dutch person calls the country ` holland ' though . 
  except for in a football stadium . 
  but who am i kidding , coming wc i 'll be rooting for belgium . 
  ( and perhaps germany second . ), 
  blind nationalism is n't really something western-europeans do . 
  there 's going to be more people disagreeing with their pm or president because they see more of what they do . 
  c'mon man , we can get past this petty shit and just enjoy making fun of each other , right ? 
  i 've watched danish shows and movies and they 're really good . 
  do n't be butthurt . 
  denmark is awesome . 
  actually , talking like danes makes us sound ridiculous . 
  just kidding , i love denmark . 
  we also piss on your infrastructure . 
  we 're equal opportinity offenders . 
  ^ ^ ^ j/k, 
  it 's an oversimplification to just blame the us for all instability in the middle east . 
  but isis does in fact consist of and gets support from saddam hussein 's former baathist party who were unemployed after the american invasion of iraq . 
  actually , no , we signed a convention that states we would shelter refugees . 
  photoshop . 
  that 's the description by / u/potverdorie . 
  concept is his , map is mine , as indicated . 
  take it up with him . 
  heh , well done . 
  to others , mute the first video , go to full screen and watch amsterdam grow . 
  they 're controlled by groningen now . 
   flevoland is also a recent addition , yet we 've included it . 
  the map is primarily a toponymic one , not a historical one . 
  explanation by / u/potverdorie . 
  ** disclaimer : ** this is not a perfectly accurate toponymic map of the netherlands , but rather a fantasy-style map based on a liberal interpretation of the toponymy of the capitals and provinces of the netherlands . 
  i 've tried to stay true to the essence of the original meaning of the name while also working in the style of maps for contemporary fantasy works . 
  also note that even between experts , there is still debate and speculation about the toponymic origins of some of the cities and provinces depicted here , as these places were often inhabited long before the first preserved written source mentioning them , and were named in dialects of old languages no longer understood today by anyone but scholars . 
  i 've included an explanation and the main literature source i used for all the names i 've translated : -- ** city in the green fields ** - the origin of the name groningen is unsure . 
  one hypothesis proposes that it derives from old saxon * groen-inge * , meaning ` green fields ' . 
  as the city and the province share the same name , the city is sometimes specified as groningen-stad , which i 've translated as city in the green fields . 
  ; 1999 ] ** realm of the green fields ** - the historical * ommelanden * , meaning ` surrounding lands ' , were the areas controlled by the city of groningen . 
  over time the name groningen started referring to both the city and these surrounding areas . 
  as the city and the province share the same name , the province is sometimes specified as provincie groningen , which i 've translated as realm of the green fields . 
  [ groningen , een stad apart : over het verleden van een eigenzinnige stad ; j. van den broek ; 2007 ] -- ** leeward mound ** - the * warden * part of the name leeuwarden is another name for a terp , a village built on artificial mounds , originating from the old frisian word for ` height ' or ` hill ' . 
  the meaning of the first syllable is contested , but has been proposed to derive from * lij * , ` sheltered from the wind ' , similar to the maritime term * leeward * . 
  [ geschiedkundige beschrijving van leeuwarden , de hoofdstad van friesland ; w. eekhoff ; 1846 ] ** land of the curly-haired folk ** - friesland is named for the germanic tribe whose name perhaps originally meant ` curly-headed ' , from old frisian * frisle * . 
  [ online etymology dictionary ; d. harper , 2015 ] -- ** axe ** - several meanings for assen have been proposed . 
  one hypothesis states a relationship to the old saxon word for ` logging axe ' , * aetsa * . 
  [ nederlandse plaatsnamen : herkomst en historie ; g. van berkel and k. samplonius ; 2006 ] ** three lands ** - the name drenthe derives from the germanic * thrija hantja * ` three lands ' , possibly referring to three folkmoots that composed the region . 
  [ the concise dictionary of world place-names ( 3rd ed . 
  ) ; j. everett-heath ; 2014 ] -- ** ridge ** - zwolle derives its name from the word * suole * , an old word referring to the habitable sand ridge in between two rivers on which the city developed . 
  [ geschiedenis van zwolle ; j. ten hove ; 2005 ] ** across the swift stream ** - overijssel literally translates to ` over-ijssel ' . 
  the name of the river ijssel is thought to derive from a proto-indo-european root ** eis - * ` to move quickly ' .

  [ nederlandse plaatsnamen : herkomst en historie ; g. van berkel en k. samplonius ; 2006 ] ** land of the dragon 's cry ** - gelderland takes its name from the town of geldern in present-day germany . 
  according to the wichard saga , the city was named by the lords of pont who fought and killed a dragon in 878 . 
  they named the town they founded after the death rattle of the dragon : * gelre !, 
  * [ geldersche volksalmanak volumes 21-22 ; nijhoff & amp ; amp ; son ; 1855 ] -- ** lilly 's town ** - lelystad was named after cornelis lely , the engineer of the zuiderzee works . 
  like some other dutch family names , the surname lely is based on the signboard or banner used by the ancestor from whom the family name originates , which in this case displayed a lilly flower . 
  meertens ; 1941 ] ** flowing land ** - flevoland was reclaimed from the sea in the 20th century and named after * flevo lacus * , the lake which existed in that position during roman times . 
  the latin name derives from the indo-european root ** plew - * , ` flow ' . 
  [ nederlands etymologisch woordenboek ; j. de vries ; 1971 ] -- ** city by the downstream crossing ** - utrecht originated as a roman fort built on the frontier of the roman empire , which was named * traiectum * in latin due to it 's location at a river crossing . 
  this became * trecht * in old dutch , but as this name was shared with maastricht , * uut * was added , meaning ` downstream ' . 
  as the city and the province share the same name , the city is sometimes specified as utrecht-stad , which i 've translated as city by the downstream crossing . 
  van veen and n. van der sijs ; 1997 ] ** realm of the downstream crossing ** - the roman fort which would become the city of utrecht already administered the surrounding regions in roman times . 
  over the centuries , the region took the name of the city that administered it . 
  as the city and the province share the same name , the province is sometimes specified as provincie utrecht , which i 've translated as realm of the downstream crossing . 
  [ international dictionary of historic places , vol . 
  2 : northern europe ; t. ring , n. watson and p. schellinger ; 1995 ] -- ** dam in the wetlands ** - amsterdam is named after the dam built on the amstel river . 
  the river itself was named after the wetlands through which it flowed , coming from * aeme * , ` watery ' , and * stelle * , ` place ' . 
  [ uit noordhollands verleden i en ii ; j. brander ; 1956 ] ** abode at the forest sands ** - haarlem is thought to derive from middle dutch * haarloheim * , composed from three parts : * haar * , a word for a sandy area , * loo * , a word for forest , and * heim * , a word to denote a residence . 
  [ historische canon van haarlem ; l. wijnands-van der leij ; 2010 ] ** northern woodland ** - the northern part of the historic region of holland , the name of which is derived from the middle dutch * holtland * , meaning ` wooded land ' .

  the city was named * 's - hertogenbosch * , ` the duke 's forest ' . 
  camps , 1995 ] ** quagmire ** - brabant derives from the old dutch * braecbant * , a composition of * braec * , meaning ` marshy ' , and * bant * , meaning ` region ' . 
  as `` marshy region '' and other alternative literal translations sounded very contrived , i chose to translate it as `` quagmire '' in the end , which i felt fits both the meaning and the sound of * braecbant * . 
  bouwstenen voor de geschiedenis van baarle ; h. joosen ; 1946 ] -- ** river god 's crossing ** - the name of maastricht is derived from the latin * traiectum ad mosam * , meaning ` river crossing at the meuse river ' . 
  this became * trecht * in old dutch , but as this name was shared with utrecht , * maas * was added , the dutch name for the meuse river . 
  this name originates from celtic and possibly referred to a river deity .
