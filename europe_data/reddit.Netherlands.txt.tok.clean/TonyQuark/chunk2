  if we can create space for bicycle lanes , everyone can . 
  * [ brief history ] ( http://youtu.be/xubdf9jyj7o ) * [ a dutch cyclist 's point of view ( a must-see if you 're interested -- debunks common objections -- see blue box top right appearing on occassion ) ] ( http://youtu.be/hor6zm_yziw ) * [ seattle city planners analyzing dutch infrastructure ( warning : this video is long ) ] ( http://youtu.be/l0ga901oge4 ) ^ ( edit : added a video ), 
  yes , we foresaw this in the 16th century . 
  yes , we agree on this . 
  i understand what you 're saying , but my point was that race and nationality are n't the same thing . 
  exactly the part of my comment you were n't quoting . 
  frisson : shudders , chills , goosebumps, 
  like black polish people do n't exist ? 
  you guys are both mixing up race with nationality . 
   a provincial sub i see what you did there . 
  / r/dutch seems quite inactive though . 
  the last post is from over two weeks ago . 
  i think the most active users have already moved to / r/thenetherlands . 
  plus it 's sort of a reddit convention to use the country 's name , not the demonym , for the national sub . 
  what kind of reports do you mean ? 
  traffic reports ? 
  i 'm just going to ignore that 18-year old brony from now on . 
  thanks , edited comment . 
  / u/thenetherlands is more internationally oriented . 
  plus that mod is already demonstrating great willingness to let the community shape the sub . 
  go over there and have a look for yourself !, 
   also , / r/nederland has no mods ( it was abandoned ) and it takes a while for the reddit admins to reassign subs like these . 
  but a user did put in a request for transfer already at / r/redditrequest . 
  hijacking top comment for visibility : housewarming party with all the vla you want at [ ** / r / * the * netherlands ** ] ( / r/thenetherlands ) !, 
  ^ ( edit : / r / -- not / u / ), 
  but / r/thenetherlands is public . 
   the washington post is a bad source , a bastion for truther propaganda ? 
  how did you even infer this ? 
  the truther stuff was about the globalization site you mentioned . 
   you never wanted to read what you already know yes , the whole world is out to get you . 
   you feign disinterest . 
  i 'm replying out of courtesy and surprise . 
  let me quote myself from earlier posts : * just responding to your words , is all . 
  * why would there not be 1/3 of the crimean population for remaining with ukraine ? 
  * i 'm not saying anything . 
  if you look at my comments , i 'm only asking why people in crimea might or might not want to remain with ukraine . 
  * you keep going off on tangents . 
  * sorry , not interested . 
  ** my only point was the three options for the referendum . 
  you keep dragging other stuff in this . 
  i 'm not that interested . 
  you can sigh all you want . 
  that truther stuff is an instant red flag . 
  also , quite ironically the wiki section you 've linked to has a warning about the sources . 
  that said , what do i care if ned promoted democracy in ukraine ? 
  good for them . 
  all i was arguing for was giving the people of ukraine three choices in stead of two . 
  you keep adding stuff to this conversation . 
  please make a constructive post in / r/euromaidan or / r/europe . 
  someone over there might be willing to argue with you about this . 
  i 'm simply not that interested . 
   before you discount this because it is a blog or supposedly bias because of this line i got suspicious . 
  so i checked out the rest of the site first . 
  i see the `` 9/11 '' section and i 'm thinking ` that 's a popular subject for conspiracy theories ' . 
  aaaaand it 's truther stuff . 
  sorry , not interested . 
  i try . 
  i enjoy making others feel good , challenging them and poking fun at them and myself in the process . 
  i also like avoiding the obvious . 
  that said , i 'm not going to tell you what i tagged you with . 
  but i do appreciate the compliment . 
   i guess you used res to tag me ? 
  yep , did indeed . 
  i tag people if i see a noteworthy comment , positive or negative . 
  i mostly use it to play jokes on people . 
  one user commented on how his friend was afraid of oven mitts for instance , so for a while i would make jokes about oven mitts when i came across one of his comments . 
  at some point he stopped enjoying the jokes , so i stopped making them . 
   1/3 is n't a majority . 
  are you saying [ ... ] allowing a minority to dictate the outcome ? 
  i 'm not saying anything . 
  if you look at my comments , i 'm only asking why people in crimea might or might not want to remain with ukraine . 
  you said there 's 0 % of that being possible . 
  so i 'm asking why 0 % and not 33,3 % ? 
  do you even know until you 've asked ? 
  that 's my point . 
   have you not heard suppose i have not . 
  what 's your source ? 
  all i 'm doing is ask questions . 
  you keep going off on tangents . 
  i commented on toddlers & tiaras being on tv in the states . 
  you said the toddlers ' parents need to be electrocuted . 
  i thought that was kind of harsh , but i decided to run with it and jokingly pointed out there 's no capital punishment in europe . 
  you seriously engaged me on that issue . 
  i then made a sarcastic comment about how we burn people at the stake in europe . 
  then you made some crazy comment about injecting babies with heroin . 
  at which point i decided if this would happen to me in a bar i would back away and pocket-dial 911 . 
  so the reddit equivalent would be to not respond any more . 
  :p [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1lbyn8/how_is_spanish_bullfighting_regarded_by_other/cby1y2v ) ( i was not the one downvoting btw ), 
  i think it was just a stupid joke . 
  speaking of stupid jokes , do you remember the last time we talked ? 
  and 16 downvotes . 
   i think there is going to be a lot of unhappy people on both sides . 
  did you read that quote ? 
  what i 'm asking is , why would there not be 1/3 of the crimean population * for * remaining with ukraine ? 
  i know at least one russian crimean writer opposes russia 's actions . 
   this shit sandwich was brought to you by the sandwich artists at the u.s. state department . 
  source ? 
   ask . 
  okay . 
  i do n't care .
