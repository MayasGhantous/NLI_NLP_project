  explanation by / u/potverdorie . 
  ** disclaimer : ** this is not a perfectly accurate toponymic map of the netherlands , but rather a fantasy-style map based on a liberal interpretation of the toponymy of the capitals and provinces of the netherlands . 
  i 've tried to stay true to the essence of the original meaning of the name while also working in the style of maps for contemporary fantasy works . 
  also note that even between experts , there is still debate and speculation about the toponymic origins of some of the cities and provinces depicted here , as these places were often inhabited long before the first preserved written source mentioning them , and were named in dialects of old languages no longer understood today by anyone but scholars . 
  i 've included an explanation and the main literature source i used for all the names i 've translated : -- ** city in the green fields ** - the origin of the name groningen is unsure . 
  one hypothesis proposes that it derives from old saxon * groen-inge * , meaning ` green fields ' . 
  as the city and the province share the same name , the city is sometimes specified as groningen-stad , which i 've translated as city in the green fields . 
  ; 1999 ] ** realm of the green fields ** - the historical * ommelanden * , meaning ` surrounding lands ' , were the areas controlled by the city of groningen . 
  over time the name groningen started referring to both the city and these surrounding areas . 
  as the city and the province share the same name , the province is sometimes specified as provincie groningen , which i 've translated as realm of the green fields . 
  [ groningen , een stad apart : over het verleden van een eigenzinnige stad ; j. van den broek ; 2007 ] -- ** leeward mound ** - the * warden * part of the name leeuwarden is another name for a terp , a village built on artificial mounds , originating from the old frisian word for ` height ' or ` hill ' . 
  the meaning of the first syllable is contested , but has been proposed to derive from * lij * , ` sheltered from the wind ' , similar to the maritime term * leeward * . 
  [ geschiedkundige beschrijving van leeuwarden , de hoofdstad van friesland ; w. eekhoff ; 1846 ] ** land of the curly-haired folk ** - friesland is named for the germanic tribe whose name perhaps originally meant ` curly-headed ' , from old frisian * frisle * . 
  [ online etymology dictionary ; d. harper , 2015 ] -- ** axe ** - several meanings for assen have been proposed . 
  one hypothesis states a relationship to the old saxon word for ` logging axe ' , * aetsa * . 
  [ nederlandse plaatsnamen : herkomst en historie ; g. van berkel and k. samplonius ; 2006 ] ** three lands ** - the name drenthe derives from the germanic * thrija hantja * ` three lands ' , possibly referring to three folkmoots that composed the region . 
  [ the concise dictionary of world place-names ( 3rd ed . 
  ) ; j. everett-heath ; 2014 ] -- ** ridge ** - zwolle derives its name from the word * suole * , an old word referring to the habitable sand ridge in between two rivers on which the city developed . 
  [ geschiedenis van zwolle ; j. ten hove ; 2005 ] ** across the swift stream ** - overijssel literally translates to ` over-ijssel ' . 
  the name of the river ijssel is thought to derive from a proto-indo-european root ** eis - * ` to move quickly ' . 
  [ etymologisch woordenboek ; j. de vries ; 1959 ] -- ** home of eagles ** - arnhem is a combination of the germanic words * arnu * , ` eagle ' , and * heem * , ` home ' . 
  [ nederlandse plaatsnamen : herkomst en historie ; g. van berkel en k. samplonius ; 2006 ] ** land of the dragon 's cry ** - gelderland takes its name from the town of geldern in present-day germany . 
  according to the wichard saga , the city was named by the lords of pont who fought and killed a dragon in 878 . 
  they named the town they founded after the death rattle of the dragon : * gelre !, 
  * [ geldersche volksalmanak volumes 21-22 ; nijhoff & amp ; son ; 1855 ] -- ** lilly 's town ** - lelystad was named after cornelis lely , the engineer of the zuiderzee works . 
  like some other dutch family names , the surname lely is based on the signboard or banner used by the ancestor from whom the family name originates , which in this case displayed a lilly flower . 
  meertens ; 1941 ] ** flowing land ** - flevoland was reclaimed from the sea in the 20th century and named after * flevo lacus * , the lake which existed in that position during roman times . 
  the latin name derives from the indo-european root ** plew - * , ` flow ' . 
  [ nederlands etymologisch woordenboek ; j. de vries ; 1971 ] -- ** city by the downstream crossing ** - utrecht originated as a roman fort built on the frontier of the roman empire , which was named * traiectum * in latin due to it 's location at a river crossing . 
  this became * trecht * in old dutch , but as this name was shared with maastricht , * uut * was added , meaning ` downstream ' . 
  as the city and the province share the same name , the city is sometimes specified as utrecht-stad , which i 've translated as city by the downstream crossing . 
  van veen and n. van der sijs ; 1997 ] ** realm of the downstream crossing ** - the roman fort which would become the city of utrecht already administered the surrounding regions in roman times . 
  over the centuries , the region took the name of the city that administered it . 
  as the city and the province share the same name , the province is sometimes specified as provincie utrecht , which i 've translated as realm of the downstream crossing . 
  [ international dictionary of historic places , vol . 
  2 : northern europe ; t. ring , n. watson and p. schellinger ; 1995 ] -- ** dam in the wetlands ** - amsterdam is named after the dam built on the amstel river . 
  the river itself was named after the wetlands through which it flowed , coming from * aeme * , ` watery ' , and * stelle * , ` place ' . 
  [ uit noordhollands verleden i en ii ; j. brander ; 1956 ] ** abode at the forest sands ** - haarlem is thought to derive from middle dutch * haarloheim * , composed from three parts : * haar * , a word for a sandy area , * loo * , a word for forest , and * heim * , a word to denote a residence . 
  [ historische canon van haarlem ; l. wijnands-van der leij ; 2010 ] ** northern woodland ** - the northern part of the historic region of holland , the name of which is derived from the middle dutch * holtland * , meaning ` wooded land ' .

  [ oxford english dictionary ; 2015 ] -- ** middle keep ** - middelburg originated as a fortification , and was named * middelburgh * , ` middle keep ' , because it was located in between two other fortifications , * duinburgh * and * souburgh * . 
  henderikx , a. mars ; 1995 ] ** sealand ** - zeeland translates to sea-land .

  [ te ara - the encyclopedia of new zealand ; j. wilson ; 2007 ] -- ** duke 's forest ** - the duke of brabant founded a new town located on some forested dunes , and soon thereafter granted it city rights in 1184 . 
  the city was named * 's - hertogenbosch * , ` the duke 's forest ' . 
  camps , 1995 ] ** quagmire ** - brabant derives from the old dutch * braecbant * , a composition of * braec * , meaning ` marshy ' , and * bant * , meaning ` region ' . 
  as `` marshy region '' and other alternative literal translations sounded very contrived , i chose to translate it as `` quagmire '' in the end , which i felt fits both the meaning and the sound of * braecbant * . 
  bouwstenen voor de geschiedenis van baarle ; h. joosen ; 1946 ] -- ** river god 's crossing ** - the name of maastricht is derived from the latin * traiectum ad mosam * , meaning ` river crossing at the meuse river ' . 
  this became * trecht * in old dutch , but as this name was shared with utrecht , * maas * was added , the dutch name for the meuse river . 
  this name originates from celtic and possibly referred to a river deity .

  nice work !, 
   a little late , but i 'm thinking you could also consider replacing ` east germany ' with prussia . 
  ( by the way , there 's a slight spelling error in ` niedersach ** s ** en ' . 
  in case you really care about that . ), 
  great map !, 
  some alternate naming suggestions i came up with : * atlantic france -  aquitania * mediterranean france -  provence * north italy -  cisalpine * middle italy -  rome ( like you did with paris ) * south italy -  ionia or magna graecia ( the roman name for southern italy ) * spain -  andalusia, 
  some people even wipe back to front . 
  really weird to me . 
  respectful, 
  i just clicked your username , that 's all . 
  anyway , bye !, 
  have fun in your own little world . 
  lol . 
  i took a look at your post history . 
  do you even have one comment above 10 points ? 
  nobody cares about what you 're saying , man . 
  not everything , but i find your downvote pretty funny . 
  you ca n't even tell when an atheist like me is joking , because you take everything very seriously . 
  i find your post unfunny . 
  edit on behalf of allah . 
  i masturbate to shakira commie law . 
  i hope / u/jebusgobson will institute it on / r/europe as well . 
  muh stonings !, 
  so , this discussion is now down to ' i know what you are , but what am i ? ', 
  always a good time to sign off . 
  translation : `` i 'm just talking shit , let me . '', 
  how about , in stead of a downvote and a non-answer , you come up with a counter-argument ? 
  actually , the roman empire allowing polytheism and local culture is what it allowed it to grow . 
  it 's what made it successful . 
  please do n't reappropriate history to serve your populist politics . 
  thanks for the smile . 
  we 're thorough . 
  determining guilt is the next step . 
  yeah , not really though . 
  it 's a running gag that somehow finland is always one position above us in those kinds of lists , while in reality it varies a lot . 
  it 's just fun to hate on finland , because , why would anyone hate on finland ? 
  see , this is why the dutch hate the finnish !, 
  ( we do n't . 
  i said ` known criminals ' , not people with ' a criminal past ' . 
  as in , people who are wanted . 
  actually the italian ` ndrangheta are the largest problem . 
  that does n't mean we should allow in other criminals , though . 
  petty or not . 
  i do n't know about ghent , but to be fair , if they have to show their id , known criminals can be denied entry . 
  fuck you for showing some basic consideration and decency !, 
  well , if we were to get technical , that red needs to be darker ... you know what , i like it too . 
  yep , controlled flooding is the way to do it .
