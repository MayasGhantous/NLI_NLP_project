  nobody tell him about the 17th century , folks !, 
  move on , nothing to see here !, 
  the tower is also know as ` zendmast lopik ' . 
  works better if you speak dutch . 
  no , * you 're * a lopik !, 
  and the [ gerbrandytoren ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerbrandytoren ) is the tallest structure ( 372m ) . 
  too many nazis . 
  how about the hate for polish people then ?

  not enough overlays . 
  fuck germany for showing sympathy , right ? 
  damn , some people will find a fault with anything . 
  thatsthejoke.jpg notice i did not actually edit ... aw , fuck it . 
  so is iceland . 
  no , that 'll happen tomorrow when ~ ~ brussels ~ ~ belgium beats wales . 
  i am still for belgium , but the netherlands is red , white and blue too , so i 'm happy . 
   why did n't he put rashford on 15-20 minutes sooner ? 
  this is what all english fans will be wondering for years to come . 
  especially seeing how he made three dashes in four minutes . 
  euro 2016 : electric boogaloo - brussels is coming for you !, 
  yet he pretty much consistently votes right-wing . 
  friendly warning : let your arguments be good enough on their own , do n't resort to insults please . 
  you can do better .

  that 's interesting . 
  can you name a ( uk ) party that advocated this ? 
  surely not ukip ? 
   indeed the whole ` the muslims are taking over ' nonsense seems to increasingly be coming from very pro-eu voices . 
  i really ca n't make this connection . 
  how do you figure ? 
  you do n't have to feel personally responsible . 
  indeed . 
  then again , how would we enforce such a rule if one were to make a photograph with the curtain of the voting booth closed ? 
  you did n't , it 's just that so many people actually think that . 
  the voting council wanted to make it illegal , but a judge and later also a commission ruled that it was legal to do . 
  i agree with you in principle , but then again , people can still `` get bought '' without having to take a photograph . 
  the `` stemfie '' ( voting selfie ) was n't declared illegal in the netherlands by the way . 
  in 2014 , people were talking selfies with their voting ballot . 
  the voting council wanted to make it illegal , but a judge and later also a commission ruled that it was legal to do . 
   where in amsterdam ? 
  right , the netherlands = amsterdam . 
  no idea . 
  un-nsfw-ed it . 
  yeah we felt bad for you , so we just let you win one time . 
  thanks , we try . 
  banned for posting personal information . 
  what if i were to call you a walloon ? 
  it 's a running gag on / r/thenetherlands . 
  a completely irrational one-sided competition that the finns do n't even know or care about . 
  started when some comedians did a skit about fact-checking and how finland is `` always '' one spot above us in lists like these , usually finland being number 1 and the netherlands being number 2 . 
  you 'll also see lists on which the spots are reversed and then the comments will say something like ` take that , finland ! ', 
  it just strikes me that way and if you search for the name on google , belgian adresses pop up confirming it . 
  i 'd say it 's flemish . 
  belgian dutch ( flemish ) . 
  lol , personal attack after personal attack . 
  yes , i 'm cheap for not responding to a personal attack . 
  heh , always with the personal attacks . 
  i could easily claim jesse klaver is also a popular politician . 
  but he 's not the only member of his own party . 
  ( yes , wilders is one of two members of the pvv , the other one being the wilders foundation : it 's a completely anti-democratic party . ), 
  there are no stupid questions , only stupid answers . 
  no , that 's swedish , or another scandinavian name . 
  also , ` vander ' = belgian ( flemish ) . 
  in dutch it would be ` van der ' . 
  it means ` of the ' . 
  but many americanized dutch names lost the spaces , so it 's not always apparent . 
  also , if you see ` aa ' , it 's probably dutch , and ` ae ' is probably belgian ( flemish ) . 
  ` van der aalst ' is dutch , ` vander aelst ' is flemish . 
  since when is a quarter of the country the most popular ? 
  van = dutch , von = german . 
  2/3 of tourists come for the art and culture , the rest have other reasons , including smoking weed . 
  i guess it 's all * you 've * got to work with . 
  cda was traditionally strong in the southern countryside , sgp in the [ dutch bible belt .

  for other parties it 's a mixture . 
  i should have said the ban on digital counting was reversed . 
  the ban on counting machines was reversed . 
  they comment on the_subreddit ... 
  well , she is part german . 
  great post , op !, 
  actually most people on that subreddit are centrists . 
  that 's only left-leaning if you vote pvv .
