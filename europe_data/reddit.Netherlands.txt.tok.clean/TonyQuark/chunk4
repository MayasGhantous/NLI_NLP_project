  he could say that without sounding judgmental , but then again , your comment consists of nothing but a judgmental remark , so i guess that evens it out . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  8 years prior i was playing [ air combat on playstation ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ea/air_combat_cover.jpg ) . 
  i 'm guessing you are n't replying to the person you think you are . 
  the us does n't import russian gas . 
  ( technically the netherlands do n't have to either , but we 'd rather not use up all of our own gas in a few decades . ), 
  `` hi , i am a prince from nigeria . 
  i need to transfer gas to europe , but i need help paying for it with a small amount of gas first . 
  can you send me some of your european gas ? 
  i will then transfer the large amount and reimburse you and give you a percentage of the gas . '', 
   most of that gas half of it , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  true , but the choice between a few cracks in the houses of some groningers or a potential nuclear fallout should n't be that hard . 
  this is an old thread , but i could n't let this pass for dutch humor . 
  [ here 's the best comedian of the netherlands , hans teeuwen , performing in london . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii-fohgwpw0&amp;feature=share&amp;list=pld962c639c608d56b ), 
  obviously the * fighter * drone is for baking cakes . 
   the nos which has kind of taken a nose dive in recent years what makes you say that ? 
   so i expect their analysis of a lower quality than the polish news where ukraine is an even more important story . 
  i expect the polish analysis to be more opinionated , actually . 
  do n't build dangerous nuclear power plants , import dutch gas !, 
  `` even '' here in nl ? 
  second most press freedom in the world over here . 
  it 's not helping ukraine though . 
  yep , sold them to the finns . 
  we do have some actually , but they 're mothballed . 
  apaches , cv90 's and computers are considered more useful by the secretary of defense . 
  the army seems to miss having leopard 2 's though , so they plan to lease them from germany . 
   hitler had no navy . 
  you seem to have forgotten about the famous u-boats . 
  as well as all the battleships , cruisers , minesweepers , etc. 
  you do realise the tanks are at the poland-ukraine border , in poland , right ? 
  a lot of people who are n't native english speakers speak the language well enough to have a conversation , but not well enough to pick up on tone or subtleties , especially when written . 
  indeed . 
  the hair helps . 
   i 'm all about polandball . 
  oh man , i feel for you . 
  is that a chronic illness ? 
  that 's one of those polandball words , is n't it ? 
  please do n't . 
  the copenhagen zoo would like your contact information in order to hire you as a pr consultant . 
  so you croatians can drop in a wine gum and steal it ? 
  [ the simpsons did n't help . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/fujgf2grrus ), 
  sounds reasonable . 
  but the french actually fought on the side of the americans ( as did the dutch , spanish and mysorians ) during the american war of independence . 
  you 'd think the americans would be grateful for that . 
  white flags are used to indicate surrender . 
  france supposedly surrenders a lot during wars . 
  people who take the joke seriously never heard of napoleon . 
  or the fact that france won most of their wars . 
  my point is that to ` the other side ' , ` the other side ' is ` the other side ' as well . 
  example : some people are left-wing and some are right-wing , politically . 
  both of them are convinced their ideas are best for the country . 
   there is a division between the ones that love ukraine and the ones that do n't . 
  that 's a non-argument , since both sides can say and believe that . 
  the fact that it 's a religious leader saying it does n't give it any more credibility . 
  so why are you glad that the us officials are engaging the un , if you do n't think very highly of the un ? 
  i mean , would n't it be easier then for the us officials to talk to the eu because then there 's few decision makers involved ? 
  right . 
  well , that call was typically one of those sensationalist news stories that keeps dragging on , while the actual people involved know what 's going on . 
  as soon as i read it , i thought it was a waste of my time to even get mildly upset about . 
   so i 'll take your word for it . 
  bad , or honest ? 
  or just different editor/journalist ? 
  [ ukraine crisis : us and eu move to impose sanctions -- live updates ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2014/feb/19/ukraine-25-dead-after-police-storm-kiev-protest-camp-live-updates ),

  it 's not so silly if you think about it . 
  if you were to `` invent '' a state nowadays you would n't make the head of state a hereditary position . 
  the netherlands is also a kingdom , but like in spain , i guess , the king 's position is ( largely ) ceremonial and the pm and cabinet have ministerial responsibility . 
  that 's why forming a republic ( like the netherlands once were , among the first in the world ) is n't a high priority on anyone 's list . 
  of course , we do n't have as many separatists as spain does ( only one province , really , who know they would n't last a week without the rest of the country -- i 'm looking at you , friesland ) . 
  because the american tax system is broken . 
  so basically what you 're saying is that they should have played simcity as kids ? 
  let me put this in a language you understand : `` c'est le principe . '', 
  not the issue . 
  it 's about the principle . 
  since you did n't answer , i guess building church steeples is not banned ? 
  i meant you might not have had much practice . 
   is the king not a mostly ceremonial position in spain ? 
  of all of the eastern european countries , i 've always thought highest of the czech republic . 
  pure personal bias , obviously . 
  it 's quite sad to hear about so much corruption . 
  there 's lots of politicians in the house who are n't career politicians . 
  the most capable specialists in a certain field will often serve under and advise ministers as state secretaries . 
  fine , it 's the minarets , not the mosques . 
  does that also go for church steeples ? 
  actually warren buffet wants to pay more taxes and bill gates gave half of his money to charity . 
  if you do n't mind mass bankruptcy , no protection for low wage workers who survive on tips , a huge income disparaty , then yeah , the american system works . 
  peasant food . 
  sounds good . 
  especially hodgepodge is good in winter . 
  makes me wonder , if the irish and the dutch share these dishes , why have n't the english caught on ( their food is horrible ) ? 
  actually , no . 
  our current pm studied history and the rest of the cabinet have mostly studied law or economics . 
  but most of them have been in a political fraternity and have been in politics for most of their careers . 
  the point is that they invested lots of their time and effort into becoming politicians . 
   perhaps votes should be counted by input , i.e. 
  every dollar paid in taxes gives you one vote so , you mean the usa , where companies are people and money equals votes , basically ?
