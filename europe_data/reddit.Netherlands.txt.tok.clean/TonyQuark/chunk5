  where big business wins over average citizens ? 
  where socialism equals communism equals evil ? 
  where poor people and minorities are systematically discriminated against by voter id laws and redistricting ? 
  either every religion can build houses or worship or none of them can . 
  you do n't get to pick what version is best . 
  why ? 
  because the representatives studied political science and it 's their job ? 
  because they are studing dossiers daily ? 
  because they can be bothered to look beyond the `` no more foreigners '' argument ? 
  hear , hear . 
  spain was a dictatorship not too long ago . 
  also , celebrating lots of olympic medals . 
  yep , ridiculously sweet grape juice . 
   suck its mother the word you 're looking for is suckle . 
  immigrant ? 
  indeed . 
  i imagine aside from getting decent posts , over which you 'll not have much control , setting up the site for easy crawling would be the most important driver of traffic . 
  fair enough . 
  i still think you are underestimating this project , but i applaud you for the effort nonetheless . 
  best of luck to you !, 
  private messages , okay . 
  but passwords are n't needed and statistics can be mapped anyway . 
  but okay , say op gets the site working , then i 'm sure a decent pen tester can find and exploit a database injection in no time . 
  how are you going to handle traffic , pay for the servers and protect against exploits ? 
  you do realise it would be a public website , right ? 
  all i see in that video is a bunch of conservative villagers complaining that their town is growing . 
  `` ooh , there 's more apartment buildings here now ! '', 
  i have n't tried jamaican , korean , yugoslavian , creole or irish , but i tend to agree with the rest . 
  for me , though , indonesian takes the cake !, 
  ( by the way , there 's no cake . ), 
  what would you consider a typically irish dish ? 
  both our peoples love potatoes !, 
  seriously though , what food did you like best ? 
  heheh , same here . 
  i do n't think my last joke translated pretty well by the way , if you do n't understand dutch , but i guess that 's alright . 
  what nationality are you though ? 
  sure , did n't mean to take away from that , but i wo n't expect a bigot to `` accurately '' discriminate . 
  a sign of the times would be roosevelt 's disapproval of `` hyphenated americanism '' . 
  conveniently forgetting the country 's origins for a moment . 
  the anglo-dutch wars , for those of you who were wondering . 
  i did see the word , i just assumed it was a reference to new kids , a show about anti-social youth from a dutch village that got popular in both the netherlands and germany for a while . 
  i do n't even like it that much , but i thought i 'd play along . 
  hence my response . 
  i 'm not saying i agree , i 'm just telling you why he might be downvoted , which includes * that particular turn of phrase * . 
  i already told you why i upvoted him and downvoted your original comment ( something i have n't done for your consecutive comments , by the way ) . 
  and yes , sure , i 'm an atheist ( humanist ) . 
  i do n't like religion or bigots , so i wo n't defend either . 
  i 'm fairly certain this is where his confusion stems from . 
  why do you make the peace sign on pictures ? 
  `` because it 's a pose japanese people do . '', 
  do you know thejapanchanneldcom on youtube ? 
  discrimination might play a part . 
  this guy explains it pretty fairly , from what i can tell . 
   they have their own nation that 's exactly why i was wondering . 
  plus the fact that there 's like 650,000 cypriotic greeks on that island . 
   i think it 's really about what the greeks think though . 
  well , the `` as a ... '' response is seen as annoying and the overwhelming majority on / r/europe are atheists , according to a recent poll . 
  that might have something to do with the relatively more downvotes . 
  and yes , there 's probably some bigots too . 
  that is n't even an actual swearword in dutch . 
  :p i 'm guessing you 're german , and you do n't know what i was referring to in my reply to your `` jonge '' ? 
  might greek cypriots serve as a better example ? 
  bigots exist everywhere . 
  i wonder if `` fyr '' is a cognate of `` fire '' . 
  anyway , `` funhouse '' makes more sense if you think about it . 
   also , google translate seems to think it means `` gazebo '' ( gardenhouse ) . 
  i guess that goes for when she does n't shave ? 
  he 's got approx . 
  38 upvotes and 21 downvotes . 
  i upvoted him because he contributed to the conversation . 
  i downvoted your original post exactly because it did not . 
  could you make me some cheese with that ? 
   to all the people who called me some variant of a `` stupid religious american '' i count [ one reply ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1y1noe/denmark_bans_jewish_and_muslim_ritual_slaughter/cfglvl5 ) talking about the reason people might be against circumcision . 
  i count [ a second reply ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1y1noe/denmark_bans_jewish_and_muslim_ritual_slaughter/cfh0kou ) asking if you are religious , and that guy is an american himself . 
  i do n't know how many replies have been deleted , but are you sure you did n't overreact ? 
  translation : `` there are communists in the funhouse '' ( referring to periods . ), 
  my use of the word '' * systematically * '' implies government involvement . 
  i have a crazy theory : if you systematically exclude people they tend to not care about you very much in return . 
   i ca n't respect american liberals or anyone who sympathizes with them , because they want to flood our countries with immigrants and destroy our culture and our nation . 
  did you know the us consists of immigrants only , save for natives ? 
  how many immigrants supported by american liberals have you encountered in the czech republic ? 
  are you a moron ? 
  did you know the largest group of foreigners in sweden are finns ? 
  why would you be anti-gay ? 
  are you a moron ? 
  did you know under stalin people who did n't agree with the regime disappeared without explanation ? 
  did you know all people are genetically not very different from one another at all ? 
  again , are you a * fucking * moron ? 
   lux would be inferior to belgium -  netherlands -  germany -  uk -  us -  freedoms according to a [ report by reporters without borders ] ( http://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php ) on freedom : * 1 . 
  finland * 2 . 
  netherlands * 23 . 
  usa  sounds like bitch talk to me . 
  sure , if you mean my point was completely anecdotal , then you 're right . 
  i 've overheard and talked to belgians speaking about not being too particularly fond of their own country . 
  perhaps because it 's kind of artificial and relatively new ( 1830 ) . 
  yet all of the flemish ( dutch speaking ) people i 've talked to insist they do not wish to join the netherlands . 
  again , that 's all hearsay . 
  here 's a [ wikipedia article on it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_netherlands ) if you 'd like to know more . 
  but as i said , i love the way belgians speak dutch . 
  i also love the beer , the cheese , the chocolate , the waffles and the atomium .
