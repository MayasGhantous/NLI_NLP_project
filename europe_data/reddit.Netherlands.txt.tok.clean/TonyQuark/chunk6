  does n't matter , everyone 's corrupt anyway . 
  in addition : keep in mind that when talking about euthanasia under 16 , we 're only dealing with a handful of individuals on a yearly basis . 
  all of this discussion is about allowing only a few people to be able to not be criminalised for choosing this option when their suffering is unbearable . 
  in teeth . 
  they are kind of suffering from an inferiority complex . 
  i think dutch sounds more beautiful when they speak it though . 
  not necessarily more logical , but more beautiful indeed . 
  i 'm basically saying the netherlands would be a man if belgium was a woman . 
  go fuck some water then , waterfuck . 
  i wish they 'd get rid of erdogan already . 
  that guy is nothing but bad news . 
  i think atat\u00fcrk would be spinning in his grave . 
  at this rate , turkey will never join the eu . 
  the dip and the recovery are both quicker in sweden . 
  i 'd day the swedish economy just responded more to changes in either direction . 
  [ simple fact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkey ) : turkey is located mostly on anatolia in western asia , and on east thrace in southeastern europe . 
  not defending anyone here , but `` islamist '' means muslim extremist . 
  actually from that graph you can see poland is doing better than the world average . 
  your country did n't particularly do well in 2009 ; it took a hit in 2008 , like all european countries .

   hot dogs with macaroni is this some kind of edgy fusion cooking , or just completely random stuff thrown together ? 
  that 's why you should only go to birthday parties that start at 8 in the evening .

  us dutchies . 
  `` the most truthful answer . '', 
  source ? 
  the netherlands is a hub too . 
  rotterdam harbor alone , for example , causes heavy highway traffic . 
  we just spend way more money on roads , in stead of fixing a pot hole here and there . 
  money that partially comes from road taxes , which are based on vehicle weight . 
  no toll booths either , by the way, 
  it 's not necessarily scandalous , it just screams `` consumerism '' . 
  in other words , it comes across as having crap shoved down your throat and being so happy about it , that you joyously evangelize said crap to other equally gullible people , because the guy who told you about it was being funny . 
  sure they do . 
  we just do n't go around discussing some corporation 's marketing strategy at the water cooler . 
  i just think people who 're speaking a second , third and/or fourth language ca n't be expected to pick up on every little nuance in those very languages . 
  plus , there 's a difference between writing and speaking a language . 
  i 'm fairly decent at both english and dutch , but my german and french leave something to be desired . 
  seeing as how you 're canadian , do you speak french at all ? 
  nah , i 'm just a dumb dutchman who thinks commercials are annoying and `` you must be fun at parties '' is an outdated response . 
  bang your head on your desk some more , perhaps you 'll get it . 
  you know very well `` commercials during the super bowl half-time '' is a conversation piece in the us . 
  i know of nobody who discussed the mercedes benz commercial during the last champions league game . 
  obviously not , since my parties are n't sponsored by the highest bidder . 
  as a canadian trying to learn ukrainian you should know speaking another language requires practice . 
  making fun of someone does n't help . 
  in fact , it 's even worse than blatantly correcting someone . 
  at least they could 've learned from that . 
  right now , you 're just being an ass . 
  was expecting the sub to be about making fun of nazis . 
  did n't expect a meteorology sub . 
  very apt name . 
  who actually watches that crap ? 
  if i 'd want to laugh , i 'd watch comedy . 
  i like the states , but relying on businesses pushing a certain product to entertain you , has to be the most whoring way of enjoying television . 
  besides , how about the game ? 
  is n't that what it was about in the first place ? 
  right on . 
  but come on , you 've got to admit your federal government is moving ridiculously slow and is highly inefficient . 
  for instance ; your highways suck . 
  whenever i cross the border from the netherlands into belgium i go from smooth sailing to stormy weather . 
  your roads give a whole new meaning to very open asphalt concrete ( zoab ) . 
  yeah , i guessed as much . 
  i am psychic , you see . 
  the person doing the invoicing gets to claim expenses , not the other way around .

   `` the name was added by the media : the banana shape was pointed out at a press-conference by jacques ch\u00e9r\u00e8que , a government minister ; the colour was then given to it by an artist at the * nouvel observateur * , in an article by josette alia three days later which baptised the * banane bleue * . '', 
   it is said that the banana was rendered as blue because it represented the core of europe , and the flag of europe is largely blue . 
  other sources claim that the colour refers to the clothing of industrial workers ( `` blue collar '' ) . 
  yup .

  here 's hoping for a sec-like eu regulator , then . 
  thanks again for the explanation . 
  i was going to ask you if you know about / r/economics but it seems from a quick look at your history that you already do . 
  there 's also / r/askeconomists and / r/askeconomics , but those are quite underpopulated . 
  you may find / r/asksocialscience interesting , though .
