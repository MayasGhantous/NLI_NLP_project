  i wo n't go into that unless you 'd be interested though . 
  in terms of sensitivity to minorities and women ( who are actually a majority , but still have to cope with discriminatory practises , of which i am guilty too albeit only mentally ) , i think americans are actually at the world 's forefront . 
  a good , recent example is one of when the other day i was arguing with a friend that zwarte piet , the dutch version of santa 's elf ( who 's a white dude in blackface ) had racist origins and even though that friend 's not racist , the practice of dressing up like that itself would be regarded as such by basically every brit and us american . 
  then again , the flipside is basically fox news and their war on christmas , white santa and white jesus . 
   so yeah , i 'm glad to live in the netherlands . 
  we 're not too sensitive , but we wo n't tolerate bigotry either . 
  one thing i am glad for though , is the fact that we 're not as litigious as people in the states . 
  recently a redditor i talked to said his/her theory was that because healthcare in the states is lacking , people see suing anyone who might even remotely be responsible for their accident or whatever , as a good way to get out from under paying the medical bills . 
  and that 's how you get ` ambulance chasers ' . 
  the reverse is true in europe , where prison sentences often might not really correspond to the crime commited ( read : perps are getting off pretty easily sometimes ) . 
  something completely different about the french though ; i think in graphic design and other creative arts , they belong to the best in europe . 
  there 's something about their way of expressing themselves that 's quite unique and i admire that aspect greatly . 
  obviously this also is a generalization , but is n't everything when said about an entire nation ? 
  well , i for one * have * been to the states . 
   in fact , i 've stood on top of one of the twin towers and had a sandwich at the subway there in may 2001 , which seemed trivial at the time . 
  i think the stereotype that french people * generally * are chauvinistic ( a word of french origin , no less ) has some truth to it . 
  in my opinion it 's one of the reasons their english is so bad and why they can indeed be arrogant towards the states and other european countries . 
  fwiw , dutch people tend to be less nationalistic . 
  and i apologize if i caused offense . 
  right . 
  lame joke . 
  why were you so offended though ? 
  i mean , i like the netherlands and i like the states . 
  i criticize both though , exactly because i care . 
  yet in this case , i genuinely was kidding . 
  what good does linking that article in helping to prove your point exactly ? 
  yay !, 
  [ here you go !,

  me too . 
  according to astronauts , the [ overview effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overview_effect ) is quite strong . 
  heh , you are putting the finger on the sore spot !, 
  i have been sitting with that in my stomach for a time now . 
  i ca n't seem to bring over to other people that we well can change how we see these things . 
  i mean , i do n't turn my hand around for it !, 
  but i guess every little house has its little cross . 
  wow , there buddy . 
  just a joke . 
  regretfully though , one [ based in reality ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2006/education/05/02/geog.test/ ) . 
  well , surely that would never have happened , we have standards !, 
   as for dates though , i think yyyy-mm-dd ( iso 8601 ) is the most logical order . 
  scientists , computer programmers and accountants seem to agree with me . 
  the rest of the world does not . 
  [ * the * x prize ] ( http://www.xprize.org/ ) , actually . 
  duodecimal-vigesimal currency . 
  thanks , moon . 
  well , then you 're doing it wrong . 
  yup , true at least for dutch , in which it 's called ` griekenland ' . 
  and in german it 's ` griechenland ' . 
  even though it 's not correct , that is indeed the case . 
  same reason many dutch people say england ( engeland ) when they really mean great britain or even the united kingdom . 
  both are examples of * pars pro toto * . 
  i think both countries have their empires to thank for that , as those regions were the most dominant parts of the respective countries . 
  still , i prefer the netherlands though . 
  these people are what we call ... ~ ~ americans ~ ~ ignorant . 
  [ yeah ? 
  judging by the name for the united kingdom , would that translate to `` america ( n ) united states '' ? 
   if the dutch can complain about that all the time glad you noticed . 
  austria is a latinized version of the german name . 
  \u00d6sterreich also literally translates as eastern empire/realm/domain in german . 
  as it does in many languages , because austria is a latinized version of the german name ( which can be confusing , because in latin , ` auster ' means ` south ' ) . 
  he ( r ) 's --  his/her , 
  so , all of the print media are doing bad . 
  but they get subsidies . 
  does the government discriminate against right-wing media ? 
  i do n't know what papers or websites you 're talking about , but being accussed of being a neo-nazi rag sounds pretty serious . 
  what was the cause of them getting described like that ? 
  if so many left-wing papers are successfull , does n't that mean people want to read those ? 
  and what 's stopping anyone from founding a right-wing paper ? 
  not sure if unfunny joke or misread the map 's legend ... 
  it 's mainly used in the randstad conurbation . 
  sometimes people will use `` appie happie '' ( appie snacky ) . 
  ah 's app for mobile devices is called appie . 
  albert heijn , a chain of supermarkets . 
  you mean you got lesbians too now ? 
  meh , i 'm not worried . 
  we 've got the best dikes possible .

  toronto could use a gay mayor . 
  i 'm pretty sure that prussian dude , [ frederick the great ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frederick_the_great ) was gay too . 
  i mean , as long as we 're talking about historical homosexuals . 
  you mean in belgium you ca n't appeal a fine issued by municipal employees that 'd be like not being able to appeal a parking ticket from a municipal parking meter officer in the netherlands . 
  ( yes , i 've successfully contested a parking ticket . ), 
  overseas territories ? 
  nope , austria is aa + according to s&p . it 's luxemburg . 
  also in the netherlands , the entire province of flevoland is missing !, 
  your username really goes well with that comment . 
  not you . 
  okay . 
  i know , though . 
  that might be right . 
  if so , i profusely apologise to all gaelic scots speakers . 
  yes . 
  well , i meant scots to be precise .
