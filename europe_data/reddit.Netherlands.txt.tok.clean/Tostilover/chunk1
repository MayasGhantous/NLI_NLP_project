no that is not what he is saying . 
  the growth was in 2014 and syriza gained power in january of this year . 
  like others have said you ca n't just group all kurds together . 
  turkey is targetting the pkk , which is considered a terrorist organisation by both the us and the eu . 
  so is he pissed at her being female or because she does n't want to join his harem ? 
  or as a map showing where millions of people live very closely together . 
  [ the government was against it . 
  ] ( http://www.npo.nl/slag-om-europa/08-08-2014/vpwon_1220454 ) it begins at 9:40 . 
  there was a case last year with an albanian murderer granted asylum . 
  if he was sent back he was apparently in danger of getting killed in a revenge killing . 
  [ article in dutch ] ( http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/nederland/article/detail/3797914/2014/11/25/uitlevering-albanese-moordenaar-verboden.dhtml ) still , i doubt there are that many on the run for their lives . 
  they got restrictions on the size of their military . 
  and do you think that germany would just try to conquer the continent again ? 
  germany in 1989 was a different country than in 1919 or 1939 . 
  and the greatest threat to europe in the past 150 years was and remains imperialistic dick waving . 
  something many countries were guilty of . 
  or you could just let them reunify without forcing a shitty currency on them . 
  and like i said earlier greece had chances they did n't have . 
   yes , the others were known as the german axis . 
  so you are one of those people ? 
  we are n't germany 's little bitch . 
  sending more money to greece is unpopular in a lot of countries and not just germany . 
   what was the compromise deal ? 
  the one that greece offered ? 
  that is n't mentioned in the article so how should i know ? 
  you said  only 3 states support the deal when you talked about `` the deal '' i assume you meant the deal that greece got in the end . 
   the rest supported the german hardline position . 
  that is what i meant . 
  the other countries supported ** the deal ** , as in the deal that they now have . 
  besides it 's not only germany that follows a hard line . 
   only 3 states support the deal , no , those three countries supported a compromise deal . 
  read the article . 
  but greece did n't suffer 45 years of soviet occupation . 
  a lot of countries in europe are either dealing with a shrinking/aging population or will likely be dealing with one in the future . 
  do you want us to keep paying for their inflated living standards ? 
  i do n't see how them being independent for only 25 years is relevant to this discussion . 
  greece has been independent and in the eu far longer then they are . 
  meaning they had more time to get there stuff in order . 
  those countries are indeed great success stories . 
  greece could do well by learning lessons from them, 
   i 'll give you slovakia , but where are you getting estonia from ? 
  i have not heard a single thing from their camp that would be nearly as harsh as germany 's stance . 
  it 's not just about what is being said in the open but also about what happens behind closed doors . 
  and i remember it mentioned in a couple of articles . 
   and also , germany is the member state that floated all those crazy-ass proposals , why should the slovaks be getting the heat for it i do n't think anyone should be getting any heat for it . 
  this shit flinging about `` german nazis demanding a surrender '' or `` lazy workshy greeks '' needs to stop and i do n't care who started it or who did it more . 
  apparently his predecessor jan kees de jager was also hated in greece . 
  of all eu countries germany is probably the easiest to demonize . 
  i am sure they could also say nasty things about slovakians or estonians ( who are reportedly greece 's harshest creditors ) , but they are still poorer than the greeks . 
  so it 's easier to delude oneself by saying that the germans are nazis trying to dominate europe once again . 
  yes it is all one big conspiracy is n't it ? 
  [ here is another fun one . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bj64j/greeces_troubles_attract_little_sympathy_from/ ), 
  how about , thanks for the beer . 
  the fact that they are from two different language families probably does n't help either . 
  we have that here to . 
  that does not explain why belgium is more than two times as high as us . 
  from what i understand you need to speak both dutch and french if you want to succeed on the belgian labor market . 
  many immigrants already have trouble learning 1 new language , imagine having to learn 2 . 
  and may the schwartz be with you . 
  not so great for the people who have to live through it though . 
  was n't it amsterdam ? 
  i remember eberhard van der laan ( mayor of amsterdam ) talk about deporting her . 
  [ you are far from the first to notice the similarities . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/vrw2bp-quwg?t=32s ), 
  they do n't `` send '' them north , they just let them go . 
  they do that because the rest of the eu barely does anything to help them out . 
  i do n't agree with what they are doing , but i do n't blame them for getting desperate and start thinking `` fuck it '' . 
  [ yeah about that . 
  ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/lijst_van_heuvels_in_nederland ) for any foreigners `` berg '' is the dutch word for mountain . 
  i believe she moved away after mh-17 got shot down . 
  you should be glad you were n't lynched . 
   the biggest detriment for greece at the moment is the freedom of movement within the eu . 
  there is no ( economic ) reason for talented people to stay in the country . 
  actually i would say that is a big advantage . 
  if they did n't have that people would be trapped in greece . 
  now the greeks still have a way out . 
  and not just for talented people mind you . 
   he is currently trying to turn greece off and on again . 
  nice one . 
  [ this article ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bj64j/greeces_troubles_attract_little_sympathy_from/ ) is about how bulgarians view the events currently going on in greece . 
  it seems like sentiments in romania are similar . 
  i hope those bastards get caught and that people living there do n't rely on tourists for their income . 
  otherwise they might be in for some tough times . 
  i agree that elections , and the greek one in particular , are often just choosing between varying degrees of shit . 
  however he did n't do or say a many things that instilled trust . 
  also i do n't see why the troika should have made allowances for inexperience . 
  he had five months to adjust to the reality of international politics . 
  i do n't know exactly how high the greek debt currently is or how much it has grown since syriza came to power . 
  but i was referring to the the referendum and the whole mess surrounding it . 
   it has been 5 years and the rhetoric is keep going . 
  it has been 5 years and things arguably have n't been this dire since this whole mess began . 
  it was something . 
  a more experienced and trustworthy government could have used it to secure a better deal from the troika . 
  not right now obviously . 
  but 30 , 20 or perhaps even as soon as 10 years from now people wo n't be as swept up in the populist rhetoric being spouted by both sides . 
  and they will have moved on to other things to worry or get angry about . 
  i edited my comment . 
  my excuses for this . 
  thanks .
