comments from the guardian from people who do n't understand metaphors :  francis . 
  please . 
   you might have a point to make but your language clearly indicates your bias against women . 
  god has no such bias . 
   i think frank knows exactly what that phrase is intended to do . 
  would he have referred to america is having ' erectile dysfunction ' in its inability to deal with its problems ? 
  women , gay men and children are always easy targets for the church . 
   uuuugh he is just awful . 
  what a terrible thing to say coming from a ` barren ' man . 
   i have never subscribed to the opinion that old people should have a license to make sexist/racist/homophobic comments . 
   so he is disgusted by women who are old and/or childless . 
  in his world a woman 's only value is in being young and fertile . 
  what a vile man he is . 
  these comments are only from the first 3 pages . 
  they are quite hilarious and it 's amazing that they do n't understand that the pope speaks in metaphors . 
  hopefully , feminists understand that women carry babies and that the pope speaks in metaphors . 
  honestly , i will take your fake reality tv over this comment any day . 
  that 's a really good find . 
  i already found the statistics strange considering that the sample size was small ( i honestly would expect 2000 + for a huge city like paris ) . 
  i get really sick of people who skew statistics to make their point more favourable . 
  i feel like media warfare is only going to get worse over the years , considering that critical thinking skills is n't standard in public school cirriculum . 
  i 'm going to trust frans timmerman over you . 
  considering the politcal climate , i do n't see why he would lie . 
  they are n't nato members though . 
  i find it quite shameful that we ascociate with turkey . 
  geopoloitics is a bitch . 
  supporting oil sales from isis and using refugees as leverage in a discussion . 
  i also do n't think it 's fair that we have a nato member with appalling human rights and the control of turkish media . 
  freedom of speech only extends to those who are not `` dissidents '' . 
  do you really support that drivel after it became known that 60 % of the migrants are north african ? 
  how so ? 
  turkey should have been sanctioned long ago for their sketchy shit but the geopolitical situation gives the turkish so much leverage . 
  go express your opinion of erdogan in public and see how long it takes before you are thrown in jail for having an opinion . 
  having an outer border would have been a decent start . 
  giving man power and other resources to the greeks , hungarians and austrians a few months ago would have also been great . 
  instead we get strong words from merkel that protecting your sovereingnty from unidentified migrants is bad . 
  2 years in a row you had gangs of immigrant men groping and assaulting young girls at an event . 
  we only found out about it recently because fuck the people if it means that sd might gain a bit more popularity . 
  so far , nothing `` will work out in the end '' based on how swedish people approach problem solving . 
  deluded, 
  that is very true . 
  most euros ca n't handle spicy food or heavily spiced food so you ger bastardized mexican food . 
  i 've been to a few thai places and the waiters look at me like i am retarded when i ask for one the spiciest dishes . 
  i 've been to the us . 
  the portion sizes are disgusting , the chocolate ( hershey 's and us m&m 's ) is disgusting and it 's not uncommon that you 'll see 20 + fast food joints if you travel down the road for a mile ( in florida ) . 
  one of the biggest sins of ameicans is their appalling mayonaise and cheese . 
  i 've heard of that but then with ice cream . 
  there is vitually no milk/cream in a lot of american ice cream brands that they are not allowed to call it such . 
  america is such a weird and disgusting country . 
  canned cheese is utterly disgusting . 
  decent brands over here make decent melting cheese . 
  it actually is mostly made of cheese ( at least over here it is ) and it 's a guilty pleasure of mine . 
  sick correlation . 
  you 're right , considering that americans bathe their chickens in chlorine . 
  you never want to be behind america in food standards . 
  most certainly not . 
  go to london and count how many houses/apartments are owned by russians . 
  then you have to keep in mind that there are still a lot of other people from countries that are investing in british property which they almost ** never use ** . 
  why are you trying to be edgy ? 
  this happened in the uk and ** twelve ** men conspired to rape a thirteen year old girl . 
  it 's not really a coincidence that reported gang rapes seem to involve a lot more people with immigrant backgrounds than european natives . 
  i am against gentrification . 
  housing in areas like berlin and london is scarce . 
  the last thing you need are foreign millionaires/billionaires buying out all of the property and inflating the value to the point that no common person that needs it can afford it . 
  the political statement show with lots of bribery . 
  was there a point when eurovision was about having talented singers competing ? 
  i am pretty sure that a lot of rape goes unreported in countries with terrible women 's rights . 
  do n't fortet genital mutilation which those cultures can add to their list . 
  honour killings if your daughter got raped or force them to marry their rapist . 
  if we take your statistics on the likelihood of getting molested by family members , how fucking bad do you think it is in countries like pakistan ? 
  where you can force your 10 year old daughter to be married to some sick fuck for the sake of creating ties or money . 
  i find it absolutely ridiculous that you think that rape is just as likely here as a country in north africa , pakistan or afghanistan . 
  i also want to add that men in north african countries and middle east have a completely different understanding with sexuality . 
  they have some really backwards thoughts on human sexuality and it is reflected in islamic law and portrayal of women in the quran . 
  can you name the last time that a 1000 european civillian men conspired together to rob and sexually harras women in public ? 
  i do n't think that has ever happened in recent history . 
  it 's more surprising that a dude with an adam 's apple , deep voice and stubbles can pass as a kid . 
  it was quite hilarious when a finnish official was meeting with children . 
  one kid he met up with was actually a 25 year old boxer . 
  no clue how you can pass as a kid so easily . 
  sweden it was ~ 45 % committed by immigrants before they stopped recording ethnicities of perpetrators ( before their foreign born population exploded ) . 
  in norway it was around 40 % with the minority of immigrants being quite a small number . 
  austria ( i think it was listed in the article about the boy ) have about 40 % committed by them as well . 
  you can look for statistics yourself as well . 
  it 's not really a coincidence that men who come from countries where women have a worse social status than my dog would commit such crimes . 
  read some verses from the quran as well if you want some more incite on how we are terrible scum destined to burn in hell for not following islam . 
  not all of us . 
  north africans and egyptians are taught that women who wear `` revealing '' clothes are asking for it . 
  i am a eurosceptic . 
  there 's nothing wrong with being one either because the eu is a joke . 
  there is no unity , it functions like one of the worst bureaucracies i have ever seen , powerful nations pull the strings and others expect to follow . 
  the handling of the potential grexit was attrocious at best , i am absolutely furious that germany comprimised the safety of every eu nation and expects us to foot the bill for ego-philanthropy trip . 
  there is no such thing as a free market either in eu so at this point , i 'm not sure why we even have an eu . 
  the only things i can remember about being in the eu ( besides the other awesome countries in eu ) is having to pay more tax for other countries ' blunder . 
  the most positive thing i can remember at best are improved human rights standards but the netherlands has their own laws which are better and more advanced . 
  pretty sure that 600 thousand single male north africans is a bigger issue than radical parties gaining support . 
  in many eu nations , almost half of the rapes are caused by small immigrant minorities ( spoiler alert : many of them come from somalia or islamic countries ) . 
  stop making a political shift so melodramatic . 
  it still boggles my mind that you value uneducated , potentially illiterate and mysoginistic foreigners over your own people . 
  i thought every head of state swears an oath to serve the country .
