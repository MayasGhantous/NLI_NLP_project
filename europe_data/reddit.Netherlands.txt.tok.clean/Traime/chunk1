yup , i recognized brian roy first , 
   my deepest sympathies with the dutch , and other nations affected . 
  thank you , words like that soothe the pain and grief a bit . 
  [ security council coalesces around resolution 2166 ( 2014 ) on malaysian jet crash - demanding accountability , full access to site , halt to military activities ] ( http://www.un.org/news/press/docs/2014/sc11483.doc.htm ) [ resolution on #mh 17 as adopted unanimously at today 's un security council ] ( http://t.co/k6du43l1k1 ) [ un security council resolution ` an excellent achievement ' ] ( http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/un-security-council-resolution-an-excellent-achievement/story-fn59nm2j-1226997154403 ), 
   `` since thursday , i 've been thinking how horrible it must have been , the final moments of their lives , when they know the plane was going down , '' dutch foreign minister frans timmermans told a u.n. security council meeting on monday . 
   `` did they lock hands with their loved ones ? 
  did they hold their children close to their hearts ? 
  did they look each other in the eyes one final time in a wordless goodbye ? 
  we will never know . '', 
   a disgusting touch in a completely fictitious construction . 
  carlos ? 
  is that you ? 
  that jon stewart excuse is getting boring . 
   saying that installing cctv in a university hallway is `` way worse '' than the stasi is ott . 
  nope . 
   also , `` misleading , historically ignorant , intellectually lazy and deliberately cavilous '' . 
  buy a parrot . 
  what ? 
  the mere fact that you talk about something does n't make what you say any more or less valid . 
   installing cctv in a publicly accessible space to prevent crime is quite literally nothing like secret police spies . 
  actually , yes it is . 
  it 's way worse . 
  the growing web of surveillance of public space and private communication would have been like a wet dream for the stasi , according to several former stasi agents . 
  for you to pretend that camera surveillance happens in isolation , then seeding opinion on these occurrences by declaring beforehand that such camera surveillance is there to `` prevent crime '' , when such devices are nearly always used beyond their original mandate is misleading , historically ignorant , intellectually lazy and deliberately cavilous . 
  privacy is a human right . 
  it does n't matter why you think surveillance is a good thing . 
  yet , if i buy a bicycle from another person offering it on marktplaats and do n't ask for a receipt , that 's perfectly legal . 
  so , i 'm just asking , which greek law on the books are tourists violating and how long will they go to jail for a violation of said law ? 
  so , i take it that tourists are , under penalty of law , *** forced *** to ask for and receive a receipt before they pay ? 
  how long could you go to jail for failing to demand a receipt in greece or forgetting about it ? 
  years ? 
  all because of a possible crime the person i 'm demanding the receipt from * might * commit later ? 
  does n't sound like a country i 'd want to visit . 
   well a few points on that , first canada 's spending is equivalent to or even slightly more than germany 's . 
  canada 's defense spending is 1 % of gdp . 
  1 % below the nato norm . 
  germany spends 1.1 % , 0.9 % below the nato norm . 
  france spends 2.2 % , which is 0.2 % above the norm , the u.k spends 2.1 % and poland spends 1.9 % . 
  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs  the united states has never expended billions of dollars maintaining canadian sovereignty which is not the case for germany . 
  germany pays hundreds of millions of euros to the americans for their bases . 
  http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/geheimer-krieg-deutschland-zahlt-millionen-fuer-us-militaer-1.1820318 you get the one-sided story in the american media but in reality , germany and japan pay to be occupied . 
  the united states drone program is run from there , rammstein is a crucial waypoint for american soldiers deploying to the middle east and central asia . 
  it 's absolutely essential for american military power projection . 
  it 's a prized asset , and anything but `` just there to protect germany '' . 
  not only that , there are many american spy bases in germany which the u.s. uses to . . you guessed it . . spy on the germans and the rest of mainland europe , often for economic and political gain , as we 've learned . 
  what a fantastic deal , right ? 
   the united states has never expended billions of dollars maintaining canadian sovereignty have you ever heard of norad ? 
  i 'm sure you have . 
  in this article from 1998 , fas hosts an article complaining about canada 's share in paying for norad . 
  http://fas.org/news/canada/0039.htm more complaining about canadian defense spending : http://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2014/03/canadas-defence-spending  canada has also long won anerican favor because quite frankly they 've always behaved like our closest friends and supported us deeply . 
  who would have thought ? 
   it may have been sevens decades ago but americans remember that canada was with us at d-day and the germans were shooting at us . 
  you do remember that europe consists of 50 nations and that 48 of them are not germany or italy , right ? 
   that matters , national memory is a relatively slow moving thing . 
  oh come off it . 
  about 80 million americans are of ( distant or not ) german descent and they like to make a point of that . 
  a million germans live in the united states . 
  2 million german tourists visit each year . 
  you run your drone and surveillance operation from germany . 
  you do lots of trade with germany . 
  you 're quite happy to have germany host your soldiers and do your bidding , but when it comes to defense spending , suddenly the old war sores come back to bite you . 
  and what 's more , you 'll pick germany or italy because you do n't have that `` shooting at us '' nonsense to go by otherwise , because we , the civil population were occupied , tortured and executed by the germans , something you were n't and never had to live through except for a few incidents with u.s. soldiers executed by germans . 
  we were * directly adjacent * to germany and suffered the * full force * of the nazis . 
  do you see us whining about that now ? 
  what a weak , weak attempt to deflect . 
  we do n't have any of that mistrust for germany you claim to have . 
  it 's 70 years ago . 
  besides , you outsourced most of the anti-germany wwii effort to the russians , anyway . 
   this contrasts the situation in europe which has frequently required expensive us interventions . 
  they were pretty expensive for europe the first two times ... did you notice that or did you think we were having a blast ? 
  what * really * drew you into wwii anyway ? 
  japan . 
  and yugoslavia ... that makes three . 
  what else ? 
  something else , btw . 
  did you know that france went into crippling debt when it went to war for you against the british in your war of independence ? 
  it is because of france ' help to the united states in its revolutionary war against the british that the french went effectively bankrupt and the french revolution happened . 
  and they still gave you a statue out of respect for your ideals . 
  your thanks ? 
  call the french cowards when they do n't join you in the iraq war , the casus belli for which you wholly contrived . 
  and now we 've got isis , whose rise was precipitated by the iraq war and thus caused by the united states , [ according to president barack obama himself ] ( http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/03/16/obama_isis_unintended_consequence_of_invading_iraq_which_is_why_we_should_aim_before_we_shoot.html ) . 
  thanks eh ? 
  when you 're `` handling ukraine '' , it 's [ `` fuck the eu '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl_gshygv3o ) , remember ? 
  you 're really worried about us , are n't you ? 
   that being said do n't pretend like all american decisions are purely evil and pragmatic . 
  i do n't . 
  yugoslavia is an example . 
  the marshall plan was a pretty good example . 
  but i seized on your canada comment because it shows just how * hypocritical * and * selective * the `` we are financing your welfare states through our defense spending '' - propaganda is . 
   americans do n't profit more from our geopolitical profile any more than germany , or many other countries . 
  yeah , no , i 'm not buying it . 
   canada has taken a harder line against russian aggression than germany has . 
  i 'm so glad you brought that up . 
  and what , pray tell , is canada 's defense spending as a % of gdp and why are n't you whining about * that * ? 
  the answer to that question reveals the selectivity of american outrage and exposes what the argument is really about : domestic propaganda to justify astronomical defense spending , to make excuses for the lack of a social safety net akin to `` socialist '' european countries , and to put europe into a state of perpetual moral indebtedness ( `` we are protecting you '' ) ... while americans profit massively in terms of geopolitics from their worldwide omnipresence ... while playing the victim `` ooh ... look at us ... we have to work so hard to protect you '' . 
   i 'm going to have to shoot your messenger here : i like your style , welshman . 
  we probably disagree about a fair number of things on this issue and its periphery , but i must say your comment history is impressive . 
  l. ron hubbard ? 
   i 'm seriously expecting geert wilders to be targeted by terrorists now so , absolutely nothing will change from last week , essentially . 
  that sounds almost like a cult,
