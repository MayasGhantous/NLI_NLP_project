  ** response , premi\u00e8re partie : **  if logic were your ` forte ' and it is . 
   you 'd understand the use of ` necessary and sufficient ' . 
  of course . 
  the link you cite is a long-winded exposition of the ambiguities in establishing cause-and-effect relationships introduced by the subtleties of linguistics as well as what amounts to an explanation of the concepts of non causa pro causa and affirming the consequent . 
  i would n't know about these things unless i had intimate prior knowledge of the subject matter . 
  i doubt you even read the article yourself . 
  you may have just googled `` necessary and sufficient '' and picked out the first link . 
  as you well know , lifting the words `` necessary and sufficient '' , which by themselves are perfectly clear concepts , from a sentence which in its entirety amounts to barely comprehensible rubbish , and then holding them out and saying `` look at you !, 
  you do n't understand these two words ! '', 
  is of course a rather desperate cop out . 
  in fact , one could even say you 're committing the fallacy of composition here , since you pretend that the whole necessarily carries the same properties of clarity of two of its components . 
  it does not . 
  to put it more prosaically : what in the everliving fuck is `` reconciling a cause-mean relationship in the ad-hoc sense '' supposed to be other than pretentious and vacuous babble ? 
  i 'm sure you can slowly and tediously pick that apart , taking each element out and then carefully put it back together , arriving at what was your original sentence , plucked of all the cloudy jibber-jabber :  they have both the means and motivation ; furthermore their supposed intent and action is both sufficient and necessary to achieve their stated goals . 
  apart from grammatical error , i suppose you mean : the effect observed , which is the news that three french presidents have been spied on , can be tied to the nsa as a cause . 
  however , using both ** necessary ** and sufficient as qualifiers , we arrive at this abomination : `` if and only if three french presidents were spied on , the nsa did the spying '' or : `` if and only if nsa did the spying , three french presidents were spied on '' that is a blanket , logically extremely stringent * deduction * ( and a fallacy of affirming the consequent ) which you claim to be able to make without looking at the documents leaked . 
  you state this as if it were a truism . 
  i conclude from that the following : * you do n't know what the hell you 're talking about * . 
  or perhaps , you meant to say : `` the nsa means to spy on the world '' , then yes , what a way to state the blindingly obvious couched in the most incredible bloviation , what an utterly useless contribution to the discussion and most of all : what an incredible waste of time puffing up your `` creds '' over something so self-evident . 
  obfuscation of the obvious is a craft you 've mastered , i 'll give you that . 
  then , *** amazingly *** , you proceed to call into question , on a mendacious basis , the various actual inductive , reality-based and documented * grounds * which * actually establish these facts to be true * . 
  so , what you are actually doing here , is saying you would believe your own fallacious deductive claims or otherwise , completely self-evident no-brainer , while at the same time throwing suspicion and doubt , based on lies and distortions , on the actual evidence supporting this particular claim . 
  breathtaking . 
  i 'm impressed . 
  by the way , i noticed the author of the article you linked makes a fallacy of affirming the consequent too , when he asserts that when the door is open , it necessarily follows that it was opened with a key . 
  he then qualifies his statement with `` without violence '' later , attempting to repair his mistake . 
  odd , but nevertheless fitting , considering the subject matter he 's tackling . 
   unknowable veracity : we ca n't neither independently verify the veracity of the leaked documents this is akin to [ epistemological solipsism ] ( http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_solipsism.html )  epistemological solipsism is a type of idealism according to which only the directly accessible mental contents of an individual can be known . 
  the existence of an external world is regarded as an unresolvable question or an unnecessary hypothesis , rather than actually false . 
  the same standard applies to the snowden leaks : we can not ever know with 100 % certainty that the leaks are genuine . 
  we can not know with 100 % certainty if most news reports are genuine . 
  we can not know with 100 % certainty that if we watch the white house on television that it actually exists , because is was related to us via a communication medium , and as such it is an indirect , not a direct , experience . 
  we could visit the white house and see for ourselves , but we must rely on indirect evidence otherwise . 
   there are two basic types of objective facts , things and events . 
  a `` thing '' is an actually existing entity , animal , vegetable , or mineral . 
  the white house is an example of the first type of fact , and the assassination of abraham lincoln of the second . 
  the first type is more basic than the second because events are made up of things or of the actions of things . 
  a state dinner is to be held at the white house . 
  such an event could not take place were it not for the existence , first and foremost , of the fact that is the white house , and countless other facts as well . 
  in order to establish the factualness of an event , any number of concrete things need to be appealed to . 
   to determine the reality of a fact that is a thing , all you need to do is pay a visit . 
  if it actually exists it must be somewhere , and , assuming its place to be accessible to you , you can verify its factualness by direct observation . 
  take the case of the white house . 
  to ascertain its being a fact , rather than purely imaginary , you can travel to washington d.c. and there see the white house with your own eyes . 
  that is the most direct and reliable way to establish its factualness . 
  but you could also rely on indirect evidence : for example , by taking the word of a trustworthy eyewitness that the white house is indeed in washington , d.c. or you could decide that photographic evidence is sufficient to establish factualness . 
   but what about an event like lincoln 's assassination ? 
  we say that is a fact . 
  what is the justification for that claim ? 
  it is an event that is over and done with , and there are no living witnesses to the event whom we might consult . 
  obviously , we did not ourselves witness the event , so direct evidence is out of the question . 
  in this case our approach will be to acquaint ourselves with a variety of things that serve as indirect evidence of the event . 
  for example , we would consult official documents ( police reports , the death certificate , etc. 
  ) , newspaper accounts , photographs , memoirs , diaries , and items in the congressional record , all of which are facts in their own right and whose only reasonable explanation is the factualness of lincoln 's assassination . 
  on the basis of the factualness of these things , we establish the factualness of the event . 
  and thus we establish a historical fact .

  mcinerny - being logical : a guide to good thinking ] so what was it , / u/live _ free , that compelled you to make your statements about the nsa , if other than reporting which you accepted as fact , without the same kind of slippery `` unknowability '' that you assign to this report ? 
  nothing , of course , because you are * selectively applying philosophical concepts about the very nature of reality to further your agenda * , are n't you , / u/live _ free ? 
  ** response , deuxi\u00e8me partie : ** so what did wikileaks do ? 
   today , 23 june 2015 , wikileaks began publishing `` espionnage \u00c9lys\u00e9e '' , a collection of top secret intelligence reports and technical documents from the us national security agency ( nsa ) concerning targeting and signals intelligence intercepts of the communications of high-level officials from successive french governments over the last ten years . 
   the top secret documents derive from directly targeted nsa surveillance of the communications of french presidents francois hollande ( 2012 -- present ) , nicolas sarkozy ( 2007 -- 2012 ) , and jacques chirac ( 1995 -- 2007 ) , as well as french cabinet ministers and the french ambassador to the united states . 
  ** the documents also contain the `` selectors '' from the target list , detailing the cell phone numbers of numerous officials in the elysee up to and including the direct cell phone of the president . 
  **  prominent within the top secret cache of documents are intelligence summaries of ** conversations between french government officials concerning some of the most pressing issues facing france and the international community ** ( ... )  we are proud of our work with ** leading french publishers liberation and mediapart ** to bring this story to light . 
  french readers can expect more timely and important revelations in the near future . '', 
  https://wikileaks.org/nsa-france/ one such document : http://static.mediapart.fr/files/imagecache/770_pixels/media_171673/hollande.png hollande made a statement , [ even convened an emergency meeting of the defense council ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/23/francois-hollande-emergency-meeting-wikileaks-us-spied-three-presidents-france ) . 
  sarkozy made a statement , sarkozy 's chief of staff made a statement , france [ summoned the american ambassador ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/24/europe/france-wikileaks-nsa-spying-claims/ ) , and every single one of them is in a position to know if the intercepts published in fact describe what they were discussing at the time they were speaking to each other . 
  in fact , the leaks even contain a report about the french *** complaining to the americans that they would n't stop spying on them *** . 
  obama promised hollande that spying on the french had been `` discontinued '' :  u.s. surveillance practices , in particular those targeting foreign leaders such as german chancellor merkel , have come under scrutiny in recent years . 
  many speculated that the u.s. also targeted french leaders , so yesterday 's revelations are more of a confirmation of these suspicions than a complete surprise . 
  it does not make them more acceptable from a political standpoint , even if the activities in question are understood to have been discontinued . 
  ** president obama committed to put an end to such practices , and reiterated this commitment in february 2014 during president hollande 's state visit to the united states and again today during a phone conversation between both leaders . 
  ** http://csis.org/publication/spying-les-les-presidents-impact-us-french-relationship  u.s. president barack obama reaffirmed in a phone call with his french counterpart francois hollande on wednesday washington 's commitment to end spying practices deemed `` unacceptable '' by its allies . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/24/us-france-wikileaks-iduskbn0p32em20150624 you can not `` end '' something that has never begun . 
  wikileaks has vetted its sources and has been vindicated in every which way . 
  thus , your description about the veracity of the documents as `` unknowable '' is an outright lie . 
   to denote using the word as a word , rather than to connote a specific meaning ... bla bla bla could you possibly be any less forthright ? 
  any less obfuscatory and deceptive even when you 're attempting to walk back your initial deceptive claims ? 
  this is anything but a `` rebuttal '' . 
  it 's a non-apology apology . 
   automatically accepting as fact : speaking with regards to the laymen ... ( ... ) your arrogance blinds you . 
  as i 've just demonstrated , i have n't `` automatically accepted anything ''  you 're argument is logically fallacious ( fallacy of the excluded middle ) wrong . 
  i called into question your selective application of your vaunted `` principles '' , which , given the track record on nsa leaks , is in addition wholly unwarranted . 
  the essence of concern trolling is repeated concession ( `` look at me , i 'm one of you '' ) as a matter of preemptive rhetorical disarming . 
  this ingratiation process then lubricates the recipients for the ensuing falsehoods : much more palatable , coming from `` one of us '' , is n't it ? 
   that 's nothing short of a moderate measured statement . 
  preceded by :  stop trying to champion something you know fuck all about you 're only * masquerading * as `` moderate '' , that much is clear . 
  and you have * no idea * who you 're talking to and what i know . 
  but that little outburst you had there ? 
  it shows how much you 're itching to demonstrate your entanglement with the very apparatus you 're pretending to critique . 
   i 've already explained this point numerous times , i 'm beginning to believe the manner in which i broached the topic went over your head . 
  unlikely . 
  logic is my forte . 
  that brings us to this somewhat pretentious bit :  in reconciling a cause-mean relationship in the ad-hoc sense the specific cause must be both necessary and sufficient . 
  if something sounds completely nonsensical and pretentious , especially when relating to a subject one is intimately familiar with , one can call that what it is : nonsensical and pretentious . 
   i do n't get where you 're reading into my statement that i suggested wikileaks -- et al. 
  -- to be untrustworthy . 
  i get that from here :  does anyone else feel uneasy about automatically accepting as fact `` top secret intelligence reports and technical documents '' randomly ` dropped ' of unknowable veracity ? 
   i 'm certainly against the nsa 's spying largesse , but at this point almost anyone could ` leak ' anything , claiming anything , pin it on the nsa , fit the ` archetype ' , and it seems no one would ever question it . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3avbjw/leaked_documents_reveal_the_extent_of_nsa_spying/csgeuwj the qualifier `` unknowable veracity '' is an outright lie , `` randomly dropped '' is a mischaracterization , `` automatically accepting as fact '' is an exaggeration and the entire sentence completely belittles the wikileaks source document vetting process .
