  the question is n't whether or not your assessment of this leak itself and by extension the wikileaks process is correct ; it is n't . 
  the question is why you are concern trolling . 
  the question is why you 're not addressing these documents ' vindication , *** yet again *** . 
  the question is why you choose , of all things , *** to question the credibility of adversarial journalism *** , after decades of criminal actions and full-scale information warfare by the american government , sometimes with mainstream print and visual media complicity . 
   which again , i had previously refrained -- and you 've failed to address . 
  i 've addressed it . 
   you 've proven nothing other than you have far too much time on your hands to creep through the history of some random reddit account . 
  oh , i do n't have to do any of this by hand . 
  i 'm interested in this phenomenon of subtle and not-so-subtle manipulation of opinion on things like the nsa , wikileaks , edward snowden , glenn greenwald , etc. 
  etc. , and automated analysis greatly improves the ability to map this out . 
  meanwhile , the documents leaked by wikileaks contain the most detailed and sensitive information , including mobile phone numbers of the french president and other members of the elys\u00e9e . 
  the french media has scrutinized the documents and the french have summoned the american ambassador . 
  in other words , it turns out that nsa reporting was dead on accurate *** yet again *** , and the nsa apologists were either wrong or lying *** yet again *** . 
  yes , you did `` suggest '' very carefully that we should distrust nsa reporting . 
  it allows for accusations without accountability . 
  i know the game . 
   furthermore i 'm not now -- nor was i ever -- an american soldier . 
  take off the tinfoil hat . 
  yet you hang around in places like / r/navy , / r/combatfootage , all these military-related subreddits . 
  you see , this is n't the first time things like this happen . 
  you can trot out the worn-down `` tin-foil hat '' reproach but i do n't really see how that can ever apply to random people on reddit with multiple accounts and certain convictions , exposure of which they fear might alienate them from their peers in europe , for example . 
  unless you wish to claim that being wise to sockpuppetry is `` paranoid '' . 
   that 's just one example of the myriad of potential examples of modern journalism failing . 
  i would say that particular `` journalism '' achieved what it was intended to achieve , so it could be considered a `` success '' from that perspective . 
  the real journalism , the type that speaks truth to power while also abiding by the journalistic method , that journalism is doing just fine . 
  equating establishment mouthpieces putting out deceptive talking points leading to an illegal war with the publication of documented sources by an organization going against the grain at the expense of their own liberty and safety is disingenuous . 
  so , frankly , i think you may have an axe to grind . 
  you 're very well versed in all matters europe and economics , but you 're a proud american yourself , with what seems like a history serving in the military/navy . 
  i can imagine a few reasons why you 'd not like wikileaks and would want to cast aspersions on them . 
  actually , your profile looks almost like that of a american diplomat . 
   at this point it would be more interesting/surprising who was not spied upon . 
  david cameron . 
  does n't that tell you something ? 
  sound like they should considra the consequences, 
  no , my link is frisian , afrikaans is what you linked  i have almost no trouble understanding that btw . . 
  but that 's theron , it 's going to be a lot more difficult if i tried deciphering everything die antwoord says . 
  the smartshop bit was a lot of cringe ... 
  i can picture the type in my mind 's eye : a young childless hipster couple from amsterdam working for an advertisement bureau ... super-entitled and all-knowing , want to do mushrooms to explore their spirituality ;p btw louis van gaal is a huge portugal fan , he calls it `` his little paradise '' :p, 
   darn , is it intelligible to you guys ? 
  i immediately recognize the segment and can visualize the reporter 's face , even ;-) they 're talking about a renovation of a theater , and the relocation of leeuwarden ( the capital ) library . 
  and somebody who was arrested for not cooperating with the rescue of three cows which were stranded in a canal . 
  ( or that he hit his neighbour for not cooperating ) ( life is exciting ;p ) edit : here 's an example of a news report : http://www.omropfryslan.nl/utstjoering/hjoed-fan-22-juny-2015-1700 afrikaans is somewhat understandable , but at least , you get that it 's afrikaans , i do n't know how to explain that . 
  it 's the tone , some words , the rhythm , stuff like that . 
  the war in ukraine is off-topic in this thread ? 
  what it shows is that while signing artillery shells is inflammatory , there is an asymmetry here between russia and ukraine that ought not to be overlooked when assessing just how inflammatory one or the other is . 
  fortunately for russia , their territory is n't being annexed and usurped as we speak . 
  who knows ? 
  do you ? 
  do i ? 
  who is to know ? 
   would losing that war to russia be acceptable to you ? 
  i thought there was no russian military on ukrainian soil ? 
  but of course , when the time comes to make threats on reddit , they 're there and we should all be very afraid . 
  in other news / u/piddlydiddly got banned on / r/aww for saying `` fuck you '' and other dastardly personal attacks . 
  if my neighbours dropped a shell on my balcony i 'd be dropping it right back on theirs . 
  i 'm not to be fucked with . 
  i know . 
   syriza tried to get a rally going on wednesday and got ~ 10000 people out of 5 million athenians , nd tried to get a rally going on thursday and got ~ 10000 people out of 5 million athenians . 
  people just do n't care anymore . 
  i understand and acknowledge what you 're saying , but . . 10,000 ... those are dream numbers for a demonstration where i 'm from . . 
  since their brains are n't even `` close '' to fully developed , i 'm sure they are n't even `` close '' to being able to experience unbearable suffering .

   malaysian prime minister najib razak 's step-grandmother was on board downed flight mh17 . 
   siti amirah , 83 , was one of 44 malaysians who were killed . 
   najib said in a tweet : `` i personally share the grief of the families on board #mh 17 . '', 
   `` my step-grandmother was one of the passengers . '',

  the united states defense budget is for the united states , primarily . 
  but , if we were to add up france ( 66 million people ) , germany ( 80 million people ) , italy ( 60 million people ) and the uk ( 64 million people ) , with a combined population of about 270 million people , we get about $ 183.1 billion in defense spending for those four vs. $ 581 billion for the united states , which has 320 million inhabitants . 
  russia and china together spend about $ 200 billion . 
  if the united states spent $ 381 billion less , we 'd still be spending about double what those two are spending . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures e.u. 
  countries could and should be spending more , but the u.s. defense budget is astronomical , so contrasting indirect nato contributions on the basis of national defense budgets is always going to make the united states look like sugar daddy . 
  every time you ask whether the e.u. 
  spends enough , i can likewise ask , given the population sizes , whether the u.s. is n't spending way too much . 
  and i 've only included four e.u. 
  countries : there are 50 countries in total , so i 'm being very conservative here . 
  i 've left out poland , for example , widely recognized as a big spender . 
  spain , finland , the netherlands , etc. 
  `` yeah but you need force projection '' yes , but do we need to spend ( at least , because the number should be bigger ) $ 560 billion more than russia and china taken together ? 
  at what point is this more about mic profits , $ 100 hammers , $ 50 nails and $ 500 toilet seats ? 
  go ahead and do the usual whinefest about how e.u. 
  are subsidizing `` welfare states '' ( where ? 
  i thought we were `` europoors '' and p.i.g.s. 
  -- how can we be both at the same time ? 
  do you think being jobless is fun ? ), 
  ... but as soon as you know these facts as i do , you know it 's overblown . 
  should the e.u. 
  spend more ? 
  yes . 
  are we parasites ? 
  no , the united states has an * astronomical defense budget skewing everything * . 
  or maybe we 're cowards . 
  that 's also possible . 
  those are * indirect * costs , based on a comparison of national defense budgets . 
  therefore , this percentage is no surprise , considering u.s. defense spending is astronomical . 
  to say that the u.s. contributes 73 % of the nato *** budget *** is false .
