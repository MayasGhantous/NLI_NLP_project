  it 's about 22 % . 
  kut means cunt in dutch ... 
  but we use the word informally and we often use it in jest . 
  it 's not as harsh in dutch as it is in english . 
  patronizing . 
  the victim , lucas boom aka ` puk ' http://vlinderscrime.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/puk.jpg the act : http://static-webregio.nl/content/images/large/13511531_635694539188980748.jpg, 
  fuck that . 
  i 'll come to poland on my own accord and enlist if nato abandons poland . 
  no way is that happening again if i can help it , however insignificant my contribution . 
  if europeans ca n't see how defending poland is defending all of us , they 're blind . 
   thanks god the usa exists . 
  uhmm ... and the rest of europe 's nato members , thank you . 
  happy portugal day then  got ta remember the date . . 
  anybody want to post sites for learning portuguese , please go ahead . . english - portuguese is fine . 
  in the netherlands you 're supposed to lick the person 's cheek from chin to ear while whispering below your voice how much you 'd like some fava beans with a nice chianti on the side . 
  especially when you 're meeting your in-laws for the first time . 
  add a grunting/slithering sound for full effect . 
  `` you 're a reasonably okay ally too , united states '', 
  i 'm going to keep track of these series . . 
  thank you !, 
  hmmm , good question . 
  few people want to learn our language , so i do n't know anything off the top ... let me look . . maybe this is a start ? 
  http://neerlandes.org/pt-pt/node/263 http://neerlandes.org/pt-pt/neerlandes_na_web this is a combined resource for spanish and portuguese people , it seems , sorry about that . . at least the page is in portuguese , and has links to sites offering online courses . 
  pronunciation : http://www.heardutchhere.net/dutchpronunciation.html basics and pronunciation : http://www.omniglot.com/writing/dutch.htm alphabet and pronunciation : http://www.learndutch.org/dutch-alphabet-pronunciation/ you 're going to have major difficulties with pronunciation ( of consonants mostly , i think ) , so i 'd start there , that way reading dutch words in text makes more sense . 
  well , i love greece . 
  there , up yours , you banker-brainwashed kuteuropeans !, 
   and the dutch are awesome . 
  i sense an annexation coming, 
  a dutch man called baukelien wtf ;d in any case ... 
  i think the map shows that traveling france , especially near the edges of those territories , will lead to endless moments of awkwardness ... 
  i mean , such division even in the country itself ... why ? 
  what happens when two people from different regions meet in a third region ? 
  this is madness . 
  this is great . 
  i intend to learn portuguese , but where do i start ? 
  i can take a local course ( and i probably will ) , but anything online for free that 's good ? 
  edit : spelling, 
   he 's not given the order . 
  so yes , he 's responsible , but he 's no more guilty on this particular case than bush was guilty for the abu ghraib abuses and the like . 
  first of all , *** yes , bush and rumsfeld were responsible for the abu ghraib abuses *** . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abu_ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse#authorization_of_torture an executive order is issued by the president , and plenty has been written about rumsfeld 's responsibility , who works for bush . 
  as for putin : he sent the gru into ukraine to destabilize it further after annexing crimea . 
  not even strelkov , who enthusiastically announced the shootdown of mh17 on social media before realizing it was a civilian aircraft after which he took down his post , denies that they triggered and subsequently increasingly got involved in the war in east ukraine . 
  http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russia-s-igor-strelkov-claims-responsibility-for-unleashing-war-in-ukraine/511584.html we know what brigade the buk is from , thanks to bellingcat . 
  we know who was discussing what surrounding the shootdown , thanks to the sbu . 
  we know that some of people are directing units with buks on the ground one minute , and phoning with moscow the next . 
  putin and his propaganda arms like russia today and sputnik news are spreading lie after lie about mh17 , one even more ridiculous than the other , he is shielding the perpetrators and pointing the finger at ukraine instead , be it with a ridiculous story about a sukhoi shooting down mh17 or an `` ukrainian buk '' , without even considering the fact that advancing multiple mutually exclusive stories at the same time inevitably *** destroys your credibility *** . 
  i will never forgive putin . 
   a lot of people escape death in texas every day considering the amount of guns over there ... 
  yes , if you 're willing to equate politically and ideologically motivated terror attacks with two jihadists in body armor with automatic weapons intending to inflict mass casualties with everyday shootings , then sure . 
  the only reason this fizzled the way it did is because of excellent security provided because they did take copious precautions . 
  have you seen the guys who did the security there ? 
  very , very texan ;-) check it out . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmrv2wn97yy#t=1m50s although reportedly the actual work there was achieved by a first line cop who is a crack shot , apparently . 
  but anyway , on that note , let 's completely do away with discussing terror attacks altogether , because `` shootings '' . 
  i 'm sorry , i ca n't go along with that sort of brushing under the carpet . 
  it 's not a reasonable assessment of the situation . 
  terror attacks do occur , including on artists , journalists , politicians and writers . 
  both in the west and in the middle east . 
   on a more serious note , yeah , it 's bad that it happened but what exactly is your point ? 
  that this is n't just wilders trying get headlines again , which he does try ; he and pamela geller just escaped death at the hands of the people they 're ridiculing . 
  this is n't rocket science . 
  i 'm not a wilders voter , his party logo reminds me of the nsb . 
  but we 're pretty hypocritical about our criticism of the backwardness of christianity on the hand and criticism about islam on the other . 
  islam does n't deserve any additional special consideration over christianity . 
   this is in leeuwarden by the way , i can imagine the countryside may lag a little behind . 
  which is where i live . 
  people are hurting over here . 
  i 'm glad you 're doing well for yourself . 
  i 'm not , the burough i grew up in in leeuwarden has been rated the poorest in the country several times , and this region just does n't have any money , employment and influence . 
  maybe there 's some light at the end of the tunnel . 
  http://www.lc.nl/friesland/ecoregio/werkloosheid-daalt-sterk-in-noorden-18568583.html who knows . 
   the economic crisis is over , unemployment is going down where in friesland exactly is this economic boom going on ? 
  let me know about it , because i ca n't see it with my own eyes . 
  also , wilders just escaped death in texas . 
  i 'd like to weigh in on this if i can : i 've bought multiple piano versions of satie and to me there 's only one composer/performer who does the pieces justice , by playing them slowly and deliberately : reinbert de leeuw . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbqqkmpv0ue the reactions in the comment section seem to agree . 
  i 've got another version where satie is played as if a robot was churning out notes . 
  after hearing de leeuw , you just ca n't go anywhere else anymore for piano performances of satie . 
  all other renderings , such as the one in this video or on harp , or even jazzrock versions i 've heard , the more the merrier , 
   according to who ? 
  competing claims include : * indonesia , china , and taiwan over waters ne of the natuna islands * the philippines , china , and taiwan over scarborough shoal . 
  * vietnam , china , and taiwan over waters west of the spratly islands . 
  some or all of the islands themselves are also disputed between vietnam , china , taiwan , brunei , malaysia , and the philippines . 
  * the paracel islands are disputed between the prc/roc and vietnam . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_china_sea#territorial_claims the rest of your comment , well , i 'm not really interested , really . 
  for example , national interest magazine complains about american hypocrisy . 
  ** but i 'm not american ** . 
  when will you russians get this through your thick heads ? 
  that there exists other countries in this world except the u.s. and russia ? 
   deliberately enter in china airspace to spy on them . 
  what part of :  fly aggressive air drills 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , 365 days a year ? 
  do n't you understand ? 
   you still did that two days ago . 
  i 'm not american . 
  you do n't know my nationality ( yet ) . 
  it would be prudent to assume i was european , since we 're in / r/europe and all . 
  also , just because my english is outstanding , that does n't mean i 'm british or irish either . 
  ;-) and . . china is claiming way more territory than it deserves . 
   us still do that with china do what ?
