  fly aggressive air drills 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , 365 days a year ? 
  that has absolutely * nothing * to do with your source , which documents a single incident with a spy plane . 
  what incredible foresight . 
  what an article . . in the washington times of all media . 
  and kuhner of all people . 
  have an upvote . 
  the `` separatist '' uprising in the east was manufactured almost entirely by the gru . 
  igor girkin ca n't help himself and keeps bragging about it or reflects much more openly on it than do other gru agents who conducted `` maskirovka '' in ukraine and crimea .

  read and watch timothy snyder . 
  this is moderator sentiment too , is it not ? 
   yes , that 's specifies in the law , but its not obvious in this case . 
  it is if a guarantee is given . 
   also , the highlighted part is the consequence of the unhighlighted part , the process you described earlier follows the initial review . 
  the is explained perfectly fine in the actual source , which is the swedish government . 
  i 'm not going to go back and forth on this any further , i do n't have the time unfortunately . 
  stating that the `` uk police can go in any time they like , so long as . . '' is more than a pet peeve . 
  it 's a complete trivialization of the inviolability of embassy grounds . 
  they 're not going in now , just as they did n't go in when pc yvonne fletcher was shot and killed on the streets from inside the libyan embassy . 
  but it does have everything to do with a possible extradition request to sweden if assange goes there . 
   procedure  any state that desires the extradition of a person must make a request for extradition to the central authority , enclosing the report of the investigation on which the application request is based . 
   ** the central authority scrutinises the request to see if there is obvious reason why it should not be approved ; if this is the case , the government shall reject the request without delay . 
  ** http://www.government.se/sb/d/2710/a/15435  and they 're sure as hell not allowed to give any guarantees . 
  where does it say that in the law ? 
  the law shows a sequence of events , but it does n't state that the state may not state their intention to refuse an extradition request if one comes up . 
   then you need to read it again . 
  the order off events is extremely clear . 
  i even highlighted some of the key phrases for you people . 
  yes , order as in when you put on your boxer shorts on before your socks . 
  not order as in : pre-emptive refusal of extradition is illegal . 
  the government has the final say . 
   the investigation into rape was not revived by the government , but by a court after the decision to drop it was appealed by the women 's legal counsel . 
  by a court ? 
  no , not that i 'm aware of :  swedish director of prosecution marianne ny says ** she is reopening ** the rape investigation against mr assange , eleven days after a chief prosecutor announced the arrest warrant had been dropped . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11949341  `` i do n't think there is reason to suspect that he has committed rape , '' says one of stockholm 's chief prosecutors , eva finne . 
  that was ten days earlier . 
  they just could n't make up their mind ...  yes , and if there is no framework , there 's no way of legally doing it . 
  you ca n't climb up a non-existing ladder either . 
  but you can build a ladder . 
  anything that is not illegal is not illegal . 
  this goes without saying . 
   if its not a right given by the law , then its forbidden . 
  you can not * possibly * enumerate everything people or institutions are * allowed * to do . 
  this is an unattainable fantasy : the book of * allowed things * would contain more information than the observable universe could hold . 
   super unbiased source , yet it agrees with me . 
  no it does n't . 
  it cites the swedish government as follows :  procedure  any state that desires the extradition of a person must make a request for extradition to the central authority , enclosing the report of the investigation on which the application request is based . 
   ** the central authority scrutinises the request to see if there is obvious reason why it should not be approved ; if this is the case , the government shall reject the request without delay . 
  ** http://www.government.se/sb/d/2710/a/15435 so , let 's say we go with your `` strict chronological order '' as a matter of legal necessity : you just got served . 
  thanks . 
   i 'm quite familiar with that site and the people it caters to . 
  and i 'm quite familiar with the type of people who will defend their country right * or wrong * , and the type of people who want a less transparent society with less civil liberties , less government transparency and restrictions on the freedom of the press . 
  people who support governments who rule with an iron fist , trampling over the judicial process and human rights , whatever it takes to silence dissent . 
   well , i do n't know if he incited manning . 
  and i do n't know if you beat your wife . 
   i 'm just speculating about what they could possibly try to pin on him . 
  sure , sure . 
   if it was snowden , i 'd agree . 
  no tor networks in the world can prevent contact if the two meet on irc and jabber first , which is the case here . 
  first , it has n't been satisfactorily proven that manning met assange over irc or jabber in the first place . 
  i find this highly entertaining :  johnson testified that he found two attempts to delete data on manning 's laptop . 
  sometime in january 2010 , the computer 's os was re-installed , deleting information prior to that time . 
  then , on or around jan. 31 , someone attempted to erase the drive by doing what 's called a `` zerofill '' -- a process of overwriting data with zeroes . 
  whoever initiated the process chose an option for overwriting the data 35 times -- a high-security option that results in thorough deletion -- but that operation was canceled . 
  later , the operation was initiated again , but the person chose the option to overwrite the information only once -- a much less secure and less thorough option . 
   all the data that johnson was able to retrieve from un-allocated space ** came after that overwrite , he said . 
  ** http://www.wired.com/2011/12/manning-assange-laptop/ after the overwrite ... 
  is n't that interesting , because anybody ( competent ) in it knows , that overwriting once is sufficient :  data on floppy disks can sometimes be recovered by forensic analysis even after the disks have been overwritten once with zeros ( or random zeros and ones ) . ^ [ 22 ] ** this is not the case with modern hard drives : **  * according to the 2006 nist special publication 800-88 section 2.3 ( p. 6 ) : `` basically the change in track density and the related changes in the storage medium have created a situation where the acts of clearing and purging the media have converged . 
  ** that is , for ata disk drives manufactured after 2001 ( over 15 gb ) clearing by overwriting the media once is adequate to protect the media from both keyboard and laboratory attack . 
  '' ** ^ [ 18 ]  * according to the 2006 center for magnetic recording research tutorial on disk drive data sanitization document ( p. 8 ) : `` secure erase does a single on-track erasure of the data on the disk drive . 
  the u.s. national security agency published an information assurance approval [ citation needed ] of single-pass overwrite , after technical testing at cmrr showed that multiple on-track overwrite passes gave no additional erasure . 
  '' ^ [ 23 ] `` secure erase '' is a utility built into modern ata hard drives that overwrites all data on a disk , including remapped ( error ) sectors . ^ [ 24 ]  * further analysis by wright et al. 
  seems to ** also indicate that one overwrite is all that is generally required . 
  ** ^ [ 25 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/data_erasure#number_of_overwrites_needed that throws a different light on things , and for me challenges the authenticity of this `` forensic '' data . 
  manning explicitly said no identifying information was exchanged :  `` due to the strict adherence of anonymity by the wlo [ wikileaks ] , we never exchanged identifying information . 
  however , i believe the individual was likely mr. julian assange [ he pronounced it with three syllables ] , mr. daniel schmidt , or a proxy representative of mr. assange and schmidt . 
  https://justice4assange.com/we-steal-secrets-talking-points,79.html `` belief '' is not evidence . 
  then , we have the matter where the * actual transfer * of the data is done over tor , and that is what matters in terms of `` evidence '' . 
  why put this in quotes ? 
  because assange was a journalistic intermediary and therefore none of this actually matters . 
   yeah , really . 
  inciting crimes is not what journalists normally do . 
  you labelling it `` inciting crimes '' does not make it so , and what 's more , journalists entice sources to provide classified material all the time . 
  so no , not really . 
   you mean the source you clearly did n't read ( nor do i actually think linked to it ) ? 
  i read what you cited , i presume i can trust you ? 
  or ca n't i ? 
   the government has addressed it though . 
  they have described the legal protection he would have . 
  yes , they have . 
  the bolded statement is misleading, 
   the government has the final say after the courts have judged on the legality . 
  no , the government has the final say period , as per your own sources . 
   the government influencing the legal system , even though indirectly , is serious business . 
  indeed , they should n't have revived a baseless rape case as they did . 
  exercising their right to ultimately deny an illegitimate extradition request is not a problem , though , because that 's what swedish law allows , as per your own sources . 
   did you read the parts i quoted ? 
  yes , and i thank you for proving my points . 
   neither the government nor the courts can make guarantees about hypothetical extraditions . 
  if there is `` no legal framework whatsoever '' , there is nothing forbidding them .
