  i do n't understand ... 
  haha i expected a patriotic motto of some sorts . 
  definitely not this . 
  completely unrelated , but what does your flair say ? 
  i presume it is maltese , but what does it mean ? 
  i am interested . 
  i live in bloemendaal and i have personally seen them dig trenches in the beach rather than making hills . 
  old habits die hard i guess . 
  but it will also lead to the establishment of the eternal fyordocracy danmark . 
  i chuckled . 
  jaap is possibly the most dutch name ever . 
  it makes me think of a middle aged man working as administrative manager or something like that . 
  well , officeofhtepresidentoftheunitedstateofamerica is n't a compound word for a start . 
  `` the american presidential office '' would be `` kantoor van de amerikaanse president '' or `` amerikaans presidentieel kantoor '' it works better with words that are all nouns , that 's one of the underlying principles i believe . 
  `` gemeentewegenbelasting '' translates to `` county road tax '' . 
  each word is a specification of the next word , so `` gemeentewegenbelasting '' is a `` belasting '' ( tax ) for `` wegen '' ( roads ) , to be paid to the `` gemeente '' ( county ) . 
  `` kindercarnavalsoptochtvoorbereidingswerkzaamheden '' are the `` werkzaamheden '' ( work ) that needs to be done for the `` voorbereiding '' ( preparation ) of the `` optocht '' ( parade ) during the `` carnaval '' ( carnival ) for `` kinderen '' ( children ) . 
  so , the children 's carnival parade preparation works . 
  there is a video clip floating around the net of a american presenter who desperately tries to hold a straight face when discussing tiny cox 's diplomatic work . 
  there is even a butcher over here in the netherlands called dick kok ( kok being a typical dutch surname ) . 
  http://www.dickkok.nl/ i wonder if he sells conchita wurst . 
  the point is that you started using spaces in between compound words and most other germanic languages did n't . 
   kindercarnavalsoptochtvoorbereidingswerkzaamheden would be  kinder carnavals optocht voorbereidings werkzaamheden when spelled the english way ( which sometimes happens with some dutch compound words spelled by native speakers when somebody is n't that particularly well-versed in dutch grammar . 
  we call it engelse ziekte , english flu ), 
  it is spelled zee-eend , right ? 
  anyway , it is a truly ridiculous word . 
  but then again , the more you expose yourself to information , the more your critical thinking skills improve , particularly your ability to question what you are reading . 
  at least , that 's how it worked for me . 
  this is one of the derpiest maps i have ever seen , if not the derpiest . 
  ohio is just like `` kill me pls '' and california , i do n't know what the f california is doing . 
  also , the complete east coast is tipping over like fuck . 
  my mum and dad were canoeing when the swedish royals visited . 
  the royals were apparently so amused that they halted to take a look at my silly old folks bobbing along on the waves , and they waved back when my mum waved . 
  i thought that was kinda cool . 
  and that , kids , is the story of the great ostrich invasion of cyprus . 
  having never heard of cluj-napoca , i just googled it . 
  it is beautiful !, 
  the second city of the netherlands is rotterdam , one of the largest harbors of the world and the economic powerhouse of the netherlands . 
  it is situated on the mouth of the rhine , making it an important transit port for the ruhr and everything beyond . 
  traditionally , rotterdam is a worker 's city that votes social democrat . 
  it 's mayor is of moroccan-dutch origin , which reflects the multicultural character of the city . 
  my hometown , haarlem , was the second city for a long time in medieval times . 
  since the harbor of amsterdam fell into decline , rotterdam became the second city of the netherlands . 
  it 's metropolitan area is even bigger than amsterdam . 
  during the beginning of the 20th city rotterdam even briefly surpassed amsterdam in number of inhabitants . 
  rotterdam and amsterdam are longtime rivals . 
  this has to do with football more than anything else though . 
  rotterdam is often the butt of jokes in north holland ( the province where amsterdam is situated ) . 
  rotterdam is a lower class city where weird shit happens . 
  at least , that 's the stereotype around here . 
  it was also the birthplace of hardcore/gabber music , our ~ ~ proudest ~ ~ most annoying contribution to the global music scene . 
  i believe rotterdam is very comparable to detroit : large industry boom that made the city grow , partly because of foreign immigrants , and a thriving techno scene which is also remarkably similar to detroit . 
  the important difference is that rotterdam is doing really well economically . 
  rotterdam has an elongated shape , consisting of neighborhoods at each side of the rhine . 
  it is truly a massive city in dutch terms , however a very ugly one at that : in wwii the germans bombed the city centre to force the dutch to surrender , thus eradicating all historical landmarks . 
  it 's city centre is very modern but soulless nowadays thanks to this .

  oh man , as an afca fan this hurt . 
  risk ukraine . 
  finally . 
  that 's a video of the protests in thailand . 
  lots of people probably already saw the carrier vehicle that protesters threw molotov cocktails at , but here is a video of the same incident from another , clearer angle : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=somuxgkblf0, 
  it 's the ukrainian military police . 
  already posted before here , but i 'll post it again , seeing as you are completely clueluess : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parable_of_the_broken_window, 
  right , i did n't realize that . 
  it was n't part of the warsaw pact yes , but it was a communist country . 
  i did n't say `` from one warsaw pact state to another '' but :  from one communist state to another, 
  escaping from one communist state to another always seemed weird to me , until you realize the sheer madness of ceausescu and the intense poverty in romania . 
  almost comparable to north korea , albeit just a tad less famine . 
  la vita e bella is such a beautiful yet sad movie . 
  i wish i could see it again without knowing the plot . 
  your government is really fucked up , is n't it ? 
  it 's like you guys sat down and said to each other : `` you know what will piss people of ? '', 
  try and explore the berlin scene . 
  some great bands to check : chef ` special - funk rock/indie rock . 
  hugely popular . 
  ( yes it is written with an apostrophe ) . 
  mister and mississippi - indie pop/folk kyteman - jazz/hip-hop ( has his own live orchestra , very independent approach to music , probably the truest indie musician of all on this list . 
  runs his own musical commune ) . 
  treasure of grundo - shoegaze/indietronica those foreign kids - noise rock wolvon - noise rock, 
  the lack of punctation made me read it like you were an excited yet inebriated scotsman at a bar . 
  yeah i know that you speak a roman language . 
  the thing is , that particular way of `` chilling '' is informally known as the slav squat because * most * countries in eastern europe are slavic . 
  in my social circle , a lot of people do , tbh . 
  and it 's just a stereotype . 
  it is not necessarily accurate . 
  ** the lesser known countries and territories : ** faeroer is the small brother of denmark . 
  for some odd region , he is into religion . 
  he whines that denmark should go to church more often . 
  he is slightly homophobic . 
  malta prefers to be alone . 
  lots of people , including many african countries and the maghrib want to date her , but deep in her heart she knows that she would only be a way for them to date other european countries more easily . 
  her room is very small and crowded with furniture , so whenever she is in her room , she has to move very carefully as to not tip over some ancient piece of furniture . 
  liechtenstein is a blonde , short , but very rich kid whose idol is his big nephew switzerland . 
  he has his flaws though : he considers his word law . 
  he does not want anybody else to decide for him . 
  san marino is the small brother of italy . 
  he collects stamps and coins , like vatican city , his best friend . 
  svalbard is the depressed sister of norway . 
  she was recently admitted to the hospital with hypothermia .
