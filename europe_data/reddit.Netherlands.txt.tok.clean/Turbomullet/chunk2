  * `` i 've always been fond of the idea of technocracy because who is better to run the country than people who know what they 're doing ? 
  '' * in my opinion that type of democracy works best on a smaller scale where those who are elected stand closer to those that elect them , and therefore have a tighter grasp on what is needed . 
  for me , and i think for al lot of people the only thing that stand between following narrowmindend and anarchistic/tribal instincts is a sense of loyalty trust and alieance with the people i can share a culture and a language with for hundreds of years . 
  the failure of the euro is a great example of how you ca n't just force a uniform format to so much different cultures with soo much different types of economic and social structures.the same will go for a political union . 
  after wwll there has been great prosperity of the nations working together but as of now , it is moving too fast . 
  a referendum wil suggest if the people of europe are ready and in previous ones the answer was no clearly so i do n't see furter intergration doing any good . 
  i am very glad you ask that question . 
  first of all it is silly to just make an assumption like that based on what political parties are represented especially when it 's about something so important . 
  after 9/11 the dutch christian democrat prime minister balkenende deceided to support the war on terror by sending dutch troops in to the that country . 
  later however it was revealed by an official and independed commission that there was not enough mandate for such a war and it was a great blow for the christian democrat party . 
  just because the elected leaders make certain desicions does not mean it is the will of the people . 
  ofcourse democracy is never perfect but it is absolutely vital to hold a refendum when it comes to issues like this . 
  if the people feel that they are not ready culturally , socially or in any way to be part of a larger union then their leaders must abide to that . 
  ofcourse there are arguments that support further intergration but letting our leaders just deceide what is best for the people even if they mean well it is called a ` technocracy ' . 
  this on it 's own creates a gap between the people and their leaders ultimatly giving way to national extremists and social unrest like what is happening in greece now . 
  actually there was a referendum in holland about the european constitution and further intergreation and we voted against 2 out of 3 . 
  the eurocrats should have learned then and there is no mandate from the peoples of the seperate nations . 
  also the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities is somehting that is already being upheld in our own constiturion thank you very much , and just because the super catholic nations like poland and ireland treat woman and minorities like shit is not going to be solved magically by a universal constitution because these are social and cultural isseus . 
  the bare reality is simple : a political federal union will be harmfull for the democracy of the souvereign nations period . 
  we the people refuse to elect foreign politicians to make decisions that are sopposed to be elected nationally . 
  there will be no refendum because the outcome will clearly be no . 
  instead it will just be forced upon us leaving an ideological void to be filled by nationalist and right wing extremists . 
  the euro failed , so will the political union . 
  no refferendum means no federation and that is the end of that . 
  democracy loses . 
  that 's a nice version of the israeli flag you got there !, 
  why the hell is your flag even an option in this subreddit ? 
  because ` federalism ' does n't have that lubrecating quality that words like * ` peace ' * and * ` unity ' * have . 
  when you fuck somebody up the asshole you ca n't just jam your dick in there dry right away . 
  you got to start with a wet pinky and slowly move around the anus trying to make it a little moist and relax . 
  then ease in to two or three fingers just gliding it in nice and slowly . 
  before you know it , you got the entire e.u-cock jammed so far in your stinker you would not even notice it is there . 
  a job well done . 
  any frisians up in this *** ? 
  i do actually , we are all fucked in the end . 
  the euro made everything more expensive for everybody . 
  i hate to say i told you so . 
  because . . uhm ... uhm ... uhm ... something about working together and building a bright future or something . 
  as much as i find ` nationalism ' a rather crued device for protecting a nation 's interesst it 's a mindset i prefer over the anti-democratic technocraty that europe is becomming on a political level . 
  it 's moving the decision making away from those more directly involved that leaves a void of loyalty to be filled with cheap populistic rethorics and far-right traditionalist sentiments . 
  i say the europhiles are getting exactly what they deserve when it comes to that . 
  so , now what ? 
  more laws ? 
  more ' government awareness programs ' ?

  is there nothing or nobody that can stop this man ? 
  united in the 10th century and all they contributed in more than thousand years was lars ulrich and a cartoon that pisses off muslims . 
  they do n't deserve tourists . 
  fuck the danish !, 
  all of them where picked last in gym class . 
  but who is laughing now ? 
  now they are big important men , responsible for trillions of euro 's .

  i would rather be part the united kingdom than this euro disaster . 
  man this war is really coming closer to our doorstep !, 
  the beauty about national teams is that is has nothing to do with money . 
  club football is just buying the right players , basicly it 's just the richest teams that end up in the finals everytime . 
  national football is passionate and suprising , country 's like sweden or russia can suddenly suprise the whole world with their technique and fierceness . 
  however , this year ofcourse holland will win . 
  when the euro was first instated nobody could have predicted the problems we are in now , that alone should be reason why the people in charge should be distrusted completely but i 'm going to let that aside and rephrase what i already said before : when agreeing upon a unified currency one agrees on a unified worth . 
  less rich countrys like greece and spain decided to jump in because they where hopefull and let 's be honest they wanted that same peace of the pie that the richer country 's had on their plates . 
  and i do n't blame them either . 
  however you ca n't unify completely different country 's with different cultures , work ethics , tax structures , social benefits and pension sctructures under 1 worth . 
  thats when you need political unification , and thus the european commision grew in power in an attemptto unify europe on all of these levels . 
  1 law , 1 coin , and 1 central government . 
  now we see a global economy based on the same principle fail in need for billions upon billions of state injections to keep the whole thing from falling apart . 
  at the same time there is a loss in trust in the worth of the euro on a person to person and private free market basis , going against the grain of what mainstream pro-euro politics and media is promoting . 
  and as i said again : currency needs the markets and consumers faith to survive , not billions upon billions of injections into a european black-hole to artificially keep it going , thus cutting funds on social programs needed in the country 's themselfs . 
  that is a very twisted form of socialisme where nobody wins expect the super rich in and influential . 
  the gouverment in my country ( holland ) are actually making ** million ** euro budget cuts on culture , welfare , education and healthcare to spend ** billions ** of euro 's to support somehting they voted against . 
  meanwhile the national debt grows and grows that is something fundametally fucked . 
  and thats why i promote euro-scepsis as a whole and not just speak against the euro as a coin . 
  the major issue of the global financial system is exactly that it has become too large and complex to benefit seperate nations or let alone local economies . 
  if you were to argue that this is a natural process of capitalisme useless to fight against with romantic ideas about souvereignity i would grant you that point of view because it 's realistic , even though i do not agree with it . 
  however the euro as a financial and economic system completely consumes the overal political and social systems of seperate nations without any good reason . 
  and thats where it becomes a prestige project . 
  our borders are naturally disappearing through market globalisation and internet communication . 
  but that is on a private and buisiness level , actually creating oppertunitys for the average joe . 
  the big political machine does not like this and imposes this undemocratic , monolithic system under the banner of european unity and the disapearing of borders . 
  again , the french and the dutch voted against the european constitution , and i 'm sure that if put to vote the euro would not have survived . 
  there is no faith left in currency because there is no faith in these technocrats at the wheel of these big goverment systems , that alone should be proof that it does not work . 
  a currency needs faith by the people who use it right ? 
  also with your responce you completely avoid what i explained about the relation between law , politics and currency by whiping it off the table , reasoning that the same issues occur on smaller levels well duh . 
  ofcourse they do . 
  with the euro and the unquestioned power of the european comission you are doing nothing more than taking the power to a place where you and me ca n't reach , as of now there is now way to hold the people in power responsible for their incompetence and greed , because the european commissions are unelected people with way too much power and personal interrests . 
  that is total anti-free market thinking . 
  that is communisme !, 
  that is also a natural political process driven the desire to unify and control large groups of people , wich in turn sparks a flame for anarchism and nationalism to flourish within grassroots movements , creating a void of trust to be filled by oppertunist , populists and xenofobia . 
  again it is the arrogance of the europhiles and the complete distance to what is important to the people of it 's nations that is creating these movements , feeding of the injustice of billions and billions of tax euro 's going anywhere but towards a nations local interessets while at the same time cutting money for education and wellfare because a bunch cowboys ` accidentally the economy ' it 's more than the lack of correcting imbalances and fancy economic talk . 
  it 's about believing in the idea of building an economy upon oppertunity , trust and tangible value without forcing it through our mouths with shrude political games and empty rethorics . 
  this is why i do n't shower with other guys at the gym ... 
  oh yes , exactly . 
  a national bank can be as undemocratic and corruopt a larger european system of finance . 
  that is a slighty different sotry about how money is created out of debt and the whole global financial system is flawed to the core , that in essence says nothing about europan finance , i 'll grant you that . 
  the problem lies on how it works on a political level . 
  the more unified a nation is by law and politics the better a unfied currency works . 
  for example the united states has no souvereign states , there are very clear federal laws , and there is some limited room for states to decide about gay marriage , and the death penalty etc.
