  i do n't know really know . 
  but if you look at r/cirkeltrek a lot of typical internet phrases like ftfy are translated into english very literally , so i did the same for make the netherlands great again . 
  i guess it 's also nice to be able to speak your own language on the internet , because a lot of media is english , especially compared to france and germany i think . 
  new kids is one of our great cultural products . 
  the eu actually does organise missions sometimes . 
  to mali for instance . 
  unfortunately the first classico this season will be at 16:15 , because of asian tv audiences or something . 
  yep . 
  catalonia is the richest and hardworking region ever , and they finance the entire spanish budget . 
  the rest of spain is siesta and ma\u00f1ana . 
  everyone in catalonia wants to be independent , but the dictatorship of rajoy does n't let them . 
  that 's roughly the image we get of the political situation in spain from the media . 
  yep , at ( public ) school in the netherlands we learned that the netherlands is pluriform , tried to become multicultural , but it did n't work . 
  from what i 've experienced , read and know about france i think it 's roughly the same there . 
  i see it more as jealousy , but then again i 'm an arrogante ollander . 
   so where would you start to investigate ? 
  the ira , clearly . 
  if we would translate all those english show names and songtexts in dutch we would probably think they sound really stupid haha . 
  the reason we have minimum wages is that the free market does not always reach a good solution . 
  if these uber drivers are effectively earning less than minimum wage , something needs to be done about it . 
  and if a majority is in favour of forcing something upon a minority , it is still forcing upon them and it can be unconstitutional , see the legalisation of gay marriage in the us even though in some places a majority was against it . 
  ironically you wrote ` large numbers ' in your comment . 
  large numbers of muslims do not support these terrorist attacks . 
  of course the reaction to the photo taking incident was way too strong , but i would n't like having pictures taken off me because of clothing i 'm wearing as well . 
  you still have the right to privacy in a public area . 
  that 's why faces are sometimes blurred . 
  lol now you 're denying things i have never even accused the republican party of . 
  i only said they 're forcing religious values upon people , which they do . 
  just like you said , a lot of political parties are trying to do this , including three in the netherlands that i do n't support for that reason . 
  the thing is i have not witnessed ` large numbers of ' muslims trying to force religious values upon people in europe . 
  of course they do try to follow their religious values themselves , but i do n't see how prohibiting women who work for the government to wear headscarves will help making sure they do n't force religious values upon people . 
  it only makes sure that they themselves ca n't follow their own religious values . 
  this political party you might have heard of is called the * republican party * which majority ideology is , according to wikipedia , american conservatism . 
  this is a broad system of political beliefs in the united states that is characterized by , amongst others , ** judeo-christian values ** . 
  american conservatives consider individual liberty , within the bounds of conformity to american values and ** christian morals ** , as the fundamental trait of democracy . 
  apparently , as we have witnessed in the past decades and are witnessing to this day , some of the bounds these christian morals call for are gay marriage , abortion and euthanasia . 
  sources : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_party_ ( united_states ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conservatism_in_the_united_states, 
  i really do n't understand your last few paragraphs . 
  you 're from a country were one of the two political parties tries to force religious values upon people all the time , see the republican opposition against gay marriage , abortion , euthanasia . 
  now there are people in europe that do n't have a political party , of which only a very small part tries to force their religious values upon people , while the rest only follows it . 
  wearing a headscarf is in that respect not different from wearing a cross . 
  edit : this is obviously anecdotal , but i live in a neighbourhood and a city with a lot of muslims and of all those muslims i have never met even one that said : ` you should become muslim ' or ` you should not eat pork ' or ` you should not drink alcohol ' . 
  it 's always ' i do n't eat pork because of my religion ' ' i wear a headscarf because of my religion ' ' i do n't have sex before marriage because of my religion ' . 
  i did not say that about charlie hebdo so i 'm sorry , but thanks for assuming i did . 
  and it was not about the burkini , it was about the segregation , which is worsened because of such bylaws . 
  muslims feeling out of touch with a society will certainly lower the bar for attacking that society . 
  you know all the terrorists in france were born in france and grew up there right ? 
  you see , this is the attitude that completely disconnects people from society and creates terrorists . 
  and what does the french constitution have to do with it ? 
  as far as i know there 's no article in it preventing women from wearing burkinis . 
  these local bylaws are just some reactionary measures because people want to take ` revenge ' against terrorism . 
  yes of course they can go . 
  but their religion/morals/family prevent it in a lot of the cases . 
  in that case you would n't see ` protofascism ' on the beach anymore , but do you honestly think keeping those women out of touch with western civilisation completely is better for integration than that they sit on the beach wearing different clothing ? 
  lol a tradition that covering your head of impolite . 
  covering your face is impolite , that 's true , but if you look at different kinds of traditional clothing in the netherlands , they almost all have some kind of head covering . 
  this is a bit of a generalisation , which i think is very wrong in the context of secularism in europe . 
  there are huge differences between countries . 
  england has a state church , of which the queen is the head . 
  france is traditionally very secular , forbidding people from showing religious symbols in public buildings etc. 
  germany is being expanded on in this thread , but they also seem to be a secular state , even though the government helps collecting church taxes . 
  my own country , the netherlands , is not that secular , even though more than 40 % is not religious . 
  in the constitution it is stated that religious schools have the right to receive state funding like public schools ( they are still monitored closely so there is no anti-evolution propaganda or something ) . 
  there used to even be a bible in the parliament . 
  organisations that tried to forbid religious symbols such as headscarfs were stopped by judges belonging to various courts . 
  i 'm sure other european countries have different ways of separating church and state , if they do so , but i do n't know much about that . 
  i meant here on reddit . 
  if i do n't see the problem , like many other people here , i 'm not going to waste my time thinking of a solution . 
  i obviously disagree with the majority of france which is not weird as they were raised in a culture of secularism , while the netherlands is almost the opposite ( see special schools : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_school_ ( netherlands ) ), 
  i think most people agree there is no problem with the burkini . 
  you know what they might wear to the beach ? 
  normal clothing with a headscarf . 
  oh wait , they ca n't , because then you end up getting stripped by the police . 
  be realistic . 
  you think now they 'll suddenly sit in bikini on the beach ? 
  the only thing that will come from this is even more muslim women staying at home , out of touch with society . 
  they are segregated even more now that they ca n't go to the beach at all anymore ... 
  yep , and then the earthquake hits the next town :(, 
  a lot of them are hundreds of years old and it is probably way to expensive to renovate them to be earthquake proof . 
  she is wearing normal muslim clothing millions of muslims in france and the rest of europe have been wearing for decades , and now it is suddenly a problem ? 
  come on man , i was not being serious . 
  but you can predict pretty well , based on all the sports events before the olympics , which athletes are going to perform well . 
  even if 2 out of 3 in my hypothetical example would end up with a medal , eu would still end highest . 
  no of course , but following that logic there is never any guarantee that any country will win any medal . 
  maybe next olympics the us will send the wrong athlete in every sport and end up with 0 medals . 
  who knows ? 
  yeah but you could , apart from team sports in which eu countries won multiple medals , send the athletes that won medals now right ? 
  of course some would be in bad form etc. , but i think the eu would still have a high chance of winning the medal rank . 
  or if you 're gay . 
  or if you 're at school . 
  yeah i never meant to say that latvia is a dangerous country or something , that 's why i said i did n't want to be disrespectful to latvia . 
  i was just looking at the statistics like the person i responded too . 
  that something is right . 
  i hope to visit latvia sometime in the future , but i have indeed never been there . 
  you ca n't deny however that in terms of murder rate , latvia is one of the worst countries in europe ( according to wikipedia ) . 
  if a country with such a high gdp per capita and so much power as the us is satisfied with being on par with latvia , they are honestly aiming a bit low . 
  i think so too , cause while i 've never been to latvia , i feel quite safe in the dangerous neighbourhoods in utrecht . 
  but i do n't think i would feel that safe in the dangerous neighbourhoods in riga to be honest . 
  european murder rates also vary wildly from country to country , from 0.5 in austria and switzerland ( the lowest when excluding iceland , andorra and san marino ) to 9.5 in russia , or 5.5 in lithuania as the highest eu member . 
  there are 32 countries with a murder rate lower than belgium .
