  i do not see how that is relevant .

  but why are we dutch ? 
  - king 's day today !, 
  do i need to notify / r/thenetherlands as well ? 
  i like how there is literally a tank in the middle of a tourist beach . 
  we will build a wall and let them pay for it !,

  indeed . 
  in theory , yes , noticeable in the world , not so much . 
  the energy is generated through rising and falling air , which is motion . 
  the air moves since it is `` heated '' by evaporating water from the oceans , and cooled when it rains and the water vapor condenses ( taking energy with it ) . 
  and so the cycle of life continues . 
  thank you very much . 
  thank you for that !, 
  will point that out in my comment !, 
  do you have any sources ? 
  * only thing i can offer is a lot of water and some grass from our polders *, 
  * sell me your glorious meat and dairy products * ... 
  by eating w\u00fcrst !, 
  the average german has three for each eye . 
  thanks for the actual source !, 
  upvotes for you !, 
  i think i did n't word it correctly . 
  calling it a `` meltdown '' . 
  i meant to say that some of the fuel was starting to melt , but the reactor was shut down to prevent further melting . 
  no permanent damage was done . 
  the only death i could find was in an explosion at a fuel processing plant , not in a reactor . 
  concerning the electrical grid , the problems in france were mostly the * outward * lines failing ( at the energy distribution centre ) . 
  not the backup lines heading into the generator . 
  fukushima 's failure was an exeptional situation indeed , and as it showed , neccesary precautions were not taken . 
  therefore , strict laws and policies are implemented here ( nl ) , even to tale precautions against things that are higly unlikely . 
  * and windmills slow down the wind and therefore cause global warming * - former us politician, 
  i do n't know everything about this subject , nor do i claim to , but in the japanese accidents people were killed , and in the french accidents the most severe one was a meltdown in progress , which was shut down successfully , and no one was killed in any accident . 
  also , most french accidents had to do with the energy infrastructure around the plant , and not the plant or the nuclear process itself ( nuclear furnace near a plant malfunctioning , electrical grid at power hq failing etc. . ) sorry for not replying earlier , kinda busy atm . 
  yes . 
  [ see the nuclear disasters section here ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_power_in_japan ) . 
  * and also because the night crew in chernobyl was incompetent *, 
  you do realize that the fukushima plant was one of the older plants ? 
  older than the tsjernobyl one ? 
  ( [ tsjernobyl ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/chernobyl_nuclear_power_plant ) [ fukushima ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/fukushima_daiichi_nuclear_power_plant ) ) a more modern plant a few tens of kilometers away had no problems shutting down and preventing meltdown . 
  tsjernobyl did indeed happen due to soviet incompetence . 
  a night-shift crew who was not trained for emergency situations was told to ramp up energy production . 
  good idea !, 
  ( a few things i mentioned above are not correct , as pointed out by / u/mcvarial , please refer to his comment for correct details . ), 
  the western nuclear plants are incedibly safe , due to extremely strict policies and laws . 
  have you ever heard of any problems in france ? 
  they use about 70 % nuclear . 
  of course there are a few problems , but those are resolved quickly and profesionally . 
  ( [ france ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_power_in_france ) ) for your and my relevance , the nuclear reactor in borssele is one of the safest reactors there is , and of course there have been laxer laws in the past , and there have been some problems , but those problems have quickly been resolved due to well-educated staff , while the reactor was shut down successfully . 
  when building new plants , of course this would require a lot of investment , but why not invest in thorium ? 
  ( [ 1 ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/thorium-based_nuclear_power ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/thorium.aspx ) ) nuclear does n't only mean uranium reactors . 
  this was already done in the usa in the cold war , but was dismantled due to the inability to weaponize thorium . 
  is n't it just convenient that the anti-nuclear party forgets to mention this stuff ? 
  of course nuclear is n't perfect . 
  the startup cost is expensive , but it is bloody efficient . 
  and safe , contrary to common belief . 
  if there is anything i missed or stated wrongfully , please send me the source and i 'll edit it . 
  as well . 
  i think ( hope ) he was being sarcastic . 
  maybe they used vodka vapours ? 
  did you get rid of the other poles ? 
  [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/hrbbqva.jpg ) is our glorious navy !, 
  we polder you !, 
  dont ask me how , we 'll find a way . 
  i was actually talking about my flair ... 
  but i do indeed think that a better relationship would benefit all . 
  hmmm . 
  [ benelux unite ? 
  and not for extra exploitation . 
  got it . 
  any way you 'd back me up retaking it ? 
  hmmmm ... what about my east indies ? 
  do i still have those ? 
  as a brit you have the exclusive right to always complain about the french . 
  how about we tear it up and pretend it never happened ? 
  yes . 
  shall i start fabricating a claim ? 
  or can we still claim to retake our cores ? 
  fair enough . 
  i 'm not serious ` bout hating germany though , i believe it 's kind of a circlejerk going on around here . 
  something about football . 
  i do n't know why i know this . 
  i do n't even like football . 
  new kids disagrees, 
  in soviet netherlands we blitzkrieg you !, 
  what about friesland ? 
  welp . 
  relevant flair i guess . 
  no but i do n't agree with quite a few things wilders says , but do know that you are always welcome flanders !, 
  ( maybe wallonia too if you accept your new master culture ), 
  but why do n't you help hating the germans ? 
  right you are lad , right you are ... 
  if only i could claim the same thing ... but i 'm stuck with tulips and polders . 
  but muh vikings :(, 
  well , starting with keeping most ` refugees ' out would help i guess , and maybe the member states should think more collectively instead of just on national scale . 
  then again , i 'm not a politician , nor am i of the right age to vote , so i guess i 'm not really in the position to say anything about the matter .
