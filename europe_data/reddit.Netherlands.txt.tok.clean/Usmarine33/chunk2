  i was just trying to say that i think it would be a huge shame if the eu were to fall apart , since i personally think that every country for itself is not going to work if we want to stay relevant . 
  but that 's just my opinion . 
  pls eu get your shit together . 
  please do n't fall apart :(, 
  that it is n't part of the netherlands . 
  [ ahem .

  ^ ^ ^ as ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ belgians . 
  congrats , my lads !, 
  yes .

  ^ ^ ^ ^ soon ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ annexation ^ ^ ^ ^ begins, 
  that justifies it . 
  no seriously . 
  i personally would not stop them .

  empire sweet empire . 
   the greater * dutch * republic . 
  ftfy :p, 
  some things remain . 
  do not reveal the secret plans !, 
  i might only be looking from that point of view then . 
  then again , i 'm no history genious , and my historical fact accuracy is quite low . 
  it 's just these little things ( like napoleon ) which i remember . 
  i indeed misread it . 
  but still . 
  for some kind of reason if the dutch and english/british do something together , it almost always results in victory . 
  i wonder ... 
  indeed . 
  if you look at history , the amount of times `` we '' got occupied , it 's a miracle `` we '' are still independent . 
  believe me , if i could go back in time ... unfourtunately i can not . 
  relationship actions : send diplomatic insult . 
  covert actions : fabricate claim on : all of it, 
  ... maybe . 
  dammit !, 
  our plan is foiled !, 
  yes !, 
  we must continue in our quest for glorious world domination !, 
  just execute order `` annexium belgica '', 
  * hush !, 
  * we must not let them know !, 
  just hand everything to us !, 
  * ` ahem ' * * ` cough ' * no but seriously , it would be up to the belgians . 
  i would n't mind really . 
  i 'd love it actually [ groot-nederland .

  username checks out, 
  actually , the funny thing is , by keeping our polder dry , we are actually lowering the land . 
  most ( pretty much all ) of the soil in the polders is made of peat , which is just dead plant stuff with a load of water . 
  so by pumping out the water to keep the top layer dry , we actually have to keep pumping out more water , since more and more water from rivers ( and also the sea ! ), 
  will flow into the polders . 
  thus , more water gets removed , and the land will keep getting lower . 
  also salination of the soil because sea water . 
  also rip the netherlands wait . 
  dikes . 
  to be honest antwerpen is pretty nice . 
  he at least tried !, 
  he can stay . 
  awesome !, 
  that was quick !, 
  congratulations by the way !, 
  kind of already did that a couple of decades ago .
