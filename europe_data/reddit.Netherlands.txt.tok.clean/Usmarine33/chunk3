  exactly one of the reasons i will not vote for him . 
  he does n't do what he claims . 
  although most of our politicians do n't ... 
  he had some points . 
  but lately i 've been disagreeing with him more and more . 
  i 'll even contribute $ 30 ( about # 680 ) !, 
  yeeeeah ... i 'm not voting fot him anymore . 
  maybe i 'll come visit someday . 
  and bring yurop goodies .
