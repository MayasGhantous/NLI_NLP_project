  but i kind of want that as an extra passport cover though . 
  like one of those little sleeves you can put over your passport . 
   brother < 3 < 3, 
  our coins have our current king on them , so no i think . 
  bikes for r/belgium ... well , we can always go back to r/indonesia to get more rubber . 
  sorry not sorry southern neighbours . 
  while we 're at it , can we have r/luxembourg as well ? 
  hey , cyprus is still on the list !, 
  oh , and i am from the netherlands , so you did n't miss anything , 
  yeah , i know the feeling . 
  luckily gouda survives the trip very well , but some kinds of pastries that i really like wo n't make the trip without fungus ... 
  hey there !, 
  you just did !, 
  hey there !, 
  we can most definitely discuss things via pm , do n't worry about it . 
  consider yourself in !, 
  pay denbts !, 
  hey there !, 
  thanks for saying that , it probably assures some people that i 'm not just trying to get free stuff . 
  i send stuff to your personal preferences , so if you have any restrictions or preferences , just tell me !, 
  sound like names from fantasy movies , or rpgs like dungeons & dragons, 
  that 's amazing , thank you very much !, 
  in case i get a response , shall i let you know so that you can un-sticky ? 
  i do n't need more than maybe 2 responses !, 
  again , thank you very much !, 
  * shakes fist *, 
  what is this object you speak of ? 
  get a room you two , but do n't accidentally create another switzerland . 
  just like old times . 
  belgian ( flemish especially ) fries are best . 
  his first kill tonight, 
   eu leaders have also congratulated themselves about their humbleness and effectiveness . 
  read the description !, 
  hey europeans !, 
  a few weeks ago i did a cultural exchange with a fellow from the uk . 
  i really enjoyed that , and i 'd like to do that with more people from around europe . 
  what i 'm proposing is me sending a box of goodies from my country ( netherlands ) , and you sending me a box of goodies from yours . 
  i 'd like to try and make this a monthly thing , in where every month i 'll pick a country at random . 
  this way , except for only consuming good stuff , i 'd like to learn a bit more about your daily life in other countries , since i 'm really interested in european culture . 
  examples of things i 'd like to try : - cookies typical to your country - sweets - dried sausages and/or cheese ( no smelly cheese france ! ), 
  - things you put on your bread - local spirits/liquors - i like pretty much anything , so send me whatever you 'd like me to try !, 
  examples of things i 'll send you : - hagelslag - stroopwafels - sweets - if you 'd like , a regional spirit/liquor - cheese of course - anything local by request !, 
  do keep in mind though , that the stuff has to survive an average of 7 days of travel , so do n't send stuff that goes bad quickly . 
  and also , i 'm starting a flag collection , so if you could send me your countries flag ( preferably 1m x 1.5 m ) , i 'll send you one of mine as well !, 
  i 'm thinking of a price range of around $ 20 , or your local heathen equivalent , excluding shipping and the flag . 
  if you 'd like a different one , we can discuss that through pm of course . 
  #this month 's country : ~ ~ finland ~ ~ denmark !, 
  due to a lack of finnish response ( probably too socially awkward ) , i have rerolled the country , the result is denmark !, 
  / u/weneedtofederalize has claimed the spot . 
  thanks all , for showing your interest !, 
  i 'll keep track of the countries i 've had through colouring [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/7qwrhcu ) map , sou you can keep track of it as well . 
  and i 'll also make an album of stuff i have received , which you can see [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/hnqqw ) . 
  allrighty then , if it 's your turn this month , please do leave a comment , and i 'll send you a pm and edit the thread !, 
  i 'll be back in a bit to check out the comments . 
  cheers ! .

  hey europeans !, 
  i 'm three days late with posting due to a holiday in antwerp , but now that i 'm back home , i can continue !, 
  after a successful first month ( thanks / u/weneedtofederalize !, 
  ) , i decided i 'm going to continue doing this , since i really enjoyed trying stuff from a different country . 
  ( copypasta explanation below ) the idea is that i send you a package with goodies from my country ( netherlands ) to you , and you send one from yours to me !,
