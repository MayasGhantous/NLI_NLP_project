  hey all !, 
  i 've had some great stuff so far , and have made a little list of things i like most , so when i run out i know what i liked . 
  i 'm definitely going to finish all of europe , and fill that rack with all of the flags . 
  so on to the next country !, 
  #spot taken ! # ( copypasta explanation below ) the idea is that i send you a package with goodies from my country ( netherlands ) to you , and you send one from yours to me !, 
  i 've made this a monthly thing , in where every month i 'll pick a country at random . 
  this way , except for only consuming good stuff , i 'd like to learn a bit more about your daily life in other countries , since i 'm really interested in european culture . 
  examples of things i 'd like to try : - cookies typical to your country - sweets - dried sausages and/or cheese ( no smelly cheese france ! ), 
  - things you put on your bread - local spirits/liquors - i like pretty much anything , so send me whatever you 'd like me to try !, 
  examples of things i 'll send you : - hagelslag - stroopwafels - sweets - if you 'd like , a regional spirit/liquor - cheese of course - anything local by request !, 
  do keep in mind though , that the stuff has to survive an average of 7 days of travel , so do n't send stuff that goes bad quickly . 
  and also , i 'm working on a flag collection , so if you could send me your countries flag ( preferably 1m x 1.5 m ) , i 'll send you one of mine as well !, 
  i 'm thinking of a price range of around $ 20 , or your local heathen equivalent , excluding shipping and the flag . 
  if you 'd like a different one , we can discuss that through pm of course .

  thanks u/haenep !, 
  i 'll keep track of the countries i 've had through colouring [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/33shroq ) map , sou you can keep track of it as well .

  good day r/europe !, 
  it 's time for another exchange . 
  so far i 've had a lot of good stuff sent to me , and i 've only heard good things from the recipents . 
  in case you missed an exhange in december , do n't worry . 
  there was no exchange . 
  due to some long shipping times , and this december being a very expensive month for me , i was unable to do an exchange . 
  we 'll continue as usual this month , but i 'll be taking just one exchangee this month . 
  alright , let 's get started !, 
  ( copypasta explanation below ) the idea is that i send you a package with goodies from my country ( netherlands ) to you , and you send one from yours to me !, 
  i 'm looking for one , maybe two people willing to exchange something with me .
