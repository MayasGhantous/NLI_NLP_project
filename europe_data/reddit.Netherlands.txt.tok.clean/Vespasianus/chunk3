  you needed a pass just to walk around the corridors . 
  your parents needed to come and pick you up if you were ill or needed to leave . 
  * there is usually a fully trained nurse at the school . 
  she takes your temperature regardless of what you are complaining of . 
  i was sent back to class with a headache because i had no fever . 
  i had asked for a paracetamol , and was refused ( `` you need a note from a doctor for that ! '' ), 
  * i had the same schedule every day , 8h to 16h with only one half hour break . 
  * all students are lumped together in one school regardless of ability or eventual plans after graduation . 
  * there was no geography and very little history aside from american history . 
  * schools funnel massive amounts of money into bizarre ` school pride ' rallies and those in-school sport clubs we always see on tv . 
  * sex and drug education is appalling . 
  there was no sex education , and the 6 months of drug education can only be described by repeating `` drug x will kill you '' ad infinitum . 
  * there was a free bus that picked you up and dropped you off from home/school . 
  * the cafeteria was like a mini restaurant within the school . 
  there were very few healthy items to be had . 
  very few students brought lunch from home . 
  also , americans will eat 3 hot meals a day every day which i found utterly bizarre . 
  if you 're curious , i can provide more examples . 
  also , it should be noted that this school was voted one of the best in the state and was situated in a rather wealthy suburb of a relatively large city . 
  it was n't some backwards farm village . 
  they 're probably using the list of countries participating in next year 's eurovision contest . 
  i disagree with his critique of our educational system . 
  it 's hierarchical but all based on what you want to do . 
  naturally , if you want to do medicine , you should have to sit the highest level ( vwo ) and pass your exams with high marks . 
  that 's the set-up in almost every country . 
  there 's a lot of upward-downward mobility in the educational system too . 
  just because you graduated at one level does n't mean you have to stick with that level when you go on to university . 
  when i did a year in the states ( where schools are not tiered ) i found it extremely distracting to be in the same class as students who did n't want to be there , or who had lower aptitude or interest in a certain subject , but were forced to be there anyway . 
  this seemed to foster a lot of resentment and those students provided a major distraction for both the teacher and the other students . 
  the issue is not nearly as black and white as that . 
  he 's quoting something from 4chan that was on the front page recently . 
   `` our sacrifice does n't stop here !, 
  we are planning to spend our next holiday in spain . 
  other impoverished countries have made the list as well ... all of them coincidentally in the mediterranean or carribean . '', 
  hans falschmann , fake german minister, 
  the netherlands and , to a lesser extent , other parts of the continent also have english language courses ranging from bachelor 's to phd programmes at various universities . 
  there is a silent minority for strict gun control but any time it 's brought up someone mentions that in some 200 + year old document it says everyone should can have guns , end of discussion . 
  people give `` freedom to carry deadly weapons '' the same standing as something like `` freedom of speech . '', 
  the running ` logic ' is that everyone owning guns prevents crime . 
  i 'm currently living in the states . 
  not the crazy cowboy bits either , mind . 
  i live in liberal boston . 
  i refuse to argue about guns with people anymore . 
  i can quote gun death statistics et cetera all i like but people are utterly convinced , it seems , that george iii is going to come back any day now and take back his colonies . 
  the truth of the matter is that a lot of my fear/dislike of guns stems from societal norms and how i was brought up . 
  so no matter how often they argue `` you just have to learn how to use a gun and all will be fine , '' i ca n't bring myself to get into that mentality ( though i have gone to a shooting range and hated it ) . 
  hm ... as long as we 're critiquing each other 's english : ** learnt * ** spelt * now it 's my time to ~ ~ be pedantic ~ ~ shine !, 
  most european countries have some version of american idol now . 
  eurovision is mostly for entertaining acts . 
  in the days of old it used to contain genuine talent and good ( or at least better ) music . 
  these days it 's something everyone loves to hate . 
  my biggest complaint is n't the rubbish music but the fact that it 's all in english . 
  after the early 90 's there have been only a few non-english songs . 
  well , this gay western european found it dreadful . 
  i propose a chicken . 
  it works on so many levels !, 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/og0jh.jpg ) is our past . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8hzjr.jpg ) is the present . 
  and finally , our ( possible ) [ future ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lgjyw.jpg ) . 
  my ( french ) half brother did an exchange to poland . 
  at dinner with his host family someone said , `` look !, 
  i found a french flag ! '', 
  then proceeded to wave about a white cloth napkin . 
  my humourless twatty brother just scowled . 
  i found it hilarious and received a scowl in turn for my laughter ( which was mostly schadenfreude at his expense ) . 
  thanks to amsterdam 's reputation i ca n't go anywhere in europe without people trying to buy weed from me . 
  because [ football ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf_uogybk1c ) . 
  i would like to add that holland is not poland . 
  and the netherlands are not where peter pan lives . 
  in other news , the italian government has demanded the return of all roman artifacts throughout europe . 
  not for any sort of cultural purpose , but to lower the cost of building the [ romaland ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/27/roman-theme-park-romaland_n_1458614.html ) theme park . 
  i obviously did n't mean it this way . 
  under this logic newfoundland is n't part of north america . 
  brilliant attitude . 
  i 've met so many brits who assert that the uk is separate from the rest of europe . 
  it 's refreshing to see this . 
  but how many of your compatriots do you think would agree with you ? 
  i suppose i 'm not the only one who enjoys that aspect of france/spain/italy . 
  i 've learnt quite a bit of spanish and italian just by travelling through the two countries . 
  tja ... 
  they 're just jealous of our superior football prowess . 
  i 've heard differently on the topic of basque genetics . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20443121 ) for example . 
  i also was more interested in genetic drift between castilian/catalonian spanyards and spanyards from parts more recently conquered from the moors et al than anything else . 
  it 's a shame there 's no berber datapoint . 
  i would be fascinated to see a datapoint from the basque region . 
  i wonder far away from the spanish and french data points it would be . 
  in addition i would personally like to see : * 2 more datapoints from france ( from near brittany and near paris ) * two from italy ( lombardia and sicily ) * two from spain ( near andalusia and one from the aforementioned basque region ) and * one datapoint in scotland just for the sake of curiosity . 
  interesting point ... 
  the eu parliament does have legitimacy issues . 
  i personally feel it represents the spirit of the eu which is `` no no no , * this * should be * here * , '' resulting in the whole bloody moving circus we have that * technically * meets in strasbourg but is administered in luxembourg whilst everyone is usually in brussels . 
  it should be several birds fighting over a single worm . 
  edit : whilst there are several other viable worms at their feet . 
  my favourite cities in the netherlands would be utrecht , den bosch , delft and nijmegen . 
  my recommendation : try and be in the southern netherlands ( e.g. 
  that 's when we celebrate carnaval . 
  additionally if you happen to be near in the spring , we celebrate queen 's day on 30 april . 
  this is , imho , the most fun holiday in the country . 
  * ( hope that was correct ... ), 
  personally , i wish that countries would sing in their native tongues more often .
