nope , totally unrelated . 
  oss is a town in the southern province of north-brabant , osdorp used to be an independent town but was annexed by amsterdam in the first half of the 20th century . 
  in the general area around `` murderers and socialists '' oss , which is now still part of catholic carnival country . 
  okay , you got me on a technicality . 
  highest point of the contiguous netherlands , then . 
   follow-up . 
  owes much of its growth and image as a high-tech city to the [ philips company ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philips_n.v . 
  ) , even though they moved their headquarters to amsterdam in the late nineties . 
  * ** politicians and hooligans ** : the hague . 
  home of both the dutch government and the football club ado den haag , which tends to have some crowd control issues on match days ( although it 's not half as bad as it used to be ) . 
  the violent core has a longstanding rivalry with ajax amsterdam , who in turn care more about their rivalry with feyenoord rotterdam . 
  * ** posh and pompous ** : [ gooi area ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gooi ) . 
  situated between amsterdam and hilversum ( the country 's main broadcasting centre ) , het gooi is the home of the rich and famous . 
  decadent , opulent and affluent , and rather keen to show it . 
  the villas are nice , though . 
  * ** sadistic wet bastard ** : north sea . 
  great for international trade , awful for keeping your feet dry . 
  most popular local phrase to express unbridled enthousiasm for a specific event : `` could be worse . '', 
  strong dislike of friesland , a feeling that is entirely mutual . 
  * ** streams ( and farmers ) ** : salland . 
  had to look this one up , no one cares about salland . 
  but apparently they have a lot of waterways and such . 
  so yeah , streams . 
  must be nice for cycling or something . 
  * ** stubborn blond speedskaters ** : friesland/frisia . 
  probably the first province to secede from the rest . 
  strong regional identity , incomprehensible dialect which is pretty close to english . 
  when they 're not speedskating , they are [ sailing in a sk\u00fbtsje ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sk%c3%bbtsje ) . 
  when they 're not sailing in a sk\u00fbtsje , they are [ jumping over a ditch using a pole five times their body size by sticking it in the ditch and climbing to the top hoping they reach the other side in time ] ( http://i.imgur.com/88bpg1u.gif ) . 
  * ** suicidal kids ** : west friesland . 
  not a part of friesland , oddly enough . 
  no significant industry , no higher education , lots of drug use and one of the highest youth suicide rates in the country . 
  * ** too far away for any practical purposes ** : city of groningen . 
  the only university town in the entire north . 
  generally considered to be quite nice , but a two and a half hour drive from the main metropolitan areas and therefore off the radar . 
  * ** too poor to live in amsterdam ** : [ almere ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/almere ) . 
  commuter town for the capital . 
  built in the seventies and eighties , and it 's showing . 
  * ** train delay central ** : utrecht . 
  great place once you look past the train station and the adjacent shopping mall , but also a crucial railway hub for the country . 
  if something train-related breaks down here , you 'll notice it all the way to south limburg . 
  * ** wait , people live here ? 
  back when the dutch called themselves the [ republic of the seven united netherlands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_republic ) , drenthe was actually province number eight . 
  since they were dirt poor , however , no one bothered to count them in ( or give them voting rights in the senate , for that matter ) . 
  great place for a compulsory holiday with your parents . 
  they 've got [ ancient rocks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dolmen ) , and ... yeah , no , that 's it . 
  they 've got rocks . 
  oh , and a [ nazi camp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/westerbork_transit_camp ) . 
  so they 've got that going for them , which is nice . 
  * ** why did we drain this area again ? 
  flat area , also drained in the early 20th century , and the closest we managed to get to a flat [ simcity model ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/2013-noordoostpolder.jpg ) . 
  we sprawled some villages here and there on the flat soil and hoped that it would amount to something , but it really does n't . 
  did i mention how flat it is ? 
  * ** woodland , wildlife and bike lanes ** : [ veluwe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veluwe ) . 
  the largest national park of the netherlands , and the only place where you genuinely can get lost in the woods . 
  you know , until you stumble upon one of the numerous bike paths used to get across the car-free zone , like , ten minutes after you got lost . 
  has more camp sites and bungalow parks than the entire country of switzerland . 
  we like our [ caravans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/travel_trailer ) , man . 
  * ** you 're ours now , bitch !, 
  ** : [ ijsselmeer/lake yssel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ijsselmeer ) . 
  used to be an open sea , complete with tides and salt water and shit . 
  then we decided we did n't like it , built a [ dike around it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afsluitdijk ) , and started waterskiing on its face . 
  i agree ( currently living there ) , but i do n't think most dutchmen understand the significance of the city . 
  also , i tried to explain every stereotype in the comments of the original post . 
  quoting myself :  inspired by the [ new jersey map ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/2ejc8m/map_of_new_jersey_stereotypes_924_x_1600/ ) , and used as a fun exercise in both mapmaking and summing up my own knowledge of my home country . 
  obviously this is no hard science ( or whatever form of science , for that matter ) , but , you know , it 's a map . 
  maps are cool . 
  * ** annexed by germany ** : north sea beach . 
  ze krauts have got their own beaches , but apparently ours are nicer . 
  we do n't mind them , but they do have the funny tendency to dig holes in the sand to mark their territory . 
  still an improvement over their previous methods . 
  the most well-known seaside town is [ scheveningen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scheveningen ) , which is coincidentally a nice shibboleth to determine [ whether someone is dutch or german ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_shibboleths#dutch.e2.80.93german ) . 
  * ** arrogant schmucks ( and ignorant tourists ) ** : amsterdam . 
  loud , obnoxious , and claiming to be the center of the universe ( also known as `` almost every capital city ever '' ) . 
  we generally like tourists , apart from those who do n't see the differences between sidewalk and bike path , and those who think the netherlands consists of amsterdam and some windmills and tulip fields . 
  * ** at least we 've got a naval base ** : [ den helder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/den_helder ) . 
  hometown of the dutch navy , which makes it sound way more spectacular than it is . 
  seriously , do n't bother going to den helder . 
  except for boarding the ferry to texel . 
  * ** backyard to the big cities ** : [ groene hart/green heart ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groene_hart ) . 
  thinly populated , rural , and completely surrounded by cities like rotterdam , the hague and utrecht . 
  filled with lakes , small rivers and marshes , and therefore ideal for all kinds of recreational activities . 
  if we 'd make an effort and fill it up with housing projects , we could create a metropolitan region that outranks the san francisco bay area . 
  however , since most people like it the way it is , we now have a nice soggy backyard with no industry of significance . 
  * ** beach holiday territory ** : [ waddeneilanden/west frisian islands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_frisian_islands ) . 
  less germans , so more room on the beach for us . 
  great place for cycling and camping , as long as the wind blows in the right direction and you know how to properly set up a tent . 
  * ** better off as an island ** : urk . 
  used to be an actual island , and still is for all intents and purposes . 
  very religious . 
  very conservative . 
  close community . 
  lots of fish . 
  * ** bible belt ** : [ what it says on the tin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bijbelgordel ) . 
  conservative protestants all the way from zeeland to drenthe . 
  first place to aim your frustration at during measles outbreaks , because of their dislike for state-run vaccination programs . 
  * ** broke commies ** : east groningen . 
  the only area where the [ communist party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_communist_party_of_the_netherlands ) still has some foothold . 
  also the poorest region of the entire country . 
  no industry , no tourism , and nothing to do but emigrate to germany .
