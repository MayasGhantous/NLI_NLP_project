  * ** catholic carnival country ** : north brabant . 
  also known as the area `` below the rivers '' . 
  apart from limburg the only province with a catholic majority , known for their `` burgundic '' behaviour ( i.e. 
  bon vivants , who enjoy their beer and their festivities . ), 
  [ local dialect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brabantian_dialect ) that approaches flemish . 
  * ** cheeseheads ** : north holland / [ zaan district ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaanstreek#the_zaan_district ) . 
  together with south holland the only area that actually warrants the ethnic slur . 
  very industrious ever since the [ dutch golden age ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_golden_age ) . 
  * ** corrupt unintelligible backup-belgians ** : limburg . 
  experts in cronyism , nepotism and [ pastry ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vlaai ) . 
  the jury is still out on whether the limburgers or the frisians are the most unintelligible people , but at least the frisians are honest about it and admit they 're speaking [ a different language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_frisian_language ) . 
  * ** flat and dull ** : [ flevoland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flevoland ) . 
  reclaimed from the sea in the early fifties . 
  [ the project itself ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zuiderzee_works ) was spectacular , the end result less so . 
  flat , empty and windy . 
  so we crammed some [ windmills ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=windmolens+flevoland&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=x539u9nshcrepduigoak&amp;ved=0cd0qsaq&amp;biw=1537&amp;bih=815 ) into the area , and now everybody is happy . 
  * ** frat boy city ** : leiden . 
  this one gets a bit lost in translation . 
  americans have frat boys , we have [ `` corpsballen '' ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=windmolens+flevoland&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=x539u9nshcrepduigoak&amp;ved=0cd0qsaq&amp;biw=1537&amp;bih=815#q=corpsballen&amp;safe=off&amp;search_plus_one=form&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  the hazing and the beer consumption is still there , though . 
  they can be found in any university town , it 's just that [ leiden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leiden_university ) has no other significant claim to fame . 
  * ** friendly neighbours ( and farmers ) ** : [ twente ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twente ) . 
  home to agriculture , the [ grolsch beer brewery ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grolsch_brewery ) and the concept of [ `` noaberskop '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twente#traditions ) . 
  * ** frugal and first to drown ** : [ zeeland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zeeland ) . 
  putting the `` new '' in `` new zealand '' since 1645 . 
  industrious and sober people . 
  used to be the first potential victim to being swallowed by the sea . 
  after that [ actually happened ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_sea_flood_of_1953 ) , they decided to [ build some world-famous dams ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delta_works ) , and now they 're pretty much safe . 
  good on ya , zeeland !, 
  * ** fruit pickers ** : [ betuwe/rivierenland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betuwe ) . 
  lots of rivers , plenty of fertile ground for fruit orchards . 
  at some point they decided they needed a mascot , so they came up with a [ young boy with a body made out of berries ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?safe=off&amp;hl=nl&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1537&amp;bih=815&amp;q=flipje+van+tiel&amp;search_plus_one=form&amp;oq=flipje+van+tiel&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24l3.879.2755.0.3027.15.7.0.8.8.0.112.600.6j1.7.0....0...1ac.1.52.img..0.15.654.ioyynjq-qay&amp;gws_rd=ssl ) . 
  * ** greenhouses everywhere ** : [ westland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/westland,_municipality_of_the_netherlands ) . 
  seriously , [ not kidding ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n793hnr.jpg ) . 
  incredibly tight-knit fishing community , known for their [ traditional clothing ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:costumes-maroesjka-heeze-1989.jpg ) . 
  for some reason responsible for half of dutch pop music production . 
  in dutch known as `` havana aan de waal '' ( havana-upon-waal ) , after the river on which it is situated . 
  politically left-leaning ever since the sixties and seventies . 
  * ** look , we 've got mountains ** : south limburg . 
  proud owner of the [ vaalserberg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaalserberg ) , at 322m ( 1059 ft ) the highest point of the netherlands . 
  too bad we have to share it with both belgium and germany . 
  * ** motocross ( and farmers ) ** : [ achterhoek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/achterhoek ) . 
  rural area , home of the [ zwarte cross ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwarte_cross ) and other mud-related activities . 
  used to have a nice traditional city center , then we had [ some germans over and the whole thing got a bit out of hand ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotterdam_blitz ) and now it 's mostly post-war highrise . 
  has the highest percentage of foreigners from non-industrialised nations , one of whom made it to the [ mayor 's office ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ahmed_aboutaleb ) . 
  * ** murderers and socialists ** : oss . 
  in the early 20th century infamous because of the brutal killings by the [ oss gang ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/bende_van_oss ) , now mostly known as the hometown of [ jan marijnissen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_marijnissen ) , chairman of the dutch socialist party . 
  which is not half as spectacular as the whole murder thing , but the local tourist office probably prefers it this way . 
  capital of the province of friesland , but they do n't speak the same [ language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stadsfries_dialects ) and they do n't support the same [ football club ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambuur_leeuwarden ) , so no one in friesland takes them seriously . 
  well , they are part of the [ council of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ) . 
  geographically , sure , that 's asia , but there are definitely political and geographical ties to europe in the caucasus . 
  as true as that might be , it 's hard to find good-looking pictures in high resolution for most of them . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3w24i7/the_fancy_halls_of_the_legislative_chambers_of/ ) for the previous post , which focused on the legislative chambers within these buildings . 
  within europe , only san marino , liechtenstein and monaco ( and vatican city , if you want to be specific ) have a lower population-per-seat rate . 
  see the eighth column [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_legislatures_by_country ) for more info . 
  the building is even weirder from [ the outside . ], 
  ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/landtag_liechtenstein_3.jpg ), 
  because i think the scottish parliament looks awesome - i added wales and northern ireland for fairness sake . 
  no political reasoning , purely aesthetics , 
  two lines down : `` he is regarded as national poet in poland , lithuania and belarus . '', 
  like i said , national identity is tricky . 
  whoops , that should be the other way around . 
  the [ pantheon 1.0 dataset ] ( http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/treemap/country_exports/ca/all/-4000/2010/h15/pantheon ) maps `` historical cultural production '' by collecting , visualizing and analyzing data from the biographies of historically , culturally and/or politically significant figures worldwide . 
  [ see here ] ( http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/methods ) for more info about their methods . 
  although this map is largely created by listing the first name in every country ( see ranking  people  parameter : birth country ) , the dataset currently only takes into account the birthplace of these figures -- without regard for where they achieved their fame in life or whether the country to which they 're affiliated even existed in some form or another at the time . 
  as such , there is some personal interpretation involved . 
  for instance , charlemagne would be first on the list for belgium , but i opted to leave him out because a. there is a certain amount of uncertainty regarding his place of birth , and b. he is not associated with what we currently see as belgium or its direct predecessors , such as the austrian or spanish netherlands . 
  another example would be immanuel kant , who is listed no . 
  1 for russia because he was born in current-day kaliningrad . 
  however , for all intents and purposes kant is most often seen as german , not russian , so he is bumped off the ranking in favour of no . 
  as a final example : both lewis milestone and emil constantinescu were born in moldova , but moved abroad at a young age and were therefore excluded . 
  vincent van gogh , however , only moved to france later in life and is to this day closely associated with the netherlands , so he remains no . 
  1 for the dutch . 
  obviously , nationality and identity have always been controversial subjects , and there is no way to ever create a map like this in a way that comes anywhere near objectivity . 
  the intention of this map is not to provoke or to antagonize , merely to entertain . 
  * [ abork abork ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/the_swedish_chef.jpg ), 
  after [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5f4hsh/a_map_of_the_netherlands_with_cities_and/ ) , a few people remarked that they would like to see a similar version of other countries . 
  so here 's belgium , our affable southern neighbour . 
  there 's always the issue of how far you want to go with etymology . 
  `` dam at the amstel river '' explains where amsterdam got its name , but not what amstel means ( `` water area '' , how boring ) . 
  with friesland , i thought it would be more meaningful to refer to the origin of the word `` friezen '' , which according to the most popular theory is actually based on an old term for `` the free ( men ) '' . 
  check the map again , 
  it 's actually hellendoorn , not hellendoom . 
  and it 's derived from the term `` holendere '' , which refers to the sambucus tree ( known for growing elderberries ) . 
  just for accuracy 's sake - boston would be shown on the map as `` saint botolph 's town '' ( with an asterisk , because there 's discussion about whether '' - ton '' refers to `` town '' , `` stone '' or `` tun '' ( hamlet ) . 
  well no , boston would be translated as `` saint botolph 's town '' ( or `` stone '' or `` hamlet '' , so an asterisk would be in order ) . 
  that 's the way these translations are structured - i did n't make anything up . 
  if anything , it just goes to show how far removed current-day placenames are from their origins . 
  thanks , very much appreciated . 
  and you 're right , this could easily be expanded into a whole range of different countries . 
  unfortunately , there are only so many languages in which i can do some proper research , 
  what he says ^, 
  no , it does n't . 
  but the original meaning of leiden ( or `` leithon '' ) [ does ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/leiden#naamgeving ), 
  you 're right , it 's not exactly the same . 
  i chose to use the same format for the reddit title , but i hope the title within the image brings across the point of the map accurately enough . 
  they 're not entirely acurate if you take the present-day translation for every name . 
  but from a [ toponymical ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toponymy ) point of view , they most definitely are . 
  a `` suol '' in medieval dutch was indeed a hill , but more specifically a higher , dryer and thus more habitable area ( in the case of zwolle a sand ridge or ` dekzandrug ' in dutch ) surrounded by a marsh area . 
  at the time - we 're talking early medieval era - zwolle was definitely surrounded by the marshes of what we now know as the ijssel and the overijsselse vecht .
