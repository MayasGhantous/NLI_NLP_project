europe , ** fuck off ** , those are my pimples !, 
  that got to the point quickly enough . 
  literally clicked this thread because i saw ` apartheid ' and i 'm south african . 
  not that that has anything to do with it . 
  however , how about having two separate buses , but instead of splitting it between italians and roma , people who litter , spit , start fights or cause trouble , get tagged . 
  i do n't know what is used to pay for bus fares but if it 's an electronic chip card or some other form of ticketing there could possibly be a way to tag individuals who are abusing the system and make them use the other bus . 
  that being said implementing that is a rather large mission . 
  but discriminating an entire group of people is also wrong ... 
  i am still ** an ** idiot mr president . . 
  south african / dutch here . 
  proud that both your options are my nationalities :d * does dance *, 
  [ something tells me this tram has a long journey ahead of it ... ] ( http://imgur.com/a/fgwgx#58 ), 
  jokes should hardly be made at him , someone else booked the ticket . 
  it 's their fault ...  the flight booking was made by someone within the education , sport and culture department , according to the bbc , and pallett was n't aware he was going to the wrong capital city until it was all too late . 
  how do you get your google maps to display native names of countries as well as in english ? 
  ol' willy is part kraut !? 
  most headlines have just dissolved into clickbait , but every now and then a gem like this one comes along and you just sit there like '' * how in the fuck ... * '' with a stupid smile on your face , * waiting * to see how the article turns out ... 
  wow . 
  bulgarians have their shit * way * more together than the dutch do ... 
  they seem much more knowledgeable on events . 
  did you read all of the comment ? 
  which comes with it 's ups and downs . 
  i find that there always seems to be a large and vocal dutch community somewhere in comment sections all across the internet and we 're often mentioned in articles , making us fairly relavent in world affairs . 
  there 's also more people which helps when finding products or people to talk to abroad . 
  but at the same time , cramming all those people into such a tiny space has it 's downsides . 
  while i would n't say i ever feel * cramped * there is one aspect that 's inescapable in the netherlands . 
  * everything * is developed . 
  it 's nothing but towns and cities , then miles of cultivated , immaculate farmland and then another town or city . 
  there is no wild or natural areas left except for a tiny handful of nature reserves . 
  but on the whole you could be dropped anywhere in the netherlands without a map or a compass or a phone and you 'd get * unlost * within no more than two hours . 
  because you 'd probably just be on some farm and then all you need to do is keep walking until you find a fence and follow that until you find a farm house or gate leading to a road . 
  especially as i come from a fairly sparsely populated country with large tracts of uninhabited land , it 's a really surreal feeling taking a long train trip here and every time you look up all you see is civilisation . 
  almost every inch of the whole country is under the complete and utter dominion of man . 
  it 's unbelievable . 
  if anyone has a list of some good dutch podcasts , i 'd love to know . 
  i really want to improve my skills in dutch comprehension . 
  and while it 's not in europe , if anyone has some good persian podcasts that is n't chaiandconversation , i 'd love to hear about those too ... 
  if you go to google maps , switch on terrain or earth mode or whatever it 's called , and then zoom all the way out , it gives an accurate map of where the sun is hitting the earth . 
  and the bits currently experiencing night , you can see the light pollution . 
  that 's because denmark is into tiny .

  missiles fired . 
  romanian , czech republic , portugal ? 
  i 'm kind of on the fence with this one . 
  i 'm 50 % dutch and 50 % south african . 
  born in raised in the latter and now living in the former . 
  so already i feel torn . 
  on top of that i do n't 100 % identify with either culture . 
  as a lover of geography and languages and such , i spend a lot of time looking and learning about other places and people and all i see is all sorts of attributes from people everywhere that i identify with more than my supposed `` own culture '' that i was just handed because i happened to be born there and happened to have a parent who was of another nationality because his parents were born somewhere else . 
  and then we get the `` rut '' problem . 
  where people get into a `` rut '' because of things they 're `` supposed '' to be like or act like . 
  i lived in england for a year and on multiple occasions heard people commened something , then find out it was welsh ( for example ) and scoff and mouth off the welsh . 
  upon asking , their only answer as to `` why '' is because , `` well , we 're english . '', 
  nationality is such an odd concept . 
  cultures and traditions are so fluid . 
  areas move and expand . 
  what was the heart of germany only a short while ago is now northern poland . 
  on top of that things vary even inside nations . 
  traditions that some of my friends in limburg ( the deep south of the netherlands ) i 've found contrast significantly to those of the randstand ( the western hub of the netherlands ) including what was previous thought as a very * dutch * way of celebrating christmas , where gifts are given earlier in december . 
  yet right here , two of my dutch friends were debating which was the proper way : earlier in december , or on christmas itself . 
  i think rather than stick to some culture you 're handed , one should look into themselves , look at everyone around them and isolated the values they think portray them best and then mould that into your individual character . 
  that 's way more important to me than any idea of nationalism . 
  however the genocide was done to make sure the new turkish state had a better claim on areas that were previously controlled by armenian and seen as `` armenia '' the nation , not the ethnicity . 
  so in a way , because it was done against the people who once controlled that so turkey could reclaim their stake on the land , it kind of still makes sense to call it the `` armenian genocide . '', 
  more info on why turkey still does n't acknowledge the genocide : https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/4g8blc/the_armenian_genocide_why_is_the_current/, 
  ** the netherlands ** among other things we had a turkish/dutch journalist who got herself locked up in turkey after insulting supreme leader erdo\u011fan . 
   winland i 've literally never heard about finland losing anything . 
  it 's always about them dominating into sports or the winter war , among other ( usually more social ) victories . 
  wait , how are they alphabetical ? 
  germany -  austria -  belgium is n't alphabetical . 
  and neither is belgium -  austria -  germany . 
  [ if some people get their way . 
  i was like , `` ah yeah , the spaced the netherlands and luxembourg out by one flag . 
  that makes sense , they look very similar . 
  oh yeah , they did it for germany and belgium too ... '' and then i go see italy and ireland . 
  i 've heard a lot about eastern europeans `` driving down the wages '' as they 'll accept the same jobs for less money , because it 's still better money than they might be earning back home . 
  but if the minimum wage is set by the government , surely there 's a cap ? 
  i mean , they ca n't accept jobs for less than minimum wage because is n't it illegal to pay someone less than that ? 
  if anyone is interested , i 've made a subreddit dedicated to content like this : / r/photosofyesteryear it 's still very much under construction . 
  but hopefully it can be a place where we can get a window into the world of the past .

  i 'm sorry , i do n't understand you , it 's a little ambiguous . 
  are you saying that in the nordic countries and the netherlands you ca n't be charged for statutory rape if you have sex with someone your own age , someone older that you ( in that 15-16 example ) or that the laws for women not being charged are different ? 
  how come the mountains of norway/sweden have no street view but the ardennes , dolomites , alps and pyrenees do ? 
  odd . 
  i lived in cape town for the first eighteen years of my life , constantly having the atlantic curving out in a big , blue bulge ahead of me and the giant one kilometre high mesa of table mountain shooting up into my vision constantly making me aware of my direction , then i moved to the eastern edge of the netherlands last year and frankly have no withdrawal symptoms what-so-ever ... 
  i 'd like to state here that i am actually a dual national and have only been in the netherlands for the past four months so allllll of these politics i have had no say in . 
  i 'm with you though , a lot of the dutch are stuck up prissy western europeans imagining anything further east than austria being ravaging hordes coming to take their jobs and women and bring crime and poverty . 
  i thought you were referring to a certain comic . 
  although , now that i think of it i 'm not sure portugal and romania were grouped together ... 
  considering the large amount of romanian 's in my town , i thought the netherlands would be higher up on the list ... 
  could you give me a tl ; dr on usenet ? 
  yup . 
  i study near the border and it 's weird . 
  popcorn time is used by nearly every student in the netherlands and by german students while they 're here for uni but at home never do , having to come across the border to watch certain things . 
  yes , although it 's easier for dutch people to understand afrikaans than the other way around . 
  afrikaaners have a very soft , plain accent and standardized most of their grammar , getting rid of conjugation in many places . 
  which makes it hard fir them to underatand the more technical , grammatical dutch language . 
  there 's also many words that are entirely different .
