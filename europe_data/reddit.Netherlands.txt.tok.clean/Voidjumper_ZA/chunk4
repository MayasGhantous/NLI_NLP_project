  man that is weird for me ( south africa ) as you still have a few things after the ceremony and the actual certificate of given only the next year after the holidays so that kind of behaviour would land you in boatloads of hot trouble . 
  that 's why we just go full benelux . 
  we 're half a step away already . 
  zeelandic flanders is different from just saying `` flanders '' obviously saying just `` flanders '' any logical person is gon na think of the belgian area known as flanders , not a portion of zeeland . 
  sorry to break it to you but flanders is n't in the netherlands ... 
  bb do n't hurt me this way ... 
  heck off , we chose belgium first !, 
  thank you for your suggestions . 
  unfortunately i 've only been in the netherlands for a year and a half . 
  and i have never read any novels in dutch . 
  that 's why i was looking forward to suggestions ... 
  i was really hoping there would be some dutch books here :(, 
  considering i * am * parts of the world that speak england 's language \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  i wish i could give you two upvotes . 
  ssssh we know ur are in love eesti . 
  do not deny ur feelings . 
  to woo your sexy northern neighbour ? 
  ah yes . 
  that iydllic season back in 1915 ... where all was quiet and nothing at all happened ... 
  huh when i read the title the first time i was sure it did n't explicitly state europe but rather was just implied and therefore i could get away with it . 
  rats . 
  man it is so helpful to just babble . 
  often if i am where people might know both of my languages i just babble in something official sounding but nonsense and throw in mutilated words from it languages for added believability . 
  10/10 gets rid of hobos , randos and anyone else you do n't want taking to you ... 
  we have a zoo and it is all made up of chickens . 
  how did you get a canadian elected as prime minister who ca n't wish the language ? 
  sssh eesti , is okay . . have e-potato or a glass of tallinn 's # 1 attraction to calm down ... 
   * electing braindead governments i and the rest of south africa would like to challenge you on that one ... 
  if you were on / r/place : they completely empoldered armenian territory . 
  if you were n't : looooong story . 
  and if i only spoke dutch as a dutchman ? 
  yes !, 
  '' * my pen is in my hand . 
  * '' works both in english and in afrikaans for both spelling and meaning . 
  ** edit : ** hunted down that thread and saw a slight variation of this was in the comments there . 
  still , i learnt this in school once and think it 's okay to stay here . 
  south africa : apricot , then strawberry . 
   germany without german is possible , but impractical and often unpleasant . 
  i feel like the netherlands is one of the few countries you really can get by with only english . 
  i do n't live in a big city at all and my course is in english so i have a lot of friends who only speak their native language + english and almost every single person here can speak english to some degree and so far no one of them have had problems at all with living without dutch . 
  yeah , [ all sorts of things .

  could be a joke methinks, 
  it truly is a glorious time . 
  not sure about europe but in south africa the meme was that kfc 's ice cream machines were never working ( literally all the goodamn time what the fuck ) at different branches everywhere . 
  we never really had this problem with mcdonald 's . 
  although i 've seen now people attribute it to mccyd 's or even people i know have trashtalked kfc deny it was kfc and was mcdonald 's instead due to the sheer signal tsunami of american media . 
  i ca n't remember the last time i used cash . 
  could have been coming bsck from the uk i needed to get rid of some pound coins . 
  or my barber who only takes cash . 
  but otherwise almost everywhere in the netherlands i go with only a card . 
  from street florists to d\u00f6ner stands , markets to any shop under the sun , card machines are the quickest and easiest way to pay , especially as they exact and , i believe , have no extra fee on them . 
   additionally , `` hij/zij '' ( he/she ) used to be considered impolite . 
  the proper way used to be for example `` mister [ last name ] '' . 
  i remember being reprimanded by a teacher for saying `` hij '' when talking about another teacher at school . 
  nowadays it 's even common for state tv to use `` hij '' when talking about our king ... 
  this exists in english as well . 
  i remember being reprimanded often for using `` he/she '' with someone ( a teacher or a parent ) saying `` who 's she ? 
  the cat 's mother ? '', 
  i found this really odd as i never heard any practical example of someone saying the noun over and over . 
  that 's what pronouns are for . 
  example case : if i 'm standing in the kitchen with my mother and my friend . 
  my friend says , `` oh something smells like baking '' as a general remark . 
  if i answer , knowing my mother might just let it trail and say `` yes , she baked biscuits an hour ago '' it 's possible my mother would reprimand me and with `` she ? 
  who , the cat 's mother ? '', 
  i find that having to use `` my mother baked biscuits '' when we 're all informal and close and in the same room really awkward . 
  ` she ' does not seem that rude , and a somewhat obvious reference to the person in question . 
  the dutch wikipedia is the fourth largest version of wikipedia , behind other giant languages like german . 
  i think that disagrees with it slightly . 
  plus , all bookstores or libraries i 've been to have small english sections , but are mostly fulled with dutch-language works . 
  there is also the taalunie which works to promote the langauges through all sorts of events . 
  weird , i had a dutch guy also comment arguing that there were no other moons . 
  i 'm sorry , but you are incorrect : - [ the moons of jupiter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moons_of_jupiter ) - [ moons in our solar system ] ( https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/solarsystem/moons ) - [ list of natural sattelites ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_natural_satellites )  the solar system 's planets and officially recognized dwarf planets are known to be orbited by 182 natural satellites , or moons . 
  - [ table of moon discovery ] ( http://www.windows2universe.org/our_solar_system/moons_table.html ) - [ definition of moon ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/moon )  any planetary satellite, 
  in english natural satellites are known as moons . 
  - [ the moons of jupiter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moons_of_jupiter ) - [ moons in our solar system ] ( https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/solarsystem/moons ) - [ list of natural sattelites ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_natural_satellites )  the solar system 's planets and officially recognized dwarf planets are known to be orbited by 182 natural satellites , or moons . 
  - [ table of moon discovery ] ( http://www.windows2universe.org/our_solar_system/moons_table.html ) - [ definition of moon ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/moon )  any planetary satellite, 
  and in two hundred years when the rest of the moon is colonised and other moons to so ours becomes luna , it 's gon na look pretty silly . 
  nope , gogbot is the robot one , themed around technology and stuff , the other festivals have their own titles , 
  [ for official purposes ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/friesland#frysl.c3.a2n ), 
  i can vouch for this . 
  although enschede tries it 's hardest to always have something on . 
  especially in spring and summer , there 's some event in the centrum and around the main church happening what seems like every second weekend . 
  whether that 's robotics or international food or different cultures or sex . 
  so , i think they 're just cycling through different interests . 
  especially as the city is not particularly large , and has three teritary institutions all together , making students a huge portion of the population . 
  the events seems to be there to cater for that . 
  which is a smart move , imo . 
  yes , thank you . 
  never heard of the v4 before . . 
  uh ... v4 ? 
  oh god ... that black square ... 
  well , you 've got the stats to back it up ... mods ... get on this . . 
  caesar sounds fucking dope imo ... 
  weirdly , i knew two or three bjorns in south africa . 
  which is ... interesting ? 
  no but origin is , so maybe titanfall 2 shall be mine . 
  i mean , i know americans say `` february 5th '' but `` february the 5th '' does n't sound wrong . 
  in fact i 'm pretty sure i 'd say it instinctively . 
  in south africa ( as a native english speaker ) i would use `` the 1st of january '' formatting for all dates , even important ones like new years/christmas .
