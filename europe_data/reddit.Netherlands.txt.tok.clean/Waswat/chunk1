also , spain is a very western country so the sun goes down much later than in moldova for example . 
  that 's not because spain is a `` very western country '' though ... 
  it 's because you 're in the [ ` wrong ' ] ( http://puu.sh/safc0/cbd67c6e64.png ) timezone . 
  one hour later than the rest ... spain sunset is currently at [ 18:04 ] ( https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/spain/madrid ) , whereas much more west on the same line , at a relatively similar position in the timezone you 're supposed to be in , the sunset at toronto is at [ 17:00 ] ( https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/canada/toronto ) . 
  yet both have roughly the same daylight length ( ~ 10hrs ), 
   european  forced to shitpost on / r/the _ donald whyyyy ... 
  seen in in bihac , bosnia . 
  disc junkie ( xl ), 
  nothing much really . 
  unless you 're biking at a breakneck speed . 
  but , but , but ... :(, 
  nah , platypus has no wings bro . 
  they also said the buk system returned to russia after the attack . 
  there 's not much more to prove . 
  if it looks like a duck , swims like a duck , and quacks like a duck , then it probably is a duck . 
  eh , could be valid as something between [ rime riche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rime_riche ) and [ perfect rhyme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perfect_rhyme ), 
  i 've said it before , and i 'll say it again : `` but they did it too '' was never a valid argument . 
  not in kindergarten and certainly should n't be in real life . 
  yes , they both need to be investigated but we 're talking about russia here , if you want to talk about us war crimes , you can always make another thread rather than derail the current one . 
  yep , coalition forces have been asking for quite a while to stop the bombing of aleppo ; russias response ? 
  they veto the un demand to end bombing of aleppo together with the usual `` shifting the blame '' nonsense . 
  fair enough and i agree with your analysis there . 
  two-thirds it is !, 
   ans as i said , i do n't care about this , what bosnia needs is to stop caring so much about stupid ethnicity and counting every percent and just learn to live in peace like normal people . 
  but , knowing bosnians it 's not gon na happen for a while . 
  i agree , but considering we have a president for each ethnicity and considering what 's happening in bih rs at the moment with that whole referendum stuff , ethnicity is probably gon na be important for quite a while . 
   what ? 
  did you even read my comment . 
  do n't talk about what you do n't know about . 
  you edited the comment to talk about pre-war and far post-war census while i was typing . 
  that also does n't say much . 
  the bosniak population in bosnia have been known to have a faster growth rate than than serbs [ since before the war ] ( http://puu.sh/rcvir/425b0459f2.png ) . 
  and immediately after the war there were [ less bosniaks and croats but more serbs ] ( http://puu.sh/rcvr3/030660950c.png ) in the country which makes it extremely likely that far more bosniaks and croats fled the country . 
  we 're talking about people , not surface areas ( i mean , seriously , how can you say `` 50 % of the bosnian surface area dislikes serbs '' ) . 
  and we were generalizing anyway . 
  in the end it does n't matter , it was a joke that op now deleted . 
   serbs fled the war too , i have no idea what 's your point there . 
  these two sentences do n't make sense . 
  you know that far more bosniaks and croats left the country during war and you know that we were talking about the percentage of people . 
  stop faking ignorance . 
   only half of bosnia 75 % * that 's excluding the ones that fled from the war . 
   we have no reason to fake anything except faking content for higher viewership numbers ... 
   some satirically offered their own interpretations of fish and chips using aubergines , duck , beef and ravioli was my favorite, 
   fuck the british public . 
  was basically the only part that probably went too far in your example and that 's not the part most people say here . 
  it 's a forced addition that your mind came up with . 
  you might feel like the `` i feel sorry for them '' part is hollow but it definitely is also their way of saying `` i would n't want to be them right now '' or `` it sucks to be them right now '' . 
  if you want to be mad about that , then whatever dude . 
   and secondly , it 's infuriating when people who claim to feel sympathy for remain voters openly wish for our country to suffer as a consequence of voting to leave the eu . 
  people do n't seem to realise that sympathetic words ring hollow when accompanied by a desire to see us punished for the sins of our countrymen . 
  wtf ? 
  what do you expect the eu to do ? 
  fetch , roll over and play dead for britain ? 
  you expect the eu to let a country , that has reaped the benefits for so long , to still have those benefits without any consequences for leaving ? 
  you 're not that naive . 
  it would be extremely selfish of the brits ( including the ones who voted remain ) to want to still reap the benefits while having no consequences for leaving . 
  that would create an outcry in the rest of the eu . 
  it 's not like we can split your country in citizens who voted pro- and anti-eu and let only the anti-eu part leave . 
  i agree , it 's infuriating , yeah . 
  it sucks that you suffer the consequences of the uneducated masses when the morons in power let something as a referendum dictate a black and white choice , rather than a broad path . 
  but the british politicians and the eu ca n't just ignore that the majority voted to leave on a referendum . 
  so glad to see this here . 
  that explains it much better . 
  thank you for clarifying . 
  what a deplorable human being . 
   paris five-star hotel cleaner awarded $ 57,000 after being `` molested '' by qatari guest  the news in french clearly say sexually assaulted without trying to make it sound less serious than it was . 
   she was actually assaulted by the qatari guy . 
   what does sexually assaulted mean in a case like this ? 
  rape ? 
   article says he started assaulting her ( to rape her probably ) this is just confusing . 
  maybe it 's just my bosnian practicality kicking in but all i can think of is `` what a waste of good cinnamon '' ... 
  [ if israel can try ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israel%e2%80%93european_union_relations#eu_membership_for_israel ) , why not mexico . 
  difficult to compare . 
  i was born in bosnia and fled to the netherlands during the war . 
  people on the street think i 'm dutch because people see me and they see a white caucasian guy . 
  same probably applies to you . 
  it 's really easy to fit in when people think you 're from their country . 
  yeah , i agree that it should n't matter , but a lot of the time when people are growing up it does . 
  i think good parenting can fix the whole `` feeling like an outsider '' - part but that 's kind of rare . 
   you should also try to see the german turk point of view . 
  the younger generations have german passports and grow up bilingual , yet they learn from a young age , from both sides , german and turkish , that they are n't `` real '' germans . 
  yep , same problem happening in the netherlands . 
  even had a discussion about it with another dutch guy who flatout keeps referring to people who were born in nl with turkish parents as ` turken ' . 
  it 's tough to integrate in a country that keeps calling you an outsider . 
  the point was more towards the denial , especially in the first one where one person only said it was a mistake in an interview in 2015 . 
  thirty-two years after the fact . 
  by a news anchor , not the government . 
   in a 2015 interview igor kirillov , the senior soviet news anchor , said that he was initially given a printed tass report to announce over the news on september 1 , which included an `` open and honest '' admission that the plane was shot down by mistake ( a wrong judgement call by the far eastern air defence command ) . 
  however , at the moment the opening credits of the vremya evening news programme rolled in , an editor ran in and snatched the sheet of paper from his hand , handing him another tass report which was `` completely opposite '' to the first one and to the truth and  the soviet government expressed regret over the loss of life , but offered no apology and did not respond to demands for compensation . 
  instead , the ussr blamed the cia for this `` criminal , provocative act '' . 
  situation with the us and iran is very different ; there was much more transparency , they went to court with it and reached a settlement . 
  furthermore , you 're doing exactly as [ people expected a few posts up ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54vq6t/dutch_news_joint_investigative_team_confirms_that/d85cns0 ) . 
  `` x did it too '' was not a valid argument in kindergarten and it should n't be one in the world of grown-ups . 
   holland  1/10 . 
  triggered . 
  so you went back to eating [ fried pork blood ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_pudding ) ? 
  sounds like you never had kibbeling or vlaamse frieten  both superior to the fish & chips i had in the uk . 
  if we have both in superior form , nothing is lost . 
  also , your analogy implies that there 's work put into ` combining ' these two dishes when there is n't . 
  comparatively , fish and chips is just [ fried fish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kibbeling ) with [ fried potatoes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_fries ) .
