  both have been really popular in the netherlands for ages , yet brits like to claim [ the combination ] ( https://myshop.s3-external-3.amazonaws.com/shop4078800.pictures.fish-chips.jpg ) as [ original work ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0pxombl.png ) . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  [ russia has a history of shooting down commercial airliners and denying it . ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007 ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_902 ) i 'm just disgusted that these people are getting away with murder . 
   but given the average muslim lives in a very conservative society i think it seems likely . 
  fyi  the largest muslim population in a country is in indonesia , a nation home to 12.7 % of the world 's muslims , followed by pakistan ( 11.0 % ) , and india ( 10.9 % ) . 
  and not extremes like saudi arabia ( 1.6 % ) , which is what most people talk about when talking about killing or hating homosexuals . 
  though i 'd agree that these countries are conservative ( then again , i find the usa to be very conservative as well ) in india and pakistan same-sex sexual activities are illegal ( though not enforced in pakistan ) ; in indonesia it is legal . 
  3 different ways of thinking . 
  these same questions can be asked about islam though . 
  yep , from what i gather , for eurosceptics `` brussels '' often is symbolic and means something along the lines of `` the bureaucracy of ( and the bureaucrats tied to ) the european union/comission etc '' . 
  basically some kind of all-encompassing idea of what the european union does ` wrong ' eventhough bureaucracy in itself is n't inherently bad . 
  huh i 'm not sure why i made this response ; i was just waking up and now i totally lost my train of thought since then . 
  i probably did n't read what you said correctly or it was meant for someone else . 
  either way , i retract my statement . 
  it is not worthless , it shows the way some people think in a visual and often humorous manner . 
  ~ ~ even those were more centralist parties afaik . ~ ~, 
  and now you have lowered yourself to the other guys level . 
  245 , it went up !, 
  he 's from / r/t _ d so go figure . 
  1 hour to have the march get noticed , 1 hour to dispatch a reporter , an hour or two to have them take pictures and ask people for their thoughts , 1 hour for the reporter to go back , 1 hour to write things up and get it approved to publish ? 
  i think 6 hours is fair unless you are gon na do shit liveblog style . 
  d66 took some , they 're center right economically speaking but left progressive when it comes to culture & eu focused . 
  cu got some as well and they too have some progressive ideas ( climate change and pro freedom of religion ) ppl are saying that the left lost when in reality they voted for more progressive parties than pvda at the moment is . . interestingly pvda currently has the most 65 + voters . 
  it did . 
  its quite left leaning culturally speaking, 
   states are doing some fun stuff with voting systems though . 
  i think maine just adopted a runoff system for governor and possibly senator . 
  several states including my washington have `` jungle '' primaries where every candidate from every party competes and the two candidates regardless of party advance . 
  oh , it 's pretty cool that is still possible !, 
   constitutional amendment welp , considering how much americans love their constitution , i guess that 's never gon na happen then . 
  rip < o, 
  thanks , i 'll take your word for it !, 
  fixed . 
  unless vvd wants to work with pvv ( which they said they dont want to ) , they 're gon na be forced to work on their environment policy . 
  i never really had time to follow denk too much , i felt like they focused too much on the turkish bit and criticising news outlets . 
  haha , you might be correct ... [ but it 's ... more complicated than that , i suppose . 
  yeah , i 've seen americans respond to dutch political videos ( from groenlinks for example ) telling us ( in english ) to vote for pvv and telling us that the pvv is gon na be the biggest ; which made me quite annoyed personally . 
  that 's not how things work around here . 
  yes they were . 
  could be . 
  exit polls were pretty much spot on, 
  sure , [ here 's a graph ] ( https://puu.sh/uklf2/2f965dd4f2.png ) gl sp d66 pvda are left , denk is ~ ~ extreme left ( i suppose ? 
  ) ~ ~ center-left rest are either centrum right or extreme right . 
  winner in a region does n't really matter i suppose considering it 's for the national government . 
  nice bit from pechtold tbh . 
  lots of municipalities in limburg are voting pvv . 
  [ d66 wins in utrecht , groenlinks is second !, 
  ] ( https://puu.sh/ukkei/d9e7b87d99.png ) note that this is a big student city . 
  i do n't think you understand what brigading means ? 
  16 % of the votes , still impressive . 
  haha , hvala , 
  hahaha , i knew pvv was very unpopular among the younger voters but this is still pretty funny to see . 
  was it maybe gert-jan segers ? 
  i might have [ heard that before !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/lf2bou63lkw?t=525 ), 
  aaaand things changed again ; 4 coalition minimum . 
  haha damn , things are quick to change !, 
  let 's see what happens when 100 % of the votes are counted . 
  good on ya dude !, 
  they have only 1 seat though ... 
  lol they have no fucking clue how things happen around here :d, 
  sure i 'll translate some for ya ;  groenlinks jongens , dat is hem als je nog twijfelt groenlinks guys , that 's the one if you 're still in doubt  duurzame energie  ^ ^ ^ ^ ook ^ ^ ^ ^ al ^ ^ ^ ^ heb ^ ^ ^ ^ ik ^ ^ ^ ^ zelf ^ ^ ^ ^ d66 ^ ^ ^ ^ gestemd . 
  feels good to put it officially on paper !, 
  sadly could n't make a picture at the time but oh well . 
  i still have the list < 3 ( the picture you see is zoomed in picture of a list of every party and every person that you can vote on ; every household gets that to prepare )  die stemkaart was echt groot . 
  almost had to use the whole booth to open it   klopt !, 
  quite something to be proud of , so much choice   haha , inderdaad . 
  almost like a menu at a chinese restaurant  edit : some more :  groen links met de gemeenteraad gestemd . 
  i voted groenlinks during the council vote . 
  now pvda , my old party . 
  we 'll need the pvda as well . 
  after wilders is klaver the biggest populist on the list . 
  an obama imitator with a lack of honesty . 
  -- if you need anything else translated let me know !, 
  as far as more info : a lot of people thought he was a bit of a newbie , the new kid with no experience ; but for a lot of voters he shows our willingness to cooperate and is a sharp reaction towards the hateful and anti-eu rhetoric from the ` wrong ' kind of populists . 
  according to the exit polls they got 31 seats ... wich is a loss compared to 2012 , but they are still the biggest party . 
  it 's still very comparable . 
  edit : 33 seats now with 9 % of the votes counted, 
  by ferry , yes !, 
  it 's a [ project to restore the freshwater lakes and creating islands in the markermeer ] ( https://www.natuurmonumenten.nl/marker-wadden/english ) , you can visit it so it 's a nice way to do your civic duty while on a day off visiting the project . 
  you can vote outside of your district ( which is why some districts can get over 100 % representation ) . 
  but you need to [ get a kierzerpas for that . 
  you can vote in any , yes ... 
  there 's even one on an [ uninhabited island ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cuay9rh.jpg ) where people can go to [ by boat ] ( https://twitter.com/natuurmonument/status/842058363445903362/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw ) . 
  ~ 1300 people already voted [ there !, 
  ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/marker+wadden/@52.6098047,5.4316962,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb5477fd6bd45e4b1!8m2!3d52.6098047!4d5.4316962 ) to vote outside of your district you 'll need a kiezerspas though , which you can apply for . 
  people are even voting on a fucking [ uninhabited island ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cuay9rh.jpg ) !!, 
  [ 1300 people ] ( https://twitter.com/natuurmonument/status/842058363445903362/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw ) voted there thus far . 
  [ google earth link ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/marker+wadden/@52.6098047,5.4316962,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb5477fd6bd45e4b1!8m2!3d52.6098047!4d5.4316962 ), 
  yep , so it 's best to vote for the party you want rather than strategically, 
  actions speak louder than words , his votes show that he is pro-russia/holds pro-russia views . 
  he just is n't outspoken about it . 
  mouse over the flair , friend !, 
  these are not just any americans , they include [ publicists from fake news websites like breitbart ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/12/27/godfather-van-anti-islam-in-vs-steunpilaar-pvv-5937063-a1538592 ), 
  eh i always found the austrians to be the hill germans . 
  egotistical arrogance , i 'd wager . 
  same reason why he is n't showing up for debates . 
  the elasticity helps ... and even then , you can usually tie the rope around your middle if it is n't enough . 
  as far as rain goes , i find that a tracksuit dries pretty quickly but washing stains off of it is a problem , yes .
