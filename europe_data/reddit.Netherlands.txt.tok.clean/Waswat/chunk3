  well i guess there are perks to having no discernable culture . 
  well played . 
  huh , what a typical belgian-french comment . 
  \\* orders some delicious cevapcici * how 's the weather in zuid limburg ? 
  jeans and shirt is less comfortable than a tracksuit though . 
  also , tracksuits are warmer . 
  could be worse , could be erecting statues of [ people who commited warcrimes like genocide ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/mladic-memorial-plaque-placed-in-sarajevo ) , and [ ethnic cleansing ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-initiative-launched-for-milosevic-memorial-park ) . 
  thankfully the latter did n't happen , afaik . 
   only really begun mass immigration in the last decade longer than that . 
  they took in tons of ex-yugoslavs 25 years ago and iranian refugees before that . 
  how young/uninformed are you if you do not know this ? 
  oh man , can we please not turn this into a nostalgia sub ? 
   the remove kebab meme was created online and the meme does n't have to have the same meaning as the video it originates from that video ... 
  it has very fucking strong ties with serbia and the genocide in bosnia . 
  that it has spread to other places does n't change that . 
  it 's an insult disguised as a joke . 
  you do n't go around saying `` nigger '' to people and then tell them when they 're offended to `` chill out bro , it just means black person '' , do you ? 
  no , thats an oversimplification , the video - contains serb army soldiers - is a tribute to radovan karad\u017ei\u0107 ( yeah , the war criminal ) both are explained in the link i posted . 
  the memes say '' ** remove ** kebab '' ... the `` removal '' refers to ethnic cleansing of muslims ( in the case of the video , that 'd be bosniaks ) . 
  the lyrics include `` karadzic will lead the serbs '' and `` be afraid , ( croatian ) fascists and turks '' , implying the croatians are the fascist and the bosniaks are turks . 
  if you have no clue about the [ origin of the bosniaks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_bosniaks ) , please read up on it . 
  you 'll find that serbs calling bosniaks ` turks ' is basically an insult , considering they 're not actually turks . 
  they 're the same people as the bosnian serbs , just with a different religion . 
  hehe , ai n't that the truth !, 
  cevapi/cevapcici are much more popular . 
  but these people apparently do n't know that . 
  which is why i linked the black hand , the overarching organisation , a few posts up :  `` on 8 october 1908 , just two days after austria annexed bosnia and herzegovina , some serbian ministers , officials , and generals held a meeting at the city hall in belgrade . 
  they founded a semi-secret society , the narodna odbrana ( `` national defense '' ) which gave pan-serbism a focus and an organization . 
  the purpose of the group was to liberate serbs under the austro-hungarian occupation . 
  they also undertook anti-austrian propaganda and organized spies and saboteurs to operate within the occupied provinces . 
  satellite groups were formed in slovenia , bosnia , herzegovina and istria . 
  the bosnian group went under the name mlada bosna ( `` young bosnia '' ) . '', 
  young bosnia was made of primarily serbs , saying all ethnicities were in it is a bit misleading . 
  especially considering most bosniaks were fine with the ottoman rule . 
  i said i do n't know what his motive was in the way that i do n't know what his exact personal thinking was . 
  we can infer from his choices what he probably thought , yeah . 
  [ like i said , he definitely got the ball rolling ... ] ( http://www.theweek.co.uk/world-news/first-world-war/59782/how-did-the-first-world-war-start ), 
  i 'm not sure about what his motives were , but a few often used idioms come to mind like `` the road to hell is paved with good intentions '' and `` two wrongs do n't make a right '' . 
  and without knowing what was gon na happen ( ww1 and ww2 ) , whether the ends justify the means is a difficult question to answer here . 
  [ the black hand was created in serbia ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_hand_ ( serbia \\ ) ) [ he ( princip ) ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/gavrilo_princip ) was a bosnian serb and came from a serb family . 
  [ it 's meme that celebrates the ethnic cleansing done in bosnia . 
  ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/serbia-strong-remove-kebab ) it 's disgusting if you ask me but hey , i guess i 'm ` biased ' . 
  well , let 's just say that they got the ball rolling ... 
  except that people often have used it as a meme against bosniaks who were n't expansionists . 
  the fact that it became popular because of that nationalist video made during the invasion shows that `` killing islam expansionist = remove kebab '' is simply not true . 
  it 's a celebration of ethnic cleansing . 
  it 's a shit tier meme . 
  the fact that you rant on about having respect for it is rather disgusting . 
  eh , same in dutch tbh ; kopje = small head = cup ... kopje koffie = small head of coffee, 
  hitler would n't have become the fuhrer if it were n't for the great depression & forced war reparations that followed ww1, 
  they blurred it because it detects adblock and decides to make the [ imagewidth max 50 pixels . 
  or just do n't and check out the image here : http://i.imgur.com/aeskcvx.png, 
  wow this is so backward . 
  if you go to another country , i 'd fucking expect you to follow its customs . 
  saying that this is `` submission to misogynistic religious nuttery '' is basically bullshit . 
  yeah that basically sums it up here as well . 
  even with the labour party ` pvda ' usually being center-left ... 
  yes , it 's really weird . 
  here in the netherlands , if you 're liberal , you 're [ considered right wing because on the opposite spectrum , the socialist , is considered left wing ] ( https://puu.sh/tvvdr/f8a647a5ff.png ) . 
  it really depends on how you [ define left or right wing ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/links_ ( politiek \\ ) ) . 
  it gets really tiresome to debate any finer points about whether someone is left or right leaning between people from different countries because of that . 
  good thing the majority of those so-called conservative muslims and christians voted yes according to these numbers ... ? 
  american redditors mostly, 
   17mio my german is a bit rusty but i 'm gon na assume it 's [ 17 million ] ( http://mymemory.translated.net/en/german/english/mio ) and he probably means that the ussr has used a lot of propaganda ( ` trained ' to have trust in russia ) on the people in [ east germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_germany ) after wwii until the fall of the [ berlin wall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_wall ) in 1989 . 
  from what i understand , even eastern countries are becoming less reliant on russia , with the balkan gas hub . 
  bosnia , the netherlands , austria and germany mostly , though considering my background i 've probably just met different kinds of people . 
   the bottom line , though , is that these are weird fucking times . 
  and i hope they get better , and i 'm sure you and i can both agree on that . 
  be well . 
  absolutely !, 
  stay safe , be well . 
   but i still think there 's a massive difference between christianity and islam on this point . 
  yeah i do think that 's fair to say . 
  do n't know how muslims generally behave in the us so i ca n't give any meaningful input on that , sorry . 
   what would happen if a muslim woman in saudi arabia put on a bikini and walked down a busy sidewalk v a christian woman anywhere in america doing the same thing ? 
  picking the most backward country and comparing it to america ? 
  you could also ask the same question about christians in congo/angola ... i mean seriously , compare it to a more westernized muslim country ( i like to use bosnia as an example ) and you 're gon na get a very different answer . 
  it 's got nothing to do with muslims , much more to do with culture and laws, 
  you think christians would react differently ? 
  btw , am muslim , would raise my brow but would n't care . 
  got other shit to worry about than some retard wearing nothing . 
  this reminds me so much of serbian propaganda where they always played the victim role even after all the shit they 've done . 
  it 's either that or the `` but they did it too '' card . 
  the most recent thing involving russia and serbia was russia vetoing the un resolution calling srebrenica a genocide , at the request of serbia . 
  ladies and gentlemen , we got him . 
   * definetely * finite definite [ definitely ] ( http://i.imgur.com/unwmlvb.png ), 
  i have a better plan , we join hands in making the ultimate weapon ... 
  ** spacewaffles !, 
  ** then sell that to the people of malta . 
  we 'll get some profit and they 'll want more . 
  so the population will flock to us ; putting the belgo-dutch alliance in the top of the list . 
  all of europe will fear the power of waffles and weed !, 
  a cultural victory is in sight !, 
  http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=21000 national level so in europe that 'd be 1 ) vatican city ( lol ) 2 ) malta 3 ) the netherlands 4 ) belgium, 
  would imply you 're actually staying to fix things, 
  haha , yep , was still editing it out . 
  did n't see it listed but i should 've doublechecked the map ... http://en.strasbourg-europe.eu/member-states,44987,en.html, 
  yeah , just noticed . 
  edited ... 
  edited it because i noted that the flag is also for coe , from your quote .
