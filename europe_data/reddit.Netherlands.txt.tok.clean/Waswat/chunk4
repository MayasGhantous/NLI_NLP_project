  you could always submit an alternative if you think you can do a better design ? 
  honestly , if this was a problem for ya , why did n't you message the mods earlier ? 
   or the uk technically , the uk is still in the eu . 
  edit2 : and iceland , norway , turkey , russia , ukraine , uk are all part of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe sooooo , the only exception to your list [ is belarus ] ( http://en.strasbourg-europe.eu/member-states,44987,en.html ) ? 
  it 's a weird thing to nitpick . 
   let 's hope it does not come to this . 
  i hope the eu does whatever it needs to do ( since the uk definitely will ) . 
  off-topic :  lackadaisical another word [ learned ] ( http://puu.sh/tlthv/724bda00b3.png ) , thanks !, 
  he posts on t_d , go figure . 
  cheers !, 
  gon na save it and read it later tonight . 
  [ tabloid ... ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tabloid_journalism ), 
  [ tabloid ... ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tabloid_journalism ), 
  wow , got a link ? 
  invasion of citizens privacy is the new british invasion . 
  you 're only proving my point ... 
  except a lot of these people do want to be seen that way . 
  they 're acting like they 're not ukrainian . 
  just like bosnia-born serbs act like they 're not bosnian . 
  these groups of people often do n't have the welfare of the country they live in in mind . 
  if only these people would be more like you , we 'd probably be living in a better place . 
  there 's a huge difference between idolizing a mass murderer and saying crimea is ukraine . 
  if you ca n't see that then there 's something really wrong with you . 
  in response to someone talking about `` human rights violations '' , you compare saying  crimea is ukraine to  heil hitler what a comparison . 
  with no proper link either . 
  are n't they ? 
  i mean , thats why you 're able to use services like facebook , whatsapp , youtube and such for free ... 
  first part is absolutely subjective but  almost no pollution what ? 
  who told you that ? 
  haha that 's pretty cool actually . 
  do they also help each other when something is too high up or some spaces are too small ? 
  noord & zuid holland have the biggest cities which are really crowded , noisy , smelly , expensive , filled with smog & have a high crime rate . 
  why is it not the shittiest part of the netherlands ? 
   you try figuring out how to translate ` the netherlands ' to every single language . 
  why would you ? 
  germans did n't do that either ... 
  the other people did it for them . 
  see - deutschland/duitsland/duiska etc ( from old high german diutisc ) - germany/jerman/djermani etc ( from the latin germania or greek \u0393\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 ) - allemagne/alemania/alimanya etc ( from the name of the alamanni tribe ) - saksa/saks \u0101m\u014d / saksamaa etc ( from the name of the saxon tribe ) - njema\u010dka / n\u00e9metorsz\u00e1g / n\u011bmecko etc ( from the protoslavic n\u011bm\u044cc\u044c ) figuring out what the place is officially called in that language is part of learning the language . 
  it 's the shittiest part of the netherlands though . 
  nizozemska in bosnian & croatian . 
  average height also accounts for the older generation . 
  average height accounts for older generation as well , which were significantly shorter . 
  which of the two ? 
  but ... that 's not the only thing it is the birthplace of ; consider social liberalism . 
  that of `` classical liberalism '' or the idea you 're responding to ? 
  isnt that french ? 
  they are wrong in the mindset of the grass being greener on the other side . 
  it 's a terrible mindset . 
   but only brave people like geert wilders dare to speak the truth . 
  i kek every time people call a sensationalist like wilders a speaker of truth . 
  even in the video you linked he said turkish people will *** never *** be european . 
  the retard thinks that peoples values do n't change . 
  even more funny is him saying they do not want visa-free travels of turks . 
  ignoring what the netherlands [ has done in the past and benefited from greatly ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/turken_in_nederland#de_gastarbeiders ) < [ english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_the_netherlands#history )  . 
  the guy is a total hypocrite and a loudmouth minority in the dutch parliament . 
  they 're not that bad , though i think the wagner/dr oetker/ah bbq chicken pizzas are much better . 
  beautiful is one way to call it . 
  i 'd prefer to call it hideous myself, 
  been happening for quite a while ... one of my dutch friends even used to quote shitty news from ` russia today ' ( now rt ) during the ukrainian crisis , until i told him about it being funded by the russian government ... 
  i remember him saying that the russian forces there are to help and not annex or invade . 
  all i needed to do is ask him why then they had to walk in as a force with their insignias and flags removed ? 
  that made him think . 
  you are comparing killing someone to this ? 
  are you going to do the same shit to other [ archaic laws ] ( http://people.howstuffworks.com/10-archaic-laws.htm ) that are still in effect ? 
  you 're not using your common sense . 
  yep . 
  / u/mrcheapskate _ toyou might not know theres a policy of tolerance / turning a blind eye and using common sense for most law enforcers . 
  can we please stop acting as if it 's likely you 're going to get arrested for a nazi salute ? 
  so you are speculating that the same is happening to / u/meellodi ? 
  i wish would stop fucking conflating saudi muslims with the others . 
  it 's like saying you are saying texans are staying christians because otherwise their redneck dads are gon na shotgun their head off . 
  you 're gon na be better off explaining it 's due to social pressure rather than fear of death . 
  sharia laws differ per country and do n't always impose the part you 're talking about . 
  some barely are strict . 
  you 're saying that 10 % to 20 % of the muslim population would kill someone for switching religion ? 
  unless you get numbers to back that up , i 'm gon na call bullshit on that . 
  by far most people do n't adhere to that principle . 
  most countries do n't follow that rule . 
  that is usually not the reason . 
   it 's not even an atheist argument , i 'd be okay with a deist , or someone with a fuzzy belief in a creator . 
  funny how people like to word this . 
  being muslim does n't mean you 're strongly religious , but it certainly shows the prejudice in here . 
  i bet most of the people that believe what you 're saying would still answer in a similar manner to ops picture despite knowing that there are tons of muslims that are n't ` strongly religious ' . 
   same , i 'd be concerned over my daughter dating anyone who had fervent and deeply held beliefs on things that lack any evidence and defy logic . 
  simply being muslim does n't mean you 're strongly religious though ... 
  fuck , that 's a pretty fucking ignorant response . 
  just because someone is muslim , does n't mean they 're arabic/write or can read arabic . 
  every time i eat a kebab or something similar , i try to have some ayran with it but it 's also great in the morning to wake me up ( i do n't drink coffee ) . 
  these days it 's easy to get in turkish stores in the netherlands . 
  for the dutchmen , it 's basically salty ` karnemelk ' . 
  tbf , it 's not just iced tea ... proper moroccan mint tea is really fucking sweet as well . 
  [ so good . 
  kofola makes me think it 's a combination of ko fol ( which means fake/as joke ) and cola . 
  so fake cola ? 
  not necessary . 
   consensual jokes if the jokes are consensual , the adult you 're talking to likely is n't insulted by them and wo n't punch ya ? 
  political correctness is often about showing respect . 
  you 're not gon na go out and say `` nigger '' to a random black guy in america because you think for some reason that 's funny to you , are you ? 
  you 're gon na think about how he 'll react . 
  now to put it in a bigger picture : do you think it 's fine for a president to state that people coming in from ~ ~ mexico ~ ~ denmark are bringing drugs , crime and are rapists whereas only a minority are good people ?
