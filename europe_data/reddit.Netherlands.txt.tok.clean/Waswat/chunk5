  it is not statistically proven and it is not a joke , so what do you think the point is of that statement and what kind of effect will it have ? 
   you dont even bother reading what is being said point out what you think i have n't read ? 
   you try to limit what i can and cant do right now and you would be dumb not to expect to get punched for it where am i limiting what you ca n't or can say ? 
  this to me looks like yet another childish way of trying to say pc limits you somehow . 
  political correctness does n't deny you the rights to make racial jokes or dark humor in itself . 
  you still have freedom of speech with exceptions on where it is considered hate speech . 
  you are not limited by someone else 's idea of what is okay unless you try to use their platform . 
  i 'd say it 's also really dumb to expect not to get punched for insulting someone directly though . 
   seriously , fuck the european political left . 
  there exists no better word to describe the european political left than the word traitor . 
  i truly and honestly despise and hate the european left , and generally those who seek to uphold the standards of political correctness and multiculturalism . 
  wow . 
  yeah , let 's blanket blame all the people on `` the european left '' for this . 
  what the fuck is wrong with you ? 
  edit : sure , i 'll gladly get downvoted for speaking out on his bullshit blanket statement . 
  looks like a common misconception . 
   the whole thing is a shitshow and we can only cast the blame on one another ai n't that the truth . 
  i just wish this shit was over so us bosnians ( with that i mean bosnian serbs , bosnian croats and bosniaks ) can focus on rebuilding our economy without having each side stopping the other because of some ( imo ) stupid nationalistic thoughts or issues . 
  as for the rest of your comment , fair enough . 
  just because they did n't do it does n't mean they should n't be calling it a genocide . 
   it would indeed paint serbs as genocidal , which we are n't [ serbia was n't even mentioned in the draft ] ( http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7b65bfcf9b-6d27-4e9c-8cd3-cf6e4ff96ff9%7d/s_2015_508.pdf ) so how would it paint serbs specifically as genocidal ? 
  i found the reason the politicians gave total bullshit on that . 
  if anything , if they recognized it it would 've done the opposite to me . 
   but russians would veto it either way , no matter whether they asked them for help or not . 
  that was n't the point , the point was that he politically and publically asked for the veto , rather than actually recognizing it as a genocide . 
   but he went to srebrenica on an anniversary and was attacked there yes , i agree that was absolutely unfortunate . 
  that shit needs to stop . 
  i know a lot of people thought he went there to taunt people , but even then ... that shit needs to stop just as much . 
  i was livid at everyone there . 
  i 'll stick to my opinion that his attack on the character of the commenter with a `` what about kosovo '' type of comment ( i ca n't look it up again as it 's been deleted ) was in bad taste , uncalled for and definitely a whataboutism , despite it being a ` fact ' ( they 're not mutually exclusive ) . 
  http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7b65bfcf9b-6d27-4e9c-8cd3-cf6e4ff96ff9%7d/s_2015_508.pdf have fun , pal . 
  as you can see , serbia was n't even mentioned . 
  aaaand we 're back to insults . 
  nice job . 
  i know why it was denied and i asked you to point it out because i know the reason they gave was bullshit . 
  too bad russia has veto power on everything without having to give out a valid reason . 
   this conversation is completely pointless and is n't leading anywhere no shit . 
  that was my entire point . 
  your condemnation of the guy from kosovo would n't have gone anywhere . 
  glad you got back to your senses . 
  where was it implied the serbian government was involved ? 
  can you point it out ? 
   again , you just divert attention , evade , use smoke and mirrors and try to divert the flow of the conversation to mitigate the facts . 
  you are projecting yourself onto me claiming `` whataboutism '' when i only speak about facts . 
  ah , `` facts '' like  you are the only one trying to ignore crimes and divert attention to fit your own narrative by using a term `` whataboutism '' that you 've heard once in a conversation and happened to like it because you think it proves you are `` smart '' . 
  where you 're guessing what i 've done in the past and apparently know what i 'm thinking ? 
   you are projecting yourself onto me claiming `` whataboutism '' when i only speak about facts . 
  facts and whataboutisms are not mutually exclusive . 
   again , read what `` whataboutism '' is , `` again '' ? 
  you did n't ask me to read anything . 
  furthermore , it 's obvious you have n't read it yourself . 
  that 's quite the projection you 're doing . 
  have you yourself read the links i posted ? 
   you are the only one trying to ignore crimes and divert attention to fit your own narrative by using a term `` whataboutism '' that you 've heard once in a conversation and happened to like it because you think it proves you are `` smart '' . 
  man this shows how little you know . 
  the term has been around for [ a long time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) and serbs have used it every fucking year whenever we talk about the srebrenica genocide . 
  you are part of the problem . 
  i bet you 're one of the people who say `` all lives matter '' when people are protesting `` black lives matter '' , thinking you 're the smart one on the highest moral ground ... 
  when in reality you are diverting attention to the matter at hand . 
  there 's a great reddit post about this kind of thinking [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3du1qm/eli5_why_is_it_so_controversial_when_someone_says/ct8pei1/ ) . 
  please read it and put it in context . 
  [ tomislav was known for denying the genocide ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ngos-criticize-serbian-president-for-genocide-denying ) [ vukcic and his government managed to secure support from its ally russia to veto a un resolution calling the events in srebrenica a genocide ... ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/russia-vetoes-un-srebrenica-genocide-resolution ) can we please stop this nonsense ?

  i mean , that was kind of the point ... to make him see how pointless they are . 
  how easy it is to ` refute ' or contest something with them . 
  that 's why i added the last line . 
  hey look , a whataboutism mixed with an ad hominem . 
   first step in reconciliation is for all sides to acknowledge what they have done ignoring is one thing but the serbian president is denying the genocide happened . 
  that 's quite a step above . 
  man , whataboutisms are really fucking easy to pull off . 
  let 's ignore the other massive amount of massacres that were commited by the serbs . 
  let 's ignore all the hate crimes after the war . 
  you talk about `` willfully and willingly ignoring facts '' while the serbian president is denying ( yes , that 's a giant leap above ignoring ) facts and acting like the genocide did n't happen . 
  hey look how easy whataboutisms are . 
  that does n't make him wrong in his claims or opinion on serbs being just as bad as isis during the war . 
  nor does that make him some kind of hypocrite as he might be criticizing whats happening in kosovo as well . 
  either way though , it 's definitely a whataboutism and detracts from the discussion ... 
  i 'm saying what does that have to do with what we 're talking about ? 
  furthermore , saying this was `` just executing '' civilians kind of shows you did n't read the testimonies that were posted . 
  this . 
  it 's almost like people think that genocide is just statistics ... ? 
  why the fuck would you say that ? 
  this is the worst whataboutism i 've seen ... 
  hehe , i get what you 're saying . 
  guess i just disagree/see things differently . 
  huh ? 
  i 'm not talking about that . 
  i 'm not talking about any kind of honorifics . 
  i find that someone insulting me and booing me when i 'm trying to speak to be extremely counterproductive . 
  it 's not putting someone on a pedestal if you 're quiet when someone is speaking ; it 's common courtesy . 
   the idea is that it is n't a place to do work and run the country , but a place to debate laws and policies the government put forwards i mean , if this were actually true , i would n't allow for people to constantly boo , sneer or on the other side cheer and shout `` hear hear '' whenever someone says something slightly controversial/popular . 
  seems rather counterproductive . 
  nevermind that it is uncomfortable and crowded , which just breeds irritability and mob mentality . 
  somehow reminds me of a zoo . 
  yes !, 
  i absolutely love the scottish and the german ones . 
  actually look like good places to sit down and discuss/listen . 
  yeah same , i actually like the german ones in the album as well . 
  looks pretty modern , clean and sleek . 
   there was a time when the public would watch debates , but then that all stopped when some bloody moron threw a baloon of paint at the chamber during tony blair 's time i 'm guessing you mean this ?
