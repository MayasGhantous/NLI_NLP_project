  oh boy , you sure have a bad view on muslims and like to put a certain attribute to every single one of them . 
  i wonder where idea that originates from . 
   retarded idealistic views `` idealistic views are retarded . 
  never strive for better . '', 
  got it !, 
  i should invoke my defeatist attitude !, 
   states are supposed to have a separate and equal representation they do n't . 
  i just showed you that they do n't . 
  not by population numbers and not by landmass . 
  the only one who does n't know what he 's talking about and keeps spouting bullshit here is you . 
  i find it typical that a guy from maine is really invested in the electoral college and keeping his 1.7 x vote power compared to the national average . 
  i guess your definition of `` equal representation '' is `` my neighborhood needs to be more represented than yours ( even when we have less people ) '' . 
   when i said this is n't the point of my post , so do n't reply to it , and you replied to it 3 times in a row i 'll refer to what i said before . 
  maybe you should read it again . 
  you probably wo n't . 
  if you 're gon na spout nonsense to me , you should be ready to back it up . 
  instead you decided to concede the point by being intellectually dishonest . 
   if i understand correctly you take issue with 1 vote is not equal to 1 vote , this is unfair because there is n't 100 % voter turnout in each state ?? 
  no , you do n't understand correctly because you obviously ca n't read . 
  have a wonderful day . 
  reread what i said in the 4th paragraph . 
  pay close attention to the comparison of wyoming and california and `` i think that 's pretty fucked up and anything but fair . '', 
  ps : you 're impossible to talk to so i 'll just leave it at this as my last comment . 
   but unless u actually read what i write this time i think i 'll be done replying to u mr. teenager whoa . 
  that 's quite a patronizing comment you made there . 
  i might seem like a soft-horn to you , michael , but i 've been around for 28 years !, 
  implying i 've only been around only about half that amount is pretty insulting . 
   but just as a side point that i do n't want you to reply to , because once again , it is n't really the point then why reply to it specifically ? 
  if you do n't want people to respond to something you 'll say , then it 's best not to say anything at all in public or start your own subreddit where / u/michaelfirkins rules supreme . 
  since you did n't do either , you 'll just have to accept that people will respond to it . 
   there were like 130 million voters , 2 or 3 million in favor of clinton does n't matter because a ) it 's not that large compared to the turnout you went on about illegals voting ; i argued that the difference in illegals would n't have mattered for the popular vote if there were less than 3 million illegals voting . 
  if you did n't care about the 3 million difference , then why would you even bring up voter fraud like this when there is n't even concrete evidence of it and the order of magnitude is unlikely to be even close to millions ? 
  there are [ less than a dozen individual cases of noncitizens convicted of registering or actually voting since 2000 . 
  less than a dozen . 
  ] ( http://www.factcheck.org/2016/10/trumps-bogus-voter-fraud-claims/ ) ok , ok . whatever . 
  i suppose that does n't matter . 
  your side point is n't really a point . 
  it was all a ruse . 
  let 's move on to your main point :  the election is supposed to give all of the states a relatively ` fair ' say in matters  it 's not intended to be that so everything is decided by those who live in 2 superpopulated cities/states/whatever note that you 're using ` supposed ' and ` states ' . 
  yeah , i get it , you 're talking about states , but it seems like you do n't get that i 've been about people . 
  * people * are not states and my point is that people in sparsely populated , rural areas , like wyoming get more than [ * three point seven * times as much voting power compared to people in california ] ( https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/fairvote/pages/199/attachments/original/1450119297/2008votersperelector.pdf?1450119297 ) . 
  that means that a vote in wyoming counts for almost 4 in california . 
  or in other words , if someone from wyoming votes trump , you 'll need 4 californians to vote hillary to even that out . 
  i think that 's pretty fucked up and anything but fair . 
  this is why i said `` too bad you 're gon na act like people living in rural areas matter more than people in metropolitan areas . '', 
   if you would like to understand a bit more you could try googling about american government . 
  i hope that clears things up for you thanks for the patronizing ending . 
  i hope this clears it up for you as well . 
  glad you 're not disputing my point . 
   too bad you 're gon na act like people living in rural areas matter more than people in metropolitan areas . 
   i do n't honestly believe that le pen will guide france out of the eu people said the same shit about trump building a wall and repealing obamacare , yet here we have him trying it . 
  if a politician threatens to do something , i do think you should take him seriously . 
   islamic countries do not have a good track record with maintaining the liberal values i hold dear depends on what islamic countries you 're comparing , bosnia is different from pakistan which is different from india , which in turn is different again from saudi arabia ... 
  i think what you 're saying is a cop-out though , as you still have better lgbt rights in countries like for example [ albania , bosnia and even current-day turkey compared to russia ] ( http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/attachments/side_a_rainbow_europe_map_2016_a3_small.pdf ) yet i do n't see you complaining about russian or orthodox christian immigrants . 
  similar things can be said for [ free speech ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking ) . 
   so i do think le pen is a better candidate than macron , i 'm willing to turn a blind eye to her disdain for the eu well , as someone who actually lives in europe , not just goes there on vacation and as someone who cares about what happens to the eu , i hope the french people do n't turn a blind eye to someone that 'd be willing to create a much bigger problem to `` solve '' one ( especially when it can be solved in different ways ) . 
   absolutely not welcome are muslims who think homosexuality should be punished and women should be veiled christians and jehovahs witnesses have been saying that for eons in europe . 
  just a few days ago i even had some old ladies at my door preaching to me how bad the sexualization is on tv ( `` veels te korte rokken !, 
  '' ) , telling me what their views are on homosexuality ( `` het is onaanvaardbaar !, 
  '' ) , that spiritualism and medias depiction of vampires/demons is the work of satan . 
  that these things should not be shown etc etc. . . 
  i agree integration is very important ( and proper integration helps minimize radicalization ) , but you 're focusing on the fact that they 're muslim rather than the fact that they 're from a totally different culture with often even a different type of government . 
  the difference between the candidates in the popular vote was 2.8 million . 
  if you 're saying that 2.8 million ` illegals ' voted for hillary and that is the only reason she won the popular vote , then i think there 's a problem with your voting system . 
  if you 're saying it 's less than that , then it would n't have mattered for the popular vote and the majority of the us citizens still picked hillary . 
  since you do n't have stats to back your claims up , i 'd be inclined to believe the latter , [ rather than the former ] ( http://time.com/4669899/illegal-citizens-voting-trump/ ) . 
  either way though , shit 's fucked . 
  come back when you have actual stats on how many illegals voted . 
  it 's not talking about that as a solution . 
   but wilson 's experiment demonstrates the extent to which the principle of `` one person , one vote '' does n't really apply to electoral politics . 
  the winner-take-all system means that votes in some states are quite literally more valuable to presidential candidates than votes in other states . 
  this is why the candidates tend to spend all of their time in a small handful of battlegrounds . 
   the electoral map , in other words , is something of an organic gerrymander -- the results it produces owe a lot to the way the boundaries are drawn . 
  the difference between this electoral `` gerrymander '' and a true gerrymander comes down to intent : the border between illinois and wisconsin was not created in 1818 with the intent of electing donald trump 200 years later , for instance . 
  it 's basically talking about some votes mattering less due to the way those lines are set up ; effectively making it a gerrymander in that sense . 
  which is why i added gerrymandering to my sentence . 
  either way , electoral collage is pretty shitty . 
  what kind of subreddits do you visit ? 
  the polls nailed it on the popular vote . 
  too bad gerrymandering & electoral college fucked things up and the president turns out to be not what the majority of us citizens picked . 
  [ again . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zczttb10_vo ), 
  i 'm concerned about both , personally . 
  here ? 
  not as a first reply and not as the most upvoted comment . 
  russians meddling in foreign elections is however concerning to many europeans , i believe . 
  especially considering the low amount of trust they have in russia/putin ; so it is not unusual to see replies that express that concern . 
  however , `` it 's the first reply here everytime '' is a terrible hyperbole . 
  be honest , `` you 're a russian troll . '', 
  is n't `` the first reply here everytime '' . 
   overwhelmingly left wing for someone who is extremely right wing , most of reddit is gon na look pretty `` left wing '' . 
  but it is not . 
  assuming this is true ( [ which i do n't find likely ] ( http://plus.lefigaro.fr/note/how-does-france-count-its-muslim-population-20110407-435643 ) ) , you want to stifle this ? 
  how ? 
  people are allowed to follow whatever religion they want , are they not ? 
  or would you prefer that france throws out any kind of ideals for `` freedom of religion '' just for muslims ? 
  what you probably mean is that radicalization is a problem , not islamization . 
  the anti-islam and anti-immigrant rhethoric from le pen is only gon na make that worse . 
  he 's not using sarcasm . 
  he 's actually that ignorant .
