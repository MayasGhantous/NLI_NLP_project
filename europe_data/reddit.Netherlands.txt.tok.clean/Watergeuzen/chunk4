  perhaps so , but we are n't responsible for it . 
  let those that are ( france , us ) take the responsibility if they have the decency , which i suspect they 've not , but we should n't be held accountable for their actions . 
   the eu is not the only means of cooperating with our friends in europe . 
  then i would rather have us find a better means together . 
  thus breaking the treaties open and transform the eu . 
  in warschau pact czech republic ... , 
  they are not actually going to drop a 1000 pounder on a boat . 
  the initial plans where for insurgency forces to sabotage ships in the port . 
  that will include small explosives on the rudder , screws , engine room , rendering the boats useless . 
  it is n't money that 's the problem . 
  we could have projects that help them but that is all temporarily . 
  in the end , these people need to take care of themselves . 
  they should n't be a plant that we need to water everyday . 
   still either way you look at it , the 2011 intervention is the proximate cause of all this . 
  even if large migrations would have taken place but for the gaddhafi government 's patrols . 
  it does n't change the fact that the humanitarian crisis and the weakened security environment in libya are primary drivers of the migration currently . 
  it certainly made it into our problem . 
  but let 's not forget there was an uprising in libya , and even if we had n't bombed ghadafi , there was no saying how he could survive that uprising . 
  maybe libya would have been a second syria , maybe ghadafi would have fallen either way . 
  in any case , libya would 've been weakened with or without the french-led intervention . 
   if nato governments were aware that this eventuality would likely come to pass following toppling gaddhafi ( which by the way went way beyond what was authorized by the unsc ) , then you 'd think they should have responsibly planned for it , instead of coming up with some kind of haphazard boat-bombing campaign . 
  that would be the responsible thing to do to minimize the human suffering caused by the intervention ( which was sold on humanitarian grounds in the first place ) . 
  it 's unclear to me what kind of end-game the coalition had in mind for libya . 
  in any case , it 's fairly safe to say it was n't what it is currently . 
  with regards to going beyond the mandate , do n't forget some european leaders still had an axe to grind with ghadafi . 
  ( lockerbie among them ) and now that they had their chance , they took their revenge . 
   that would be the responsible thing to do to minimize the human suffering caused by the intervention ( which was sold on humanitarian grounds in the first place ) . 
  as said , i do n't know what their end-game was . 
  but whatever they did it failed.however let ` snot forget that doing nothing could have led to a syria scenario . 
  western leaders ca n't do everything , eventhough everybody tends to blame them for everything , they try and fail too , and they have limits none the less . 
  they made a decision which turned out bad , but there 's no saying how the other possible decisions would 've have turned out , * and * something was going to give anyway , the west did n't start the revolution itself . 
  doing nothing wo n't solve anything either . 
  the solution is not and will not be easy , but the best way to start is to keep these people out of europe , and see what we can do for them in africa . 
  these people do n't come from libya , it was no outgrowth of the 2011 intervention , the french intervention in libya did n't cause the migration , it just uncovered a problem that has been there for years before the libyan civil war , but what ghadafi managed to keep under control . 
  this was his weapon , he made himself irreplacable for europe by witholding us from this . 
  he even threatened us this would happen . 
  but some european leaders decided it was worth the risk to remove him . 
   seriously though , this pleases no-one and does n't solve the problem that most nations have too little wealth and too much violence . 
  nothing solves that problem . 
  these people are unwilling or just incapable of building something . 
  there 's nothing we can do about that . 
   so targeting human traffickers , can someone explain to me why this is so bad ? 
  many immigrants would no longer be able to come to europe . 
  that is very concerning to some . 
  if he 's had enough why does n't he do something about it ? 
  or maybe just leave sweden , just like the incoming immigrants , he can emigrate too . 
  in soviet czech republic , t-72 's had farmers . 
  i think it is , thanks for the tip , i just posted it . 
  if they break the law i suggest you perform your civic duty and inform the authorities , if not , they are n't criminals . 
  also a country ca n't be a criminal , it 's not a person . 
   ` where 's the proofs , we need more proofs ! ', 
  nope they are n't , and they are n't the same thing either . 
  mail box firms have other goals than attracting investments . 
  instead of either , for nightlife and [ site seeing ] ( http://www.ijs2go.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ijsblokjes-bezorgen-utrecht.jpg ) i would advice [ utrecht ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=utrecht&amp;biw=2144&amp;bih=1045&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=krrmvcuzjor8uqtygmap&amp;ved=0cagq_auoag&amp;dpr=0.9#imgrc=yybhdix3zkvnxm%253a%3b__mphxhqps3gym%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.vermaatvastgoedzorg.nl%252fuploads%252f2%252f4%252f7%252f4%252f24740081%252f6652596.jpg%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.vermaatvastgoedzorg.nl%252fvastgoed-onderhoud-utrecht.html%3b1280%3b856 ) , for site seeing [ dordrecht ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/29122015.jpg ) is also [ really nice ] ( http://www.heemkundekringgemert.nl/images/dordrecht.1.jpg ) , no experience there in night life though . 
  both are less of a travel too for 1 day . 
  that would be nice for non-dutch viewers . 
  ( it 's geting a lot of downvotes too ) but a good documentary indeed , some interesting interviews too , looking forward to part 2 . 
   the fact that the eu needs this to be popular amongst the public is why i think they wo n't sell us down the river i 'm not sure if this has ever been their goal , and if it was , they probably abandoned it a while a go . 
  otherwise they would n't have behaved as they did , they 've more than earned their reputation . 
  the eu has also always been a project for the elite , not for the public . 
  they do n't carry our interests at heart , they care for the interests of others . 
  and many people are well aware of this by now . 
  the way i see it is that they 're just looking for boundaries , trying out what they can and ca n't sneak through , and if they recieve a public backlash , they 'll back down a little , and see if they can sneak it through at another time in another way . 
   of course , the final agreement will be public for more than a year after it 's made which will be plenty of time for scrutiny , ... 
  the agreement will be public , but it can not be changed regardless of public debates at that point , it 's a yes or no question , and the agreement contains dozens if not hundreds of subjects of which not a quarter will ever be talked about , and even less will ever recieve serious public attention . 
   ... and the european parliament shot down acta thanks to public pressure ( something the eu negotiating team is very mindful of ) , so there 's still hope even if it does turn out to be rotten . 
  yes , they push through their measures until they reach firm opposition . 
  does n't tell a lot about the motives in the ep . 
  the things i 've seen of the ep is that it 's rotten through it 's very core , and the average parliamentarian lives on another planet . 
   but that the ep shot down acta is merely another indicator that there 's no reason to distrust the eu - because the negotiating team is already wary of what will be acceptable to the ep , and they will negotiate with what 's politically possible to pass in mind . 
  well i gues it shows they do back down under sufficient public support , but that is no reason for me to trust them . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/dossier-europese-unie/jean-claude-juncker-katholiek-die-leugentje-niet-schuwt~a3689972/ )  ` we decide something , let it rest and see what happens . 
  if nobody makes any noise and there 's no revolution , because the people do n't understand what 's decided anyway , then we continue . 
  step by step , until there 's no way back . ', 
  this is exactly what european politics are , and i do n't trust them for a dime . 
  i admire if you do , but we have been decieved and lied to for years , over and over . 
  so fool me once , shame on you , fool me twice ... 
  [ yes , here ] ( https://youtu.be/mpbnf1q_6tg?t=5m22s ) you see one of them assaulting a reporter . 
  lovely people . 
  because otherwise all multinationals will go sit in one place and only pay taxes in germany or the uk . 
  causing all the other countries to lose all income . 
  it 's also a way for developing economies plagued by corruption and bureaucracy to attract some business . 
  all in all the only way to impose a european rate is if the larger states are going to compensate other states with free transfers , or that we reinstate borders for capital flows and tax them individually . 
  and pay that tax for the companies by lowering the membership contribution to the eu . 
  money talks indeed . 
   the eu is seen as a couple of buildings in brussels where they 're magically producing all that sunshine , lollipops and rainbows . 
  i thought the eu is a couple of buildings in brussels where they 're only producing thunderstorms , sour herring and lightning strikes ? 
  damn you really are dim , it 's like you understand nothing that you hear or read , and posses the intellectual capacity of a stillborn . 
  yet you ramble on like a chicken without a head . 
  and then the anger issues combined , you must 've a tough life , i 'm sorry for that . 
  there 's no haste , type away whenever you find some time . 
  i admire that , i do n't give them the benefit of doubt , i have n't yet seen a reason to do so . 
  but perhaps it wo n't , maybe they 'll exclude some sectors , and find satisfactory agreements in others . 
  [ wc-eend ] ( http://thepostonline.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/wceend1.jpg ) ( toilet duck ) it 's a [ saying ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/wij_van_wc-eend_adviseren_wc-eend ) from a tv commercial , where they say `` we from wc-eend advice wc-eend '' . 
  perhaps it did n't cross borders  ( yet ) . 
  it means that if you 're going to profit from some choice a person makes , of course you 're going to advice him making that particular choice . 
  in this case a company advices the consumers to buy their product over the competition . 
  and the eu will say the same over the things they benefit from . 
  how do you know when there 's no final treaty yet , and we do n't know what it will contain exactly ? 
  obviously if they wish to reach an agreement it will change standards , since they want to unify/converge those .
