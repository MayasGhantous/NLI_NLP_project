evil communist homosex nazis , obviously . 
  pfft , we 're dutch , germans are just hill dutch , and austrians mountain dutch . 
  dutch people tend to be kind of sober-minded and sober-living , at least compared to southern european nations . 
  dutch food tends to be cheap , simple , and boring , for example . 
  is n't that a stereotype about us ? 
  also caravans blocking german autobahns . 
  i like it but the different sides feel like they 're pretty similar compared to the pretty wild differences between units in the first two ra 's . 
  aside from japan 's transformer units all sides have , for example , a roughly equally performing mbt , advanced tank , naval units , etc. 
  and the advantages of each side are kind of meh . 
  overall though i think it 's decent if you can get over the cartoony graphics . 
  naval combat is pretty awesome in ra3 imo . 
  for one , i was joking , second , the guy is always one of the leading parties in the polls recently . 
  if we ever get in a position where the two countries can join , * they * are joining * us * . 
  not the other way around . 
  three questions : 1 . 
  do you have geert wilders ? 
  do you have geert wilders in any position to become prime minister ? 
  do you have privatised health care ? 
  if the answer to all three questions is `` no '' i wo n't withdraw my position . 
  screw that . 
  or , you know , maybe the accusations that putin will start a genocide are just unfounded . 
  putin 's already an asshole , no need to make stuff up to make him look even worse . 
  but he did make his intentions about it pretty clear [ early on . 
  i can agree with that . 
  i 'm pretty sure he means his actual face . 
  if he does n't , i do . 
  that 's a big fucking roundabout . 
  you mean sweden alone ? 
  i doubt other european nations would just look away if sweden is invaded by russia . 
  as for europe as a whole , the french and german defense budgets combined are already larger than russia 's , and that 's just two countries . 
  how does a russian rocket prepared by a russian ground crew not have anything to do with russia ? 
  you go girl !, 
  i remember walking on top of that . 
  i got a text from my provider , wishing me a warm welcome in poland/czech republic every five minutes when i was walking around a bit . 
  well it 's not something you really see them in a lot in most places . 
  i confused the touran with the touraeg , i was wrong about that one . 
  but i have never seen the volvos . 
  dutch police usually drives around in volkswagen golfs or ~ ~ touraegs . ~ ~ ( tourans ) never seen a police bmw . 
  most of his votes are from old and/or sheltered people who see the government and foreigners as greedy fucks t ` king err jerbs and fall for his populist bullshit . 
  an example of that was his attempt to dissolve the new government the day it was formed , because it got him media attention and people at home thought he was standing up like some brave hero to the big scary gubment , even though he just did it for attention as it has no chance of success at all . 
  can you give some context with this picture ? 
  i have no idea what 's going on . 
  this is a deal i can actually support . 
  people like you are kind of the problem . 
  like all of / r/conspiracy who think that america needs a casus belli against russia ( because invading a country is n't enough apparently ) . 
  geenstijl.nl ; your official source for high quality political news . 
  [ netherlands-belgium-germany ] ( http://nl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bestand:vaals-drielandenpunt-monument.jpg ), 
   keep calm and downvote the picture and my posts . 
  good thing i already did that , then . 
   first of all , i really do n't want to offend anyone around here . 
  too bloody late . 
  those dutch billions which are probably a drop in the bucket . 
  russia makes billions of dollars a year from oil and gas , but i do n't see you condemning countries like germany , turkey , the uk , italy or the `` cruel irony '' of ukraine who buy [ a lot more russian gas ] ( http://www.gazpromexport.ru/en/statistics/ ) than the netherlands . 
  admit it , you 're either just here to hate on the netherlands , you have no idea what is going on , or both . 
   so yeah , a picture is worth a thousand words . 
  and another famous saying is : follow the money !, 
  the cruel irony may be that some dutch money could have contributed financing the separatists and their missile who downed mh17 . 
  in the same way that putin 's breath is responsible for the growth of a tree in the back of my yard . 
  blaming the death of hundreds of people on the dutch royal family attempting to sooth the damaged diplomatic relation with russia is the most disgusting form of victim blaming i 've ever heard of . 
  just rack off with your attempted edginess ... 
  this was a picture taken two weeks before the whole mess in crimea even started . 
  this was an attempt to improve relations with russia after a netherlands-russia year that went terribly wrong for various reasons . 
  around this time , ukraine was in a civil war , and it was * no countries business * except for ukraine . 
  you are trying to project this event onto the current situation in ukraine but that simply does n't work , euromaidan was not the business of putin nor the dutch government , and while your vagueness makes it impossible for anyone to know exactly what you mean , it 's probably wrong . 
  if you could now either justify this ridiculous nonsense over here and on / r/thenetherlands or rather just delete it , that 'd be great . 
  shortie . 
   you know ... that 's what hitler wanted to do i do n't just know , i literally copied the name of the canal from the wiki page on reichskommissariat moskowien . 
  i feel like opening the sluices of the moscow-volga canal so moscow turns into an artificial lake , letting them know what a dutch revenge feels like . 
  i 've been really pissed and i 've found it hard to stay calm and think rationally about it . 
  i just ca n't believe those idiots would even bother shooting a plane at 10,000 meters anyway . 
  according to the article :  now in lithuania , the minimum monthly wage is 1,000 litas and the minimum hourly way is 6.06 litas . 
  those values are almost exactly the same as the `` new '' minimum wages , just in litas instead of euros . 
  the current minimum hourly wage is 6.06 litas , that 's about [ 1.75 euros ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=6.06+litas+to+euros&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=sb&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=rxg0u537etgx-abwpidydg ) . 
  there 's almost no increase . 
  i kind of like the song but i have no idea what the hell the message of the song is supposed to be . 
  why does your flair text read `` australia '' when it 's the flag of hungary ? 
  prediction : by half time , france is behind 0-4 , but then the english , canadian and american team run on the field and germany loses after all . 
  you just made me tear up a little . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  we moved eastward and southward to claim new land just in case the dikes break . 
  he was probably making a joke about ww2 . 
  they t ' k err belgium, 
  thank you dear flairless heathen . 
  pretty much . 
  i could go out and protest against the font used on expiration dates on milk cartons and i 'd be fine as long as i do n't call for an assault on milk cartons . 
  not to doubt what you said , but do you have a source ? 
  it 's a pretty specific claim . 
  it 's included under `` rest of ussr '' . 
  if you would show all of the russian empire as `` russia '' the way those deaths were divided over the empire would n't be as clear as it is now . 
  that 's pretty much true . 
  us does n't use the challenger , they use the abrams . 
  and sadly , it appears that he 's [ doing pretty well in the polls ] ( https://www.noties.nl/peil.nl/ ) . 
  yup . 
  a mac user can get iwork completely free now . 
  those who had macs without iwork installed could just download a trial version , then update to the full new version for free . 
   ( and perhaps even iwork ) from my experience , keynote may be one of the most prominent competitors to powerpoint there is . 
  pages is also still extremely popular amongst mac users . 
  i 'd say microsoft does n't hold much of a monopoly on software anymore ; a huge market share , but no monopoly .
