  ( note : i actually like german beer , but i needed an analogy ) . 
  please give proper tea a try !, 
  in dutch , ` war ' still means confusion ( e.g. 
  `` ik ben in de war '' : `` i am confused '' ) . 
  there 's still a huge debate on nature vs nurture , so your final statement is rather disputed . 
  what we do know , as a fact , is that men and women ( * in general * < - do i have that add that disclaimer ? ), 
  learn differently . 
  and it is not fair to disadvantage men by forbidding or punishing masculine ways of learning . 
  besides , what ( at least i ) am saying is not at all that something is a ` domain ' of women or of men . 
  that would be rather binary . 
  * again * , there are multivariate means and distributions around those means . 
  no , you are interpreting the term ` statistical fact ' wrong . 
  it 's a case of averages : there are lots of masculine women , and feminine men , but on average , men are more masculine and women more feminine . 
  surely , you 've noticed there 's a * general * difference between the interests of men and women ? 
  i started learning english at maybe age 10 or so . 
  i find myself correcting ` native ' speakers fairly often . 
  just an example : if you read this website , you will see that the ones writing ` of ' when they should have written ` have ' are usually british english speakers . 
  [ * cough * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_conquest_of_britain ) [ * cough * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norman_conquest_of_england ) [ * cough * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glorious_revolution ), 
  2/3rds of icelanders all live in the same city , whereas the other nationalities mentioned are all over the place ( and all , except the frisians , all have millions of speakers ) . 
  which german article ? 
  did you try to add a link ? 
  edit : link was added . 
  disregard this message , 
  the only thing i changed was ` festering swamp ' to ` festering marshland ' ( which is correct , as you also state ) , so i 'm not sure what you mean with ` actually ' . 
  edit : to give some extra info , marshland and swamp are not the same . 
  there is a difference in vegetation types primarily . 
   festering marshland ...     also called `` the netherlands '' ... ftfy !, 
  we all lost our empires . 
  wwii may have accelerated things a bit , but they were being phased out anyways . 
  it was a combination of more aware and educated internal populations ( as we educated the native population , i 'm sure you did the same in india and elsewhere ) , leading to rebellion , and pressure from the usa , as it saw itself as an anti-colonial power . 
  so maybe wwi is more to blame than wwii , since that is when us isolationism truly ended . 
  not gon na happen . 
  estonia likes finland too much . 
  poland-lithuania though ... 
  maybe culture shock is not the right word , because it is supposed to happen pretty quickly . 
  however , since i am moving to another country for a while , i 'm reading up on the experiences of others , and they report a subtle sense of ` alienation ' or ` out of placeness ' that really only becomes noticeable after having lived in another country for a few months , after the ` honeymoon period ' has died down . 
  [ heck cattle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heck_cattle ) ? 
  they are still around as well . 
  edit : the difference is that heck cattle were bred based on aesthetics , i.e. 
  `` does it look like an aurochs ? '' . 
  if i understand correctly , the current tauros project is based more on actual genetics data . 
  ah , thanks . 
  as i wrote , i was n't sure if i recalled it correctly . 
  however , the dutch revolt 's official starting time is 1568 , which is before the union of arras is signed ( there was some fighting , or at least some posturing with troops , but fairly minor compared to later warfare ) . 
  in your defense , supposedly he turned out to be a pretty swell king actually . 
  you revolted with us ... 
  the revolt started in the south actually . 
  flanders , brabant , artois ( atrecht ) and holland if i recall correctly . 
  but the the north carried on after the south signed the union of arras . 
  then why did you invade the already meritocratic netherlands and install a * king * here ; /, 
  does poland have the dutch/norwegian option ? 
  that is , both of those countries have the materials , facilities and the expertise available to construct a nuclear device within about 1 year . 
  there are some pretty smart polish scientists around , but i do n't know if you have the facilities for uranium enrichment , or the materials . 
  you need to read up on your history mate , but then again , beyond 100 years ago is an awfully long time for an american ... edit : for the record , one guy used a ( wrong ) national stereotype , so i thought it was appropriate to use a stereotype myself as well . 
  i will leave it to the reader to determine if the american stereotype is based in fact or not , 
  as far as i know , they are n't doing this `` frantically '' at all . 
  they had built some initial protections fairly quickly around the ship shortly after the accident . 
  this morning , the dutch news was quoting one of the guys in charge of the nature reserve that they were waiting for the weather to become a bit more clear before continuing with this process , but that they were n't too worried because there had not been that much oil seepage , and there were backup plans and equipment in place in case it did get worse . 
  that 's unfortunate for french . 
  however , french has been the language of the ( european ) international elite for roughly 5 centuries . 
  this was even the case when england was already ruling the waves . 
  english has only really become the international language in the last century , mostly due to american hegemony ( but obviously , the british empire has helped tremendously as well ) . 
  i 'm not so sure if , four centuries from now , english wo n't be on the decline . 
  maybe mandarin will rise in prominence , but it too will fall for something new eventually . 
  and perhaps mandarin will never rise to the same degree , due to inherent weaknesses such as being a tonal language , which is fairly unique and therefore difficult to learn for most peoples of this world , and due to the non-alphabetic written language . 
  the netherlands , and since religion appears to be important to you , definitely a bible belt area . 
  bonus points : if you move to an area near the hoge veluwe , you have a place to go if you [ ever feel homesick ] ( http://www.vanderkrogt.net/standbeelden/object.php?record=gl15ab ) . 
   the monument came to be located in the otterlose zand , as during a visit to de hoge veluwe , christiaan de wet was inspired to comment how this landscape reminded him of the african velt . 
   kameraad i am very confused as to why dutch is spoken in regards to this coup ? 
  the franks are divided into the salic franks ( roughly netherlands + belgium ) and the ripuarian franks ( roughly western part of germany ) . 
  he may have been born in aken , but he was a salic frank . 
  also , ( low ) frankish is the direct ancestor of dutch , whereas ( high ) german comes from another branch . 
  you can quite nicely see on [ this map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franconian_languages#/media/file:niederfr%c3%a4nkisches-niederl%c3%a4ndisches_sprachgebiet.png ) how close aken actually is to the later territory of low frankish . 
  cool , now we can do some proper math . 
  so since  german + french = dutch we have dutch + italian = swiss dutch + duke = luxembourg dutch + nordic + celtic = british following proof by contradiction , everything you have said is clearly false since we know that dutch + italian = abomination and dutch + nordic + celtic = doggerland . 
  in another thread i 've seen nilfgaard referred to as ` habsburg ' , which certainly would tie together seemingly disparate elements such as spain ( indeed charles v ) , austria , the netherlands and the ( rest of the ) hre . 
  you might be right . 
  when i look a bit more at the names of these people , there 's actually more dutch there than in other areas ( menno coehoorn , van canten , leeuvaarden , de wett ) . 
  i suppose i am automatically trained to see oppressing empires in medieval settings as coming from the south ( e.g. 
  spain ;p ) , and the armor can also be seen worn by spanish lords that fought in the netherlands , e.g. 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fernando_%c3%81lvarez_de_toledo,_3rd_duke_of_alba ) and [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ambrogio_spinola,_1st_marquis_of_the_balbases ) . 
  but overall , indeed hre makes more sense . 
  certainly from the polish perspective . 
  of course , there are some large differences as well , such as the fact that the hre emperor was not as important as emhyr , and the hre not being as coordinated as nilfgaard seems to be . 
  it 's got a bit of everything ( but i would say predominantly slavic ) . 
  i can recognize the dutch parts , e.g. 
  and the empire of nilfgaard is heavily southern european . 
  the netherlands is more similar to northern germany than it is to northern france . 
  also historically . 
  and we 've shared nobility with everybody . 
  in fact , moreso with the germans because we were part of the hre . 
   it was an important thing to be able to have , as it allows the usa an option to drop a nuke on someone without popping off a minuteman . 
  do n't you also have submarines that can launch those ? 
  i assume russia is n't capable of reliably tracking such platforms . 
  not just iran . 
  turkey can also keep the russian black sea fleet out of the mediterranean if required . 
  it 's quite a strategic location . 
  it is possible that they take this angle , because the ` democracy ' in turkey is based on lies . 
  erdogan controls the media and therefore controls the people . 
  it goes even further back to indo-european [ tewt\u00e9h ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%c3%beeod ) ; which is also the source for old irish t\u00faath and lithuanian tauta .
