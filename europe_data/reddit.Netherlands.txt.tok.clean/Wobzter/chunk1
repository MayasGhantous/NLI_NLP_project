it is expected that it wo n't affect tourism . 
  it may affect near-border commuting . 
  i think it 'll be an incentive for dutch people along the border to just do their shopping in the netherlands , instead . 
  especially if it 'd be for a once-a-year kind of shopping . 
  well , in that case , i think silicon valley will still be more revolutionizing with their teslas and robotic cars . 
  they affect the masses , whereas aeromobil will only affect the elite ( those with the time and money to obtain pilot training ) . 
  if that 's the case , then i doubt people will choose aeromobil over teslas and robotic cars ( as the title of your post says ) . 
  the revolutionizing part of aeromobil would be that virtually * anyone * would be able to fly . 
  if you require people to have a pilot license , this would be limited to the small percentage who 's able to afford such a license money - and time-wise . 
  on the other hand , if you do make it more accessible , we 'll be dealing with 1 . more aeromobils in the air , increasing chances of accidents and 2 . more drivers with limited experience in the air , increasing chances of accidents even more . 
  if this really takes ( which 'll depend partially on the price ) , i could see infrastructure and law making quite some changes for it . 
  for example : - increased number of runways for these cars . 
  - no-fly zones ( near airports , above urbanized areas , etc. ), 
  - safety standards ( to avoid death when two bump into each other , or to avoid death when someone 's out of gas and still in the air , new driver 's license type ) . 
  perhaps they 'll have to become equipped with an auto-pilot which takes over control in dangerous situations . 
  we used to be a colonialist , slave trading , stock exchange inventing , painting , belgium-blocking country which helped russia get a strong navy . 
  now we 're all just high . 
  countries change ,, 
  you are n't a very * loving * person ... 
  though some of it might change upon my mood : http://imgur.com/lep11qu, 
  no , more than one per 10 million are needed . 
  consider austria : they have about 8 million people and only 1 medal , but they 're on the map . 
  i can agree with this . 
  only tip if you think it is worthy of a tip . 
  and once you tip , make it something easy . 
  so do n't be nitpicking about making $ 36.50 into 1.15 * $ 36.50 = $ 41.98 . 
  just make it a nice round number . 
  if you do n't , it 'll feel like you 're tipping because you 're supposed to , not because you appreciate what they did . 
  considering this comes from nato , i can imagine they would like to address why they are important ( as would anyone do when they make a video concerning their own things ) . 
  so to put this is perspective , is this thought ( irrespective of the justification ) as prominent as this video makes it out to be ? 
  but over here you just have to say it once and you 'll never get it . 
  ( unless you change your mind and ask ), 
  she 's also a spokesperson and a new icon to this cabinet . 
  like it or not , it does matter . 
  people will take you more serious if your looks comply with your job . 
  that 's true with any job , but especially true if you 're also a spokesperson/icon/face of department . 
   and transport what ? 
  moose ? 
  how about everything being transported from china to europe right now ? 
  it 'll be signifantly quicker : http://i.imgur.com/icjeqwl.jpg . 
  similar distances apply to norway - california : 11k through the north pole and 15k through panama . 
  the image if from south korea , but there 's only 700km between shanghai and south korea . 
  not only is it quicker but it 'll be politically easier . 
  there 's only one country which can meddle with you : russia . 
  the other routes , those currently used , can be meddled with more easily by other countries . 
  so if we did n't block you guys , flanders / northern belgium would 've been far richer than the south , right ? 
  would you in this case make the french-speaking population a second rate citizen ? 
  i mean , apparently economic inferiority is ' a major cause ' ; so it would go both ways , right ? 
  thanks for the elaborate reply . 
  i must admit , there is one thing i did n't consider/underestimated , and that are the back-up supplies . 
  i did n't know that , finland for example , is good for 5 months without any import . 
  that 's really impressive !, 
  ooh , i see !, 
  that 's cool !, 
  over here , in the netherlands , we have a large gas reservoir in the northern part of the country . 
  but due to extraction more and more mini-earthquakes are happening there ( sometimes leading up to a richter-scale 3.0 earth-quake ), 
  that 's not what i meant . 
  do you have the tools to extract and distribute it by tomorrow ? 
  just having gas is not the same as being able to use gas . 
  i may have gas under my house as well , but as long as i do n't have any tools to extract it , it has no use to me ( besides maybe making my land property worth more ) . 
  my point is , if you need a week to set up ways to extract and distribute it , you 'd still be in the cold for an entire week . 
  but do you have the means to extract that gas by tomorrow ? 
  and is the lng provided by ships or by pipelines from the us to europe ? 
  http://www.total.com/en/energies-expertise/oil-gas/trading-shipping/fields-expertise/transportation-storage/shipping-vessels-under-scrutiny?%ffbw=kludge1%ff oil tanker sails at 20 knots , which is about 40 km/h . 
  the distance between the us and latvia is http://www.mapcrow.info/distance_between_riga_lg_and_new_york_us.html about 6800km . 
  so that 's 170 hours travel time , about a week . 
  so you 'd be a significant gas deficit for a week if russia went all rage-quit on you guys ... 
  i suppose that 's actually doable . 
  awesome :d !, 
  do you have any figures on how much of your current energy production is done by coal ? 
  and where do you import from gas from ? 
  ( i imagined the case in which russia went all rage-quit like and stopped provided anything to the eu ) . 
  it seems you are indeed right . 
  my apologies . 
  sweden uses gas / oil for about 26 % . 
  indeed not a lot , especially considering it probably gets a lot from norway . 
  looking at finland , it uses oil for 26 % and gas for 9 % . 
  i 'm not sure what the share of russian oil over all oil is in finland , though . 
  indeed , they are not extremely high percentages ( though a total of 35 % is not insignificant if the share of russian oil is near 100 % , which i have no idea about ) . 
  the ones who do depend on oil and gas heavily ( and have a high percentage at the link i gave ) are lithuania ( 35 % oil , 37 % of which 100 % russian for gas ) , latvia ( 30 % oil , 27 % gas of which 100 % russian gas ) , hungary ( 25 % oil , 35 % gas of which 60 % is russian gas ) . 
  slovakia ( 20 % oil , 26 % gas of which 98 % is russian gas ) , bulgaria ( 20 % oil , 13 % gas of which 92 % is russian gas ) , czech republic ( 20 % oil , 15 % gas of which 78 % is russian gas ) and greece ( 46 % oil , 14 % gas of which 76 % is russian gas ) . 
  unfortunately i do n't have any data on what percentage of oil consumption is russian oil , but the source i provided said that 32.6 % of the oil imports are russian , and this source ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_policy_of_the_european_union ) says that the eu imports 82 % of its oil . 
  thus russian oil accounts for around 25 % of all oil used in europe ( which is more than the percentage for gas , because there the eu only imports 57 % ) . 
  so we can assume that the numbers indicated in my first source , which state the reliance of russia for the consumption of gas are similar ( and actually higher ) when talking about oil , rather than gas . 
  thus , using this assumptions , that the numbers are similar , countries rely on russian imports for up to 70 % of their energy consumption : lithuania ( 72 % ) , latvia ( 57 % ) , hungary ( 36 % ) , slovakia ( 50 % ) , bulgaria ( 30 % ) , czech republic ( 28 % ) and greece ( 45 % ) . 
  this is indeed far from the picture i sketched , you are right . 
  it is , however , not as small as you sketched either . 
  fortunately these are all small countries . 
  i wonder how long it 'll take before the problems are solved , though . 
  also , in your defense , right now some of those countries have way higher ratios of renewable energy , so the source you provided will have only changed more in your benefit over time . 
  well , it was an interesting search !, 
  thanks !, 
  it seems you 're right . 
  in ` my defense ' . 
  russia also offers gas to a lot of countries , see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_in_the_european_energy_sector and here we do find a lot of countries in the 80-100 region . 
  and although there may be alternatives in the long run , the immediate havoc caused by closing pipelines is something not be underestimated , i believe ... 
  especially during the winter . 
  throughout all of eastern europe , including the baltics ? 
  the costs would n't , but the cold winters would . 
  edit : ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_in_the_european_energy_sector ) : `` in 2007 , the european union imported from russia 185 million tonnes of crude oil , which accounted for 32.6 % of total oil import , and 100.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent of natural gas , which accounted 38.7 % of total gas import .
