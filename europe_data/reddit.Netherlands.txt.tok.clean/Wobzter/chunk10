  if there was always the security of having a job with a high income to meet your needs : sure , your point is valid . 
  but sometimes you take a shitty job because it 's all there is . 
  so is there anything i missed ? 
  also , thanks for taking the time to reply to all of this . 
  as it is , i 'm still forming my opinion on all of this , and discussions like this help me greatly . 
  so thank you for that . 
  i fully understand why nursing pays less than engineering . 
  and that makes perfect sense in a capitalist world we live in . 
  i 'm not talking about that . 
  i 'm actually talking about the ridicule you would 've suffered from potentially being caught playing with dolls . 
  it was not `` cool '' to do so . 
  boys need to be `` cool '' . 
  and as a young guy , this means playing lego as a form of design , rather than dressing as a form of design . 
  look , i 'm not saying that these gender roles we have ( which , yes , are relatively weak in the west as compared elsewhere ) do affect children . 
  although kids will give their kids legos or barbies if they ask for it , irrespective of their gender , there is still peer pressure and children-marketing which affects their behaviour in such a way that guys play more with lego and less with barbie than they would if there was no peer pressure or marketing ( and vice versa for girls ) . 
  this , later on , affects their career choices . 
  again , it 's not a one-on-one relationship , but it does affect it . 
  and since nurses simply make less money than engineers , the effect is that part of how we apply gender roles early on will affect their `` expected income later on '' . 
  anyway , `` business is blind for gender '' is unfortunately not entirely true ( as op shows ) . 
  it 's mostly true , but not entirely . 
  to first show that it does matter : irrespective of how we got here ( either biologically or culturally ) , women are more likely to go into nursing and men are more likely to go into engineering . 
  [ this source ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/us/job=registered_nurse_%28rn%29/hourly_rate ) shows a yearly pay between $ 42k - $ 82k . 
  meanwhile [ this source ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/us/job=software_engineer/salary ) says that the yearly pay of a software engineer ( heavily dominated by men ) is at $ 52 - $ 117 . 
  and i can give you other examples , administration versus civil engineering , etc. 
  as it stands , the `` popular '' career choices for women have a lower income than the `` popular '' career choices for men . 
  now suppose , hypothetically , that what is `` popular '' is purely based on culture and social construct ... 
  if this is true , simply because of how our culture is , men on average get more money than women . 
  because we give young girls barbie dolls and plastic mini-kitchens while we give guys lego and computer games ( taking the example to the extreme , but i 've seen it happening far too often and you get my point ) , we 're already giving women less chance on a high income than we 're giving men ... 
  simple because we define for them what is `` popular '' . 
  now as i said , it was a hypothetical situation . 
  but the truth is , we do n't ** know ** whether it 's based on biology or culture . 
  the idea is so ingrained in our society based on some valid arguments ( they are biologically different ) that we automatically assume their `` natural sense of nurturing '' to be true as well . 
  not to go off-topic ... but til you can add in entire tables likes that on reddit : o. i guess it 'd be interesting to make a questionnaire among the workforce with the following questions : 1 . 
  what is your gender ? 
  what is your age ? 
  how many hours per week do you work ? 
  how many hours do you want to work ( income consideration included ) ? 
  are you holding a position of management ? 
  would you like to hold a position of management ? 
  and in particular , it would be interesting to see the connection between the answers . 
  [ this source ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/arbeid-sociale-zekerheid/publicaties/barometer-beroepsbevolking/barometer-bevolking-15-65-art.htm ) shows the amount of people 15-65 , the `` potential working population '' . 
  as you can see at the bottom , there are about as many men as women . 
  the difference is , in my opinion , negligible . 
  why did you assume the opposite , though ? 
  i mean , why did you assume there are more men in the workforce than women ? 
  edit : and then i make the same mistake again . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  if 67 % of women work , compared to [ what this source ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?vw=t&amp;dm=slnl&amp;pa=71738ned&amp;d1=24-25&amp;d2=a&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=6,11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46,51,60,65,l&amp;hd=140304-0958&amp;hdr=g1,t&amp;stb=g2,g3,g4 ) says to be 78 % , there are also 78/67 - 1 = 16 % more men working than women . 
  so , based solely on this , we 'd expect women to make up 67 / ( 78 +67 ) = 46 % of the management positions . 
  this deviation of 46/50 = 0.92 we can multiply out 23 % with to get the expected percentage of women in management jobs if only full-time workers can have management positions . 
  and this would be become 0.23 * 0.92 = 21.2 % . 
  so yes , even closer to the 18 % . 
  so the gap is indeed smaller than i even sketched it was . 
  nonetheless , there is a gap ; let 's not lose sight of that . 
  an unnecessary gap . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're being sarcastic ... 
  but the question is ; are these interesting imposed by society ? 
  because women are `` naturally more nurturing '' they are more likely to go into nursing ... 
  but are they * naturally * more nurturing , or are they simply as a result of social construct ? 
  one thing which is special about the netherlands is the amount of part-time workers we have . 
  in particular , the amount of female part-time workers . 
  [ this source in dutch ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/arbeid-sociale-zekerheid/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2012/2012-3580-wm.htm ) says that in 2011 67 % of all women have a job . 
  in the graph you can see that that about 18 % of women have a full-time job . 
  that means that ( 67-18 ) / 67 = 73 % of all working-women have a part-time job . 
  meanwhile in [ this source ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/dossiers/vrouwen-en-mannen/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2013/2013-3729-wm.htm ) we read that `` 87 % of all working men have a full-time job '' . 
  thus , 13 % of working men have a part-time job , compared to 73 % of working women . 
  or otherwise said , 87 % of men versus 27 % of women have a full-time job . 
  ( note : i assumed the workable population of men and women is equal , which it approximately is ) . 
  while [ this source in dutch ] ( http://www.nu.nl/economie/4005293/vrouw-met-voltijdbaan-net-zo-vaak-manager-als-man.html ) says that for all full-time workers , there are as many female managers as there are male managers . 
  now if we assume that only full-time working people can be managers , we would assume that the ratio of full-time workers men : women would be equal to the ratio of managers men : women . 
  doing the calculation , as a percentage as op gave us , gives us 27 / ( 87 +27 ) = 23 % . 
  this 23 % is our `` equilibrium '' number if only full-time workers can be managers . 
  however , since part-time workers can be managers as well ( and there , there is a gender gap ) , we end up at 18 % . 
  ** so to put all of this in perspective ** : 18 % seems extremely low . 
  but this is because women only represent 23 % of all full-time workers . 
  if we want to raise the number of 18 % the most effective way is for more women to take on full-time jobs , since for full-time job managers there is bias towards gender . 
  there is a bias for part-time managers , heavily favouring men . 
  and so another way to tackle the gender gap is to have more women in part-time get a managers function . 
  my guess , and this is purely hypothetical , is that most part-time managers are people in the later stages of their life , having acquired their position through promotions in their career . 
  since decades ago the gender gap was more prevalent , this is still visible in this group . 
  so my guess is that once they ( the male part-time managers whom i 'm guessing are in their later stage of their life ) go into retirement , the percentage of female part-time managers will increase and be closer to equilibrium ( bringing the 18 % to 23 % if current full-time/part-time gender-bias stays the same ) . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : the two main issues is that women only take up 23 % of all full-time positions . 
  for full-time workers the percentage of female managers is 23 % ( perfect equilibrium , men : women = manager men : manager women ) . 
  for part-time workers there is no equilibrium ( manager men : manager women  men : women ) and there is still a gender gap . 
  to increase the current 18 % to 50 % we need more female full-time workers ( or more men part-time workers ) and equality for part-time managers . 
  i understand why you uploaded this , my fellow-dutchman  `` why is the netherlands so rich '' `` why is belgium so boring '' nothing against you guys :p . 
  i 'll have to grand you the different interpretation of his words , my bad . 
  and yes , crimea is a different situation than eastern ukraine . 
  but did the russian soldiers really help with feeling safe , or rather with feeling opressed ? 
  especially since it 's about annexing russia , the fact that there were russian soldiers at the vote offices is , at the very least , dubious . 
  as for eastern ukraine , i suppose i do n't even need to mention the `` covert '' invasion . 
  i mean , the trucks of food supplied . 
  right ? 
  i do n't agree with the analogy , but the fact that putin mentioned it can be in kiev within 2 weeks if it wanted , after annexing crimea , is not really sign of friendly diplomacy , to say the least . 
  oh , yeah , forgot to add the source !, 
  it was wikipedia , though ( and imf ) . 
  i just calculated the population , gdp , etc by adding them up for all three nations , and then compared them with similar countries . 
  so for example , 28.6 million people is less than uzbekistan , but more than nepal . 
  but in case you do n't know the population of uzbekistan of nepal that well , the single one country with a higher population or respectively lower population are malaysia and respectively ghana . 
  and if even that does n't help , i included a third , venezuela and afghanistan .
