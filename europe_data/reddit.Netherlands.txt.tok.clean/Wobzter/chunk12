   if they are n't willing to reform without direct eu membership as a result than maybe they are not worth the trouble . 
  this is a very good point . 
  so how about ... just a silly suggestion here ... presenting ukraine at least with the possibility to one day become an eu-member state ? 
  how else can we know if they 're willing to reform for the eu ? 
   that makes me think : what has ukraine to offer the eu ? 
  besides lots of minerals , it is also has a huge agricultural power which , with the right investment , could make it the bread-maker of europe . 
  in fact , if it was part of the eu it would have the second largest reserve of uranium ( [ after estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_uranium_reserves#/media/file:uranium_reserves.png ) ) , the [ largest manganese production ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_manganese_production ) , the [ largest iron ore production ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_iron_ore_production ) and the [ largest titanium production ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_titanium_production ) among other things . 
  call it whatever you want it , but you and i both know that if it was n't for russian military support and media control it would 've never happened . 
  you first have to make the people believe prosperity is within reach . 
  you do this by making closer ties ( such as with an association agreement ) . 
  already in ukraine they are reforming the police system in the larger cities to fight corruption - because there 's a common belief that it 'll be necessary to get closer to the eu . 
  if we say `` no '' on the association agreement , the risk is that they 'll feel their efforts were in vain and they 'll go right back to where they were . 
  you do n't help out someone by telling them `` come back to me when you 've dealt with your depression , we can become friends then '' . 
  no , you help them by being there for them in their time of need . 
  i invite all romanians to shed more light on this . 
  for now : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_corruption_scandals_in_romania all conviction dates are from 2010 and beyond , 3 years after their accession to the eu . 
  meanwhile , [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_in_romania ) we read that although it is still a big problem , due to pressure from the eu there has been a gradual change towards fighting corruption , with an anti-corruption brigade being enforced in 2014 . 
  well , looking at other eastern european countries , it 's exactly the ( possible ) accession to the european union which brought down their corruption rates . 
  suddenly there was an outside incentive to work on it . 
  looking at how ukraine and russia are now , i can see that . 
  then again , in 1989 no one would 've expected poland to join the eu 15 years later . 
  things can change dramatically . 
  i would n't consider syria a civil war anymore . 
  there are like 10 different groups fighting for control , half of which are not even from the lands they fight in . 
  it 's simply an all-out-war which started as a civil war . 
  in which case you agree that russia is directly involved with the fighting which has happened in eastern ukraine , which means it 's not a civil war anymore . 
  whether he 's a good guy does n't change the apparent fact that the previous president was only elected in rigged elections . 
  if there is proof that the same thing happened with the current president , i would n't be surprised ( or even condone ) another uprising . 
  and is n't it ultimately the right of the people to rise up against the president if they feel like their ideas are no longer represented ? 
  in most history books the french revolution is seen as a good thing , despite the blood shed . 
  and this revolution saw relatively little bloodshed . 
  i love how the old lady still referred to the balkan states as `` yugoslavia '' , haha . 
  but yeah , no surprise . 
  in argentina as well . 
  in order to enter the national park iguaz\u00fa as foreigner my parents paid more than i did because i had a residence permit there ( being a student there ) . 
  so will ireland , the netherlands and luxembourg be added to that list ? 
  i mean , he at least took the time to look up information and make a conclusion out of that . 
  in his case i would say it 's a mix of limited and biased research and a feeling of superiority which made him vote no . 
  i would consider it misinformed ... but still informed . 
  i mean , the democratic process has tactical voting inherently in it . 
  so i decided to make use of that . 
  the sad thing ... it is . 
  i believe the majority of the votes were not against ukraine , but against the eu . 
  i would n't even be surprised if half them voting `` no '' ca n't even pinpoint ukraine on a map . 
  keep in mind that only 1/3rd of the people voted . 
  the majority of the people realize that this is about ukraine ... but they also realize they know too little about it . 
  so they do n't vote . 
  and then of course there 's the group which wanted to vote yes , but did n't in order to stay below the 30 % baseline ( which failed ) . 
  all in all , the outcome of this referendum is dictated by uninformed opinions from people who just want to rebel against the eu . 
  so yeah ... op can pinpoint ukraine on a map ( i assume ) , understands what the association agreement is and did n't vote no because he 's against the eu . 
  that is already more informed than the majority of his peer no-voters . 
  i 'm sorry for my fellow dutchmen who think either they know what 's happening in ukraine better than the ukrainians themselves or simply voted against the eu . 
  after all , being western means having access to * all * information and this information is only available to us ... * obviously * . 
  / s i abstained from voting because i did n't want it to reach the 30 % baseline , because most of the people ( excluding op here ) were voting not on ukraine , but on the eu . 
  not only do i disagree with voting against the eu , i also disagree with this `` proxy referendum '' . 
  i am at least glad op decided to look into the ukraine situation , rather than merely voting against the eu . 
  that said , knowing the effect of the eu on eastern european countries as a source of hope and an incentive to reform , i am definitely in favour of closer ties between ukraine and the eu . 
  i would have voted in favour if the chance of a majority yes would be bigger than a 30 % - baseline not reached . 
  op , i am genuinely happy you at least took the time to consider ukraine , rather than simply parroting `` det hep ik op feesboek gelesuh '' ( for non-dutchies , it 's a low-educated way of saying `` i saw it on facebook , so it must be true '' ) . 
  obviously i disagree with your opinion , but i am genuinely happy you formed an actual opinion on the matter of the referendum . 
  i 'm also happy you come here to defend your opinion , for the sake of better understanding each other . 
  i still disagree though , haha . 
  i heard a similar story in the vice coverage on the ukrainian conflict . 
  the referendum was still poorly executed ( with ( pro- ) russian military guards at every entrance ) - but i do believe that a majority would 've been in favour . 
  probably not as high as the number that they published , but still above 50 % . 
  maybe even above 67 % . 
  anyway , funny thing that russia is annexing crimea because of their `` right to self-determination '' when they themselves have quite some issues with it in the caucasus region . 
  people are more upset about the eu than russia ... as this referendum quite shows ... : /, 
  only the most vocal ones . 
  most of the people who voted in this referendum are just poorly informed and use this to show their discontent with the eu . 
  at least ; that is my observation . 
  i mean , assuming there would be no deal at all is just ridiculous and i feel like you should automatically ignore everything a person says after that made such a stupid statement . 
  that said , it will of course have dire impacts on the economy . 
  companies which have their base in london now for their eu-headquarters will have to move it . 
  certain trade will inadversibly be affected . 
  a recession will most likely happen . 
  the scale of it may often be exaggerated , though . 
   what the hell ? 
  how can a pro-life person be satisfied by this fictional middle ground ? 
  `` you 're killing babies ! '', 
  how can a pro-choice person be satisfied by this fictional middle ground ? 
  `` you 're preventing choice ! '', 
  i never said people will be satisfied . 
  in a country where people have two opposing ideas , there will never be true satisfaction . 
  it 's impossible to achieve that . 
  taking myself ( pro-choice ) as an example , i would much rather live in a country where victims of rape can , rather than can not get an abortion . 
  it 'll be no surprise that i want everyone to have that option , but i will be * more * satisfied with this ( what i call ) middle ground , than i would be with no abortions whatsoever . 
  again . 
  do not think that i am entirely satisfied . 
  but nonetheless , i do prefer this ` middle ground ' over no abortions at all . 
  what you 're suggesting is that people can only have two moods : satisfied or unsatisfied . 
  people have a vast array of moods . 
  politicians would much rather have semi-satisfied people than unsatisfied people , right ? 
  well , with the abortion-in-case-of-rape law he will have me being semi-satisfied rather than unsatisfied . 
  at the same time there are many pro-life people out there who are semi-satisfied with this as well . 
  obviously it will depend on the culture and the time , but in some places the ` sum of satisfaction ' is highest when taking this ` middle ground ' ( assuming satisfaction = 1 , semi-satisfaction = 0.5 and dissatisfaction = 0 ) . 
  not in all places , though . 
  that 's why laws are different among all countries . 
   `` ask someone you 're about to kill whether they prefer the fast or the slow death . '', 
  this is a false choice dilemma .
