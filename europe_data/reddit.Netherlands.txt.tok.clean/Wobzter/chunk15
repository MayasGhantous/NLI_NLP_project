  after all , the other day i was at the bar and i heard two people talk about reddit . 
  so reddit is obviously representative of society . 
  sure , but they are the hole at the center of eu maps ... 
  so many somalis go to ethiopia to claim asylum in europe . 
  why not just stay in ethiopia ? 
  you are right ... 
  it does n't change the fact that germany will need work force , and spain needs work . 
  now you could argue that spanish people should move to germany , and that 's fine . 
  but the truth is , they are not the ones moving despite having the legal issues in their favour as europeans . 
  i 'm talking about germany which has a flourishing economy based on people who will retire within the coming decades . 
  i 'm not talking about spain or greece . 
  i can do the math . 
  can you make the connection ? 
  i guess no one denies immigration has bad things related to it . 
  but there are also good things . 
  germany will need the extra work force in a few decades . 
  obviously they also need to work on making sure they integrate correctly , but the workforce is needed . 
  we 're like a zombie to the sea : not only did we murder the sea , we also made it become one of our own . 
  what is the worst grade over there ? 
  in germany it 's a 6 ... talk about a -- unique -- grading -- system . 
  cyrillic is the easiest part in my opinion . 
  you can learn that in 20 hours and get straight 10s ( 20s for you silly french people and 1s for you silly german people ) . 
   ariane 5 had two failures and two partial failures in its first 28 launches . 
  in fact , it had all those in its first 14 launches . 
  it seems you 're right . 
  those 73 successes and zero failures are only the most recent 73 flights . 
  not the full 88 launches . 
   falcon 9 had one partial failure and one failure in its 28 launches so far . 
  again you 're right . 
  i included one failure which never reached the launching stage ( amos-6 ) . 
  three actually . 
  but alas , that was in the 1980s . 
  i 'm not sure how significant that data is now . 
  you could argue that russia reached the moon first , so for moon missions we ought to be with the russians . 
  but realistically we look at the data of the past 10-20 years at maximum . 
  i was wondering how true this is . 
  and it very much is . 
  [ ariane 5 has had 73 successes and no failures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ariane_launches ) while the [ falcon 9 had 26 successes , one part-success and two failures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_falcon_9_and_falcon_heavy_launches#launch_statistics ) . 
  i have n't used fortran yet , but i 'm well-versed in matlab . 
  thanks for the feedback , by the way . 
  that 's definitely nice !, 
  i 'll soon be starting my master 's thesis ( here in delft ) , and as i getting a better understanding of what i want for my phd exactly i 'll definitely consider ceitec nano in brno . 
  thanks a bunch !, 
  what program do you use ? 
  i actually took a course on how to use adf . 
  what is your university ? 
  i was actually looking into doing my phd in a country like czech republic . 
  however , i could n't find much research to be done in the quantum nano-science which really made my spider senses tingle . 
  i still have a year or so to look around though . 
  if i understand correctly a large portion of the european turks are conservatives . 
  right now with a conservative turkish government , there is an incentive for the government to keep the conservatism up . 
  that said , there are still many progressive turks in turkey - perhaps more so than progressive arabs in saudi arabia . 
  so if i understand correctly this makes it such that countries like my own will not be tax havens anymore ? 
  is so , then this is a positive thing !, 
  he obviously still wants istanbul to be called constatinople , and israel to be called mandatory palenstine . 
  i 'm not into guys , but boy am i not into croatiam guys after reading this . 
  i know right . 
  let 's complain about it on these internet sites which are only a decade old like reddit and facebook using our newest iphone or tablet while commuting in a hybrid bus which may use integrated systems to avoid traffic jams , as next to us we hear a kid talk about putting his phone in a small drone to reach places in order to catch pok\u00e9mon , and next to him is an old granny reading books on her e-reader as her husband is watching a series on netflix using a 4g-network . 
  yeah . 
  you 're right . 
  our countries have really stagnated . 
  in terms of fruits and vegetables i 'm not surprised . 
  i currently live near a jumbo , which has more variety . 
  but yeah , our variety comes more in the other things which are boxed . 
  these are called `` scharreleieren '' , which is basically from chicken who live with like 200 in 1 m ^ 2 . 
  not the most chicken-friendly . 
  but hey , cheap eggs !, 
  upvote this if you 're reading this in 2016 !, 
  the difference is that a burqa covers almost the entire face . 
  since people use faces to convey important information and a `` sense of humanity '' , forcing women to wear burqas restricts these rights to women and makes it easier to regard them as `` objects '' ( it 's easier to kill an animal with no face , than one who looks very scared at you ) . 
  the burkini does not cover the face . 
  not anymore . 
  or fiji has recently had a lot of tectonic plate movements . 
  i know , i know . 
  but even if things are twice as expensive , it 's still cheaper than the mcdonalds ... 
  i do n't know the prices over there in greece , but over here it 's true what / u/journo127 says . 
  it 's just that being poor makes you crave more for fats and other `` quick energy `` s , hence making you eat more junk food . 
  for example . 
  i can easily spend $ 3 on a healthy meal consisting of soup , rice , some vegetables and a bit of meat : * soup : * water : $ 0.01 * broth : $ 0.10 ( $ 0.79 for 8 bars ) * egg : $ 0.16 ( $ 3.15 for 20 eggs ) * 200g mushrooms : $ 0.64 ( $ 1.28 for 400g ) * main dish : * rice : $ 0.12 ( $ 1.63 for 1 kg ) * 200g mushrooms : $ 0.64 ( $ 1.28 for 400g ) * half a paprika bell : $ 0.23 ( $ 1.39 for 3 ) * 100g chicken : $ 0.75 ( $ 6.75 for 900g ) * spices + costs for gas/electricity : $ 0.25 ( estimate ) total price : $ 3.00 for one person that 's enough for a good dinner . 
  all prices are from www.ah.nl , which is n't even the cheapest supermarket out there !, 
  one point of warrant is that these prices are for bulk products ( 20 eggs , 900g of chicken , 400g mushrooms , 3 paprika bells ) rather than single-portion products . 
  that said , if you have a freezer and a fridge you wo n't have to throw away things and can use it before they expire . 
  make an omellete for lunch with the remaining eggs , for example . 
  or consider putting extra chicken in your soup . 
  another point of warrant is that these the chicken used for the eggs and the chicken meat are considered to be `` unethical '' by some because their lives are awful - not that that 's not the case at mcdonalds or kfc or anything , though . 
  but seriously , eating healthy and cheap is n't that difficult . 
  what is difficult is spending the mental and physical effort to make it happen , especially when you 're craving for fats and high-energy products . 
  because being a rapist is such an emotionally charged term that people sometimes respond irrationally ( and genuinely will think bad of ** the person behind elemmiretulcakelumes 's account ** ) , thus allowing schurkjeboefje to make ** the person behind elemmiretulcakelumes 's account ** 's life worse for a long time . 
  we could argue whether any deliberate action against another person meant to cause harm , perhaps long-lasting , should be allowed by law . 
  and seriously , we might actually argue that . 
  is there a way to make them pay for the extra cost of global warming in the coming centuries ? 
  i was just about to post this :  at the referendum on the 6th of april 2016 61 % of the dutch population voted no . 
  apparently the 32 % people who voted are equal to the entire dutch population . 
  interesting . 
  the more you know !, 
   it 's a question that needs to be asked but why should i be asking it ? 
  well , technically i did the asking ( for the majority of the questions , but you started it initially ) . 
  you make a good point about that some people are less responsible than some ( most ? ), 
  16-year olds . 
  it 's a valid question .
