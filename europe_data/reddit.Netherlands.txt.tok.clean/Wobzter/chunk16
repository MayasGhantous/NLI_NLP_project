  in brazil , for example , you * are * allowed as of 16 . 
  for everybody 18 and above you are obliged to vote . 
  another thing where there 's no clear-cut answer : should 50 % of the voters choose `` change the status quo '' or 50 % of the people who are allowed to vote . 
  because now 37.5 % of the people voted `` leave the eu '' , determining the fate for the remaining 62.5 % . 
  of course , you could argue that those who did n't vote implicitly agreed with without outcome there is as it 's `` the rules of the game '' . 
  but that 's the whole point : these rules are somewhat arbitrary but need to be made . 
  we can discuss about it . 
  in fact , i think we should . 
  i find it a bit unfortunate this conversation got a bit out of hand due to snarky messages back and forth . 
  that said , i do think the limit should not be below 16 . 
  whether it 's 16 , 17 or 18 i 'm not sure of yet . 
  -- what age do you think is right ? 
  what do you think of elderly people voting ? 
  what about the terminally ill ? 
  the illiterate ? 
  the ones who do n't speak nor understand the official language ? 
  what do you think about the margin required to change something as significant as this ? 
  should it be 50 % +1 of the voters ? 
  55 % of the voters ? 
  an x % of all those who are allowed to vote ? 
  and why ? 
  what do you think of mandatory voting ? 
  tough question . 
  but we 'll get the oil and the appreciative people , right ? 
  i 'm not denying that . 
  but in terms `` societal impact '' , a referendum with 72 % turn-up about being part of the eu will have a lot more watching and demanding eyes than a referendum with a 32 % turn-up about an association agreement between the eu and ukraine . 
  i 'm talking about society , not ` the rules of the game ' . 
  that 's what i feel like as well . 
  technically they 're not against scotland entering the eu , they ( and i mean some politicians in madrid ) are against scotland seceding . 
  one of the reasons scotland wanted to secede is its stance with the eu ( as is evident in this referendum ) . 
  spain wanted to take that argument away to avoid scotland from seceding ( and giving catalonia ideas ) . 
  they were trying to put pressure on scotland not to secede from the uk because of their own secession movements . 
  when push comes to shove and scotland is already independent , i doubt they 'll want be against it . 
  to be fair , voter turnout was only around 32 % there , whereas this is 72 % . 
  i ca n't think of any eu member being against scotland entering the eu . 
  edit : regarding spain , it was an obvious point of pressure to avoid scotland from seceding because of the catalan secession movement . 
  of course a * welsh * would say that !, 
  ( apparently , i mean , i did n't know it was a welsh thing to say until an hour ago ), 
  as a european , could you give me some reasons why texas should stay ? 
  that requires them to really want to leave the eu , though . 
  well , wales is also in favour of leave ( which seems to be the outcome now ) . 
  scotland on the other hand ... there is no constituency with a majority leave . 
  they also have a 62 % remain result . 
  it could . 
  but why not just go with the eec , where most of its trade is already happening anyway ? 
  ukraine , moldova and some balkan countries are still interested , as is iceland again . 
  i guess both are childish ( the reactions you 're referring to and your own comments here ) . 
  hey , i 'm not saying it does n't make sense to stop at the country level , especially in the uk . 
  i 'm just saying that the dividing line is still subjective . 
  so when you blame them for `` giving up their sovereignty '' you might run into a senseless discussion , because your ideas about where the dividing line is are different . 
  also , northern ireland is not on the same island . 
  sure , england places enough protestants there at the time to make it ` culturally english ' - but it has still developed its own culture . 
  now you 're sco'ish enough to come here :d . 
  i 'd like the uk to leave , scotland to split off and rejoin and watch england go through some trouble and then crawl back . 
  yes , i 'm an awful person . 
  exactly , that is indeed my point . 
  and it makes sense that to most it 's the country they live in . 
  but that 's not the case for everyone . 
  in fact , the uk is already an exception to that , because most of the sovereignity lies not with the country ( england , scotland , wales or n. ireland ) but with the political union the united kingdom . 
  sorry , not scottish enough . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ which ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ means ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ normal , ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ worry . 
  [ let 's find out . 
  sounds about right , indeed ... 
  but you get my point , right ? 
  i live in an appartment in delft , part of the den haag region which is part of the province of zuid-holland , which is part of holland , which is part of the netherlands which is part of the benelux which is part of the eu . 
  when i 'm talking about `` my sovereignty '' , i could pick any of those communities . 
  why would i give `` my sovereignity '' to someone politician living in den haag , instead of in delft ? 
  a similar question you 're asking now from your fellow englishmen about the eu . 
  of course , history and culture comes into play . 
  but the definition of `` one 's sovereignty '' is defined quite poorly . 
  you consider `` your sovereignty '' to be the confines of the uk . 
  others consider it the confines of the eu ( and others might argue that it 's the confines of just scotland , or maybe even just the city of glasglow , for example ) . 
  as long as you have a nice scottish accent , you 're welcome here !, 
  well , let 's consider the time-span it which it will leave . 
  it 'll probably take more than a year . 
  looking at the exchange rates as well ... this just feels like i 'm looking at a poor man stabbing himself . 
  ( assuming you do n't live in london ) : why would you ever give your sovereignty to someone politician living in london ? 
  because you trust them and identify with the country which includes you . 
  i 'll bet you that there are in fact people who trust the eu and identify with being part of the eu . 
  is it bad that i laughed while reading this ? 
  i mean , it 's not like we 're not bombarded with `` german made mistakes during the second world war '' over and over to the point where as soon as you say `` hitler '' you ca n't have a normal discussion anymore . 
  well sure . 
  but that is not the `` take took our jobs '' - statement i was replying to . 
  that 's a different problem on it 's own . 
  that said , it is a problem , yes . 
  and for some of them it 's hard to solve . 
  as the article said , a majority of the ( non-moroccan and non-turkish and non-western ) immigrants are asylum seekers . 
  they are that because of a reason , which correlates with their difficulty to get a job . 
  it 's definitely a problem which needs to be addressed more seriously . 
  but it is not a problem of ` they took our jobs ' . 
  are there actual statistics about that ? 
  i 'd like to see them . 
  obviously `` i lost my job because of migrants '' will be heard louder than `` i got a job '' . 
  so besides of media attention , i 'm curious about the actual statistics . 
  personally , i do n't think it is necessarily bad . 
  i think the article was making more of a point that it is about english nationalism , disguised as euroscepticism . 
  that said , nationalism ( or perhaps more importantly : expansionism led by nationalism ) did cause `` quite some friction '' in the past though . 
  interestingly the unemployment rates in both the uk and germany are almost historically low - despite `` migrants taking their jobs '' . 
  like the easyjet airplane :p ? 
  that wo n't happen ever again .
