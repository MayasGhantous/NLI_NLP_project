  the advantage is that most of it in shallow water . 
  while we 're on the subject , how viable would a track from stockholm to turku be , going through \u00c2land and the whole archipelago there ? 
  it would literally open up the way from stockholm to helsinki . 
  once tallinn and helsinki are connected ; it would also open up the way from stockholm to tallinn without a lot of detours . 
  you mentioned you thought bucharest would be older than 555 years , because it 's in romania , which is inhabited long before the netherlands were inhabited . 
  so you make the relation : [ 1 ] inhabitance of a location --  [ 2 ] city at said location . 
  since we know that [ 1 ] happened earlier in romania than in the netherlands , you assumed that [ 2 ] would happen earlier in romania as well , right ? 
  my point is that the following stronger relation holds true : [ 1 ] inhabitance of a location --  [ 1.5 ] civilization at said location --  [ 2 ] city at said location . 
  you can not expect to make a city when you do n't even know the right construction techniques , when you do n't have a surplus in food leading in a large amount of people and different professions ( including architect , construction worker , etc. ) ... 
  i.e. , you can not expect to make a city when you do n't have at least some form of civilization ; be it a local one of not . 
  now , with the relation [ 1 ] --  [ 1.5 ] --  [ 2 ] i just sketched , my point is that although [ 1 ] may have happened earlier in romania rather than the netherlands , there is an intermediate point [ 1.5 ] which both the netherlands and romania reach , before going to [ 2 ] . 
  ** as an analogy ** , suppose you moved exampleville in the year 1980 [ 1 ] . 
  meanwhile , i moved to exampleville in the year 1982 [ 1 ] . 
  in the year 1990 the mayor asks everybody to sign up a form to indicate whether they want broadband internet [ 1.5 ] . 
  then in the year 1991 [ 2 ] he starts introducing these connections all over exampleville , with implementation taking up to 1992 . 
  you may have moved to exampleville earlier than i did ( like people lived in romania earlier than in the netherlands ) , but what matters is whether you signed in the form to receive broadband ( like it matters that you have a civilization ) . 
  from that point on it 's random again , dependent on which region the mayor decides to improve first ( just like the sprawl of larger and sustainable cities is , to some extent , random as well ) . 
  without having filled in the form , it does n't matter whether you or i moved to exampleville first . 
  similarly , without having a civilization , it does n't matter whether people settled in romania or the netherlands first . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : you need a civilization to make sustainable cities . 
  immigration to a region does not equal civilization . 
  obviously , but that 's about 30.000 years ago ( [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_human_migrations#migration_of_the_cro-magnons_into_europe ) ) . 
  civilizations ( as we consider them now ) in europe did not emerge before 10.000 years ago ( [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neolithic_europe ) ) . 
  meanwhile , constructions sprawled all around europe over time , with western europe being earlier ( or better preserved ) than eastern europe ( [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_oldest_buildings_in_the_world#by_age ) ) . 
  finally , continuous settlement did not arrive from a certain location . 
  and if it did , data suggests it originated from england , in europe ( [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_by_time_of_continuous_habitation#europe ) ) . 
  the world was already populated all over before the advent of civilizations . 
  long before the people in the lower countries settled to make large cities . 
  ftfy, 
  headline : people interested in other cultures are more likely to date somebody from a different culture . 
  zuid-holland here as well . 
  i like the country exactly how it is . 
  we 're all speaking one and the same language and the ns covers both the east and the west . 
  ( ns being the biggest railway company ) . 
  and i even like our little frisian province with their silly people claiming they want more autonomy . 
  ( to put it in perspective , only a select portion wants this , the majority does n't ) . 
  i 'll have to agree with you . 
  there are just some frisian people who went there to look at arguments given back and forth . 
  these few people want more autonomy . 
  i forgot the name of the group , though . 
  scotland was given an opportunity to vote . 
  crimea was denied any form of self-governance , despite their population being about 60 % russian , rather than ukrainian . 
  they tried a vote in 1993 as well , but it did n't get recognized because ukraine does n't want to give it up . 
  my question was the address : to what extent does the right to self-determination apply ? 
  number one priority in what way ? 
  i support of secession , or to oppose ? 
  in a similar note , how do you feel about the situation in crimea and , seperately , eastern ukraine ? 
  hence he mentions it should be done transparent . 
  if it 's done transparent than you can easily which politicians fall prey to the argument of money and which do n't . 
  it will , however , always be true that specialists will know more about an issue than a politician and so it 's up to a politician to hear to what specialists have to say . 
  i believe he meant that this kind of lobbying is good . 
  now here 's map ( roughly ) without russia , just to show the portion of the europe which is solely russia . 
  atleast something will finally `` go above groningen '' . 
  commenting this just to show agreement . 
  and now compare it by their average gdp . 
  nederland.fm and then either q-music or skyradio . 
  * native dutch * c2 english * b1 german * b1 spanish * a2 french * a1 portuguese ( but learning , for my brazilian girlfriend ), 
  is it oppression to put someone in jail for killing someone else ? 
  is it oppression to make the use of ( hard ) drugs illegal ? 
  is it oppression to stop people from claiming whatever piece of land they desire ? 
  to exemplify : is it oppression by the dutch government if i want to make my garden wobzter 's republic of wobztertopia ? 
  it 's not easy getting a referendum when your government is corrupt . 
  still , they should 've sought a platform for diplomacy , not this . 
  furthermore , only about 50 % of the people there want to be independent ; i think the numbers in kosovo are way higher . 
  passing on this subthread to the next dutchie . 
  so you 're saying what 's happening in the east ( people claiming their republic because they feel russian ( foreign ) , rather than ukrainian ( native ) ) is case # 1 because russians are , according to you , native . 
  you say `` since the days when there were no distinctions between the two people 's '' . 
  what times are you talking about ? 
  or some more recent data , perhaps : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ethnicrussiansintheformerussr.png that 's 1994 . 
  in the donetsk people 's republic we got this group : pink : 20.0 % -34.9 % . 
  so around 1900 they were a minority . 
  in 1994 they were a minority . 
  or what times are you talking about when they were one and the same group ? 
  how far do you want to go back before you reach a russian majority to justify that `` russians are native '' ? 
  my point is , you can find all sorts of ambiguous reasons why russians are native there . 
  but they are ambiguous and people will always disagree on how far you look back . 
  what we have right now are the current international borders , laws and people . 
  why not work from there on ? 
  `` foreign to the land they are living in '' . 
  i see ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ethnic-ukrainians.jpg you mean like the russian in the donetsk people 's republic ? 
  like the russians in crimea ? 
  or do people need to live there for a certain amount of years before they are not foreign any more ? 
  because that would be a great tactic to claim another country . 
  just think of all the chinese people working just across the russian border . 
  china can claim that land within a couple of decades !, 
  that depends on the definition of ethnic group . 
  anyway , so apparently the type of group matters to you . 
  what types of groups do have the right to self determination , and which do n't ? 
  if we use `` ethnic '' in the sense most people use it , consider this : in the hague ( netherlands ) , there is a borough where the majority are not dutch . 
  http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/schilderswijk_%28den_haag%29#demografie would the people in this borough have the right to claim it part of turkey or morroco ? 
  i mean , the turks and morrocans make up about 50 % of the population , while the dutch make up less than 10 % . 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  would these people be able to claim their territory , in the netherlands ? 
  so not only do you avoid answering my question ( yet you do not avoid replying , so apparently time is not the constraint ) , but you 're also insulting me . 
  you sure seem to be good at discussions . 
  does it mean you 're equally good at making conclusions about worldly events ? 
  `` ethnic self determination '' - and how is isis not trying to determine their own future ? 
  they are an ethnic group , they want their rights . 
  nobody gives them , so they take it by force . 
  sounds familiar ?
