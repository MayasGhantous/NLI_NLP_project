  how do you feel about is ( is ) trying to claim their own piece of land ? 
  and how do you feel about donetsk poeple 's republic militia killing people to claim their own piece of land ? 
  i do n't like the song either . 
  the lyrics are historic , so i 'll leave them at that . 
  but the music , i do n't like it , either . 
  one of the things people are unhappy about over here is related to some statistics we hear about your style of living . 
  i 'm not sure how true they are , but to exemplify : you have pensions at the age of 56 ( as opposed to 65 over here , which is currently changing to 67 ) . 
  if you work at the government ( i think they meant parliament ) , no matter how for how long , you get a life-long income for your service ( though it did n't mention how much you 'd get ) . 
  again , i 'm not sure how true they are . 
  but it 's what i 've heard several times over here . 
  and these things are naturally very expensive for the government . 
  edit : decided to look it up . 
  the whole retirement age seems like it 's made up . 
  on wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/retirement_age i find 60-67 ( how does that work ? ), 
  for women and 67 for men . 
   i remember saving a low-res version of it some years ago . 
  interesting , considering croatia is only member for a bit longer than a year . 
  and is there proof that western-raised jihadists do that ? 
  from what i know , that 's mostly done by middle-eastern-raised jihadists ( you know , the ones who grew up being bombed by western nations ) . 
  would a death sentence suit better ? 
  i mean , why not kill all american soldiers who invaded iraq because they had `` weapons of mass destruction '' ? 
  that is equally well terrorism , just accepted by the mass population because the majority was in favour , rather than the minority . 
  because confused people in their mid-twenties who are struggling with integration and assimilation of parents ' culture are branded for life . 
  totally legit . 
  and yet this uber-liberal bullshit has allowed our country to have one of the lowest levels of people going into jail more than once ( i.e. 
  return ratios are low ) . 
  heck , we even have to close cells because there are too few people to fill them . 
  now i 'm not really sure what your non-uber liberal method would be , but your country does not have the best statistics when it comes to arresting people . 
  unless you consider it a good thing that about 1 % of your population is in prison , of course . 
  people are either like `` fuck putin '' or `` stop these sanction wars '' ( which is to say `` fuck putin , fuck the eu '' ) . 
  either way , it 's `` fuck putin '' . 
  you meant to make the same point before me ? 
   would n't a flag make it easier to identify instead of solely having the country codes ( i mean some are not what you would expect them to be ) i find it much easier to tell a police officer `` the country said irl '' rather than saying having the discussion `` it was an italian car '' - `` how do you know ? '', 
  - `` it had this flag with 3 vertical stripes , the middle one was white and the right one was orange and the left one was green . '', 
  - `` eh , sir ... '', 
  a summary of all the suggestions i 've read so far : 1 . 
  the line oslo - helsinki can be extended to st. petersburg . 
  concerning price/time considerations , this can be done over the existing talinn-st . petersburg line . 
  this can then potentially be extended to moscow . 
  2 . this same line can also be extended from oslo to bergen ; it 's the end of the line , so you 're not really letting other people take longer . 
  geneva has to be included ; it 's geneva . 
  suggestions are to make red go through strasbourg - zurich - ( basel/bern ? ), 
  personally i think the zurich-detour is unnecessary . 
  4 . http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=jpvvbc&amp;s=8#.u_emklvn4xa but i think these include too many small lines . 
  perhaps the small lines are better done by local train companies ? 
  time . 
  either in between each station , or in between each hub . 
  he actually sound counties , not countries . 
  that said , i agree with thejgamer : dutch ? 
  perhaps belgian . 
  let 's not forget benelux , please  . 
   that or a single rt report . 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/18/sara-firth-resigns-russia-today-lies-anchor_n_5598815.html well , if rt is so holy to you . 
  they admitted they are lying and their first rule is to blame ukraine . 
  cool . 
  you and daysleeperrr should work together on stuff from now on :p . 
  nor do i think maastricht ( 120k ) is a sizeable enough city , compared to liege ( 200k ) and aachen ( 240k ) . 
  besides , the heerlen area ( 240k ) is closer to aachen than it is to maastricht . 
  of course , currently it 's easier to go with the ns than to use eurorail or whatever connects heerlen with aachen , but we 're talking about future . 
  your line from moscow to kiev could be extended to lviv and then to warsaw . 
  when going from athens to st. petersburg , why stop 13 times in the middle , when you could only stop once in budapest ? 
  ... yeah . 
  i think , for people in the netherlands , an amsterdam - brussels - london ( skipping paris ) would save quite a long time ; even for high speed rails . 
  besides , you 're dutch , you might see the benefit in this :p . it could go over ghent and would also serve people on the marine blue track ( from warsaw ) . 
  brussels - liege - aachen - cologne i think that 's a fair one . 
  that 's really cool . 
  i think a tunnel like that would be really great . 
  i just hope it 'll become a success like the english channel tunnel . 
  anyway , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rail_baltica#mediaviewer/file:railbaltica.png ; a diverge at riga or tartu is still possible , right ? 
  might as well do st. petersburg to stockholm . 
  i also think it 'd make more sense for the athens - st. petersburg diverges from amsterdam - helsinki at tartu . 
  that could save quite some time . 
  on a similar note , it would make more sense for both lines to go straight from kaunus to riga , and include a new line kaunus - vilnius - minsk - ( smolensk ) - moscow . 
  or maybe create a triangle there ... 
  cool , you updated your previous map !, 
  if you plan to show the public your trucks , why not show them trucks loaded with actual humanitarian aid , rather than empty space for potential soldiers to be carried ? 
  i 'm not accusing them of shipping soldiers , but showing only these trucks , out of all possible trucks , is not particularly showing a goodness of intent . 
  humanitarian aid is more important than leaving some trucks in the aftermath of saving people ; so why not show the public your best trucks ? 
  they are stopped at the border anyway , might as well have taken the time to look at them and avoid any accusation from the west . 
  i like how you visited the ijsselmeer : https://goo.gl/maps/cxnq6, 
  in my opinion it means having gone to the location for the purpose of being at the location ; not for driving through . 
  when you spend a night at a hotel while traveling , it 'll only count if you take the effort to explore the city during the evening or following morning/day . 
  but i think most people are more `` liberal '' with their maps . 
  why do n't we just sell limburg to belgium ? 
  that way we can compete on being the lowest in elevation !, 
  i mean , we 're the netherlands . 
  we 're supposed to win this thing !, 
  look , i know that there 's no technical difference between spanish simpsons and english simpsons ( besides of the fact that some puns are `` original '' and others are `` made by translators ; i.e. , not matt groening ) ) ; but this thread is about the percentage of people being able to hold a conversation in english . 
  and this is affected by the language of the dub . 
  since most cartoons on our tv come to us from the us ( whether or not the original content may actually be japanese ) , we can define `` original '' as the `` raw us version '' and `` dubbed '' as `` translated version '' . 
  of course both are dubbed , but it was the point the guy was trying to make . 
  you forget the point ; it 's done in the english language , which is not belgium 's native language . 
  do n't they check your passport with a list of people eligible to vote in your region ? 
  does n't seem like that big of a secret to me ... 
  i 'd like to add on that , as a matter of russia/economic integration an integration of energy policies .

  i interpreted it like : a : x is true , but barely b : x is likely to be true ( rather than a is likely to be true ) . 
  i see you 're using mathematical notation , so the following should be understandable : it is not true that b \\ subsection a. 
  furthermore , whether the conjunction of `` x is true , but barely '' and `` x is likely to be true '' would yield `` x is likely to be true , and if it is , it is only barely true '' .
