  from what i hear in the netherlands , most people are like `` the flemish can join us if they want . 
  we like their education . 
  we can improve their roads . '', 
  - but there 's no real `` desire '' . 
  but your cousin is only 3 months old !, 
  the point he 's trying to make still stands : if your economy shrinks by $ 3 for every $ 1 budget cut , you could argue that it would work the other way around as well : for every $ 1 spend by the government the economy grows by $ 3 . 
  in such a case , the government would be foolish not to spend $ 999999999 and get 3 times as much back . 
  why does n't it do that ? 
  because the 3:1 ratio does n't make sense . 
  people tend to lend money if they see a way to make profit off of it . 
  at very least , they like to not lose money . 
  not having access to your own money for 20 years and then getting all of it back will suck because of inflation . 
  this means you lost money . 
  typically not something you want as a money-lender . 
  because people , be they foreigners or not , are people . 
  ... then that is indeed the case . 
  nothing i can add to that :p . 
  it seems you know more about it then me . 
  can you elaborate on the different clans ? 
  i 've heard there might be an undercover power struggle , but i do n't know that much about it . 
  and i would consider you overly pessimistic , with doubtful evidence . 
  anyway , i hardly think this is going anywhere useful anymore . 
  how should i read your name ? 
  it got me wondering when i / u / ` ed you . 
  or rather like `` lsder gray '' ? 
  well , as long as they do n't have the actual support of the people . 
  it will be hard to sell a open war to their people . 
  if they believe there is an actual threat , or they need to restore their former glory , then there is indeed a much more worrying situation . 
  which is a nice way of saying `` you 're wrong '' , right  ? 
  my point was rather that propaganda usually entails false information spread to the people . 
  and then you come with a very high support rate for putin and assume that this number is true , between all the false information . 
  edit : i thought that was a rather cherry-picked number to suddenly consider to be true . 
  / u/alasdairgray states that people in russia are heavily influenced by propaganda . 
  i agree with him on this point . 
  so much , even , that it would n't surprise me that some numbers in polls and elections are made up ( to account for 140 % , for example ) or that supposed schedules meetings took place during putin 's recent one-week-absent which were shown to be prerecorded . 
  hence , they are not very close to the truth . 
  now he states that the recent ratings show support for putin is at 89 % . 
  since he already states that russian media is not to be trusted ( because it 's using propaganda ) , to what extent can we/he be certain that number is 140 % true ? 
   they are hugely influenced by propaganda  ( putin 's ratings were something like 89 % lately ) i 'll leave the conclusion to you . 
  one can joke whenever they like . 
  it 's going to be disrespectful either way . 
  whether that 's now , a year after the incident , or 10 years from now . 
  but that does n't stop people from enjoying a joke . 
  i kinda doubt that comedian believes ` his ' people are responsible for it , though ... 
  people make jokes about bad things all the time . 
  never heard a hitler joke ? 
  i 've got the feeling this is common in many places . 
  if you believe it 's possible that furries will be normal in 100 years , that means we will need pioneers within the next 100 years . 
  at one point , these people will be more than `` grown-up men stuck with a 10-year old 's mind '' and be actually considered normal . 
  i 'm not saying you / have / to think it 's normal now . 
  look , in your case you actually met the people , so you have evidence to back up your claim . 
  but the other guy plays them off because it 's not normal . 
  if everybody does so , there will be little hope for it ever being considered `` normal '' . 
  / r/polandball, 
  playing ball games is so engrained in our society as `` normal '' for adults . 
  dressing up has always had a sense of `` normal '' for adults , especially for those working with arts/theatre . 
  somehow sports got accepted outside of the profession , but dressing up did n't . 
  since you 're one of the people who feels this way , care to explain why this is ? 
  i agree with you . 
  to be honest , i 'm not sure how proud you should be of how varied your bread is ... 
  but perhaps my taste as a dutch-man is different . 
  ( not perhaps ), 
  and if you 're in the netherlands , they 'll ask you if you want garlic and chili sauce on it . 
  literally . 
  joining in line for the `` dutch people who like prague '' . 
  the u/je distinction is common to many languages ( english is more the exception than the rule ) . 
  on de/het i agree . 
  let 's all make it `` det '' . 
  as a dutchman i agree . 
  but i guess for you it should be relieving to know that what you see is what you hear . 
  i do think non-leather men-purse owners should be excluded ... 
  you called ? 
  i 'n ready to make more polder . 
  give me some wooden shoes , sone weed and a marsh and i 'll turn it into +3 food , +2 gold and +1 hammer . 
  `` and who were you ? 
  '' , the proud lord said , `` that i must bow so low . '', 
  i did n't know the name of island ... 
  i just know copenhagen and roskilde are on it : o. . . ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / u/derpikus, 
  interestingly denmark is missing copenhagen , as well . 
  there 's no caspian sea , either . 
  1000 years of * recorded * war . 
  and a couple of decades . 
  that fact means potentially that you can travel the entire world with and end up back !, 
  so did anybody go to an mep who is in favour of ttip and ask him/her what 's up with this ? 
  or are we all going to complain here ? 
  but they voted on georgia , right ? 
  what 's wrong with tha ... ooh ... 
  i do n't know what it 's like over here either ... 
  there are n't enough homeless people for me to know o.o. . . 
  i thought i ought to know how to pronounce the `` ough '' , though through thorough investigation , it seems quite tough , almost rough , like a cough . 
  to a large degree this is correct , but please do n't mind me being pedantic about your parents having paid taxes before you were born ( and after ) , which in a sizable portion of the population is greater than the things you just mentioned . 
  10 points to gryffindor !, 
  magic is might . 
  ( guess what movie is on tv now ), 
  which would put their population density similar to europe ? 
  remember , aside from big ambitions , we 're a relatively small continent . 
  that said , some of the countries with the highest population density are in europe . 
  do n't you ever have problems signing in at a different computer with that username ? 
  and the exact same could be said about israel ( but instead of kidnapping teenagers , they kill several hundred of them ) . 
  the `` you '' was lithuania .
