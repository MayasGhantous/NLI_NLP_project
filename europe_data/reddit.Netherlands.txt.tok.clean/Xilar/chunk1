when i use it i just say kak . 
   ottoman anatolian ethnic christian and yazidi genocide oaecay genocide ? 
   til there is more than one belgium , and not all of them are ** in ** sane . 
  ftfy, 
  you mean the fact that the french , the italians and the germans ( if you add up the united german team , east - , west - and current germany ) have olympic gold medals than you have ? 
   it does n't affect their lives in almost any discernible way . 
  neither does knowing the countries of europe for a european . 
  maybe every once in a while there will be something with a neighbouring country , but most of the time , you could live without even knowing what 's just over the border . 
  of course vacations are an exception , but if you live in a big country you can go on a vacation there . 
  also , wyoming and delaware are internationally represented by the same government , while czechia and chechnya are n't . 
  to understand what is going on in the world , the difference between countries is generally a lot more important than the difference between their subdivisions . 
  ( i also do n't ever hear anyone expecting people to know where inner mongolia ( hint : it 's not in mongolia ) , xinjiang or sichuan lie . ), 
   moscow quite openly opposes ~ ~ europe ~ ~ ** the eu ** , on the political , cultural and -- in the ukrainian conflict -- military fronts . 
  ( really , since the revolution in 1917 russia has stopped even trying to pretend it 's a european country . ), 
  ftfy europe is a continent , which large parts ( including the capital and the most populated and wealthy areas ) of russia are part of . 
  you ca n't do something about that , neither can the russians . 
  ( technically they could all move to eastern russia , and rebuild their entire society there , but that wo n't happen . ), 
   american universities are no1 . 
  the best american universities are indeed the best of the world ( according to some rankings ) , but i 'm pretty sure that the average american university is n't the better than for example the average dutch university . 
  the american system promotes having some top universities , but also a lot of lesser universities . 
  that is what security is supposed to be against . 
  i do n't think that has got anything to do with religion , just that they are rich and foreign labourers are cheap . 
  there just needs to be a majority of shamed and punished muslims to work ? 
  i do n't know but ... how would any muslim society work if doing work is seen as a punishment and a shame ? 
  i do n't believe that the idea of a muslim society requires a majority of non-muslims to work . 
  were your parents born around of before 1900 ? 
  also , apparently i ca n't read and missed the `` from 100 years ago '' . 
  so i was thinking a bit earlier , but i think it still holds . 
   they transformed millions of young italians , germans and poles into americans pretty well . 
  no , they transformed the grandchildren of italians , germans and poles into italian , german and polish americans . 
  the process of them becoming americans ( and learning english ) took generations . 
  english certainly has the most speakers if you count second speakers . 
  chinese is spoken as a first language by a lot of people , but the amount of people that speak it as a second language is very small . 
  we pay those companies for the infrastructure , and if it is really too expensive than the companies will start charching us more or go out of business . 
  and then we can reclaim more land from the sea to put more aquariums on !, 
   ken effect the only thing i can find when searching for `` ken effect '' is the ken burns effect , which does n't seem relevant at all . 
   best colour choice for danish flag  i agree , though i suggest they add some blue . 
   ue union of europe ? 
  united europe ? 
   recycleren what ? 
  is n't it recycle-en/recycle \u00ebn / recycleen ? 
   sir isaac newton was by any modern standards a religious fanatic . 
  judging historical people by modern standards does n't really work . 
  the real question is what he was by the standards of his time . 
   were 4 crusades towards jerusalem , and there were 204 jihads towards christian lands can you tell me where you found those numbers ? 
  the [ wikipedia page on crusades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jihad#quranic_use_and_arabic_forms ) says historians count `` seven major crusades and several minor ones '' to nine or ten . 
  the crusades are even numbered one through eight ( or nine ) , and that is only including the crusades to the holy land ( not for example the northern crusades and the reconquista ) . 
  also , you are comparing the specific phenomenon of crusades to the much broader term jihad , which literally means striving or struggling , and also includes inner spiritual struggle ( the `` greater jihad '' ) . 
  there have been many more holy wars fought by christians , and based on what you included in your jihad number also by muslims . 
  from what i can find on google translate , they seem to count the days after shabat : two-shabat , three-shabat , four-shabat and five-shabat . 
  dutch and standard german are not dialects of each other , the languages split around the year 600 . 
  the split between the language groups of on one hand dutch and low german and on the other high german even occurred in 100bc . 
  actually i was referring to the fact that libya would still be run by a dictator , which i think most people consider a problem . 
  who is the `` they '' you are referring to ? 
   it would have produced probably problems in the short run but not in the medium and long run for europeans , but the libyans would still have problems . 
  not that i think it would be better than the current situation , but to say that there would n't be any problems is an overstatement . 
  and refugees from syria can just die ? 
  so picture # 1 wo n't happen ? 
   the reason they 're slapping those people is because those people are pedophiles who , once caught , prefer to start playing dumb ( just like you do right now ) and reject rightful criticism , while trying to escape . 
  that 's no excuse to torture them . 
  a lot of criminals wo n't confess , but you can get ( almost ) anyone to confess ( almost ) anything by torturing ( or hurting/slapping , whatever you want to call it ) . 
  that 's why a voluntary confession or good proof is needed . 
  from / u/bob _ in_the_west :  plastic and metal do n't breath so they do n't collect humidity ( meaning they do n't absorb it ) . 
  instead it accumulates on the surface and if it 's cool too then that 's great for mold . 
  we do n't get that much snow , so it 's not really a problem anyway . 
   how do you sleep at night worrying about dying in an earthquake when tons of concrete squashes you like a pancake ? 
  step 1 : do n't live somewhere where ( strong ) earthquakes occur . 
  step 2 : ??? 
  step 3 : profit !, 
  the expression `` huh '' is n't hard to translate at all . 
  it is very international and it has only a few intonation based meanings . 
  on the other hand , take my previous example :  like how in certain languages you mark whether you know something as a fact , whether you witnessed it , or whether you just heard it from someone else . 
  the point is that you have to mark this on the verb . 
  so in what category would a statement like `` last night , the tree next to my house got hit with lightning . '', 
  fall ? 
  maybe i personally witnessed it , but it might be that i slept somewhere else last night and i only heard it from others . 
  by saying this sentence , you do n't give that piece of information , which you need to specify in certain languages . 
  he is talking about the things that can not be expressed in a short way in another language . 
  like how in certain languages you mark whether you know something as a fact , whether you witnessed it , or whether you just heard it from someone else . 
  you ca n't translate that to english without all sentences sounding very weird . 
  and if you do n't translate it , you will miss that information , which might at some point be important . 
  for the most part we do know how it was pronounced based on the languages that it evolved into , explanations on how to pronounce latin by people from that time , spelling mistakes , puns and other things . 
   a country  amsterdam come on !, 
  ditch is obviously superior . 
   \u00d8 ( or minuscule : \u00f8 ) is a vowel and a letter used in the danish , norwegian , faroese and southern sami languages * and in swedish . 
   nope , swedish does n't use \u00f8 . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%98 ) has lied to me !, 
  does this mean something along the lines of '' ... 
  icelandic does n't use the \u00f8 . 
  that 's swedish , danish and norwegian, 
  yes , but i think modern church latin is quite different from ancient vulgar latin , especially in pronunciation . 
   that 's just one difference why every country has their own language and why they are separate languages . 
  what are the other differences , if i may ask ? 
  because different scripts and written intelligibility are n't really good arguments for calling it two languages . 
  otherwise serbian would be two languages . 
  to me it seems more of a political thing to call it different languages . 
  i did n't know there was meat in it . 
  in dutch roosters say kukeleku and dogs say waf or woef . 
  what ? 
  still , you ca n't expect small and poor countries to spend as much as big and rich countries .
