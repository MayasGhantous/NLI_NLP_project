russia is like pretty european, 
  i for one am offended that all of the generaliteitslanden are the same colour . 
  i would have said france but then i went to poland . 
  interesting , sinterklaas was always posed as more of the omniscient being that was watching you at all times , zwarte piet was just sort of there for the strooigoed and the entertainment at the intocht or the school ceremony for me . 
  is a b o r k b o y e, 
  kankerlijer rolls of the tongue real well but has become increasingly controversial as the dutch have continued to become healthier . 
   not frugal what netherlands have you been ? 
  is the problem so bad that you actually need this or is it just a worst case ? 
  why should that exist ? 
  a what ? 
  question to op : have you had such a drill in school , and where did you go to school ? 
  * beacause everyone is hypocritical *, 
  [ the better version ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandballart/comments/4pbf3b/treachery_of_belgium/?st=j5k4j4h2&amp;sh=0080c3ff ), 
   implying not all french people are mimes . 
  [ this one for belgium ] ( https://youtu.be/mtvnmo6crfg ), 
  then why do n't we take pride in our bureaucrats , or teachers , or medical professionals ? 
  quite unusual reasons , and also not things that are very unique to the netherlands . 
  how come ? 
  piek or dukku, 
  i do small pieces of toast with various toppings , mostly `` salades '' and various cheeses and meats . 
  my bassischool ( primary school ) was a `` bijzondere '' ( extraordinairy ? ), 
  montessori-school so it was small even by dutch standards : ~ 180 pupils my middelbare school ( secundary school ) was also quite small , only about 450 pupils , which was probably because it was a gymnasium ( classics school ) only . 
  there was a massive school complex with 2200 students right nextdoor which continually tried to incorporate our school but ultimately failed . 
  the university i am going to has 30374 students which is pretty normal for dutch standards . 
  our dunes tend to catch on fire in summer . 
  turks and autocratic turks, 
  if it 's more than 5c that 's quite strange , it is not unusual to decline small change but i 've never had a vendor straight up assume i do n't want the change back . 
   republic but what about our kings ? 
  finland is the only other place that is equally civilized i believe . 
  bangladesh , antwerpen for a european flag . 
  the only country that is any competition would be finland , but wanting to have grown up there is essentially treason . 
  i 'm just fine with the netherlands thank you very much . 
  i mean so does mine just when i see ty or gy . 
  * no do n't *, 
  i would love for esperanto to take off but it 's not happening without some massive scale top down political push , and i would n't count on that . 
  #f r i e t, 
  honestly the dumbest question i can remember was an american couple who asked me if the water from the drinking fountains was in fact for drinking , but i do n't live in some tourist hotspot or anything so my encounters are limited . 
  is three too many ? 
  this song conincidentally is the top google suggestion for `` belgi\u00eb is '' ( the long form of the song is `` belgie ( is er leven op pluto ) '' . 
  what ? 
  my spoken is a ton better because dislectia mixes very poorly with english 's convoluted orthography . 
  yeah dutch people do tell me that from time to time . 
  how come ? 
  dialect ? 
  spot on . 
  people assume i 'm british all the time . 
  i dig belgian food , but it 's infrastructure and houses disgust me . 
  the great thing about this is that someone definitly has that name by this point . 
  [ not so fast !,

  [ nederland van boven ] ( https://www.vpro.nl/programmas/nederland-van-boven.html ) and its succesor [ onzichtbaar nederland ] ( https://www.vpro.nl/programmas/onzichtbaar-nederland.html ) edit : they are essetially shows about some of the everyday fun things involving geography and how a country like the netherlands keeps going everyday without falling apart . 
  it is , but it is pretty common to just say `` ik ben nederlands '' as well , that might be a dialect thing , it might be just plain wrong , but it feels right to me . 
  is nederlands ook goed ? 
  nope, 
  warm ... 
  i love my home town , but it used to be the `` recessing industrial town '' back in the 60 's and 70 's , and a lot of dutch people still kind of view it as the detroit of the netherlands . 
  yeah but * everything * is in the hague so if you were to regard that as being the de facto capital we would be on the absolute most centralised point on the spectrum . 
  i taught dutch speaking to this eritrean man ( my school had organised for a few students to teach syrian/eritrean refugees who live in the town but did n't get much practice speaking ) it was a good experience overall and most people were very exited to learn the language and intent on making a good impression . 
  my guy however really lost interest after a few weeks and clearly began seeing the lessons as a chore even though he would n't admit it ( to be fair i may have been one of the stricter tutors , but you ca n't just wing it with dutch pronounciation either !, 
  ) , that was slightly demotivating to me , but he still smiles and calls `` hallo ! '', 
  when i see him cycling ( he lives in the town i go to school and he goes to school in the town where i live so we often see each other on the way ) . 
  one of the most surreal experiences of culture shock also occured in these lessons , when one of the eritrean woman , who a freind of mine tutored , was asked about her favourite and least favourite things about the netherlands ; her favourite were bicycles ( this is what intergration into dutch culture looks like people ! ), 
  because they allow her to travel much faster then walking , and her least favourite was , and she uttred this with a straight face `` that you allow gay people to marry '' . 
  everyone just kind of went silent and tried to pretend like nothing had happend after that , because it came as such a surprise . 
  ( in hindsight these people were of course devout christians , but it still catches you of guard because they do n't wear the headscraf like muslims and christianity , unlike islam , is kind of seen as something that has come to fit it with modern dutch values , but i digress . ), 
  the whole ordeal ended quite nicely , the refugee 's threw a big party for all of the language teachers , tutors , and other volunteers , where i ended up eating one of the eritrean dishes completely wrong ( i have since been schooled on proper etheopioan cuisine etiquette ) and the refugees had a laugh about me doing-their-culture-wrong as well . 
  this really calls into question what exactly popular means , as wilders is very popular , but way more hated . 
  i do n't know if that should count as inversely popular or something like that , but hating wilders is probably even more popular than liking him . 
  * this is essentially the dutch equivalent, 
  truely the shenzen of the netherlands !, 
  it was probably founded somewhere in the 11th century and recieved town privileges in 1232 . 
  wageningen ? 
  surely you mean life, 
  [ i c e s k a t i n g ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/speed_skating_at_the_2014_winter_olympics ) also some people like to pretend we are ok at football . 
   serb from modern day croatia well played . 
  a * what * now ? 
  i still think that you do n't quite understand the difference between relative and absolute majoraties correctly , but nevermind . 
  districts and fptp are entirely different and not neciserrely related things , they are just a particulary unfortunate combination that exists in the us , uk , and canada . 
  i think you mean plurality , in this context relative and absolute majority essentially constitute the same thing . 
  mayonaise , [ sat\u00e9 ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/satay ) , and our [ own special kind if curry ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/curry_ketchup ),

  foraging is not a real life skill anymore . 
  i like how his death was pretty meta .

  i thought this was an exclusively dutch thing and i was about to mention it , til i guess . 
  longer bridges and faster trains, 
  i personally found the colloseum really disappointing on the inside . 
  this is why we are ultimately the superior country , no matter how often you may beat us in football . 
  what do you mean , latin is much more of a romance language ( in fact it is it 's origin ) than esperanto , which has tons of words from different kinds of european languages . 
  in addition to that , esperanto is wayyyyy easier . 
  dude esperanto, 
   take the rhineland unless you 're talking about 1815 the appropriate verb is probably `` occupy '' or `` remilitarise '' . 
  landverrader . 
  where did you get this idea op ?
