  oh yeah , that is not what i meant to imply . 
  i encourage everyone learning how to defend themselves . 
  i just also encourage avoiding confrontation where possible . 
  grappling mostly only works in 1-1 fights though . 
  if you are up against a group , grappling someone only makes you vulnerable to strikes from the other persons . 
   the best way to defend yourself is to run away . 
  the first lesson of every proper martial arts class . 
  the surest way to win a fight is to avoid it alltogether . 
  goes back all the way to sun tzu and possible even further than that . 
  in case of paywall  the dutch are generally a pretty content bunch . 
  the netherlands consistently ranks as one of the best places in the world to live . 
  dutch kids are among the happiest in the world , according to unicef . 
  some attribute their high quality of life and general good nature to a rather laid-back approach to work : more than half of the dutch working population works part time , a far greater share than in any other rich-world country . 
  on average only a fifth of the working-age population in eu member states holds a part-time job ( 8.7 % of men and 32.2 % of women ) ; in the netherlands 26.8 % of men and 76.6 % of women work less than 36 hours a week ( [ see chart ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2015/05/blogs/economist-explains/20150516_woc234.png ) ) . 
  why ? 
   part of the reason is that dutch women were relative latecomers to the labour market . 
  compared with other countries , few men had to leave to fight in the world wars of the 20th century , with the result that women did not labour in factories as they did in america and britain . 
  thanks to the country 's wealth , a dual income was often not a necessity for a comfortable life . 
  and dutch politics was dominated by christian values until the 1980s : the focus was mainly on providing state aid ( implicit subsidies in the fiscal system ) so that women could stay at home with children . 
   this changed in the late 1980s , when the state realised that it would be a good idea to mobilise women into the job market . 
  but the cultural conviction that families still needed mothers home for tea-time prevailed , and thus the state worked closely with employers to ensure that the new part-time jobs would enjoy similar legal positions to their full-time equivalents . 
  this has , to an extent , been continued : in 2000 the right for women and men to ask for a job to be part-time was written into law . 
  but ronald dekker , a labour economist at tilburg university , thinks this law is a confirmation of existing practice and therefore largely symbolic , only necessary for certain `` archaic industries '' . 
  instead , he reckons the high prevalence of part-time jobs is largely down to the wide availability of good quality , well-paid `` first tier '' part-time jobs in the netherlands : jobs often considered inferior in many other countries . 
   whether part-time work is good for emancipation is questionable . 
  today , perhaps because part-time work is the norm , women in the netherlands have a relatively high labour-force participation rate . 
  however , the netherlands ' record for getting women into top management roles is dire . 
  the prevalence of part-time work seems to play a role : once you strip out part-timers , women make it into management roles nearly as often as men , according to the cbs ( the main statistics agency in the netherlands ) although that does n't include top management . 
  the dutch government has said that by next year 30 % of executive board positions should be held by women , but that may prove excessively optimistic ; the level is currently just 6 % , according to mijntje luckerath , an academic at tilburg university , who also blames old-fashioned selection processes . 
  and not all part-timers are pleased with their set up : before the financial crisis , fewer than 10 % of dutch part-timers wished they were employed full time ; this has risen to nearly 25 % . 
  this percentage is still much lower than in other eu countries , but it is a striking rise . 
  also the largest ikea west of berlin is in the netherlands .

   when a guard asked what was in the suitcase , the embassy employee answered that it was `` medicine for the prime minister '' and was allowed to go through . 
  well he did n't lie . 
  that 's the media 's bias . 
  people * not * hating americans is n't worth reporting on because it 's not news . 
  it 's the norm . 
  the vast majority of europeans do n't hate americans and never have . 
  we know better than to judge a countries populace by their government . 
  `` gooise r '' is one of the charasteristics of a posh ( `` kakker '' ) accent in dutch . 
  infront of a vowel this sound is an uvular trill [ \u0280 ] , whereas infront of a consonant/at the end of a phrase it is an approximant [ \u0279 ] which does n't roll or even completely left out .

  interesting as in a complete clusterfuck .
