  and yes , they 're all distinct from each other .

   holland triggered, 
  we certainly have many ` avondwinkels ' ( evening stores ) which are open all night and often operated by turks or arabs . 
  also ` tokos ' which are surinamese or indonesian stores . 
  mods are n't capable of shadowbanning people , only admins . 
  i like that there 's no shitposting/excessive meme-ing allowed so the standard of discussion is pretty high . 
  mods are great also . 
  mine only flew the dutch flag on queen 's day and the 4th and 5th of may . 
  obviously not . 
  damn , til i live in a no-go zone, 
  that 's awesome , til . 
  thanks !, 
  oh yeah , alexander for sure . 
  although ... plato , aristotle , homer and archimedes are all contenders . 
  i 'd argue for the living varoufakis is up there . 
  i got this in my inbox and tried to guess which country but could n't until i saw lithuania . . 
  sorry : / i 'll try to learn more about your country . 
  cristiano ronaldo is most likely the most famous european person in the world currently . 
  sadly , i 'd say it 's breivik . 
  she 's not well liked in iceland ? 
  i guess that 's cheating since belgium did n't exist yet ( or indeed the westphalian state system did n't exist at all ) . 
  for me chopin would be the first person i 'd think of . 
  curie is polish ? 
  i always thought she was french . 
  that 's irrelevant though , the question is who is the most famous person from your country . 
  i would consider einstein for germany , for example . 
  / r/travel has got your back, 
  most people would probably say mel gibson lmao . 
  in reality sean connery i guess ? 
  or maybe colin farrell, 
  til mila kunis is ukrainian, 
  hm yeah or one of your dozens of immensely famous music stars . 
  probably bono, 
  anne frank was from germany but lost her citizenship and said she felt dutch so i guess she kinda-sorta counts ? 
  ah yeah , i know the song but i did n't know the name of the artist . 
  fair points about kierkegaard , i only know him because we a bunch in university . 
  also i do n't think people not knowing coster-waldau is danish retracts from the fact that he 's hugely famous currently . 
  good one , but do n't you think he 'd be overshadowed by van gogh , vermeer , and rembrandt ( and maybe even bosch , mondriaan , steen and brueghel ) ? 
  that 's good . 
  and of course the rest of us wo n't judge your entire country just because one evil man happened to be born there . 
  i 'd definitely say it 's zlatan , or alfred nobel . 
  i know austrians do n't want to be associated with hitler , but it 's probably hitler . 
  edit : just saw your edit . 
  honestly i 'd struggle to name any other famous slovenes . 
  i do n't know who graham is . 
  for denmark i 'd say nikolaj coster-waldau recently and of course kierkegaard , niels bohr and hans christian andersen . 
  i 'd say cruijff or van gogh for the netherlands probably . 
   in some places it 's possible to see red deer which is really cool . 
  i never see those though , usually only some roe deer . 
  in addition we have badgers , foxes , martens , boars , goshawks and since recently beavers in our country . 
  i do n't know , i thought it was funny . 
  the dutch made the netherlands *, 
  * triggered *, 
  it 's bullshit . 
  fruits and other food product have been graded for their quality since forever . 
  the eu regulations just means that the way bananas are graded is equal througout the eu so that importers know what they 're getting . 
  the language is portuguese . 
  the other artists i posted are n't spanish either but cuban , colombian , venezolan and puertorican . 
  i also think we do a very good job at keeping suspects anonymous before they 're deemed guilty/innocent . 
  i notice that in the united states it 's common for suspects to be named and depicted with full sized photos even if they turn out to be innocent later . 
  yeah they 're great !, 
  i would like to see them live . 
  which song by them is your favourite ? 
  [ portuguese ( jorge ben jor ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edxhid-p5ne ) [ spanish ( bonba est\u00e9reo ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6szuacqew8 ) [ spanish ( orishas ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgsi-jeolri ) [ spanish ( calle 13 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlfulb7yvr4 ) [ spanish ( los amigos invisibles ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_elmlx4caty ), 
  i think / u/mraronymous is referring to your use of the informal * je * rather than the formal * u * . 
  we are a primitive people that live in windmills and wear shoes made of wood . 
  we fear the water because we invaded its living space and we build huge walls to keep it out and even remove some of the water to make it into land . 
  we worship a queer pagan god that takes the form of a bipedal metal creature which we mount in order to go anywhere , rain or shine . 
  we constructed large churches for this pagan god where you can find thousands of them stalled in rows , but our unconscious divine connection to ours will lead us to immediately know where we left it . 
  throughout the city there are also ` holy roads ' , painted red with the blood of tourist . 
  if you ever step onto one of these without proper precautions you will hear us chanting `` aan de kant vuile kankertoerist ! '', 
  in unison , which is an ancient curse . 
  our national pasttime include making fun of our dear leader willy , complaining about the weather , mocking our neighbours ( both of them ) , sitting in circles on birthdays and being worse than germany at football . 
  agreed with your conclusion . 
  while scary that the pvv is the most popular party it is very unlikely that they will end up governing . 
  not really a language family but i really like creoles . 
  it 's fun to see words from english , spanish , dutch and african languages used in a single phrase in papiamentu , for example . 
  ha , for sure . 
  it might just be because groninger cops are based as fuck . 
  i once passed out in a park in paddepoel after drinking too much and rather than booking me a cop brought me home in his car . 
  huh , til . 
  i have spoken to a police officer while holding an open can in my hand before and all he said was to clean up our trash when we were leaving . 
  does this stem from the singing revolution ? 
   drinking alcohol is also allowed on the train ns even sells beer on the train sometimes ( through railcatering ) . 
  we once had the railcaterer call the next station because we drank all of her beer so she ordered another 12 for us . 
  good times . 
  you 're from groningen right ? 
  because so am i and this is not my experience at all . 
  in the summer at the noorderplantsoen and the hoornseplas you can see loads of people drinking . 
  last week i was standing on a step ladder and it gave me altitude sickness . 
  this might be my dutchness speaking but i thought the b\u00fckk mountains were beautiful . 
  great place for hiking . 
  * robot * is a czech word . 
  * matras * ( matress ) comes from arabic , as do * cijfer * ( number ) and * karaf * ( decanter/pitcher ) . 
  * sjaal * ( scarf ) and * sorbet * come from farsi * bungalow * , * pyjama * and * shampoo * come from hindi * cobra * comes from portuguese * ski * comes from norwegian * steppe * and * toendra * ( tundra ) come from russian * kiosk * , * tulp * ( tulip ) and * yoghurt * come from turkish, 
  speed skating best skating, 
  so now instead of imby we just plant a shit ton of them in the sea, 
  we also have [ these amazing satire raps ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obpsd9dvd9e ), 
   i do n't trust you for a meter .
