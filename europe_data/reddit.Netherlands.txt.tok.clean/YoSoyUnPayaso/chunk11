  ( i do n't trust you at all . ), 
  this one makes sense in english though . 
  they have similar idioms like `` i trust you as far as i can spit '' or `` i trust you as far as i can throw you '' . 
  anyway an additional confusing one is `` high and dry '' because it means the opposite of what it does in english . 
  in dutch it means safe from any harm whereas in english it means you 're stranded without a way out . 
  i do n't believe that . 
  source ? 
  indonesians are very prevalent though , as a result of our colonial past . 
  the general consensus i believe is that most of them are model immgirants . 
  they integrate well , are educated , speak dutch flawlessly and have many restaurants where they serve their delicious food which scores points of course . 
  my mum swears more than me . 
   in the 1980 's my students society organized a netherlands to rome hitchhiking contest !, 
  this still happens a lot . 
  i know at least 4 or 5 different study associations in my town that do this annually and i would n't be surprised if there are more that do . 
  you eat pets in germany ? 
  i figured you only ate livestock . 
  also we do $ 2 , - for round prices, 
  north : jostedalsbreen , norway west : lima , peru south : buenos aires , argentina east : odessa , ukraine, 
  kiev is one of my favourite cities i 've visited in europe but not a very popular tourist destination . 
  we have a bunch of diphthongs on top of reguar vowels . 
  fresh water scuba is a thing, 
  we had snow earlier this year here in groningen . 
  i already studied english and spanish ( and my native dutch of course ) and i would like to tackle a smaller , lesser known language next . 
  i 'm thinking of papiamentu , guaran\u00ed or quechua . 
  i visited istanbul when i was 15 and i loved it . 
  beautiful city , very interesting history and the food was great . 
  would visit again . 
  i visited ukraine , absolutely fantastic country . 
  would love to go back to see more of the country . 
  belgium for their beer and germany for their beer, 
  it 's strange because now that i think about it some of the countries/places that end in - y in english * also * end in - i\u00eb such as normandi\u00eb and itali\u00eb . 
  someone more knowledgeable of dutch linguistics might have to chime in at this point . 
  that sounds like non-sense . 
  almost every country name that ends in - ia in english ends in - i\u00eb in dutch . 
  indonesia , australia , arabia , india ( though not anymore ) . 
  that was amazing, 
  i 'm not from a country that speaks a romance language but i 've studied european languages in university and saying romanian is not a romance language is pretty stupid and also objectively wrong . 
  do you speak gronings ? 
  coleslaw and cookie too, 
  agreed . 
  directness , acting ` normal ' , honesty . 
  we do ? 
  [ here are the full lyrics ] ( http://www.edestaal.nl/index.php/muziek/teksten#nij%20stoatenziel ) of the song !, 
  not my country , nor firefighters but that gif reminded me of [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cmnxude7ns ) from colombia, 
  you could n't be further off . . groningen !, 
  [ this is what the song is about ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/nieuwe_statenzijl ), 
  [ ede staal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjcmvzjinhc ), 
  i lived in the andes for a year and holy shit coming back it felt so weird being able to see the horizon at all times without a single bump anywhere . 
  [ 1953 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_sea_flood_of_1953 ) shaped the dutch attitude to the ocean in a modern era where we can create ungodly structures such as [ the deltawerken ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delta_works ) . 
  i also think it had a great deal of influence in the shaping of the poldermentality that many believe is central to dutch politics . 
  i loved eastern hungary . 
  hortobagy , b\u00fckk mountains , zemplen . 
  norway has some stunning nature as well . 
  the jostedalsbreen and hardangervidda especially . 
  france as a whole is incredibly beautiful . 
  the ardeche and the alps of course are stunning . 
  some great hiking there . 
  normandy and bretagne have some beautiful coastal areas . 
  northern italy is amazing too . 
  the mountain ranges there make for some great hiking . 
  i still want to visit the danube delta and northern scandinavia , as well as the finnish forests and lakes . 
  i do n't think we have much in common with the english at all to be honest . 
  i think we 're the most outgoing of the germanics, 
  i 'd say denmark moreso than germany, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irfluamkooy ) is brilliant too, 
  how do you feel about [ this glorious beast ] ( http://images4.persgroep.net/rcs/6_wmrdku_vzwuli2bxoocvnxt-0/diocontent/63355008/_crop/0/0/900/1337/_fitwidth/694/?appid=21791a8992982cd8da851550a453bd7f&amp;quality=0.9 ) ? 
  i think the belgian accent sounds ` childish ' . 
  not sexy at all . 
  alcohol is a lot cheaper in germany . 
  it 's pretty common here in groningen to drive to the german border , fill up your car with booze and then drive back . 
  i live smack dab in the middle of my city center and i get people asking maybe once a week , especially at night . 
  wow that 's such an entry level tosti . 
  i add bacon , salami , onions , garlic , sometimes tomatoes and spread a bit of oil on the bread before putting it into the iron so the bread becomes nice and crispy . 
   also your point on geography i do n't think you know the location of every state in the us . 
  his remark was n't about the location though , but about the confusion of two countries . 
  while he might not know the location of every state he most likely does know that missouri and mississippi are two different states . 
  edit : fwiw i also thought the other user was a bit snappy and do n't agree with people raining downvotes on you . 
  we discussed this in length at my policy and governance class last week . 
  for all the criticism that the us political system gets they really nail the seperation of powers . 
  they used to be common on our heathlands before wwii , with some 5000 cocks living in the country in 1941 , but loss of habitat ( heathlands becoming forests ) and intensifying of agriculture made their population decline rapidly . 
  they 're as good as lost here in the netherlands and will most like be extinct within the next decade . 
  we have tried to import populations from scandinavia and setting them free here but it did n't work . 
  currently the only population lives on the [ sallandse heuvelrug ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sallandse_heuvelrug_national_park ) [ map of populations in 70s-80s ] ( https://s1.sovon.nl/soorten/cd/soortkaart.asp?euring=3320&amp;bron=a7883&amp;type=schatting&amp;maand=9&amp;periode=1978-1983&amp;prov=&amp;lang=nl ) [ and 2014 ] ( https://s1.sovon.nl/soorten/cd/soortkaart.asp?euring=3320&amp;bron=lsb&amp;type=schatting&amp;maand=0&amp;periode=2014&amp;prov=&amp;lang=nl ) currently we have some 2-4 cocks and 12 or so females still alive . 
  the last time chicks were reared to adulthood was in 2013 . 
  funny that black grouse is hunted there , it is * extremely * protected here in the netherlands . 
  understandable since the breeding population consists of fewer than 20 individuals currently . 
  capercaillies are one of my favourite european birds !, 
  i 'd love to be able to see one some day . 
   mountain birds which species of birds ? 
  where did that r come from ? 
  some large supermarket chains have free coffee for patrons , yeah . 
  i believe we actually took the # 1 spot in coffee/capita from you this year . 
  1/3 of our country is under sea level . 
  swimming lessons are * not * mandatory in school . 
  you 're from groningen but you do n't understand groningers ? 
  what ? 
  i do n't find most of those grandparenty at all . 
  joep , joris , teun , floris , wout specifically are normal names imo , not old fashioned at all . 
  inb4 throat cancer comments, 
  i heard it had something to do with the brain drain that took place from belgium to the netherlands in like the 19th century but idk if that 's true,
