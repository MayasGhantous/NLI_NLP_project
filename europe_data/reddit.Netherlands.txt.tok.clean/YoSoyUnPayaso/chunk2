  yeah , but he neglects to tell that that individual was raised in captivity . 
  they do n't do that in the wild . 
  there are several better mimics than the lyrebird in the bird kingdom . 
  hill myna and african grey , for example . 
  we have peregrines in europe too . 
  they are the most widespread bop there is . 
  also european magpies  australian magpies, 
  yeah kookaburras are great , i wish we had forest kingfishers in europe . 
  european magpies are not related to australian magpies but are very similar in personality regardless . 
  curious , intelligent and bold . 
  a very fun bird to observe and with their flashes of bright green and blue in their plumage they are beautiful as well . 
  i know . 
  penguins are cool indeed . 
  we have pelicans and magpies in europe as well though so we 're tied there . 
  i would personally argue that european magpies are cooler than australian ones but that is mostly a matter of taste . 
  they 're migratory , wintering in sub-saharan africa every year , so they 're at least 50 % african . 
  the only bird with a confirmed human kill, 
  oh lol derp i knew that but it went completely over my head . 
  i accidentally a part of my phrase , thanks for pointing that out . 
  hold the fuck up . 
  golden eagles may be badass as hell but australia has the wedge-tailed eagle and white-bellied sea-eagle . 
  not to mention the cassowary , kookaburras , tons of parrots and parakeets , lyrebird , cockatoos , etc. 
  i realize this is a joke but as a european birder i have to say australia blows most european countries * out of the water in terms of birds . 
  that depends on the region , their diet differs vastly depending on where you are . 
  i 've seen them take chamois in the alps , for example . 
  according to some studies the roe deer is the primary prey item for golden eagles in certain areas . 
  saying that they do n't normally hunt deer is simply untrue . 
  furthermore they are adaptive and opportunistic birds and have a wide range of prey items so even if sheep and reindeer are n't normally their preferred prey they will still take one if the opportunity presents itself . 
  the wikipedia page i linked cites several sources that claim that golden eagles prey on wild reindeer and roe deer and that document the predation of sheep . 
  it is also important to note that most of the predation of sheep and reindeer involve fawns and lambs , not adult animals . 
  right , let me rephrase that . 
  the farmers claim they kill sheep and reindeer . 
  that said there is plenty of evidence of golden eagles killing ungulates . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dietary_biology_of_the_golden_eagle#ungulates  in total , deer comprise about 4.97 % of all golden eagle food , bovids about 4.92 % , pigs about 0.71 % and pronghorns less than that . 
   sheep are sometimes eaten in considerable numbers , especially in the inner and outer hebrides of scotland ( 25.9 % and 26.8 % of nest remains respectively ) . 
   in the near arctic regions of scandinavia , reindeer ( rangifer tarandus ) of both semi-domestic and wild stock are fed on with some regularity ; one study in northern sweden found reindeer formed 11.4 % of prey items . 
  they kill sheep and reindeer, 
  what ? 
  i do n't think they thought this far ahead . 
  [ nedermarken ] ( https://dev-urandom.eu/_media/settlements:nederflag.png?w=250&amp;tok=f933d4 ) when ? 
  they were most likely vagrants from the german populations . 
  we do have a number of places which could maybe/possibly sustain a population of wolves ( oostvaardersplassen , primarily ) but overall we would need a better ecological network and wildlife corridors here in the netherlands if we really want larger mammals - both prey and predators - to make our country their home again . 
  the netherlands , as you probably know , is really densely populated so as long as we do n't improve what in dutch is called [ ecologische hoofdstructuur ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecologische_hoofdstructuur ) there will be many conflicts between animals like wolves and farmers , as well as the country being too crowded for a sustained population of wolves or other large predators with extended habitats to live here . 
  all in all i am really psyched though at these combacks that several animals are making . 
  birds such as the white-tailed eagle and osprey are doing quite great , in addition to the animals named in the article i posted . 
  great stuff , 
  recently wolves ( and also jackals ) have even been spotted here in the netherlands for the first time in god knows how long . 
  i took traveled around south america for half a year , then i took classes in university and then i lived in colombia for a little over a year . 
  learning languages is loads of fun !, 
  i speak dutch , english and spanish fluently and am currently starting to learn portuguese . 
  i am thinking of doing either italian or a non-european language after . 
  come hang out at / r/languagelearning !, 
  do n't forget muh stamppot please . 
   that 's really low . 
  only to counteract how friggin ' high i am right now . 
  and also tall . 
  of je worst lust ? 
  are you implying we wo n't just build our levies , dams and dikes higher and higher until we are the only country left on earth that is n't flooded yet ? 
  source ? 
  i have never heard otherwise than that we are the tallest . 
  i think / u/jav0k was referring to the stereotype of dutch directness , not dutch cheapness . 
  he said `` rot toch op '' which is somewhere between `` piss off '' and `` fuck off '' on the ( subjective ) expliciteness scale in my opinion . 
  but yeah his message was not softballed . 
  not social in the mediterranean way but yes they were very nice and i talked with a bunch of them at length about the conflict both in formal settings and when drunk in bars . 
  vodka opens them up for sure . 
  i visited there last year , it was lovely . 
  kiev is a beautiful city and odessa has a lot of fun parties and the vodka flows readily . 
  the food is delicious in my opinion , as is most eastern-european food . 
  i also went to chernobyl which was of course a very impressive experience . 
  the situation in the far east of the country is of course tragic but i would still recommend the country as a destination for a visit . 
  tricycles are an invasive species here . 
  they should be removed from the ecosystem . 
  [ here 's a video of that thing in action ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gaibu56myo ) . 
  according to the description of that video 15000 bikes are fished out of the canals annually . 
  and we should use the prinsenvlag . 
  [ nice flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/elburg_vlag.svg ), 
   clearly shows how sensitive the dutch are when it comes to the `` turkish business '' you missing the fact that this is from a satire show * clearly * shows how sensitive the dutch are ? 
  sure , buddy . 
  dat anschluss of belgium though, 
  disappointing but still a huge win . 
  [ i heard that one before ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zhapuum.jpg ), 
  they say in the beginning it 's because our language sounds fun . 
  wilders is from there, 
  yes , pvv got 7 % . 
  thanks !, 
  it was just on tv also , confirmed these counts . 
  agreed , i added it to my comment . 
  amsterdam results : gl - 19,3 % d66 - 18,2 % vvd - 15,2 % big win for gl here also significant is 7,5 % for denk here . 
  d66 , cu are the two climate friendly parties that are currently most likely to enter into the coalition . 
  furthermore there are gl , pvdd and other left wing parties , however with the sweep that vvd seems to have achieved it is unlikely we 'll get a left-wing coalition . 
  you mean `` dank u '', 
  i understand that but fuck wilders , 0 votes for him would be best . 
  i 'd say we * all * need to pay for this , but the large corporations need to pay the most . 
  unfortunately vvd is the largest again so the corporations will be given break upon break . 
  is n't the climate worth it ? 
  i 'd rather have dry feet and high taxes than drown and have low taxes . 
  we in the netherlands of all places should know how important it is to prevent the rising sea levels . 
  what is your beef with gl ? 
  he still won seats though . . 
  i 'm happy with the results but we can do better next time .
