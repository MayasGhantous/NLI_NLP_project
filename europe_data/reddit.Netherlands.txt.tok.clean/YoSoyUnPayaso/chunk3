  this is the future of european integration brother < 3 thank you for caring, 
  tech malfunction , nothing noteworthy . 
  the actual exit polls are posted in this thread above . 
  nope , [ the old building still exists ] ( https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-obx4s2ynruw/ujkwk2sy3mi/aaaaaaaaovs/pbtgkvxe7s8/s901/12-10-299_den%2520haag%2520binnenhof%2520tweede%2520kamer.jpg ), 
  lmao pvda socialists . 
  sp got 14 seats . 
  sorry , fixed . 
  the cabinet lost a combined 39 seats . 
  holy shit . 
  29 for pvda ( record losses ) and 10 for vvd . 
  entered a coalition with vvd and did a lot of concessions . 
  people saw this as selling out their ideology in return for power . 
   wilders  we can still be respectful and kind to other cultures i 'm afraid wilders passed that stage . 
   glad i was n't the only one that struggled with some paper https://speld.nl/2017/03/15/man-verstrikt-geraakt-stembiljet/, 
  yes any . 
  and you do n't need to register like in the us , the government will send you a `` voting pass '' and all you need is that and a valid id and you can vote . 
  i went to the city hall voting station , possible the busiest in my city , and i was in and out within 10 or 15 minutes . 
  there are many ( * many * ) voting stations and they 're in public locations ( schools , universities , etc. ) . 
  voting can be done in 10 minutes . 
  it 's very easy to just vote on your way to/from work or school , during your lunch break or just in the evening ( polls are open till 21 ) . 
  what makes you say that ? 
  yeah international coverage of the elections has been awful by and large . 
  sensationalistic and creating issues that do n't exist . 
  `` nexit '' is pretty much a non-issue here but some international media seem to portray this election as being almost completely about our future in the eu . 
  i know that ( ik ben ook nederlands ) but i meant the `` as a joke '' . 
  you 're hoping to be disappointed then . 
  what do you want translated ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  probably a combination of different factors . 
  we 'll see tomorrow evening i suppose . 
  while that is true , / u/rannasha 's point that people in a fptp system are incentivized to vote for larger parties rather than small ones , thereby favouring a two party system in the long run , is true also, 
  i think many/some potential pvv voters want a harder stance towards turkey but are n't fans of wilders . 
  they might be more charmed by rutte after this weekend . 
  conservative liberal . 
  he did n't say he does n't want vvd he said he does n't want a coalition that has vvd ** and ** cda . 
  pvda 's coalition with vvd seems to have cost them a lot of votes , so maybe the other left wing parties will be more reluctant to form a coalition with vvd unless the vvd is willing to make some significant concessions . 
  it seems rutte is `` profiting '' more from the turkish spat than wilders is . 
  wait , really ? 
  nos is the public broadcaster . 
  what about pechtold ? 
  as a life long gl voter , what do you think of klaver ? 
  and what would you think if they entered a coalition with the vvd ? 
  they might have a liveblog on nos.nl as well . 
  wow that is surprisingly high . 
  higher than i expected at least . 
  [ enjoy ( nsfw ) ] ( https://vimeo.com/80753751 ), 
  i hope for gl 's sake they do n't enter into a coalition with vvd lest they implode like pvda did . 
  might be lost in translation a bit . 
  `` doe normaal '' is a very common dutch expression to the point where the [ stuff dutch people like blog ] ( https://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2010/11/26/no-56-normalcy-doe-normaal/ ) wrote an entry about it . 
  neither is the pvdd , despite what their name suggests . 
  i 'm a young-adult and i also love ancilla . 
  wo n't be voting pirates though . 
  do you understand [ gronings dialect ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjcmvzjinhc ) also what did you think of klaver ? 
  's - hertogenbosch means des hertogen bosch which means `` forest of the duke '', 
  right , but regardless of which exact definition he uses the answer to `` why is kazakhstan included ? '', 
  is `` because the author uses a definition of europe that encompasses part of kazakhstan '' . 
  clearly the creators of the diagram in the op did n't use definition d but rather a and j. 
  a part of kazakhstan is west of the ural and therefore geographically in europe . 
  regardless of that they 're not a symbol that is commonly associated with the netherlands at all . 
  that has nothing to do with the fruit though, 
  they 've got rectangular shields also, 
  yes i realize that but without also clarifying * how * city a thinks of itself it is useless to posit it in this way . 
  i do n't know how singapore or belgrade or whatever thinks of itself so this tweet is meaningless . 
  they seem like very empty statements . 
  what does that even mean ? 
   o n't they have a 5 % threshold to keep tiny party out ? 
  there 's no threshold . 
  flater and blunder are synonyms of different origins ( one germanic , one romance ) . 
  yeah , flater means blunder . 
  yep , called guust flater here . 
  quite popular but not as popular as asterix and obelix . 
  yeah but a prize of < $ 50 , - does not mean you can reasonably assume so and therefore is not heling . 
  here in groningen it 's very easy to find student bikes for less than 50euros . 
  buying a bike under $ 50 , - is not illegal lmao, 
  i paid $ 25 , - for my current bike and it was n't stolen nor did it break down . 
  it is , however , a complete piece of shit . 
  there 's even [ a word for it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ietsism ) . 
  the city groningen is on a small hill that 's part of the [ hondsrug ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hondsrug ) . 
  the surrounding parts of the province however , especially the parts to the north-east where they will likely want the tesla factory , are largely polders either below or slightly above sea level . 
  the afsluitdijk has nothing to do with groningen . 
  errr . . no . 
  the area they 're talking about is almost completely polder and historically flooded all the time . 
  this bid is exactly to get jobs to there . 
  perhaps . 
  i 've been abroad quite a bit and i have n't noticed that dutch and belgian people talk shit about local cultures more than others . 
  in my experience everyone does that . 
  that 's because putting an `` underlying message '' in your words is seen as being dishonest here , which is the greatest sin to dutch people . 
  sounds like you 've tussled with the infamous dutch directness that makes expats hate life here . 
  you 're confusing `` nation '' and `` state '' . 
  a nation is :  a large body of people united by common descent , history , culture , or language , inhabiting a particular state or territory . 
  it 's just a group of people , there 's no need for them to have an independent country or sovereignty . 
  frisians in the netherlands are a nation for example , but not a state . 
  colombia especially would be interesting although a map with one dot for each attack between 1970-today would probably render the entire map covered in dots . 
  it 's just over an hour to get to eindhoven from rotterdam by car, 
  i was not just talking about the information in that post specifically but all the stuff you talked about in this thread !, 
  thanks for the links anyway . 
  dutch is my native tongue so no worries there . 
  i 'll get to reading some on wikipedia . 
  can you recommend any books written on the netherlands ( or the peoples that lived in this general area at the time ) in this era ?
