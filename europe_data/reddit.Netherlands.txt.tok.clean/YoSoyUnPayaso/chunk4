  not questioning your claims , just asking for my own further reading : where do you get all this from ? 
  more proof that we 're the * real * masters of the bike , since this has been the case in most dutch cities for a long time . 
  ops other map is great too https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/2ept81/stereotypes_of_the_netherlands_oc_2000x2255/, 
  people from [ here ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/baflo ) would love to visit that driehoek . 
  if you 're gronings you could translate it as good/beautiful/nice so it 'd be beautiful monk 's eye . 
  my bad . 
  i think he did , since / u/victorvan is also the creator of [ this beauty ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/2ept81/stereotypes_of_the_netherlands_oc_2000x2255/ ), 
  is n't groningen 's origin disputed ? 
  just a student, 
   not having a working bell is a pretty expensive ticket , you know . 
  lol what ? 
  i 've never been ticketed for not having a bell . 
  i 've never been even stopped for not having a bell . 
  how the hell do you get a ticket for that ? 
  i have n't had a working bell ( nor working lights , front or back for that matter ) since maybe year 4 of high school and i 've never ever been stopped about it . 
  it 's pretty stale and unfunny in my personal opinion . 
  oh look it 's this quote again, 
  i think that problem is ony the case if you live rurally . 
  if you live in any city not in de randstad ( groningen for example ) you can definitely go to clubs or friends houses without having to have a car . 
  you could n't envision living outside of the randstad because of nachttreinen ? 
  i hate having wet jeans after cycling through the rain though, 
  yeah that 's true . 
  dorne ( and the iron islands ) is a joke in the show . 
  book!areo : `` i am one of the most well respected fighters in dorne and the captain of the guard to one of the most important people in all of westeros . 
  every one of my waking thoughts is in service of his protection . 
  my poleaxe never leaves my side and i wo n't hesitate to cut down any threat to him . '', 
  show!areo : `` you know those girls we just imprisoned for conspiracy against the prince of dorne ? 
  how about we free them , re-arm them , allow them in front of the prince with their weapons and without any additional guards and then i turn my back on them . 
  surely nothing could go wrong . '', 
  book!ellaria : `` how about we * do n't * betray literally everything oberyn stood for ? '', 
  show!ellaria : `` you know how oberyn said `` we do n't hurt little girls in dorne '' ? 
  how about we do exactly that ? '', 
  moscow , albania , bhutan . 
  i do n't see what 's so badass about three crosses . 
  it 's all right but far from the most badass imo . 
  so sad they cut both arianne and quent from the show , then murdered doran for no good reason and gave his most bad ass line to fucking varys . 
  what the heck d&d ? 
  friesland is more similar to groningen than de randstad is . 
  which services ? 
  fair enough but it is first and foremost associated with fryslan . 
  i 've lived in the ommelanden but i never saw the pompebled used as a symbol there . 
  yes that 's the one, 
  i remember reading and article about the rift between the randstad and the north and the author recounted an anecdote where an amsterdammer asked her whether they sold cigarettes in groningen or whether she should stock up before going . 
  i 'm from groningen and even i would rather have a pompelbled than amsterdam 's crosses . 
  also check out / r/rewilding , 
  the video pitch of the rewilding europe project mentions this so it 's definitely something that is taken into account by the people involved with the reintroductions . 
  it started on / r/thenetherlands before that i 'm sure, 
  none of them use the crossings as effectively as wolves because they are not pack hunters . 
  wolves use them as bottom neck in some places , that is true , but 1 ) we do n't have wolves in the netherlands ( yet ) and 2 ) it is only a minor downside compared to the major upside that is animals being able to cross highways safely , especially in our densely populated country where habitat fragmantation is rampant, 
  cyclists use everything in the netherlands, 
   common all over the world errr not really . 
  they are common in many countries but i would n't say all over the world . 
  some of my south american friends were extremely impressed by this concept . 
  [ here is a video about these kinds of crossings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd0d3bvbm7y ) . 
  one of the goals in nature preservation in the netherlands is to connect all the important nature reserves through the [ naturenetwork ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/natuurnetwerk_nederland ) within the context of the european network of [ natura 2000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natura_2000 ) reserves . 
  some of the crossings are as large as the one in ops photo but there are also smaller ones that are simply [ tubes underneath the highway ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmfuqnfcx_y ) . 
  otters have recently started recolonizing our country and are spreading fast but because we 're a pretty densely populated country they are often hit by cars unfortunately . 
  these tubes are a great way for them to safely spread to new territories without risking getting hit . 
  that 's very sad . 
  do you know if there 's any possible place they could migrate to over time ? 
  since the climate change effect will happen over longer periods of time the population could just shift towards places where the drought is less severe , right ? 
  it was also one of the world 's first protected species , receiving protected status in 1504 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_bald_ibis#europe, 
  they are certainly a `` conservation success story '' with the population [ numbering in the 400s as of 2015 ] ( http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?264853/worlds-most-endangered-cat-grows-to-over-400-individuals# ) , up from only around 100 individuals in the beginning of the 21st century, 
  according to stichting wolven in nederland and the research the have done we have plenty of space for a pack of wolves . 
  wolves thrive in culture landscape in germany . 
  11 wolf packs is not a big number , agreed , but it is compared to what we can expect here in the netherlands which can house around 10 packs in the entire country at most . 
  right now we have only seen two individual wolves from german wolf packs which already caused some `` panic '' among people . 
  people are already fearing the arrival of one single wolf pack , compared to which 11 if a large number . 
  i do agree that compensating the farmers is essential for the return of the wolf to be feasible because they would most likely be subject to persecution by farmers who want to protect their livelihoods . 
  here in the netherlands we 've had only two sightings of wolves in the past few years , which were the first in 150 years or so . 
  wolves are closing in on the dutch border from germany so we could expect them more frequently here within the next decade or so . 
  i do n't know if the return of the wolf is being facilitated per se but it is not actively opposed at least . 
  i do think that we should try to reduce habitat fragmentation if we want wolves to roam our country again . 
  agreed , here in the netherlands the provincial governments are already working on integrating natural areas so that habitat fragmentation is reduced . 
  in my opinion this should be a priority . 
  if we manage to connect the natura 2000 areas europe-wide that would be great for biodiversity on the continent . 
  here in the netherlands a pack of bisons is already reintroduced in the dunes of north holland and because of the success there there are plans to reintroduce more in other places . 
  i applaud the initiative to rewild europe by bringing back large grazing animals but there is also a downside to it as we can see in the oostvaardersplassen in the netherlands . 
  they experimented with large grazing animals ( koniks , heck cattle and red deer ) there without human intervention but because 1 ) there are no predators there and 2 ) the area is fenced off the population exploded but the animals could n't spread out . 
  this resulted in the area being grazed barren which is detrimental to the biodiversity , and then the large herbivores started to starve . 
  i would say that if we want to reintroduce large grazers such as bison , aurochs and red deer to the country we should either connect the nature reserves with each other so the animals can roam freely or we should facilitate the reintroduction of large predators such as the wolf . 
  here in the netherlands the farmers are already complaining at the prospect of wolves possibly coming here within the next decade . 
  i understand their concerns but i also feel that sometimes they are more scared of the idea of wolves than of the actual tangible outcomes . 
  [ according to this ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/study-finds-german-wolves-prefer-wildlife-to-livestock-a-821013.html ) article wolves in germany prefer wildlife over livestock and only killed around 300 sheep in 10 years in a state that has numerous ( 11 ? ), 
  wolfpacks . 
  that 's not that many in my opinion and if the farmers are compensated by the state it should not be a concern . 
  attacks on humans are almost unheard of . 
  the positive effects on the ecosystem outweigh the negative effects on society . 
  [ rewilding europe ] ( https://rewildingeurope.com/ ) is doing great work too . 
  as for the bison it is already being reintroduced in a number of countries so the process has started . 
   i assume denmark also have problems with wolves attacking livestock ? 
  apparently the area in which they have settled has plentiful roe deer so lets hope they will stick to deer as their primary prey . 
  wolves in germany are expanding rapidly westward and closing in on the dutch/belgian border . 
  we 'll see them more and more frequently here in coming years . 
  otters , beavers and white-tailed eagles are also doing quite well here . 
  good to see wildlife return to western europe . 
  there are several throughout europe . 
  check out rewildingeurope.com and rewildingbritain.org.uk, 
  their numbers in europe have been increasing in recent years , as have wolves , wolverines and lynxes . 
  and the lauwers sea ( now lauwers lake ),
