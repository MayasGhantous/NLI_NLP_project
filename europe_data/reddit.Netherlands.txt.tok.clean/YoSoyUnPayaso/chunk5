  it is truly sad . 
  the polish government is also saying the forest was `` illegally '' added to the unesco world heritage list . 
  whatever that means . 
  he lan is een chinees ? 
  okay whatever . 
  have a nice weekend . 
  you call people edgy teens , butthurt , pathetic and insecure in just two comments . 
  you try to portray me as someone who snaps at being called hollander but from your comments it seems you care more than me . 
  i see no need why you have to make it personal with your `` people will surely like being around you '' when all i said was i 'm not from holland . 
  you 're acting more like a butthurt edgy teen than me . 
  you 're the one getting butthurt and calling others names here . 
  i 'm not insecure , i 'm just not from holland . 
  `` everyone who does n't agree with me is an edgy teen ! '', 
  doggerpolder *, 
  free wifi too . 
  they 're perfectly valid words , why would n't they count ? 
  yes it was an amazing trip . 
  besides visiting some serious places such as the embassy , the uni in belgrade and the un mission in kosovo we also had a taste of the nightlife and met a lot of locals and i was very charmed by both the serbian and kosovar people . 
  i only spent one day in b&h , just to visit srebrenica . 
  the rest of the trip was in belgrade , nis , pristina and prizren . 
  mostly things about possible eu integration of serbia and nation building and independence in kosovo . 
  i went with university . 
  we visited a bunch of places in the region to learn about the past and future . 
  oh of course he sees those two as the primal bad guys but he also sees the dutch peacekeepers as being partially responsible for what happened . 
  i would recommend his book `` under the un flag '' . 
  i know that , but you ca n't blame the only surviving member of a family that has been murdered in cold blood for thinking otherwise . 
  also they could have refused to hand over the civilians to the serbian army without having to fire shots . 
  they could have stood their ground and protected the innocents in what was supposed to be a dmz . 
  from what the people there told me , they do n't blame the dutch for being outgunned and outnumbered but they blame them for not even trying to do anything . 
  they did n't fire a single shot . 
  people were being murdered less than 100 meters from the compound ( i 've been there , you could throw a rock the distance that 's between the two places ) and they did n't even go to investigate . 
  they rolled over and handed over thousands of innocent civilians to a group of butchers . 
  oh do n't be sorry , it was a very interesting experience and i learned a lot from it . 
  we spoke with [ hasan nuhanovic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hasan_nuhanovi%c4%87 ) , and he definitely holds the dutch troops partly responsible for the massacre . 
  i visited srebrenica two weeks ago , it was surreal . 
  i personally thought it was way heavier than visiting auschwitz for example because of how ` fresh ' it is . 
  there were women on the memorial mourning their lost sons , brothers , husbands and fathers . 
  it also felt very strange to be regarded as the `` bad guys '' , it 's not a feeling i am used to as a dutch man . 
   and then post stuff like this . 
  fwiw i initially posted it in / r/propagandaposters but it got removed from there . 
   it 's the slow intellectual death of a movement i actually used to identify with , political cartoons have been a thing since forever and are used by both sides of the political spectrum . 
  what makes this particular cartoon so much worse than any other ? 
    everybody furiously masturbates while upvoting   people start clapping while congratulating each other over how smart they are it 's hard to take someone seriously when you post things like that , especially when combined with le ebin meme arrows fwiw i initially posted this to / r/propagandaposters but it got removed from there because they do n't accept modern propaganda .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince%27s_flag#legacy the current south african flag is also partly based on the current dutch flag https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_south_africa#colour_and_symbolism, 
  yes , the [ prinsenvlag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/prinsenvlag.svg/1200px-prinsenvlag.svg.png ) . 
  i personally prefer it over our current flag but sadly it has become associated with the far right because the dutch nazi collaborators during wwii used this flag . 
  student from the netherlands here : breakfast ( if i have class ) : banana and coffee breakfast ( if i do n't have class ) : banana , fried eggs with bacon , juice and coffee lunch : usually rolls with hummus or another spread or a tosti ( croque monsieur ) dinner : usually something involving rice and chicken since those are rather cheap . 
  i do n't eat meat daily though . 
  i do n't snack a lot of sweets , througout the day i eat yoghurt , nuts and/or fruit . 
  salade ni\u00e7oise or bandeja paisa, 
  exactly . 
  without fail when people are loud in the stiltecoupe someone will tell them to cut it out . 
  i agree on all counts and would like to add that political memes and satire is very popular here . 
  i also do n't understand why you call it `` childish crap '' , seems very condescending for no reason . 
  political satire have existed since forever , the format has just changed since the internet . 
  someone would tell them off quite quickly . 
  dutch people by and large are n't afraid to tell other people to `` act normal '' ( `` doe normaal ! '' ), 
  in public and we can be quite blunt about it . 
  we have plenty of political memes that are popular on social media . 
  trap er niet in ! , segers and egypt , de jessias . 
  yes to istanbul in 2007 or something,

  the answer to your question is `` yes , some european people would prefer some ( or most ) of republican ideals over democrat ideals , while others would not '' . 
  it 's not like every european is left wing . 
  far from it in fact . 
  it 's just that your political system is skewed so to the far right that we seem left wing in comparison . 
  europeans have divergent political preferences just as americans do . 
  i know they exist but i never had them . 
  i do n't think they 're very popular . 
   ` czech film ' - nobody knows what the hell is going on ( does n't have to be a movie , it can refer to everyday absurd situations ) is this a kafka reference ? 
  our former minister of foreign affairs frans timmermans speaks six languages i think ( dutch , english , german , french , italian and russian ),

  fair enough , tastes differ . 
  as always when this question is posted i 'll refer you to the wonderful map made by u/victorvan : http://i.imgur.com/qyzbr8r.jpg thread here : https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/2ept81/stereotypes_of_the_netherlands_oc_2000x2255/, 
  my city : https://vimeo.com/76207227, 
  we drink tap water in the netherlands, 
   too far away from the parts i like but it 's so close to the best city in the country though  i was just in drenthe today and it 's very beautiful . 
  the nature there is really nice . 
  agreed . 
  the realization of the natuurnetwerk should be a priority in nature conservation in the netherlands, 
  in germany several packs of wolves have adapted to culture landscape such as we have in the netherlands as well . 
  the idea that wolves will only thrive in pure untouched nature is a myth . 
  they will do just fine in the netherlands . 
  according to stichting wolven in nederland we have space for 14 small packs . 
  yep agreed . 
  i am grateful that hunting is as regulated as it is here . 
  now if only we could have wolves return and stop fencing off all nature reserves . 
  answer : allow wolves to come back and reconnect nature reserves so the deer populations can disperse . 
   this does not permit you to hunt , however . 
  aspiring hunters must educate themselves and pass a hunters ' diploma to prove they are competent and responsible ( also afterwards they must practice often to ensure they do n't provoke any needless suffering to their prey by shooting them and missing somewhat ) ; one of the requirements is also that they have access to hunting grounds ( which is a bit more difficult in some parts of the netherlands that are highly populated like the randstad ) . 
  hunting is in fact quite common here and `` excess '' deer populations ( that form due to lack of predators ) are shot off every year . 
  only in some areas hunting is not practices at all . 
  just because the requirements for getting a hunting permit are very strict does not mean it is not done at all . 
  it 's just that we want it to happen in the `` best '' way possible so the requirements are therefore as strict as they are . 
  i was obviously just talking about the school i went to .
