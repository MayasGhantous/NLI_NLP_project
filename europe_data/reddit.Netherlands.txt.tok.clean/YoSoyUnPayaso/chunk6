  is n't it spelled patois ? 
   it 's nearly a different language it is a different language . 
  it 's a creole . 
  yeah they are quite popular but also rather expensive . 
  about $ 3 , - for 150g in the supermarket . 
  cheaper on the market probably but i never bought them there . 
  tenk joe det is ferry kaind of joe toe seej, 
  there are a few , usually in the heathland areas in the south . 
  wolves are starting to spread again , also to switzerland https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/a-first-_wolf-seen-in-swiss-towns/42952024, 
   oh , we also have adders , but i 've never seen one . 
  i have seen them . 
  beautiful creatures . 
  the wolves are n't `` usually '' killed by traffic . 
  in fact the only wolf that was found dead here was revealed to have been killed in eastern europe and put in the netherlands as a `` prank '' . 
  the confirmed wolf sightings have all made it out of the country back to germany alive . 
  doggerpolder pls, 
  quite common . 
  my parents have them in their garden . 
  facebook  all of those websites . 
  just look for `` housing [ city ] '' and you 'll find a handful of active groups for each city . 
   political it 's all over the place due to the amount of choices we have despite political differences i would n't say the country is divided politically because of our poldermodel style politics . 
  we know people disagree with us but we make it work regardless . 
  how is hern\u00e1n cort\u00e9s seen in spain ? 
  the center of amsterdam is pretty much a tourist enclave these days and they have also started to spread to other cities in increasing numbers as well . 
  my last name is not uncommon but not very common either . 
  i 'm not surprised wen i meet someone with the same last name but it does n't happen very often either . 
  my mums last name is very rare and when i meet someone with the same last name as her they are most likely relatives . 
  not really a culture shock but for me it 's always a bit of a hassle to speak with english people because of how our natures clash . 
  the infamous `` dutch directness '' and english politness and english `` double meaning '' when they speak are polar opposites and make conversation tedious . 
  [ this graphic ] ( http://www.merican.vickihollett.com/wp-content/uploads/anglo-dutch1.gif ) always comes to mind, 
  khadija arib , the speaker of our house of representatives , immigrated to the netherlands when she was 15 from morocco . 
  same thing goes for ahmed aboutaleb , the mayor of rotterdam . 
  humberto tan , a famous tv presentor , was born in paramaribo , suriname . 
  edit : and of course our queen who is from argentina, 
  try harder, 
   addition : in the east of the country there is the tradition of shooting carbide . 
  the basic version is putting some in a metal milk cannister plugging the hole with a soccerball and lighting it . 
  which produces quite a loud bang . 
  in the north too, 
   potential client well duh . 
  i was talking about casual encounters not professional ones . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with bringing up politics , religion or sex when meeting someone in a bar for example . 
  the list of these three as `` taboos '' for conversation topics when meeting new people is very american in my opinion . 
  culturally , the only thing i would say is a taboo topic in the netherlands when meeting new people is money . 
  i do n't agree with that at all . 
  i 'm really surprised to see a dutchman post this because this is a very american attitude to have in my opinion . 
  my experience does n't fit your comment at all . 
   i did n't mean to be offense though ... do n't worry i was making a joke  holland is indeed the richest part of the netherlands . 
  i am from another part of the country . 
  i would refer you to [ this map ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dxacqec.png ) made by / u/victorvan [ original thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5l9nz0/europe_according_to_the_dutch_a_continent_in/ ), 
   holland * triggered *, 
  lots of rain today here up north, 
  it 's a student house, 
  i live with 9 housemates and we have 4 kitchens . 
  we have three microwaves in my home, 
  i like it a lot , more so than a lot western music in certain settings . 
   my point is that in my mind donald trump reflects more strongly on americans as a group than you might want him to this is something that i 've found to be a difference in thinking between europeans and americans , as you explain eloquently in your post . 
  i hear americans tell europeans that president trump does not represent the average american , while it seems to me that if there is any american who does so it is exactly trump , since he was elected to do just that . 
  the actual biggest difference is in how we call fries . 
  agreed on all counts . 
  in my opinion we should pedestrianize even more areas in our cities . 
   if you do come and you see a bear , do not get close . 
  they seem very cuddly and all , but it is n't safe . 
  there has been instances where tourists stop and try to feed the bears and that 's just not good because something could happen at any moment . 
  thank you for the advice  do you have any tips on other beautiful natural places that someone who likes to go on adventure and see wildlife might enjoy ? 
  they hold their stag parties in amsterdam . 
  get drunk , act crazy , break stuff , piss everywere , puke all over the place . 
  i have never been there but i would love to visit . 
  i heard your nature is beautiful . 
  i would like to visit the danube delta especially for bird watching , and i would also be interested in seeing bears , wolves and/or lynxes . 
  if it makes you feel any better the tourists with the worst rep in the netherlands are the brits . 
  yes . 
  in my experience indos are more secular , including the older generations . 
  i 'm not sure , i think mostly the latter . 
  my generation ( 20s ) mostly atheist but culturally muslim . 
  surinamese , antillean , turkish , moroccan , indonesian i have no problems with any of them as a whole . 
  indo girls are very pretty . 
   - groningen has commies and one university and muh earthquakes, 
  we have this in the netherlands too , `` niet stemmers '' ( non-voters ) . 
  they did n't get enough votes for a seat either here . 
  second half of the 17th century, 
  also max havelaar, 
  [ so is one of ours ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cirkeltrek ), 
  proper bike infrastructure, 
  i do n't care one way or the other but i do wonder why someone would want italian citizenship if they do n't identify as italian and have never been there . 
  what 's the point ? 
  i would n't translate `` still water '' ( as in opposite of rough ) as `` stil '' in dutch , i 'd say kalm ( which an english speaker would still understand as meaning calm ) . 
  is n't there already desertification happening in the southernmost part of spain ? 
   some well-known people like soccer player rafael van der vaart ( ... ) are from the dutch traveler community . 
  til, 
  [ also this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn1pau0awk8&amp;feature=youtu.be ) dank / u/monsieursander, 
  [ het goede doel - belgi\u00eb ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtvnmo6crfg ) ( not really about belgium but oh well ) i also know this german song about the netherlands : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drfsxlchrwc, 
  i was there earlier this year ( as well as in bosnia and in kosovo ) and had a great time . 
  i did n't experience any of the things you describe in your post . 
  there 's something similar in belgium https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/natuurdecreet_in_vlaanderen#vlaams_ecologisch_netwerk, 
   they have no project in the benelux the netherlands is actually working ( not very hard ) to create an ecological web all over the country to connect the different nature reserves in order to create more space for wildlife . 
  there are several projects to protect or reintroduce wildlife in the uk such as lynxes , beavers , great bustards and others . 
  what do you think of these projects ? 
  can you tell more about how you were involved in the project ? 
  the netherlands is the top agricultural exporter in europe , totalling 85 billion in total .
