  granted a lot of this is ornamental ( flowers ) and machinery , but still a large part is also vegetables and meat . 
  according to the dutch gov. 
  :  over three-quarters ( 77 % ) of our total agricultural exports go to countries in europe . 
  these mainly consist of tomatoes , sweet peppers , cucumbers , meat and dairy products . 
  from outside europe , flowers and plants are the netherlands ' most in-demand agricultural products , followed by meat and dairy produce . 
   having large , connected forests i think habitat fragmentation is one of the fundamental problems for european wildlife and i would personally think that prioritizing reconnecting natural habitats would be a great improvement . 
  this would also help with genetic diversity , help species enlarge their habitats and be in general beneficial for all life . 
  i agree their website is n't great . 
  if you go [ here ] ( https://www.rewildingeurope.com/areas/ ) and click on one of the areas and then on `` achievements to date '' you will get an overview of their successes in the area you selected . 
  for example here is the page for western iberia : https://www.rewildingeurope.com/areas/western-iberia/achievements-to-date/, 
  what do you think about projects in germany to reintroduce and enhance the populations of species such as wolves and bears ? 
  and what is the general sentiment there ? 
  some of your wolves have already reached the eastern parts of our country , making them the first wolves in over 150 years to be seen here !, 
  the be fair we have just as many overdone tropes about the usa as they have about europe . 
  latin america , colombia specifically . 
  the main reason is because it 's the only continent that i 've visited outside of europe and i lived in colombia for a while . 
  japan does n't attract me at all . 
  seems very soulless , rigid and impersonal to me . 
  public transport . 
  we have a great public transport system compared to 99 % of the rest of the world . 
  there 's one in groningen as well , and i 'm sure in other cities too . 
  / r/language _ exchange, 
  brics are definitely getting more powerful as can be seen in the doha round . 
  i do n't think china is currently `` replacing '' the usa but they 're certainly on the rise . 
  like coughing up hairballs , but not as bad as german, 
  a taxi driver in colombia called me a payaso ( clown ) when i crossed the street in front of him . 
  $ 10 , - is a donnie $ 50 , - is a bankoe $ 100 , - is a barkie `` euro '' in general nicknamed eurie , ekkie, 
  more or less, 
  i know but in colombian slang it 's used as `` buddy '' , `` dude '' , `` bro '' . 
  tatta is slang for a white person, 
  what ? 
   spanish ( latin america ) colombia : marica , parce , mijo  dutch gast , gozer , mattie ,, 
  she was the top candidate for the pirate party in the previous dutch general elections . 
  [ ancilla ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/ancillatillia_portrait.jpg/266px-ancillatillia_portrait.jpg ), 
  1:38 the photo actually matches the dutch lyrics . 
  also i thought of another weird song namely [ drank en drugs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swivbesd50 ) which includes a line that many people found controversial ( `` alle tieners zeggen ja tegen mdma '' , all teenagers say yes to mdma ), 
   a typical tourist in that case only visit amsterdam , eat too much space cake , piss in all the alleys and canals and puke over someones bike seat . 
  without kidding though in the netherlands the most popular tourist attractions are all around the amsterdam area . 
  in amsterdam there is the rijksmuseum and the van goghmuseum and the anne frank house . 
  plus of course a tour of the canals and the famous red light district . 
  then there 's kinderdijk ( windmills ) and keukenhof ( flowers ) . 
  i would however recommend to also try to venture a bit outside of this area . 
  there are numerous nice cities in the netherlands such as utrecht , maastricht and groningen all of which are worth visiting . 
  we also have some islands to the north where you can cycle and enjoy the nature . 
  what kind of things are you interested in seeing ? 
  that 's not a joke party though . 
  they have a serious party programme . 
  you might not agree with their stances but they have 5 seats in the lower house . 
  we had a party called `` niet stemmers '' ( non-voters ) participate in the last election . 
  their programme was that they would refrain from participating in the parliament if they got any seats . 
   you can manage just fine with no dutch in amsterdam ... possibly the rest of the netherlands . 
  but it 's disrespectful not to put some effort into it . 
  agreed completely . 
  used to be only in amsterdam and the hague but now even in my small student city ( groningen ) bars , restaurants and fast food joints hire people regardless of their speaking dutch or not . 
  the city is becoming increasingly international because the university here is actively recruiting international students to come study here and with great success . 
   we should also reclaim congo , indonesia , suriname and even new amsterdam . 
  and doggerbank, 
  `` the president of the united states '', 
  it 's short for `` des '' which means `` of the '' in old dutch . 
  the full name means `` forest of the duke '' . 
   perhaps you should n't have your country 's name in plural  it 's singular in dutch ( `` nederland '' ), 
  [ not everyone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhxo0udpoxm ), 
  or scheveningen . 
  or den haag . 
  and it 's also incorrect . 
  i 'm from the netherlands but not from holland . 
  you do n't have frats in germany ? 
  here they are in every university town and regularly make the news because hazing going too far . 
  namiddag is used regularly in my experience . 
  i 've never heard voormiddag being used . 
  eastern european cities are great for cheap partying . 
  check out wroclaw , kiev , pristina , etc. 
  i was in kosovo and serbia two months ago and i do n't see any reason to think that kosovo is serbia apart from historical ones . 
  they 're two really different states . 
  kosovars are closer to albanians than to serbians . 
  d o g g e r p o l d e r o g g e r p o l d e r, 
  also a large portion of the land being below sea level, 
  how can faliraki be the part of europe closest to asia when europe and asia share a land border ? 
  is that the same as the poldermodel ? 
  pretty much the entire dutch government is in the hague , while amsterdam is our capital . 
  gouda and edammer, 
   a blackfyre pretender  true king it 's treason then, 
  i thought nancy 's speech was great . 
  what did n't you like about him ? 
  i thought technical boy was the best , but czernobog was awesome too . 
  also ` in the dutch mountains ' https://youtu.be/un0vlipkkyg `` i was born in a valley of bricks where the rivers run high above the rooftops '' love that line, 
  i 've seen the first two episodes . 
  the casting is great , i was wondering who they 'd cast for the gods and have been pleasantly surprised about how spot-on they all turned out . 
  thanks . 
  the middle was the part that made me like instead of love it . 
  i 'll give sandman a chance when i have the opportunity . 
  in my year at uni there are italians , germans , spaniards , argentinians , french , brits , americans , russians , a colombian , an uzbeki , taiwanese , indonesian , danish , finnish and probably more that i am forgetting . 
  my course is in english and as you can tell quite popular with international students . 
   a song of ice and fire euron king !, 
  did you read american gods ? 
  it 's the only thing by gaiman i read and i liked it a lot . 
  not comparable . 
  both are great imo but wildly different from each other . 
  love this book . 
  one of my favourite dutch-language books .
