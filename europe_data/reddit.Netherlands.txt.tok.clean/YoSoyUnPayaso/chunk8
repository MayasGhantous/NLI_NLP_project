  regardless frisians are associated with friesland more than the uk in my experience . 
   frisian cows  uk wat . 
  they 're from friesland in the netherlands . 
  why a white-tailed eagle and not a golden eagle ? 
  seems more fitting for austria to me . 
  it 's quite popular as a spread for sandwiches but pbj sandwiches are n't a thing here . 
  what about it ? 
  see / u/victorvan 's amazing map : http://i.imgur.com/qyzbr8r.jpg including explanations here : https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/2ept81/stereotypes_of_the_netherlands_oc_2000x2255/ck1ri0z/, 
  here in the netherlands peanut butter is super popular, 
  we mumble ? 
  i 'd say quite the opposite . 
   i 'm expecting frankfurt and dublin to profit big off of banks moving staff from london . 
  amsterdam too,

  i 've been to several deserts in south america ( tatacoa , atacama ) . 
  it was pretty fun and beautiful . 
  very cool to be able to visit such an ecosystem . 
  i did horseback riding , touring in jeeps and motors and hiking there and saw a lot of interesting things . 
  would recommend . 
  `` gaaf '' ( means ` intact ' ) `` vet '' ( ` greasy ' ) `` tof '' ( ? ), 
  yes very . 
  broadly speaking we have two dialect groups ; the low-franconian dialects and the low-saxon dialects . 
  each of these dialect groups is divided in multiple smaller dialects . 
  then there 's the completely separate language frisian . 
  [ see also these three maps ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/languages_benelux.png ) . 
  [ international media was making fun of our ballot paper last march ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c69azo1wcaarfxq.jpg:large ) . 
  you mark the little bulb next to the candidate you prefer and shove it in a box . 
  mount scenery does n't get snow, 
  we do n't have our own mountains so we have to go abroad . 
  funnily enough we also have `` je kan wachten tot je een ons weegt '' ( you can wait until you weigh an ounce ) to say `` waiting for x to happen is useless because x will never happen '' as a leftover saying from back before the metric system was introduced . 
  colombia is one of the most beautiful and diverse countries there is with so much natural beauty to offer and you 'd advise people to ignore all of it ? 
  feel free to ama about living in colombia as a european, 
  i think the king is a great person and i have nothing against him but if we were to have a vote on it i 'd vote in favour of abolishing the monarchy . 
  i did the same once where i accidentally sent a group of german girls in the wrong direction ... 
  they must think i 'm an asshole . 
  in the netherlands too but that does n't mean we just step into the street without looking for oncoming traffic first or just walk on the street at all times as if it is a footpath . 
  fuuuuuck german tourists coming over here for the flower market and walking in the middle of the street at all times , and crossing the street without looking for traffic . 
  i do n't understand why they do this . 
  there are no cars in the center of my city but that does n't mean you can just walk wherever !, 
  dutch people are more direct than most others . 
  i mostly miss my bike, 
  really ? 
  what 's the dutch word it comes from ? 
  something something dialect with an army and a navy, 
  `` verstaan '' is somewhere between understand or hear . 
  when you do n't versta someone you hear he 's talking but ca n't hear what he 's saying . 
  when you say `` i do n't versta spanish '' you do n't mean you ca n't hear them , just that you do n't understand it . 
  and you would n't versta a bird when you hear it sing . 
  a roma lady ( i think ) hangs out on a bridge between central station and the city center selling [ `` street papers '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/street_newspaper ) to passers by . 
  she 's usually not bothering people who say no . 
  other than that i have no experiences with roma people . 
  ranked best in europe for the past 7 years . 
  road trips to eastern europe are very common among students in the summer . 
  many student associations do hitch-hiking contests every year . 
  it 's always a blast . 
  nonsense . 
  my friends and i , and many other people i know , do a road trip to eastern europe/the mediterranean every summer . 
  who does that ? 
  the only people i know who visit norway go there to go hiking . 
  visiting the cities is way too expensive . 
  a monarch is a head of state . 
  more and more research about alcohol having terrible effect on the developing brain , probably . 
  i personally think it 's a good thing that the age was changed from 16 to 18 here . 
  i live in the city center but it is still quite green . 
  there are plenty of parks and little gardens , as well as trees lining the streets . 
  the entire city is very green . 
  there are also no cars in the city center so the air is very clean . 
  to be fair we have almost double the population . 
  standard dutch is based on haarlem 's dialect . 
  come to groningen and you 'll have the earthquakes without tsunami fear, 
  local holidays vary ( of course ) , in my city it 's the `` gronings ontzet '' or colloquially `` bommen berend '' which celebrates the breaking of the [ siege of groningen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_groningen ) on august 28 . 
   or if you are able to impersonate a german ( no sandals and white socks !, 
  ) , an austrian , a southtirolian , an alsatian , a swiss , a liechtensteiner , a luxemburger , a ( german speaking ) belgian , or a dutchman . 
  why only german speaking belgian if dutch people can also visit ? 
  sailing is super popular here , especially in friesland where there are a lot of lakes . 
  there is a students sailing association in my city that i used to be a member of for a short time . 
  tokos also often carry south american products ( because of suriname ), 
  i hear frisian on a regular basis and i do n't even live in friesland . 
  rising sea levels, 
  i heard we have the most dialects per km2 but do n't have a source for that . 
  see also [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/languages_benelux.png ), 
  i agree that it has to do with portion sizes . 
  we 're taught here to serve no more than we can eat and having food left over is seen as overindulging in our calvinist culture . 
  having food left over means you ordered too much which means you are being wasteful . 
   i 'm also curious as to why some europeans would want to drink warm water ? 
  you are aware that there 's a stage between iced and warm ? 
  i 'm pretty sure only around 1/3 of languages use gendered nouns . 
  i see ( often monolingual ) english-speakers brag about how hard english is all the time . 
  it 's super weird but it happens a lot . 
  someone will point out one quirk of the english language and a dozen comments along the lines of `` english strikes again ! '', 
  will follow , even if that exact same quirk exists in other indo-european languages as well . 
  i lived there for a year already and this is also my answer . 
  [ ' t peerd van ome loeks ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/groningen%2c_peerd_van_ome_loeks.jpg ) and [ another ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/groningen_-_veulen_%281951%29_van_wladimir_de_vries_-_1.jpg ) ( dutch : het paard van ome lucas , english : the horse of uncle luke ) it comes with a song : peerd van ome loeks is dood , loeks is dood , loeks is dood , peerd van ome loeks is dood , hailendal dood . 
  era penal, 
  agreed . 
  usually served on small toasts on a platter like [ this ] ( http://www.president.nl/sites/default/files/toast_0.jpg ) with toasts with brie , with salmon , with pesto , etc. 
  it 's a sandwich spread made of raw beef , egg and pepper,
