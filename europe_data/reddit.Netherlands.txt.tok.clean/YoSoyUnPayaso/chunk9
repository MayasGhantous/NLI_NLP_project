  [ filet americain ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/filet_americain_on_bread.jpg ) is unknown to the americans i 've spoken to about it . 
  they are in general a bit more reserved but not unfriendly in my experience . 
  i 'd advise you to just make friends just like you do in the usa . 
  they 're less `` feigned '' in their smiles and `` how are you today 's '' but they 're not unfriendly at all . 
  my experiences are the same , except i used to go fishing a lot when i was young . 
  hunting is quite rare because it 's pretty hard to get a license here and because most nature reserves do n't allow hunting at all . 
  it 's a two hour flight or so . 
  sometimes we need to do things that we do n't like in order to attain things that we love . 
  so fly instead ? 
  most of the spanish colonial towns are still quite intact also . 
  [ this building was built in the late 16th - early 17th century ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/iglesia_de_san_pedro_claver%2c_cartagena%2c_colombia_%284980511743%29.jpg ) which is similar to the grachtenpanden . 
  [ this building was finished in 1654 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/cath%c3%a9drale_de_cusco_d%c3%a9cembre_2007e.jpg ) . 
   ` nothing from before the spanish came to peru is still standing but that 's bullshit . 
  in cuzco you can see a bunch of inca walls . 
  also many of the old buildings in the netherlands are younger than some buildings in for example arequipa or cartagena . 
  ryanair has cheap flights to poland from eindhoven . 
  i live in a state monument . 
  it 's pretty funny open the door to go to class or something and see people take pictures of my house . 
  and of course the canals . 
  i cross them at least twice a day . 
  with a hyphen . 
  st-janskerk is also used . 
  it sucks that prinsenvlag is associated with neo-nazis nowadays because not only does it look better , it also has a better name ( prinsenvlag ) and a better nickname ( oranje blanje bleu ), 
  indonesian is the most popular asian cuisine here ( for obvious reasons ) . 
  the groene hart is still quite rural though , by randstad standards . 
  i think - nl is very popular also . 
  why ? 
  i can only speculate as i do n't do it myself but most likely to meet other people from your own country online . 
  beflijster ( ring ouzel ) - bef means the throat area but also means going down on a girl . 
  so beflijster could be translated as cunnilingus thrush . 
  the continent and the moon are both called europa . 
  they 're both named after the same person so why change it ? 
  at the moment there is [ frans timmermans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frans_timmermans ) . 
  he is the vice president of the european commission and previously served as minister of foreign affairs . 
  you may recognize him from [ this speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcgcbhnckyi ) that he gave after the mh17 attacks . 
  there is a bit of a running gag in the netherlands that he speaks every single language in europe because [ well , he speaks a lot of languages ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-hyk15uoia#t=0m33s ) ( skip to 0:33 ) . 
  historically the first name that came to mind was [ thorbecke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_rudolph_thorbecke ) who is famous for drafting the constitutional reform that took power from the royal family and gave it to the states general . 
   i doubt most non-americans have heard of them care to name some regardless to educate us ? 
  the atlantic forest is one of the most biodiverse areas in the world so you 're not gon na be disappointed . 
  let me ( or / r/birding in general ) know when you have some specific questions . 
  if you have any questions about bird watching in south america hit me up  i lived in colombia for a year and did a lot of birding there , also visited brazil 3 times . 
  also there 's a split between the low saxon and low franconian dialects . 
  for example here in the north we say `` siepel '' instead of `` ui '' for onion . 
  no but i 've been to the amazon which is pretty much * the * forest in my eyes . 
  i 've been to all 5 inhabited ones several times , with my most visited one being schiermonnikoog at over a dozen times . 
  [ radar love ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jera3rtbiiu ) i 'd guess . 
  our current king was nicknamed `` prins pils '' ( `` the pilsner prince '' ) when he was in university because he liked to drink . 
  in dutch the name of the country is in singular . 
  the country is n't called holland, 
  well we all know that the doggerbank is dutch clay so we 'll just polder in anything between there and the dutch coast and then we 'll just add some more polder between the doggerbank and denmark so we 're connected . 
  why build a bridge over water when we can just turn the water into a polder ? 
  also i 'd love for us to be closer to scandinavia . 
  danish especially seem to be very similar to us . 
  bike bros < 3, 
  i 've found this to be absolutely not the case . 
  a simple `` ik wil graag nederlands spreken om te oefenen '' or something along those lines is enough to get us to speak dutch with you . 
  many expats use the `` nobody speaks dutch with me ! '', 
  as an excuse to be lazy and not learn the language . 
  all my international student friends who want to speak the language do speak it . 
  the ones who say they can never practice are the ones who do n't really care for learning it anyway . 
  also while it is possible to get by with english-only many dutch people will find it very rude if you live here for extended periods of time ( say  1 year ) and do n't make an effort to learn dutch . 
  note that we do n't expect you to be fluent right away but we expect you to at least try . 
  is it true that people outside the netherlands do n't eat [ vla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vla ) ? 
   lock , stock , and two smoking barrels ( guy ritchie crime/comedy , 1998 )   snatch ( guy ritchie crime/comedy , 2001 ) two of my favourites, 
  it used to be 16 but a few years ago they changed it to 18 . 
  i think it 's good that they raised it , people drinking when they 're too young is really bad for them and young people are not as able to restrict themselves as adults are . 
  it 's a well known fact that the americans love grandiloquence . 
  it does n't even register anymore . 
  in dutch it also is n't a very appealing word and [ the colour ] ( https://img.static-smb.be/a/food/image/q100/w480/h360/1458/snert.jpg ) of the soup does n't help , but when you 've been out all day on a cold wintery day and you come back inside with numb fingers and a runny nose there is nothing better than a hot , steaming bowl of snert . 
  snert , a thick pea soup with smoked sausage and a side of rye bread with bacon . 
  til , thanks . 
  i thought that measure was only in place for the student grants . 
  i would change it because it 's placing the monarchy so central to our national identity which i do n't feel fits with current times . 
  yep . 
  trains , buses , trams , subways and waterbuses country-wide . 
  i do n't think international students get the same perk . 
  in addition to what you mentioned there are some museum discounts . 
  the public transport is where it 's at though , i can travel from groningen to amsterdam and back for free . 
  it 's a blessing . 
  anything outside of amsterdam and keukenhof . 
  the ardeche is the best region of france to visit imo . 
  either not at all or very well . 
  i 've met some german exchange students who blew me away with their skills , some of whom i did n't even realize were foreigners after extended period of speaking . 
  others ( the majority ) do n't bother to learn the language at all . 
  also just in general at student parties , but i 've ( anecdotally ) noticed that the number seems to be decreasing , at least in my social circle . 
  that or polder, 
   snus when i was in norway i was hanging out with some locals and they gave me some of that , i do n't see why it 's so popular to be honest ... all it did was make my lips feel numb . 
  a bike, 
  weerwolven van wakkerdam in dutch ( werewolves of wakkerdam ) . 
  mafia is pretty popular here in the netherlands but it 's called werewolves . 
  also klaas and piet, 
  de ruyter is the most famous dutch war hero , the one from the raid on the medway https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michiel_de_ruyter, 
   but most loud tourists are americans in my personal experience brits and israelis are worse . 
  / r/thenetherlands, 
   like everywhere i guess and hope unfortunately in some developing countries littering is the norm . 
  because the country is called the netherlands . 
  also it was a joke . 
  a lot . 
  i think together with italy we have the most dialects per square km .
