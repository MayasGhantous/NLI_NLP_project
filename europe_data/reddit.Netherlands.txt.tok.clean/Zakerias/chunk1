it has included the figure of the uk rebate which is calculated on the gni figures . 
   the treasury argues that it was not at all clear that the rebate would have been applied in full and they gained that assurance after intensive discussions with the commission . 
   others argue that the uk rebate for next year was never in doubt and that a rebate which the uk would have got anyway is , in effect , being used to reduce this surcharge payment . 
  so basically , they are still paying the whole thing ? 
  am i missing something ? 
  - * edited a word *, 
   the uk 's position could be further weakened by indications that the netherlands - which was hit with a # 600 million surcharge - is ready to go along with the deal . 
  i do n't understand why cameron is putting so much at stake . 
  from what it appears , he 's now shoving his biggest allie on this matter ( the netherlands ) aside , making any political succes practically impossible . 
  the postponing of the payment is a reasonable compromise , for now . 
  i think he 's overplaying his hand by demanding more . 
  he could have used this matter to create a coalition of countries that want extensive european reform . 
  he is now making demands out of selfinterest that can not be fullfilled . 
  because , let 's not fool ourselves , cameron is completely right to complain that this adjustment is ridiculous and counterproductive . 
  his speech is spot on . 
  there is something terribly broken with the current method of delivering the adjusted contribution * one month * before it 's due to be paid . 
  but he wo n't create much support against this by merely focusing on britain 's problems with it . 
  there are many people that would like a less intrusive , more practical form of european government in countries like the netherlands , france , and italy . 
  who all have their own ukips to deal with , because eurosceptiscism is n't something unique to britain . 
  why does n't cameron appeal to those people ? 
  why is he under the impression that the eu ca n't be changed ? 
  perhaps it 's a sign of poor diplomacy , since the uk 's reputation within the eu has n't improved in any way over the past few years . 
  perhaps it 's nothing more than pandering to the nationalistic voters . 
  however one thing is certain to me , cameron could have created something more positive out of this issue , something that would have changed the way the eu operates . 
  if he continues to act like this , he will achieve nothing but a broad grin on farage 's face . 
  ** edit : ** ~ ~ i guess i was wrong : http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29956289~~ ** edit2 : ** i guess i was not wrong , the uk is paying the whole thing . 
  here 's what we can spare : * animal rights party * ( leader is a lawyer who is a seventh-day adventist and denies evolution ) * nationalistic anti-islam/eu party * ( leader is a bleached populist who despises islam ) * party for the elderly * ( leader is a , most likely corrupt , former gay-rights activist ) take your pick . 
  we currently have got 13 parties in parliament , we can surely loose one or two . 
  time will tell . 
  if the eu collapses a few years after a uk exit you 'll definitely be right about this , but when the eu manages to get its act together you could be proven wrong . 
  many analysts predicted that the eurozone would n't survive the 2008 crisis and that countries like greece and spain would get seperated from the union . 
  that did n't happen , so the eu at least was capable to manage * that * crisis . 
  i do agree with you that this was nothing short of a miracle considering the slow bureaucratic way the eu operates . 
  but there is no way of telling what will happen after an exit . 
  to be honest , i hope that the uk changes it 's mind and decides to take a more prominent leadership role within the eu . 
  the last few years it has been pretending that the uk has no influence in europe , and that other countries are just bullies who do n't like brits . 
  which is absolutely insane . 
  if cameron would step up and speak on behalf of the entire eu , he would find out there would be many who 'd support him . 
  his isolationist stance is nothing but fear for his more conservative , nationalistic competition in the elections . 
  it is the global financial centre * now * . 
  but i am certain that without the eu it wo n't be able to keep that position for long . 
  it might remain it 's current postion for several years , maybe even a decade . 
  but when the uk becomes an opponent of the eu , you can be certain that paris , frankfurt and amsterdam will do everything in their power to disrupt london 's position . 
  do n't forget that the combined economy of the eu is much bigger and more powerful than the economy of the uk . 
   this partly depends on the divorce and how the uk re-establishes itself in its relations with the rest of the world . 
  well , i did n't mean that companies would storm out of london . 
  i think that 's mostly scaremongering . 
  in fact , an exit from the eu would hardly come as a surprise by now , so i think that neither the uk or the eu would suffer huge economic consequences from it in the short term . 
  however , companies tend to settle their hq in the place that benefits them the most , since they act practical . 
  without the uk in the eu , the eurozone would be a more logical place to settle for companies that focus on the entire european market . 
  moreso if they want to have a say in brussels . 
  plus , the uk would become a competitor of the eu rather than a partner . 
  policies will be made within the eu that would deliberately damage london . 
  i think it 's safe to say that in time london would become just the uk 's financial centre , rather than europe 's financial centre . 
   who knows what will happen once the uk leaves . 
  it will certainly make life interesting for the netherlands . 
  it will make our position in the eu much , much worse . 
  when it comes to european politics , the uk and the netherlands are big allies . 
  we have similar economies ( international trade & finance ) , similar beliefs in economic policies and restrictions ( manage your damn budget ) , and an similar dislike of micromanagement . 
  if the uk would leave the eu we would lose an important allie , and would be left with germany . 
  the only benefit would be that large ( financial ) companies would be more likely to leave london and settle in amsterdam . 
  basically , there are no two governments . 
  it 's one government with two locations . 
  everything good that happens is because of the national politics , and everything bad is because of brussels . 
  that 's how they spin it everywhere , not just the uk . 
  the main reason is that the media thinks ( and rightfully so ) that european politics are boring . 
  so in each country , the focus lies on national politics , and they get to shift the blame and use the eu as a scapegoat . 
  however , at the same time the most important and influential people within the european government are the leaders of each memberstate . 
  so whenever a national leader is pissed at the eu , it is very much likely they share a part of that responsibility . 
  i have a decent unbiased source ( nos , the dutch public television news ) that explains some things , but it is in dutch : http://nos.nl/artikel/713479-vijf-vragen-over-de-eunaheffing.html some points from the article : * fees are calculated based on the bbp , the way to calculate this changes every few years * the new way of calculating the fee was first announced in 2010 * it is not just because of the inclusion of the ` shadow economy ' , things like prostitution , drugs , etc. 
  things like research and development are also included in the new method * the numbers are based on the calculations of the national central statistics bureau of each country , basically each country provides their own figures . 
  i fully agree . 
  mind you , we dutch got a relatively similar bill to pay . 
  i think it completely counterproductive to punish countries for being able to manage their budget during a fucking crisis and having some economic stability . 
  that is not how you spread the idea that having a decent budget is a good thing . 
  however , i do n't blame the eu for this , i blame our pm for accepting these terms to begin with . 
  and the uk should do the same . 
  cameron ( or at least his minister of finance , in that case : his cabinet ) accepted these terms and was aware of this . 
  he should get the blame for not standing up against it beforehand . 
  i do n't think the uk gets a chance to leave . 
  i think it 's more likely france and germany will kick the uk out of the eu before they get a chance to hold a referendum . 
  the uk simply is n't a team player , and the rest of europe is annoyed with the uk constantly claiming to be the victim . 
  after that happens , it 's just a matter of time before the lunatics like lepen , wilders and grillo fuck up what 's left of it . 
  europe is being plagued by weak leaders , with cameron and hollande as the two worst . 
  i do n't see him getting a discount at all . 
  maybe a very small one , but nothing that would make him look like a winner . 
  cameron 's mistake is that he is way too aggressive in his approach to this news . 
  he was furious and baffled by it . 
  and the latter is a little bit silly . 
  rutte , the dutch pm , said he was aware that this extra payment was possible , but that he was a somewhat surprised about the amount . 
  he calmy stated that he would try to fight this outcome . 
  the difference with cameron is that rutte is fully aware that it is likely that he will not get a discount . 
  let 's get this clear : * they all agreed to these new calculations and the possibility of an extra payment . 
  * they all knew this was about to happen . 
  i do n't believe cameron can negotiate a discount because aside from the uk : the netherlands , and to a lesser extent italy and greece , also have to pay . 
  if the uk gets special treatment , the others will also want special treatment . 
  if they all get special treatment on this , italy will want special treatment on their budget . 
  france will want special treatment on the 3 % norm . 
  basically , special treatment will put a bomb on the current economic restictions , making the eu once again vulnerable . 
  thatcher might have pulled this off in the eighties , but cameron lacks the charisma , negotiating skills and political climate .
