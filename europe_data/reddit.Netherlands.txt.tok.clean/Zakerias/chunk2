  in the eighties , thatcher was the conservative hardliner . 
  currently , cameron is fighting the conservative hardliner . 
  he is afraid , she was feared . 
  by the way , this saddens me enormously . 
  i find it terrible that the uk does n't consider it 's role in eu vital for it 's succes . 
  there is constant talk about france and germany both deciding for all of the eu . 
  but the uk is * letting * them do that by being a drama queen and unreasonably sceptical about everything concerning brussels . 
  ** team benelux ** * ( belgium , netherlands , luxemburg ) * total population : 28 million active military : 75.000 troops fit for service : about 11.000.000 military budget : 11,5 billion euro ** - * versus * - ** ** team nordic ** * ( norway , sweden , finland , denmark & iceland ) * total population : 26 million active military : 120.000 troops fit for service : about 8.000.000 military budget : 19 billion euro i guess we 're going to need some allies for this one . 
  we would be # 1 at so many things , if it were n't for them meddling nordics ... 
  well , that 's the difference i guess . 
  i can only speak for the netherlands and over here it 's not just one generation ago , but many generations since christianity was the sole source of morality . 
  the stat that shows the ` belief in god is required to have morality ' is the most telling for me , because it is something very american to agree with . 
  the netherlands used to be very segregated and very orderned . 
  a hundred years ago our country was basically divided into four pillars : christians , catholics , liberals and socialists . 
  they each cared for their own group , they had their own newspapers , radio stations , unions and political parties . 
  over time , they were forced to cooperate on various levels . 
  catholics formed coalition governments with socialist and liberals . 
  religious groups were fused together as the overal religious population shrunk and the various unions realised they were stronger if they worked together . 
  most people within these four pillars slowly realized that being a good person has little to do with political or religious beliefs . 
  they started looking looking at eachothers beliefs and realized there was much common ground . 
  cooperation and ` reaching across the aisle ' has and will be rewarded by voters . 
  nowadays , exposing someone powerful because of their personal beliefs or lifestyle ( wether it be atheism or any form of religion ) is very much frowned upon through all layers of society . 
  example : our current liberal prime-minister is single and a catholic . 
  this information is completely irrelevant for his job performance , no one in the opposition will ever use either aspect for political gain . 
  on the other hand , our pm will never use the word god in a speech and all party leaders are very reluctant to use their family to increase their popularity . 
  giving in to either one of those things would be political suicide . 
  when i look at the us , being a christian and using it for popularity to advance your career is pretty much mandatory . 
  i fully understand why this stings people that are atheist or something other than christian . 
  cheap aldi rum ( steuerrad , i guess it 's called ? ), 
  is decent enough to mix with cola . 
  and it 's much , much better than something like captain morgan . 
  that stuff is absolutely disgusting , it tastes like liquid chewing gum . 
  that was the last time i bought something for it 's cool label . 
  i just reread it , nevermind, 
  who needs mountains anyway ? 
  you ca n't build polders there . 
  let 's do lowest points next . 
  [ ours is at -6,74 m ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/monument_laagste_punt_van_nederland.jpg/800px-monument_laagste_punt_van_nederland.jpg ), 
  i did n't mean that statistically . 
  i have no idea about the percentages for who oppose or support it , but when i look at the media i think the discussion is quite balanced . 
  it 's not exactly lopsided where 95 % agrees or disagrees . 
  and i agree with you on the second part . 
  it 's not any of my business , or the governments business to decide for people how to live their lives . 
  however , i also think that there are many people outside the netherlands who understand this viewpoint , but we tend to ignore that praise because we simply do n't care about it that much . 
  well , the bike thing is something that dutch people are genuinely proud of when it is mentioned in foreign press . 
  i guess the flat lands helps , seeing as denmark also has a excellent cycling system . 
  but when i look at countries like the us or southern europe i am often amazed at how little effort is made to make cycling safe , and how it 's considered more as an activity as opposed to a valid means of transportation . 
  since we consider ourselves a gigantic small country , we are either disappointed for not being mentioned or disappointed that the outside world does not understand us . 
  either way , dutch media/people are terrible at damage control and tend to spin everything to their benefit . 
  this is a defence mechanism that is common when talking to dutch people . 
  for example : the whole zwarte piet ( black pete ) discussion is considered by most dutch people as an internal affair that the rest of the world simply does n't understand . 
  the national discussion is tense , with about as many people opposing changes as there are people supporting changes to the holiday . 
  however , both sides mostly agree that any ` outsider ' opinion is completely irrelevant . 
  which leads to many people abroad thinking of us as ` in denial ' . 
  it is a complex issue , but we could be a little more understanding about how it is perceived in other countries . 
  second example : the amount of gold medals we won during the winter olympics was ridiculous . 
  25 medals for speed skating only , completely obliterating the opposition . 
  it raised some doubt among other countries if the event was still worthwhile , since there was barely any competition . 
  this point of view was ridiculed by most dutch media and people , changing the argument into ` get on our level , rest of the world ' while mocking the failure of both germany and the us . 
  though there is some argument for a international sport event lacking any form of competition . 
  third example : we tend to dislike the cliched ` most liberal country ever ' when it is brought by foreign people . 
  for example , english people often instantly mentioning drugs & hookers when talking about amsterdam . 
  the likely reaction of a dutch person is ` we do n't all smoke pot , you know !, 
  we have a lot of art ! ' . 
  however , it is also very likely that a dutch person will boast about this , ` high tolarence , poldermodel , best health care , first country to have gay marriage , et cetera ' . 
  in short , we 're good at boasting and bad at compliments . 
  i 'm exaggerating of course . 
  most of these things are from what i 've heard from foreign people that i know . 
  i guess the main thing is that we are a lot more chauvenistic then we think we are . 
  i get what you mean , since canada abolished the penny not so long ago , and some countries in europe have also done this ( netherlands , belgium & finland ) . 
  however , within europe there is also a lot of difference between the prices of goods . 
  i do n't know much about lithuania , but i suppose groceries over there are cheaper than here in the netherlands , because the wages and cost of living are lower . 
  so the usefullness of the 1 and 2 cent coins is different from country to country . 
  i ca n't think of a thing i could buy with 1 or 2 cents in the netherlands . 
  besides , upon joining the eurozone it 's nice to have the complete set , even when they are n't that usefull . 
  [ queen juliana ] ( http://fast.mediamatic.nl/f/tqgr/image/349/245625-400-500.jpg ) [ queen beatrix ] ( http://afbeeldingen.gahetna.nl/naa/thumb/500x500/7a3bb9de-2854-d5b4-f1b1-725810eacd2b.jpg ) [ king willem-alexander ] ( http://www.janwijten.com/willemalexander.jpg ) at least our royals can hold their own umbrellas . 
  ( the first one even has a text that says ` rain , how lovely ! ' ), 
  they are actually down 25 % in number of voters ( from 20,1 % of the total votes in the 2010 european election to 15.3 % in 2014 ) . 
  they 'll celebrate this as a victory , because they 're up since the last national election . 
  the actual big change happened with pvda & vvd . 
  those two combined got more than 50 % of the total votes in the national election . 
  now , their combination gets just over 20 % of the total vote . 
  i 'm not british , but i know that that your point simply is n't true and quite denigrating to ** most ** brits . 
  everyone follows charismatic and entertaining leaders . 
  all politicians are able to tell you bullshit . 
  this is n't something that only applies to ` daily mail readers ' or ukip votes . 
  when it comes to opinions you should disagree with someones opinion , not with the newspaper they read . 
  the only reason you said that the op was a ` daily mail reader ' is because that newspaper has a reputation of being a tabloid known for gutter news and simplified loud obnoxious headlines . 
  basically you told the op that he was stupid , because ( you think ) he reads a stupid newspaper . 
  just because someone disagrees with you does n't mean that they are stupid . 
  edit : [ voting by newspaper readership 1992-2010 in britain ] ( http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2476/voting-by-newspaper-readership-19922010.aspx?view=wide ) quite diverse , is n't it ? 
  just as all americans are either redneck inbred fundamentalists who only watch fox , or hippy gayloving vegans that only watch msnbc . 
  / s those stereotypes are incredibly stupid . 
  do n't confuse people 's opinions with what media they might consume . 
  i just voted for the d66 ( dutch democratic liberals ) for three reasons : 1 . 
  i want the eu to change to become more open and democratic . 
  i 've just voted for the alde , even though the party never campaigned under that name in my country . 
  the current eu lacks transparancy , is overweight ( the redundant meetings in strasbourg for example ) and lacks true representation . 
  the union should also be benificial to people on more than just the economic level . 
  the main complaint in my country is not that people hate the eu , but that they do not notice any benefit from being in the eu and notice only the disadvantages .
