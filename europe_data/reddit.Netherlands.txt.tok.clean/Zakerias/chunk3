  i want a strong , united eu on matters that nations ca n't accomplish on their own . 
  ( energy market , military power , immigration , net neutrality , online privacy rights , research and education ) but i also want countries to have independence when it comes to social laws , cultural and economic subsidies and ethical matters . 
  i do n't believe that people either love or hate europe , even though that is the popular spin from the media . 
  parties like ukip , pvv or other parties that are sceptical of the eu are not that different from the american tea party . 
  and you ca n't say that the tea party hates america . 
  it is only against increased federal power . 
  although according to the media my vote would be considered ` pro-europe ' , i 'm not against independence on certain issues , nor am i obedient to an eu that makes all the rules . 
  just as sceptics are n't against any form of coorparation between countries . 
  in fact , i would be heavily opposed if the average of europe could decide things like euthanasia , prostitution , gay marriage or drug laws . 
  what i see is people that lost faith that the eu will ever become a succesful project , and people that want the eu to change to become more succesful . 
  according to [ this article ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/binnenland/article/detail/3657271/2014/05/19/nederlandse-experts-bieden-balkan-steun-bij-watersnood.dhtml ) two cargo planes arrived with food , generators and supplies on sunday , along with two dutch disaster specialists . 
  i have euronews and i have basic cable . 
  ` no comment ' is nice , but it 's not a channel that i watch regularly . 
  it has the least sexy logo ever created . 
  no need to apologise . 
   the root of the problem for the lengthy negotiations is similar for both belgium and the netherlands . 
  because both have anti-eu / anti-islam parties that gained a great amount of votes during the last few years , in the form of the pvv and the vlaams belang . 
  in belgium there is a ` cordon sanitaire ' , which made forming a majority a lot more difficult . 
  they also have a lot of trouble managing the language problems , but i 'm not very informed on the issue . 
  the netherlands even had a political assassination to deal with in 2002 . 
  so while it is true that our political systems are prone to long lengthy talks after elections , it was exceptional in recent years for various reasons . 
  also : i just took that list from wikipedia . 
  my bad !, 
  you are greatly exaggerating . 
  in the last decade there was an abnormal amount of difficulty concerning the formation process , but generally speaking , the formation of coalitions only takes a few months . 
  these months are n't lost time , because the formation process is part of creating a sustainable government that can create long term goals , without too much ideological narrative . 
  it serves as a way to make long term planning on a national scale easier . 
  as for the norm : i agree that a system with party list representation would n't work on a european level , but for a smaller country like the netherlands it works fine . 
  one of the best things of it is that it 's very easy to have a brand new party compete on a national level . 
  this prevents that power is divided between two huge parties that fight over the same undecided electorate ( like tories or labour , or democrats or republicans ) . 
  this makes representation on an ideological level more diverse . 
  one of the negatives is that anyone can compete fairly easy . 
  that is why we had parties like the farmers party , the elderly party , the pacifist party and several extreme right parties in the past . 
  currently there is an animal rights party and a party for people who are above 50 years of age . 
  silly , of course . 
  but also very democratic . 
  edit : also , these are the other countries that have party list proportional representation , with or without a threshold : * albania , algeria , angola , austria , argentina , aruba , belgium , bosnia and herzegovina , brazil , bulgaria , burkina faso , burundi , cambodia , cape verde , colombia , costa rica , croatia , cura\u00e7ao , cyprus , czech republic , denmark , dominican republic , equatorial guinea , estonia , finland , guinea-bissau , guyana , hong kong , iceland , indonesia , iraq , israel , italy , latvia , liberia , liechtenstein , lithuania , luxembourg , mexico , moldova , montenegro , morocco , namibia , nepal , new caledonia , nicaragua , norway , paraguay , peru , poland , portugal , russia , san marino , sao tome and principe , serbia , sint maarten , slovakia , slovenia , south africa , spain , sri lanka , suriname , sweden , switzerland , tunisia , turkey , uruguay , wallis and futuna * so i would n't call constituencies the norm . 
  this is not how dutch national elections work . 
  we do n't have constituencies like the uk . 
  we have party lists , and you can vote for anyone on the party list regardless where they are from within the country . 
  this is the main reason our political landscape consists of so many political parties . 
  currently , there are 11 parties in the tweede kamer . 
  ( and after tonight several independent members , because of the collapse of the pvv ) according to / u/thereaperr 's question , the logic here is : ** local elections ** -  you should be able to vote for local politicians , from anywhere within your * gemeente * ( municipality ) . 
  ** national elections ** -  you should be able to vote for national politicians , from anywhere within the country . 
  ** european elections ** -  you should be able to vote for european politicians , from anywhere within europe . 
  this is logical to most dutch people , because our national elections do n't have ` forced ' geographical representation like the uk or the us . 
  they leave the responsability to parties to make sure everyone from everywhere within the country is represented . 
  we did n't have any problems with this because of the relatively small size of the netherlands . 
  recently we saw some outcry for better representation from areas in the south and the north , where many people feel they are n't equally represented . 
  i do n't think this could work on a european level , because of it 's size and risk of lack of representation from less populated countries . 
  although i personally also think the system is awkward and not very democratic . 
  i do n't have much to add other than that the whole protest and the situation in ukraine is widely covered in the dutch media , i just watched a * nieuwsuur * item explaining the entire situation with much detail . 
  i 've seen a lot of comments of people that are upset about the lack of coverage ( although , most of these are about american media ) . 
  i 'm kind of interested in how much coverage it gets in other countries . 
  seeing this tragedy and the abuse of basic human rights so close to home is something that should be a concern for everyone in europe . 
  i think is it 's shame what is happening and i wish nothing but the best for the people of ukraine . 
  i do n't know if joining the eu will solve the economic problems , but at least the people deserve to live in a country that is independent and democratic . 
  i 'm deeply concerned that this situation could lead to a civil war . 
  mostly because the eu currently lacks the leadership , willpower or authority to intervene . 
  the only country truly able to do something is britain , but given the sentiment among the public there to both the eu and eastern europe i doubt they could act with force . 
  let 's hope it wo n't come to that . 
  it 's a great list you made . 
  but i see these people more as famous people , than as actual heroes ( with the exception of william the silent & michiel de ruyter ) . 
  here a some lesser known people , famous for their heroic deeds : ** erik hazelhoff roelfzema ** dutch spy during the second world war . 
  in the netherlands he became famous as the writer of the 1970 book soldaat van oranje ( dutch : soldier of orange ) in which he describes his experiences in world war ii , and which was made into a 1977 film directed by paul verhoeven and starring rutger hauer . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erik_hazelhoff_roelfzema ** jan van speijk ** a dutch naval lieutenant who became a hero for opposition to the belgian revolution . 
  he is known for the words he said during the capture of his ship in the antwerp port : ` i 'd rather be blow up ' . 
  after which he stuck his cigar in the gunpowder storage of his ship causing a massive explosion . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_van_speijk ** walraven van hall ** a dutch banker and resistance leader during the occupation of the netherlands in world war ii . 
  one of the ways in which van hall raised funds for the resistance was the `` robbing '' of the dutch national bank . 
  with the approval of the dutch government-in-exile , the van halls managed to obtain as much as 50 million dutch guilders . 
  ( comparable to half a billion euros nowadays ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walraven_van_hall ** aletta jacobs ** the first woman to complete a university course in 1878 in the netherlands and the first female physician . 
  she helped initiate the hague congress of 1915 that led to the formation of the women 's international league for peace and freedom ( wilpf ) and also worked to support the international woman suffrage alliance . 
  an important figure for gender equality . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aletta_jacobs ** hannie schaft ** a dutch communist resistance fighter during world war ii . 
  she became known as * the girl with the red hair * . 
  http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/hannie_schaft ** walter s\u00fcskind ** a german jew of dutch parents who helped about 600 jewish children escape the holocaust . 
  he was a member of the dutch jewish council during the second world war . 
  fully agree with you . 
  i think the best thing is that this thread gives a great overview what the mainstream media in my country considers newsworthy in international news . 
  i also like reading about the many smaller issues and discussions that are happening in other countries . 
  i did n't realize the whole `` gender roles in toy store catalogues '' was such a widespread debate . 
  this should be a weekly topic called `` this week in europe '' or something like that . 
   `` i hope more people stop voting . '', 
   `` henceforth , voting is essentially a meaningless activity and at the end of the day it matters little who or what wins an election . '', 
  you want more indifference . 
  you think voting is meaningless . 
  that is literally what you said in your first comment . 
  and i disagree completely . 
  voting matters , just look at parties like die gr\u00fcnen , ukip , and even smaller parties like the pirate party or the animal rights party that have changed policies and general approach of bigger parties to the public . 
  this is a result of voting for these parties . 
  like i said , not voting is n't a sin or a crime . 
  i 've not voted because i did n't feel represented . 
  but that is n't an excuse or a reason to glorify ` not voting ' . 
  not being represented during elections is a terrible thing . 
  revolutions are bloody . 
  to me , the only valid use of a revolution is if a system is corrupt , or to overthrow a dictatorship . 
  both do n't apply to any western democracy . 
  i could n't make any sense of the second half of your comment . 
  what is the alternative to democracy that you propose ?
