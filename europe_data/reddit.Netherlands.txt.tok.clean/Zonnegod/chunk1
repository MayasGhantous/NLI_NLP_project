you act like the only reason to try and stay under the 30 % was to hope that the no-camp did n't win . 
  a huge reason was to express discontent about having a referendum about this ludicrous topic . 
  i read the result of this referendum as follows : 68 % of people did n't want a referendum about this and preferred our parliament to decide it for them , 10 % wanted to ratify the agreement , 22 % wanted to overturn the ratification . 
  so sure , the no-camp won the referendum , but it is clear that the `` we should n't have referenda about this bullshit '' - camp has made it clear that we should stop all this populist referendum nonsense for the indefinite future . 
  why are they stupid ? 
  note that this was the ** first ** referendum under this new referendum law . 
  by not voting , many people also showed their discontent with having referendum about these ridiculous topics . 
  you could see the 68 % of people not going as 68 % of people voting against having referenda like these . 
  you really have to keep in mind that this referendum was hijacked by the populists here and even the people organizing the referendum said that they '' [ do n't care about ukraine ] ( http://www.nrc.nl/next/2016/03/31/oekraine-kan-ons-niets-schelen-1606419 ) '' . 
  the main question people had in mind when thinking about this referendum was not `` what should i vote for ? 
  '' , it was `` why the fuck are we having a referendum about this ? 
  the strategic voting was n't idiotic ; it is a legitimate way to reach the goal . 
  the way the referendum was set up was idiotic, 
  oops !, 
  fixed . 
  but even without the strategic voting against the threshold : disagreeing with the referendum because the parliament has already voted on it implies that you want the parliament to be making the decision instead of the individual voter . 
  so i think it 's fair to count these people to whatever side the parliament voted on , which happened to be * yes * . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're trying to say . 
  although the no-voters may be shouting that this outcome represents the opinion of the dutch population , even you yourself know that many potential yes-voters consciously decided not to go to the polls . 
  and you also understand that the proportions of votes that came out of the referendum in no way represent the proportions of a referendum in which everyone had voted . 
  let alone a referendum which was actually about the topic that was voted on , and not turned into an anti-government , anti-eu propaganda tool for the populists . 
  it would require that about 70 % of the non-voters would vote to ratify the agreement , which does not seem so unlikely to me * at all * . 
  why are all the people against the referendum trying to deny that there were huge incentives to not vote ? 
  of the maybe 30 people i spoke to about the referendum , the large majority said they would did not / would not vote because they either believed it was ridiculous that we were asked to vote on a matter on which our parliament had already voted * yes * , or because they did n't want the referendum to get above 30 % . 
  the 32 % participation rate just shows how much people disagree with having a referendum about this . 
  and do n't come with your `` but it was above the 30 % threshold '' , because we all know that it is some completely arbitrary proportion , which was a stupid idea in hindsight because it gives an incentive not to vote . 
  boy you seem salty . 
  did a dutchman give you a salty piece of drop , telling you it would be tasty or something ? 
   and 30 % of non voters , the majority wait wait , when i was in school ,  50 % used to mean a majority . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/bartnijman/status/718099899527643136 ) poll , only 30 % of the people thought that the government would do nothing with the vote . 
  it 's safe to say the majority of the people did n't vote because they did n't care/didn ' t look into it or purposefully abstained to show their dislike of the referendum . 
   these are mostly against voters . 
  why are these mostly against voters ? 
  i also believe the government will do nothing with it , and it would have been an argument for me not to go ( i did vote myself ) . 
  however , i trust our government is competent enough to recognize that this referendum was one big clown show . 
  sure , many people , including myself , have some concerns about the eu . 
  i think the against-voters have been able to signal their discontent with the status quo using this referendum . 
  but i also believe our government will understand that the outcome should not be taken seriously . 
  [ woosh ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/992/401/e37.png ), 
  it 's only 27 % saying that though ... 
  so , for all we know , 73 % could have thought that the government will do something with the result . 
  you 're being ** extremely ** misleading by saying  polls suggest that most people stayed home because they did n't expect the government to do something , not because they lacked interest . 
  for telling foreigners the truth about how ridiculous this referendum was ? 
  there were probably plenty of people voting against the association agreement who had well thought and honest concerns about the whole thing . 
  but there is no arguing that the referendum was not hijacked by the populists to turn it into an anti-status quo , anti-eu show . 
  what 's incorrect about it ? 
  32.2 % participation and 61.1 % voted against the agreement : 0.322 * 0.611 = 0.197 . 
  or are we talking rounding errors ? 
  you obviously have no clue about what kind of ridiculous show the referendum was here . 
  first of all , only 20 % of the eligible voters voted against the referendum . 
  a huge amount of people stayed home to show that they did not agree with holding referenda like these . 
  second of all , the referendum was just a huge cry for attention by a populist website and their associates . 
  their frontrunner happily talked about how he did not even read the content of the referendum . 
  additionally , the people who initially started the referendum stated that they [ `` do n't care about ukraine '' ] ( http://www.nrc.nl/next/2016/03/31/oekraine-kan-ons-niets-schelen-1606419 ) , admitting that the referendum was just a `` because we can '' stunt . 
  finally , suppose that this would have been a serious referendum with a 90 % participation and 80 % vote against the agreement . 
  in that scenario , i strongly doubt the eu would dare to alienate the dutch population , in addition to giving a huge boost to anti-eu parties across the continent . 
  are we already being listed with the inselaffen when it comes to our opinion about the eu ? 
  most of the dutch anti-eu sentiment is caused by anti-status quo scare tactics and fake promises by the populists . 
  note that only 20 % of the eligible voters voted against the agreement . 
  i am sure that most of the remaining 80 % is glad to see that the rest of the eu nations will ignore this clown fiesta of a referendum . 
  64 % of the 32 % that voted . 
  note that not only was there little incentive to vote for the people who agreed with the referendum , but there was also an incentive to not-vote : by not voting , there was a decent chance the 30 % threshold would not be reached . 
  if everyone would have voiced their opinion , i am convinced it would have been closer to 60 % -40 % in favour of ratifying the association agreement . 
   arabs i doubt the persians / sassanids would call themselves arabs . 
  if it 's capable of detecting people obstructing its path , i 'm sure it can detect people on the side of the road waiting to be picked up . 
  making this clear should only quicken negotiations : it 's just up for the uk now to decide whether they value single market access more than denying freedom of movement . 
  the eu has a lot more bargaining power so they can basically set the terms . 
  that 's when the undivided voters are excluded . 
  i say the header should have said `` 45 % back brexit and 13 % are undecided '' , but as the undecided often go for the status quo , it 's unfair to just eliminate them altogether as you are suggesting . 
  it does n't get much better so far . . 
  drama about fisheries , while the documentary happily ignores the huge overfishing . 
  the eu is not paying british fishermen to destroy their boats out of spite , they 're paying them to discourage overfishing . 
  the part that comes after it has me really confused . 
  it 's criticizing the uk governments for putting in restrictions in the economy and blocking foreign trade . 
  it starts praising post-war germany for relieving restrictions and allowing free trade with other nations against the advice of the uk . 
  then suddenly entering an open market with other european nations is a bad because `` bureaucracy '' ? 
  they do n't even go into why this legislation was thought to be necessary , nor do they really explain what 's bad about it . 
  heck , they do n't even mention what it is about . 
  just that it 's a lot of paperwork and paperwork is boring so it must be bad . 
  they only give a list of examples about `` eu rules '' : '' * what vacuum cleaner you 've got , where you get your hair cut , what kind of size your shoes are * '' [ at ~ 32:10 ] . 
  are they trying to mislead people into thinking that this is regulated by the eu ? 
  the statistics about eu regulations that products are subjected to are incredibly misleading as well . 
  if you start counting trade deals with every country int he world , of course it stacks up . 
  [ here ] ( http://img.prntscr.com/img?url=http://i.imgur.com/82fz3wc.png ) is a screenshot from the documentary , mentioning regulations which include towels . 
  in reality , they 're mostly trade agreements with countries about textile quality . 
  and it 's not as if these regulations would disappear if the uk leaves the eu . 
  especially not if they want to have free trade with the eu or us . 
  i 've only watched the first 11 minutes so far , but this is such a populist piece of propaganda , purposely presenting misleading facts . 
  - '' * nobody knows how it works * '' . 
  this says more about the people 's own disinterest , but they 're pretending like the eu is purposely making things complex to hide what they 're doing . 
  really , it 's not that complex : - eur . 
  council : prime ministers/presidents meet up ; - eur . 
  parliament : guys we vote for every 5 years ; - eur . 
  commission : 1 representative elected by each nation ; - council of the eu : topic-related ministers of countries meet up . 
  i honestly do n't see which of these institutes should be eliminated . 
  - '' * who 's in charge ? * '' . 
  again , this is simply the people 's ignorance about how the eu works . 
  in the netherlands , our commissioner is very well known to the people . 
  - '' * people in charge * '' . 
  this is so misleading .
