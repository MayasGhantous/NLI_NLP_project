try the primark . 
  very popular/fashionable among teenage girls . 
  i do n't know . 
  it might , it might not . 
  i think you could have just as much success in a modern day girly dress though . 
  hi , i 'm the guy that send the dutch volendammer clothing , and please be reminded that this is traditional clothing , worn for tourists . 
  rotterdam is not a typical tourist destination , and you wo n't see the traditional clothing there . 
  there are 50.000 people in normal jeans , skirts , or dresses for every person in a traditional clothing you 'll see . 
  that being said , we do n't really care about how other people look either . 
  yes , you 'll draw some attention in a hanbok . 
  no , it wo n't be totally weird . 
  more something you do n't see everyday . 
  kinda in the same situation . 
  but in my case historical games sparked the interest . 
  foreign cultures always seem weird , especially when nations are becoming more and more similair in things like clothing . 
  nothing to be scared of . 
  wood floats , the netherlands is under water , dutch do n't wan na drown . 
  need i say more ? 
  i have no explanation for the dutch cap though . 
  i guess it just kept your ears warm . 
  coming from the guy from a country where they wear litterally a cylinder with a tail as a hat , 
  [ yeah , i only knew any of that from wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_hair#use_of_term_in_singapore_and_malaysia ) , so you 're probably right . 
  while i do post on / r/shitamericanssay , remember most americans are not like that . 
  dutch girls are quitte sexy ... but i guess that 's not really fair to say as a dutch person . 
  i just have something for hot blondes , and the netherlands suits me perfectly . 
  though appearantly , the chinese and japanese words for foreigner mean red hair , from the red hair dutch traders had . 
  never knew red hair was so common here . 
  i 'm always fascinated by asian history . 
  the yuan , ming , and qing china , the daimyo system in japan , the non-unified indian states , the timurinds and mughals , the mongols , the ottomans , asian history fascinates me . 
  there truelly is a divide between east and west , and that 's a good thing . 
  many asian countries have such a beatiful culture , so different from the european cultures ( and even other asian cultures ) . 
  ^ ( though the point where european and asian cultures start to meet is not really a beautiful point in history ... ), 
  it 's strange to read `` too big and too diverse '' without someone trying to justify something america does wrong . 
  well , we , the dutch , have [ this ] ( http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/141857064-girl-in-dutch-national-costume-alkmaar-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=iwsasset&amp;k=2&amp;d=ksqdwdzehqcwjuccfqczzopowqvphdus0ozkru3jwx8%3d ) if that 's your kinda thing . 
  that 's a traditional outfit though , and only worn for tourists , so i may have missed the `` not very looking older ones '' - requirement . 
  well , these are the guys for whom resorting to godwins law is totally valid . 
  america might still try to bring you democracy . 
  dunno , they now want his resignation . 
  this is n't just about the internet tax . 
  its also a hegelian model of a thesis , the exact opposite , and a golden way in the middle . 
  60s and 70s where politically very active and positive , the nirvana generation negative and less politically active , and the new generation exists of easy to anger slacktivists . 
  we chose our own monarch in a unique republic form , so there 's that . 
  and its still not acceptable . 
  if you want to introduce a 100 euro tax , tell people you 're going to introduce a million euro tax , and when they protest , scale it down to a 100 euro tax . 
  everybody is glad they now only get taxed a small portion of the original plan . 
  except that that 's is n't and should n't be how it works . 
  people do n't fall for it , and should n't accept this tax just because it seems more reasonable . 
  stay in power !, 
  stay in power !, 
  `` some specific jews feel threated in the bad parts of paris '' . 
  i 'm sorry , but please do n't do this . 
  yes , we should do something about this . 
  no , this is not sufficient evidence that jews in western europe are in any way threathened . 
  a good man realizes which battle should be his battle , like racism , and which battle should n't be . 
  not every fight is worth a war , sometimes you got ta let things sort themselves out . 
  not in case of racism . 
  the battle of the black man is a war of equality , and concerns all of us . 
  the war in the middle east , however , has no moral higher side . 
  that 's not a battle for all of us . 
  it has become somewhat of a cheap excuse from the israeli goverment to cry anti-semitism at every step . 
  even saying what i just said might get you accused of ... anti-semitism . 
  except you fight anti-semitism where there is none and claim you are fighting the good fight . 
  fight on , help anti-semitism out of this world , but not in this way , not like this . 
  then stop fighting another mans battle and telling them how hard their battles are . 
  stop that . 
  you really ca n't claim you feel unsafe for something like that . 
  nowadays , the jewish in western europe are n't persecuted . 
  provide hard evidence or stop the victim complex . 
  i 'm just kidding . 
  i hate it when americans bring up ww2 as if we should be grateful to them , because that 's simply not true , we where liberated by the canadians ( america did participate in operation market garden though ) . 
  i live close to zeist , where the canadians celebrated the liberation in hotel figi . 
  let me tell you that the eldery from zeist are nothing but positive about the canadian liberation , where chocolate is always brought up ( the canadians handed out chocolate to the liberated dutch to celebrate ) . 
  [ we still send tulips every single year to thank canada for everything the canadians did in world war two . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadian_tulip_festival#trivia ) in other words , dutch-canadian relation have , and always will be , very warm . 
  i 'd even dare to say that canada is the netherlands greatest non-european friend . 
  the annexation of the netherlands , annexing austria based upon cultural simularity was what the nazi party did . 
  and putin is doing . 
  the netherlands have been independant from the holy roman empire since the 1600s , if you even consider the holy roman empire a predecessor state of a unified germany . 
  so a german claim to the netherlands does n't really hold any ground . 
  the name `` the netherlands '' or `` niederlande '' or `` nederland '' or `` pays-bas '' all mean the same thing ( the french one is just a literal translation ) ; the low ( nieder means low ) lands . 
  however , lowlands would be a dutch festival , not a reference to the netherlands . 
  the low countries are the benelux , the netherlands , belgium , and luxembourg . 
  [ to awnser your question . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jasmj/legality_of_samesex_activity_in_europe_history/cla0yvn ) to respond to your claim on the netherlands ; easy there , hitler . 
  because we do n't have a word for dutch . 
  dutch in dutch is nederlands , and then we would be back where we started . 
  i ; m sorry , that was rude . 
  we love our frysian friends like the flemish love their wallonian friends . 
  easy there , canada . 
  [ did you forget we ~ ~ temporarly annexed ~ ~ made you surrender parts of canada in ww2 ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/princess_margriet_of_the_netherlands#birth_and_canada ) we would n't want to see that happening a second time now , eh ? 
  ah no , okay , i looked it up , and it 's never used in german , so that 's absoutely correct . 
  except literally , of course , because nieder means low, 
  that would n't alliterate , now would it ? 
  yes , just you . 
  cgp grey , i ment , the guy who makes videos and did that think about the difference between the netherlands , the kingdom of the netherlands , holland , and the provinces . 
  he did the same thing with the difference between the commonwealth , great brittain , the united kingdom , and england . 
  literally , it means : the low countries . 
  however , since neder is dutch for lower , and land is dutch for ... land , nederland also means the low countries . 
  so its a literal translation of our name .
