  that 's not unfair or undeserved , so yeah , prime / r/shiteuropeansay . 
  no , that 's exaggeration . 
  the us is n't that bad as a superpower , but could be doing a lot better . 
  country of hookers , electromusic , beer and drugs and you accuse us of being bad party goers ? 
  that 's even better - correcting it now, 
  mississippi was n't a right comparison . 
  mississippi often ranks dead last on lists of how well a us state is doing in a certain aspect , so the americans in the 49th state often proclaim `` thank god for mississippi '' - meaning `` i 'm glad there 's that one us state that 's a total shithole , because it means we 're not the worst state '' . 
  but america is not a shithole , it just has weird ideology . 
  i should 've used florida - a state where the people are considered pretty bizarre when compared to other states . 
  the right to shoot toddlers is a hyperbole . 
  after the sandy hooks massacre , it was clear that gun rights are way more important in the us than the lives of toddlers . 
  if the death of dozens of children are n't enough to justify constraining gun rights , than you 've crossed the final boundary . 
  nothing ever will be enough to constrain gun rights . 
  also that . 
  never party with a belgian either - they 're not hardcore partygoers , but their heavy drinking due to their sad existence means they will outdrink you . 
  i imagine it to be either pretty glossy , like wiping your ass with plastic film , or pretty coarse , like wiping your ass with sandpaper . 
  i do n't want any of that grey recycled crap . 
  i want triple ply perfumed deluxe paper with [ puppers ] ( http://www.pagepuppy.nl/img/products/page-dubbel-lang.jpg?v=2 ) on it . 
   a group made entirely of soft spoken and well mannered folk who told you that ? 
  it 's well known among dutch partygoers that you should never party with a brit - because only other brits can keep up with them . 
  they 're easily the most loud and obnoxious kind of tourist in amsterdam . 
  still love brits , though . 
    do n't worry you 're still way worse . 
   not anymore . 
  a modern , western country that calls itself heaven of freedom but has a oligarchic two-party system with political dynasties ? 
  a modern , western country that decided that the right to shoot toddlers is infallible ? 
  a neo-liberal , neo-colonialist , imperialist , interventionist superpower that still considers itself the best thing that ever happened to the world ? 
  britains are only temporarily a joke , americans have always been the texas of the western world . 
  worst superpower ever . 
  the third lynx is really sheltered in and never leaves his mother 's basement . 
  belgian kongo was never part of belgium , since it was a crown colony . 
  * edit : it was integrated into belgium later and belgium also lost what is now dutch limburg . 
  sure , both red-white-blue . 
  difference is way more noticeable in the luxembourg flag . 
  but they 're not identical . 
  they did n't , there are subtle differences between the red and blue in the dutch and french flag . 
  to be pedant ; they did n't . 
  dutch flag is #ae 1c28 #ffffff # 21468b french flag is #ef 4135 #ffffff # 0055a4 ( reversed , to maintain red white blue format ), 
   dude i did n't call you fucktard , i called wilders a fucktard . 
  are n't we in agreement about that ? 
   oh sorry , i misread that . 
  my apologies . 
  observable facts say that wilders nearly never votes pro-lgbt . 
  he 's a conservative , he does n't care about things like that . 
  how we interpret the facts is different , but the facts are that he sure as hell is n't pro-lgbt until they 're directly threatened by islamists . 
  `` lets call people fucktards because i disagree '' nice going dude . 
  if you believe wilders would stand up for our healthcare system or lgbt for any reason except to look good for his voters , you 're fooling yourself . 
  you might as well ask the trees how they feel about the sky being blue . 
  wilders does n't ** care ** about those values . 
  if his dutch base said they 'd want to revoke those values , he 'd vote for revoking them . 
  thinking he 's in any way concerned about the lgbt community unless it 's a threat by muslims is plain stupid . 
  he and his party have shown time and time again that they 'll gladly vote ** against ** lgbt-rights , and do you know why ? 
  because they do n't care !, 
  it 's not an issue to them unless they can win votes !, 
  they 're not against lgbt/abortion rights , but they sure as hell are n't pro abortion/pro-lgbt . 
  that 's how he acts , that 's how he votes , that 's how his party votes . 
  so i 'm 100 % sure lgbt-rights are complete non-issues to them . 
  that 's not `` better then republicans '' that 's `` as bad , but in a different way '' . 
  like what values ? 
  seeing the value of single-payer healthcare or allowing abortions ? 
  because i 'm 100 % sure he does n't care in the slightest about those issues unless politically motivated . 
  i try to make no illusions - the other parties might work with him , but the system will sure not stop him . 
  also , wilders is as right as the republicans . 
  he wrote some left measures in his election program , but they 're basically `` we will fix healthcare , etc. 
  '' , `` increase pensions and stuff '' , `` more money for students etc. '', 
  without concrete plans , so pure nonsense . 
  erdogan light ? 
  really ? 
  interesting . 
  [ not the first time an australian confuses the dutch and french flags either ] ( https://imgur.com/9ehvs4p ), 
  of couuuuurse someone from schleswig-holstein replies . 
  [ this is n't the first time my flag gets confused for your either ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hoi4/comments/4nompm/the_flag_of_fascist_netherlands_is_actually_the/ ), 
  what ? 
  party loyalty ? 
  voting green despite barely agreeing with them or even knowing their ideology ? 
  i think thats just the housing problem, 
  batavian republic was an inside job !, 
  it 's the sidebar image for / r/ik _ ihe , the dutch version of / r/me _ irl, 
  and us dutchies ? 
  [ did ... did a german write this ] ( https://twitter.com/ilikemints/status/643552504723148800 ), 
  not really . 
  the nsb expected to come into power once the germans invaded , but where quickly sidelined and arthur seyss-inquart was installed , and the nsb would only collaborate with the germans , without holding actual power . 
  the netherlands would 've been incorperated into germany though - there 's a vichy france but there 's not nazi netherlands , only a government-in-exile . 
  that 's ... not entirely true . 
  literally ruling the world ? 
  no , not really . 
  being an economic great power able to shape the world , with global political pressure ? 
  absolutely . 
  do n't forget that we where able to match the french in political and economic power and for a time even stronger ( glorious revolution ) than the brits . 
  i mean , america and china do n't literally rule the world either , but their influence means they can exert a lot of power . 
  wilders has had enough votes to join the coalition parties once before . 
  it did n't go well , and wilders basically proved incapable of being part of a coalition . 
   there are barely any parties that would be willing to govern with him , to clarify on why this is n't just a theory but actual practice ; wilders ' party supported the coalition from 2010 to 2012 , but the coalition could n't achieve support over the budget of 2013 and went into 7 weeks of negotiations . 
  the government fell , mostly because of wilders , and most partys vowed to keep wilders out of all coalition talks because he 's so difficult as a person ( and ideologically bankrupt ) . 
  wilders has had enough votes to join the coalition parties once before . 
  it did n't go well , and wilders basically proved incapable of being part of a coalition . 
  legally , you can eat wolves if you 'd win the vote . 
  practically , it will never happen . 
  there , constitutional democracy . 
  same rights for everyone , partially and democratically enforced .
