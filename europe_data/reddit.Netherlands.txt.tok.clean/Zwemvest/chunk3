  and nonsense . 
  you can not put your finger in a dyke to stop a leak . 
  yep , we too moved from `` apenstaartje '' ( monkey 's tail with a diminutive ) towards `` at '' . 
   `` the holy roman empire was neither holy , nor roman , nor an empire '' . 
  that 's a voltaire quote , and it applies to his day and age . 
  the hre * used to be * an empire , and claimed that the emperor held supreme power inherited from the emperors of rome and invested by god . 
  so i 'm willing to agree that the terms holy and roman may be mostly nominal ( even though the hre did contain rome at it 's foundation , and was catholic , so could be considered holy ) . 
  however , the term `` empire '' was and has been a justified term . 
  it 's just that in voltaire 's day and age , the empire had become so decentralized , and in-name-only , that it just would n't be correct to consider it an empire . 
  [ you cocky cock !,

  someone has been playing eu4 . 
  that does not correspond with the official colours , yellow for catholics and dark blue for protestants , as established by europa universalis . 
  not easy . 
  i would n't know , except for the dutch islands . 
  aruba , bonaire , and curacao are in acb order , and i know trinidad and tobago , sint maarten/martinique , and the other sss islands , and that 's about it . 
  well , your home-continent is always easy . 
  call your mates cunts , call all cunts mate . 
  i find that it helps if you know something about the countries . 
  monaco , vatican city , and san marino are city - states , states that exist as only a single city . 
  liechtenstein and andorra are not . 
  non-european city states are , for example , singapore , hong kong and macau . 
  [ here is a map . ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/european_microstates_map.svg/1280px-european_microstates_map.svg.png ) . 
  from left to right , they are andorra , monaco , liechtenstein , and then san marino above and vatican city below , in rome . 
  ** san marino ** is one of the two nations that are fully landlocked by italy . 
  the other is , of course , vatican city , in rome . 
  san marino is the oldest still existing republic , becoming independant in 301 . 
  ** liechtenstein ** sounds german , and that 's because it is . 
  it 's landlocked between switzerland and austria . 
  liechtenstein sent 80 men to fight in the austro-prussian war of 1868 . 
  81 returned , as they had made a friend . 
  liechtenstein is one of the two countries in the world ( the other is uzbekistan ) that is double-landlocked , meaning landlocked by countries that are also landlocked . 
  ** monaco ** is in south east france , bordering the mediterranean sea and near italy . 
  monaco is known for the monaco grand prix , a formula one motor race held each year on the circuit de monaco . 
  run since 1929 , it is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world . 
  the international jet set all gather here once a year to watch this race , as seen in iron man 2 . 
  it is the only microstate on this list that is n't landlocked . 
  ** vatican city ** lies in rome , central/west italy , and is , of course , where the pope settles , in the form of the holy see . 
  the title pope is higher then emperor in the feudal system , and as such , no catholic emperor may rule without consent from the pope , and the pope shall only answer to god . 
  vatican city only has ~ 900 permanent residents , so the odds you 'll see someone with vatican city flair on reddit are pretty small . 
  last microstate is ** andorra ** . 
  andorra lies in the pyrrineas between spain and france . 
  andorra is ruled as a dual - monarchy by the bishop of urgell ( spain ) and the president of france . 
  this makes the president of france a elected president and a monarch at the same time . 
  are there other cartoons ( serious question ) ? 
  and donald duck !, 
  the netherlands and denmark are the * defacto * producers of the most donald duck comics ( though walt disney is based in the us , the us tends to produce mickey mouse comics , not donald duck comics ) . 
  well , it 's basically the same situation . 
  there is no difference between the flemish and dutch language ; flemish is a dutch dialect , not a seperate language . 
  the flemish use a soft g , like the southern brabanders and limburgers in the netherlands , and prefer `` friet '' over `` patat '' , and `` plezant '' over `` leuk '' but that 's about it . 
  geert wilders is mostly hot air , though . 
  hahahah that 's hilarious . 
  i tend to be wordy . 
  [ true that . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vog4mzygvuw ), 
  paging / u/jebusgobson who can answer this question way better then i ever could . 
  there sure are cultural differences , stereotypes , and history , like how the suppression of flemish in history still does n't sit well with most flemish , and how most flemish speak walloon but not vica-versa . 
  i find it hard to say if the flemish are more similair to the dutch or to the walloons . 
  either way , they 'd feel offended . 
  that 's certainly true for our politics , which are americanizing . 
  if i try reaaaaaally hard , it seems i can understand it somewhat . 
  wait what ? 
  germany feels culturally closer then flanders ? 
  i thought we where bicycle buddies :'(, 
  hmmm , i always found huge differences between germany and the netherlands , more then denmark , for example . 
  but we 're still more similar then different , and i can imagine you feel culturally closer then the netherlands instead of austria if you 're only an hour away from our border . 
  redditor with flemish flair ? 
  probably does n't even feel related to his own country ... 
  brothers to the flemish , acquaintances to the walloons . 
  and the centre for train delays ( only utrecht though ) . 
  [ i live in train delay central - utrecht ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qyzbr8rh.jpg ), 
  why would it be ? 
  if i wanted to make a christian search engine that filters anything gay or atheist , it 'd be free to do so . 
  ( for people who do n't understand this ; [ dutch people tend to sit in circles at birthday parties ] ( http://0.static.upcoming.nl/static/images/765e2c91c8_1379517109_3938777908_f8ca0c6027_o__list-noup.jpg ) ), 
  got a sniff of your culture and cuisine while touring budapest . 
  fucking love it . 
  hungarians are so clearly european , and so unique at the same time . 
  not even hawa\u00ef , florida and alaska ? 
  i 'm thinking he did it on purpose . 
  you did , it 's just that you did n't understand them . 
  me too . 
  good old dumb belgians . 
  it is a speed limit sign . 
  damn germans digging holes and stealing bikes . 
  :( i feel sorry for you , brother . 
  german , dutch , and french assholes think they can steal any bike they like, 
  oh wow , actual french thugs . 
  that 's harsh man . 
  [ pah , stupid frenchies !, 
  we happily celebrate the royal family here once a year . 
   walks this is why we ignored you , where is your bike man ? 
  hahahah it 's located on liberty square, 
   new kids nitro and turbo ( dutch ) , also hilarious . 
  that 's a pretty unique one to like . 
  but if you liked new kids , try watching bros before hoes . 
  that too , yes . 
  yes , they should . 
  they absolutely should . 
  our government has one hand in the us ' pants to give handies , and i do n't like it one bit . 
  our national security agency was barely spied upon , because they where sharing everything with the us agencies anyways .
