   nah we just wonder why you do n't care when it 's the british , french , or any other country doing it . 
  severity . 
  the us proves to be spying time and time again , on anything from spy agencies , national leaders , corporate espionage , and civilians . 
  besides that , we 've been at war , trying to assume hegemony , playing political games with one-another , and full of distrust for our entire history . 
  we 're finally working towards more of an union , but we still distrust one-another . 
  your country has only been on the world stage for the last 200 years . 
  we expect better . 
   why there is such hatred for trade agreements with us but not for one with canada , even though their pm thinks global warming do n't real . 
  for one , because trade agreements are not about his thoughts on global warming . 
  sure , mostly trade agreements have some clauses that protect nature , but that does n't affect the personal views of the canadian pm . 
  for seconds , because us trade agreements seem to instill us-corporatism , furthered corporate interest , and us-hegemony . 
  though i accuse the us of trying to assert us neo-imperialism by constant interventionism , at least it is n't straight forward imperialism as in russia 's case . 
  putin * is * the only g20 leader that 's still empire-building through jingoism . 
  imagine merkel tried to assert that east-prussia or kalingrad should still be part of germany !, 
  the backlash would be huge !, 
  we still lack oost-friesland . 
   but waloni\u00eb can go to france tbh the * walloons * can go to france , we can still annex wallonia . 
  we ate that shit * literally *, 
  because he diverted attention away by planting a bomb in oslo , and then went to a hard-to-reach island , surrounded by open water , ensuring nobody could leave without being seen ? 
  seriously , he had all the time in the world . 
  european but without immigrants !, 
  * triggered *, 
  [ orange islands eh ? 
  can i catch pok\u00e9mon there ? 
  ] ( http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/orange_archipelago ), 
  it 's both . 
  north brabant is one of the southernmost provinces in the netherlands , south brabant one of the northernmost provinces of belgium , belgium has the west of limburg in their east , we have the north , west , and south , belgium consists of all of flanders except the dutch part ... yeah , it 's a confusing bit . 
  hey poland . 
  [ the term is batavianization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/batavianization ), 
  our army in wwii was heavily outdated . 
  [ but that does n't mean the dutch lack militairy history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coehorn ) . 
  citizens from these islands can freely move anywhere in the eu and vote for eu elections . 
  europeans can not freely move to these islands . 
   also , what part of the above diagram is technically fully part of the eu/schengen/eurozone ? 
  bonaire , sint eustatius and saba are ( becoming ) part of the eu ( as overseas territory ) , but use the us dollar as monitairy unit . 
  as such , they are not part of the eurozone . 
  aruba , cura\u00e7ao , and sint-maarten are overseas countries and territories of the eu . 
  they are not part of the eu and the eu acquis does not apply to them , though those joining octa are required to respect the detailed rules and procedures outlined by this association agreement . 
  cura\u00e7ao , and sint-maarten use netherlands antillean guilder and will switch to the caribbean guilder . 
  aruba uses the aruban florin . 
  none of them are schengen , because you need to cross non-schengen area to reach them . 
  [ not even part of the netherlands ] ( https://i.imgur.com/yitj07m.jpg ) to foreigners : * our new public traffic chip-card lets you travel all of the netherlands * * and limburg *, 
  the entire idea that germany would fight nail and tooth to prevent the nato form going to war is kinda silly . 
  `` norad detects incoming icbms '' `` us calls putin to ask if norad is right '' `` putin is lying '' `` russian first strike destroys much of the us '' yeaaah ... if the estonia is already in a limited nuclear war with russia , i doubt the us would call putin and believe him on his word . 
  the historical accusation is that britain was n't interested in a balance of power , it was that britain pursued an policy of non-involvement . 
  [ britain , specifically starting with george iii preferred to pay their allies subsidies above fighting their own wars ] ( https://i.imgur.com/gcu5mmm.jpg ) . 
  the british policy was literally throw lots of money at the second-strongest land power in europe to keep them fighting the strongest land power in europe , while the british took advantage of them being occupied to make even more money off trade and colonies . 
  this is no longer true , obviously , as the times of empire-building are long gone , and the uk is actively involved in international peacekeeping . 
  perfidious albion does not refer to a policy where the uk tried to preserve a balance of power , and is not relevant for the eu . 
  i agree , but the problem is that from an ideological point of view , such a line would be fully arbitrary . 
  how many people are required before you can request a translation ? 
  and do people with a second language count ? 
  what if they speak a near extinct language and a larger secondary language , but just want to read it in their native tongue ? 
  love it !, 
  exactly . 
  let 's go for some of those underseas oilfields , might solve our groninger problems . 
  but the difference is nearly unreadable . 
  or i 'm just colourblind . 
   just slightly bigger than denmark , netherlands time to fire up those windmills , guys !, 
  let 's anschluss some ocean !, 
  nope . 
  think 200 years later . 
  yep . 
  pretty easy , if you know your history . 
  translate it into local dialects for all i care . 
  we 're a cultural union above all else . 
  take crown , backfires . 
  companies not happy . 
  but at least the kings wife got to rule england . 
  and microstates such as liechtenstein , andorra , and san marino ? 
  i know liechtenstein had that war where they sent 80 men and returned with 81 , but i do n't know anything about andorra and san marino . 
  [ mostly because of perfidious albion ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/perfidious_albion ) . 
  besides that , we fought several anglo - dutch wars for trade hegemony , and do n't think the english would n't have invaded if they could . 
  and then there 's france . 
  do n't get me started on england and france . 
  i seriously do n't get it . 
  we pride ourselves on unionism , how we all get along despite all being different , and then people suggest we exclude the irish because they 're too small ? 
  [ yeaaaahhhhh ... about that ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_service-members%27_protection_act ), 
  we have a hard-line stance ? 
   the netherlands might if egged on by germany that sounds like we 're either on the fence or a satellite state of germany , and neither is true . 
  the dutch people do n't want a grexit , the prime minister does n't want one , the minister of finance is doing everything to prevent it , and no parties have called for a grexit yet . 
  ah , yes , the famous belgian golden age . 
  good point !, 
  i 'll imitate the flemish !, 
  so filled with air i 'll remain afloat !, 
  and it worked . 
  b-b-but where will i live, 
  hmmm , yeah , okay , the `` lazy , fat , greek on flipflops '' is really unfunny and kinda racist by now . 
  no reason to do that if you 're going to put a flag on his shirt anyways . 
  the comic itself just kinda seems like a poor way to express his own biased views about the greek crisis . 
  it 's obviously far more nuanced , but never mind , got ta make a comic . 
  and i do n't try to take it personally , it 's just a bit overplayed . 
  it 's tiring to enter a thread about the netherlands and see that the top comment is the same fucking joke/video again ... fuck walloons . 
  it would n't make much sense if we all had the european flag as flair , right ? 
  same reason we use province flags in / r/thenetherlands instead of giving everyone a flair of a dutch or non-dutch flag . 
  this joke is seriously unfunny . 
  it 's old , overused and it 's almost never in any relevant way related to the post except the post is about dutch people . 
  i do n't understand why people still up vote this , it 's as funny as `` muricans fat '' , `` french surrender mankeys '' , `` southern europe poor lazy bankrupt '', 
  zeist tried this in the '30s . 
  on even days people where kept employed by digging a hole , on uneven days people where kept employed by filling a hole .
