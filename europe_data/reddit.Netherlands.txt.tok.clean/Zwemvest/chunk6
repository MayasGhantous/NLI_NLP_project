  he fades into obscurity if there is n't any news about radicalism , and reappears the next terrorist attack . 
  his party is pretty anti-immigration on these kinds of issues , but centrist on everything else ; ergo , he does n't hold any strong opinions on anything but immigration . 
  yeah , we have pretty of problems ; our pension system will collapse in ~ 20 years , we just got rid of student grants ( they became student loans ) , we 're getting rid of some social healthcare options , softdrugs are getting more and more criminialized ... we 're de-socializing to the old american model , and i do n't like it one goddamn bit . 
  oops . 
  corrected it ... somewhat . 
   you would be surprised . 
  nowadays you can get a lot of stuff online or at least order stuff in through a local liquor store ( higher end ones anyway ) . 
  that actually does n't surprise me . 
  i know how the internet and capitalism work   most supermarkets will have a pretty solid selection of larger name imports . 
  it 's definitely lightyears ahead of what it was even 10 years ago . 
  i fucking love living in the future . 
   on the other hand , i ca n't believe someone could delude themselves to that extent . 
  i do , that 's why i believe that humans are naturally good , willing to do good , and only find evil in our hearts because we justify it . 
  i think the greatest evil we know is apathy . 
  we 're all willing to help in theorie , but we all find ways to not help in practice : `` too much effort '' , `` someone else will do it '' , `` he probably deserved it '' . 
  i think our greatest evil is our apathy , an unwillingness to take a long , hard , look in the mirror and say to ourselves : `` maybe i 'm a bully . 
  maybe i am a bad guy '' . 
  i still think he 's convinced nobody could 've done it better , or that he deserves his position . 
  i 'm 100 % convinced that he justifies all his actions before he goes to sleep , just to never be the bad guy . 
  [ i 'll send you a dutch taplist back ] ( http://beheer.debuut-bv.nl/files/beheer.debuut-bv.nl/menu/olivier/olivier-bieren-utrecht.pdf ) . 
  and wow , that 's amazing . 
  i know it 's kinda blowing up the last couple of years . 
  had a raging bitch last month , from flying dog . 
  love the american beers - belgian style so far . 
  and you 're always welcome in the netherlands , though i know the belgians are also very welcoming people . 
  come visit utrecht some time - we have 4 different ( craft ) beer festivals . 
  yeah , not only are we next door and maintaining very good relations with belgium , we 're also both huge beer drinkers . 
  and i think it 's a bit of a ny thing , yeah . 
  i do n't think the same counts for other cities or even rural situations , though california strikes me as the kind of place that has at least 20 different belgian craft beers per supermarket . 
  rocheforts are extremely good and popular . 
  most dutchies drink la trappe trappist or le chouffe, 
  seriously . 
  that shit infuriates me , no wonder americans on / r/shitamericanssay say things like `` all europeans are racist '', 
  i do n't think so . 
  i can get like , 6 or 7 different belgian beers at local pubs , and at least that many at local supermarkets . 
  specialty beer cafes are especially insane , some serving up to 200 different belgian beers . 
  of course , i am dutch , so that barely counts . 
  and i still think he sees himself as a great leader . 
  also , we basically founded that shit . 
  founding members of the weu , ecsc and eec , part of the [ inner six ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inner_six ) , and obviously part of the benelux . 
  i 'd say the chance of the netherlands leaving the eu is extremely small . 
  thank you , ireland . 
  tanks actually have right of way in the netherlands - there are three kinds of traffic that supersede the `` right of way '' traffic rules on non-priority road ( normally you 'd give right of way to vehicles coming from the right on non-priority roads , but that does n't apply here ) , and inherit all `` right of way '' rules from the first-most vehicle ( ergo , you may not interrupt them once the first vehicle has passed ) : - military convoys - funeral processions - trams, 
  i do n't even think cartoon villains exist . 
  is there genuinely anyone non-insane who thought he was doing evil for the purpose of being evil ? 
  at best , people consider themselves to do what is necessary for the greater good . 
  no , but i 'll build in a `` form belgium '' decision in europa universalis for flemish and wallonian culture for you . 
  and then a `` secede from belgium and form greater flanders '' decision for belgium . 
  clog working , actually . 
  and now the truth : software engineering . 
  i 'm specialised in video game design . 
  i 'm eagerly eying the applications at career.paradoxplaza.com, 
  you talking shit about utrecht , boy ? 
  just a lot of stress - finishing graduation, 
  i 'm just having a very rough time , man . 
  hows life !? 
  okay , let me retry ; [ novus ordo soccerum ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/novus_ordo_seclorum ) and those are ten days ' campaigning words . 
  it sounded better in my head , okay !, 
  brazil did pretty mediocre , and closed with an embarrassing defeat . 
  we did pretty good and always close with a narrow defeat ( germany , argentina , spain , again argentina in 2014 ) . 
  i like brazil better , at least they did n't get my hopes up ... 
  well , it 's not annoying per se . 
  it seems everybody immediatly knows what i ment , just by only repeating what he said . 
  sadly , yes . 
  like your back-to-back world champions title or your 60 million super bowl titles ? 
  there are a couple of interesting countries outside the uefa , and japan is certainly one of them . 
  illumififa, 
  * holland *, 
  and technically it 's not as much man-made as sea-deprived . 
  carl barks will always be the father of donald duck . 
  have you even seen the code at the beginning of a donald duck comic ? 
  if the code starts with a h , it 's dutch ( for holland ) , if it 's an d , it 's written in denmark , wdc means walt disney comics , us stories for international markets use an s , the prefix i means italy , and the e means european ( but mostly french ) . 
  and belgianization is also another word for [ batavianization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/batavianization ) or vernederlandsing , as an active part of the flemish movement . 
  but that 's kinda because belgica used to be a synonym for the low countries before belgium came into existence in 1815-1830 , and not because dutch and belgian cultural identities are equal ... 
   these people are permanently marked by their own inability to shape their own destiny . 
  but you 're not going to do anything about it , right ? 
  the european capital is already in belgium , so ... 
  yes , that , i love that on my frieten . 
  is frietsaus the one with mustard or without mustard ? 
  i 'd say you could assimilate them , but that does n't work . 
  german cultural assimilation is called [ germanification ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/germanification ) , french cultural assimilation is called [ francization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francization ) , but [ flanderization ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/flanderization ) means to exaggerate character traits in sitcoms . 
  yup . 
  some countries might mix the mayo with mustard though . 
  i prefer mine without . 
  you gon na pull that 1795 shit again ? 
  well it is n't as if anyone ever posts in our unification subreddit , now is it ? 
   prussia never occupied us though ... 
  remove brandenburger . 
  [ stop the unlawfull occupation of geldern !, 
  louis of bonaparte was n't as bad though . 
  he was pretty popular in the netherlands . 
   ( edit : and i almost forgot to mention the dutch . ), 
  if it aint dutch it aint much, 
  do you only know that because it was offline last week ? 
  ^ ( i did ), 
  so many philosophers where hypocrites that i no longer think that `` do as i say , not as i do ( did ) '' is a bad thing . 
  literally , the sea is gaining ground . 
  okay , i get what you 're saying . 
  if he could proclaim a new islamic post-ottoman caliphate , he would . 
  i suddenly learned how to play keytar .
