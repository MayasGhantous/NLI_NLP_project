   comes to religion than vast majority of republican politicians in us . 
  are you absolutely sure ? 
  in my opinion , religion is a major backing point for the republic party on stances such as abortion or freedom of religion , and it even feels like they sometimes try to turn america into a christian country . 
  i have the sources to back that , but i also think i 'm pretty much in a bubble , and not all republicans are like that . 
  * cancer * !, 
  so the flemish will be in . 
  and kalingsgrad back to germany !, 
  that 's why i 'm a huge proponent of / r/groot _ vlaanderen . 
  united , with all the adventages of the dutch and flemish . 
  dutch government , flemish brussels , flemish fries at the dutch febo , dutch roads , flemish taxes , and the dutch-flemish combined harbor of super antwerotterdam, 
  okay , better one : `` only criminals download '', 
  yeah , okay , but he 's still a soggy kroket . 
  `` only criminals use torrents '' . 
  ah , with our benevolent dicktator tim `` fuck your privacy , money is what matters '' kuik . 
  well , yeah , the chance of zwolle ever reuniting with the netherlands is a lot bigger then flanders reuniting with the netherlands . 
  tried the engelse drop ( english liquorice ) ? 
  the english are possible the only people who can properly appreciate our liquorice . 
  yep . 
  the salty things . 
  foreigners tend to gravely dislike it , dutch people love it . 
  look up youtube videos of foreigners trying it and you 'll see them literally gagging . 
  that 's why you 're dutch . 
  yes , sadly they do n't sell all dutch national dishes , such as the delicious stroopwafel or the `` only a dutchie can eat this '' - black liquorice, 
  want dutch national dishes ? 
  get them at the febo . 
  you sure ? 
  i can do that too !, 
  it did not eat our babies . 
  [ we actually had a wolf running through one of our villages ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2993291/wolf-door-wild-animal-spotted-wandering-residential-street-dutch-town.html ) sorry for using the dailymail as a source .

  `` diplomatic insult '' , come on .

  yet still , the article has somewhat of a point ; can you really be considered a `` non-neet '' if you do n't hold a serious job , just a job to finance your gaming hobby or marijuana use because your parent wo n't do it ? 
  [ he 's probably talking about this recent nrc article about hidden youth unemployment ] ( http://www.nrc.nl/opinie/2015/03/27/verborgen-werkloosheid-die-kruimelbaantjes-van-jongeren/ ), 
   if you 're born in the netherlands you 're a hollander as an utrechter ... fuck you , jebus . 
   if you are really that proud of your frisian heritage !, 
  time for some new holland-frisian wars !, 
  oh no you really went all-out here , did n't you ? 
  yes , we 're both from / r/groot _ vlaanderen, 
  it is not just you who is mad . 
  im mad too . 
  why is this woman so incompetent o my god what are you doing with that fucking knife thats not how you open beer that shit is dangerous why would you think its a twistoff oh no what are you doing thats not how you pour beer ... are you waiting for it to stale ? 
  its fucking dead no of course it tastes disgusting you stupid subhuman, 
  and still , you 're 4 times cheaper then a us developer . 
  22.000 dollar would be extremely cheap for a dutch softwaredeveloper . 
  [ and at the same time , a blog post from stackoverflow said ukrainian software developers have the highest purchasing power . 
  ] ( http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-geo ) if you want to buy big macs , of course . 
  they : `` every football coach ever '' country of 16 million football coaches ; when we lose , everybody knows what the team * should * have done . 
   of course he was wallonian , hence why he was stealing things ( sayings , in this case ) from the flemish . 
  you make a good point there . 
  i rest my case . 
   i get the feeling you did n't grasp the subtle undercurrent of critique on the belgian state austin powers was rife with . 
  stupid flemish propaganda movie . 
  not all dutch are obsessed with gold and genitals . 
  i think i have a aunt who 's more into silver . 
  remember that he was * wallonian * , because he does n't speak freaky-deaky dutch ( despite being from bruges ) . 
  oh hah-hah it 's an austin powers reference . 
  if you keep doing this we 'll never form groot vlaanderen with you guys . 
  the party 's are no longer based on policy , so i do n't understand why they - 'd splinter . 
  and you do n't have to vote . 
  but , as i said , that just brings new problems . 
  dutch republic best republic . 
  featuring bruce willis as the latin emperor !, 
  time for a second glorious revolution !, 
  great britain belongs to the dutch !, 
  well , i 'd want to make it interesting for people to vote and decide on an issue , so i 'd rather see `` representative votes '' gone . 
  either you 're interested on a subject and you vote , or you 're not and you do n't vote . 
  but that would slowly degrade into a situation where a small minority of interested people decide on policies for the uninterested majority , and i do n't think that 's a good thing . 
  internet democracy .

  and the lack of southern lombardy, 
  but wait , got ta finish this war, 
  a game where you 're still a noob with 200 hours logged ... 
  hup holland hup !, 
  yes . 
  let 's keep it at `` somewhat '', 
  like i need to worry about that ; belgians traditions : * permanent regency *, 
  i 'm not sure your government would survive an annexation of the netherlands . 
  you need a strong government , and while i love your beers and fries , governments seem to be somewhat of a problem . 
  may i suggest an absolute flemish monarchy under willem-alexander ? 
  so , no unification for now ? 
  [ ca n't we unite ? 
  we get your great fries and beer , and you get a government that actually functions ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/groot_vlaanderen ), 
  he 's flemish , he does n't understand your comment unless you use simple words . 
  reforming the polish-lithuanian commonwealth ? 
  i hope you mean the oblasts of nizhny novgorod , tver , perm , smolensk , ryazan , pskov , or polotsk . 
  novogorod are filthy kapitalists . 
  walloon can not into benelux !, 
  i one tagged twice , once as minghals and once with the timurids . 
  ottomans are easiest to one-tag with , france is still limited in the early game by the hre and surrounded by nations that can beat france ( until it gets elan ) . 
  i like forming germany with prussia over uniting the hre , but you 're still correct that the challenge of brandenburg slowly decreases . 
  diplomacy in the early game , military in the midgame , and if you played your cards right , you 're done in the lategame . 
  mostly brandenburg , dutch minors , or hordes . 
  i like rotw as well . 
  i dislike huge nations like france or the ottomans . 
  no challenge .
