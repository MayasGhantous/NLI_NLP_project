  osman cannonballs ca n't melt theodosian walls !, 
  i dunno man , i play a lot of eu4 . 
  stay the fuck away from our bikes . 
  you 've already stole them once , not again . 
  though this video leaves a lot of history of poland unexplained , it 's very well done if you know it . 
  meritocracy has some severe disadvantages : issues are nearly never 1 ) without relationship to other issues ( so you 'd need a multidisciplinary merit for any post ) 2 ) black and white ( so you must always understand they want to take the `` best '' decision ) , finally , merit based appointed experts favor the merit they were appointed for ( an expert on infrastructure can always justify extra budget for infrastructure , for example ) . 
  yeah , fuck those germans stealing our beaches every year . 
  dat is zo . 
  nobody understands swedish except ikea employees , so that 's hardly an argument . 
   and burned down by a gullible american tourist who had been convinced by his swedish hosts that doing so was perfectly legal . 
  he served ten days in prison . 
  oh my god i ca n't stop laughing and yet i feel so bad for him . 
  had to be either an american or a dane . 
  you started in the middle of the paper !, 
  thats where utrecht should have been, 
  believe me that though everybody complains , the rotterdammers are actually kinda proud of this thing . 
  they 're humorous people . 
  and i thought we had problems with germans annexing our beaches . 
  while we see rotterdam , the hague , utrecht , and amsterdam as 4 or 3 distinct districts , it 's basically one big metropolitan `` randstad '' - area, 
  we think we 're not influenced by propaganda , because we 're first world countries . 
  bad news ; we are . 
  propaganda is more real then ever . 
  most countries are wonderful , it 's politicians that are stupid . 
  turkey is no exception . 
  the system is wrong , and the mayor happily exploits it . 
  nowhere from / u/fsmftw1 s comment did i get that he supports it . 
  the utrechtian independance movement consists of only me , but only because i 'm a huge fan of the infrastructural chaos the independance of utrecht would cause . 
  you think the ns is bad now ? 
  we had colonies in oceania , though . 
  i counted australia as part of oceania . 
  we had colonies on every continent ... 
  nederlandland, 
  thanks for the credit !, 
  the people ride bikes , the land is below sea level , and we 're all tall . 
  why do the flemish exist anyways ? 
  i 'm upset about being included in the german culture group in eu4 :( ... ck2 , fine , but eu4 ? 
  why is dutch athens called athen instead of athene ? 
  whoah , man , sinterklaas is still a fat month away . 
  do n't forget the former territories !, 
  annexation of india is a go !, 
  and of course , the unlawful annexation of eastern europe is fine !, 
  that was n't my point . 
  my point was that / u/fuckthisuser said that 60 % of the population is russian , and / u/andy18cruz argued that it 's actually 80 % if you consider everyone who speaks russian of russian ethnicity . 
  but language has nothing to do with ethnicity , not even first language . 
  a lot of nations have tried to genocide a culture by enforcing their language as the only legal language , that does n't magically change your ethnicity . 
  99 % of the netherlands speaks english , but england has absolutely no claim on the netherlands . 
  percentage of speakers of a language means absolutely nothing without ethnicity . 
  i 've studied philosophy for a while : / there is literally currently no way to prevent tyranny in a government . 
  in case of a democracy it 's tyranny of the majority . 
  the problem with democracy is that most people are easily convinced idiots . 
  with difficulty , they can understand each other . 
  or flemish . 
  yes , all dutch kids are required to read * kritik der reinen vernunft * before high school . 
  [ no , that 's this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shpmjjp7v_s ), 
  [ well done ] ( http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/10/14/pat.gif ), 
  [ are you serious or trolling ? 
  i never know with you . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flip-flop_ ( politics \\ ) ), 
  i think that 's it . 
  either they are intelligent , but not wise , blindly believing books like atlas shrugged , or they have something to gain from their systems and are pragmatics , not idealists . 
  it 's so extreme that some expats complain that it 's hard to learn dutch in the netherlands ; even in grocery stores , as soon as somebody notices that you struggle to speak dutch , they 'll switch to english . 
  also , english and dutch share a strong bond . 
  the man is n't stupid , but he is n't wise either . 
  i really do n't get the man . 
  [ which is sad , because this picture is what i think of hillary ] ( http://offclouds.com/data_images/wallpapers/24/337191-flip-flop.jpg ), 
  the world could use some idealist leaders instead of pragmatic leaders . 
  exactly , both endorse strong liberal social policy . 
  it 's just that ron paul chooses the classic `` classical liberalism '' - small government `` do-what-you-want-the-government-shouldn ` t-regulate '' - stance , and bernie sanders endorses the socialist stance of strong social security . 
  both ron paul and bernie sanders are in favor for legalisation of marijuana because it 's a crime of morality , and the government * should n't * prohibit it . 
  `` right '' and `` left '' are n't as `` black '' and `` white '' as everyone makes them out to be . 
  wtf man, 
  sorry , yes , american english . 
  gunter from friends is an american man acting like a dutchman speaking english with an accent . 
  goldmember is joking pseudo - language , made to imitate a freaky accent . 
  i too have seen eurotrip, 
  goldmember jokes are just jokes that would have worked for any nationality though . 
  his accent is n't really dutch . 
  hahahaha i know right !, 
  see you at the union of utrecht ( a secession of utrecht would be hilarious . 
  no more public transport ! ), 
  [ i 'd love to ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/groot_vlaanderen ), 
  yeah , but fuck hollanders . 
  utrecht is where it 's at . 
  * we * have a silly accent ?!? 
  have you ever * listened * to yourself ? 
  yes netherlands influentual ja ? 
  ja of die fucking belgen . 
  exactly , it 's kinda less recognizable now then back then , but still , i recognize them . 
  [ every possible nordic cross ] ( http://imgur.com/a/airyc#0 ) . 
  you know , for when you lack imagination and ms paint . 
   in france , all regions apparently have flags nobody knows yeah , no buddy . 
  i played crusader kings/europa universalis , i recognize almost all of the mainland-french ones ... 
  they are n't bad , just barbarians . 
  come and see the violence inherent in the system !, 
  help , help , i 'm being repressed !, 
  i will start the dutch slapfight . 
  * / u/jebusgobson convinced me that not all belgians are bad, 
  edrogan is n't satan , but neither was hitler . 
  yeah , where 'd he get that idea ? 
  besides , saying that trickle down economics are related to being the country with the highest gdp for decades is like saying that slavery was good for profit : profit was never the issue .
