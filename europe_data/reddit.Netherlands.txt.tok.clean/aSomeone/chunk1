it 's indeed a stupid thing to get a referendum over . 
  especially in the ukraine situation . 
  they want a referendum fine , i think most people will vote for anyway . 
  the guys signing this are mostly the 18 year old geenstijl readers who do n't know shit and the older wackos . 
  i had one `` friend '' ( 31 years old ! ), 
  ask me to sign it . 
  when i said why i would n't he told me i should read up on the nwo , the coudenhove-kalergi plan and the rothschilds plan to take over the world . 
  somehow this was tied in with this referendum in order to keep being friends with russia '' cause they are n't all that bad '' . 
  i do n't know what to say to that honestly and the conversation ended there , probably forever . 
  is n't frisian it 's own language though and not a dialect ? 
  limburgs is a dialect and one i can hardly understand . 
  flemish is a lot more comprehensible to me a lot less weird words in between , or at least how they talk in antwerp . 
  this coming from someone in zuid-holland . 
  they 'd still need to buy the car first . 
  also i haven really seen a lot of parking lots in greece with normal electric chargers . 
  you 'd have to have those as well to make electric cars work . 
  i have n't been there since last summer and did find some sources now saying that more electric charger stations are planned . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.eltis.org/discover/news/ev-charging-stations-planned-athens-and-kozani-greece ), 
  supercharger stations are not the only things where you can plug it in . 
  people buying one should have normal charging stations at home/work that are also used for other electric cars . 
  these are just for when you 're on the road and really run out . 
  well , you 'd have a normal charging station at home and at work usually . 
  at least here in the netherlands most places have electric charger stations . 
  these superchargers are for when you are on the road and need to recharge , so it wouldnt be for the whole '' go to work and go home '' trips . 
  max range of a model s is 390km , if you go from home and drive 390km . 
  assuming you 're taking a long trip , taking a break once in a while doesnt seem that bad . 
  look up how efficient the superchargers are , you wo n't have to wait for hours . 
  at least that what 's their website tells you . 
  30 minutes is 270 km of range and at 40 mins its already at 80 % . 
  however if you want it at 100 % you 'll have to wait 75 mins for reasons explained .

  it 's still pretty long yes , but not that long . 
  indeed its been like this for a long time . 
  i have been on the ferry from ancona to patras ( and back ) quite a few times and you could hear them parking your car in there . 
  i would describe people from noord-brabant as pronouncing the g different but otherwise perfectly understandable ( most of the time ) . 
  limburgers also pronounce the g different but usually throw in many words that are not understandable ( when talking to each other of course ) . 
  no . . we have a province called limburg as well . 
  frisian is just a different language . 
  besides that , i understand flemish a lot better than limburgs . 
  limburgs is not to be understood if you live in an area with next to no dialect . 
  to be fair , when i search in google '' why is the netherlands . . '' i also get '' why is the netherlands a tax paradise '' . 
  have you seen for example the german carnaval floats ? 
  i imagine not , well they make fun of pretty much every leader of any country , [ including their own ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tap2caz.jpg ) . 
  does anyone of them try to sue them ? 
  stop being a dumb ass , erdogan should stop being such a whiny bitch . 
  yes , i was talking about the last exam you have in highschool . 
  you have spelling and grammar stuff all during highschool , but the final exam does n't focus on it . 
  it is mandatory for everyone . 
  spelling and grammar has n't been in the exam for years . 
  i did my vwo exam in 2010 and it was all reading comprehension multiple choice and a summary of a text . 
  however the summary you make is graded on spelling as well . 
  is that all that strange ? 
  i find spelling and grammar a lot less important than actually understanding a text well . 
  you do n't know about [ these ] ( http://www.lightinthebox.com/nl/ultra-heldere-waterdichte-siliconen-geleid-fiets-licht-fietsen-veiligheidswaarschuwing-licht-set-2-leds-voor-achter-rood-wit_p3281432.html?currency=eur&amp;litb_from=paid_adwords_shopping&amp;sku=429_6916&amp;utm_source=google_shopping&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;adword_mt=&amp;adword_ct=87561882434&amp;adword_kw=&amp;adword_pos=1o3&amp;adword_pl=&amp;adword_net=g&amp;adword_tar=&amp;adw_src_id=1810908567_301588514_21687237914_aud-83346267755:pla-80809630575&amp;gclid=cpg2jrlckcwcfsco0wodxjioog ) ? 
  wrap around handle bars and back of bike and you 're set . 
  the police have stated that [ no lights is n't a priority anymore ] ( http://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/veel-minder-boetes-voor-fietsers-zonder-licht~a4243030/ ) . 
  but it is different in the randstad yes . 
  in rotterdam cops wo n't look twice if you do n't have lights . 
  i used to live in a smaller city ( still in zuid-holland ) and i have been fined once and warned at least a couple of times . 
  that 's fine and all . 
  but then coming in on a topic about his death and showing you have no interest in football to act cool or whatever is really really douchy . 
  but the latin and ( old ) greek is just written form . 
  and trust me old greek is nothing like the greek language now . 
  i ended with a 4 for ancient greek while i can actually speak and read modern greek . 
  but does n't holland come from '' holtland '' meaning '' woodland '' ? 
  that would suggest there were plenty forrests . 
  yea sorry , i should have just said english . 
  the whole x = h is weird though and it bugs me a lot . 
  i 'm part greek but did n't grow up there . 
  i do speak it though . 
  this x = h made everyone have a terrible english pronunciation . 
  x in greek is in no way similar to the h sound in other languages . 
  i get that the problem is that there is no comparable letter for the greek x in english and that there is no comparable letter in greek for the english h , but still . 
  it 's so ridiculous . 
  i 'm part greek not living in greece . 
  i can speak and read it but writing is so difficult . 
  also ` ai ' or just ` e ' ? 
  \u03a6 or \u03cd , damned if i know, 
  you can get it tested at nr of locations in the netherlands . 
  you ca n't have ziggo with 120mbit and tv for 55 euro ? 
  it includes the ziggo sport now which is nice and horizon tv ( watching tv online and do the whole pause live/fast forward/rewind etc ), 
  i do n't know if it is that way for every city hall , but my id has my actual height and they measured it on the spot . 
  just the first two times though . 
  once when i was 13 ( 183 ) and once when i was 18 ( 190 ) as i stopped growing by then . 
  ok , well i still really doubt the 90 % . 
  someone like you , who is on reddit , is probably prone to be better at english than people who are not . 
  there 's plenty of people who just visit facebook and that 's all they do on the internet , no games no anything . 
  i 've worked in a restaurant for 7 years , i honestly doubt 50 % of the people that have worked there could follow a movie without subs . 
  i had to write a letter in english for some guy to hand in , a girl texting me how to translate stuff in english during an english test etc. 
  i 'm not doubting the percentage is high , but that 90 % of the people are capable of holding a conversation in english just seems way to much . 
  well if they suck at speaking but do undertand it , i would say they do n't really know the language . 
  i 'm dutch and my friends are all pretty highly educated ( most doing their masters now ) , speak decent english and still they prefer seeing movies with subtitles . 
  however i know plenty of people with lower education and i doubt they could even follow an entire movie without them . 
  i just think the bar set for '' knowledge of foreign language '' is n't set that high . 
  of course this is all from personal experience . 
  but if i might add , the german bar is hitting almost 80 % . 
  i 've been to germany plenty of times and again i 'm very skeptical of that number being true ( assuming the one other language is usually english ) . 
  many do , but a word here and there does not constitute being able to really speak english . 
  a lot of people do speak english , but i 'm just doubting the 90 % . 
  they can read some english text maybe , but often they would n't be able to hold a conversation in english that goes longer than 2 sentences .
