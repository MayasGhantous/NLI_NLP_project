  us debt is different because the dollar is more than just their coin , a lot of countries use warehouses full of them to guarantee the value of their coin . 
  international trade is calculated in dollars . 
  that 's why a lot of countries are still lending money to the us . 
  well , i ca n't really clame the oliebol is the soul original donut . 
  ofcourse , america is a melting pot of a lot of different cultures , and other snacks can claim an influence too, 
  for the americans here : this race is called ` oliebollenrace ' . 
  oliebollen are the traditional dutch wintertime snacks . 
  when we colonized new amsterdam ( nyc ) we brought it with us . 
  it merged into your sweeter and greasier donuts . 
  you do n't really have to go through border patrol to get into the vatican though , right ? 
  do n't forget liechtenstein, 
  [ / r/travel ] ( / r/travel ) link for the lazy, 
  that is n't government , that is policy . 
  to add insult , wilders ' freedom party wants to take steps to readopt the dutch speaking part of belgium . 
  like it just is n't completely ridiculous to put that in your party program . 
  btw , de telegraaf is about the worse and most sensational newspaper we 've got . 
  this all sounds like a perfect plan to not see any thing in 6 days but your preconceived ideas proven, 
  thia is all extremely unrealistic . 
  you are forgetting there are 6 billion of us . 
  [ read this book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/triumph-city-greatest-invention-healthier/dp/159420277x ), 
  you 're forgetting how loarge a part of the food we eat is progressed . 
  it 's not farm  settlement , it is x number of farms  processing  settlement . 
  having x number of settlements instead of 1 settlement is less efficient . 
  the likelyhood that you go biking down to a farm is minute . 
  the chances of biking to your local supermarket however , is a lot larger when that supermarket is only a few blocks away . 
  if you live in a large city , you do n't really have to own a car , you do need a car if you do n't . 
  making large investments is just easier if you are big . 
  where i live there is a lot of food/flowers are produced in greenhouses . 
  the scale of those greenhouses has exploded in the past few decades . 
  this has enabled them to invest in things like co2 pipe lines from industrial sites ( plants love that co2 ) and most have switched to , uhm , `` impregnate '' their plants using bees . 
  the downside of this is also covered in * food inc. * movie . 
  that is , that farmers have to keep borrowing money from the bank to make these investments the buyers of their products want . 
  that being large food processing firms . 
  making them slaves of those contracts . 
  figures on what exactly ? 
  having a small patch with vegies in your back garden severely limits the transportation costs , but it is n't really managable to most city fokes . 
  larger cities make for more efficient transportation of food ( recently on the daily show they had an interview ) . 
  only if it detects you are from the eu, 
  the climate is changing faster than what plants have seen before .
