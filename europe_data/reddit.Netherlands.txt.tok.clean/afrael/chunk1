actually , strijp s is awesome :d . 
  well i meant ww3 as alternative to unity , not to austerity , 
  wo n't that increase the amount of `` we 're walking '' threats rather than decrease them ? 
  those threats are annoying and have a terrible effect on the discussion . 
  same for the netherlands . 
  no , those are just in / r/britishproblems :p . 
  are you begging for gold now ? 
  hehe yeah i do n't game at all , so i guess my situation is a bit different . 
  i only care about books and dvd 's , and i both download and buy a lot of those . 
  i suppose for games and music both it makes more sense to just buy digital . 
  i just like to collect , to have a case full of books and dvd 's and such to browse or to lend to friends is something i enjoy . 
  plus , physical dvd 's and books are often cheaper than digital . 
  i do n't really need lots of new music though , so i guess if you like to listen to the latest stuff there 's a good reason to buy digital . 
  that just does n't apply to me  . 
  then maybe i misunderstood the question , i do n't know ? 
  `` do you purchase digital media legally ? '', 
   i think this is kind of a weird question , for instance i hardly ever buy digital media but i buy lots of physical media . 
  i think you 're getting a skewed view of the piracy issue by just asking those 2 questions . 
  it 's like ` spay-ahg ' with the hard g. . . 
  sort of like ` spinach ' with a hard g but much uglier . 
  yeah , not sure what my brain is up to throwing that kind of pronounciations into the sentence ... 
  * speech sorry for nitpicking , my german friend , it just sounds really weird in my head when you write ` speach ' . 
  to be fair , the ulster bank note looks like monopoly money . 
  interesting though , thanks for the explanation :p . 
  the rest of the country is set to follow in 2013 though . 
  i do think the idea of trying to limit drug tourism is good but the execution is fucking awful . 
  i 'm sure there are better ways , let 's hope they 'll find one before then . 
  yes please . 
  hey , at least they put it on an island :p, 
  i think we dutch have a nice tradition of theatrical comedy and music , where either singers have a theatrical tour in which they also talk and such , like [ acda & de munnik ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13vq-vac6aa ) , or there 's comedy/theatre acts also gain celebrity through their songs , for instance [ youp van ' t hek ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwppegrgrls ) or [ veldhuis & kemper ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqxk0xkotvi ) . 
  this thing goes way back , for instance a lot of people knew the songs of [ wim sonneveld ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhdq59lhorq&amp; ) , who also gave shows that were basically standup comedy . 
  i think we have a pretty special tradition in that respect , even though i might not always like the music . 
  afaik it 's the same over here , i read something in the newspaper about it . 
  yes  . 
  i used to be the only one in my city , but now there 's at least 2 more !, 
  i 'm curious what kind of people they are  . 
  ok , so i got an email back from lqdn  . 
  apparently right now there 's a committee looking at acta , that will make a report before the parlement is going to actually vote on it . 
  they gave me [ this link ] ( https://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/how_to_act_against_acta ) which i did n't find before , it has some tips on the page . 
  lqdn recommends calling but does think physical letters could help . 
  their tips : `` when sending mail , you should make it personal , and send it to one person at once . 
  when making calls , remember to stay calm and polite , and that you are not an expert and do n't have to know everything and have an answer to everything . 
  you are entitled to say you will get back to them on a specific issue for instance . '', 
  about what kind of arguments to use , he of course told me to look at their interpretation but also mentioned that `` by creating criminal sanctions , acta robs meps of their exclusive capacity to do so . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , criminal law should only ever be created by parliaments , not treaties . '', 
  that 's definitely worrying . 
  also , the person from lqdn told me that `` in the weeks before the vote about acta at the european parliament , we will be launching a massive campaign to get as many people as possible to urge the meps to reject it . '', 
  so right now it 's just writing/calling to that committee and in a while lqdn will try to make some noise about the actual vote , to get people to ask their meps to vote against it . 
  ah , i hate phone calls . 
  i just sent lqdn an email as well , if letters help or not . 
  thanks for the list , i do n't see any street adress to go with the room number though . 
  in my email to lqdn i did n't ask for a form letter per se , but more in general what kind of information to include . 
  if they say anything useful i 'll let you/reddit know . 
  i 've thought about sending letters before , but i just feel overwhelmed in the face of thinking what to write ( what information would make them consider the issue more thoroughly ? ), 
  and even something as simple as who to write to and finding the address . 
  do you know of a guide for something like this ? 
  i mean , i would definitely write some letters if i did n't feel like it was pointless without knowing a lot about politics ( which i do n't , this stuff is the only issue i care enough about to get off my ass and do something , even if it 's only letters ) . 
  edit : ok , i just sent lqdn a message about this . 
  will post information on reddit if they think it 's worthwhile it to write letters and have more information about what to write and who to write to . 
  i can only speak for the netherlands  . 
  good luck on your trip !, 
  check out [ naturalis in leiden ] ( http://www.naturalis.nl/en/ ) . 
  this a super cool natural science museum . 
  they have this exhibit room that has a installation covering half the ceiling and if you put in an animal or something in a computer , its evolutionary tree lights up ( with the links/forks in its evolution as circles and the time as height from the floor ) . 
  it 's just the coolest thing :d . some of the exhibits are more for kids , but there 's plenty to do for adults . 
  of course there 's [ nemo ] ( http://www.e-nemo.nl/en/?id=1 ) in amsterdam , but that 's mostly for kids iirc , it 's a hands-on science museum . 
  you 'll probably see a lot about this museum in brochures , it 's one of the larger museums in a'dam . 
  go take a [ tour of the rotterdam harbor ] ( http://spido.nl/trips/tours/rotterdam-harbour-tour?id=1089#p696 ) if you like ships and big machinery . 
  in haarlem you 'll find [ the oldest museum of the netherlands ] ( http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/index.php?item=1&amp;lang=en ) . 
  in this museum you can sort of see how stuff was presented in the 18th and 19th century , mostly natural science and art . 
  it 's very interesting and the museum is gorgeous . 
  the main room was just restored too !, 
  hope this helps !, 
  edit : all these cities are not too far from amsterdam by train . 
  you can check travel times and train ticket prices at [ the national railway site ] ( http://www.ns.nl/en/travellers/home ) . 
  wow , that sucks . 
  i can definitely see how possible legal and health complications would make you feel hesitant to go to the us . 
  actually on entry to the us i did something wrong with the form , but the passport control guy just sort of flirted with me and let me fill out a new form and step back in at the front of the line when i was done . 
  not everything is as harsh as it seems  . 
  the us is pretty cool , but pretty strange as well . 
  i found it very wasteful in products and sense of space . 
  everything * is * bigger in the us ( and you do n't even have to go to texas ) . 
  just the scale of it is staggering . 
  i was there around the election when obama was running , it was pretty strange , as i 'm not used to campaigns being so much about a person instead of about a party . 
  mostly it was very laid back and friendly though  . 
  i definitely enjoyed my time there . 
  considering you keep sending me your posts on msn , i do n't see what 's the secret ... 
  so / r/europe is your personal facebook now ? 
  just a tip : [ wolfram alpha ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=british%20pounds%20vs%20euros&amp;lk=2 ) has much better graphs , including min/max and 10 year graphs , which yahoo does n't have  . 
  hehe , over here it 's mostly french/belgian . 
  interesting , i do n't think i know many italian comics , feel free to post your favorites !, 
  it 's a question of diagnosis too , surely . 
  a hundred years ago people who would now be classified mentally ill were just ` eccentric ' or ` completely insane ' with no middle ground . 
  right now you can be a fairly functioning member of society while also being diagnosed with a mental illness . 
  sodom . 
  i assume everyone in 2x is a girl , does that help ? 
  like i said , it does n't matter  . 
  i 'm not offended , i just find it weird . 
  just like you 'd find it weird if i 'd say ` you go girl ! ', 
  or something like that .
