  both chrome os , and android are not products sold seperately for a fee . 
  there is no cost associated with upgrading crome os or android on the same device . 
  also , both chome os ( trough chromium ) and android ( trough aosp ) are freely usable . 
  in addition , android is considered to be build by the manufacturer of the device , using a framework provided by google . 
  hell , you can have android versions without any google services working on it . 
  the difference with apple is that osx is not a generic operating system like windows and linux , but an operating system from the same company as who sold the device itself , and does only work on said devices ( without going into the hackintosh area . ) . 
  regarding chrome os , it 's a free os , so there is no additional `` tax '' .

  for the same reason we did n't go all out against countries that still had slavery or apartheid .

  pegi for video games , kijkwijzer for movies etc. 
  kijkwijzer consists of an age recommendation based on the harmful content of a product , and an explanation of this rating age recommendation : - [ al = not harmful / all ages ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/al_tag.png ) - [ 6 = watch out with children under 6 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/6_tag.png ) - [ 9 = watch out with children under 9 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/9_tag.png ) - [ 12 = watch out with children under 12 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/12_tag.png ) - [ 16 = watch out with children under 16 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/16_tag.png ) content explanation : - [ violence ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/violence.png ) - [ fear ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/fear.png ) - [ sex ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/sex.png ) - [ discrimination ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/discrimination.png ) - [ drugs and alcohol abuse ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/drugs_and_alcoholabuse.png ) - [ coarse language ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/coarse_language.png ) [ more info ] ( http://www.kijkwijzer.nl/index.php?id=75 )  kijkwijzer does not advise on suitability - the kijkwijzer age recommendation does not simply mean that a television programme or film is suitable for children of that age and above . 
  kijkwijzer makes no pronouncements on this . 
  an example : a serious documentary bears the recommendation all ages , because it contains no images that could be harmful to children . 
  the film may nevertheless be unsuitable for young children , for example because the content is too complex .
