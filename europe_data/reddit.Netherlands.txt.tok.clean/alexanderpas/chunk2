  in the netherlands any cash pament above $ 25.000 , -- has to be notified to the authorities . 
  ( this includes deposits ) they prefer non-cash as this means they do n't have to do that . 
  in the netherlands , you can accept just the form of payment you want and/or deny any other , as long as you have communicated it beforehand . 
  ( [ a sticker ] ( http://imgur.com/09zwi ) at the door and the cash register is enough . ), 
  in absence of those communications , you can pay with currency . 
  they can always deny money if they think it 's fake ( sometimes used as a fake excuse ) , but you can insist they call the police ( as they are required ) . 
  usually this makes them accept the money anyways because they do n't want to deal with the hassle ( besides the obvious cases ) . 
   to be fully reimbursed if you see a specialist you have to first consult another doctor ( typically a gp , although it can be another specialist or even the same specialist on a previous visit ) and be `` referred '' to the specialist .

  luckily we have the dutch national police internal investigation department ( rijksrecherche ) , which basically has just 2 tasks : 1 . 
  investigating official corruption . 
  investigating incidents where people got heavily injured or people die , and with the police being one of the parties involved . 
  at the moment , the rijksrecherche is actively calling for witnesses to make themselves known directly to them . 
  - ( slightly outdated ) background on the rijksrecherche in english : http://www.iaaca.org/anticorruptionauthorities/bycountriesandregions/n/netherlandsjigou/201202/t20120210_802453.shtml - structure of the dutch public prosecution service : https://www.om.nl/algemeen/english/about-the-public/organisation-the/,

  except that the union is democratically elected too , and they only get elected by the people they are bargaining for .
