  even when one does not agree with the statements made , one can still be willing to die for the right to be able to make those statements . 
  neither . 
  i 'm saying that isis terrorists does not equate muslims . 
  neither do muslims . 
  sure , a extremist group withing isis does , but those are not representative of muslims , just like the kkk is not representative of christians . 
  exactly my point . 
  just a regular old watch designed by an horologist . 
   no , the number of homes sold per month has been increasing quite briskly in the last two years . 
  and they are still below 2008 levels . 
  2013 was around half of the 2007 levels the best quarter of 2014 was around the same levels as the worst month of 2006 ,, 
  the reason it was n't is because the legitimate refugees got the same urgency status as those without a home . 
  people that are able to live with family do n't get that status . 
  up until this point , the legitimate refugees got the same urgency declaration as those without a home . 
  other foreigners do n't got that status . 
  that 's doable ... if there was n't a war in that area ... 
   they are at their lowest point in 14 years . 
  not that strange , considering there has been a forced downwards pressure from the fallout of the financial crisis , and the reduction of the hypotheekrenteaftrek . 
  the prices are still inflated , and this has caused almost a standstill of the market , since houses are too expensive due to the loans on them , and yet people are unable to obtain a loan for those amounts due to the stricter regulations . 
   the problem is banks will at maximum lend you 4 times your yearly income which actually is a smart thing to do . 
  a 140000 loan ( 4 times 35,000 yearly ) at 5 % apr over 30 years , will cost you 270558.10 in total , or almost 8 times your yearly income , or about a quarter of your monthly income . 
   so even though you may be able to afford 710 euro per month rent , at 35,000 euro yearly income you can not buy a home that would cost you the same because the banks wo n't lend it to you and the government wo n't let you . 
  except that you also have to account for all the additional costs of home ownership that are non-existing for renters . 
  i 'm going to call you out here : you 're still living in one of the 18 largest municipalties of the netherlands . 
  95 % of the municipalties are smaller than the one you live in .

  history repeats itself . 
  dutch threshold is technically 0.66 % based on the number of seats . 
  they are all located in the ijsselmeer . 
  - divide the company in parts . 
  - send the money to the profiting parts - kill of the non-profiting parts - profit !,

  we already sweeped the place , and no additional dna samples were found . 
  what is this hairdresser you 're talking about ... we 've never found any evidence for a hairdresser involved in this . 
  your wife is your accomplice , because dna does n't lie !, 
  no , they robbed themselves by not joining the eurozone to begin with . 
  irony : in 2011 a picture of a spanish policeman on duty was the winner of the europol law enforcement photo competition . 
   nobody would be able to synthesize a copy of your dna either and plant it somewhere to frame you if that 's your worry . 
  not even needed . 
  your hairdresser has enough dna to not having to synthesize it . 
   i mean , why do people even vote for the vvd exactly ? 
  because they own a house . 
   apart from that -- 300w ? 
  yup , that 's how much graphics cards will be eating if we let the manufacturers free ... 1.5 amps in europe , or 3 amps in the us . 
  and by removing their children from the public school classrooms , the precentage of muslims increase even more . 
  17 gigagram of fish removed from the sea , only to get destroyed . 
   the parents and the ( adult ) child work together to find a suitable partner sadly , this is mostly not the case . 
  people sometimes lose contact with their parents and siblings over a suggested choice in partner ( and sometimes , that person is right and the proposed partner is a bad , bad fit ) . 
  children end up with no grandparents , that kind of stuff . 
   but you still end up with a partner who was selected with your best interest at heart . 
  your best interest , or the interest of the family as a whole ? 
  [ nice word association you got there . 
  over here in the netherlands we have those keypad protected lockboxes for defibs too . 
  the code for the keypad is either known at 112 , employees of the comany ( bhv ) , or at the phone number that 's on the box . 
   600 euro/month assuming 40 hours/week and 4 weeks/month , that 's 160 hours . 
  $ 600/160 = $ 3,75 / hour wot ? 
  theft of defibs will be tracked due to the build in gps unit :d, 
  can we just kick them out of the euro , let them crash and burn , and rise from the ashes like a phoenix ? 
  longer evenings mean shorter mornings . 
  the difference is avoidable vs. non-avoidable risks . 
  the difference is that asphalt fumes are a non-avoidable hazard of the job , where cigarette smoke is an avoidable part . 
  in addition , there are things like respirators and all kind of other safety equipment , and related legislation for those working with asphalt . 
  the difference ? 
  respirators and all kind of other safety equipment , and related legislation . 
  http://www.osha.gov/sltc/asphaltfumes/index.html in addition , where hazards are part of the job , the employer is required to minimize those hazards where possible . 
  smokers still infringe on the rights of the employees of the establishment . 
  ( if there is a fumoir with service ), 
  so ... daily exposure to avoidable known carcinogens is a requirement for the job ? 
  thanks to the information in your profile . 
  country : < country in europe  if you 're in the us , it 's a special case , since facebook is an european company , except for the us and canada . 
  we can see that !, 
  http://europe-v-facebook.org/en/data_pool/data_pool.html http://europe-v-facebook.org/en/get_your_data_/get_your_data_.html, 
  yep , especially since facebook is an european company ( except for u.s. and canada ) after all . 
  they are important , as these things are exactly the things you need to translate the language when no native resources are available . 
  basically , it 's about the preservation of knowledge . 
  it 's actually pretty simple . 
  - making fun of jews is just as bad as making fun of blondes - making fun of redheads is just as bad as making fun of blacks - making fun of asians is just as bad as making fun of females in each case , if the end result is discrimination , it shoud n't be allowed , because it deprives one group of people from the rights another group of people have . 
  - blondes are stupid , so no blondes on this university !, 
  would you allow a policy like that ? 
  the line is easily defined . 
  your rights end where the rights of another start . 
  everybody has the same rights . 
  it 's like telling an american that there were 0 people killed in the 2001-09-11 attacks . 
  no matter what your opinion is , the facts wo n't change . 
  nobody has the right to tell me what to believe or not to believe , or what to say or not to say , but neither do i have the right to tell others . 
  however , everybody has the right to tell others they are lying and call them out when they say things that are contrary to the actual facts that did happen . 
  in the mean time , the dutch muslims respond basically the same way they responded to fitna . 
   `` what people feel threatened by also threatens us . 
  what threatens westerners also threatens us . 
  there is no difference , ''  `` we want to tell our muslims brothers and sisters abroad , in the middle east , in pakistan , afghanistan , saudi arabia etc , that we as muslims in the netherlands are best positioned to analyse the situation in the netherlands , and to determine the response to wilders and others ... i am appealing to our brothers and sisters abroad to follow our strategy , not to frustrate our strategy by any violent incidents or an attack to a dutch embassy , ''  `` looking for conflict with the netherlands there is looking for conflict with us . 
  we are indivisibly dutch , indivisibly citizens of this country . ''  * ~ mohammed rabbae , chairman of the national moroccan council of the netherlands , speaking in the el ouma mosque , amsterdam , in response to fitna *, 
  and still , the eu only had a gross debt of 83 % of gdp in 2011 , while the us was at 102 % http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_public_debt#table:_international_debt_comparisons, 
  they never had much money to begin with . 
  for example the unemployment rate of spain in 2000 was already over 10 % , over three times as high as the netherlands .
