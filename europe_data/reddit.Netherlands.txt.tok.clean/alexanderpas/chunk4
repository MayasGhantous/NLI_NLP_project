  if we compare the uk with denmark or sweden , we see that the starting situation and the current situation is pretty equal . 
  in addition , corruption is a factor that adds to the problems . 
  on the other hand , joining the euro when it was high lead to more euros for everybody ( relative rich population . ), 
  when the people got less money , this would lead to the same result as devaluation ( less euros for everyone . ), 
   we 'll never be forced into a position like greece , portugal , spain and italy are in now . 
  they would n't either if they knew how to deal with money . 
  the countries hit hardest are the countries with the most corruption . 
  yet if we look at the eur-gbp exchange rate , we can see that after a significant drop , the rates have been climbing again . 
  brittain got hit way harder by the inital banking crisis . 
  and the nice thing is , the international standard allows for that . 
  all you need to do to adhere to the international standard is use ( small ) spaces between thousands, 
  there are international standards for decimal point notation . 
  iso 31-0 specified a ( small ) space as the thousands seperator , with both the dot and the comma reserved for the decmal sign . 
  ( this is consistent with the usage for binary and hexadecimal btw . ), 
  what 's the best way to increase the quality of power ? 
  buffers . 
  what works pretty nice as buffers ? 
  energy storage facilities . 
   these new coal power plants are required to compensate for the erratic output of wind and solar electricity generation units . 
  or a big ass battery . 
   we do n't have an energy problem ; we have an energy storage problem . 
  another case of an energy storage or transport problem . 
  tourist pricing . 
   dinner for two at a fast food restaurant ; or if you go to the mac . 
  - normal big mac menu for 2 persons and happy meal for 2 kids more things for $ 20 : - 5 ~ 6 grams of weed . 
  - 36 cans of coca cola . 
  ( 12 liter in total ) - 75 liter of the cheapest cola you can get . 
  - 1 000 000 liter of drinking water from the tap . 
  ( $ 0,02 / m ^ 3 ) - 120 litre of store bought water ( cheapest available ) - 5 litre of mineral water at a terrace . 
  have you looked at your country a couple of 100s year before ... 
  the people that had < $ 100 000 got their money back trough the deposit guarantee , and went on with their lives . 
  the governement is getting their money back , so it was just another loan for them . 
  the people that had above  $ 100 000 already have a part of their money back , and are getting the rest back too . 
  minimum wage seems to be [ ~ $ 750/month ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ml9s8a132hlg_&amp;met_y=minimum_wage&amp;idim=country:es&amp;fdim_y=currency:eur&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=spain+minimum+wage ) median wage seems to be [ ~ $ 2500/month ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_in_europe_by_monthly_average_wage ), 
  ladies night can exist without a change in the cost of admission , by focusing on music popular by only the ladies ( more `` sensitive '' music ) versus the usual music for example . 
  so you 're telling me that just because it 's a private institution it 's not discrimination ? 
  it is still discrimination based on gender , no matter the legality . 
  i think ladies night is okay , but not when there 's a difference in the cost of admission . 
  and that 's the point where you file a complaint against the club for gender-based discrimination . 
  ( just be sure to collect proof beforehand . ), 
  and it 's a clear case of gender-based discrimination . 
  time to make a complaint/lawsuit against them , it already happened in other countries . 
  would you like a smoke and a pancake ? 
  another reason why nuclear power plants are bad . 
  if a windmill or solar panel breaks , you do n't even notice it on the energy grid ; not to mention , it 's way easier to fix/replace those . 
  do n't worry , the dutch have overcapacity already ; we 'll gladly send some power your way for a reasonable price . 
  at least we can say now that ikea is a dutch brand , 
  all the ehic is is the european standardized version of a insurance card . 
  as long as you have valid health insurance coverage with one of the insurance companies or universal healthcare system ( depending on country ) , you can get an ehic to identify this fact . 
  your coverage is just what is specified in your insurance policy terms , the ehic does n't change this . 
  the data is unreliable . 
   compared to 15.3 % of the dutch [ statistics netherlands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statistics_netherlands ) and other sources indicate that the amount of people with no religious affiliation isabove 40 % in the year 2000 , and still rising , with some already putting the number at 60 % http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_the_netherlands#demographics, 
  i personally think this map is pretty accurate compared with my view on europe . 
   japan has a public debt of more than 200 percent of gdp it also has a small problem with a certain nuclear power plant . 
  fuck them !, 
  eurail passes are n't valid in great britain ( england , scotland and wales ) . 
  however , your pass does entitle you to discounts on travel to london with the eurostar train . 
  http://www.eurail.com/help/planning-your-trip/how-can-i-travel-and-london there are 2 ways to purchase a discounted eurostar ticket : - directly from eurostar terminals - by calling the eurostar booking center on +44 ( 0 ) 1233\u00a0617\u00a0575 http://www.eurail.com/help/planning-your-trip/eurostar-included-my-eurail-pass when i checked , the cheapest one-way ticket , from calais to london before that date was a standard , non flexible ticket ( a specific train ) for friday 3rd august 2012 and costs $ 67 without the discount . 
  ( cheapest one way in the weekend was $ 129 ) one way return ticket was $ 57 for the 7th , again without the discount . 
  we know , we know !, 
  and then we have the red cross . 
   i 'm 94.9 % certain . 
  that 's almost 2\u03c3 , come back when it 's 5\u03c3, 
  that too !, 
  but it was already dead over here !,

   talk to me when female circumcision is commonly practiced among millions of people . 
  female genital mutilation - ** description : ** partial or complete removal of the external female genitalia , or other injury to the female genital organs , for non-medical reasons . 
  ** areas practiced : ** western , eastern , and north-eastern africa , middle east , near east , southeast asia ** number affected : ** 120 ~ 140 million women and girls as of 1990 ~ 1997 ^ [ source ] ( http://books.google.nl/books?id=dvjip0rfvamc&amp;pg=pa6&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) --  female circumcision , in many case , removal of clitoris . 
  equivalent of clitoris on males is tip of penis . 
  - any non-accidental injury to the female genital organs , for non-medical reasons , is considered female genital mutilation . 
  - any non-accidental injury to the male genital organs , for non-medical reasons , is considered male genital mutilation . 
  they have no reason to complain . 
  the only reason for pickled herring , is when you ca n't have soused herring . 
  not to mention those that do n't want to understand you . 
  yet cyprus . 
  he means that as a compliment !, 
  how about unarmed operations ? 
   unless there is something about russia that i do n't know russia still makes flybys over international airspace , along the border of the eu/nato airspace . 
  also , do n't forget turkey . 
  i know , but when i copypasted the url , all i got were url escape codes . 
  [ it actually does ] ( http://i.imgur.com/anx1v.png ) , all you 're seeing are url escape codes, 
   you know what the biggest thing is keeping the brits from thinking of themselves as europeans ? 
  your coin . 
  yep , there 's uk , europe , eastern europe , scandinavia , italy , greece . 
  turkey wants to join , but both switzerland and norway do not . 
  the uk is because they still have their own coin ; and greece , we do n't talk about greece . 
  rape by female is usually not taken seriously enough . 
  [ even in the military themselves some hate it .

  that depends ... was the lemon the only evidence , besides the wrong place , wrong time . 
  depends on the amount of american soldiers still left ... at least a shorter route to the icc in the hague, 
  love the smaller printing of the zeroes on the old ones .
