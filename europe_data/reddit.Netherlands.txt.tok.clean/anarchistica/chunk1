yeah , atat\u00fcrk is a symbol of pro-western , secular turkey - erdogan is having none of that . 
  i bet he was reluctant to put up that banner too . 
  indonesian is listed twice for be , one instance is n't capitalised . 
  you oughta merge those . 
  weird that amsterdam has such a low percentage while it does have the second highest amount of nationalities . 
  goddamnit catholics , you 're an embarassment !, 
  thank poseidon there 's all those rivers keeping us safe . 
  the murder rate in the us is 4,3 times higher than here , so sadly that range works for them . 
  my own experience of meeting people from these countries in my hometown : * syria : n/a * russia : ~ 1996 ( aunt ) * afghanistan : 1993 ( primary school ) * serbia : ~ 1991 ( primary school ) * pakistan : ~ 2006 ( work ) * kosovo : n/a * somalia : 1993 ( primary school ) * eritrea : ~ 2006 ( work ) * iran : 1996 ( middle school ) * iraq : n/a i barely have to remember when conflicts happened , just when i met the refugees . 
  minimum youth wage is the reason why . 
  obviously , if you can pay teens less than $ 5 an hour ( less than $ 3 below 17 ! ), 
  there 's going to be little unemployment among them . 
  that 's insane , even my grandparents stop at like 23 or so . 
   is n't 1981 quite early for legalized abortion in a global context ? 
  the [ wiki-article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abortion_law ) seems to indicate it 's not in a western/non-third world context . 
  the law came into effect only in 1984 even . 
   it 's all part of the global times though : if the economy 's good , people become more liberal and focussed on changing things for the better nah , here labour just traded progressive laws for privitisations/liberalisations . 
  we imprisoned and castrated gays until 1971 ( !! ), 
  and three decades later we were the first country to legalise same-sex marriage . 
  we 've traditionally been an intolerant country ( even lutherans were n't allowed recognisable churches ) and change usually came slowly here ( abortion was legalised in 1981 ) . 
  after the nazis were kicked out we kept persecuting gays ( i.e. 
  male homosexuals ) . 
  it took 25 years of protesting before they got rid of the relevant law . 
  the first pro-gay demonstration was in 1969 and students got involved here . 
  it 's probably due to a combination of changing attitudes about sexuality throughout the western world , as well as more progressive attitudes among young people . 
  the next big change came near the end of the famous `` purple cabinet '' , named after the mix of red ( labour party ) and blue ( two liberal parties ) . 
  this was the first government since the institution of universal suffrage to exclude the christian-conservatives . 
  they legalised prostitution , euthanasia and same-sex marriage . 
  this seems to have been a fluke , we 're steadily regressing into stupid criminalisation of drugs , etc. 
  again . 
  they took a long time to decide where in the north sea we would get windmill parks . 
  like , literally until a couple of days ago . 
  we should be doing better once those are done . 
  i 'm surprised to see turkey and russia do so well . 
  have n't they convicted/murdered any journalists this year ? 
  ok , every historian who 's said otherwise in the last two decades is just wrong , than . 
  just because some groups go with it does n't mean you 're not conquered . 
  same with the nsb and the nazis , the patriots and napoleon , the shia & kurds and the us/uk , etc. 
  if a foreign power crosses your borders with 40.000 troops , fights a war against your head of state that lasts for years and kills thousands , and bans your army from the capital - that means you 're conquered . 
  this is a common misunderstanding , though in the last decade and a half more historians have started pointing it out . 
  the other william landed with 7000-12000 men , willem iii had 40.000 . 
  fighting lasted for years and thousands died . 
  during the occupation of london the english army was n't allowed anywhere near . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/adamson_04_08.html ) for instance . 
  basically what happened : * 1665-1667 : second anglo-dutch war . 
  dutch victory , truce with england . 
  * 1672 : england is bribed by france to break the truce and invade the republic and wipe it off the map ( with support of cologne and m\u00fcnster ) . 
  * 1674 : after four consecutive losses by the anglo-french fleet to michiel de ruyter , england gives in . 
  * 1677 : mary stuart marries willem iii . 
  france is worried and increases the war effort . 
  * 1678 : france agrees to a truce . 
  * 1688 : willem iii conquers england and turns it into a weapon against france . 
  * 1701-1714 : war of spanish succession . 
  willem iii beats louis xiv , france does n't unify with spain . 
  yay , we saved the world from having to speak french !, 
  london was occupied for months , fighting lasted for years and thousands died . 
  those traitors were taken by surprise but still put up a bit of a fight . 
  just because you call it the glorious revolution does n't mean you were n't conquered . 
  actually , england * was * conquered , willem iii 's army was twice the size of the spanish armada . 
  he made sure he did n't need local support . 
  you guys were an ok colony too . 
  it may in part be due to our neutrality in ww1 . 
  women have been under guardianship of their husbands here until the 1960 or so too . 
  switzerland also was extremely backward when it came to women 's rights . 
  paternal leave is fucking terrible here , it 's like two days paid . 
  that 's just because the lack of a `` not safe for ` murica '' tag . 
  it is something ignorant people say around here . 
  in reality our military budget is higher than iran , pakistan , indonesia , iraq , mexico and at least 150 other countries . 
  we have some of the best subs , apache helicopters , highly efficient self-propelled artillery ( ask the taliban ) , an excellent airforce ( we shot down a serbian mig-29 !, 
  ) , etc. 
  we also have an amphibic transport ship capable of transporting/supporting a battalion of marines , six apaches and four landing craft units . 
  plus a newer amphibic commando ship capable of transporting chinook helicopters and coordinating a division-sized operation ( up to 30.000 men ) . 
  on top of that we have six frigattes ( cannon range 24 km , 100 km in the future ) and next year the navy will get a brand-new joint logistic support ship . 
  we 're in the top 10 for military expenditures within nato ( which has 28 member states ) . 
  the eight countries above us have at least double our population . 
  i always thought croatia was even weirder ( hrvatska ) . 
  can they do it [ like this ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2eq1f7/can_you_name_european_countries_on_a_map/ck1zq4o ) :p, 
  thanks . 
  and yeah , i said so above , it 's cardiff ( which also has more people ) . 
  i just looked it up and i 'm kinda surprised to see helsinki is really called that . 
  i 'd expect some wacky sticked-together word . 
   it 's a bit more to the west it seems . 
  i considered doing provinces/regions and some of their capitals too , but that would require a larger map . 
  :p ( i only know a couple of those outside nl anyway ), 
  yeah , those south/eastern countries are a bit too much to remember . 
  hungary is actually `` magyarorsz\u00e1g '' , though i came pretty close . 
  `` i propose that 100,000 degenerate britons should be forcibly sterilized and others put in labour camps to halt the decline of the british race . '', 
  `` one might as well legalise sodomy as recognise the bolsheviks . '', 
  `` the love of plunder , always a characteristic of hill tribes '', 
  i tried native names + capitals + ` location ' of some capitals . 
  nearly forgot monaco . 
  also , i looked it up afterwards and the capital of wales is cardiff . 
  http://i.imgur.com/vmhbax1.jpg oh crap , forgot to add : bern has a * because it is n't technically the capital , just the capital of the federation . 
  lots of tacky pillars and friezes . 
  do n't you have any identity of your own ? 
  the strassbourg building is amazing , easily the best-looking . 
  bulgaria is the only one where they sit like in an archaic classroom . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  look nice on the outside , though .
