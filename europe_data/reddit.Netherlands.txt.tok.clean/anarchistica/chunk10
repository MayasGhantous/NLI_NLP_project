  i also have no problem with orthodox jews , fundamentalist hindus , maoists or neo-nazis moving elsewhere . 
  if evil is essential to your ideology you can just fuck off really . 
  jews who live here have integrated into society a long , long time ago , they wo n't care . 
  nah , i try to cut down on worship of evil , insane mass-murderers . 
  13 : `` 12 if you hear it said about one of the towns the lord your god is giving you to live in 13 that troublemakers have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray , saying , `` ** let us go and worship other gods ** '' ( gods you have not known ) , 14 then you must inquire , probe and investigate it thoroughly . 
  and if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among you , 15 ** you must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town ** . 
  you must destroy it completely , [ b ] both its people and its livestock . 
  16 you are to gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the lord your god . 
  that town is to remain a ruin forever , never to be rebuilt ''  it said circumcision of male children was `` an ancient religious tradition '' in judaism and islam and among some christian groups so is stoning people . 
   the resolution cast `` a moral stain on the council of europe , and fosters hate and ** racist ** trends in europe . '', 
  [ requirement ] ( http://www.nbn.org.il/aliyahpedia/getting-started/aliyah-processing-a-flight-logistics/1249-basic-documentation-requirements-.html ) to `` make aliyah '' , i.e. 
  `` return '' to israel . 
  proof of judaism : this is required for all adults in the family making aliyah . 
  acceptable proof of judaism is a letter from a recognized rabbi in north america or the uk , stating that you are jewish and ** born to a jewish mother ** . '', 
  please israel , could you be any more hypocritical ? 
   judaism -- as it has been practiced for millennia -- is no longer welcome in europe . 
  so because we do n't allow fgm islam is n't welcome , because we disallow discrimination based on birth hinduism is n't welcome and because we do n't allow witch-burnings christianity is n't welcome ? 
  judaism has countless laws that are absolutely unenforcable here and that jews themselves have abandoned a millennia ago . 
  a huge part of the ot is yahweh describing how you should build him a temple and sacrifice to him , it 's absolutely essential to him - have you ever heard of a jew doing that ? 
  judaism and islam can easily abandon one more primitive ritual , it 's not as if they 'll run out . 
  how is mutilating children a minor issue ? 
  let 's not insult people in the middle ages by comparing them to bronze age barbarians . 
  thanks , i selected and deleted a part by accident ( i had n't slept :p ) . 
   no , the country became part of the french empire in 1810 , till 1813 . 
  why do you think these trading posts were located on the coast ? 
  europeans were mostly limited to it until well into the 19th century . 
  they had to buy slaves from the locals , they did n't go out and enslave thousands themselves . 
  speaking very generally , like people , you can probably divide countries into along a private/personal and an accepting/normative axis . 
  ` private ' cultures are about the individual , emphasising personal space and personal responsability . 
  ` personal ' cultures are more open and hospitable , but also more likely to be clientelistic and into bribing . 
  in ` private ' cultures there is less corruption among ( especially low-level ) officials , instead businesses and high-level officials will make `` corruption '' official and legal . 
  the other axis would describe acceptance of divergence from the norm . 
  it does n't even have to be about progressiveness or conservativeness per se , more about how normal it is to show dislike for the abnormal . 
  the hardest culture to assimilate to is the one that is diagonally opposed to yours . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavia#terminology_and_use are you sure you did n't pick the wrong stars and stripes ? 
  we might have a winner . 
  the albanian language is its own branch of indo-european , its culture is a weird mix of unique elements plus slavic/turkish/greek influence and apparently they * love * the us . 
  truly the most bizarre place in europa . 
  that depends on the definition . 
  i actually came up with a history of the netherlands in 10 dates/20 pictures , but i never got around to posting it . 
  `` ruthless slave empire '' is n't exactly a detail , nor is forgetting about the first time we were annexed . 
   he is our george washington . 
  washington was n't made governor of new england by king george . 
    protestants like william of orange , an influential nobleman , were n't granted the same rights as catholics by the spanish king . 
  this resulted in an uprising . 
  philip ii actively opposed protestantism , prefered spanish advisors ( willem i was an advisor too ) and changed financial institutions to the detriment of local privileges . 
  he also instituted a new tax ( tiende penning ) . 
   after the independence in 1581 a new republic was founded that encompassed roughly the current benelux area . 
  no , after the union of atrecht in 1579 the southern netherlands sided with spain . 
   in the 1600s and 1700s his quickly evolved in a powerful but ruthless slave empire this is nonsense . 
  we sold slaves , had slaves in latin america and exploited the indonesians . 
  it was hardly a `` slave empire '' . 
  we likely most benefited from other people 's slaves ( tweede horigheid in polen ) . 
   jews and catholics were mostly tolerated and some were even influential in areas were many of them lived . 
  this is the first stirring of our culture of toleration and liberalism . 
  jews were actually granted more rights than catholics and even other non-calvinistic protestants . 
  they were free to worship in their own temples , for instance , while catholics had to do so in hidden churches or in the open air in secluded places . 
   in the colonies , however , the united east-indian company , the world 's first multinational , and the west-indian company enslave africans to ship them to foreign lands . 
  the voc was there to trade spices , not slaves . 
  also , the wic did n't enslave anyone , they bought slaves from africans , like everyone else . 
   napoleon put his brother on the throne when he conquered the netherlands . 
  in 1795 the batavian republic was formed under pressure of napoleon , it was only turned into a kingdom under louis napoleon in 1806 . 
   after the fall of the french empire the country remained a monarchy no , the country became part of the french empire in 1810 , till 1813 . 
   in the 1830s belgium and luxemburg become independent . 
  no , luxemburg stayed in a union under the monarch until 1867 . 
   1917 : women are allowed to vote , finalising the country as a full parliamentary democracy . 
  this happened in 1919 , in 1917 they were made electable . 
   after ww2 indonesia becomes independent after a bloody war between colonial powers and the indonesian natives . 
  the natives are heavily oppressed by colonial forces but are supported by the japanese eventually . 
  the japanese hinted at independence during ww2 but never actually went through with it . 
  after ww2 the indonesians rebelled and the japanese forces still present had to protect anyone not purely indonesian . 
  they became independent in 1949 after pressure from the un and especially the us . 
  some 250.000 indonesians were killed during the independence wars which we euphemistically call `` policing actions '' . 
   is a revelation for the dutch who are used to rather simple and bland types of food . 
  yeah , it 's not like the voc had been importing spices since the early 1600s . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;  the netherlands , one of europe 's main ww2 battlefields , is rebuilt with the marshal aid . 
  actually , we spent the marshal aid on invading indonesia . 
  how else could we support 100.000 + troops in 1947 ? 
    after a flood in the southwest in 1953 , killing thousands , the delta works are initiated . 
  they were already initiated but sped up after 1953 . 
   in the 1950s the first immigrants from ( former ) colonies such as suriname , the antilles and indonesia ( mostly the aforementioned maluku ) arrive . 
  `` first '' is obviously the wrong term here , there was a increase of emigration mostly related to various independence dates . 
   others major groups include spaniards , moroccans and turkish . 
  the latter two bring islam to the netherlands . 
  the later two were brought over mostly after 1963 . 
  they were meant as guest workers who would eventually leave . 
  by bringing them we could avoid having women enter the labour market in droves , which is part of the reason why we 're still backward when it comes to female labour participation . 
   a conservative minister of health - of all people - partially legalizes pot . 
  marijuana ( use ) was never legalised * de jure * , only officially tolerated . 
   for the first time in decades , only secular parties govern for the first time since the institution of universal suffrage , actually . 
  _____ who was your history teacher in school ? 
  kinda amusing to see suriname get on board with this . 
  their president bouterse is a wanted criminal who tortured and murdered 15 political opponents after his coup and made millions from the drug trade . 
  his government is so corrupt it 's almost a parody . 
  he made his son head of a new `` anti-terrorism '' unit . 
  he was arrested after being entrapped by us agents after he tried to set up a network to illegally trade weapons . 
  bouterse also created a law that prevented him from being prosecuted for the political murders . 
  his son claims it was to prevent us ( netherland ) from getting a grip on the country , lol . 
  they brought it up here when we wanted to ban halal/kosjer meat . 
  governments ( including that of israel ) already `` dramatically '' restrict what people can do in the name of religion , these barbarians should n't pretend as if it is anything new .
