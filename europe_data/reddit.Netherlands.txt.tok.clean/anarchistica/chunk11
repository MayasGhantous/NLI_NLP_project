   germany 's central council of jews called it `` an unprecedented and dramatic intrusion on the right to self-determination of religious communities . '', 
  i agree , this is clearly anti-semitic . 
  jews should also be allowed to kill homosexuals , non-virgin brides , children who are disobedient or insult a parent , non-jews , adulterers and people who work on saturdays . 
  if your parents had chopped off your pinkies when you would n't miss them either . 
  it would 've been more humane too . 
  he also deported a girl who turned out to have leukemia , two people who were on a hunger strike for weeks and had a russian political refugee commit suidice in one of his refugee jails . 
  and lots of people who 've worked in the refugee prison system , like medical professionals , have opened up about how shitty it is . 
  but according to teeven nothing is wrong . 
  even the unhrc has stated that locking up refugee children is adverse to basic human rights ... 
  just one thing ? 
  we could do without a non-leftist , non-progressive majority . 
  but to be more specific we could do without [ fred teeven ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fred_teeven ) . 
  he imprisons refugees ( including children ) , says we can take in only 50 syrian refugees and thinks poor people should n't have the right to an attorney . 
  so what 's more important than transsexuals not being required to be sterilised to have their gender recognised ? 
   on all those things we are the most liberal country in the world . 
  no , we 're not . 
  portugal has better soft drug laws , switzerland has better euthanasia laws , lots of countries have betters trans rights , many countries treat refugees much better . 
  * full equality of gsms * , especially transsexuals . 
  * legalised soft drugs , especially growth thereof . 
  * less restrictive euthanasia laws . 
  * no more imprisonment of refugees , especially children . 
  * etc. 
  mostly it would be nice if we had our first left-wing government ever . 
  ** gender and sexual minorities *, 
  i 'm surprised all those buildings were still structurally sound and worth fixing up . 
  i wonder if they did the same in belgrado . 
  why would the party for the wealthy ( vvd ) do anything about this ? 
  no , the liberal / `` labour '' government does so . 
  this guy is just the star of a theater group we pay tens of millions a year to cut ribbons , read speeches and drive around in golden carriages . 
  what 's mostly happening is the unravelling of the myth of nl as an egalitarian country . 
  income inequality has grown thanks to deregulation and privitisation and will keep growing until 2040 , especially with increasing life expectancy . 
  around that point our natural gas supply runs out which will raise the cost of heating and reduce government income by 10 + mld . 
  further cuts will have to be made . 
  they 're trying to instill in people the idea that these are necessary so that 25 years from now there wo n't be riots . 
  they actually leave out certain costs nowadays ( like maintenance of their yacht ) , the figure used to be much higher . 
  having a populist or nationalist party in parliament has been shown to help channel people 's feelings of discontent . 
  by artificially keeping them out you only augment these feelings . 
  it 's quite undemocratic , if only because you throw away millions of votes . 
  yeah , but it would 've been her third language , and reading and speaking are two different things entirely . 
  i can read de and fr ( my third and fourth languages ) , but i doubt it could make a correct sentence longer than two words . 
  she grew up in the ddr so she learnt to speak russian as a second language instead of english . 
  she was 35 when the wall fell , so she probably does n't have the same affinity for/familiarity with english as we do . 
  plus , she 's a conservative politician from a conservative country whose trademark is boring stability . 
  her staff will not let her take * any * unnecessary risks . 
  i mean , jeez , she had to be groomed to position her hands in a certain way - no way is she going to hold a speech in a foreign country in her third language with an accent many people probably find amusing . 
  it depends on how much influence they would be able to exert and how much influence brussel would get over them . 
  on one hand , it would become the second most populous eu country and gain significant influence in its various institutions . 
  on the other hand , they would have to abide by eu law , which could have a `` civilising '' influence . 
  i think turkey would at the very least have to improve its human rights record to show its good intentions . 
  and even then , do we really want the epp ( europarliament conservatives ) to be even bigger ? 
  for now , no . 
  if the eu proves it can improve backward nations like hungary , perhaps - in the distant future .

  not sure if `` women on their period have to wear a headband to show it '' constitutes class . 
   the majority of the blame lies with the un anyway . 
  no , it lies with the people who did the actual killing .

  we actually still have a tiny part of de .

  [ * cough * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sint_eustatius ), 
  we tried that after ww2 . 
  it was instituted in the late 19th century so more people could afford a house . 
  however , they stupidly decided that the deductable amount increases with the value of the house . 
  of course , it became a `` villa-subsidy '' , with half going to the richest 20 % ( income of $ 100.000 + ) in 2008 . 
  their deaths and lead-up to it are painful and gruesome , but they lead better lives before that - compared to cattle raised for milk and slaughter . 
  to give just one example ; in my country , one in four milk-cows has infected udders . 
  also , the numbers are utterly insignificant . 
  in my country of 16,7 million people we slaughtered more bulls last year - 52.800 . 
  this was just 8,4 % of all adult cattle slaughtered , or 2,7 % of all cattle slaughtered . 
  or , to make it absolutely clear : in 2012 , we , a country with 1/3rd the population of spain , slaughtered more bulls than were killed in bullfights there . 
  ** and this represented only 0,01 % of all animals slaughtered . 
  you 're right , it is actually more humane . 
  it 's really bizarre , and seems incorrect . 
  according to another post here the antifas showed up to oppose the neo-nazis . 
  i wonder how they got the $ 1100 number , that is the absolute minimum you have to pay . 
  the most amusing thing is that people with low wages get an allowance that helps pay for this . 
  so in an attempt to cut costs , they have created a system where the government directly funds healthcare providers ' profits . 
  something fairly similar happened when they privatised social housing . 
  we 've still got a housing shortage - since ww2 ! - and a handful of corporations make lots of money , which they invest in useless prestige projects . 
  i 've got a very low wage and i get about $ 4000/year in subsidies , which go directly to the fancy offices of the healthcare and housing corporations . 
  got ta love capitalism . 
   we also invented reality tv as it exists today . 
  sorry world .
