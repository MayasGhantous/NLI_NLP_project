  nowadays they 're the center of intra-european politics and sort of our baby brother . 
  they were the second to legalise country-wide same-sex marriage after us , and have been fairly progessive otherwise too . 
  in the last few decades they 've mostly made the news because of the augusta schandal , pedo-networks , female singles tennis and the language-divide . 
  it ca n't be easy to be belgium . 
  they have many of the same problems we do ( populism/migration ) , plus the language thing , an even smaller population ( 11 mln ) and they lack the deep historical roots we have ( anglo-saxon cooperation , etc. ) . 
  i really wonder what 's gon na happen , perhaps the benelux ( the 1941 precursor to the eeg/eu/eyc ) will become more of a federation in the future ? 
  please point out where i said there would be no rules . 
  it can be , if you create a society based on voluntary cooperation . 
  btw , flappie ook een [ clown ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rodopxsb39q ) . 
   anarchy is the worst possible situation a person can find themselves in . 
  see , that 's why i mentioned the book thing . 
  anarchists want anarchism , not anarchy . 
  anarchism is a state of society in which there are no established elites , voluntary cooperation is the modus operandi and people take care of both themselves and others . 
  such a society would avoid negative incentives , like striving for economical or political power . 
  what you describe is what libertarians want . 
  an initially stateless society where some are able to get a head start due to luck . 
  these people would then be allowed to exploit others through capitalism , using the threat of starvation ( if not others ) as `` motivation '' . 
  antifa = / = anarchist . 
  also , i do n't see a single example . 
  i mean really , how hard is it to understand that sentence ? 
  look up the word `` single '' , flappie . 
  these are events in the past ( note your use of `` already '' ) . 
  also , i was talking about anarchists , not commies . 
  we have little love for them . 
   they are both destructive ( the far left probably more ) to people 's already comfortable lives . 
  give a single example . 
  yes , because anarchists are just like religious extremists and criminals . 
  maybe you should pick up a book once in a while . 
  & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; edit : it says a lot about / r/europe that someone who equates leftist progressives to oppressors and criminals gets upvoted . 
  you have a lower population density and 20-25 % are students . 
  it would make sense if there was n't that much motor traffic . 
  is there really a lot of traffic way up in the north east ? 
  it also explains why france and us rate highest for `` silliest accent '' instead of you guys . 
   swerve left and right through motorized traffic except we have separate bike lanes everywhere . 
  the church was on the side of the fascists , and the republicans consisted mostly of atheist-leaning communists and anarchists . 
  however , it was mostly a battle of ideologies . 
  i do n't think that really matter , though . 
  fighting against a dictator is n't much different from fighting the established elite . 
  if the spanish civil war is any indication , they will return as writers and poets . 
   it was a narrative of victimhood and decline that i 'd often heard in china . 
  ( historians also tend to blame the stifling effects of bureaucracy and authoritarianism , among other factors . ), 
  nb : take this with a grain of salt . 
  there are other factors that are seen as far more important , like the poor accessibility of charcoal . 
   food , pleasure not the same thing . 
  in case of meat , they definitely are . 
   law and regulations have been put in place to make the lives of animals better in terms of living conditions , it is true that they are n't anywhere near where they should be . 
  what would make lifelong imprisonment ok ? 
   difference is those animals are put out of their misery as fast as possible . 
  not really . 
  for instance , milk cows live painful lives for at least 4 years before they are slaughtered . 
  one in four has infected udders . 
  one to three in four has leg injuries . 
  some 30 % never goes outside . 
  oh , and producing 8000-12000 liters of milk per year is rather tiring and painful too . 
  in comparison , bullfighting bulls have a relatively decent life . 
   those bulls are made to suffer for tourists pleasure . 
  and livestock is made to suffer for meateaters pleasure . 
  your point being ? 
  * every year , 10.000 to 40.000 bulls are killed during bullfights in spain . 
  worldwide the number is 250.000 . 
  * in 2012 , some 1.933.700 bovines were slaughtered here . 
  farmers receive subsidies , tax breaks , etc. 
  pot , meet kettle . 
  also slaughtered with subsidies : * pigs : 14.317.700 * sheep : 584.500 * goats : 117.800 * normal-grown chickens : 14.983.600 and the big one : * [ plofkippen ] ( http://www.transitiecultuur.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/plofkip1.jpg ) : ** 520.562.400 ** that 's a total of over 552.000.000 animals slaughtered with subsidies . 
  sure , you can have limburg and noord-brabant . 
  have fun with wilders and his supporters !, 
  i doubt anyone takes it lightly . 
  if anyone wants to kill themselves , they 'll find a way . 
  this way , there are no traumatised train drivers among things . 
  [ context ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mozjlw8jzag ) . 
  just got a great idea : you can have our king !, 
  we 'll go back to being a non-ovarocracy !, 
  ps : stelletje na\u00e4pers . 
  nee , dat is correct nederlands . 
   most euthanizing governments ever . 
  switzerland is the most progressive country in this regard , actually . 
  yup . 
  but basically the whole `` locking innocent people up '' thing is retarded . 
  yes , come to nl , it worked out great for the last political refugee we got from russia . 
  you can see all the urban centers ; lisboa , madrid , barcelona , lyon , milan , paris , etc. 
  the overly bright lighting the belgians use is visible too , and it 's amusing to see how rural nl is outside the randstad . 
  i also like how you can see the mediterranean coastline and the nile . 
  now now , do n't be mean to southern european countries about their infrastructure . 
  i hardly think public defenders constitute `` welfare '' . 
  also , i think you missed the part where they only slashed taxes and maintained subsidies for the rich . 
  it 's hardly a caricature . 
  the liberal party here has been making cuts in pretty much everything people who do n't make $ 100.000 benefit from , while shielding villa subsidies ( mortage interest deductability ) and lowering taxes for businesses . 
  they 've even suggested that if you cant afford a lawyer , you do n't deserve one . 
  they want to raise rents so they can tax the failing housing corporations they created , while making sure 93 out of the 100 richest corporations can keep dodging taxes here . 
  and let 's not forget the bailouts for the banks they deregulated . 
  in my middle school class there were a bunch of jovd ( liberal party youth wing ) members , while i was one of just two vocal left-wingers . 
  we now work for ngos , they work for the state . 
  heck , one of them even works for the [ esm ] ( http://www.esm.europa.eu/about/organisation/kalin-anev.htm ) . 
  well , liberal is not the same as liberal . 
  liberals mostly just care about money and making sure rich folk stay that way . 
  they 're fine with swinging conservative or progressive . 
  * in the past ruled by zog i , who was premier , president and finally king . 
  srsly , king * zog * , how cool is that ? 
  * they also had some ruler called hoxha . 
  * they love the us .
