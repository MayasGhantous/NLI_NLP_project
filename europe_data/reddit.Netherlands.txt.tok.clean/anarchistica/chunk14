  us officials go there to feel good about themselves . 
  * capital is tirana , red flag with double-headed eagle in black . 
  * they had a big boating accident in the late 90s ( mentioned in a popular song here ) . 
  * they 're not slavs , nor is their language slavic . 
  * i think kosovo has a bunch of albanians and this caused friction . 
  * occupied by italy during ww2 . 
  * agn\u00e8se bojaxhiu ( mother theresa ) was albanian . 
  * i believe they 're infamous for having so many stolen cars . 
  did n't some albanian ambassador get caught in one ? 
  i went to the basisschool when you were born , and i might be misremembering this . 
  i went to primary school ... a bit longer ago , and i remember some schools teaching either of those instead of english ... though perhaps i misremember and they only considered doing that . 
  i did n't know we stopped teaching fr/de in primary schools . 
  it 's interesting to see how we diverge from the norm . 
  we start late , but we 're also one of the few countries where two foreign languages are mandatory in secondary education . 
  and we do start on latin and/or ancient greek earlier than most countries ( 2nd grade/age ~ 13 , if attending gymnasium ) . 
  judging by how awful our language education has become , i think we could do with a change . 
  srsly , my proficiency at english is considered exceptional here . 
  :p i also had an 8 for both fr and de , but i can barely form a sentence in either of those . 
  and do n't get me started on my understanding of latin or ancient greek ... 
  capitals are overrated anyway . 
  we have amsterdam , but den haag is the judicial and governmental center . 
  bonn still has ~ half of all government institutions/employees . 
  south africa even has 3 `` capitals '' . 
   no sorry . 
  schweiz is the `` informal '' name in german . 
  already wondered why you guys have . ch . 
  i said `` official '' for a reason . 
  de is the dominant language , so one would * assume * most swiss people call it die schweiz . 
  i 'm only listing stuff i think i know . 
  for instance , i did n't know ch is almost the same size as nl and has about half as many people . 
   ban the building of minarets . 
  ( facepalm ) which is kinda amusing , since those are [ awesome ] ( http://i1122.photobucket.com/albums/l537/erik_esteie/zaandam/godshuizen/kermes15mei112.jpg ) . 
  i know that ( i 've even been to the schwarzwald ) , but most people do n't . 
  * `` official name '' : die schweiz . 
  * capital : bern . 
  although technically they have multiple capitals since they 're confederated . 
  * currency : francs . 
  * administrative division : cantons . 
  * flag : red with white cross . 
  * henry dunant , founder of the red cross , was born there . 
  he simply reversed the colours to get the flag for his organisation . 
  * legalised euthanasia , even for visitors , without many restrictions ( like we have ) . 
  * like we had the batavian republic under napoleonic rule , they had the helvetic republic . 
  in both cases , there is no actual direct descendance ( they mixed with others ) . 
  * speak de , fr and it . 
  * neutral , and remained so by having big rocks they can drop on roads . 
  most of the army consists of reserves , and many swiss people own guns because of that . 
  not sure if they 're compulsory , that might be norge . 
  * due to its neutrality used to draw up certain treaties , most importantly the geneva conventions . 
  * like other small states , they use dubious financial constructions to make money . 
  in their case , anonymous banking accounts . 
  the place to be if your a nazi or a greek politician with some money to hide . 
  * zurich is an important banking center . 
  * recent campaigns against migrations/mosques ended with a somewhat succesful referendum . 
  not sure what it did though . 
  * famous for : alps , cuckoo clocks , chocolate , cheese , knives . 
  * pretty much the only other country where calvinism was dominant . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  church attendance is not a requirement for religiousness . 
   the other 50,000 who joined the british army who were not enlisted in the irish army at the time were not punished . 
  ok , i did n't know that . 
  but the `` deserters '' were discriminated , as were their families . 
   ireland did n't punish anyone for joining the allies during ww2 . 
  the only people who were punished were soldiers who deserted their posts in the irish army during ww2 . 
  i 'm not sure if any were on active deployment . 
  and while it is true they were judged to be deserters , they were also discriminated against as traitors for fighting alongside the uk . 
   it is not fair for you to make such sweeping statements . 
  sweeping statements ? 
  i 'm just listing what i think i know about the roi . 
  yeah , i was n't sure how to word it , but ireland recently received financial aid from the imf and eu , which led to them being lobbed in with the other southern european countries . 
   a few things wrong like ? 
   `` deeply catholic , '' nope , ireland now has one of the highest rates of people abandoning religion in the world . 
  over 84 % of the population identified as catholic in 2011 . 
   only people who volunteered for the british army were punished http://www.irishtimes.com/news/government-apologises-to-wwii-veterans-1.1384900, 
  * former part of british empire , independent in 1922 . 
  * speak a gaelic language . 
  * population equal to norway ( 4,5 mln ) . 
  * acted like a heaven for banking , like their `` neighbour '' with the nearly identical name ( iceland ) . 
  * severe death toll due to british mismanagement during 19th century potato famine . 
  * deeply catholic , which combined with their relatively low gdp makes them a `` southern european '' country . 
  * recent scandal with power abuse by religious institutions , with girls as young as 10-12 being imprisoned and forced into labour for the most minor of offenses ( e.g. 
  getting a fine ) . 
  * also a recent scandal with sexual abuse in the catholic church , of course . 
  * worldly and religious power being deeply entwined allowed this to grow and continue for so long . 
  * neutral in ww2 , and punished people for volunteering to fight on the side of the allies . 
  * thanks to terrorism , northern ireland will be reunited with the rest in 2024 - according to star trek tng . 
  this was censored from the episode until very recently in the uk . 
  * home of the cranberries , jj72 , the corrs and u2 . 
  the latter decided to be nl instead so they would n't have to pay taxes . 
  * i could n't name a single politician or sports team , which would indicate ireland has little relevance in those areas . 
  lol @ downvotes . 
  i 'm just listing what i think i know about ireland , do n't be a fucking crybaby about it . 
  i doubt the vvd cares about anything besides money . 
  they had an effective campaign with posters promising simple suggestions that they were n't going to ever implement anyway . 
  also , some people voted strategically to oppose the `` red terror '' . 
  interesting to see how poorly sweden did , they 've really taken a turn to the right . 
  the difference between median and lowest wage in my country is probably due to people working parttime . 
  tiny island beneath sicilly that used to be a crusader state ( like rhodos ) . 
  later became part of the british empire like many mediterranean islands ( creta , cyprus , etc. ) . 
  capital is valletta .
