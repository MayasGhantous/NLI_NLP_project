  i believe that with the money they saved on him they can fly a jsf for about half an hour . 
  why 's there a connecticuter on there ? 
  what about the greeks and the assyrians ? 
  deir yassin ( 107 by irgun and lehi ) is n't listed either . 
  at least irgun 's hotel bombing is mentioned ( 91 by irgun ) . 
  i 've never thought about it but it 's kinda amusing how the three deadliest terrorist attacks in can\u00e4an were committed by zionists . 
  here we go with the `` first '' genocide of the 20th century thing again . 
  and they do n't mention that the kurds helped the turks . 
  they still live where the armenians used to live . 
  i guess at least they mentioned the assyrians . 
  edit : lol , downvotes for pointing out there were earlier 20th century genocides ? 
   with 150 casualties , this remained the deadliest terrorist attack in history for ~ ~ 36 ~ ~ 15 years . 
  haganah killed 267 people in 1940 . 
  to be fair , it is hard to tell what you guys are mumbling . 
  of course the percentage is higher per area . 
  those 6 million killed were 66 % of jews in europe . 
   `` the first , which is widely considered ` the first genocide of the 20th century ' , struck your own armenian people , '' this is incorrect , and it 's quite disturbing that someone with a pr department would make such a mistake . 
  while you could claim that the persecution of the armenians started in the late 19th century , it was hardly genocide yet . 
  the first genocides ( afaik ) of the 20th century were the killings of up to 50-90 % of the herero and nama ( `` hottentotten '' ) people by the germans . 
  these were the most succesful genocides i know of . 
  in comparison , the genocides that were part of the holocaust killed 25 % of the romani ( `` gypsies '' ) and 35 % of the jews . 
  really ? 
  works fine here . 
  i 've bolded some of the hilariously delusional bullshit they put in there . 
  seriously , if you think the vvd is `` centre-right '' but the pvv is `` far right '' you must be smoking something pretty strong . 
  of course , this is the publication that declared the us to be more democratic than israel , so i doubt any sane person will take them seriously . 
  _____ the dutch perpetuated their reputation for quaintness on wednesday by holding national waterschapsverkiezingen ( `` water-scape elections '' ) , choosing administrators for the dikes and canals that prevent their low-lying country from sinking into a swampy morass . 
  they also voted for the country 's provincial assemblies , and that election threatens to drag the country into a different sort of morass . 
  in the provincial assemblies , which choose the country 's senate , the six largest parties each received between 10 % and 16 % of the vote . 
  this splintering of the senate may make it impossible for the centrist government to get anything done . 
  like voters across much of europe , the dutch are turning away from the traditional parties of power , and creating an ever more complicated political landscape . 
  related topics the dutch case is especially confusing because , while voters have turned against the government , they have not actually turned to the right or left . 
  since 2012 the netherlands has been ruled by a grand coalition of the ** centre-right ** liberals and the centre-left labour party . 
  the government never had a majority in the senate , and to get its programme passed it has allied with three other parties , each of which demanded concessions . 
  it has pushed through ambitious housing reforms and deficit-cutting measures , but those measures have not been popular , even among its own voters . 
  liberal voters have had to swallow excise tax hikes . 
  labour voters feel their party is implementing the austerity policies of the right . 
  a stagnant economy and high unemployment have not helped . 
  because the government is centrist , opposition to its policies has scattered voters in every direction . 
  both parties were punished on wednesday , but labour was hit hardest . 
  the changes will not be official until the provincial assembly deputies vote in may , but based on the election results , labour will drop from 14 seats to just eight in the 75-seat senate . 
  the liberals remain the largest party , but will fall from 16 seats to 13 . 
  the biggest winners were the centre-right christian democrats , who will have 12 seats , and the ** left-liberal ** d66 party , who will go from five to 10 . 
  there was less action on the fringes . 
  the ** far-right ** party for freedom of geert wilders dropped from 10 senators to nine , while the ** far-left ** socialist party rose from eight to nine . 
  that only accounts for the top six of the 12 parties . 
  among the smaller ones , greenleft lost a senator , the party for the animals won one , and the more religious christian parties did well . 
  the fact that the unapologetically left-wing socialists have outpaced centrist labour , for the first time , is seen as significant . 
  but for the most part , dutch voters voiced their discontent with the centrist government by voting for the centrist opposition . 
  the next big step on the government 's agenda is tax reform . 
  labour and the liberals both want to reward work by cutting the netherlands ' high income tax rates , which currently reach 42 % for those earning $ 33,589 ( $ 35,922 ) per year , and 52 % for those making $ 57,585 or more . 
  but it is hard to see how the government can put together a majority in the senate . 
  mark rutte , the prime minister , optimistically predicted that the splintering of the senate means that `` every party must take responsibility '' for helping to pass legislation . 
  but both d66 and the christian democrats can now `` make or break any deal '' , says andr\u00e9 krouwel , a political analyst . 
  while d66 has worked with the government , the christian democrats have refused to . 
  much of the voters ' frustration stems from austerity measures the government has enacted over the past two years , such as cuts in health benefits and hikes in excise taxes . 
  but the elections have actually strengthened the political forces demanding austerity . 
  both d66 and the christian democrats insist that the government commit in advance to new deficit-cutting measures to balance out any tax cuts . 
  that is anathema to labour . 
  the liberals and labour may yet manage to cobble together temporary alliances of other parties to push bills through . 
  meanwhile , the economy is improving ; the official government forecaster predicts 1.7 % growth this year , and consumer sentiment has turned positive for the first time since 2007 . 
  if the senate grinds to a halt , the improving economy could tempt the government ( particularly the less unpopular liberals ) to take its chances on new elections to the lower house of parliament . 
  perhaps next time dutch voters will send a less confused message . 
  eh , we 're already smarter anyway .

  a tiny version of the original picture on a shit image host with no link to the original ? 
   reminds me , why do you not get worked up over beeing called dutch/deutsch in english ? 
  that 's us nowadays , not you , after all . 
  i do n't like that either , but at least that old word for ` people ' includes netherlanders from all twelve provinces . 
  those * farmers * from outside the randstad already have an inferiority complex . 
  :p even the plural ( netherlands , niederlande , pays-bas ) used by you foreigners is technically wrong . 
  we 're not the `` republic of seven united netherlands '' nor the `` united kingdom of the netherlands '' anymore . 
  i 'd never thought i would be told off for using the native name for a country . 
  wtf . 
  is that some weird bavarian custom ? 
  that 's why we think of that when we think of \u00c9ire . 
  the misunderstanding dates back to republican times ( 1581-1795 ) . 
  the republic of the seven united netherlands was more or less a federation , dominated by the coastal provinces holland and zeeland ( hence new holland aka australia and new zeeland ) . 
  people would identify themselves by their province of origin . 
  the navy predominantly employed people from these two provinces , and holland was far more populous . 
  so most of the time foreigners would meet someone calling themselves a ` hollander ' and people would assume he was from a country with the same name . 
  the usage nowadays in anarchronistic and plain wrong , like calling all of the uk `` england '' or eastern spain `` aragon '' . 
  i do n't think the stereotype is quite as pervasive here . 
  the first things that come to mind for me are the ira and tax evasion . 
  holland ceased to be in 1840 , so no . 
   calling it `` non-democratic '' is hyperbole . 
  no , it is n't . 
  it disproportionately affects smaller parties . 
   source ? 
  because that sounds like total bullshit to me . 
  you must be talking about people who are n't american citizens . 
  i was surprised too , i actually guestimated the increase since 2008 ( 5,3 ) too low - it 's 5,85 million now . 
  http://www.sentencingproject.org/template/page.cfm?id=133  every adult american can vote . 
  to me that 's my general standard for a democracy . 
  but not all votes count equally , nor do they have much choice . 
  and an insane amount of votes are effectively discarded because of fptp . 
  not to mention that the amount of representatives is low . 
  in the us the rate of representation is 1:595.000 ( rep. / people ) . 
  in the netherlands it 's 1:75.000 ( 8 times better ) . 
  how about disenfranchisment ?
