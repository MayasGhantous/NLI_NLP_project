  some 5,5 million people ca n't vote in the us because of it . 
   i ca n't agree that anything less makes a nation `` non-democratic '' why not ? 
  i you give votes weight you 're not representing the people 's opinion correctly . 
  no , you said something , you did n't present anything . 
  almost no countries would pass my strict definition . 
  nl does , and maybe belgium , denmark , etc. 
  but the us and uk fail all but the most generous definitions . 
  for instance : `` every adult citizen has an equal vote . '', 
  does n't even apply to them . 
   so please do start saying something discussion worthy because you did ? 
  probably because he 's from a non-democratic , duopolic country . 
  they do the same in the us . 
  well yeah , if i watched more fox like you do i 'd be better informed to discuss the stuff you 're making up . 
  lol . 
   do you believe europe ( eu ) should develop a self-sufficient military for defense or continue relying on the us ? 
   do you believe europe ( eu ) should develop a self-sufficient military for defense  ** for defense **, 
  according to 2013 sipri data the current eu countries had a combined military budget of 220,9 milliard . 
  that 's 2,5 times as much as russia 's 87 mld . 
  this also excludes europe 's third military power , the uk ( 57 mld ) . 
  france , the uk , germany and italy were all in the top 11 for expenditures . 
  oh yeah , relying on the us so hard . 
  lol, 
  ** cunt-hooks ** is correct though . 
  i just counted the fs in the usaf . 
  they might , the benelux has been at forefront of european cooperation . 
  they made up half of the original ecc for one thing . 
  oh no , how will we ever invade foreign countries that never attacked us ? 
  they 've got 3 mig-21s , those are actually three times as fast as a warthog . 
  both countries have at least 60 f-16s . 
  combined we 've got 4,4 fighters per million people versus 5,2 for you . 
  not really . 
  the thunderbolt ** ii ** is mostly useful against armored vehicles . 
  other than that it 's a bit slow for cas and obviously not suited for a role as interceptor . 
  we should just get him some floppy shoes and red lipstick , he 's already got the funny hair . 
  do each of the participants ( except mr. pooh ) say something ? 
  so ... what exactly is going on ? 
  why else would they want to go to sweden if they 're already in germany ? 
  why only this group ? 
  `` several sat down on the platform and refused to leave the station . 
  they said they wanted to go to sweden . 
  `` we want sweden '' , the refugees shouted , as in-online reported . 
  other slogans rang `` merkel help us '' . 
  they even refused food offered by citizens of l\u00fcbeck . '', 
  and what does in-online say ? 
  `` a group of 51 refugees refused resolutely to leave the station . 
  ** they wanted to go on to sweden , to their families ** . '', 
  how thankless of them that they wanted to go to their relatives !, 
   fucking absurd that someone does things like this based on a religion belief . 
  you do n't think russia invading chechnya and killing tens of thousands had anything to do with this ? 
  it 's partly fictional though . 
  i think i 've only ever once heard someone actually speak zaans . 
   what exactly is a `` genocide '' ? 
  there are a number of definitions , some of them conflicting . 
  the term itself comes from the words * gens * [ family ] and * caedere * [ to kill ] . 
  because of that first word i exclude religion as a reason for destruction , especially since there 's usually overlap between religion and ethnicity in these cases . 
  so here 's my definition ; ** genocide ** 1 . 
  a group is targeted based on its actual or supposed familial relation . 
  the primary reason for attacking this group is to destroy them , for as far as they are within your grasp . 
  seems simple , right ? 
  it is n't . 
  to expand on this ; 1 . 
  the target is considered to be inherently flawed because of its familial origin . 
  no matter what the target does , it can not be ` fixed ' . 
  this is why i exclude religion as a reason , since you can convert . 
  the offender determines this familial relation . 
  it can be based on ethnicity ( us : race ) or ( supposed ) membership of a nation of people - like the nazis considered the jews to be . 
  the attack on this group originally happens to destroy it . 
  if members of the group fight back it is still genocide ( instead of war ) . 
  this intent is derived from actions , whether or not it is stated is irrelevant . 
  destruction can be indirect , such as through the reduction of food sources , or forced sterilisation and other means of reducing births . 
  some examples of things i do not consider to be genocide : * kongo vrijstaat/british india : leopold ii and the british killed millions to make money , not to wipe them out . 
  * axis vs slavs : while the slavic peoples were considered to be inferior and little to no effort was made to keep them alive , hitler and co. did not attempt to destroy them as a group . 
  * islamic state vs yezidis : the is wants to establish religious purity . 
  it has attempted to convert them , which means they 're not seen as * inherently * flawed . 
  * bosnian war ( except cases like srebreni\u00e7a ) : for most of the war the serbs were content to simply drive out the muslims and bosniaks . 
  this is ethnic cleansing . 
  as i said above , it should be noted that there is a fine line between being targeted because of ethnicity or religion , as they are often the same . 
  as long as a group is offered conversion as an option i do n't consider it genocide or ethnic cleansing . 
  it 's the difference between what happened to jews in spain around 1500 and what happened to the jews under european axis ' rule . 
  for the latter there was no escape . 
   millions of native americans that were slaughtered by european colonialists part of that was genocide . 
  the main ` american holocaust ' ( up to 90 % of the native population dying of disease ) was n't . 
  but the us quite deliberately committed ethnic cleansing and genocide later on . 
   the millions of congolese that died during belgian administration or the millions of south asians that died from famine under the british empire were n't victims of genocide . 
  indeed , they were victims of greed . 
  i 'm not some xenophobe from volendam , i know what i 'm talking about . 
  my best friend had turned into a guy who blames victims , shields his eyes when he sees women without head scarves and who spoke about his future wife and daughters as if they were his possessions . 
  and he is turkish , they 're fairly moderate . 
  i 've seen the utter conviction with which they will spout any kind of nonsense , from the armenian genocide not happening to turkey being able to beat israel in a war . 
  just like others perpetuate antisemitic myths . 
  most muslims are perfectly harmless , but when it comes to certain topics they are incapable of dealing with criticism like in a way that we would consider normal . 
  and that * is * a problem . 
  just like it 's a problem that we pretend we did n't support bombing , invasion and/or occupation of multiple muslim countries in the past 13 years that lead to the deaths of over a million people and ruined many more lives . 
  and that we report on every journalist or child killed by the is , but barely seem to care if israel kills over a dozen journalists and 500 children in a couple of weeks . 
  and , of course , the whole mohammed thing is silly . 
  he married an older woman for her money , raped a 9 year-old girl , terrorised mecca by raiding caravans and ordered/enabled the beheading of hundreds of jews . 
  of course we have every right to ridicule him and anyone who worships him like the ` perfect man ' . 
  thanks but i 'm not sure what to think of that because my recent comments were about taylor swift songs , metallica albums and r. kelly 's sex tape . 
  that 's cute . 
  did you grow up as a minority among muslims ?
