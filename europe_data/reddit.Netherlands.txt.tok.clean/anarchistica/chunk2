  malta kinda reminds me of the fifth element . 
  i like how our tweede kamer looks functional and spaceous , instead of the cramped/cosy hangouts other countries have . 
  it looks like a place where people work instead of romania 's looks like a huge villa of some banana republic dictator . 
  slovakia 's parliament is ugly , but i like the full circle setup and the windows . 
  the house of lords makes me laugh with its dreadful megathrone . 
  both it and the house of commons are terrible designs , they should move to something more practical . 
  hungary and the uk look nice on the outside , but too much like a cathedral . 
  denmark too with the clocktower . 
  not even . 
  just five countries . 
  the northern revolt actually aided the jews who also revolted at the time , and apparently both sides were aware of each others existence . 
  without looking at the others , i 'm pretty sure ours is the worst one . 
  it 's just some old house which has been turned into something barely representing a museum . 
  we got a tour from our uni teacher who works there and i still thought it was boring . 
  even the slavery museum had a larger exhibition . 
   but the morbid obsession with ** the only democracy in the middle east ** , they say & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;  `` saying that jews are the only nation who do n't have the right to self-determination ( ... ) is unmistakably anti-semitism . '' lol , yeah , because that \u00b4 s our point . 
  israel has killed almost 1200 people in retalliation for the murder of 3 . 
   `` jihadism has become the new nazism . 
  this makes people consider leaving france . '' because the nazis mostly killed other fascists ... ? 
   muslims are over-represented among the perpetrators of anti-semitic incidents , says gardener . 
  `` it is not as extreme as france , belgium , ** holland ** or malmo , where the levels of anti-semitism make life difficult for jews erm , why are we on this list ? 
  we had a peaceful protest last sunday . 
  no murders , no riots . 
  much smaller population & gdp : * germany - 81 | 3,3 * uk - 64 | 2,5 * france - 64 | 2,3 * italy - 61 | 1,8 * spain - 47 | 1,4 * poland - 38 | 0,8, 
  [ this is the real twitter of netanhayu . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/israelipm ) `` pm : instead of building kindergartens in gaza , hamas builds tunnels to blow up our kindergartens and murder children '' israel has repeatedly bombed schools and killed over 300 children during cast lead alone . 
  hey , if it worked for them , why would n't it work for muslims ? 
  but en and nl are germanic languages . 
  just look at how fr deviates when counting to ten ( en | nl | de | fr ) : * one | een | ein | un * two | twee | zwei | ** deux ** * three | drie | drei | throis * four | vier | vier | ** quatre ** * five | vijf | f\u00fcnf | ** cinq ** * six | zes | sechs | six * seven | zeven | sieben | sept * eight | acht | acht | ** huit ** * nine | negen | neun | neuf * ten | tien | zehn | ** dix ** and that 's even without the crazy stuff like them saying `` 4-20 '' when they mean `` 80 '' . 
  being unable to pronounce ` ij ' , ` eu ' , ` ui ' and such seems minor in comparison . 
   french is easier , just saying . 
  english is more similar to nl than to fr . 
  this is the conclusion of the extensive research done by a special committee . 
  dutchbat was to be a policing force , the french would provide air support if anything went wrong . 
  they did n't because of french hostages . 
   they did shit , absolute bugger all . 
  they were outnumbered , outgunned and so low on resources that they had to patrol on foot . 
  the french withheld the promised air support , they are to blame for the failure to protect the enclave . 
  i do n't think you can judge spanish antifa 's based on what antifa 's elsewhere do . 
  high gas prices : * more tax money . 
  * less pollution  better health . 
  * less non-business traffic  better for economy . 
  * less non-professional drivers  fewer traffic deaths . 
  win-win . 
  you 're not the brightest crayon in the box , are you ? 
  because those were antifa 's ? 
  indeed , we should banish the conservative and liberal factions . 
  and you judge people on the other side of the planet based on that ? 
  let 's not forget that oz is n't exactly innocent when it comes to issues of race , either . 
  so , how many jews , romani and slavs did we kill exactly ? 
  i 've been calculating the crime rates between the us and nl and the rate has been fairly stable . 
  murder declined a bit from 4,5 to 4,3 , rape is almost unchanged , incarceration increased . 
  clearly you do n't live here . 
  yes , i live in what was deemed the worst neighbourhood in nl ( in 2007 ) . 
  we even had a full-on mob hit 1,5 years ago in amsterdam west - with kalasjnikovs and everything . 
  multiple people have been shot this year , including someone who was killed while holding his two children . 
  lucky bastards . 
  i live in the ghetto and i still have to hear adult men shout `` yes , yes ! '', 
  because some millionaires beat some other millionaires . 
  they 're also very war-on-drugs-ish . 
  who said anything about belgian army officers ? 
  `` a number of other belgian officers and non-commissioned officers were also dispatched to the territory as the nucleus of the officer corps . 
  the officers of the force publique were entirely european . 
  they comprised a mixture of belgian regular soldiers and mercenaries from other countries who were drawn by the prospect of wealth or simply attracted to the adventure of service in africa . '', 
  yeah , it 's not like you made him your king and he used belgian troops . 
  he was nuts , he wanted to invade us too . 
  the number of deaths in nl-indi\u00eb was less than a quarter of a million , on a population of 80 million . 
  the population of kongo-vrijstaat went from 20 to 8 million due to people fleeing or dying . 
  had the same on the first thing , but the other one was : 1 . 
  english 2 . 
  norwegian 3 . 
  dutch, 
  dutch east indies * also , it did n't exactly start in 1947 but way back in 1603 . 
  heck , even in the previous century we had fought the aceh war ( which ended in 1914 ) . 
  we still have stuff dedicated to war criminal jan pieterszoon coen - my commute takes me past the coen building which has the text `` coen is king '' . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; but hey , at least we 're not the belgians . 
  the standard used here may be relatively high . 
  also , i know young people at mbo level who have a poor understanding of english . 
  of course , there is also a large group for whom english is a third language . 
  turks , moroccans , etc. 
  their grasp of it is below average . 
  [ the telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/switzerland/10846730/nazi-salute-not-always-punishable-as-racial-discrimination-swiss-court-rules.html ), 
  i 'd argue that the pvdd is more left-wing as the sp is ` for ' economic growth . 
  in 1998 a [ transsexual ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dana_international ) won even ... 
  no , what would be their motive to attack the rest of nato ? 
  let 's assume they have the means ... what would be their motive ? 
  get their hands on the house peter the great stayed in back in the day ? 
  which is weird since we call birds ' mouths `` snavel '' . 
  really wonder what happened there . 
  enemies the us makes for us , duh . 
  seriously , we 've got multiple nuclear powers and a vastly larger and more modern military than russia . 
  also , the russian military is kind of a joke . 
  during the invasion of georgia half of their equipment broke down . 
  christ , i saw footage of their huge training exercise and their tanks ca n't even maintain echelon formation . 
  even if they did , citations have their own problems . 
  you are encouraged to publish a lot , quantity over quality . 
  this is in line with other liberal attempts to turn academics into another form of ` production ' ( e.g. , valorisation ) . 
  yeah , these rankings and indeed most academic rankings are a bunch of nonsense . 
  take the the for instance . 
  their ratings are based fo 30 % on citations .
