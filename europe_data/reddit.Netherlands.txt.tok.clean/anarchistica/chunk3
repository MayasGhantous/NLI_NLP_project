  do you know who get cited a lot ? 
  people who write in english . 
  do you know who they themselves cite ? 
  yeah , other people who write in english . 
  who would 've guessed that the home of the langua franca does best ... 
  this is also the reason smaller countries do so well . 
  they tend to write stuff in english because their home audience is n't very large . 
  on top of that comes the insane anti-scientific obsession with publishing . 
  do you know what counts ? 
  yeah , the * amount * . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; ( i attended 2 universities listed ), 
  * ** gedoogakkoord ** : when a political party supports the ruling party/coalition without officially being a part of it . 
  * ** poldermodel ** : establishing policy through deliberation . 
  this was at the top of the front page a few days ago - in non-blogspam form too . 
  we remember what happened last time when we kept our country dark , so now we want to be sure you dumbasses do n't fucking bomb the shit out of us again . 
  :d ( casualties from allied bombing were 10 times as high as from axis bombing ), 
  kind of ironic that you should say this as you and jihadists are famous for chopping off heads . 
  i wonder why so many women die of cancer here . 
  smoking ? 
  [ ** a european union investigation concluded that georgia had started the `` unjustified '' war ** , but that this was a `` mere culmination of a series of provocations '' . 
  it also concluded that russia did have the right to intervene in cases of attacks against russian peacekeepers , but that the further russian advance into `` georgia proper '' had been disproportionate . 
  the commission found that all parties involved in the conflict had violated international law .

  not really . 
  russia spends only 50 % more on the military than the uk . 
  the uk and france together spend 33 % more . 
  both sides have an equal amount of modern mbts ( ~ 800 ) . 
  russia has 2,5 times as many fighter jets , but if it would get that far ... 
  a webcam is like a window . 
  not turning it away from you or covering it is like not closing the curtain on a window . 
  serious question : were you completely unfamiliar with the concept of hacking computers ? 
  i clarified my post for tards . 
  this sounds like a bunch of liberal nonsense . 
  you know , the whole `` minimum wage kills jobs '' thing . 
  no , aldi shuts down stores if people try to unionise and they also work hard to keep unions out of their distribution centers . 
  because you ca n't demand more if you have a minimum ? 
  yes , i said $ instead of $ . 
  over here aldi pays shit and requires middle management to work 55-60 hours . 
   aldi pays better wages than the rest of the supermarket industry . 
  never heard that before . 
   if you want to criticise them , stick to the facts . 
  these are the facts here . 
  lol . 
  the eu spends more on the military than russia and china combined . 
  norway , sweden and greece each spend about as much as iran . 
  the eu has two nuclear powers and its military hardware is far superior to any `` rogue state '' . 
  not surprising , since de does n't have a minimum wage and is home of lidl and aldi . 
  especially the latter is bad , its employees make minimum wage here while karl albrecht is worth $ 25.000.000.000 + . 
  now now , let 's not insult the neandertals . 
  rotterdam was bombed by accident , actually . 
  there was a miscommunication , and the city was bombed despite our surrendering . 
  yeah , especially of the ukranians . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutionary_insurrectionary_army_of_ukraine, 
  like in 1652 , 1665 , 1672 and 1781 . :p, 
  no , this came up during a uni course ( holocaust & genocide ) . 
   getting one from scratch could be much faster though , but i ca n't remember . 
  two weeks for me . 
   that is literally the only difference . 
  not really . 
  cows are normally killed by a pin through the brain . 
  chickens are decapitated by a machine . 
  perhaps not in your circles . 
  lmao . 
  what 's next , liberals are leftist ? 
  i am dictatorial how exactly ? 
  and a communist how exactly ? 
  and lol @ us definition . 
  yes , discrimination based on inherited traits . 
  the otherwise nonsensical word `` racism '' has been reappropriated to mean that . 
   dictatorial communist . 
  maybe you should google those words ...  also , when did being opposed to lgbtq rights racist ? 
  you can obviously call them homophobic etc but where to get racist from , or does it just emerge from you apparent lack of sanity ? 
  the modern definition of racism extends to more than just ethnicity . 
  from another article :  the arguments against the lunacek report have been widely discussed . 
  tens of thousands of citizens and many civil society organisations , accompanied by some meps , had expressed their concern that such a road-map aims at creating special `` lgbti rights '' -- and not at protecting the same human rights for all . 
  ** as a consequence , a certain lifestyle , which is and will remain that of a tiny minority , will enjoy special protection in every respect . 
  this puts freedom of speech , of conscience , of religion , and parental rights themselves at great risk . 
  ** in the lunacek report , the very concept of human rights as the universal recognition of the rights flowing from the inherent human dignity of each and every person has been abandoned . 
  and another article :  the campaign was yet another manifestation of the great displeasure of thousands of citizens about the controversial estrela report on sexual and reproductive health and rights that will be voted today at 12:45 . 
   ** the content of the report promotes radical claims , such as a `` right to abortion '' ** , the retrenchment of parental rights , and serious limitations on freedom of conscience the third article i checked :  croatia opened its ballot boxes on sunday -- and citizens across the country demonstrated broad consensus on a crucial and fundamental question facing society : ** should society entirely give up on the natural marriage as the cornerstone of civilization , re-define marriage as the union of any two adults , regardless of gender , and thus slip away into total arbitrariness ? 
  or should marriage remain what it has always meant -- a lifelong union between a woman and a man ? 
  ** yeah , please fuck off and die pathic racist conservatives . 
  we have a reformed fringe who champion fairy tales , they come up with nonsense like [ this ] ( http://www.refdag.nl/nieuws/binnenland/de_oude_wereld_nieuwe_biologiemethode_nu_al_achterhaald_1_803307 ) ( `` they claim dinosaurs died 65 mln years ago , but they do n't tell us why . '' ) . 
  in 2005 there was a fuss about `` intelligent design '' and our [ minister of education ( a christian-democrat ) ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/maria_van_der_hoeven ) said she liked the idea of having it in schools . 
  after everyone was done laughing she was trampled by criticism and quickly withdrew her proposal . 
  little known fact : we have a nearly 900m high mountain . 
  wales only has two higher ones . 
   no , i do n't . 
  maybe read the papers ? 
   why should they ? 
  so you 're saying they * are * all about making $ $ $ ? 
   i want that everybody has a fair chance of making a good life for him/herself . 
  i simply want everyone to have a good life . 
   inequality is a natural and inescapable thing the one thing inequality is n't , is natural and inescapable . 
  it 's this pseudo-defeatist attitude that fuels right-wing stupidity . 
  the plain and simple answer is money . 
  the trade networks of jews were highly valuable , and sometimes they even contributed directly to republican causes - the conquest of england was partially funded by a wealthy jew they had kicked out . 
  even spain tolerated and praised a handful of jews because they bailed them out with money . 
  so why were jews allowed to practice in the open while catholics and non-state church protestants were n't ? 
   what are you talking about ?
