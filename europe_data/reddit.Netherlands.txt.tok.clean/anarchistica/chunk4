  you know , their actual policies and voting history ? 
   the whole point of liberal democracy is self actualization . 
  let people make their own money by empowering them through education and universal rights and freedom of religion . 
  yeah , and everyone benefits from that equally . 
   because guess what , growing your economy is the best way to fix private debt . 
  or you could , like , not spend money you do n't have . 
   what , how much higher ? 
  what countries ? 
  where does this come from ? 
  in the uk , for instance , only 11 people have been killed by police in this millennium . 
   are you joking ? 
  in the country with the highest incarceration rate in the world ? 
  i said they have more rights , their incarceration rate is irrelevant . 
   actually they have been falling for good 5 years by now [ 1 ] . 
  you are making a contradiction here . 
  you do realise that `` rose '' is past tense ( verleden tijd ) , right ? 
   i 'm renting a flat from a corporation in the middle of the city for 320e/month utilities excluded . 
  i do n't think lutjebroek counts . 
  not to mention that your money and the tax money those subsidies come from go to managers who make at least 3 times the modal wage . 
   yeah , it would be much better if all these poor sods stuck with the mortgages they can barely keep paying had to take second mortgages just to pay off the interest , right ? 
  yeah , because that was my point . 
  yes , and who was tolerated and who was n't ? 
  ** nederland / the netherlands ** there are many things wrong with this country , i 'll try to keep it brief . 
  ** right-wing has won ** there are eleven parties in parliament . 
  only two of those are actually left-wing . 
  only one of them does not see economic growth as a necessity . 
  we 've got five right-wing parties and four centrist parties who love helping the right-wing get what they want . 
  this is why we 're a tax haven , why all but one of our banks had to be bailed out and why `` austerity '' is only something the weaker groups have to face . 
  ** justicy system is derailed ** in recent years , police have killed a whole bunch of unarmed people without facing any consequences . 
  unarmed people have been shot in the back and no one blinks an eye . 
  the number of people killed by police is much higher than in surrounding countries . 
  on the other hand of the spectrum , the police engages in racial profiling and arrests activists without probable cause . 
  they also casually lie about being assaulted , and judges go along with it . 
  especially plainclothes police have gone insane , as a few scottish football fans can attest to . 
  on top of that , there have been many high-profile cases of innocent people sentenced due to mistakes made by their accusers . 
  freedom of speech has come under assault too , the police have even complained about the way a cop acts on a tv show . 
  if you get arrested in the us , you have more rights than you do here . 
  ** imprisonment of migrants ** we lock up people because they do n't have a eu passport . 
  including their children . 
  it does n't matter if you 've lived here for decades , speak the language and have had children here . 
  the system is truly demented . 
  sometimes people get sent back to dangerous countries ( some of them have been killed on returning ) . 
  and if you do n't get sent back , they will simply throw you to the street . 
  you ca n't get a job and have no way to get food or housing legally . 
  sometimes you end up in a migrant prison again , only for the whole thing to repeat itself . 
  sometimes people get so desperate that they commit suicide . 
  ** housing shortage & villa subsidies ** we 've had a housing shortage since world war 2 . 
  it seems pretty simple to build houses , right ? 
  you know what the government is doing instead ? 
  subsidising private companies to destroy the offices they built with subsidies . 
  they also build megalomanic city halls and do insanely expensive renovations of city centers . 
  they even built a waterfall in my old hometown . 
  and when houses do get built , they 're often expensive . 
  we 're experiencing the after-effects of the housing bubble . 
  housing prices kept rising , mortages rose in accordance , people could take a second mortage and spend this money - since housing prices always rose . 
  we 've got insane private debt , and banks who sold these mortages through financial advisors that got a percentage had to be bailed out and complain that people did it to themselves . 
  and if you rent you 're fucked too since rentals were privatised and those corporations need big offices and high wages for the ceos . 
  oh , and those villa subsidies ? 
  we 've had something called mortage interest deductibility since the early 1900s . 
  an amount of interest on your mortage was tax deductible based on ... the value of the home . 
  about half of the benefits go to the wealthiest 10 % . 
  liberalism has always been business first , rights second . 
  just look at religious tolerance in the republic or the early history of the us . 
  d66 are liberal-democrats , there 's a difference . 
  they 're more progressive , but they 're often fine with supporting the rest of the right-wing if it helps them get $ $ $ . 
   the vvd is a supposedly `` liberal '' party but the only thing they 're liberal about is the economy . 
  that 's what liberal means in a political context . 
  the only reason for liberal parties to act either progressively or conservatively is if it suits them . 
  it 's even worse than . 
  all the other countries have a translation of nee ( hay\u00efr , nie ) . 
  it mistranslates * no * ... well , in fr and nl , most other languages are correct . 
  haha , there 's a guy i have n't seen in a decade or so and i still remember he owes me : * pulp fiction on vcr * black knight from 5th edition ( magic the gathering card ) * imperial armor from weatherlight ( magic the gathering card ) and a friend of mine still owes me a beer for the time i bailed him out in high school , ~ 15 years ago . 
  you 're welcome . 
  it might be because we can understand poor translations from certain languages ( fr , de , etc ) reasonably well . 
  i 'm 99 % sure that 's not a real name . 
  xander is just short for alexander . 
  and pimmeh ... for real ? 
  mostly i think people should n't be punished because they * might * do something in another country . 
  imagine if any single male travelling to thailand was automatically branded a pedosexual . 
  because we bomb muslims by the thousands ? 
  this is typical cowardly bullshit from the pvv and the right . 
  `` omg terrorists lol ! '', 
  saffie and vaantje are first names . 
  vaantje is short for ginovanni . 
  even our cities have [ weird names ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexbierum ) . 
   to mention orwell and hemmingway in the same breath with the fascist cut-throats of isis and al nusra is cringeworthy . 
  maybe they join the fsa instead ? 
  i have colleagues called `` saffie '' and `` vaantje '' , i love those names . 
  do you guys have weird last names like naaktgeboren , zeldenthuis , sukkel , etc ? 
  weird , i thought it was a seperate fee here but apparently they just raised the lowest tax bracket ( $ 0-20 .000 ) by 1,1 % in 2000 . 
  i ca n't believe i 'm paying for football , lingo and , ugh , van nieuwkerk . 
  i 'd rather have that $ 200 + . 
  so you think orwell and hemmingway should have been punished for fighting fascists in spain ? 
  google also always asks me if if want to use my youtube name * anarchistica * or my google name * anarchistica * ... 
  the french refused air support because of french hostages ? 
  stroop is his last name though . 
  done . 
  the article seems a lot longer when posted here . 
  proper translation . 
  note that i 've updated it about 2-3 hours after creation .
