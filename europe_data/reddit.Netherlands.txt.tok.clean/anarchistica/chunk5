  _____ ** mark stroop [ oo as in roosevelt ] , who runs a car rental business in ijsselstein , is n't scared easily . 
  when two of his cars were stolen and taken to iraqi kurdistan , he went to retrieve them himself . 
  it turned into a bizarre journey that ended with a tough negotiation about the release of the thief of his cars . 
  ** they 're there in the hall behind his house : the black opel cascada and a silver-grey volkswagen golf . 
  both convertibles . 
  maybe not the most interesting cars in stroops inventory , but certainly the best story . 
  ** `` i rented them to jihadis '' ** because how bizarre was it late september , when stroop saw the cars rented by a sherzad and mehmed , drive towards the middle east through his built-in track & trace system . 
  `` sometimes i watch where my cars are driving on my computer so i see those cars enter turkey !, 
  while they had to be returned the next day . 
  i immediately knew : here comes trouble . 
  and they even headed towards syria . 
  i thought : my god , i rented them to jihadis . '', 
  there was n't a lot stroop could do . 
  formally the cars were n't stolen yet . 
  at night stroop saw the cars drive along the syrian border towards iraq . 
  an attempt to stop them at the border through the dutch embassy came to late . 
  but : the track & trace system still worked . 
  in the cities of duhok and sersink stroop saw the long journey of his cars end . 
  in iraq . 
  but stroop had a problem : rental cars that are n't returned are not insured . 
  this would set back stroops - otherwise stable - business silverline $ 75.000 , which he could n't afford . 
  `` i had to get those cars back . '', 
  ** kalashnikov ** in his search for a good companion stroop happened upon a ` mister saman ' , a kurdish dutchman who works for the local police and is helping establish a police union according to western standards in iraqi kurdistan . 
  `` he was willing to come along '' , says stroop , who arranged for a car through an acquaintance of saman when they arrived in the city of arbil . 
  `` and that acquaintance casually threw a kalashnikov on the back-seat '' , says stroop . 
  `` he thought it was important , they * had * to bring it . 
  that really made clear where we were . '', 
  through saman , stroop quickly met one of the top police chiefs in northern iraq . 
  `` they had never seen that before , a dutchman who came to look for his stolen cars . 
  perhaps that 's why they were willing to help . '', 
  in the meantime however , the thieves had removed the track & trace system from the cars . 
  they really needed the police to help them , but it took three whole days of stroop collecting stamp after stamp : from the iraqi minister of internal affairs to the court and from the local police to interpol . 
  all of iraqi kurdistan was looking for the convertibles from ijsselstein . 
  on the way home stroop received a telephone call : the cars and the thieves had been found . 
  stroop was relieved , but the bureaucratic battle had yet to begin : a truckload of iraqi authorities had to get translated and signed documents that proved mark stroop was the lawful owner of the convertibles they had tracked down . 
  when stroop , along with his friends jos and jolle , finally was allowed to retrieve his cars in duhok in november , the scariest moment had yet to come . 
  ** police ** because suddenly a captain of the military police showed up : a full cousin of sherzad , the ` brains ' behind the operation . 
  it quickly became clear what the captain wanted : he was free to take the cars , but would stroop be willing to drop the charges against nephew sherzad so he would n't have to spend years in jail ? 
  `` it turned out sherzad would get a 15-year sentence . 
  i explained to them i spent $ 10.000 to retrieve the cars . 
  after a long negotiation they were willing to pay 7000 . 
  when i finally agreed to that , because i wanted to leave in one piece , the atmosphere changed completely and they even offered me lunch . '', 
  the journey home was 4500 km . 
  now they 're back , in the hall in ijsselstein , between some much nicer cars . 
  `` after this adventure these really are my babies '' , stroop jokes . 
  _____ done . 
  that takes surprisingly long . 
  edit : thanks for the gold , stranger !, 
  in your honour i 've actually gone over the translation a second time and made a bunch of corrections and improvements . 
  jerom is called wilbur in english , who knows what 's going on with that language . 
  it 's so schlecht it 's gut . 
  in other words , no decent music has come out of de since the early 90s ? 
  :p also , you linked to the wrong lacrimosa ... haha . 
  :d and i prefer [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oas5nalfrwg ) for nena . 
   you can make that face , but those were your words . 
  notice the quotation marks i used ? 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;  yeah , when subtitled . 
   talk in whatever language they want en dat zeg ik waar precies ? 
   because you do n't like being in the same store with them . 
   do you think anarchists need a course in political science ? 
   * legislate taste * no , people should be free to watch whatever they want . 
  the subs will help them learn nl . 
   your prejudice lol , you mean my experience , right ? 
  i 've lived in gettos for 23 years . 
  my primary school was 95 non-nl . 
  at least half of my colleagues are too . 
  and i love it . 
  the only thing i hate is people not learning nl or speaking turkish/etc . 
  with each other during lunch . 
   they should get therapy , they 're lazy , they 're rude & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
   fines for their wives wearing headscarfs ? 
  no , i said ninjas . 
  fines for wearing a burqa , niqaab or abaya . 
   how do you know the husbands are the ones responsible for the women wearing headscarfs ? 
  that 's irrelevant , you have to provide an incentive to get rid of it . 
   how about single muslim women ? 
  how about muslim girls ? 
  for underage women you can fine the parents . 
  single adult women dressed as ninjas really should just get psychological therapy . 
   why not fine male jews for wearing little hats ( yamulkas ) ? 
  why would n't you fine leather jackets ? 
  why not fine fur coats ? 
  because those are n't inherently unhealthy , nor do they prevent basic human contact . 
   ca n't make people do a language test when they 've got a dutch passport . 
  this should be an option . 
   how would you feel if the government singled out all gay or black people for a language test at age 65 ? 
  yeah , because being lazy and anti-social makes you gay or black . 
   you would spend tax payer money to translate every single satellite channel 24/7 who said anything about taxpayer money ? 
  the related companies would be responsible for this . 
  do n't underestimate the severity of the mistake they made getting rid of that turkish tv channel . 
   just because you do n't like standing in a store with muslimas ? 
  no , because there are children whose * grandparents * were born here who still learn turkish instead of nl , almost automatically making them a segregated minority . 
  we could also try making these people understand it is beyond incredibly rude to speak a language most people do n't understand at work , in the supermarket or elsewhere . 
  they should call it `` you 're not a fucking tourist . '', 
  or something like that . 
  fines for ninjas ' husbands , accessible language classes , hardcoded subs on all foreign language channels . 
   still manage to blissfully ignore the equally blatant sexism of the zwarte-kousen my first post : `` some insane , racist , incest-fetishist mass-murdering deity . '', 
  l2r . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;  besides , in my view , the gravest societal problems linked to `` allochtonous youths '' have less to do with religion than with the drug trade . 
   but again , is islam itself the problem there , or conservative-minded assholes ?
