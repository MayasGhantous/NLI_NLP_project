  :p like , is the concept of catholicism to blame for the child molestation scandals ? 
  these religions created a culture that enables certain attitudes and behaviour . 
   what , more so than all the other parties ? 
  are you sure that 's an accusation you want to level at the pvda ? 
  the pvda has laboured to legalise euthanasia , prostitution and same-sex marriage . 
  but they 've never done anything to further the cause of the women of the people who vote for them ( especially turks still stick to labout because of drees ) . 
   do n't do that eye-shit , those are problem parts , definitely . 
  he ignored 90 % of my post . 
   but is islam really the only or the major factor creating those problems ? 
  other factors causing the discrimination of women ( and certain other minorities ) are minor compared to it . 
  you might also not realise how influential mosques are and how the foster an attitude of segregation . 
  i used to be best friends with the son of the local imam , who was comparatively progressive . 
  because of that , his superiors sent him to some shitty oxcart village in turkey and replaced him with someone more `` fitting '' . 
  considering that his son , my former best friend , would later shield his eyes when he saw women without head towels , that says quite a bit about turkish attitudes . 
   and pvda has nothing to do with this . 
  they 've enabled getto-isation for decades . 
   and in the next sentence you call them ninjas . 
  i 'm sure a lack of empathy makes things nicer for them . 
  ninja is an insult now ? 
  here is the part of my post that you skipped in your answer , just in case you have some quaint form of dyslexia :  the only people who think islam is n't a problem are ignorant men . 
  i would invite you to leave the platteland and visit a `` kracht/pracht/vogelaar wijk '' for a change . 
  look at all the fat , unhappy women wearing hand towels who barely have any agency . 
  feel what it 's like to stand in between a bunch of ninjas at the freaking blokker . 
   islam is a real problem , like any other retarded ideology that encourages discrimination and oppression - regardless of whether this is in the name of capitalism , fascism , or some insane , racist , incest-fetishist mass-murdering deity . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; edit : you vote pvda , do n't you ?

  trying pretending to be a vulnerable group that is acceptable to discriminate ( gay/jewish ) .

  i think jeff was being sarcastic . 
  at least , i hope so . 
  er , you might want to look up switzerland on a map . 
   half our country is below sea level 26 % is below nap . 
  us/nl exchange . 
  besides , vk is european paper of the year , makes sense other papers might borrow stuff . 
  it did prove in 2004 that 59 million usicans really should n't be allowed to vote . 
  vk always has garbage by that friedman dude so it kinda makes sense . 
  number one on one website ? 
  `` often considered best in the world '' . 
  fortuyn was n't . 
  it is n't a legal matter , i was just showing you that even the un uses the same definition . 
  feel free to ask / r/askhistorians what they think . 
   still i am a lawyer , so anything but a layman . 
  you 're not a historian , that makes you a layman . 
  that is not how law works that is simply irrelevant to historians .

   sinterklaas , and his * slave * , black pete . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;  through it all , dutch jews -- some of whom celebrate their own version of the black pete custom , called `` hanukklaas '' -- have largely remained silent . 
  i , nor the internet , had ever heard of this before this article . 
   but in holland , the issue of jewish complicity is rarely discussed . 
  this is probably mostly due to that we do n't really see `` jews '' as a separate group . 
  also , they did n't form a single group . 
  obviously , sephardic jews were much more involved in slave trade than the far less wealthy ashkenazi jews who came here later on . 
  and even where the latter were involved , it may not have been by choice . 
  the sephardic jews shipped a couple hundred poor ashkenazi jews to our latin american colonies so they would n't be a further `` burden '' and `` embarassment '' to them . 
  google it , it seems to have been made up . 
   i 've been arguing that leopold ii . 
  's congo thing was genocide against the opinion that it was just mass murder for profit and you actually ask me that question ?? 
  seriously ? 
  i do apologise for tricking you , but since you 're so obviously a layman i felt it was needed to get to the crux of the matter . 
  the term ` genocide ' is quite loaded , like the term ` terrorism ' . 
  it is quite common for laymen such as yourself to mistake the term ` genocide ' for a quantifier of the severity of a crime . 
  it is not . 
  genocide has a very specific definition and is used for very specific instances of mass-murder . 
  it is n't `` worse '' than mass-murder , it 's simply different . 
  the british have repeatedly starved tens of millions of indians , as late as ww2 . 
  this is one of the worst crimes in history , pretty much the reason why i consider them the worst people in history . 
  however , they did not intend to destroy the indian people , so it is n't genocide . 
  the intentions of separate groups or individuals acting under a regime which is committing genocide are irrelevant . 
  the kurds were most likely looking to gain land and gain legitimacy , but that does not mean the armenian holocaust was n't genocide . 
  the osman empire was determined to do away with pretty much any non-muslims , which makes it genocide . 
  i consider leopold ii to be the most evil person in history , surpassing stalin , hitler , mao , an lushan , and genghis khan and his successors . 
  he was responsible for the flight and death of as many as 12 million people , for turning villages on each other and for turning chopped-off hands into a currency . 
  however , he was out for profit , not for the destruction of the people in his private possession kongo vrijstaat . 
  thus , it was not genocide . 
   mass-murder for profit is not genocide ? 
  so the jews gassed in auschwitz are genocide victims ( as long as they were poor ) but the jews worked to death for ig farben and all the other german companies or the rich jews that got their property stolen were not . 
  no , it is n't . 
  the goal was n't to profit from jews , that was just a convenient way to get rid of them . 
   that 's the result of your definition . 
  feel free to tell her how wrong she is about genocide . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; and , of course , [ the un defined genocide ] ( http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/cppcg/cppcg.html ) as follows : * acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group * so , also feel free to tell the un how wrong they are . 
  _____ by the way , about my original point : * u/tetradax said : `` germany is a great nation with a great history , and just because of 12 years nobody ca n't show it anymore ? '', 
  * i replied : `` not like the germans commited any other genocides in the first half of the 20th century ... '' you agree with him that it 's just the years under hitler were bad and that it 's ok if you commit genocide against black people ? 
  and you do n't think the hutus and tutsis bear any blame ? 
  rwanda became independent in the early 60s , why did it take 30 + years if the belgians are solely to blame ? 
   what about the serbs ? 
  srebrenica anyone ? 
  i limited my answer to 1800-1950 and european nations . 
   if that is not genocide , then i do n't know what is . 
  obviously you do n't . 
  genocide , from gens [ family ] and cidere [ killing ] , refers to acts that are meant to destroy in whole or in part a ( perceived ) ethnic group . 
  usually this group is made out to be a pest , a threat or both . 
  mass-murder for profit like the belgians did in kongo vrijstaat and the british in british india is n't genocide . 
  the goal was not to destroy a specific ethnic group . 
  examples of victims of genocide : * native peoples in canada , australia and the united states . 
  * circassians in the russian empire . 
  * herero and nama in deutsch-westafrika .
