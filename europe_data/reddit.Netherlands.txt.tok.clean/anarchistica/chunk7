  * armenians , assyrians and greeks in the ottoman empire . 
  * ukranians in the cccp . 
  * jews and romani in the gro\u00dfdeutsches reich . 
  * serbs in the independent state of croatia . 
  * bosnians in bosnia and herzegovina . 
  no , the hutu/tutsi divide predates the belgians . 
  the germans had basically the same system too ( germany lost rwanda to belgium after ww1 ) . 
  the hutus and tutsis were n't `` bound '' to mass-murder each other , they did have agency . 
  and even if you 're gon na blame outside factors , how about the french and the us ? 
  yeah , not like they had been gone for 30 years ... oh wait ... & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  the indians i already mentioned ( english ) . 
  the mexica ( `` aztecs '' ) were n't victims of genocide in this time period for as far as i know . 
  i already edited in the turks , who also targetted other groups ( greeks , assyrians , etc. ) . 
  i 've limited it to european nations , though there are few others who 've commited genocide . 
  the germans killed 35 % of all jews , hundreds of thousands of romani , as well as 50-90 % of the nama and herero peoples . 
  belgium did n't commit genocide . 
  nor did we . 
  nor did most countries . 
  only the germans , turks , russians , croats and the english did . 
  piracy . 
  this was struck down by the international sea court or something . 
   question : what are unclassified transactions ? 
  ( netherlands ) weapons . 
  we 're one of the top exporters . 
  not like the germans commited any other genocides in the first half of the 20th century ... & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; edit : apparently , seven people do n't mind if you just kill black people . 
  no , there are n't . 
  fine , you 're on your own in the next northern war . 
  you could just add `` other '' as an option . 
   right wing propaganda why would conservatives censor their own propaganda ? 
  only two genders ? 
  of course . 
  i did n't think of the financial aspect . 
  perhaps , or we do well in pisa for some other reason ( high iq , linguistic similarity to english ) . 
  europa : danmark , the only ` neighbour ' we have n't really fought plus we can share bike strategies . 
  i 'd rather see most of limburg returned to belgi\u00eb though , on the condition that they take venlo . 
  world : uruguay , they 're becoming more progressive than us and i 'd much rather have mujica as pm . 
  considering that we only deployed tanks to nederlands-indi\u00eb and amsterdam , it seems we do n't need tanks to be likable . 
  lol . 
  the main problem is that , well , we do n't really need an air superiority fighter . 
  who are we gon na use it against , the taliban air force ? 
  we only got those tanks to slow down the soviets in west-de , they 're pointless now . 
  besides , they were only ever used against our own citizens , i 'm glad they 're gone . 
  yeah , that 's why we sent them there . 
  oh wait ... apache 's and mobile artillery are more than enough . 
  second most worried about education and we just scored top 3 in some pisa rankings . 
  weird that so many people are worried about inflation , i guess it 's not that big a deal over here . 
  yeah , russia and turkey are constantly apologising for their past , let alone georgia and austria . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; and it 's not like we still benefit from slavery , those bengali get $ 0,20 per hour !, 
  i guess we 're the odd ones because we have sinterklaas on the 5th ( belgians on the 6th ) . 
  it 's kind of amusing that greece of all countries has some weirdo bringing gifts , since sinterklaas/santa klaus/st . 
  nicholas was originally a greek . 
  there 's overlap all over the map . 
  5 , 25 and 26 december not enough for ya ? 
   goat set on fire on 23 december by lawrence jones , a 51-year-old visitor from cleveland , ohio , who spent 18 days in jail and was subsequently convicted and ordered to pay 100,000 swedish kronor in damages . 
  the court confiscated jones 's cigarette lighter with the argument that he clearly was not able to handle it . 
  jones stated in court that he was no `` goat burner '' , and believed that he was taking part in a completely legal goat-burning tradition . 
  after jones was released from jail he went straight back to the us without paying his fine . 
  as of 2006 it was still unpaid . 
  americans ... :p, 
  we have both , but de sint is still dominant . 
  and since we have two days of christmas that makes us three times better than everyone else . 
  ironically , the kurds helped the turks here . 
  kind of like a `` first they came for the commies '' situation . 
  interesting how so many names are the same , and then there are a bunch of really weird ones . 
  hoorvatia makes sense ( hrvatska ) but taani and rootsi ? 
  weird . 
   ( yes i know `` lingua franca '' means `` french '' do n't be a dick you know what i meant ) actually , it does n't . 
  the `` franca '' refers to all western europeans ( as named by ottomans and the like ) , the lingua was mostly italian . 
  safe *, 
  do n't forget about the herero and nama peoples , the nearly wiped out the latter . 
  this test only applies to 15 year-olds ( 3rd graders ) and mostly tests the more basic skills instead of knowledge . 
  also , we 've got the highest average iq among european countries , which is probably an important factor . 
  that 's why we call them a liberal party . 
  it was legal if the building had not been used in 6 months . 
  once the owner actually wanted to do something with it , you had to leave . 
  keep in mind that we 've had a housing shortage since ww2 ( ! ) . 
  also , lots of buildings were intentionally left empty - the owner was just waiting for the value of the property to increase . 
  with 3500 people per km \u00b2 , that is n't desirable . 
  between 1994 and 2002 the government legalised same-sex marriage , prostitution , limited euthanasia and squatting . 
  since then the governments have recriminalised certain drugs ( mushrooms ) , made squatting illegal , called for even harsher punishments , locked up refugees by the hundreds , and are currently looking to make it illegal to `` deeply offend '' someone 's religious beliefs . 
  the government has also expanded our already insane spying program , cracked down on peaceful activists ( especially republicans ) and is implementing ever more right-wing policies . 
  they 're even considering deep payment cuts for pro-deo advocacy . 
  it 's especially sad because labour is going along with all of this while pretending to be left-wing progressives . 
  uruguay legaised marijuana , germany adopts a third gender , belgium opens euthanasia to children , norway fights male genital mutilation . 
  we 're getting there , ever so slowly . 
  shame my country took a turn for the worse . 
  i wonder what effect this will have on youth unemployment . 
  we have [ separate minimum wages for people under 23 ] ( http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/minimumloon/vraag-en-antwoord/hoe-hoog-is-het-minimumloon.html ) , down to about $ 2,50 for a 15 year-old . 
  with adult minimum wage at $ 8,50 , kids often get shitty easy jobs in supermarkets and the like . 
   amsterdam pays alcoholics in beer ftfy . 
   ` these images normalise sexual violence against women so it 's ok if a guy is being raped ? 
   they are quite simply poisonous to the young people who see them . ' old people do n't see them ? 
  or it 's ok if they do , if so , are they getting punished too ? 
  dickless here just wants to control the internet to further his conservative , pro-corporate agenda . 
  this is an excuse to expand his powers . 
  duh , he 's a conservative . 
  [ they do the same thing here . 
  ] ( http://www.rtvnh.nl/nieuws/79221/me+in+actie+bij+1+mei-demonstratie+amsterdam ) even if you do comply with their ridiculous demands they 'll beat you up and charge you with assaulting a police officer all the same . 
  this seems like a good idea . 
  with the money the banks make with those loans they can pay the average uk banking salary of # 67.500 | $ 80.000 | $ 108.500 .
