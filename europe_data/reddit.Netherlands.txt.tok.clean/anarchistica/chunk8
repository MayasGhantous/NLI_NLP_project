  win-win !, 
   i guess the orks should speak dutch . 
  seeing as that tolkien was a british guy born in south africa i 'm not sure that would 've gone over too well . 
  they 're those really tall hills they got in other countries . 
   a ~ ~ n elephant ~ ~ mountain out of a ~ ~ mosquito ~ ~ molehill . 
  ftfy . 
  our languages are indeed quite similar in this regard . 
  tolkien though the best lotr translation was the nl one . 
  the guys who do bert & ernie said our version was the best translated one too . 
  english simply translates best to nl , we even have identical or similar expressions/sayings/figures of speech . 
  it works the other way around too . 
  i 've been mistaken for a native speaker while chatting with people , but i 've also unintentionally switched languages while chatting ( speaking en to a nl person and vice versa ) . 
  sometimes i even forget in which language i 've heard or read something . 
  ha ha , i discovered * two * misspelled words in the nl explanations . 
  :d i got 8/12 on spoken deutsch . 
  i was surprised by how much i understood considering i only took 2 years of that ( as opposed to 5 years of written * duits * ) . 
  yes , and all of the netherlands too - including belgium and luxemburg . 
  spain also controlled southern italy and the philippines at some point . 
  it started with norman mercenaries who originally fought in northern italy . 
  they figured the south was ripe for the taking , and sent messages home to spread the word . 
  they gradually conquered most of southern italy and even contested byzantine rule in the balkans . 
  this is kinda weird , but the original vikings already traversed these parts and beyond ( turkey , russia ) . 
  i was lazy . 
  it can be a quick nap ( dutje ) or napping ( dutten ) , nap works for both . 
  * italian states have had an enormous amount of cultural influence . 
  to name a few examples : the roman empire and its laws and customs , universities like that of bologna , classical composers like monte/verdi , and film directors like fellini . 
  * the northern italian states , also at times part of carolingian empire and the hre , functioned as a gateway between the eastern/islamic world and european countries . 
  they were similar to the republic , republics that strongly depended on trade and were relatively safe places for jews and progressive thinkers . 
  * the south has had a really weird past . 
  it was populated by greek colonists and carthago ( sicily ) . 
  it became part of both roman empires , was its own caliphate and host to a bunch of states called sicily or the two sicilies . 
  it was also part of the spanish state of aragon too . 
  and did i mention it was conquered by * vikings * at some point ? 
  * completed the european conquest of africa by annexing ethiopia in 1936 . 
  it then controlled what is now libya , ethiopia , eritrea and most of somalia . 
  this would be more useful using the phonetic alphabet . 
  even closely related languages might pronounce things differently : * en : aj * de : ich * nl : ik, 
  it 's actually a word here , it means ` nap ' . 
  clever . 
  make ugly coins that no one wants so they 'll spend them . 
  yeah ... you do realise you 're not making a lot of sense , right ? 
  because the nazis would n't have wanted all that gold , plus the elimination of a piece of neutral territory within their empire ? 
  israel currently controls about 90 % of 1948 palestine , wants free access to the west bank and control over the border with jordan . 
  only a deeply ignorant person would interpret concessions as `` ceasing to exist '' . 
  israel deliberately sabotaged the peace talks , this is n't on the palestinians . 
  israel has wanted jerusalem from the start , it 's why they did n't assign borders in 1948 . 
  they have recently completed its encirclement , it was already de facto annexed anyway . 
  there wo n't be any peace until israel makes concessions , and it wo n't since it can simply keep appropriating land . 
  i pay $ 20 for 20mb/s . 
  i do n't think i 've ever gotten even 2mb/s , though . 
   is it a business of the eurocracy to root for terrorists ? 
  you do realise israel was founded by terrorists , right ? 
  the idf used to be a terrorist organisation called `` haganah '' . 
   these funds are channeled to sponsor terrorist attacks on israel . 
  if that were true , we * should * be outraged . 
  palestinians have killed 85 israelis in the past five years . 
  israelis killed 1200-1400 palestinians during cast lead alone - including over 300 children . 
  we should be angry the palestinians do n't make better use of our money . 
   the palestinians were offered an unbelievably generous deal given the circumstances and still refused it it 's pretty depraved to use the word `` generous '' here . 
  if someone took over your country and offered you some scraps , while not even granting you sovereignty , would you take it ? 
  would you want to be remembered as the one who caved and legitimised the enemy conquest ? 
  note that france gets some $ 11.000.000.000 in farm subsidies . 
  also , luxemburg is the worst `` parasite '' , per capita they get 5,4 times as much from the eu as the # 2 . 
  in 2009 the french paid $ 100 each , the letzeburgers got $ 2360 each . 
  the byzantine empire * was * the roman empire . 
  also , i 'm not making an argument here . 
  look at spain and southern italy , much more elevation there . 
  in france , germany and the netherlands there 's very little in comparison . 
  this makes it a lot harder to maintain infrastructure for one thing . 
  switzerland is much more compact and more [ densily populated ] ( http://education.randmcnally.com/images/edpub/europe_population.png ) , and the mountains have actually been a benefit for them ( being able to stay neutral in both world wars for one thing ) . 
  some factors that might make sense : * [ few mountains aside from the alps ] ( http://ceipntrasradelapiedad.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/europe-map-of-europe-physical-relief-wikipedia.png ) . 
  * [ mayor rivers that facilitate trade ] ( http://education.randmcnally.com/images/edpub/europe_outline_ctrys_rivers.png ) . 
  * the sea and ( foreign ) dense population centers are never far away . 
  * dense population centers encourage development . 
  * recently part of french and german empires , and the eu . 
  * virtually untouched by mongolians , muslims and soviets . 
  belgi\u00eb would be an option , since tuition is much cheaper there ( ~ 1/3rd ) . 
  [ frankish empire in 814 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/frankish_empire_481_to_814-en.svg/1280px-frankish_empire_481_to_814-en.svg.png ) [ cropped original ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f9tgzsa.jpg ) it 's only us and wallonia who screw it up . 
  and who the fuck uses white borders on letters ? 
  my god . 
  * help the us and uk occupy iraq & afghanistan - fine . 
  * fight a brutal dictator - bad . 
  the hypocrisy is off the scale here , especially since we 're planning to send soldiers to mali . 
  it 's an insane restriction of personal freedom . 
  they might come back and start a jihad here ? 
  this does n't even remotely make sense . 
  are we killing muslims here ? 
  they might come back traumatised ? 
  because soldiers do n't ? 
  how many of them have gone on a killing spree ? 
  perhaps we should retro-actively sentence hemingway and orwell too ? 
  europa is a fake continent anyway , the borders are pretty much arbitrary . 
  luxembourg is part of the eu too , and so are we for that matter . 
   we 'll turn into a country of immigrants . 
  ( ... ) but there are those who are hostile to the state and therefore want to turn it into a state of people from all over the world . 
  - michael ben-ari this is the most ironic part , since this is exactly what happened in palestine . 
  hundreds of thousands of jews immigrated , they fought the ( british ) state and eventually turned it into a state for themselves . 
  the existence of a hyper-nationalistic fringe is n't too surprising though , judaism is inherently racist and all israeli political parties are creepily nationalistic ( some , like shas , are even worse ) . 
  i doubt even half the israeli population actually supports this , though . 
  and european countries are at least as bad when it comes to `` illegal '' migrants , we lock them up too , including children .
