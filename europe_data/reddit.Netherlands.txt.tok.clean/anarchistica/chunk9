   national plans to boost competitiveness and implement social reforms better enjoy minimum wage and social security while it lasts !, 
  i ca n't wait until the aldi-model is implemented everywhere . 
  six euros an hour for everyone locked up in those shitholes , miliards for the bosses !, 
   jobless levels are so low that the country has almost reached full employment unemplyoment is at 5,2 % . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;  there is talk of an $ 11 billion fund for infrastructure alone . 
  this is no small matter , actually . 
  yeah , de is doing alright financially , but that 's because they 've simply skimped on maintenance . 
  according to a recent estimate the deficit might be as much as a billion , a real billion that is - $ 1.000.000.000.000 . 
  that 11 mld wo n't even make a dent . 
   merkel wants tangible amendments to the european union treaties : more power for brussels , and even more power for the much-criticized european commission . 
  `` unfortunately , there is no other option , '' say government officials . 
  basically , this is how ( neo - ) liberals have pushed their agenda for over two decades . 
  it just `` has '' to be done . 
  and labour has gone along with it obediently , fucking traitors . 
  these plans are even better , screw sovereignty , let alone democracy . 
  fun test : ask everyone you know what the european commision is . 
  i doubt even one in ten knows . 
  heck , i barely know what it is , and i 'm a politically-engaged intellectual . 
  kinda surprised spain does n't have [ life imprisonment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/life_imprisonment ) , despite the eta . 
  it seems to be an iberian thing if you look at [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/lifesentencemapnew.svg/2000px-lifesentencemapnew.svg.png ) . 
  by the way , guess which is the only western country that has life imprisonment with no chance of parole ? 
  other members of this esteemed club are enlightened nations like saudi arabia , north korea , syria , indonesia ... 
  i 've always learnt western russia , west-most kazakhstan , the three caucasian nations and thrace are european . 
   russia has managed to successfully kill tens of thousands in its own country what ? 
   also , i 'd like to point out that the vast majority of violence in the iraq war were due to the iraqi civil war that was unleashed when america created a power vacuum in iraq . 
  there is , at least to me , an obvious difference between america foolishly pulling the lid off of a boiling pot and being unable to contain the resulting sectarian violence bush/cheney/rumsfeld knew they were n't sending enough troops . 
  military brass spoke about 500.000 , they sent 150.000 - who rushed to baghdad so bush could get re-elected . 
  and do n't forget about the first two gulf wars . 
  also , afghanistan , yemen , pakistan , sudan , somalia , etc. 
  russia has n't invaded/bombed a dozen countries killing hundreds of thousands in the last decade alone . 
  that 's what i meant , if we try to boycot the russians we might end up helping someone who is even more retarded , like the saudis or , even worse , the us . 
  the only way to deal with russia is to reduce our dependency on their fossil fuels . 
  unfortunately , most of those are in the hands of authoritarian shitholes , so you 'll likely end up helping some other kind of barbarians . 
  sustainable energy is n't ( seen as ) a viable option , and as our gas runs out ( 15-20 years ) we 'll only come to depend on them more . 
  great . 
  other countries do n't have enkhuizen or alkmaar , duh . 
  also , i think that in other countries birthday parties are supposed to be fun . 
  no , that 's make-up . 
  birthday parties : everyone has to sit in a circle and you 're not allowed to move your seat . 
  you better hope you 're anywhere near the food . 
  plus , when you enter , you have to congratulate everyone . 
  and our santa claus/children 's friend is a bishop who has moorish servants do all his work while he sits on a horse : [ sinterklaas and `` black petes '' ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cduyvzcbudk/umuuybape_i/aaaaaaaatug/d0hfkzljgxe/s1600/sinterklass+2.jpg ) . 
  also , we have [ jewcookies ] ( http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4142/4885451301_6a382f0f27_b.jpg ) . 
   i did n't think the two countries had strong business ties , so i am not sure banning tulips and dairy supplies would have much effect on their economy . 
  flowers make up about 6 % of exports to russia , which totalled 6,4 mld in 2011 . 
  i dunno about dairy , we mostly export machines to russia . 
  imports were 17 mld in 2011 , 90 % of that is fossil fuels - almost a third of our ff imports . 
  this will only increase in the future , as our natural gas supply will start running out in 15-20 years . 
   is putin simply trying to show he can intimidate and bully countries , even western european ones ? 
  when putin visited , there were protests due to his discrimination of gays . 
  i think the current situation is the following : * putin gets back at us for the protests . 
  * putin gets to play `` manly man '' - russia stronk !, 
  * it also serves as a distraction for his policies , the fact that it 's us ( first country to legalise same-sex marriage ) is only icing on the cake . 
  russia makes about 10 mld off us , and they need our tractors , phones and office appliances - there 's a reason why he only threatens to limit ` luxury goods ' . 
  nb : a russian refugee ( opposition activist ) committed suicide in his cell * when he was told he would have to go back . 
  strange the article does n't mention [ dolmatov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suicide_of_aleksandr_dolmatov ) . 
  ** yes , we imprison refugees , even children . 
  the english decided to do that to us . 
  haha antwerpen , you so small !, 
  also , since consumers act 100 % rational , we do n't need advertising . 
   what 's the greatest ? 
  consumers act 100 % rational . 
  or perhaps it would be `` capitalism works '' . 
  it is an inherently destructive system , i find it highly amusing that we 're all pretending to be in a crisis right now . 
   parents who have worked hard to provide a good life for their kids ah yes , the second greatest falacy of capitalism ; rich people work hard , poor people do n't . 
   do n't want to have to pay for someone else 's kids ' educations . 
  one does wonder if the us will ever come to its senses . 
  russia is in europa , so it 's possible . 
  however , i doubt it will be -25 in italy anytime soon ( -23 is the record ) . 
  they also tested [ literacy proficiency ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ztmeuv3.jpg ) . 
  finland ( 1 , 2 ) , nl ( 2,3 ) and japan ( 1 , 4 ) performed best in both tests . 
  obviously , eating raw fish and being invaded by russia makes you real smart . 
  as for the us , who scored below average on both ... this is what you get when you let people attend college because they can throw a ball really well . 
  :p srsly though , i remember rik smits ( nl player in nba a decade ago ) commenting about how some of his teammates could n't even multiply two two-digit numbers . 
  the real problem with the us seems to be socio-economic equality . 
  blacks and latino 's scored far worse , and overall wealth correlated to proficiency . 
  apparently , in ( parts of ? ), 
  the us , the school you attend depends on the `` school district '' you live in - and schools get funding from that district . 
  so if you grow up in the projects , you better hope michelle pfeiffer shows up or otherwise you 're screwed . 
  solution : eat more raw fish and allow russia to invade . 
  it 's for your own good !, 
  we 've got a high iq , the highest lowest educational level ( our dummies are the smartest dummies ) , very high standard of living , relatively high socio-economic equality and an excellent educational system compared to the vast majority of countries - at least , according to international rankings . 
  they likely only test relatively easy things , and most people will have learnt them here . 
  we might not be super-good at maths , but we 're also not super-bad , or even bad . 
   do n't pretend that what you 're doing is not outrageous . 
  what is more outrageous , mutilating your defenseless kid because the insane , lying , racist mass-murderer you worship demands it , or giving children control over their own bodies while also allowing them to fully enjoy sex later on ? 
   last time i checked , gandhi was n't an expert on judaism or islam or christianity , so he 's not a terribly reliable source . 
  `` because we disallow discrimination based on birth hinduism is n't welcome ''  my point is that this is something all jews , even the most integrated , secular jews , agree on . 
  no , they do n't . 
  http://www.jewsagainstcircumcision.org/  the most europeanized , integrationist secularists in germany . 
  de does n't have the most integrated jews here , we do . 
  i doubt the average nlers could name even 5 without the use of wikipedia/google . 
   you 're sticking your head in the sand if you think banning circumcision will not outrage the vast majority of jews . 
  there 's no law against doing something outrageous . 
   none of those practices is considered to be essential to any of those religions . 
  gandhi sure seemed to think so . 
  i also find it amusing that you think that 's a good excuse . 
  what does it say about a religion when physical child abuse is essential ? 
    a handful of countries outlawing circumcision will not end circumcision , but it will convince jews in those countries to move elsewhere . 
  nah , they 'll do it in secret first , they 'll often get away with it , like labia-cutters .
