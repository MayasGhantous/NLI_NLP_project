who used sarin on women and children ? 
  would 've been nice if european leaders had shown some bolivian balls . 
  hey , i know these words ... 
  good point , well explained . 
  however , i 'd reason the other way around : i think it all starts with the will to unite , which is a political question . 
  if we are willing to unite ( because we want to prevent destructive wars among us and/or because we want to take matters in our own hands rather than being divided and ruled by superpowers ) , then we can . 
  only then come the economical ( and other practical ) questions : how to align our economies , our language , our laws and so on . 
  and then still we 'll never reach a homogeneous economy , but that 's no problem per se : economies are never homogeneous within countries . 
  what do you think ? 
  if only our government would have listened to us like this on the 6th of april last year . 
  of course nobody will promote corruption , lol . 
  but corruption was not invented this month , so i can imagine that it was a topic during the campaign . 
  did nobody ( journalists or opposition ) warn the people about psd/dragnea ? 
  and it 's easy to make empty promises , but why do people believe them ? 
  or are the promises not empty and does the government actually have solid plans ( apart from this one ) ? 
  thank you for bringing this up . 
  i 'm genuinely curious why this government was elected recently . 
  were there also other reasons why the psd won , aside from the ones you already mentioned ? 
  was this topic ( corruption ) discussed during the campaign ? 
  in addition , the highlighted part in the picture refers to stop operation soros and is a protest against the influence of soros funded ngos .

  well , it was long . 
  but i like the historical approach : it provides a valuable background to understand the current situation . 
  the man knows a lot about the subject , but he 's not neutral . 
  it is noticable ( but not explicitly ) by the way he presents the facts and developments and how he leaves certain things out . 
  for example , he does n't address the expansion of nato ( which i pointed out above ) until he 's being asked about it . 
  and even then he fails to convince me , but you may feel otherwise of course . 
  another example is quite in the beginning , when he says that russia was only partly involved in wwii . 
  he may be right that only 5 % of the country was occupied , but when 20 million ( ! ), 
  people die ( more than in any other country , i think ) , then such a claim is inappropriate ( and disrespectful ) . 
  and to me , it sounds like presenting a biased view on reality . 
  i must admit it 's all quite subtle until he starts talking about us vs. them and who is winning around 1:18:00 . 
  more generally , this entire lecture is aimed at convincing rather than neutrally discussing everything that has happened from various perspectives . 
  aside from his position though , snyder does know a lot about the history , the culture and many events . 
  much , much more than i and i learned a lot from lectures like this when we , in the netherlands , had a referendum about the association agreement between the eu and ukraine in april 2016 . 
  ironically , i got ` my ' idea about the effect of nato 's expansion from foreign affairs , the magazine that is issued by the council on foreign relations , of which snyder happens to be a member . 
   you can find it here , although it 's no longer accessible without subscription : https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2014-08-18/why-ukraine-crisis-west-s-fault let me also say a few things about the content , which is obviously more important than the rest . 
  i do n't have any way to proof it , but i 'm hesitant to accept his stance that the situation in crimea was independent from the situation in kiev . 
  i think that if nothing had happened in ukraine and yanukovich had still been in power , russia would n't have felt the need to take over crimea . 
  i also do n't believe that shale gas ( or natural gas , what was it ? ), 
  was the reason for taking over crimea . 
  as others have pointed out in this thread , it was all about the marine base in sevastopol . 
  also , he can not say that russia shot down mh17 . 
  by the time of his lecture , the investigation was still going on and when the results were presented , the committee was very careful with their conclusions . 
  they did n't say it was russia who did it , so i find his statement unprofessional and biased . 
  i could go on and on , but i do n't have time . 
  i do n't like to disagree with so many people and lose my karma  but i 'm afraid i stand by my point . 
  i do like the discussion though and i 'm glad you shared the lecture . 
  thank you .

  thank you . 
   i do n't mind that it 's long . 
  and i 'm always interested in things that go against my world view . 
  that 's how one learns , right ? 
  i do n't have time now , but i 'll let you know what i think after i 've seen it . 
  why ? 
  thanks !, 
  will do . 
  interesting thought . 
  however , i do n't like the idea to abandon international law altogether . 
  thanks , i 'll check it out . 
  do you have a link or the name of the documentary ? 
  sounds interesting . 
  putin was very harsh on the oligarchs , so i can imagine they 're not his biggest fan base . 
  but i think putin is a bit old-fashioned indeed . 
  medvedev , for instance , seems much more progressive regarding economic policy . 
  i know it 's more than a bit controversial , but i 'm quite convinced that this is the important bigger picture that is often hard to see , because we 're distracted by news that is colored and focused on smaller , but more visible events ( like riots , assassinations , decisions by governments etc. ) . 
  and i 'm glad that you question everything . 
  go look for answers . 
   and please correct me where i 'm wrong . 
  all true . 
  crimea is very important , but the move is ` just ' one battle in a larger war . 
  you are absolutely right . 
  however , even though the referendum was widely not recognized as democratic does n't necessarily mean that it was n't democratic .
