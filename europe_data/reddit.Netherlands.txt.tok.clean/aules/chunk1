just hire us dutchmen, 
  i think it was sarcastic, 
  yeah it 's just dutch with a german accent, 
  they ca n't even support their current population . 
  life is not going to improve with this growth . 
  i wonder if german people understand that, 
  that 's not just in amsterdam, 
  empresses, 
  just because monarchs are n't recognizable in belgium does n't mean they are n't in the rest of europe . 
  i wonder why belgium still has a monarch , absolutely nobody seems to care for them . 
  monarchy is kind of irrelevant these days , but in belgium it 's on a whole new level of irrelevancy . 
  rip to all germans who died there as well, 
  africa had a smaller population than europe for a long time until 1995 , i 'm amazed to see how much they will grow . 
  it 's unsustainable for them , so i do n't think these projections will become reality . 
  countries with low populations are very unstable in unemploymeny graphs and the graphs get unreadable when you add to many countries . 
  you can check slovenia out with the link of my source . 
  it 's the newest available, 
  source : data from eurostat , [ google public data ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) presentation, 
  do n't let me get started on this one ... 
  luxembourg : to small for the relevant clique , to big for the irrelevant clique, 
  `` small . 
  clogs . 
  dikes . 
  like a mix of germany and england . '', 
  that was the joke, 
  no ofc not !!!, 
  ... . ... help, 
  london really is the economic and cultural capital of europe . 
  of all major cities i went to , london was my favorite and they only one i 'd actually want live in . 
  the uk has multiple other great city and even the countryside is very beautiful !, 
  no rebel-netherlands , we do n't . 
  green , hills , music , pubs , farms , religion , gay marriage referendum , island, 
  latin !, 
  that market scene in london looks pretty awkward if you realize a stranger filmed for you . 
  post it on r/international, 
   north hardworking  south more outgoing aka europe and every european country , it seems, 
  not a particular conversation but french people ( german people already seem to know this ) , be aware , everyone here learns french at school , we can understand most of it !, 
  are you sure you are dutch ? 
  that cockiness stereotype does n't count at all for the south of the netherlands aka limburg and noord-brabant . 
  they 're mostly catholic . 
  i 've been so many times to flanders and it is basically the same as southern netherlands . 
  i think you mean races not ethnicities ... race is about various sets of physical characteristics , ethnicity about common nationality or shared cultural traditions . 
  demographics is basically the only thing where racism can be justified . 
  well ethnicity is mostly about culture ...  membership of an ethnic group tends to be associated with shared cultural heritage , ancestry , history , homeland , language or dialect , the term culture specifically including aspects such as religion , mythology and ritual , cuisine , dressing style , etc. 
  what else would it be ? 
  skin color or things like facial features ? 
  if that would be the case , a lot of ethnic groups would 've already merged together like dutch and germans or austrians and germans . 
  it 's the culture that divides them . 
  [ flemish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flemish_people ) people and [ walloons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walloons ) are two different ethnic groups , like for example dutch and german people . 
  they do n't recognize themselves as dutch or french but speak those languages . 
  flemish people are germanic , while most anthropologists bind walloons more with the french . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_groups_in_europe ) and yes it should be < 75 % not  75 % and the maltese people deserve a capital m, 
  saturn people let 's unite !, 
  was n't that region , where dacia is the # 1 , used to be called dacia as well ? 
  how things will change ... 
  i actually really enjoy the crowded places, 
  croatia 's shore , prague in czech republic , slovenia or poland . 
  thank god golf stream . 
  peace visualized . 
  til !, 
  thanks , 
  yet there are excluding a part of the country as big as kosovo . 
  america had not nearly as much people living in their country as europe by the time 3/4 were already covered ... damm even now europe has 2 times the us population . 
  why do people say bosnia ? 
  why not bosnia herzegovina, 
  the fact that people actually have to drive in order to go somewhere is just weird for me . 
  it sounds like something from the 1900 's . 
  edit : wow thanks to my flair everyone thinks i 'm referring to the wonderful dutch bicycle + public transit plan , but i actually think that the idea of having to drive ( concentrate on the road etc ) in order to go somewhere is ridiculous . 
  it 's not like that ca n't be automated ... 
  i 'd bet all my money that manual operated cars are gone by the end of the century , at least in the big cities . 
  i 'm not referring to bicycles at all , although i think they 're perfect for my little country ( and denmark ) . 
  not anymore , 2014 data says they went under < 2000 cigarettes per capita, 
  those highest ranked countries have such a good reputation because they are western , well-known and not interfering in world politics too much . 
  people with clear opinions will always have haters , and so do countries . 
  lannisters always pay their debts , ca n't say that about greece though ... 
  moldova might be pro-eu now but that does n't make the eu pro-modolva , considering their economy . 
  j\u00f6b j\u00f6b, 
  i say ** federalized benelux 2k15 !!, 
  those numbers make me really skeptical about this . 
  seriously , 600,000 people and 9 % of the total gdp ? 
  tbh i think most of us consider ` eastern europe ' as a all the irrelevant countries that only europeans know the names of . 
  yes , let her take east-prussia from russia as exchange for crimea and this . 
  i agree, 
  i 'm actually kinda sad that we and other countries do n't spend much more on space exploration, 
  great, 
  i love that i can always see the level of accuracy of maps just by looking at flevoland, 
  amazing shots yet shity music, 
  it means `` you ( plural ) can '', 
  i know right , she 's talks monotone and word for word . 
  dutch people , you can also watch the stream at npo . 
  i feel like the greek people are being tricked into voting ` no ' because their government says they will get a better deal if they do so . 
  they wo n't get a better deal , there might be some slight changes but that 's it . 
  i deliberately did that for the sake of the comparison , and i also put a note under the statistics that i was using the ** contiguous ** united states . 
  i always wondered why nigeria is estimated to have a population of [ 729 million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_future_population_ ( united_nations , _ medium_variant ) by 2100 , i think it all makes sense now . 
  tbh , how could it be less random ? 
  i do n't see which comparisons would 've made more sense ? 
  i agree comparing indonesia and argentina with europe is quite random though , but that was just for fun, 
  remeber that french guiana is a region of france , metropolitan france is 551,695 km2 . 
  well at least the stats will be incorrect haha, 
  214,162 ( france ) + 135,776 ( spain ) + 122,545 ( poland ) + 115,698 ( germany ) + 77,651 ( italy ) + 90,961 ( romania ) + 56,121 ( uk ) + 45,782 ( hungary ) + 26,749 ( greece ) + 33,099 ( bulgaria ) + 29,999 ( czech ) + 29,261 ( lithuania ) + 24,368 ( sweden ) + 15,898 ( portugal ) + 22,295 ( denmark ) + 19,913 ( finland ) + 17,926 ( latvia ) + 14,566 ( croatia ) = 1,022,770 ( so that info isnt correct anyway ) + 14,264 ( slovakia ) + 13,677 ( austria ) + 11,587 ( ireland ) + 8,302 ( belgium ) + 7,441 ( netherlands ) + 5,207 ( estonia ) + 1,719 ( slovenia ) + 999 ( cyprus ) + 709 ( luxembourg ) = 1,085,949 yes you 're right 1.8 is way to much i think i added switzerland , norway , former yugoslavia and ukraine as well ...
