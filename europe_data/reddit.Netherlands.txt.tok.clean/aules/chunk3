  geopolitics is becoming more and more important . 
  that 's why i do n't think it 's a good idea to rely so much on the usa when it comes to military . 
  china has officially surpassed the usa in number # 1 economy , why not military ? 
  we simply do n't know what will happen in the future , it can be good for europa but also bad . 
  i think it 's important for europe to be able to protect it self and keep up it 's economy . 
  maybe the european union is all it takes , maybe not . 
  yes , we have to unite in order to stay relevant . 
  the world is becoming multi polar , soon it 's not just the ` usa and europe ' anymore , like it always was . 
  many big countries are one the rise ; china , india , brazil , indonesia and even smaller counties like south korea , malaysia , etc. 
  countries like germany ( even though it 's europe 's biggest ) just cant compete with an industrialized china that has much more manpower and resources . 
  we have to unite to be able to compete with countries like those . 
  and at the end of the day are n't we all the same ? 
  we all have a western mindset , a shared history and common ancestors of which all our languages originate from . 
  and has n't our history thought us that we can achieve much greater things by uniting ourselves ? 
  we have to look past our nationalism because it only causes war , and i think we 've had enough of that already . 
  let 's unite and work together . 
  of ' 6 a 7 euro ', 
  well it can also remind us that wars like world war 2 should never happen again, 
  maybe we can have battle of normandy wwii coin when it 's not ` too soon ' anymore, 
  wow i 've never seen that one, 
  i really like the euro coins , although i think the bills could be better ; for example the us dollar have very nice bills, 
  sweden is a very big country with a very low density . 
  they have enough space . 
  also , in sweden nobody talks with their neighbors so they do n't really care . 
  but this is just my theory and it 's probably false, 
  well shit i regret not investing in eastern poland now, 
  `` you do n't have a bad name . 
  your name means that sooner of later we will pay the amount due . 
  do you understand , angela ? ', 
  hahah that made me laugh so hard, 
  actually santa class is an american tradition based on sinterklaas , a dutch tradition which our settlers took to the usa . 
  so thank us !, 
  thank you romania for vampires ... 
  i almost caught one yesterday on my way home when i tried to hit him with my car . 
  lets not forget about the slavic one, 
  i had like 2 years of french of school and it was very bad at it , so i 'll try to translate it just for fun : `` the time that the stimulus attends the horse , since that the reaction downwards , you can generalize ending your meal '', 
  ctrl + f netherlands shit no results, 
  it 's 2015 we ca n't just force them to marry . 
  i wonder what would happen if princess amalia actually married a belgium prince ... 
  maybe the dutch federation or the republic ( as we probably cant keep our monarchy ), 
  well , a lot of lives have been lost in america 's foreign wars which were not always for the purpose of peacekeeping but rather for the american economy or the maintenance of it 's strategic advantage . 
  but to be honest i think you 're right . 
  history has shown us that a uni , or bipolar world is more stable than a multipolar one , and i 'd rather have america as hegemony than for example russia or china . 
  says the american, 
  ` nice ' is not a dutch word though . . 
  but more than 90 % speaks english here so we regularly use english words in a sentence, 
  everyone should use the word gezellig , it 's such a useful , diverse , ... gezellig word, 
  and gesellschaft would be gezelschap, 
  til the netherlands is more catholic than protestant, 
  we 're all humans as well, 
  oh yes !, 
  and liechtenstein of course , they are the biggest polluters of all of them haha, 
  thanks germany and france for all the garbage, 
  europe looks distorted or is this some kind of weird map projection ? 
  could be worse i guess ... what about benelux ? 
  there are so many problems with it, 
  denmark : 6,8 czech republic : 5,9 sorry i forgot to include them, 
  i accidentally deleted them on the survey, 
  | rank | country | average rating | | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | | # 1 | the netherlands | 7,0 | | # 1 | norway | 7,0 | | # 2 | finland | 6,9 | | # 3 | denmark | 6,8 | | # 3 | germany | 6,8 | | # 4 | ireland | 6,7 | | # 5 | sweden | 6,5 | | # 5 | iceland | 6,5 | | # 6 | uk | 6,4 | | # 6 | france | 6,4 | | # 7 | austria | 6,2 | | # 7 | estonia | 6,2 | | # 8 | belgium | 6,0 | | # 8 | poland | 6,0 | | # 8 | croatia | 6,0 | | # 8 | switzerland | 6,0 | this map was made with a survey/poll i made . 
  [ click here ] ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1anscycv5kjganugm2xk223sh6fhjm3jl1p1skfw2bye/viewanalytics ) for the complete results . 
  i made a new survey because i missed some countries , but it did n't got enough participants so i deleted it again . 
  only the favorability of ireland is based on the second survey, 
  pls dont remove stampot, 
  i will probably put them up this evening . 
  thanks for the suggestion , i updated the survey . 
  sorry i 'll update the form with serbia, 
  yes , sorry , i 'll change it to english . 
  yes that would be a fun to see but i do n't know if i can still change it without deleting all the uk ratings, 
  yes and i 'll probably make a map and post it in a new thread . 
  just your general thoughts on a country , not based on anything in particular . 
  there are more countries i have n't included , but i think it would take up too much time to fill in the form if i would include them all . 
  no but that name is beautiful and so smart, 
  just because their economy is based on the western one does n't mean they are western . 
  they have different norms and values , their culture is very different . 
  but i agree they are getting more and more globalized . 
  romania ? 
  yes but if you 'd visit pewglobal.org/**2015**/06/27/ ... you 'd get the same page, 
  it 's the latin american group, 
  [ this is easy ] ( http://gallery.photo.net/photo/4123507-md.jpg ),

  1/french we all speak english anyway, 
  [ source ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2007/06/27/global-unease-with-major-world-powers/snag-0073/ ), 
  yes the little bit of french that i speak , i speak fluently, 
  dutch , english , german and a little bit of french . 
  berlin to crimea is about 2000 km and lisbon to new york is about 5500 km . 
  there 's also a huge ocean between the us and europe and germany to ukraine is just 2000 kilometers of grass plaines . 
  it 's funny how people in western europe make fun of invading other countries because it almost seems unreal nowadays , while putin annexes the crimea and invades ukraine just a few hundred km away from germany . 
  oh god i feel ashamed, 
  well that 's it guys ; the conspiracies are over ... 
  they have to update the this map everytime russia annexes something else, 
  [ putins girlfriend is not pregnant ] ( https://twitter.com/bneeditor/status/576833924736892928 ), 
  yes the netherlands as well, 
  source ? 
  this is probably fake, 
  the population density is so high in malta because its so small ; it 's micro-state so it does n't really count because you would have a country with a higher density as the netherlands in almost any case if you 'd make a border around a couple of cities . 
  [ its still bigger than alaska ] ( http://imgur.com/lvs2glj ), 
  man that is stooping low haha, 
  [ america is also very cute ] ( http://imgur.com/oplaceh ), 
  the port of piraeus is also completely taken over by the chinese, 
  yes exactly haha,
