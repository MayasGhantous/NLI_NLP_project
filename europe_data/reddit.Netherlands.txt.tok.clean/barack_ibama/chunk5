  and while we return to carry on our normal life , they will return to a life ( and friends ) filled with ignorance and hostility . 
  good luck with teaching your new class then , it 's good that you have that attitude . 
  heh , it 's not really paranoia when / r/european [ openly celebrates victory for flooding and brigading this sub . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/3jodda/we_won/ ), 
   i read the text and i even shared it with my friends . 
  translation : i read the text and linked it somewhere else so that people can vote-brigade / u/dfractalh +10 / -10 votes are not natural for this kind of comment chain . 
  lol , seriously , you 're bringing in reproduction rate into the table ? 
  if anything , [ that myth has been disproved many years ago . 
  ] ( http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2011/01/27/will-pew-muslim-birth-rate-study-finally-silence-the-eurabia-claim/ ), 
  and to see how a couple months ago , people were in heavy denial that there were indeed a concerted effort to flood and vote brigade this sub . . smh . . 
  not really . 
  most school shooters have some certain targeted individuals in mind when they initiate their shootings , usually people that they have issues with . 
  or they just want to exact revenge on the school itself for their perceived mistreatment . 
  a shooting fell into hate crime when the shooter shot at people just because they belong to a certain social group . 
  in this case , the shooter does not actually know the individual that he targeted . 
  i did n't say major , i say significant as in non-negligible . 
  finding a job offer that pays for way more ( $ 100k vs. $ 80k ) with less tax and better perks & benefits of course plays a larger role . 
  new zealand eh ? 
  somewhere towards your general direction . 
  leaving the continent . 
  turned in my notice last month , got a new job lined up at the other side of the world , packed up 90 % of my stuff , booked a one-way ticket , all that jazz . 
  honestly , people who thought europe as the best place to live in the world are wildly overestimating how things are in here . 
  lots of places around the world are just better in terms of economic prosperity and creature comfort . 
  probably connections with local corrupt politician . 
  how else would he still be granted a license for the hotel after numerous prior objections from the police ? 
  i bet part of that $ 15.000 also went to bribe uk officials . 
  [ this is the global economic center of gravity . 
  ] ( http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5293de3d69bedde417e01e2d/how-the-economic-center-of-the-world-moved-from-ad-1-to-ad-2010.jpg ) it used to be in or very close to europe this past few centuries , especially so this past 100 years , but now it 's accelerating faster and faster towards asia , making europe less relevant for the global economy and trade . 
  you are a fool if you think your current levels of prosperity will remain the same against the changing global realities . 
  i can safely say the pessimistic nature of this sub contributed significantly with my decision to quit europe . 
  will be moving out in a couple of weeks , ca n't wait to hear people bitching about something else beside xenophobia-fueled scaremongering and tanking economy . 
   because you sound like one of those people who 's more words than deeds . 
  you know what , message me again in a month and i 'll send you photos of my one-way flight away from the netherlands . 
   but wait , that can be faked too , so i dunno how to convince your paranoid little mind that i am moving away for real . 
  oh well , no use spending any effort to try convince a mere internet stranger . 
   actually i travel a lot , have no doubt seen a bit more of the world than you did to know it 's a pretty incredibly comfortable country . 
  sure you are , dear . 
   you 'll find that that ` money ' is hard to come by in your ` growth regions ' especially for a foreigner lol what ? 
  seriously ? 
  your dissonance is incredible , haha . 
  not every part of the world is as xenophobic as your little corner of the basement . 
  :d read about [ how expat packages are getting higher and higher ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jnylander/2015/05/20/expat-pay-is-getting-fatter-in-china/ ) , and see how highly skilled `` foreigners '' like us are being lavishly treated in `` growth regions '' . 
  lol , i already bought a house in the city where we will move , why would n't i `` actually move '' ? 
  you seem to overestimate how comfortable the netherlands is compared to the rest of the world . 
  travel more a bit , kid . 
  well , you know what they said , leave a sinking ship before it hits rock bottom , haha . 
  i 'll be the first wave of expats leaving the country , just observe how it goes within the next 18 months . 
  and you know how much harm could such expat exodus be ? 
  if i stayed here until retirement age , i will pay almost 1.5 million euros in taxes , so the government can kiss that million euro goodbye . 
  multiply that with thousands of expats , and suddenly you have billions of euros less money for public projects or subsidies . 
  this is not to mention the loss in knowledge and brain drain that us highly skilled expats have . 
  and it 's not just the growing xenophobia and miserable economy , rapid growth in other regions around the world meant that the money is shifting away from europe , so there 's as much `` pull factor '' beside the `` push factor '' that made living elsewhere in the world is becoming increasingly more comfortable than in the netherlands . 
  and here we see the prime example why casual racism is soooo common and tolerated in the netherlands . 
  because people like / u/bosgeus thinks there are absolutely nothing wrong with someone being a racist asshole in national television . 
  lol , fuck off , i ** am ** getting out of this fucking country . 
  [ my own root comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4i50gq/bbc_news_cologne_sex_attack_charge_dropped/d2vb8pz ) said that :  i 'm so fucking glad i 'm moving out of this continent in a couple of months . 
  have fun rotting here while people like wilders kept on ~ ~ make holland great again ~ ~ ruining the country . 
  definitely , looking forward to it !, 
  i 'm also fucking asian , so what ? 
  lol , you seem to get all your info about asia from 1970s exploitation movies . 
  not the native part , buddy , the `` european '' part . 
  there wo n't be any such thing as a unified european identity with the kind of squabbling and lack of control that each member states has . 
  not in any kind of foreseeable future . 
  lol yeah , the only group where the dutch are not casually racist at are caucasians . 
  oh wait , that means the dutch are casually racist . 
  :d casual racism like [ this ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/suzanne-ma/hollands-got-talent-racist_b_4324894.html ) are abound if you 're not a caucasian . 
  :d and you know what , i 'll take asia , where your status is based on how much money you earn or how much power you have , rather than what your skin color or religious belief is , any day compared to here . 
  :d at least asians are honest . 
  it 's my pleasure !, 
  not through the lack of trying though !, 
  and you know the saying , it 's the thought that matters !, 
  especially so for politicians !, 
  lol , there are no such thing as an european native , with every member states being as fractious as they are . 
  eh , i used to live there for 10 + years , was n't nowhere that bad . 
  things are more or less the same compared to here . 
  and whilst the racism in asia are gradually toning down as regional commerce grows a lot , in europe racism are being glorified and growing up by the day !, 
  with hungary as the comparison , [ i 'm sure that 's not a high bar to pass !, 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungarian-prime-minister-viktor-orban-bans-islamisation-a7005401.html ) , 
  yes i am , and i thought it was pretty evident from my root comment :  because , and let 's be honest here , a lot of those redditors think of ** us ** muslims as subhumans . 
  and nope , i did n't base my decisions based on some stormfr * nters whining in this sub . 
  you know how anti-immigration and xenophobic fervor has been sweeping the continent this past year . 
  and it 's not just some fringe groups either , politicians everywhere have been seizing this trend for the sake of gaining mass popularity . 
  all i 'm saying is , all things considered , asia is a better proposition for me than europe right now . 
  back ? 
  lol buddy , i have n't even been to middle-east . 
  thanks !, 
  and i wish the best of luck too for you !, 
  eh , almost 40 % of singapore 's population are foreigners , so you 're not that far off !, 
  compare that to amsterdam , long claimed to be one of the major melting pot of europe , but where the non-dutch population are just a meager 12 % !, 
  eh , ca n't be worse than how this sub has been this past year , haha . 
  and good thing it 's a fucking continent of four billion people , with dozens of countries and cultures , and the racist regions are easily avoidable . 
  asia is an entire fucking continent of four billion people , buddy , you 're going to held me responsible for all of them ? 
  i 've been living here for almost a decade , and i agree that it is awesome !, 
  i , for one , will continue to watch news about europe and hope it will keep on being awesome , but for now , life at another side of the world beckons me !, 
   best of success for you , internet stranger !, 
  nor do i , or any muslims that i know of , consider any non-muslims to be subhuman !, 
  i personally think it 's not mine to judge what other people are , at the end of the day what we all want is to go home to our family and enjoy our lives . 
  you 'd be surprised !, 
   lots of melting pot cities in asia !, 
  oh , you mean [ this kind of tolerance ?
