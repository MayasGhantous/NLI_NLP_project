they are now [ denying ] ( https://twitter.com/israelinireland/status/525216487444082688 ) they said this . 
  the plot thickens . 
  i understand your sentiment . 
  and i too love seeing pictures of the places and situations of my fellow europeans . 
  i too love showing off my tiny corner of europe to fellow europeans . 
  the issue is the nature of such posts : it takes at least a few minutes to read through a news-article or informative article . 
  it takes a minute or two to grasp the meaning of a certain infographic or statistic . 
  but it takes only once sencond-long glance over the thumbnail to like a picture of a sun going down over madrid . 
  as such , the latter receive , on average , a lot more upvotes ; this is a known issue on reddit as a whole ( the top-reddits all contain of nearly 100 % of this fast-to-grasp content ) . 
  many subreddits , therefore , disallow memes , funny pictures , image macros and often even imgur-links as a whole . 
  i think we , / r/europe can keep this a happy , and content-heavy place by simply not encouraging such ` shallow ' content . 
  and often even discourage this content with a downvote or two . 
  not by enstating beurocracy or rules , but through the votes of the people in it . 
  ( and yes , i am aware of the irony , saying this in sub mostly about the eu ), 
  while this is a beautiful picture , i 've still downvoted it . 
  i 'd love to see more news , in-depth articles and discussions about europe here . 
  rather than touristic images . 
  there are more then enough subreddits for images already . 
  we have meters installed mostly everywhere in the netherlands . 
  the idea is - like / u/vladraptor points out - to educate people to be sparse with clean water . 
  i - personally - think this is a good thing : if something costs money , you are also given an opportunity to save : by being economic with water ( or waste , or gas , or electricity ) you not only help the environment , but mostly help your own wallet . 
  win-win . 
  if you decide to not fix that dripping tap ; to clean your car with the garden hose , to sprinkle your lawn or to fill your swimming pool , you are taxing your neighbors and fellow countrymen : after all , its the people - through taxes - who pay for the water you are wasting . 
  but i guess it is not so much the principle of having to pay for utilities such as drinkingwater , but rather the amount that is to be payed . 
  because i am very consious about using water , my bill is just around $ 70 per year ; and i am happy to know that the guy down the street who has his sprinklers on most of the summermonths pays his share : that i am not paying for his waste of water . 
  wow . 
  in dutch we have a word `` akkefietje '' - a trifle , or little incident . 
  turns out this is most probably a [ reference to `` aquavite '' ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fnl.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fakkefietje_%2528term%2529&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  a big part of the particular problem with belgium is , that we , the dutch , use their roads en masse to get to france . 
  so all the dutch going on a holiday to the `` costa '' , do n't fuel the belgian economy , but still put a lot of pressure on their infrastructure . 
  why ? 
  too much like democracy ? 
   to pursue it is important that there is no discrimination between individual children from our side , this is crucial . 
  i 'd recon a similar issue with parents who want their child to eat only biological . 
  or sugar-free . 
  or vegetarian . 
  i know in . nl daycares are struggling a lot with such parents . 
  and indeed often choose to give all children the same . 
  so as to avoid one or two children having some pityfull poor lunch because of the ( religious ) delusions of their parents . 
  so , if something like `` only buying halal/kosjher '' is a simple solution to avoid mo and sharon from feeling different because their parents demand silly food-prescriptions that is a very ** pragmatic ** solution . 
  source gives little information on other reasons why they do this . 
  it ** does not say ** that other diets are not followed . 
  it only says that ** no discrimination ** is the reason . 
  note that i do n't agree with the sentiment at all : if you want your child to have some special diet based on religion or other misinformation , that 's fine : bring your child to places where they support your view of the world . 
  or fucking adjust . 
  and note that currently i think this problem is much bigger then the few halal and kosjer diets . 
  dutch parent are fucking retarded when it comes to organic , vegetarian , sugar-free , gluten-free and whatever . 
  sources or bullshit . 
  i 'm sorry tot hear you are currently living on the street . 
  how are your chances for a roof before winter starts ? 
  the entire function of that court , is to consider all there is to be considered . 
  if rules and laws were to applied literally and regardless , that court would not be needed . 
   rules need to be enforced and laws need to be respected . 
  but no . 
  not at all cost . 
  and not always . 
  rules are made by men , ( and , me being atheist and all : that includes all rules in all holy books too ) are never perfect , and situations change . 
  rules need to be questioned , stretched and stresstested . 
  laws need to be under continuous scrutiny and change . 
  a rule made yesterday is no longer relevant and might even hinder your society today . 
  a law made last year , is old , stale and might not even hold up anymore . 
  in other words : if your statement was followed always and everywhere , we would still be living under the first rules ever made , some thousands of years ago . 
  i doubt they were even written down . 
  but i do n't doubt they were stupid , ignorant , couterproductive and silly in todays society . 
  laws are there to be questioned , stretched and then changed by our ever-behind lawmakers : the politics . 
  laws are , by very definition , not absolute and never regardless : they have to consider cirumstances , situations , and persons . 
  a `` silly '' rule and law , dublinii brought us the current mess . 
  regardless on your stance on immigration , the current situation is crap and unholdable . 
  yet our `` rules and laws '' say it has to be exactly this way . 
  ( and no , i am not some silly punkrock anarchist ), 
   how can they be blamed ? 
  what i read in the entire thread , is not that the uk is to blame for all this , but that they had a big role in the current situation . 
  and yet take as little responsibility as possible ; hiding behind the agreements that `` country of first registration has to keep refugees '' and the fact their country has seas as borders . 
  which is their right . 
  but when such a country starts pointing at sweden and germany who * do * take their responsibility ( which they legally do n't have to do ) as being a `` bad influence '' for the region , one can point back that the uk does not take its reponsibilty ( which they legally do n't have to do ) . 
  it 's a pity they do n't list the canary islands , since la palma is where a huge oberservatory is located . 
  i 've never seen that many stars in my life , as from above the clouds in la palma . 
  you can always tell when a dutch supermarket , warehouse , franchize or brand open a branch in belgium , when the languages on their packaging go from one ( nl ) to three ( nl/be , fr , de ), 
  and the single lump `` plat l\u0117mburgs '' is actually a highly fractured group of dialects , even . 
  a person from venlo understands the dialect from , say reuver ( 2km ) bit certainly does not speak it . 
  and sometimes can not even understand a dialect from more south ( kerkraads e.g. ) . 
  source : i 'm limburger, 
  it says you may always pay with them . 
  it clearly states they have to accept it . 
  the belgian festival-season has almost started , so the yearly invasion of hollanders is near . 
  for the record : south holland is the most populous , followed by north holland and then brabant . 
  do n't forget parts of north holland and groningen `` are catholic '' too . 
  and brabant being the most populous province and being catholic may make this very well true . 
  also , reformed and protestant may not be considered one religion , but two . 
  which makes catholicism the largest of three . 
  in the netherlands `` pinda '' ( peanut ) is still used as a racist term to indicate dutch people with indonesian heritage . 
  its funny , because unknowingly , you sounded exactly like a racist dutchman . 
  ` bloody peanuts , coming here , taking jobs ` . 
  completely offtopic . 
  but fun tot see a fellow limburgian here with the same uberliburgian name . 
  though mine is spelled with the north limburgse \u00e8 instead of the \u00e6 . ho\u00eage vi\u00ebf . 
  in the end , the french redditors have payed for ( taxes ) and approved of ( by proxy of elected reps ) the action that rescued a dutch citizen . 
  some thanks is appropriate . 
  downvoting for whining about posts that whine about downvotes . 
  and mentioning it .
