  if you look beyond its message and its content , it truly is a cinematic masterpiece . 
  probably one of the best movies/documentaries in the propaganda genre . 
  you 'll see images and concepts reused in many popular movie ( star wars , lion king , gladiator , lord of the rings ) . 
  but , since its message and its content is so extremely deplorable , it is very hard to look beyond it . 
  and even harder to acclaim its artistic value . 
  i read an article recently , where someone calculated that it is cheaper to live in barcelona and fly to london every morning , then to live in london . 
  less suitable land ? 
  i 'm not an expert on farming , but the lowlands , being a large delta filled with clay , river slik and irrigated swamps pretty much makes extremely suitable farmland . 
  we 've pretty much wasted it with pig - , cow and chickenshit , by now , but overall , the ground itself and the climate is one of the best for farming . 
   designed driver you must have looked fabulous . 
  what are you doing , son ? 
  are you on drugs ? 
  no officer !, 
  i am burning weed , to show the dutch how much i hate them !, 
   just the basics like cheese , salami , bread etc. 
  your basics are not russian basics . 
  clearly . 
  just compare the prices on vodka , potatoes and cabbage . 
  [ squeezing oranges in protest ] ( https://www.middleeastobserver.org/2017/03/14/turks-squeeze-oranges-drink-juice-in-anti-dutch-protest/ ) is all fine . 
  real turks take a basball bat to their mercedes slk !, 
  ad and telegraaf can be bad , too . 
  not as flagrant as the daily mail or the sun headlines that get your attention . 
  but still quite bad . 
  just [ search ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=telegraaf+voorpaginas&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=http%3a%2f%2fwww.voc-nederland.org%2fwp-content%2fuloads%2fkiezersbedrog_vvd_telegraaf_26-10-2012.jpg ), 
  what is the printed version of clickbait called ? 
  pageturnerbait ? 
   in the medium term it will probably be the financial industry leaving for europe . 
  and it . 
  username checks out . 
  stokholm , vienna , prague , berlin , all not typically `` west '' , yet good places to live , just to name a few . 
  and even if you are thinking more about places like poznan or ljubljana , those are catching up rapidly . 
  just compare riga , letland with another ex-ussr-state capital like tblisi , georgia , and you can see how well the eu is actually helping the states grow and become better places . 
  autocorrect , fixed . 
  fair point . 
  but in that case , would turks themselves not fall under such a classification ? 
  edit : autocorrect, 
  since when is `` since the 1970 's '' and `` after 1980 '' not modern ? 
  but , sure , here you go , 1994 . 
  officially protected death squads are accused of disappearance of 3,200 kurds and assyrians in 1993 and 1994 in the so-called `` mystery killings '' . 
  kurdish politicians , human-rights activists , journalists , teachers and other members of intelligentsia were among the victims . 
  virtually none of the perpetrators were investigated nor punished . 
  turkish government also encouraged islamic extremist group hezbollah to assassinate suspected pkk members and often ordinary kurds . 
  [ 163 ] azimet k\u00f6yl\u00fco\u011flu , the state minister of human rights , revealed the extent of security forces ' excesses in autumn 1994 : while acts of terrorism in other regions are done by the pkk ; in tunceli it is state terrorism . 
  in tunceli , it is the state that is evacuating and burning villages . 
  in the southeast there are two million people left homeless . 
   starts not only doing the very thing we mocked erdogan for , this is what the article is about : point out the hypocrisy . 
  the article does not hold `` all turks '' or even `` the turkish state '' accountable for their history . 
  it merely points out that when erdohan starts blaming citizens for their history , he should be very aware of his own history too . 
  one that is often denied , forgotten and pushed away . 
  i get where this comes from , but this is quite a stretch from the literal words ( without context ) expressed by erdohan :  `` if europe continues this way , no european in any part of the world can walk safely on the streets . 
  europe will be damaged by this . 
  we , as turkey , call on europe to respect human rights and democracy whatever he really means , it is clearly a threat . 
  but not even close to `` wanting to kill an entire race of people '' . 
  `` europeans '' are not a race . 
  he never mentioned to kill anyone . 
  and nowhere did he even hint at this applying to `` entire '' europe . 
  sure , this can only be intepreted as some kind of threat . 
  but your interpretation is way , way off . 
   i 'd love to see evidence of systematic oppression of kurds though . 
  ok . that 's what is causing the downvotes . 
  either , you are na\u00efve , or your internet is a different internet . 
  * following the military coup of 1980 , the kurdish language was officially prohibited in public and private life : http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/magazine/17turkey-t.html?ex=1361854800&amp;en=df64cf85326e2103&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink * many people who spoke , published , or sang in kurdish were arrested and imprisoned : https://books.google.nl/books?id=8mtvbgaaqbaj&amp;redir_esc=y * the kurds are still not allowed to get a primary education in their mother tongue and they do n't have a right to self-determination , even though turkey has signed the iccpr . 
  there is ongoing discrimination against and `` otherization '' of kurds in society : https://books.google.nl/books?id=wtawbqaaqbaj&amp;redir_esc=y * since the 1970s , the european court of human rights has condemned turkey for the thousands of human rights abuses . 
  [ 149 ] [ 153 ] the judgments are related to executions of kurdish civilians , [ 150 ] torturing , [ 154 ] forced displacements [ 155 ] systematic destruction of villages , [ 156 ] arbitrary arrests [ 157 ] murdered and disappeared kurdish journalists . 
  [ 158 ] these are what i found after 10 minutes on google and wikipedia . 
  i am certain people studying this in detail , will be able to get even more `` evidence '' for you . 
  i think i found the french guy . 
  germany already has these laws in place . 
  just that currently they can only go after the `` source '' and not the `` distributer '' . 
  this merely changes that part . 
  everything else is in place already and already used . 
  so , no . 
  there wo n't necessarily be more cases . 
  about 3 % of employment is directly in agrculture in the netherlands . 
  but my point was especially about the network effect . 
  which includes processing of food , selling it and distributing it . 
  so everything from supermarkets selling vegetables to factories making butchersknives , via consultants making software for management of animal food . 
   ( though that 'll employ a tiny ammount of people compared to the total population ) do n't underestimate the network-effect of agriculture . 
  sure , herding 10 cows in a meadow requires one lazy person lying in the shadow for a day . 
  but then you have veterinaries , builders , contstruction workers , machine - operators and technicians , and all the supporting people on one side . 
  while on the other side you have truckdrivers fetching milk , factories making dairy , slaughterhouses , tanners , more truckdrivers and salesmen and so on , on the other side . 
  in many countries , even a heavy industrilaised one like the netherlands , agriculture as a whole is by far the largest employer . 
  you 've had -20 in the netherlands ? 
  what year was that , 1944 ? 
  it never gets that cold here . 
  thai do this too . 
  so i suspect it * is * an more common asian thing . 
  i do want that . 
  untill all the `` variety '' is but a line in the portfolio of kraft foods ( or unilever ) . 
  i am not - at all - a socialist lover ( i firmly beleive in true liberalism ) . 
  but when a supermarket is but a illusion of choice between the entire portfolio of kraft foods , we are truly fucked . 
  you triggered my pet peeve . 
  should work for english too . 
  where , like in dutch , `` to shop around '' means grabbing the cheapest everywhere . 
  * gradually shifting * is the keyphrase here . 
  multinationals have branches in multiple nations . 
  most often it is not a matter of `` let 's move our one single office from here to there '' , but a slow down in one place and more hiring , buying , and expansion in another place . 
  do you see the red clumps around nijmegen and maastricht ? 
  it 's not flat there . 
  well , a swiss person would consider it flat , sure .
