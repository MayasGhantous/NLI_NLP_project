  serbia current president denies that it was a genocide and refuses to pay respect to the victims . 
  this says enough that there 's no `` only '' a portion that supports the genocide in srebrenica . 
  there 's only a portion of serbs willingly to accept guilt , but the majority definitely does n't . 
  what you are doing is clearly whataboutism . 
  and that you do n't say anything about the context , only shows more that you want to put the blame only on the dutchbat . 
  it was agreed that all men would be pow ( and thus not being shot to death ) and that women and children were given transport to other enclaves . 
  both the serbian government of now and serbs are fully supporting mladic and many other war criminals . 
  together with still no apology about what happened , it 's still fully justified to point at nowadays serbs . 
  ooh fuck off . 
  your air force were being pussies together with teh french and the english . 
  but you do n't want to see that , so you push of the blame . 
  are you braindead ? 
  you would be surprised how strong concrete bunkers can be . 
  look at the d-day landings and several ww1 battles . 
  yprs , which are dutch produced m113 . 
  they were armed with .50 s. 
  you are only trying to let the serb sound reasonable while they were actively committing war crimes . 
  according to wikipedia they had also field guns and concrete bunkers and the area was good for teh defenders . 
  meanwhile the dutch had 0 ( ! ), 
  at or artillery capabilities . 
  they did n't have any heavy bunkers or favorable terrain . 
  and yes you are demanding their deaths by thinking they could have a chance in protecting the civilians . 
  but the fact is that at least a large part of civilians could flee because of the dutch surrender . 
  it they would have fought , everyone would have died . 
  everyone . 
  that 's why i say that they would have fought for nothing . 
  so you do n't know what you would have done and you still demand their deaths . 
  please explain to me how you would have fend of tanks and artillery with only machineguns . 
  and how you would have defended civilians from an all destroying artillery bombardment with only machineguns . 
  no that 's not reality . 
  the reality was that serbs just wanted to kill anyone not serb . 
  that has nothing to do with the `` violence of the islam '' . 
  the un was responsible for the order that no air attacks were allowed . 
  the un was responsible for promising non existing air support . 
  the un was responsible for not punishing the french and the english refusing air support . 
  the un was responsible for the hideous roe . 
  you are not expecting sense of duty , courage or integrity of soldiers . 
  you are demanding their death for nothing . 
  what the hell ? 
  ooh fuck off . 
  you are the one here demanding the death of 600 soldiers , not me . 
  i at least expect from you that you have to been in a similar position as those soldiers . 
  because i am pretty certain that you would n't have demanded their death if you have been in such position . 
  and have you read my other comments ? 
  than you would have known that i do n't make excuses for anything that higher ups did . 
  i only do n't blame anyone , including karremans , who were on the ground there at that time in srebrenica . 
  no not greater the responsibility . 
  the greatest responsibility for this disaster still lays with the serbs . 
  but yes the un , france , english and dutch governments are also in smaller extent responsible for this disaster . 
  i think it 's okay to sue the dutch ** state ** about this . 
  to bad you ca n't sue the un . 
  it was the dutch ** state ** and the un that send the dutch ** military ** in such bad state to srebrenica . 
  the fact that mladic was actively protected by serbs and the serbian government until his arrest tells a lot . 
  i would say they would have died for nothing if they would have put on a fight . 
  it 's easy to demand someone else death if you are sitting in an office chair behind a computer . 
  have you see the video that was shot at that meeting ? 
  did you see how uncomfortable karremans ( commander of dutchbat iii ) was ? 
  but it 's always easier to sit in your office chair and proclaiming proudly that you singlehandedly could have done it better . 
  fyi shadowbanned can only be done by admins , not mods . 
  so you know nothing about what ever really happened . 
  you mean the time it almost got overrun by alt-right racists ? 
  well than the shut the fuck up on how dutchbat could have done better . 
  well than blame the dutch state and the un . 
  not dutchbat itself . 
  it was the dutch state and the un that let dutchbat be in that bad state . 
  not the soldiers themselves . 
  everything can be a slippery slope . 
  you have no chance to do anything if you only have some machine guns versus multiple tanks and ( heavy ) artillery . 
  also please explain to us how you would fight a tank with only a machine gun . 
  it may not have if it was only infantry vs infantry . 
  however you are ignoring the fact that serbs were placing tanks and ( heavy ) artillery in place . 
  it would only have lead into a slaughter of dutch soldiers and bosnian civilians . 
  that was holocaust denial . 
  seems so , sadly not on the real criminals . 
  really dude ? 
  really ? 
  iirc if you buy stuff from an eu country , you pay their vat . 
  if you buy from outside the eu ( without exemptions ) you pay at least your own countries vat . 
  and in some cases also the vat of the original country . 
  well the same can be said about the poles . 
  nope it is the uk that 's being difficult . 
  also until those negotiations are done , only then the uk is out of the eu . 
  it has n't pulled out yet . 
  it 's the uk that pulled out . 
  saying that it 's the eu fault is like falling over a rock and saying that someone pushed you, 
  what are you smoking ? 
   the eu want unlimited and unrestricted rights for eu citizens in the uk with nothing in return . 
  even the unemployed feckless ones and the same goes for uk citizens going to other eu countries . 
  also goes for companies . 
   the eu want a lump sum from us for us to leave but does n't want to pay out on the infrastructure and projects we invested in . 
  there are projects in the uk that are receiving eu funding . 
  but 's it 's bullshit to expect more from the eu than giving to the eu as a rich country . 
   the eu wo n't let us negotiate trade deal outside of the eu before we leave , which puts us in a shit position when brexit is finalised . 
  well that 's something was very clear from the beginning . 
  what the uk could have done is just pull out without negotiations with the eu . 
  however that would destroy the uk as everything eu related will be nullified . 
   but we take back ** our ** territorial waters and it 's us doing things the hard way ? 
  emphasis and fixing the type error mine . 
  do you really think you can do anything in territorial waters without affecting other countries territorial waters ? 
  israel not being assholes and recognize that they are the ones doing illegal things .
