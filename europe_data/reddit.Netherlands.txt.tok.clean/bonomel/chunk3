  feyenoord ( dutch football club ) hooligans damaged that fountain in rome a couple of years ago . 
  he only talked about islam and our labour party . 
  he still wants a nexit though , because he stated '' that a nexit would be the best thing that could happen to us '' yesterday . 
  i do n't think this is an accurate poll , because all the other polls have pvv at ~ 23 seats ( 16 % ) . 
  i would be fairly happy with this result , though . 
  these are predictions based on a peil.nl poll conducted on march 12th ( 3 days before the election ) .

  google translate :  martin schulz has been a chancellor candidate for the spd for less than two weeks . 
  now the social democrats have surpassed the union in a survey . 
  this has never been the case in the insa survey . 
   this was last more than six years ago : the spd is one percentage point ahead of the union in the sunday trend of the opinion research institute insa . 
   the cdu and the csu are 30 per cent agreeable in the current survey , while the spd is on the other hand 31 per cent . 
   the left can also pick up a point ( 10 percent ) , but the greens lose two percentage points and only reach 7 percent . 
  fdp and afd remain unchanged at 6 and 12 percent , respectively . 
   responding to the backlog in the survey , chancellor angela merkel , on the sidelines of the press conference with csu boss horst seehofer , said that she had respected and respected each of her social-democratic opponents . 
  `` this is no different with martin schulz , '' said the cdu chairman . 
   schulz ensures spd high-flying  since the nomination of martin schulz to the chancellor candidate , the spd can look forward to significantly rising survey results . 
   never could the social democrats at insa land in a survey before the union . 
  however , the opinion research institute also only surveys surveys since 2012 . 
   in other institutes , too , one has to look very far back to find such a constellation . 
  at the allensbach institute , the spd was able to land in front of the union last august ( spd : 32 % , cdu / csu : 31 % ) . 
  emnid identified an spd leadership last november 2006 ( spd : 30 percent , cdu / csu : 29 percent ) . 
   already on sunday the spd was shot up by six points to 29 percent in an `` emnid '' survey for the `` bild am sonntag '' . 
  the union also lost four points to 33 percent . 
   also at chancellor direct election at the front  the gap between the two parties at emnid was as low as last 2012 . 
  other surveys have been similar in the past few days . 
   in the chancellor 's question , too , schulz was able to override the chancellor . 
  in a chancellor 's direct election , 50 per cent of the interviewees would vote for schulz , only 34 per cent for merkel . 
   the german trend of infratest dimap came to this conclusion on behalf of the ard `` tagesthemen '' and the `` welt '' at the end of last week . 
  i do n't really see why schulz can defend europe better than merkel , who is very pro-eu too . 
  that 's almost impossible as long as the people with two passports ( even that is not always the case with dutch morroccans ) do n't want to lose it . 
  the referendum was hijacked by ( mostly ) right-wing populist who wanted to damage the eu and the traditional parties . 
  the ukraine treaty was n't really important to the voters , they just wanted to make a signal that they disapproved the current eu and the policies of the traditional parties . 
  people like geert wilders saw this as an opportunity to gain momentum for anti-eu and above all anti-establishment sentiment . 
  they knew our government could n't just listen to the ( already likely ) no vote due to the structure of the eu and geopolitical relations . 
  the referendum was a farce for both the establishment and the anti-establishment parties . 
  the establischment parties have suffered electorally from the result , and the anti-establishment blew up their opportunity for binding referenda in the future , as most of the ( prior to the ukraine referendum ) pro-referenda parties have given up their pro-referenda position . 
  google translate :  the afd politician bj\u00f6rn h\u00f6cke expresses crude demands : dresden as the federal capital and the end of the commemoration of jews killed . 
  `` i want you as a new prussian , '' the thuringian afd faction chairman bj\u00f6rn h\u00f6cke calls his audience in dresden on tuesday evening . 
  invited was the young alternative ( yes ) , the youth association of the afd . 
   h\u00f6cke is the highlight of the evening in the ballroom of the brauhauses watzke . 
  frenetically he is received and even more cheered , the 44-year-old is released from the lectern . 
  instead of the jews and other persecutors of the nazi regime , when it came to h\u00f6cke , the german victims of the second world war are finally to be thought of . 
   `` we will return germany bit by bit ''  he had an uncomfortable speaker who afd man says at the beginning of his speech about themselves . 
  dresden is for him the `` capital of mutb\u00fcrger '' that would actually be the capital of germany . 
  more and more his tone increases . 
  the government is a regime , says h\u00f6cke , that the bundeswehr was a multiculturalized intervention group at the service of the us and the german people elementally threatened . 
  racist theorist bj\u00f6rn h\u00f6cke sees germany and its social peace threatened by `` importing foreign peoples '' . 
   the thuringian members of the landtag are gradually increasing the slowly growing threat of drought . 
  only the afd could save germany still , promises h\u00f6cke the audience . 
  but , `` we will return to germany bit by bit . '', 
  he does not say exactly how this is going to happen , but believes that his party is the `` last peaceful opportunity '' . 
   h\u00f6cke : `` country needs complete victory of afd ''  in the middle of the speech , the foreign policy expert outlines his ideas of a party . 
  according to h\u00f6cke , the afd must always remain a `` fundamental-oppositional movement party '' and must not lose contact with friendly citizens ' movements . 
  even if it is represented in parliament , it must remain a movement group and maintain a lot of contact with its citizens . 
   `` we will be able to last until we reach 51 percent , '' promises h\u00f6cke . 
  the only alternative : as a senior partner of an `` old party '' came to power , this party must have changed however strongly . 
  `` this country needs a complete victory of the afd , '' h\u00f6cke cries to his audience in the hall . 
   holocaust memorial is for caves `` monument of shame ''  his tone changes again in the third part of the speech . 
  here the thuringian is somewhat quieter , but sharper in tone . 
  the bombing of dresden , the 44-year-old , is a war crimes , comparable to the atomic bombs at hiroshima and nagasaki . 
  in his opinion , the allies wanted `` with the bombardment of the german cities nothing but robbing us of our collective identity . '', 
  in the alleged reference to denazification , the afd man , who stands for the national wing of his party , says that `` it was almost possible to '' with the reformation `` begun after 1945 . 
   `` to date , we are not able to mourn our own victims , '' says h\u00f6cke . 
  `` the germans are the only people in the world to plant a monument of disgrace in their capital , '' says the afd man contemptuously about the holocaust memorial in the center of berlin . 
  for this sentence , there is little cheering , as can be seen in the video of the right `` compact '' magazine . 
   federal council of the bundestag speaks of `` debt cult ''  the thuringian , now becomes clear , wants another historiography , for up to now german history has always been made lousy and ridiculous . 
  if the afd came to power , the history books should be rewritten . 
  `` this ridiculous coping policy paralyzes us . 
  we need a turn-of-the-century turnaround by 180 degrees , `` says h\u00f6cke at the end of his speech . 
  in the future , instead of the jews and other persecutors of the nazi regime , only the german victims would be thought of . 
   the speech of former speaker jens maier was similar . 
  the afghan parliamentary candidate for dresden declared that the `` culprit had to be finally ended '' . 
  this meant the memory of the holocaust and its millions of victims . 
   brexit plan :  - exit single market - leave european court of justice - immigration control - parliament vote that 's a pretty hard brexit , but i guess it 's fair since the british people voted to leave the eu . 
  it would have been weird when the uk decided to leave the eu but remain in the eea , because eea is almost exactly the same as the eu . 
  i hope the eu can make a fair deal with the uk , without giving the uk the benefits of being in the single market and prevent them from cherry-picking the things they like . 
  our government ( nl ) still has to ratify the association treatment , so frankly this should n't be a surprise . 
   dutch ceta referendum oh god , not that shit again . 
  i do n't think it 'll make it to a referendum , though . 
   pvv is polling like 25-30 % no , he is polling 15-20 % and i think that number will go down . 
  first of all , our pm and his cabinet did n't prosecute him , nor did they say he should be prosecuted for his speech . 
  but you 're right regarding our om ( prosecution ) : they 've led themselves into this mess . 
  edit : grammar, 
   dutch prosecutors demanded on thursday that opposition leader geert wilders be fined 5,000 euros ( $ 5,400 ) on charges of hate speech and discrimination . 
  no prison sentence was sought . 
   wilders faces charges of discrimination and inciting racial hatred at a rally in 2014 , where he led supporters in chanting they wanted fewer moroccans in the netherlands . 
  he denies wrongdoing . 
  this whole thing is turning out to be one big joke . 
  wilders uses this trial as an instrument to let us show that '' our government is behind this '' . 
  he has got free media to push his anti-establishment/anti-government/anti-islam agenda . 
  nb : i did n't think he should 've been procecuted in the first place-i highly value freedom of speech-but this is a victory for him and his party in all ways imaginable . 
  is n't fidesz already doing that ? 
  i doubt the csu would be willing to accept die gr\u00fcne as a junior coalition partner . 
  they are eachothers counterparts and their electorate wo n't be happy to see their party with the other , which has a complete different view of policies . 
  she probably will win , as the only other party that has a small shot in becoming the winner ( spd ) is a mess with a weak leader . 
  the other parties ( afd/linke/gr \u00fcnen / fdp ) are currently all to small to even think about winning . 
  polls [ show ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_next_german_federal_election ) us a comfortable 10 points lead over the spd and a 20 points lead over the afd/gr \u00fcne / left, 
  this is n't a surprise as she is still the best candidate for the cdu/csu ( if the latter accepts her ) and germany , i think . 
  well , globalisation comes with winners and losers .
