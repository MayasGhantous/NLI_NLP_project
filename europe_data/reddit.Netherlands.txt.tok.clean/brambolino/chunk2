  rofl , wilders is a political coward . 
  he says all this reality twisting fucked up shit that our mentally handicapped happily nod their head to in agreement because they think it somehow nicely encapsulates their bigotry , which of course they mistakenly identify as ` what they think but could n't say ' . 
  he then continues to regurgitate said shit in parliament , and nobody can really respond to it because it 's so out of place and full of shit . 
  even when he had a chance to influence policy , he did n't really get much done and walked away like an angry school child . 
  either the pvv is just actually incredibly unintelligent , and they themselves do n't even know what it is they want ( or ca n't constructively formulate it ) , or everything they say is just a strategy to win votes from stupid people for foreign benefactors whose actual political interests are undisclosed . 
  wilders deliberately paints turkey as an islamic republic with `` values incompatible to ours '' , even though turkey is ( very ) devided on whether they want an islamist dictator or a liberal democracy . 
  why does he feel the need to take such an inimical stance ? 
  see previous paragraph . 
  thanks for your support , but sadly wilders is just as much of a grade-a lunatic as erdogan ... so i 'd rather not have him control my country . 
  i feel like the word ` for ' takes the perfect tense only when the action is still going on . 
  in your first example `` i was gone for six weeks . '', 
  sounds more correct if you 're back now . 
  maybe it 's just because the verb phrase ` to be gone ' has a continuous aspect to it ( normally expressed using to be + gerund ) * `` i 've lived here for 20 years '' -  ( and still do ) * `` i lived here for 20 years '' -  ( i live somewhere else now ) . 
  * `` i 've been living here for 20 years -  ( and still do ) strangely , changing ` here ' to ` there ' makes the first one ambiguous with regard to whether the person still lives there , and the continuous tense can be used to clarify . 
  english is weird . 
  well , if it 's really walruses we 're fucked . 
  yes , and if not that , 9/11 . 
  they could be one of those estonian russians ? 
  ahh man get off him , he 's only american . 
  wtf is god 's light . 
  how can i see it if i do n't know what it looks like . 
  you can give me some vague `` end-all-be-all '' stuff that nobody can really disagree with , but at that point you 'd also have lost all the specifics of what you _ actually _ mean with what you say to want . 
  i thought it was like dutch , especially the shorter words of germanic origin . 
  the differences between english and dutch are mostly regular ( like word order ) , and therefore obvious . 
  it became easy to sound ` proper ' quite quickly . 
  well , to be fair ( to me haha ) , standard dutch grew out of the big purple blob on that map , which is low franconian . 
  the light yellow colour represents low saxon languages which form dialect continua into the netherlands . 
  it had in this way also an influence on standard dutch , but later on this standard language in turn influenced the lower saxon languages in the netherlands ( more drastically every generation ) . 
  so it 's a bit more complicated than a `` smooth transition '' . 
  standard dutch is pretty distinct from whatever you 'd hear across the border , but a lot less distinct from anything in the netherlands becaue of the asymmetry between the influence of `` low saxon '' on `` dutch '' and of `` dutch '' on `` low saxon in the netherlands '' . 
  of course we 're talking closely related languages here , so dutch is indeed pretty close to low saxon genetically , and only slightly farther removed from high german . 
  it is , however , a direct descendant of franconian and not of low saxon . 
  there definitely is a belgian dutch standard , but it is n't really different from netherlandic dutch as it 's pretty much only word usage that is different . 
  i think `` flemish '' is just an umbrella term for any and all dialects spoken in flanders , including the belgian standard for standard dutch . 
  tl ; dr all of lithuania, 
  i see a lot of people say ` blijf ik vrij onverveerd ' as well . 
  i thought europeans were the elfs on fantasyland earth . 
  well , ` diets ' literally means ` the people 's language ' . 
  it 's cognate to ` deutsch ' , and `` dutch '' is just the anglization . 
  i occasionally struggle with walk , talk , etc. 
  also squirrel , world . 
  the netherlands is so small that you can reach anywhere from anywhere by train in 4 hours or less , but the average commute between major cities will be around the 1.5 hour mark . 
  even a journey like groningen ( a city in the `` far '' north ) - amsterdam barely takes 2 hours . 
  there used to be one domestic flight between amsterdam and maastricht ( city in the far southern tip of limburg province . 
  it 's a lot faster on paper , because the train takes 2.5 hours , but the hassle of having to go to the airport , checking in , going through security and all that was too much of a hurdle for it to remain profitable . 
  as for international trips ... 
  the netherlands is ideally located for train trips , and people here benefit from both the belgian/french tgv lines and the german ausbau/neubaustrecken . 
  amsterdam-paris takes just over 3 hours and can go as cheap as 35 euros one-way . 
  flights are almost always more expensive for these distances . 
  it 's perfectly possible to take the train to anywhere further ( amsterdam-barcelona ~ 1200km in 10 hours , for example ) , but once the distance is more than 800km , the low-cost airlines start to take over the market . 
  recently , international buses have also been getting more popular . 
  but despite being ( very ) cheap , i do n't know many people who would n't pay a tenner extra to not feel uncomfortable and car sick for 5-10 hours . 
  i do n't understand multiculturalism as a ` system ' per se , but rather as a necessary step ( the nicest one anyway ) towards a society of getting along . 
  if you 're the type to take a train to the continent , you could take the eurostar to brussels , then an ice train to cologne , and then a regional train to kyllburg ( close to malberg ) . 
  there seem to be about 2 feasible connections per day , taking 7-8 hours . 
  you can check for yourself at [ http://hafas.bene-system.com] ( http://hafas.bene-system.com/bin/query.exe/en?l=ns_hispeed ), 
  that was my point , yes . 
  our debit cards do n't have codes on them for some reason . 
  ah ok . too bad . 
  [ buda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buda,_kortrijk ) looks nice still . 
  i got the idea from op 's wording he literally meant _ any _ kind of island . 
  ~ ~ [ outremeuse ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/outremeuse ) is an island . ~ ~ edit : that 's one of the five great belgian islands . 
  the other ones are buda , monsin , testerep , and the \u00cele de dave , edit 2 : monsin appears to be artificial , and testerep does n't exist anymore ... so make that one of the three . 
  edit 3 : outremeuse is also artifical . 
  i 've never been to any of the [ waddeneilanden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/waddeneilanden ) . 
  i suppose a lot of the netherlands is actually artificial ` islands ' , like the [ flevopolder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flevopolder ) , and many neighborhoods of amsterdam . 
  if we 're just counting natural islands : * [ marken ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marken ) ( now connected by a dyke to the rest of north holland ) * [ walcheren ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/walcheren ) and [ zuid-beveland ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/zuid-beveland ) , both in the province of zeeland . 
  since the [ great flood of 1953 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_sea_flood_of_1953 ) and the [ delta works ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delta_works ) that followed , they are now separated by canals and moats instead of natural waterways . 
  * [ venice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venice ) and the [ lido di venezia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lido_di_venezia ) * [ corfu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corfu ) west of greece . 
  * [ illa de ons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ons_island ) off the coast of galicia , es . 
  and i guess the [ \u00cele de la cit\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%8ele_de_la_cit%c3%a9 ) was also natural at one point . 
  and of course the island-nations gb , ie and is . 
  i really do n't think it 's islam that 's influencing our becoming more prudish . 
  i did n't understand the trinity to begin with , so that 's fine . 
  same in dutch ( unsurprisingly ) : `` mijn vriend ( in ) '' vs `` een vriend ( in ) '' vaste vriend ( in ), 
  leave it to the french to give pompous names to simple things . 
  does n't that scale only apply to things that contain capsaicin ? 
  i do n't think mustard is hot because of capsaicin . 
  sov verb 2nd for life brah, 
  how can a train run to a made-up place ? 
   completely oblivious to the world going around them which is odd , because , as tourists , should n't that be their primary concern ? 
  well , people say this about the dutch labour party ( pvda ) . 
  i 'm always quite pleased when germans/french/whatever try to speak to me in their native tongues . 
  gives me a chance to practice !, 
  and if it does n't work out , welp , english . 
  there is an additional thing at work here . 
  < g  was originally a voiced velar fricative [ \u0263 ] ( as opposed to < ch  , which is always unvoiced [ x ] ) . 
  like all voiced consonants , however , g gets unvoiced at the end of a syllable . 
  nowadays , many people from the _ west _ just always use the voiceless variant , while in the _ east _ they still sometimes say [ \u0263 ] . 
  again , this is a different thing than the usual hard-g/soft-g north-south divide . 
  in the south , the voiced-unvoiced pair is [ \u029d ] / [ \u00e7 ] . 
  i only knew because i looked it up at some point ... the spelling only makes sense once you realize that a dashed l is a w , and a w is a v. 
  haha, 
  i think they meant the polish cities . 
  i 'd probably say `` vratswaf '' and not `` breslau '' , but i 'd definitely say `` stettin '' over `` shtshshtetschin '' ... obviously . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i thought it had something to do with fisheries ? 
  oh , the dutch could never do anything bad . 
  who are you to tell us about our problems anyway ? 
  you make so many assumptions .
