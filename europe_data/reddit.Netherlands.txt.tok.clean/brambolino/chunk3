  of course i know what spain is . 
  i 'm not an idiot . 
  i 've traveled through pretty much all of spain . 
  i understand what the different areas are like . 
  i also know a thing or two about nationalism , and i know english . 
   there is only 23 % of the basques that want the independence , which means that 77 % of the basques consider themselves spanish . 
  ` not wanting independence ' does not equal ` considering yourself spanish ' . 
  i only said that when 100 % of a region 's inhabitants think of themselves as exclusively < insert national identity here  , it 's pretty damn clear that they are n't themselves a nation . 
  let 's talk about limburgers : even though they 're dutch , they sometimes consider the province of limburg their ` vaderland ' . 
  if one of them wanted to mention something about limburg during holy roman times , for example , i would n't be at their throats to tell them that `` limburg isnt a country stfu '' , which is basically what you did . 
  i said it multiple times : it comes down to whether or not a person thinks that basques constitute a nation . 
  clearly this person thinks about his country this way . 
  it has nothing to do with spanish sovereignty , or with whether people also think of themselves as spanish/basque/whatever . 
  and you still seem to think `` country '' exclusively means `` independent nation state '' ... 
  if i were you i 'd rethink what i knew . 
  zeelanders and drentenaren are n't nations . 
  they universally consider themselves dutch . 
  do n't push me now ... 
  there is no official definition that everyone always abides by . 
  the point is that this basque person calls his country a country , and that it 's perfectly understandable why . 
  you even said it yourself by mentioning the original translation from the basque . 
  to be honest , it seems that you are only making a fuss because you dislike the idea that basques are a nation . 
  which is fine , we can debate that if you want . 
  the word `` nation '' is fuzzy . 
  but do n't go around telling other people that they 're wrong in calling something something when it 's clearly not that simple . 
  i 'm not really interested in official definitions . 
  the word `` country '' can mean anything from what you say ( nation state ) , to `` my homeland '' . 
  read the second paragraph in my previous comment . 
  clearly the basque person you `` corrected '' was using the word to mean `` country '' in the ( in this case ) basque sense . 
  ( the territory of the basques ) . 
  the oxford definition actually works fine here , but also : dictionary.com : 2 the territory of a nation . 
  wiktionary : 2 a set region of land having particular human occupation or agreed limits , especially inhabited by members of the same race , language speakers etc. , or associated with a given person , occupation , species etc. 
  3 the territory of a nation , ** especially ** an independent nation state or formerly independent nation ; a political entity asserting ultimate authority over a geographical area . 
  you are confused about what the word `` country '' means . 
  it is n't necessarily synonymous with `` independent nation state '' . 
  what would you call wales ? 
  it 's a country , to be sure , but perhaps you would like to call it a `` region '' ? 
  i realize the basque country has a de jure definition in the framework of the spanish state ( autonomous community ) , and also one that encompasses the entire basque region . 
  in any case , it 's a bit odd to come up to a basque person who calls their country a country to say that he 's wrong . 
  if that person operates under the supposition that the basques are a nation , then he 's entirely correct in labelling the basque country as `` the territory of the basque nation '' , or in other words , a country . 
  i never heard of h being weird . 
  it 's even less harsh than in english . 
  i guess g takes some getting used to . 
  is n't ij just ` ej ' ? 
  your d 's are like l 's . 
  very strange . 
  first step : ** www.seat61.com ** it can give you a recommended route for travel between many major european cities ( look for the dropdown that says `` travel within europe '' ) . 
  it then lists how long in advance you should buy tickets for the cheap fares , and where to book , what the trains are like , etc. 
  very recommended !, 
  avoid raileurope like the plague . 
  its fares are marked up significantly , and it wo n't have some of the lower fares at all . 
  it 's a country . 
  not an independent nation state , or what you seem to think `` country '' means , however . 
  as for the language - just remove the potato and pronounce d 's correctly , and you 're good to go . 
  i think one flair should take prominence over a secondary one in design . 
  from the kids from room 402 , i learned that all you eat is blinis and borscht . 
  with ideologies and philosophies there is always interpretation . 
  by the writer , and then by the reader . 
  religions , however , bind a person to the ideology itself , and not to the interpretation , even though they are people and obviously have to interpret everything . 
  of course this does n't mean you ca n't say anything about it ( we have language for these kinds of things ) , but you 're just never ever going to separate the religion from the people that practice it . 
  they are the visible sign . 
  i 'm just saying that your `` being against the ideology and not the person '' trick is silly and does n't really work for religions . 
  and of course christophobia . 
  very legitimate . 
  i remember coming across some in spain , with usa flags and branding . 
  to me , mountains still look entirely fantastical . 
   wooing night intention how has this come to pass ? 
  i certainly did ( with [ these ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/schoonschrift.jpg ) kinds of templates ) , but i have no idea about the situation nowadays . 
  i found the public transport in france especially well run , also in the tourist centres in the countryside . 
  [ #boos ( mad ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucc0khafeizm6piqyrsc5lyg ) is quite big in the netherlands right now . 
  only [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpxazsgmkvq&amp;list=pl2c9e_du0usczllxjd0k_hnewmtgvdmal&amp;index=5 ) seems to have english subtitles though . 
  a lot of american youtubers are well aware that their audience is n't exclusively american , although this does take a certain type . 
  i think the vidcon crowd is pretty good at internationalization . 
  which one is the real one again ? 
  how much of that cake to get a noticable high ? 
  how 's that rail baltica coming along ? 
  i 'll come visit when it 's done k, 
  you should just be able to glance-read the subs though ... 
  i do n't mind being addressed in german at all . 
  if that 's what they speak , and if they can make themselves understood with it , i 'm happy to help . 
  i think most dutch people who understand german would . 
  it 'd be another thing entirely if people thought i _ was _ german , but this is just about language . 
  also , not everyone speaks english to the same level as they speak spanish . 
  i speak spanish , not portuguese . 
  you 'll probably understand perfectly well and i 'll even let you reply in portuguese if you want . 
  but hey , making myself understood is not the important part , it 's your inferiority complex that counts . 
  yea , it is n't like in other countries , where people who want a ` higher level ' school will always need a more expensive private school . 
  here , our public funded vwo suits those people 's needs just fine . 
  wow sorry but that is dreadful . 
  maybe they were going for dreadful idk dan nog liever `` i 'm european '', 
  so if you want to go da vinci mode and do science and get some cultural baggage with latin , you ca n't ? 
   traditionally they used to offer latin and ancient greek as well and many still do ( latin at least ) , but pretty much nobody takes ancient greek and latin has been getting really unpopular in the last few years and is getting replaced by spanish more and more . 
  in dutch gymnasia latin and/or ancient greek is mandatory . 
  else , it would n't be a gymnasium . 
  they 're public schools , and very popular . 
  fluent in : dutch , english able to hold simple conversations in : french , german , spanish in dutch vwo we get dutch and english , and french and german until the 4th year of secondary school ( ~ age 16 ) . 
  after that you can pick . 
  some schools allow you to pick spanish and/or advanced english as well . 
  gymnasia add on latin and ancient greek . 
  almost everyone in the regions occupied by germany suffered from the nazi regime .
