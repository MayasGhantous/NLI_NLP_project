  in europe this memory lingers . 
  maybe to you , hitler is this abstract personification of ultimate evil , but to europeans , he was a real guy , with a real ideology that had real consequences . 
  it 's not about isolationism vs imperialism , as your article paints it . 
  it 's about far-right xenophobic ideology . 
  i agree that the distinction is important , but imperialism and mass murder are n't the only criteria by which you can compare something to hitler , especially in a reddit comment . 
   what a lovely word by the way , we say naturwissenschaft . 
  more often called * b\u00e8tavakken * `` beta-f\u00e4cher '' . 
  guess why i chose the other word  early on my maths grades were terrible , but at some point i just started getting it . 
  it 's a weird process , education . 
  in dutch gymnasia , you can pick between a ( statistics and such , mostly for people who do geesteswetenschappen ) , b ( contains all the bits you need for natuurwetenschappen ) , c ( for people who really do n't like maths ) , and d ( addendum to b , `` fun maths '' ) . 
  we did logic for the philosophy part of a course called `` algemene natuurwetenschappen '' , which is mandatory . 
  for some reason europeans stopped believing in international trains for a large part , and now seem to think that taking a plane for a 400 kilometer trip is a sensible thing to do . 
  yes . 
  you can just take a seat in the next available train , provided they 're available . 
  this is common policy . 
  kohl ... own ? 
  maybe you should 've picked better maths . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant too . 
  i had n't even really thought about the knowledge of the tourist ( which , of course , would make someone a ` good ' or ` bad ' tourist , if we go by op 's story ) . 
  i agree with op that a lot of ruckus is caused by northern europeans in southern europe . 
  when i 'm in spain , the last thing i want to encounter are other dutch people . 
  hell , i 'm annoyed by a lot of dutch people in my own country as well . 
  do i just need to get more cultural knowledge of those people to understand them better ? 
  in my mind they 're just rotten . 
  what 's the game ? 
  comparing things to iceland ? 
  you said yes to 80 % of the existing words . 
  you said yes to 3 % of the nonwords . 
  you have to understand the historical context in europe . 
  the second world war left a big scar . 
  that , combined with the fact that the niche that far-right ideology left after 1945 is now being occupied by what the media calls `` populism '' , makes the majority of people very wary . 
  people are genuinely concerned that far-right politics is making a comeback , and imho they 're right to oppose it with words in this manner . 
   in my experience it is only the french , italians , spaniards and the british though , because when germans and scandinavians are annoying i understand why , so it does n't bother me as much . 
  so does it come down to one 's cultural knowledge ? 
  are you less annoyed when certain expectations are fulfulled ? 
  i totally understand your rant and i 've made it before too , but if this is true it opens up an entirely different perspective . 
  i remember making peseta necklaces when i went on holiday . 
  cornflakes/muesli are somewhat popular in the netherlands , but as most people just stick to sliced bread with cheese or [ hagelslag ] ( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/819xwk5s-il._sl1500_.jpg ) , the market is limited . 
  let 's also point out that the vast majority of dutch people did n't vote . 
  you 're right , but not completely . 
  saying that greece 's train system is not running is just false , and doing a google search you could 've easily found that greek trains are running just fine . 
  also , you can actually reach greece from , say , paris , in a single journey with only 2 changes in zurich and belgrade . 
  idk man , sounds accurate, 
  the 2 that pop into my head : mcdonalds - mekkie albert heijn - appie ( hardly global , but they have some international presence ), 
  since i 've never been outside of europe , these are all the countries i 've visited , in chronological order , and with frequencies in brackets : * spain ( 21 ) * italy ( 3 ) * germany ( 3 ) * france ( 4 ) * belgium ( 4 ) * greece ( 2 ) * uk ( 3 ) * switzerland ( 1 ) * ireland ( 5 ) * vatican ( 1 ) * iceland ( 1 ) * denmark ( 1 ) * czechia ( 1 ) * romania ( 1 ) * macedonia ( 1 ) that makes 15 . 
  definitely check out [ ** the man in seat 61 ** ] ( http://seat61.com ) . 
  it 's a guide for any rail journey in europe . 
  you can even look up city-to-city routes , all nicely layed out with info on how to buy tickets . 
  other than that , i 'd recommend browsing the operators ' web pages a bit ( [ voyages sncf ] ( http://en.voyages-sncf.com/en/ ) for france , [ renfe ] ( http://www.renfe.com ) for spain , [ deutsche bahn ] ( http://www.bahn.de ) for germany etc. 
  etc. ), 
  and see what fares you can get through them . 
  be aware that buying loose tickets is probably only cheaper if you 're able to get the lower fares , which sell out quickly ( booking opens ~ 3 months in advance on most trains , but this differs . 
  seat61 will know . ), 
  the trainline , as an all-in-one solution , is quite a new thing in european train ticketing , along with [ captaintrain ] ( http://www.captaintrain.com ) and [ loco2 ] ( http://www.loco2.com ) , and sometimes those sites are n't perfect . 
  i just wanted to inform you that there is no such thing as ` the eurorail ' . 
  normal and high-speed rail services are operated throughout europe by several companies , usually in cooperation with the local national railway company . 
  for london-paris , for example , you need eurostar . 
  paris-amsterdam ? 
  that 's thalys . 
  the company eurail obfuscates all this . 
  you 're often better off buying individual tickets through the different operators directly than you are buying a rail pass . 
  if you book early ( ~ 3 months in advance ) , you can get the cheaper fares for trains . 
  have a look at [ ** the man in seat 61 ** ] ( http://seat61.com ) , the european train travel bible . 
  you do n't need a pass if you 're smart about your planning . 
  seriously ... amsterdam-paris , for example , has a decent number of tickets going for $ 39 , - . 
  however , buying these tickets on the day of departure is going to put you back at least $ 130 , -, 
  i think you should just be able to read the first thing though . 
  it 's not that hard if you put your mind to it a little bit ... 
  for one , trains are much nicer than ryanair . 
  apart from that , train booking opens on shorter terms than flight booking , so it serves a purpose in that regard . 
  you can get a single paris-barcelona for $ 59 , for example . 
  try that 3 months before departure with ryanair . 
  no silly extra luggage fees either ... 
  train via brussels and roosendaal could be cheap enough . 
  it looks like there are two 4:08 hour long connections a day from the tgv station outside calais via brussels and roosendaal to 's - hertogenbosch . 
  do a search on nsinternational.nl for fares and times . 
  there 's trains from almost everywhere around luxemburg to luxemburg . 
  try searching for flights to london , brussels , amsterdam , frankfurt . 
  any of these could be viable . 
  loco2 or captaintrain for train schedules/tickets . 
  if you 're new to over-land travel in europe , you should check out seat61.com . 
  helmet 's do n't help a thing if you 're hit by a car though . 
  they 're only effective at higher cycling speeds . 
  it seems very strange to me that one would try at something like this alone . 
  would n't he have needed some support without risking being killed himself ? 
  you 're already saying yourself why that definition does not apply . 
  two people who might simply not want children marry all the time . 
  and there 's nothing wrong about that either . 
  it is not a social construct for a man and a woman . 
  i would argue that it 's not a social construct at all , but a very real human tendency that we have decided to institutionalize and base many laws on . 
  because it entails the coming to the realization of a people ( or , some judges , i suppose ) that marriage is not necessarily between a man and a woman for every person , and that the state should not impose such restrictions if its people should be free . 
  mind you , marriage is a human thing . 
  not just a christian thing . 
  it 's impossible to know , then . 
  even if it was true , it 's still very much primarily a feeling . 
  define truth please . 
  well spoken . 
  okay , but surely things get more complicated down the line . 
  not every muslim is busy interpreting the quran all the time . 
  edit : you could say that it 's not so much them interpreting the quran as it is the interwovenness between quran and culture .
