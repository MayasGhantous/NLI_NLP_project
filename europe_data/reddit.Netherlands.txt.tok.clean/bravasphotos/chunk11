  hmm , what about the first paragraph of [ this ] ( http://nos.nl/l/2163956 ) news article . 
  it sadly lacks too many ` ch ' , 
  [ where is the love ?!, 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_roman_empire#/media/file%3amitteleuropa_zur_zeit_der_staufer.svg ), 
  have you tried pronouncing it ( correctly ) ? 
  have you also tried pronouncing it ( correctly ) ? 
  it 's not against my language , i pity the fool that tries to learn it , because it 's difficult to learn , lol, 
  i pity the fool that wants to learn dutch, 
  the uk is different though , because it has a separate church . 
  the us is also a bit different , due to their culture , for example the glorification of george washington and the patriotism . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.diffen.com/difference/catholic_vs_protestant ) is a list of differences between catholicism and protestantism . 
  in protestantism , there is more a relationship between god , work and the self , which makes it more humble as opposed to catholicism , i think . 
  hi , consider reposting to / r/es or / r/spain ( or basque subs listed in the aforementioned subs ) for a more direct interaction with the basques themselves . 
  there is not much glorification in historically protestant countries , however , i always love rabenhaupt . 
  oh , i 'm not very familiar with italy , however , i 'd consider genoa and in florence , i 'd definitely go to machiavelli 's house , but that 's just me . 
  a rule of thumb for mediterranean countries : churches and cathedrals are * always * worth the visit . 
  they 're just stunning !, 
  i 'm not from amsterdam myself . 
  i just like to walk around the city . 
  the rijksmuseum ( imperial museum ) is also definitely worth the visit !, 
  furthermore , the central station is beautiful and that 's pretty much it , in my mind . 
  go to the italian restaurant ` vapiano ' . 
  it 's cheap and delicious !, 
  it 's near the rembrandtplein . 
  a canal tour * can * be fun , but tickets are expensive . 
  might as well walk around and stumble across markets and stuff . 
  i do n't know how to approach a'dam . 
  i usually take out my friends for a walk and talk about stuff i see and explain the history behind it , it 's all improvised . 
  oh , sorry , forgot to save that part . 
  i think that i 'd do 11 days of italy , because italy is great and both countries deserve to be spent lots of time in . 
  seems pretty ok to me . 
  perhaps check if you can make travel for you the easiest , such as by going north to south or east to west . 
  that looks better . 
  i know for certain that / r/italy has a great tourism wiki . 
  enjoy our trip !, 
  i do n't really understand the question . 
  i do n't think it 's confusing , because i rarely talk about jupiter 's moons . 
  the best stickers are those of the matterhorn of about a decade ago . 
  of course , you had to display you were there and successfully crossed the mountain !, 
  basically all of belgium ^ ^ ^ ^ , 
  i 'm all for . 
  the more smart , attractive and fit people the better . 
  i think it 's more inhumane to let people with ( severe ) disabilities life . 
  in my opinion , that 's the real suffering , despite all the institutions and facilities . 
  for example , would you prefer to drive a brand new and safe car or an old one which misses two tires ? 
  i think the government should take advice from scientists in the field to compose numerous and clear guidelines . 
  politicians are n't usually scientists , so they 'd have to work together to prevent bad government involvement and possibly unethical markets . 
  however , i must admit that all the faults humans have has quite a ` romantic ' perspective . 
  idk the right word , it slipped my mind . 
  just the dirty work , masta, 
  yeah , unless it 's very busy . 
  i usually raise my hand and say : `` thank you . '', 
  unless it 's in the weekend , then i say : `` enjoy your weekend . '', 
  hi , if i understand correctly , this is what you had in mind : * visit aforementioned cities , * stay 4 days at each place , * enjoy the nightlife and stay near the centre , * have time to visit the coast . 
  i assume you 're flying , but in my opinion , it 's quite difficult to go on a day trip from prague to the italian coast . 
  i 'm not really sure how to imagine it , but genoa is great . 
  furthermore , i 'd recommend the use of hostels , because some cities are really fighting airbnb , so there could be some trouble . 
  hostels are somewhere near $ 20 per person , per night . 
  they 're usually encouraged , so i ca n't imagine any trouble there . 
  also , i 'm fairly certain each city has a website of the tourist office , where you can probably find information about the party areas . 
  there is a restaurant chain , vapiano , which is amazing and super cheap . 
  definitely try it in berlin . 
  it 's near the kaiser wilhelm ged\u00e4chtniskirche , if i remember correctly . 
  enjoy your trip !, 
  oh yeah , [ the yde girl ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/yde_girl ) was a very big deal early on at my primary & secondary education . 
  we had a special school trip when to her body once . 
  but nothing else really . 
  please provide some pictures or gifs or any visual stuff . 
  too risky to search online , judging by the names . 
  sounds pretty accurate, 
  life is a party , but you have to hang up the slingers yourself, 
  i do n't know how to explain it and vocaroo does n't work on mobile , however , at 0:28 of [ this clip ] ( https://youtu.be/7-khpaae_gm ) , you might get an idea of how it 's pronounced , i hope . 
  val dood - drop dead, 
  reddit , whatsapp , google , music and my bank 's app . 
  b1 is the minimum , i 'd say . 
  as long as the message comes across . 
  how is that discrimination ? 
  lol that 's called a discussion . 
  of course it 's legal and common . 
  yeah , he said how much he hates changing currency when going from de to pl because no $ $ $ . 
  easy in most daily life aspects like travelling and buying stuff . 
  mostly because it 's much easier . 
  it was just the internship , however , i had to write a report about it about several subjects . 
  during my previous course , something like a college , i had to go abroad for 5 months of internship . 
  every study had a certain code and through a special website , we 'd be able to contact certified businesses . 
  now , it 's a government-owned site . 
  you could find new businesses , but they 'd have to go through the application process to become verified . 
  that was it . 
  all i had to do was sign a few things for erasmus , sign a contract with the company and voil\u00e0 . 
  i 've only seen vapes in amsterdam . 
  lol, 
  i was in barcelona and a government-owned company had a list of suitable companies for every course . 
  [ stagemarkt ] ( https://www.stagemarkt.nl/zoeken ) is the name , i think . 
  a scholarship will help a lot , but most of my friends and i did n't break even , but it 's a great way to get experience and it 's very cool . 
  i have done an internship in spain , and i highly recommend doing it . 
  important factors to do/keep in mind are : * choose a fun company to work for , * choose a fun place to stay , * blend in with the locals , * speak spanish even if you know it sucks , * try mixing in the regional language , * going abroad costs a lot of money ( you 're lucky to break even ) , * it 's a hell of a great experience . 
  best places for what ? 
  [ / r/italy tourism wiki ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/wiki/tourism_faq ), 
  pretty ok . best drivers are germans , the worst are italians , in my opinion . 
  i 've only ever met a fortune teller once , in barcelona , because she was my neighbour .
