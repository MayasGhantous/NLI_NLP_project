  i do n't count belgium as a real country . 
  well , that just means that the kingdom has land next/close to iberia , but traveling from my house to iberia would still take a long time, 
  i 'd switch the french for the spanish and the belgians for the portuguese without hesitation . 
  because i like iberia more than france & belgium . 
  the anthem , i 'd say . 
  i 've never met a portuguese person outside of portugal , now that i think about it . 
  i just love portugal . 
  i wish more would come here with some chouri\u00e7o , azulejos and ginhja ( i keep forgetting how to write it ) . 
  aaierbal, 
  eh , i do n't support trump , but the groups against him and protesting against him are the enemy of my enemy . 
  nothing more or less to me personally . 
  ca n't wait for airplane compensation corner to cover this . 
  [ give this a try ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=celex:32004r0261&amp;from=nl ) . 
  i 'm too lazy to check . 
  that 's the joke, 
  i think it would be useful to have a search bar for this sub . 
  lmao , you did n't admit anything here yet , plus , you complain about things that were more common back in the day . 
  get that stick out of your ass and stop looking at the past like people still do it today . 
  you 're using the word ` cheese ' in a very , very liberal sense here . ^ , 
  [ yeah , really ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_dutch_inventions_and_discoveries ) . 
  yeah , i do n't like political polls . 
  for the rest , i love data . 
  i like sr. . puidgemont , he just seems like a great , competent and social guy . 
  i like how he interacts on social media and stuff . 
  can a catalan president be elected infinitely or is there a limit like in the us ? 
  i know mas , but not more than his name and a few things he organised . 
  we stand for a lot of good causes , have a great and rich history , tend to make sober and good decisions and most institutions are pretty well arranged here . 
  i 'd part of the pinya , so good luck getting me up there !, 
   the report , however , is based on the central government , so even though my sympathies to catalunya , the report focuses on the entire state interests . 
  now if you 'd nominate me for m.h. 
  president , we might get another kind of report . 
  yeah , literally this . 
  there 's only one way to find out . 
  surely , educated people vote for populists , but i 'm willing to bet they 're a small minority compared to other audiences like low-skilled/educated people . 
  populism is n't the future , i think , it 's more of a phase . 
  it 's like click bait . 
  people do it , because it currently works , but within a few generations , it 'll die out , if the trend of more higher educated people keeps going . 
  hmm , i kinda agree with you . 
  my preferable system of government would be more authoritarian , something like a constitutional authority . 
  basically , i 'm pro-machiavellian governments . 
  i like competent monarchs , so inheritance is a problem , because who knows if the heir would be competent so that 's my foremost problem with monarchies . 
  i think intellectual democracy is the most realistic situation we have though . 
  surely , higher education is becoming more mainstream , but that 's good . 
  i still think despite some exceptions , higher ed . 
  people will still vote smarter and is thus the current , most realistic way of governance . 
  the video highlights the importance of education . 
  reforming education , which will change the way societies live , act and think will thus , i think , solve the problem of populism . 
  not immediately , but gradually , as people will be able to make better and more strategic decisions . 
  i thought that was pretty clear in the video . 
  do n't ask me how to reform education precisely , because that must be researched thoroughly . 
  i 'd ask the help of the creators of linked video . 
  i think democracy is one of the better systems of government we have , and that even the netherlands has one of the best versions of it , however , i consider you to watch [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/fljbzhcswtk ) . 
  i think it 's still applicable today and is the cause of populism . 
  cause and a way of elimination , in my opinion .

  i like black/latino/scottish people twitter the most . 
  they 're more current , but dankmemes , me_irl and 2me4irl have some funny ones too every once in a while . 
  i 'd personally prefer the removal of populism everywhere . 
  yeah , but is n't / was n't it a default sub ? 
  so you 're automatically subscribed to it , but i know/hope that a vast majority is n't active on it . 
  i thought those macros died out tbh, 
  i love my country , but i do n't like some of the people here . 
  rarely , i think . 
  maybe a few lines here and there , but probably not entire songs . 
  i like [ copycats ] ( https://youtu.be/iuyk7cnzgo4 ) . 
  ca n't really think of another european rap song . 
  just google . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://moralmachine.mit.edu/ ) . 
  dumb question as well , op . 
  depends on where in south spain you want to go . 
  if it 's within a few hours , you can rent a car , but i 'd recommend public transport or even flying over renting a car at that point . 
  i 've had english classes since i was 12 , i believe . 
  furthermore , it was through films , games , my parents starting it early and a general interest . 
  bless subtitles . 
  and the [ alegor\u00eda de hispania ] ( https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/alegor%c3%ada_de_hispania#/languages ) . 
  i like her . 
  too much at stake . 
  because they were at he forefront of that event , for example a revolution or field of work , which probably became widely popular because of them . 
  oh , i did n't know belgium had underground tours ^ , 
  hmm , not in my country , but in toledo , you have remains that are accessible through some kind of clothing store near the jesuit church . 
  it 's pretty fun , i think . 
  fancy ` and ' because i do n't actually know the name, 
  no problem !, 
  if you have n't seen the first one yet , ocho apellidos vascos , i highly recommend watching that too . 
  it explains quite some backstory . 
  aaah , okay , i was already guessing from the context the more basque the better and i know of eta , but did n't know kale borroka . 
  thank you for the explanation !, 
  hmm , i personally feel more involved with spain and the stereotypes than most people , so i think it 's different for me . 
  in terms of understanding the language there were quite some troubles , but i have subs on and the audio in spanish . 
  i did n't understand * vascos * nearly as well as * catalenes * , but i think i got most jokes . 
  i think both are hilarious and great to watch . 
  a few topics i feel unsure about that i got : * mossos being aggressive * basques having 8 surnames * kale borraske ( i think it 's written like that ), 
  thanks viktor . 
  kind of peculiar why the subs said `` damnit '' , but i 'll take it . 
  pretty good film tbh ( spoiler ? ), 
  only part i really remember is that scene in the bar where he used [ this ] ( https://imgur.com/a/auosb ) instead of [ this ] ( https://imgur.com/a/ljct8 ) or vice versa, 
  depends on where in europe you are lol, 
  pretty much every film i 've seen is foreign , at least 95 % . 
  now i 'm watching [ ocho apellidos catalanes ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ocho_apellidos_catalanes ) and this morning i watched [ ocho apellidos vascos ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ocho_apellidos_vascos ) .
