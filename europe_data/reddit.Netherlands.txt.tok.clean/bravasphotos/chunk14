  man , your rhetoric is so dumb . 
  i 'd rather have a ban on that , lol . 
  paris , lisbon , ljubljana and vienna . 
  ( to name a few ), 
  no of course not . 
  we need advertisements to stimulate sales , share information or influence behaviour . 
  there should restrictions on parts like ads for children or not being placed in obstructive locations , but for the rest we just need it . 
  currently , i am really liking * [ safari ] ( https://youtu.be/jwesltakklu ) * . 
  i like the fact that you wrote ' ** country ** ', 
  america first , netherlands second ( all in all , i think trump is retarded , but it 's good for the eu to do their own things , namely military . 
  i do n't like being depended on someone across the ocean . 
  heck , i do n't like being depended by other eu countries either , but i think that we 're all in the same boat here , so we 're good . 
  it 's ok , i think . 
  i want to be a captain on an old wooden voc type of ship . 
  diseases, 
  yeah , quite a bit . 
  what if we 're the same person ? 
  yo dummy , i even linked the ` definition ' of the term to those idiots ' wiki . 
  what ? 
  no , if course it 's not racist . 
  if there 's one thing we should n't do , it 's copying guilt and shitty policies from americans . 
  i 'm white as milk , blonde and half-turk . 
  you do n't think i 'm all up in that lahmacun or d\u00f6ner when i have one ? 
  y' all sjws gon na catch these hands when trying to get me to not use other cultures ' aspects . 
  get that tapas here , boy . 
  gim me that turr\u00f3n , ayvar or bratwurst !, 
  lmao , there is a [ sjwiki ] ( http://sjwiki.org/wiki/cultural_appropriation ) -- edits : mostly grammar and rephrasing in all seriousness , it 's not racist by itself . 
  i guess you could be disrespectful to some cultures , like disturbing or destroying a holy week parade in spain , burn a flag or whatever . 
  yet , i think the vast majority does n't do or intend to do that . 
  all of them interest me , but the scandinavian countries interest me the least . 
  except norway , because i saw * okkupert * ( or whatever ) and they seem cool . 
  i do n't understand what you mean . 
  nyc style implies the height . 
  design can be cool , but i doubt that a lot of them are viable to build . 
  i like neighbourhoods of some apartment complexes like 20 floors high , but with a good , environmentally friendly design . 
  that 's probably much better than 1 skyscraper of 40 floors . 
  i saw some concept art of rotterdam skyscrapers and most look quite decent . 
  i do n't like the ` dull ' colours in your link though . 
  brown is so depressing . 
  might be better to go directly to / r/slovenia, 
  through the fingers seen , 
  well , you * see * it , but it 's [ technically not allowed ] ( https://www.om.nl/onderwerpen/boetebase/?boete_tree=21928,21918#beslissingpad2192821918 ), 
  both . 
  rarely , luckily . 
  juncker is a precious man . 
  that sounds and looks horrible , though i 'm somewhat curious to try it out . 
  beans with syrup ? 
  what 's that recipe called ? 
  it 's prohibited , but can still be seen happening . 
  i do n't know why anybody would do that though , it 's much more comfortable drink at home . 
  well that 's per capita , so probably there are people that earn a lot and not a lot , and thus you get the 3k . 
  plus , the local prices do n't need to be expensive either . 
  if the government is able to create decent infrastructure , maintain separation of power and keep corruption to a minimum , you 'll quickly rise on that list . 
  a lot of african countries have none of that or they ca n't carry it out , such as lack of institutions . 
  well , the unemployment sucks , but the muslims are ok . 
  i have muslim roots deep in my family tree , plus i got some connections in raval , we good . 
  [ * mysteriously fades to the background * ] ( https://youtu.be/yabiuwuschq ), 
  i 'll give [ them ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nvghkat.jpg ) a try this friday , 
  patatas bravas flavoured chips, 
  i recently saw [ patatas bravas ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nvghkat.jpg ) chips in the netherlands . 
  i want to try those . 
  patatje joppie is awfully strange , yet delicious . 
  it 's possible , yes . 
  new union , who dis, 
  i think skyscrapers like nyc style are quite unpopular , also useless here . 
  i wish there was more construction of houses , that 'll cater to demand and lower house prices . 
  just build some apartment blocks pls . 
  oh i 'm planning to !, 
  just got ta finish my uni here , 
  barcelona , because i like it there . 
  though i have a long list of potential places to live . 
  snert is love , snert is life, 
  [ worn out places , worn out faceeees ] ( https://youtu.be/2nmucdptxse ), 
  old people voted for brexit . 
  i think that only the low educated people truly believe wilders and his out of eu/eurozone bullshit . 
  everybody with a decent degree and logic recognise the cancer he is , especially at unis . 
  never . 
  the educated people here know what horrible damage a nexit will bring . 
  [ dont you dare make fun of these little treasures ] ( https://youtu.be/z3znkaihtvw ), 
  most stuff is in uk english . 
  i think most comedians are absolute shit here . 
  i only like youp van ' t hek and his dry , nasty humour and najib amhali from my childhood . 
  the rest only ` yells ' to be funny , in my opinion . 
  the yelling part is both literally and figuratively . 
  ice skating best skating, 
  [ these are the worst though ] ( https://imgur.com/a/jcimu ), 
  idk man . 
  all i see now when reading it hearing german is : `` ooh , i wonder which grammatical case that is '' y' all fucked me up with them nominativs and genitivs . 
  no logic , just tears . 
  [ anthem of slavs ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bntw6fzz-1e ) works well too, 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/s4tr9tuaki4 ) will never get old . 
  usually yes , but i have a german test on thursday so i set eu4 to german . 
  yeah . 
  the basques had territory in france , but they merged in well with the french over time , afaik . 
  i hate it when people litter . 
  i think the majority of litter is from those chavs type of people with their lays , cigarettes and discount redbull from aldi . 
  i 'd like to a further integration of laws , economies and army . 
  america has become unreliable for all of those . 
  i think most of the stuff is pretty well arranged already , but i think the army part should definitely become a bigger issue in the union .
