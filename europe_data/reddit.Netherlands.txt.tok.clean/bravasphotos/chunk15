  barely . 
  i do n't really know a lot of smokers , really . 
  for which i 'm very grateful . 
  now , i will forever refer to that part as the ` bananus ' . 
  hell no . 
  shoes and socks get so ` tight ' after a while . 
  i take them off as soon as possible and lay in my bed . 
  warmth and comfort galore . 
  probably quite a few . 
  she 's a good leader . 
  she has some mistakes and appears weak sometimes , but i like her . 
  divide & reconquer, 
  i did n't know if its existence before this . 
  visit depends on flag . 
  i have no interest of visiting them , however , that may always change later on . 
  i know someone named pia , but nobody with any of the names listed in the title . 
  i think our history books in secondary school spent like 1/2 a4 on this entire topic . 
  i like the romanticisation ( ? ), 
  of it , but crusaders were retards , honestly . 
  they made getting the restoration of the roman empire achievement on eu4 fucking hell . 
  i 'd never use that , perhaps in professional life , but whatsapp , or god forbid , text messages are way better . 
  too many . 
  no , because in the netherlands , the central government delegates power to the provinces and municipalities . 
  i guess a central government is federal in terms of the various ministries . 
  i guess belgium is federal , because of the ethnic and cultural divide . 
  i think they use this system with the theory that not one region can oppress the other , like walloon oppressing flanders and vice versa . 
  it 's just that majority of europe is not federal , so that 's probably why it 's a surprise . 
  i still have no idea what to think of that . 
  i think of germany as a federation , though i do n't know how much power each region has compared to the central government . 
  i have literally no idea what you mean . 
  do you want to know what europeans think when they read the words ` liberal ' and ` federal ' ? 
  dziekuje for preaching the truth, 
  * now the monkey comes out of the sleeve . 
  * life 's a party , but you have to hang up the slingers yourself . 
  barely , luckily . 
  imperial sizes make no sense at all . 
  ban the heresy !, 
  perhaps it has risen in popularity , but i still feel like it gets dismissed by lots of people . 
  just behave normal , do n't do anything strange and you 'll be ok . 
  portugal is a hidden gem for holidays . 
  bicycle, 
  i have absolutely no idea . 
  i think there is not much talk about those countries here , perhaps in a few , specific circles . 
  i understand you focus on the murder genes part , as i also think there is very small chance of such a gene , but i also mentioned mental illness , and not even deformaties . 
  okay . 
  opposing to your , and popular opinion , is bad . 
  i guess we see who truly is accepting here . 
  because the world needs to progress and evolve , and people that are more likely to things like mental illness halt that . 
  it 's not like nature is kind to the weak . 
  i also wrote mental illness in my comments . 
  the research makes it a good case . 
  perhaps it is not as economically viable as i thought ** under the current , american system ** , i should add . 
  there 's always room for improvement , and i think the us legal system is not quite a shining example . 
  it would be interesting to talk with people of law about this . 
  on the other hand , removing such genes from the pool may also bring benefits . 
  there is no use in thieves and lunatics , i think . 
  you 've got a source on that ? 
  nevertheless , that is a problem of bureaucracy , which can surely become more efficient . 
  i think it is more humane for some people to die that to live , for example those with severe mental illness , that ca n't stray from murder or rape . 
  this is very delicate , but i think it should be carefully used as to not spread those kind of previously mentioned genes . 
  -- edit : lifelong imprisonment is a waste of money and resources that can be spent on far more important causes . 
  was n't there a big ` scandal ' recently with the murder of the leader of the pirate party that was found dead at some other politician 's house ? 
  yeah , with his shitty ass vodka . 
  aah , i love it when eu4 is leaking, 
  this thread is a mess delet this, 
  because people play baseball . 
  those ugly ass pickups -- sorry , they 're called [ pickups ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=american+trucks&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiy9z2zik7rahvgvhokhcysdsqq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=710#tbm=isch&amp;q=american+pickups ), 
  ooh , it 's about those kings , i know that story , but the explanations i read were so poorly explained that i was starting to wonder which kings they were talking about . 
  :p by the way , is the bean inside the cake ? 
  those umbrellas are a smart idea , lol . 
  the festival reminds me of the dutch * [ sinterklaas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinterklaas ) * . 
  thank you for your explanation !, 
  i 've been reading about three kings ' day in spain , but i did n't really understand the story of it . 
  [ the food ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=los+reyes+magos+comida&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=710&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewjsjqsqt63rahvm5xokhwcxafiq_auibigb#imgrc=_ ) , whatever it is , looks delicious . 
  you are more stupid than i had previously thought . 
  i 'm not saying i hate moroccans or turks . 
  it 's the statistics that matter , and if the statistics say that a moroccan or antillian is more likely to rob you , i 'm taking precaution . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.dvhn.nl/groningen/marokkaanse-%e2%80%98asielzoekers%e2%80%99-rovend-door-stad-21778893.html ) is also why i dislike immigrants that are just here for the ` oprotpremie ' i 'm half a turk myself , and i love turks from turkey , but not those that immigrated to here . 
   i 'm sick and tired ... you can be sick and tired , but neither your or my opinion matters in the big scheme of things . 
  get some coffee and a paracetamol . 
  also , watch * opsporing verzocht * . 
  how much do you want to wager that the majority is ` coloured ' in the episodes ? 
   our country ... 
  i 've got a dutch passport , and am a citizen by birth , and i will not have it governed by weaklings like you . 
  you 're phrasing is so dumb , honestly . 
  you 're the one ` oppressing ' me that i ca n't have a different opinion , dumbass . 
  and no , i will not accept your small minded view . 
  if you ca n't accept reality , i genuinely think you 're a waste of resources . 
  you sadly have the right to live . 
   i 'm sick and tired of small town uneducated fools ... also , you 're ` making fun ' of me coming from a small village , so you 're the dumb cunt , yet again !, 
  is that discriminating by origins too , or villaginating ? 
   there are other ways besides race to judge people . 
  so you do n't mind judging people then ? 
  -- # [ necessary edit ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/020/310/8qtzkrj-.jpg ) other edits : more statistics & roastings,
