  amsterdam is too big of a city for me . 
  i , as a proper village boy from my youth , am a bit wary of large cities . 
  amsterdam has the added misfortune to be very densely populated and very busy , in my eyes . 
  also , i do n't like those groups of young moroccans , antillians and turks , especially not when they 're on scooters , let alone at night . 
  in my experience , they 're far more aggressive , and the majority of those programmes where the police asks for clues on cases , the attackers/robbers are ` coloured ' . 
  the statistics do n't lie . 
  hmm , it 's okay . 
  sometimes , they play too many dutch songs . 
  there is n't much space for dancing , but it 's usually ok . 
  i think they close around 6 am . 
  if you have connections , drinks are cheaper . 
  the general price is acceptable . 
  eh , my city , groningen , is fun , but the first time i went clubbing was in barcelona , so in comparison , it 's definitely less fun . 
  although , everything here is near each other , my home and my friend 's home . 
  i 'd like to go clubbing in utrecht and leiden , but not amsterdam , because i do n't feel safe there in general , let alone at night . 
  thursdays are ` student nights ' and tuesdays are very fun too . 
  do n't go on fridays/saturdays , because then the quite annoying young people from the villages come , and they 're incredibly annoying , act macho and are generally not pleasant folk to be going out with . 
  depends on some factors . 
  when alcohol levels increase , my chances of pronouncing english decrease . 
  i always hate * effect * , * affect * and * aesthetic * . 
  please do n't spread it . 
  no , why ? 
  hmm , i ca n't seem to get it in a pdf format . 
  i 'm heading to bed now , i 'll see if i can fix it tomorrow . 
   goodnight !, 
  oh that 's also a good idea . 
  i 'll take it into the writing . 
  keep it up !, 
  exports are quite important , but it also depends on the type of exports . 
  ideally , you want domestic and foreign businesses to ship parts to slovenia , assemble them there and then transport them again . 
  this way , you create jobs at in slovenia , get toll money and increase exports . 
  i love slovenia . 
  from what i know , it 's like an ideal country , especially the education system . 
  i hope to visit ljubljana soon !, 
  sure , i 'll keep you up to date . 
  i 'm sick anyway , so i might work on it tomorrow . 
  though i warn you , as i 'll do in in the foreword , that i 'm no expert on legal aspects or political aspects . 
  thus , such an idea should be thoroughly researched , but i do n't have the material or finance for that . 
  if you 're interested , i 'm working on a report for spain , for cultural , economic and political reforms . 
  it 's still an early draft , but an ok thing so far . 
  if you 're interested , i can pm you a pdf . 
  it would be nice to get some feedback . 
  hence the etc. 
  i thought by typic ` germanic ' would bring the message across . 
  of course , the report would be far more detailed and clearer . 
  i 'm on mobile , but germanic as in terms of germania , which does include poles , although not entirely . 
  you can search google for a map . 
  that 's hard for me to say now . 
  i guess a logical option would be to join the germanic eu . 
  i should write a report on this . 
  people saying * keizer * or * koning * ( emperor - king ) when someone does apparently something impressive . 
  fucking annoying . 
  i do n't think that would work , because the cultures differ too much . 
  i 'd be curious to see an eu that consists of multiple unions ; * nordic eu ( scandinavia & baltics ) * romance eu ( italy , greece , spain , portugal & perhaps france ) * germanic eu ( germany , poland , the netherlands etc. ), 
  these unions can enforce their own law , but can also make law for the european union , thus the 28 countries . 
  these are aspects like schengen and free movement of people/goods . 
  then they can also make laws that are only specific to that union , such as tariffs on chinese steel or whatever . 
  i think that would work more effective , to be honest . 
  germans are so cute in how they approach work . 
  so effective and efficient . 
  belgians are sweet people , but inaudible . 
  luxembourg people have cute accents . 
  the fitnessgram \u2122 pacer test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues . 
  the 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds . 
  line up at the start . 
  the running speed starts slowly , but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal . 
  [ beep ] a single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound . 
  [ ding ] remember to run in a straight line , and run as long as possible . 
  the second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound , your test is over . 
  the test will begin on the word start . 
  on your mark , get ready , start . 
  [ it 's ok ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/4/48/gdp_at_current_market_prices%2c_2005_and_2013%e2%80%932015_yb16.png ) by these accounts . 
  they ded, 
  ugh , i really want to see the armats in catalonia during the holy week . 
  they 're so fucking cool , man . 
  like , let me do that , i want to do that . 
  or that valencian thing where there 's a moorish capitan all dressed up and parading though the streets . 
  municipalities , hit me up . 
  til ` scowl ' and it happens to describe the expression perfectly too . 
  thanks !, 
  consider checking eurostat for economic information , in comparison to other eu countries . 
  -- eurostat, 
  no , i 'm always curious what nationality others are from and where others think i from . 
  too often , i hear russian , which just surprises me . 
  ` tax havens ' is a term used by foreign countries that are uncompetitive in capitalist markets . 
  yeah , i know , but i think that in comparison to most in eu countries the demand is quite low . 
  though i do n't have the numbers to back it up now . 
  thanks for your comment . 
  i do n't think there is much/any demand for , except for spain and portugal , mostly because madeira and canary/baleares islands . 
  generally , the trains or busses , especially services like flixbus or eurolinrs are both more affordable and plentiful . 
  disregard females , acquire currency, 
  i like latin america , in terms of people , they 're very nice , and lots of aspects of their culture are very fun . 
  their women are also beautiful . 
  however , their politics and economics is so horrible . 
  i know my homie sim\u00f3n bol\u00edvar tried his best though . 
  i do n't know what classifies as old town , but i like [ bourtange ] ( http://bourtange.jouwweb.nl/foto-s-van-oud-bourtange ) . 
  i guess it is most likely reflected on a national level too . 
  occasionally , i enjoy a cigar with some friends myself . 
  hmm , something really local i can think of is the [ siege of groningen ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_groningen ) celebration .
