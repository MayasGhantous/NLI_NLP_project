  oh , i think pt is pretty sexy , though i must admit that i first thought it sounded like russian , but not br pt . 
  the ginhja also helped . 
  they 're both sexy , and italian is pretty useful because it 's a decently sized eu economy . 
  portuguese and italian . 
  balikesir is fun for a few days , but not for a holiday . 
  kusadasi has too many tourists in the summer for my liking . 
  they are loud and have some movement , but they 're not * that * strong , i think . 
  yeah just do it man . 
  do n't let this negativity hold you back . 
  you do you . 
  i ca n't wait to stuff myself with the stol, 
  italian is always useful . 
  oh , god !, 
  my eyes !, 
  hmm , this is n't something i really thought about . 
  it 's more like : `` hey , this land is pretty plowable , let 's live here ! '', 
   \u2714 \u2714 read at 16:53 ok, 
  to a degree , yes . 
  the best way to run a country is by means of uniformity , which is the opposite of multiculturalism . 
  it 's not that i ` despise ' or ` hate ' foreigners , in fact , i love foreigners and i 'm half foreign myself . 
  i 'm just judging this through the eye of the state m - which should be effective and efficient , in my opinion . 
  no , if there 's something worse than dutch , it 's flemish . 
  not fluently , well , barely , but i * think * i can understand it pretty decently . 
  we were neutral , but such an important event in history , especially due to its relations to wwii should be taught nonetheless . 
  barely . 
  though i did n't have history as a class since i was like 13 or 14 . 
  i think that depended on what direction you chose ( economic , agricultural , technical & health care ) and i chose economics , so stuff focused on businesses . 
  it 's for the aspiring writers, 
  i do n't feel related/a personal connection to the southern provinces/randstad at all , with their silly accent and stuff . 
  although neither do i feel something for the frisians . 
  i feel dutch , but i also feel gronings . 
  so for me it 's a bit different , but in general , the cultural division is at the rhine . 
  well , i love spanish and portuguese women , and i think i have a fun name for my future daughter : mar\u00eda marcela luc\u00eda . 
  but the problem is that she 'd also have my and my wife 's last name , and that 's just so damn long . 
  but i just love the name so much . 
  it sounds pretty cool . 
  i do n't think dutch women have to change their last name , but i think it 's pretty common to do . 
  if you think about it , including both is ` fairer ' in a certain aspect .

  yeah , even the ayuntamiento in salou , which is apparently famous for british party travellers , is rebranding itself to become more family oriented . 
  though i was n't an angel myself when partying , at least i was n't screaming loudly or pissing against walls at 4 am . 
  the end of the golden age . 
  no , because nobody can defeat sylvana simons , our saviour . 
  i think the idea is interesting , but naming it reddit is cringey . 
  i use reddit so no one really knows who i am , except the people i want to know , for example from a specific sub . 
  do n't worry , it 's adorable , and i love it !, 
  i think i 've seen some ads that are similar to these . 
  the acronym jrotc kinda sucks tho, 
  i think spaniards speaking english is hilariously cute . 
  -- edit : though i do n't really like [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/ojfwh_4pl20 ) , i just love a spaniard that speaks english with a nice and thick accent . 
  [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/z3znkaihtvw ) is way funnier and has higher production quality . 
  still love it !, 
  i like football , but i have no plans to go russia for a match . 
  no , but my father has a season pass for the provincial football club . 
  i think palermo or malta would be the most romantic . 
  however , c\u00f3rdoba and sevilla get my blood running with passion too . 
  another lovely place is genoa . 
  i 'd personally choose sevilla . 
  [ one time is okay , but this ... ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/12/27/deze-plaatsen-in-de-vs-heten-allemaal-holland-a1428489 ), 
  i hate how the us is * so * unoriginal with town names . 
  i do n't usually talk about this , but as long as the monarchy is composed of competent people , i am very pro monarchy . 
  i especially love the current king and queen . 
  i think the current system of the netherlands works quite well . 
  dude , it feels like the spanish police is catching jihadists left and right . 
  [ 163 arrests since 2015 ] ( https://twitter.com/policia/status/799886935716204545 ), 
  i 'm actually it-retarded . 
  i 'd have never thought of plugging the tv and pc with each other ... 
  okay , i mean this seriously . 
  i ca n't understand that people ` like to watch others play ' . 
  i love watching youtubers , but that 's a completely different state than if you 're physically there with someone . 
  like , come on , grab a controller , i 'm gon na kick your ass i swear to bejesus . 
  yes , jeffrey , i 'll never forgot ` you play , i like to watch ' like no , grab a controller . 
  about the controller . 
  so i kinda assume you turn the screen or do you put it on your lap , lay in bed and use a controller ? 
  this seems unpleasant to me , because at least my laptop heats up quite a bit . 
  heat is bad for the sperm , just saying . 
  also , the screen would be too small for me . 
  i never really gamed on a pc , only cod 4 and those roller coaster games , but that was back in the day of shitty pcs in the `` computer room '' . 
  then i bought myself a ps3 , first one of the village mind you , and that 's why i pretty much only stay console . 
  the worst thing about pc gaming is that my back hurst so much from sitting in a chair , even when it 's pretty comfortable . 
  i prefer laying in bed with the controller in my hand . 
  much more comfortable . 
  it 's also nicer to play a game with my date to just cuddle in bed and play assassin 's creed or something . 
  tl ; dr mostly console because nostalgia , comfort and social interaction . 
  love pc , but never really got into it . 
  i 'd really like euiv and total war : rome ii tho . 
  hmm , it 's just so sexy , but what really gets me is the * r * . 
  oh man , when i hear someone say that i just get butterflies in my stomach, 
  * spanish / portuguese because they 're just ** so ** sexy * italian because it 's the most passionate * german because it makes me feel assertive * english because of the international uses i love many languages , but this is i guess what comes to mind with european languages . 
  i ca n't choose one or the other . 
  they all have a ` purpose ' to me . 
  were by ? 
  earthby . 
  i think it 's $ 1,20 , but i 'm not sure . 
  about 4 years . 
  it 's because it 's in that sub . 
  it 's a glorious meme , i love it . 
  i 'm half turk , but i see a relation between arabs and turks . 
  not that they are the same , but just that there are a lot of similarities , for example historically , religiously and culturally . 
  for me it 's like the slavs .
