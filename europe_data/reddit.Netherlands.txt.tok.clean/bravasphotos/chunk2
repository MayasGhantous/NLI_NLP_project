  i 'm a big fan of architecture , art and nature . 
  the best experiences for me have been in iberia , but after having read the prince ( and loving it ) , i decided to come to florence for a few days , flying from madrid . 
  so far , so good !, 
  slovenia and germany, 
  not really, 
  driving up the matterhorn 10 years ago and getting a sticker on your back window . 
  depends . 
  the sky is nice and blue [ here in spain ] ( https://imgur.com/a/kyw9h ), 
  when i was younger : * pok\u00e9mon pinball * lego football mania * tony hawk * lego indiana jones now : * eu4 * ckii, 
  to *** you *** it does n't seem to matter , but eastern europe ( afaik ) nods at the brutal , communist past under which many of the families had to suffer . 
  [ central europe ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ) would in general be a better term . 
  not anything major, 
  take off the blinders . 
  russia = / = usa eu countries joined the coalition against hussein , for example . 
  no nation joined wanted to help russia take crimea . 
  the fallacy is that you compare completely different situations . 
  a foreign song that sounds better in dutch ? 
  hmmm ... that 's gon na be a tough one . 
  there 's a song from guus meeuwis , which he sings with a german band in english , but the original one sounds better imho . 
  does that count ? 
  all i did was make an eu4 meme and i end up with this lol, 
  why intermarium federation when all we need is a jagiellon !, 
  it seems worth a visit . 
  not gon na lie , pulling up to some cafeteria on the road and giving it my best southern accent seems like fun `` one of them steaks and fries , m ` am '', 
  seems like one of those vanmoof e-bikes would be perfect for this . 
  those are be best e-bikes i 've ever ridden !, 
  this always make me cringe, 
  the feeling of cycling in safety . 
  i know it sounds like a meme at this point , but i dislike public transportation when a bike could easily replace it . 
  # [ the iron price ] ( http://www.eu4wiki.com/achievements#the_iron_price ) * restore the danelaw region to danish rule , and make it danish culture . 
  well , now a lot more , because i studied other languages lol, 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  i have an aunt from turkey that has been living here for nearly 30 years and does n't speak dutch . 
  it goes for too many people that they stay in their native bubble and do n't integrate . 
  i think it 's also easier for indonesians , because of the colonial past . 
  lunch is far more nutritious and gets the morning started . 
  churros would be a snack at like 11:30 imo, 
  no , more like pre-lunch with a coffee, 
  both, 
  there 'll be some , surely , but i 've never heard of those lol, 
  hmm , i think you 're right ( on both points ) . 
  it 's been a while and i 'm trying all i can to forget the horror called secondary school haha, 
  i feel like the majority of the ( reasonably intelligent ) electorate does n't bother with this kind of childish crap , because it 's stupid . 
  yeah , but pre-wwi ca n't be compared to modern day europe lol now it 's way more intertwined than ever before , like for real , but democracies do n't usually fight each other , that 's true . 
  * `` a 10 is for god , a 9 is for the teacher and an 8 is for the student . '', 
  - my teachers * idk , i think i had like 7 subjects in secondary school * afaik these do n't exist , because the cito test largely decides what difficulty of study you follow . 
  * in general , no these do n't exist afaik . 
  * hmm , numerus fixus might apply to this . 
  * no homework , because you spend extra time at school making the work . 
  yeah . 
  too much money at stake . 
  heat from the earth , idk how to otherwise translate it, 
  wow , it 's almost like you 're being realistic and logical, 
  probably canada or australia, 
  just chilling in bed tonight . 
  not really in the mood for anything special or extravagant . 
  pegels, 
  i 'm getting really tired of this subject . 
  here are some ( short and oversimplified ) bulletpoints of what i think : * the middle east is a mess ; * i feel more unpleasant/unsafe when i see large groups of africans , alpha acting moroccans/turks/dutch or whatever ( basically chavs , i guess ) ; * no go zones are such a load of horse shit ; * i do n't think all immigrants are bad ; * i think we should control immigration ; * i think we should not have them longer around in camps like calais , but tell them in return for their stay , shelter and education that they should provide as labour for for example cleaning roads or mowing lawns ; * i wish the governments would agree that we should help them till their country is out of war ; * i wish we assimilated them better ; * i wish we 'd take in the clever , educated and entrepreneurial immigrants ; * i think we should help the border states controlling the immigration ; * i think controlled immigration can help the birth rate in europe ; * probably more stuff i 'm forgetting . 
  probably something like flixbus or eurolines, 
  i 've talked about this kinda thing with dutch and eu friends and we generally seem to come to the following conclusion : immerse yourself in the regional and national culture . 
  do n't compare or talk about america in contrast to europe , unless asked about or telling a anecdote or giving an example . 
  my friends and i find it to be a great nuisance when that happens , because we mostly do n't care , until we start asking/talking about it , but of course that 'll depend per person . 
  just do some research to local etiquettes and for christ 's sake , do n't speak english with locals . 
  give it your best french , polish and etc and i guarantee that people will laugh , but appreciate it . 
  [ what are you talking about ? 
  ] ( http://top10hell.com/top-10-countries-with-most-bicycles-per-capita/ ) -- guys , it 's a joke about that there are almost as many bikes as people here ... 
  sorry , i 've never heard of sweeden, 
  none we used to have some tho , i once read, 
  coffee & milk . 
  easy to drink quickly in the morning and delicious, 
  italians talking softly, 
  i 'll rue the day we start mixing mexican and chinese cuisine lol surely , we mix some cuisines , but afaik it 's more complementary than fusion, 
  [ always reminds me of this ] ( https://imgur.com/a/mmhsz ), 
  we do n't really need too many of them . 
  police chase are a pretty rare occurrence here . 
  the only ones i can remember are * blik op de weg *, 
  i 'm a pretty cool dude , i 'd say, 
  you 're lucky i do n't have a internet-terlik, 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  i 'm narcissistic as fuck . 
  humblebraggy , perhaps, 
  considering i 'm half a turk myself , masallah haha, 
  i love the idea behind it , but the practicality is kinda difficult to judge . 
  i absolutely love not having to deal with currencies and going to a place to change . 
  overall , as having only ever used euros , i 'd judge it 5/7 . 
  i go 1x per year on average, 
  only thing that comes to mind is that the economy/employment is n't as optimal as it could be , but portugal is, 
  well , i do like me of them southerners ... ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) my dear , rafa , [ this is how i feel ] ( https://youtu.be/lyhbaicsbha ), 
  maarten van rossem is one of my favourites . 
  ben feringa has been doing well for himself too . 
  i ca n't think of any others at the moment , but surely when i read some names in this thread they 'll sound familiar . 
  i 'm not sure if the women used any birth control stuff . 
  i remember at least one woman who asked me if she should do the morning after pill , so i told her yes to be sure . 
  damn i changed my ways about a year ago ? 
  it depends on the sex . 
  i 'm not receiving a bj when a condom on . 
  that 's like mopping the floor without a broom . 
  so i guess age 18-19 when i began thinking about it . 
  sorry , rafa , i highly doubt he swings both ways .
