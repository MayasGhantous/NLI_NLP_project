  consider changing names to merel or tessa and he 'll be all ~ over ~ inside you haha, 
  czech republic probably, 
  despite the ungrounded assumption , i think that in general , people use protection . 
  my slutty bff does n't and may have an std , but i hope not for him . 
  not gon na lie , i been hitting it raw too a few times , but i changed my ways . 
  from now on i 've sworn myself to use a condom , but may change in a long term relationship . 
  * hometown : not at all * country : a little bit , mostly randstad vs countryside * europe : pretty different , but i think we agree on most topics , just not how we should work on them, 
  with ideal you get redirected to your bank , log in and confirm a payment and type in a confirmation number or you use your bank 's app , scan the qr code of the payment and use your touch id . 
  i personally do n't own a credit card , because i usually do n't need it . 
  just a debit card has worked for me so far , but i wish that ideal or a similar service worked eu-wide, 
  hmm , poland comes to mind , because my polish friend once talked to me about a whole tradition with dating and love and marriage . 
  something with melting stuff , pouring it through a lock and then finding something related to your future husband . 
  i was told this like 4 years ago . 
  i do n't remember it very well . 
  you make a good point . 
  i wanted to write fennoscandia , but thought that 'd be too geographically nerdy, 
  stay ignorant . 
  you keep making up statements without backing them up . 
  there is no cure for stupidness . 
  i thought reading it was a thing in whole scandinavia , but oh well , go finland !, 
  okay , let 's consider your argument for an extra moment . 
  where are you getting that data from ? 
  because that argument is horribly bad . 
  there are more humans than ever before , which is a strong argument against `` i do n't want to bring kids into a shitty world . '', 
  [ now it 's actually better ! ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/whats-the-best-time-in-history-to-be-born-2014-9?international=true&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t ) . 
  [ extra stats on population ] ( https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/publications/files/wpp2017_keyfindings.pdf ) same goes for the social , technological and healthcare advances of now even compared to 100 years ago . 
  [ take a look at this ] ( https://ourworldindata.org/slides/war-and-violence/#/title-slide ) . 
  also , i think you 're hinting at declining birthrates and looking at europe/the west for `` i do n't want to bring kids into this shitty world . '', 
  reason therefore is the ever growing urbanisation . 
  more urbanisation means fewer kids per household , but `` more qualitative '' kids , meaning better educated . 
  iirc [ this teded ] ( https://www.ted.com/talks/stewart_brand_proclaims_4_environmental_heresies ) also highlights something with urbanisation . 
  i think you now proved that you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  there have never been more humans on earth , i think that 's the exact opposite of what you '' claim '' . 
  i think you 're not being very realistic . 
  i just found [ this article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22751415 ) on what i was thinking of . 
  i think this is a perfect idea !, 
  i highly recommend it . 
  as for `` a better world '' , that 's awfully subjective . 
  we 're at relative peace now and more prosperous and better educated than ever before , so saying that the education system and the rest of the world should make a huge change is costly , unrealistic and pretty stupid imho . 
  though there 's always room for improvement . 
  extra valentines-like-day per year and making motherhood more attractive , for example i think once pregnant/having a baby , with a box of goodies . 
  i think they have that in the nordic countries . 
  the parents will get a crib and stuff , i 'm not exactly sure , but monetary help , a workable crib , clothing and other useful stuff could be very useful . 
  i 'd love to travel there , but i prefer to wait for things to calm down . 
  the most pleasant experience i 've had where with europeans above the age of 50 . 
  always so sweet and caring and lovely customers . 
  i think it 's a smart business endeavour , but if you mean feudalism style , then it 's pretty bad for the workers/people that live there , i think . 
  depends on how luxurious your lifestyle is . 
  i think $ 1k - $ 1,3 k should be possible, 
  countrywide , only 318 people have my last name !, 
  and apparently 432 have the same maiden name as my mom , despite her family being from abroad lol, 
  a bunch of peasants , farmers and a few college grads vs the british empire is not nothing . 
  say what you will about the americans , but the independence war is an amazing accomplishment . 
  2010 world cup, 
  i think this is one of the most specific posts i 've seen on this sub in a while, 
  no , because i do n't know what kinda date you 'd need . 
  doubt anyone makes predictions besides economic growth and maybe the conjunctuurklok here in the netherlands, 
  eurostat or their national statistics agency, 
  i do n't care about them . 
  if they follow the law , do their part in society and cause no troubles , anyone 's fine by me . 
  our mountains best mountains, 
  it was listed under the ajuntament 's * festes i tradicions * so i just made it festival for easiness haha, 
  girona ( in catalonia , spain ) has the [ festival of the flowers ] ( http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;nv=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ca&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.gironatempsdeflors.cat/cat/inici.php&amp;usg=alkjrhggf1ugwjp9f03pgfofuciwekfqzw ) annually . 
  do n't know if you mean something like that , plus this year 's festival has already happened . 
  might be worthy for next year . 
  the [ wiki ] ( https://ca.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/temps_de_flors ) looks better than the official page , but is only in catalan . 
  i believe that university is free in slovenia . 
  not a lot , maybe a couple of times at uni , but i 'm like 78 % certain it 's the same girl haha, 
  it 's pretty good, 
  i wan na say jody bernal for some reason, 
  because it 's not a national holiday here, 
  i worked, 
  it 's legal and i do n't care about gambling . 
  there should be certain restrictions . 
  it 's better to have it be legal and have restriction than letting it be a black market phenomenon . 
  we have a newspaper and social media i guess . 
  sometimes , i fantasise it would be fun hearing the church bells and rushing to a local square and have a market or something or watch a festival . 
  would be fun , maybe 1x a month . 
  all your land is belong to us . 
  i like middle eastern people . 
  i feel related to them , due to my turkish roots . 
  i 've only had positive experiences . 
  i love the history there , for example persia and ancient egypt . 
  when i 'm with my dede at a turkish/iranian/iraqi restaurant i feel like wearing clothes like in the 20s and watch belly dancers haha . 
  despite that , i think the instability , religion and culture have held the place back . 
  hope it improves . 
  no , but they seem useful in lisbon . 
  it 's not like i could easily cycle there in town , with all the mountains . 
  i never go there so i do n't know , but i do n't really care either lol, 
  that 's ok , it 's from my teacher and research from geert hofstede . 
  it 's what i adhere too , as it has pretty logical reasons in the book , for example when meeting a new , potential client , i would n't ask anything about their love life . 
  i do n't think that 's american . 
  i learned this in cultural differences class . 
  i personally do n't mind talking about said subjects , however , it 's a guideline for talking to strangers from abroad initially . 
  you 're only screwed if you make the atmosphere awkward . 
  it 's not like your young kids saying `` penis '' for the first time . 
  there are , in general , 3 topics you do n't discuss with strangers : * politics * religion * sex ( basically any subjective/controversial stuff ) . 
  for jeans i usually enjoy pme legend , but for other items , i do n't care . 
  i think that , in general , the asian minority as a whole is a good example of a minority . 
  they start businesses , have quite well-educated children and pay taxes .
