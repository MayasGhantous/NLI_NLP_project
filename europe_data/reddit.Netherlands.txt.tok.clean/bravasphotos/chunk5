  i think china has always been a major super power . 
  if it has persisted for so many millennia , it wo n't change now . 
  better to work with them , i think . 
  i think europe should be more self-sufficient and more powerful anyway , but some things like cheap labour are inescapable . 
  better to focus on our knowledge economies in europe . 
  this specific op tends to ask pretty dumb questions , imho . 
  british english . 
  i care a lot , because if i used american english in my reports , i 'd auto-fail the report . 
  so i care , like , a lot . 
  i like patatas bravas , i like photography . 
  i hope not . 
  seems really retarded . 
  i 'm dating an american girl , so it should be possible, 
  we had this dumbass class called `` maatschappijleer '' ( civil education , is a sort of translation ) . 
  the contents and what it was supposed to teach was pretty good , like the structure of government , national values and how the government works , but it was such a waste of time . 
  i usually ended up learning more from either talking with friends and family , or teachers that side tracked when something big happened in the world . 
  i do n't really have an opinion about it . 
  nice flag . 
  idk same as ever . 
  still annoying and loud but some more seats, 
  that 's one helluva question, 
  dutch : kerel, 
  coffee with milk & some breakfast juice . 
  the cafeteria at uni tbh . 
  it 's so poorly designed , it annoys me everyday . 
  yeah , i went for an internship to barcelona and loved it . 
  only thing erasmus did for me was providing me with some money . 
  they did n't do much else for me , but neither did i really do any investigation into it . 
  i later learned there is this kind of erasmus bar like across razzmatazz , but i did n't like it * that * much . 
  though my homeboy sneaked in a huge bottle of jack daniels , haha . 
  good times . 
  i once read that there are about 35k erasmus kids alive . 
  fun stuff . 
  i mean , i definitely recommend going out to parties and have sex ( ** be safe tho ** ) , but it 's all about your own attitude . 
  surround yourself with people you like/want to be and do what you like . 
  all i can recommend is : become a local . 
  seems accurate , 
  i had the nyc types in mind , with all the straight roads and stuff . 
  european cities are far nicer to me , but i can appreciate symmetrie and long roads without corners . 
  i 'm not familiar with all the terms , but maternity and paternity leave , healthcare , infrastructure , taxation , income and employee rights are big ones . 
  the military is n't restricted to individuals . 
  yes , there are assholes in the armed forces , but americans also played a major part in the liberation of europe . 
  that 's a human issue . 
  some civilians also kill and rape . 
  there 's the law and the enforcement of the law to ensure the best for the most . 
  it does n't always work , but in general it works pretty good . 
  man , europe is *** incredibly *** different on both national and international levels . 
  i recommend checking out geert hofstede 's website . 
  i 'd link it if i were n't on mobile . 
  i like * some * aspects of the us , but in general , it 's not to my liking . 
  it highly depends on where you 're from as well , but in general , it 's not for me . 
  i think i could write a book on it , but i 'll keep it to some bullet points : * us culture is far more individualistic ; * i do n't like the ` bragging ' involved in applications and resume ( or in general life ) ; * i do like the respect for soldiers and the constitution ; * i do n't like the politics ( no party seems ok to me ) ; * i like that cities are generally well planned ; * social stuff is lagging quite a lot ; * i do n't like the live to work attitude . 
  dreuge worst , set of wooden shoes and a copy of everything ede staal , that 's for sure, 
  my gut tells me germany . 
  it has a pretty solid history in film and art , but if the market is any profitable is hard to say . 
  might wan na check eurostat on statistics for that . 
  not very sure about this , but i 'm almost certain provinces do n't have as much influence as they do in the us , which i think is good . 
  the us is also a federal state , and so is germany , but the netherlands is a constitutional monarchy . 
  i think it highly depends on government structure too . 
  afaik , the national government \u201e grants '' certain privileges and rights or gives certain tasks to provincial and municipal institutions . 
  england is my city , i highly recommend that too . 
  yeah , i think the education system will help you get fluent . 
  i think it 'd depend more on personal motivation and interest though . 
  english classes definitely helped , but imho subs on games and tv definitely helped as well . 
  i speek ferry goed inglish, 
  doubt it . 
  i think south europe would be the place for that , such as santiago de compostela , rome and florence . 
  the catholic countries tend to have the relics and stuff . 
  * she 's a super freak , super freak *, 
  yes . 
  i think it starts at age 10 `` officially '' . 
  i did . 
  it was pretty good . 
  would n't [ this ] ( https://i.redd.it/ub1wi3wdvm2z.jpg ) give it away ? 
  the top part should then be netherlands tho , 
  lisboa is derived from ancient phoenician meaning `` good harbour '', 
  i do n't even have perfect native accent from the languages i learnt in childhood haha, 
  what is protected speech ? 
  if you mean right to have an opinion and stuff , it 's in the constitution . 
  i use goeuro to usually check travel options . 
  works pretty well in my experience . 
  wtf are you talking about lmao, 
  profitable for the eu of course . 
  i 'll take the women , thank you very much \u2642, 
  not really popular here . 
  i wan na go oil wrestling in turkey tho . 
  southern european and middle eastern , boiiiii, 
  know some spanish-filipinos . 
  they 're cool . 
  was the only blanco at the b-day party . 
  shit , they drink jack daniels like it 's water . 
  they 're very nice people that can cook really well !, 
  do n't see many filipinos here in the netherlands tho . 
  they blow up atms in germany , steal cars and drive really fast over the border and sometimes end up crashing , i think, 
  define `` over there '', 
  i do n't care about either , really , but i did once learn that israel shares highly confidential stuff about terrorists so i might lean more towards them , if i were a head of state . 
  i once read that the luchtalarm is disappearing , sadly . 
  i see you 're a man of culture as well, 
  probably overhyped and seems quite annoying to me . 
  i do n't know where you 're traveling from , but i would n't half-half it .
