  it 's a pretty good read . 
  [ pretty much my opinion on voltaire ] ( https://imgur.com/a/bihgi ) :p, 
  man , i love it . 
  i 'm very nationalistic , but i also feel connected to my region . 
  i wan na get a coat of arms this summer , but i 've got to work for that and hire an expert . 
  then i 'm gon na save to get a ring with the seal on it and use it to close letters and stuff . 
  very rarely , but it does n't bother me . 
  dude , you have like an entire month to renew it . 
  i think that we 're pleasantly ok with it , however , i think most of reddit becomes retarded when talking about religion , because they 're either 12 y/o enlightened edgelords or stuck up 30 y/o . 
  that 's , of course , a huge assumption , but people on reddit are generally bad at discussing religion . 
  yes , it has its good and bad sides . 
  get over it , lmao . 
  onion , mayonnaise , a tad of salt and sometimes curry/ketchup . 
  i 'd classify myself as an agnostic-atheist . 
  i wonder how vague the language will be . 
  it 'll be like panama papers , but in europe for cheap data . 
  me to me : `` come on , ya bastard , you had a midterm about this topic like three weeks ago , you should know this stuff longer than 3 days . '', 
  me to this post : `` well , there are three levels of vat : * 0 % for basic needs like medicine ( i think ) , * 6 % for stuff that are basically basic needs like books ( i think ) , * 21 % for luxury products like phones ( i 'm sure on this one ) . 
  i guess it can depend on the fact if you 're exporting , like a company then it 's 0 % in the eu or some other rules that i may/probably forgot . 
  dutch , english , german and spanish at uni, 
  i love me some old school , grand and almost over the top coas, 
  not gon na lie , i like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_kingdom_of_italy_%281929-1944%29.svg/779px-greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_kingdom_of_italy_%281929-1944%29.svg.png ) a bit more, 
  nice, 
  it is , especially the strawberry ones !, 
  it 's not really like orange juice , i 'd say . 
  [ this is what today 's one looks like ] ( https://imgur.com/a/8kmt1 ), 
  there are these ` breakfast drinks ' with fruits and fiber of 3/4 litre and they 're pretty good . 
  if i 'll have a long day , usually 2 slices of oberlander bread , butter , cheese and salami, 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the ksk , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on al-quaeda , and i have over 300 confirmed kills . 
  i am trained in gorilla warfare and i 'm the top sniper in the entire german armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another target . 
  i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across germany and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my bare hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the ksk and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , kiddo . 
  yeah , because it is like  200x bigger , but size of a country does not equal to wealth and prosperity lol, 
  perhaps more connections with other eu unis . 
  mine , for example , has like 18 spanish partner universities and just a handful in slavic countries, 
  not really . 
  we 're doing fine here , of course after any war , immigration to another country might seem more useful , but that 's always a difficult decision to made . 
  we 've had our ` influx ' of immigrants over time too , which allowed us to get very rich . 
  smart people trying to become successful in a country where they 'd have better chances . 
  that 's what immigration is all about and i ca n't fault a person for doing it , only applaud . 
  well , it is , but it 's not like i know the states from the top of my head, 
  yeah , a lot . 
  i do n't even remember all of their names , but when i read their stories , i 'm always impressed . 
  i 'm a sucker for frederick the great , even though he wrote the anti-machiavel , whilst in general i 'm a great machiavellian enthusiast . 
  of course names as the virgin queen , napoleon ( thalleyrand ftw ! ), 
  and atat\u00fcrk are some of the more familiar ones , i do like the kings and queens and rulers of italian renaissance states . 
  diplomacy , sex and war , what better than that ? 
  florence is definitely the fashion city, 
  yeah and no , lol, 
  cute : spanish , french and italian . 
  horrible : every other language . 
  i 'd really be for another type of v-day per year , somewhere in august or whatever . 
  if it hits off , it 's good for the economy and birth rates . 
  plus , who does n't enjoy sex ? 
  have you always wanted to visit n korea , but do n't want to die in a death camp ? 
  well , you 're in luck !, 
  tarragona , a city not far from barcelona , houses [ the world 's only n korean bar ] ( http://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2016/08/16/tarragona-north-korean-themed-bar/ ) !, 
  i think that the mistake that you make is that you link revolts to individuals . 
  though revolts usually happen at the hands of a certain group , for example the revolution in russia or the nationalists in spain , but that 's not entirely right . 
  franco did n't win the war , his ideology did and he was it 's greatest benefactor . 
  as for the reformation , [ i 'd say that it was pretty successful ] ( http://individual.utoronto.ca/hayes/canada/introduction.htm ) . 
  i do n't fully understand your final sentence . 
  they did n't really want to prove science wrong , they used science , a lot . 
  sometimes though , it was fabricated to suit their ideology , which is more in the area of pseudoscience . 
  hmm , i do n't really understand the message of your comment . 
  sure , there were revolts and protests in the german states and the later formed germany , but that 's besides the point , i think . 
  how exactly did the unsuccessful revolts influence history ? 
  the protestant reformation , for example , was a revolt of its kind , which saw lots of turmoil in europe , but it was quite successful . 
  when the nazis tried to overthrow the state to institute their regime failed , it was unsuccessful . 
  only after hitler came into power , his administration became what its known for . 
  his time in jail certainly affected him , but it would n't dramatically alter his personality . 
   how do you think all the benefits you enjoy were gained ? 
  in regards to everything above that phrase , i 'll repeat myself : yes , you are right , there were attempts to institute communist governments in west and south europe . 
  i did n't deny that , i just said that they were all unsuccessful , which is my point . 
  as to the rest of your comment :  how do you think all the benefits you enjoy were gained ? 
  by gently asking our masters if they can spare a penny ? 
  by saying this you are ignoring the blood spiiled by thousands that fought for us to have what we have . 
  do you think the 8 hours workday was obtained peacefully ? 
  or security measures on the work place ? 
  do you think public health care was simply a coincidence ? 
  there was money laying around so might as well cure the poor with it , i guess . 
  the way we conduct business has changed many years , for example by humanists like erasmus . 
  communism definitely does ** not ** take care of its citizens and workers in reality as its ideology sounds like on paper . 
  compare russia , china and north korea to italy , denmark and the netherlands , and compare where the lives of the people and workers is better . 
  yes , it certainly took time for we started to regulate capitalism , but that does ** not ** mean that any other economic systems are any better . 
  there is a clear difference . 
  for these reforms , we have men and women like adam smith , who discovered that the division of labour of labour far exceeds the use of slaves . 
   do you think it was just a coincidence that fascist regimes popped up in countries whose ecomonies were destroyed or close to collapse ?
