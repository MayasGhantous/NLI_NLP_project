  do you think that fascists and nazis had actually popular support and not just an instrument of the elite to maintain their power ? 
  fascism happens where the people are mostly uneducated , in need of a scapegoat or there are deep troubles that go way back . 
  turkey 's economy , for example , is quite decent . 
  officially there is no dictator , but we 've got to read between the lines on that one . 
   every law protecting the worker was paid in blood and suffering and you are so blind in your own little world that you pretend this is n't true . 
  you think they failed ? 
  if they really did you would be living in a capitalist paradise that would make the us look like the ussr . 
  go read some history . 
  i 've read the wealth of nations almost fully and i 'm planning to read das kapital to better understand marxism . 
  in fact , i urge you to put aside your partisanship and ignorance and read more history books . 
  mao 's and stalin 's reign have cost millions their lives . 
  according to [ history of russia ] ( http://historyofrussia.org/stalin-killed-how-many-people/ ) , stalin 's administration was responsible for 20 million deaths and mao 's for 40 million . 
  2/5 from that list were communists and are the top two , one is fascist , one was feudal and only one was capitalist . 
  the capitalist set out mass murders due to reasons other than economic systems  now you are aware that the school of life is a social democrat platform right ? 
  and you are aware than adam smith was far more towards the left than a lot of people think ? 
  adam smith defined the free market as a market free from the control of the people and said that was a bad thing . 
  he also said that the most violent and bloody governments are the ones run by merchants . 
  he also stated that a government whose sole responsibility is to defend private property is simply an institution to defend the rich from the poor . 
  he also defended workers ' unions and condemned attempts at dismantling them . 
  i never said that the school of life and adam smith were ** not ** left wing . 
  in fact , it does n't matter whether they are or not . 
  what matters is that they are right , and there are things we do n't need a political compass for , like this . 
  if albert einstein said that we was a fascist , would that invalidate his scientific research ? 
  your arguments are invalid . 
  also , just because i 'm pro capitalist , does n't mean i 'm evil , lol . 
  i 'm all for [ corporate social responsibility ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporate_social_responsibility ) . 
  like the separation of power in government , the people and the businesses must keep each other in check . 
  i do n't mind unions at all . 
   oh and he mentions the invisible hand exactly one time in the wealth of nations . 
  such a great defender of capitalism is n't he ? 
  `` in the left corner , we have adam smith , representing capitalism . 
  in the right corner , we have stalin , defending communism . 
  the former is a philosopher , carrying 0 deaths to his name in defence of his ideology , the latter is the crusader that represents ` the workers ' and is directly responsible for 20 million deaths in defence for his ideology ... let 's get ready to ... 
  rumble ! '', 
  perhaps you may not be aware , later in my comment i recommend not one , but two great sources for why capitalism works . 
  the school of life 's video is about 12 minutes and a great watch . 
  it 'll help you learn more about it , rather than taking one sentence from the entire comment . 
  that 's just bad effort on your part . 
  yes , there were communists active in european politics , but they just never had power . 
  that 's what it 's all about . 
  the spanish civil war was between nationalists and republicans , not about economic systems entirely . 
  franco was called `` the leader of the war of liberation against communism and its accomplices . '', 
  you can read that on franco 's wiki . 
  does that sound communist to you ? 
  as for the paris commune , i do n't know too much about that . 
  it must have failed , because france is one of the g7 members , which are all well-off capitalist counties . 
  communists revolts are useless , like any ( unsuccessful ) revolt . 
  nazis ruled germany , and they quickly obliterated the communists . 
  when germany was divided , yes , there was a communist germany . 
  it failed . 
  revolts do n't mean influence . 
  they have little power , just some public support . 
  as for italy , the same goes as france . 
  trying is useless if you do n't succeed . 
  i must say that my original comment was n't an essay on the useless romance of communism . 
  it was like , what , < 100 words , lol . 
  edit : it was actually 112 words , haha . 
  i had religious classes on a public school for about a year , just an hour or two per week . 
  it was mostly about the values the bible teaches and how other religions work . 
  then , at secondary school , i had more religious classes , because it was a roman catholic school , but it was mostly watching films like the blind side . 
  because nazism had a direct result on many ( richer ) european countries . 
  communism is a big failure as well , but people romanticise it , for example that the poor street boy becomes equal to the wealthy businessman . 
  that just does n't work . 
  furthermore , it never had a direct impact on wealthy european countries , namely the west and the south . 
  the nazis dismissed the idea of capitalism and strove to achieve complete self sufficiency . 
  they 'd chose whatever economic system they ought best , but there is none . 
  the best work on why capitalism is the utmost superior system is adam smith 's the wealth of nations and [ the school of life ] ( http://youtu.be/diuaw9ywqeu ) . 
  there are many types of capitalism . 
  yeah , it 's called ` bureau krediet registratie ' and it 's mandatory by law that every use of credit is registered there . 
  i 've only ever dated foreign girls . 
  there were many cultural difference , mostly about the close family relations . 
  i do n't keep in touch with my family too much , outside of my parents , but my at the time girlfriend was really close to everyone . 
  really miss that sense of love . 
  i do n't know , if you 've got a healthy bmi and maybe have a few roles , i 'd worry more about how you approach some cuties rather than how you look . 
  do n't forget bracelets, 
  everybody cares about weight . 
  overweight and obese people are by nature unattractive and unhealthy , so yeah , people care about what you look like . 
  that said , just because you 've got a few rolls does n't mean you ca n't chat up some girls . 
  from school , at home and general interest . 
  '' ... radical views ... '' dis gon be gud have n't read the article fully , because i 'm not interested enough , but any person that is described as radical , is probably wrong . 
  radicalism never works , always moderation . 
  that also goes in politics . 
  really ? 
  never heard of that rule . 
  it just looks ugly after cents , so as an executive decision , i removed it forever . 
  i have never seen a native dutch write 2,50 $ , perhaps in international stores run by international people , but never a native dutch . 
  $ 2,50 is obviously ** superior ** in every single way . 
  2,50 $ does n't look good at all . 
  it 's alternative price listing . 
  sad !, 
  * commas , not full stops : $ 2,50  $ 2.40 . 
  full stops are for big numbers $ 1.000 * $ 2,50 - is how i learned it , but the ' - ' does n't look good . 
  too bad brazil is n't here now . 
  anyways , catapults are n't airplanes \u274c, 
  meant germany , added it in original comment . 
  erasmus is cool and all , but the general proficiency in german is very low . 
  probably more cultural an educational exchange with germany . 
  i feel like bullying is rare or at least not a common thing in most schools or at least in decent neighbourhoods . 
  never heard an american call europe a soviet dictatorship , lol, 
  australia for some reason,
