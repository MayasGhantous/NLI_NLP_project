  if you do n't like it then stay away . 
  thanks !, 
  in this case they could choose to not be scumbags . 
  it 's not as if they never got any warnings . 
  if people just refuse to behave and keep creating problems , then what else can you do ? 
  how is istanbul safe and organised enough for this ? 
  seeing the country is still a huge political mess with huge secularism issues . 
  what if by 2020 the islamists come back into power ? 
  will they tolerate all those female athletes ? 
  it will be a huge mess . 
   such is life . 
  but seriously , latvia potato jokes are the best and darkest humour of all nation/people stereotype jokes i see on reddit . 
  such hardships and desolation , but then to be happy with a simple thing like a potato . 
  or when there is n't one ( or it is rotten ) then there is still the recognition of the harsh , uncaring realities of life . 
  and who knows , tomorrow there is another day , maybe it brings potato . 
  what do latvian think about these jokes in general ? 
  it it just outsider sillyness or is it some observed caricature ? 
  but then there was an actual war going on with the nazi 's who owned hamburg , while that freedom fries was just for not supporting the us own war plans . 
  similar , but not quite the same . 
  would you like some freedom fries with that ? 
  because french fries are too unpatriotic . 
  wonder why ? 
  check http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2051879/ it 's pretty good lowish-budget realistic sf , similar in style to moon and apollo 18 . 
  an acquaintance found the article i remembered ( dutch language ) . 
  it looks like one of the earlier linked articles is quote-translating this one . 
  surprise !, 
  a weird financial construction that mostly benefits the banks and pumps air everywhere else . 
  the dutch intelligence services know how to work around that : if you are n't allowed to spy on your own citizens you can instead help the foreign agencies do it ( like prism ) and then get the information though that partnership , so technically you are not breaking the rule . 
  and because that partnership super-secret nobody can check what is going on . 
  the original article was an a proper news site too , but it is nowhere to be found . 
  maybe the moles ate it  / s, 
  ~ ~ i have a hard time find the exact articles regarding the backdoor moles : it was on a big news site ( nu.nl or automatiseringgids.nl or similar ) but google gives me nothing . 
  ( scary  ~ ~ *** update *** have n't found the original source , but i did found some mentions of it : this : http://investmentwatchblog.com/dutch-intelligence-has-access-to-prism-reveals-existence-of-moles-in-companies/ links to this http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2013/06/dutch_security_service_has_rec.php that has this tiny bit :  dutch companies also cooperated with the us authorities ' request for information , the source said , claiming that ` there are *** agents ready to deal with requests for information inside companies and institutions *** . ' ------- original comment : on my search i did find these closely related ones ( dutch language ) : aivd bypassing local wiretap laws by using prism data ( they are n't allowed to do this kind of bulk collection themselves , but they source it from prism : http://www.automatiseringgids.nl/nieuws/2013/27/bof-pleit-voor-internetbewaking tracer sms usage , rules unclear , no fucks given : http://www.automatiseringgids.nl/nieuws/2013/34/bof-sterk-gekant-tegen-stiekeme-sms lack of transparency and evasive behaviour from ams-ix over taps : http://www.automatiseringgids.nl/nieuws/2013/26/kamer-eisen-openheid-over-tap-bij-ams-ix agencies tapping inside companies , nobody knows what they do : http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/binnenland/article/detail/3471627/2013/07/06/spionagepraktijken-in-de-vs-kijk-eerst-eens-naar-nederland.dhtml i 'll keep looking for the one on the moles , as it was a major shocker all around ( it sparked the creation of [ this image ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/netherlands/comments/1g4ley/wie_is_de_mol/ ) ) . 
  indeed , the local eu agencies are as bad as the american ones . 
  i 'm still angry about the story about the dutch aivd partnering with the english and american agencies . 
  they even use moles recruited or planted in telecom companies to pull data the law says they are n't supposed to have . 
  so not only are our own laws worth jack shit , they just ignore them when they feel like it or get pressured by external parties . 
  i 'd advise anyone against using dutch hosting . 
  also the up-n-coming anonymous startpage search engine will be fucked any day now . 
  they recently added perfect-forward-secrecy , which is nice , but worth dick of their connection gets forcibly proxied and resigned with a fake certificate using a root certificate from foreign masters . 
  looks like a fat fish . 
  you are only making it worse !, 
  * facts !, 
  * ocd much ? 
  seriously , i 'm not even going to argue . 
  yes , because you are derailing the discussion . 
  the article was not about maffia , it was about potential extremely serious power abuse and rights violations . 
  the mafia bit was only a figure of speech . 
  it was wrong , agreed , but completely off topic . 
  thanks to your comment and those nitwits up-voting and reacting to it the top of the thread sidetracks into a popular history of the mafia , instead of the potential gross abuse of power , rise of the police state and intimidation of journalists . 
  stay on topic please . 
  instead of drivelling about a single figure of speech you could focus on the apparent violation of rights and abuse of powers . 
  * or else we 'll use ... 
  i have these dreams too , but sometimes i also have a nightmare of dreadful bureaucracy and lost freedoms . 
   mail.ru . ru ? 
  i 'm not so sure that would be a good idea . 
  but then what is ? 
  my own country 's spy agency is notorious for getting all data from all local providers , legally . 
  and when they can not get it legally they use moles to slip data out . 
  this is even true for hosted servers , those are subject to same regulations and mole infestation . 
  ca n't trust anyone . 
  what sucks so enormously is how my whole on-line identity is tied to my gmail . 
  i 'm thinking about switching it but it 'll be drama . 
  it 's not just changing it in al my accounts , it is also hard coded in many gt repos and other non-changable data . 
  yes because russia and china companies are so reliable and trustworthy and accountable with legal action when it turns out they slurp all your personal data traffic . 
  all the serious paedophiles are on tor/union so good luck with that . 
  i think for many politicians the 1984 world is very attractive . 
  more power and less interference by the public . 
  remember the 5th of november ? 
  estonia is like the scandinavian pub . 
  never seen so many drunk scandinavians as in tallinn . 
  they lure you with the smell of fresh roasted beans but kill you with a full-fat quatro latte with cream and chocolate hearth attack . 
  it 's a pun , or play on words . 
  which is odd since they then would spy on their own countrymen and still help the nsa because their governments are usa 's spybitch . 
  i love how you know everything and look into the future . 
  nsa got a lot more money then cern . 
  it 's only a scale factor and that is solvable . 
  you do n't know what a tape storage vault is ? 
  this is how they store lhc data at cern : http://inapcache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/lhc_11_20/l12_00809016.jpg edit : here 's more about that , they 're also busting 5 petabytes soon : http://home.web.cern.ch/about/computing, 
  what about tape ? 
  it 's not one huge blob of 5 zetabytes but a collection of systems with a total of 5 zetabytes when it 's finished somewhere in the future . 
  it 's not about ` right now ' . 
  and who said it all had too be harddisks ? 
  who said it 's all directly accessible ? 
  oracle had a commercial tape solution that scales up to 1 exabytes few years ago . 
  that 's one system already close to factor 1000 range . 
  with a facility of that size and so much money available 5 zetabytes is easily reachable . 
  stop making ridiculous claims over technology , you have no idea . 
  there is the motivation and plenty of money . 
  it 's only a problem of scale . 
   it is impossible to obtain such capacity right now do n't be na\u00efve , it 's only a matter of scale . 
  `` just because i 'm paranoid does n't mean they 're not out to get me ! '', 
  or the conspiracy to call conspiracy on things they do n't like and hope it goes away . 
  where is the money in this ? 
  who gains from this ? 
   currently , the spanish parliament is debating a law designed to promote bullfighting as cultural heritage . 
  in practice , this would mean more public funding for the bullfighting industry and the promotion of bullfighting to young children . 
  omfg !, 
  i need to get away from the computer and burry my head in sand , all this is getting too much . 
  i 'm pretty sure every country has a spy network and is tapping way more then people suspected .
