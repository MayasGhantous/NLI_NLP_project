maybe he just likes brazil . 
   why is the netherlands so rich ? 
  [ google answered that one for me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lioo3xl.png ), 
  cargo 200, 
  at least they 're not fucking them . 
  `` you thought our roads were bad ? 
  wait until you see our nuclear reactors ! '', 
  no , you do n't understand . 
  we 're just too * politically correct * , that 's why turkey and its neighbors rank so high and we do n't !, 
   right now they 're saying `` the association agreement will not lead to a full membership '' , but we all know how it works . 
  an example ? 
  turkey is a one of why the opposite is true . 
  it simply can not meet the criteria , neither does ukraine at this moment . 
  if ukraine were to somehow meet those criteria in regards to their economy , human rights and so on in let 's say 20 years , then why not ? 
  to my knowledge , we , as any other country , can also veto the accession of a country to the eu . 
  i 'd take into account that it 's not like ukraine in its entirety is at war though . 
   oh yeah , give the russians the land they want . 
  russia will never back down ; this will only result in more casualties . 
  really ? 
  this is just immature . 
  that ukraine deals with a lot of corruption is * obvious * , but the european union has a lot more leverage in dealing with those untouchables than your average ukrainian does . 
  this way of thinking is so short-sighted . 
  perhaps we could 've made it easier for them * and * us to offer things if we had some sort of * agreement * that would improve trade and relations in the long run . 
   tl ; dr : `` hey , we kinda miss that vast , open area to destroy in a war ** provoked by us ** without having to risk - in that order - our industry , our cities , and our population '' i do n't understand . 
  what do you mean ? 
  and how is a stable europe not primarily in the interest of ... european countries ? 
  we 're all on the same continent and simply ignoring the elephant or bear in the room will only make it worse . 
  the u.s. mostly pays for europe 's defenses , whether you like it or not , they helped a lot the past century . 
  from rebuilding to defending eastern europe . 
  the piggy bank for nato is also [ almost entirely filled with american money ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-31619553 ) . 
  it 's unfair to tell them go away when your leaders need them to help do the job for you in e.g. 
  libya . 
   the man whose identity was not revealed by haberdar was later arrested by a ** penal court of peace ** , controversial courts established by the justice and development party ( ak party ) just sugar coating it by adding * peace * to it does n't make it so . 
  that 's on the level of the * democratic people 's republic * of korea . 
  it 's not meant to be insulting , as i think the names are funny , but digfishhead ( ? ), 
  sounds like a bottled drink from chernobyl to me . 
  those names really are interesting . 
  that 's why i am asking for clarification from his perspective , it is a sincere question . 
  most europeans that are here , such as polish , [ barely make use of the welfare system ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2015/31/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand ) to my knowledge . 
  i really do n't know what it 's like in britain and which european migration specifically taxes the , for example , british welfare system as you mentioned . 
   czechia , hungary , poland , slovakia , romania , estonia , latvia , lithuania , croatia i believe , from another article . 
  wish i could read the actual letter that was sent to the juncker \u2122 though . 
  i did not downvote you , but out of curiousity , what are your exact problems with this unrestricted immigration from european countries ? 
  i thought britain had more problems with pakistani muslims ? 
  or which domestic law exactly was overwritten that you disagreed with ? 
  i think we had something here regarding net neutrality that got weakened in that sense . 
  some brits sound like some dutch do to me , some ca n't accept the world is n't all what it used to be in the past , with countries such as china and others now competing . 
   idiots are just trying to use social media pressure to embarrass her . 
  seems she 's perfectly capable of emberassing herself by comparing the migrant crisis to auschwitz . 
  yeah , same story here . 
  they were called gastarbeiders here ( gastarbeiters in germany i believe ) . 
  it seems very difficult to solve this problem now . 
  from my observations there is quite an amount of segregation in schools over the country . 
  i ca n't say for sure , without anything to back it up , but the impact of not mingling with native dutch children on language proficiency seems like something that would influence it a lot . 
   reason one : `` it 's not acceptable for people to cover their faces in public so that they ca n't be recognised . '' really ? 
  so should we ban men wearing hoodies or face-concealing crash helmets ? 
  they attempted to ban that here , but unfortunately failed to my knowledge . 
  obviously people should take off face-concealing helmets when they 're not on a motorcycle . 
   reason four : `` it 's important to be able to identify people , and you ca n't do that if you ca n't see their face . '' true , so in those circumstances -- in airports or police stations or court-rooms , for example -- where identities need to be checked , ** you can easily make arrangements to enable women with covered faces to reveal themselves in a private place ** . 
  ( we do n't expect women travellers at airports to be body-checked by men , so if their wishes can be met , why not those of niqab-wearers ? ), 
  how about we stop the special treatment for those that want nothing to do with western society ? 
  probably , at hbo level i had people who did vwo too but still did not understand it at all . 
  one even told me it was `` hij gooid '' , because the `` i '' is in '' ' t kofschip '', 
  yeah , we needed unskilled labor at the time ( '60s ) and they thought they 'd just return home like the spanish and italian workers did , so why focus on making them learn the language and treat them as future permanent citizens , the opposite was the case as the government thought it 'd make it easier for them to return home . 
  i have no faith in the current government either . 
  one from the labour party ( pvda ) [ claimed ] ( http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/12/30/netherlands-can-take-200000-more-asylum-seekers-says-labour-leader/ ) we could probably take in 200.000 . 
  i doubt the [ syrians , afghanis , iraqis , eritreans ] ( https://www.coa.nl/nl/over-coa/cijfers-en-jaarverslagen ) will be a [ net contributor ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2015/31/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand ) to society in the future . 
  bit of a sensationalist headline , but what indeed has always baffled me about our laws regarding coffeeshops is how they are forced to get the products they sell in a not so legal manner . 
  it just does not make sense to let it be produced in an illegal manner [ by the not so fortunate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pjm2mshyii#t=1h9m50s ) . 
  so is this like the russian version of [ operation gladio ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_gladio ) ? 
  the thing that cracks me up the most is how the people that voted now demand it is binding , while it 's just an advisory one . 
  it 's cool with me !, 
  it 'll only help europe compete in the long run . 
   what exact benefit does being white give ? 
  people do n't discriminate anymore . 
  companies look at your resum\u00e9 , here , not at your skincolour . 
  that 's just not true and you know it as a dutch person . 
  * [ ing calling a black guy a crook ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2014/03/ing_describes_economics_studen/ ) * [ electronics store stating ` first of all , he 's a negro ' ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2013/11/electrical_goods_shop_blunders/ ) really , there are hundreds of examples i can come up with . 
  moroccans to not be invited just because of their names for example , that applies to eastern europeans too . 
  define our dutch culture by the way . 
  are the people from surinam , indonesia , who were exploited , not a part of it ? 
  ha , i suppose some believe it to be a binding referendum , not an advisory one . 
  edit : really , downvotes ? 
  some of you are that salty ? 
   emotions ... fear mongering really ? 
  as if the * no * campaign did n't have the biggest role in that . 
  http://www.nrc.nl/next/2016/03/30/duurzaamheid-tweede-kamer-neemt-omstreden-motie-aa-1605307 it 's not a complete ban as is claimed by the article . 
  the first proposal indeed was for a ban . 
  d66 and sp however did not agree on that , so now it states that they 'll simply aim to hit the target of zero cars being sold by 2025 . 
  a lot less ambitious and not a complete ban . 
  dictating less and not more , maybe that is the way to ... not be called a dictator in the first place ? 
  so grimsby 's home to master splinter ? 
  yeah , but that 's the race to the bottom . 
  companies using foreign workers due to a supply of people who are willing to work while those companies are : * paying them less than the legal minimum wage * not abiding by the collective labor agreements regarding safety , breaks and so on ... 
  it happens every so often that companies are exposed for doing these things . 
  of course companies will then be less interested in hiring let 's say a dutch truck driver who demands fair treatment . 
  i do n't think it is entirely an issue of * not willing * to work . 
  yeah , but we have a population of 17 million . 
  compared to germany or france we are dwarfs . 
   what 's your unemployment rate ?
