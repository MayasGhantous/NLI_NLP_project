  concerning the camps , the documentary [ night will fall ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbb9ncyzqvu ) really made me look differently at them due to the images i had not yet seen . 
  i highly suggest it to anyone interested !, 
  according to trump it is . 
  now i hear him say '' [ radical . 
  islamic . 
  terrorism . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/qzmlnd7rino ) '' once more . 
  thanks !, 
  have an upvote . 
   there are very few bosnians in the netherlands ... 
  they were sent back . 
  where are you getting this from ? 
  yeah , i posted too quickly , but at least some could have a laugh . 
  worth something . 
  yeah that was my bad , i responded too quickly . 
  my partner actually is from the area , so i fortunately do know what the flags of slovenia and slovakia look like . 
  hvala :-) my anger is directed at the administration and the people that support these ideas , so not all russians , that would be xenophobic . 
  frankly , i think it is a waste for all parties involved , but most importantly ukraine . 
  i would prefer to see a russia that abandons its hostile ways and takes on a more cooperative one towards the rest of europe , but that seems to be a naive thought for now . 
  my bad , but the similarity in flags applies to the similarity of opinions on this matter too . 
  i am surprised you did not feel the need to counter or add to any of the other points i raised . 
   i fully agree with fillon here how surprising for a russian . 
   it 's high time for some pragmatism . 
  perhaps removing troops would be one ? 
   it even sucks for russia because it is a drain on resources both due to direct costs and the toil of sanctions . 
  that is the point . 
  it should suck . 
  if it were up to me it would suck a lot more . 
   now you might say that none of this matters , russia is acting illegally and has to leave full stop , bla , bla , bla . 
  this ** may ** all be very good and true ** depending on your point of view ** there is no room for a `` may '' or `` point of view '' here . 
  it is and was illegal . 
   what may make russia leave is 1 ) shoving the crimea issue under the table and 2 ) a sustainable solution to the donbas crisis that envisions a clear degree of autonomy in donetsk and lugansk . 
  these demands are insane . 
  it is basically giving russia everything it wanted and leaving ukraine with nothing . 
   well , let 's ban driving then . 
  and cars ... i take the subway or walk , why am i forced to inhale your exhaust pipe ? 
  right !, 
  we 're sensible enough to start enforcing _ [ milieuzones ] ( https://www.milieuzones.nl/english ) _ , so they are banned in some cities . 
   i think it does matter . 
  big advantage to be fluent in some foreign languages , especially english . 
  ok , there will always be translators and the staff will be fluent , but still . 
  i watched [ an interview with her ] ( https://youtu.be/sqityvnjwjg?t=23 ) quite some time ago on dutch television and the host suddenly started speaking french . 
  really unusual and surprising . 
  i am not sure , rarely do we hear anything about her . 
  her name is krisztina marfai and they supposedly have been married since 1992 . 
  i could not find a good source that says she is anything else besides being hungarian . 
  thanks !, 
  i get it finland , you have to team up because we 've been beating you at those statistics lately !, 
  frankly , i 'd love a translation as / u/bozhidar _ madzharov mentioned . 
  alright , thanks !, 
  sad regardless , i ca n't imagine how this would make me feel as a father . 
  where did you read that they were muslims ? 
  i asked someone else too . 
   and yeah i might as well answer what everyone is thinking by saying that they are n't exactly your typical sven or emil . 
  were they ? 
  definitely , my intention was not to say that it applies to all countries and that all right-wing parties are not anti-semitic . 
  i have of course heard of kotleba , jobbik and so on . 
  i just wanted to note that a very stark contrast can be found in some countries . 
  / u/deep90km mentioned hofer 's view on isra\u00ebl , that was one i was unaware of . 
  oh yeah , in general you are probably right !, 
  i think we definitely are the exception among countries that have a right-wing party that favors isra\u00ebl to such an extent . 
  just felt the need to add the detail . 
   you have the far right who is openly anti semitic . 
  [ not ] ( https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/818086632624713729 ) [ really ] ( https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/814205593904939008 ) [ the ] ( https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/812401498747469824 ) [ case ] ( https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/801905450597961728 ) [ in ] ( https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/785204685854638084 ) [ the ] ( https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/737720025394630656 ) [ netherlands ] ( https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/679232710905303040 ) . 
  i personally voted for the association agreement with ukraine , but here 's some data for those that are interested . 
  most important reasons to vote for -- argument | frequency -- | -- to support the people of ukraine | 37.7 % economic advantages | 21,0 % right to vote | 7,9 % against russia or putin | 7,2 % for the eu | 6,7 % against those that organized the referendum | 1,5 % [ nationaal referendum onderzoek 2016 ] ( http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/813323/web_96646_onderzoeksrapport_nro_2016nw.pdf ) , p. 17 most important reasons to vote against -- argument | frequency -- | -- the corruption in ukraine | 34,1 % fear of ukraine becoming a member of the eu | 16,6 % vote against the eu | 7,5 % to not anger putin or russia | 4,5 % vote against the ( dutch ) government | 3,2 % right to vote | 2,3 % [ nationaal referendum onderzoek 2016 ] ( http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/813323/web_96646_onderzoeksrapport_nro_2016nw.pdf ) , p. 18, 
  how nice for our fellow european friends !, 
  unfortunately , last time i checked , they only accept credit cards or gift cards for those that live in the netherlands . 
  we are not that fond of credit cards here in general and mostly use our own service called [ ideal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ideal ) to pay for stuff online . 
  did this perhaps change ? 
  legitimate question , but what 's wrong with lebanon or jordan besides having to deal with the fallout of the crisis in syria/iraq ? 
  it 's _ just threats _ , really ? 
  it was an attack on our freedom of speech . 
  i 'm not sure if i follow , you do realize this note ( that threatened others ) was attached to a knife that was thrust into the body after he was murdered ? 
  i see no reason to discard such claims from a terrorist , who has said he will do it again if he were to ever be released -- which fortunately wo n't happen . 
   bouyeri cut van gogh 's throat with a large knife and tried to decapitate him , after which he stabbed the knife deep into van gogh 's chest , reaching his spinal cord . 
  he attached a note to the body with a smaller knife . 
  van gogh died on the spot . 
  the two knives were left implanted . 
  the note was addressed to and contained a death threat to ayaan hirsi ali , who went into hiding . 
  ** it also threatened western countries and jews , and referred to ideologies of the egyptian organization takfir wal-hijra . 
  the terrorist attack in which [ theo van gogh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theo_van_gogh_ ( film_director ) was murdered . 
  if you want to save time : he is not against nato . 
  you wo n't find much in his latest [ party program ] ( https://pvv.nl/index.php/visie.html ) , but -- as he mostly communicates using twitter -- you can read the two tweets that contain nato or navo ( noord-atlantische verdragsorganisatie in dutch ) [ here ] ( https://twitter.com/search?q=nato%20or%20navo%20from%3ageertwilderspvv&amp;src=typd ) . 
  translated :  1 . 
  turkey has to leave nato ( 2016 , 8th of august ) 2 . 
  just say no to nato , bring back home all dutch soldiers , we have contributed more than enough in afghanistan . 
  ( 2010 , 11th of february ) so , to sum it up : 1 . 
  he barely mentions it . 
  seems to be a proponent of the status quo , minus turkey . 
  from what i can see he was simply against the mission in afghanistan , not against nato itself . 
  concerning trump , all he said during an interview with [ de telegraaf ] ( http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/26987953/___trump_trouwe_navo-bondgenoot___.html?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=nieuwskoerier.nl ) was that trump will be a great president and that he understands why he made the nato comments , as trump is simply looking out for the interests of the american people , something he wishes more leaders would do . 
  ** edit : ** i found the [ party 's program ] ( https://www.pvv.nl/images/stories/verkiezingen2012/verkiezingsprogramma-pvv-2012-final-web.pdf ) from 2012 and it says the following ( pag . 
   ** english : ** nato will remain a cornerstone of our defense . 
  you did n't say it was `` not great '' or `` not my taste '' , but you said it was `` shitty '' and `` the equivalent of a powerpoint presentation '' , so do n't act surprised . 
  if facebook is going to act and be the provider on what news people will or will not consume using their algorithms , then perhaps they should at the very least be held to the same standard that other news agencies are . 
  will he assume [ his final form ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzbsetqpfa0 ) then ? 
  i think not , i just looked at his history :  the fact that black people have a terminal lack of intelligence . 
  or  part of your wife 's job is to provide you with sex . 
  if she is breaking her part of the deal , you 're well within your rights to break your part of the deal .
