  not going to link it in case it breaks the rules . 
  wow , what the heck ? 
  definitely one of the worst things i 've read here . 
  that person worked his ass off and you respond like that ? 
  / u/anal _ yzer screw that guy . 
  i would have been more than glad to have had a hard working person like you coming to the netherlands . 
  man , this stuff is freaking me out . 
  i get that , and everyone is free to comment on whatever they want of course . 
  there is nothing wrong with commenting on foreign matters per se , but what is wrong is racism . 
  what is even more peculiar is that it is towards something of little significance and relevance to slovaks . 
  to put aside whether she won in a fair way , and as someone who is african-american/european , these things are always upsetting to read , but i assume this is unfortunately the ( slovak ) loud minority once again speaking . 
  feel sorry for the girl , she did n't make that decision , but has to bear all the hate from those idiots . 
  second of all , it 's ab-so-lute-ly ridiculous that some ( ! ), 
  slovaks have the time to worry about a beauty contest in another country . 
  last i checked bratislava was the capital , not helsinki . 
  i assume these are the same people that vote for that [ idiot named kotleba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marian_kotleba ) . 
  that 's quite a change , looks nice !, 
  reminds me of the netherlands . 
   the two loans came in 2014 from the first czech russian bank ( fcrb ) , a small private lender in moscow . 
   ...  they saved le pen 's party , which is in perpetual dire straits . 
  in 2013 , the last year for which official data are available , the party spent 10 million euros ( $ 10.5 million ) , of which only 2.8 million euros came from private donations . 
  even with 5.5 million in government support , the national front spent 650,000 euros more than it raised . 
  great , so this party is , or was rather , on russian life support ? 
  why are they backing out on le pen though ? 
  are they banking on fillon winning ? 
   the central bank of russia revoked the license of the national front 's moscow-based lender first czech russian bank ooo in july and the party has still to find another backer , according to treasurer wallerand de saint just . 
  saint just said he 's seeking international financiers in countries including russia because french banks have refused to fund his party . 
   ...  while russia sees the conservative candidate francois fillon as a strong presidential contender , it also does n't rule out a far-right victory , he said .

  perhaps i am wrong , but i have the idea that you and our mutual big neighbor place a lot more importance on privacy than us . 
  are you 12 ? 
  despite the likelihood of negative comments . 
  i for one am glad that she seems to be happy and proud to represent finland or helsinki rather . 
  i think karoliina ala-kantti is great too . 
   it accounts for a shrinking minority of our trade . 
  the rest of the world is far more important . 
  honest question , perhaps you can help me understand your point of view , but how will it not have a significant impact if around 50 % of your exports and 60 % of your imports were from the single market in 2014 ? 
  country | export to ( country ) | import from ( country ) -- | -- | -- austria | 0,58 % | 0,79 % belgium-luxembourg | 4,7 % | 5,30 % bulgaria | 0,12 % | 0,098 % croatia | 0,062 % | 0,027 % cyprus | - | - czech republic | 0,70 % | 1,20 % denmark | 0,99 % | 1,20 % estonia | 0,13 % | 0,057 % finland | 0,49 % | 0,59 % france | 5,7 % | 6,3 % germany | 9,8 % | 15 % greece | 0,34 % | 0,19 % hungary | 0,35 % | 0,62 % iceland | 0,076 % | 0,089 % ireland | 5,1 % | 2,9 % italy | 2,8 % | 4,2 % latvia | 0,065 % | 0,11 % lithuania | 0,29 % | 0,24 % malta | 0,11 % | 0,033 % netherlands | 7,2 % | 7,6 % norway | 1,2 % | 4,2 % poland | 1,2 % | 2,0 % portugal | 0,51 % | 0,58 % romania | 0,36 % | 0,39 % slovakia | 0,22 % | 0,58 % slovenia | 0,097 % | 0,088 % spain | 3,1 % | 3,3 % sweden | 2,0 % | 1,8 % switzerland | 7,1 % | 1,6 % ** eu28 + iceland , norway and switzerland ** | 55.39 % | 61 % via http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/, 
  perhaps i am not in on the joke , but you are not going to get a beating for being `` pro-eu '' here . 
  the user seems to have deleted his/her account . 
   outside the major cities , you will get death threats , even a physical beating if you say something pro-eu . 
  it 's over . 
  i have _ never _ heard of this . 
  which places are you talking about ? 
  thank you !, 
  just googled it and found this :  beur ( or alternatively , rebeu ) is a colloquial term to designate european-born people whose parents or grandparents are immigrants from north africa . 
  the equivalent term for a female beur is a beurette . 
  via [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beur ), 
  what does `` beurette '' mean ? 
  haha , it actually is the residence of the king of morocco . 
  seriously u.k. , you guys look for _ british chav _ porn ? 
   under the guidance of the reich , europe would speedily have become unified . 
  once the jewish poison had been eradicated , unification would have been an easy matter . 
  well , mr. hitler , then you have n't met nigel farage !,

  thank you for the effort !, 
  that 's cool . 
  i do n't see what all the fuss is about . 
  when i look at any catalog the only question i ask myself is if it will fit . 
  if you do n't mind , what does it mean ? 
  all i got was `` 120 kg ... pneumatiku ... model ... gothaj ... planetu '' , which seems ... weird !, 
  the stormtroopers in the latest star wars were conscripts unlike in the prequels ? 
   since when are ` men ' models ?

  glad they 're banned for life from chelsea 's stadium , although those bans do not really seem to work all that well here . 
  of course they all end up saying `` it was n't _ me _ who was racist ! '', 
  due to the consequences of such behavior . 
   no , mcdonald 's should not be there , because it is unsightly . 
  i doubt they 'll put a gigantic golden arch up outside . 
  i do n't know what the interior looks like , but here they look okay for a fast food restaurant : * [ example 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wrcbttj.jpg ) * [ example 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4ngfec9.jpg )  the stink of cooked oil can be smelled from many blocks away i have never experienced that here . 
  so your argument is `` i do n't like mcdonald 's and the tourists that visit are lazy and unwanted , so it should not be there . 
  '' , am i right ?

  yeah , now imagine a radical muslim doing this to a guy that spat on his shoes . 
  people would rightfully go nuts , yet some are defending [ a damn neo-nazi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fjwe31s_0g ) . 
  / u/parampcea why not post what you sent to me privately ? 
   are better than muslims and africans . 
  i would rather live next to neo nazys than next to muslims and africans . 
  i just remembered [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zakefosknq ) someone posted here a while ago . 
  happy holidays people . 
   secondly , other countries are also in the running as possible sites , including neighboring spain , france , the netherlands , and some eastern european countries was about to mention that . 
  we already have [ an assembly line in tilburg ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2015-10-13/check-out-tesla-s-hot-new-european-factory ) , but frankly i 'd rather see it go to another european country that might need it more . 
  boa sorte portugal !, 
  that 's right , we 're meant to be together \u2764, 
   i have read a lot about netherlands , where almost 50 % of people want to leave eu . 
  where did you read this ? 
  in general most people understand that the european union is beneficial for a country like ours that relies so much on trade . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what your definition of progress is here , so please expand on that . 
  the effects of apartheid still linger on of course , even though , de jure , it has ended . 
  surely as someone from poland you must understand that such history has lasting effects and a transformation of society takes a lot of time , could even span generations ? 
   there 's for a reason white countries are nice to live in and black countries are not . 
  most countries that are nice to live in nowadays are that way because they have a history of inequality that was overcome , often by the same people that were not seen as equals . 
  be it women , blacks , gays or any other group . 
  i doubt this `` reason '' can solely be attributed to people that fall into your category of white .
