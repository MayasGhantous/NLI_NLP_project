  i thought that was the case too , this is such a shame ... rest easy michael . 
  as a black person -- who would gladly welcome any pole to my country ( the netherlands ) -- it 's sad to see some people think of you in such ways , just because your skin holds a little bit more pigment . 
  no , not what i am implying . 
  i am implying that this is of no help . 
  for example , i am all for cutting foreign funding of radical islam being preached in be it bosnia , kosovo , germany , the netherlands or wherever in europe , but this way of `` helping '' seems counterproductive . 
  to me it looks like ammo for radicals on how europe hates muslims . 
  thanks , but no thanks . 
  looking at polish standards , the majority of them want hell on earth for women who opt to abort their pregnancy . 
  the majority of the netherlands will likely say no to any religious extremism . 
  whether it comes from islam or christianity . 
  stop the islamization of europe ? 
  how many muslims even live in poland ? 
  do these people get all their news from de telegraaf , bild , the sun , daily mail and many others i forgot to add ? 
  that 's the christmas spirit !, 
  not into football at all , but you seem to have cool football fans !, 
  that 's quite arrogant to say . 
  perhaps some truly do not believe or share your point of view . 
  some of these parties that promise massive change in 3-4 years are turning into political tell sell advertisements that of course ultimately prove out to be junk . 
  my bet is on pis not being an exception to that rule . 
  how do people in poland view pis now ? 
  did the balance tip or is there still massive support ?

  seriously , to blame everything on `` western europe '' is a load of baloney . 
  there is more to the greek debt crisis than just `` western europe does n't want to pay for it . '', 
  the actual money that went into poland via the european union exceeds that of the marshall plan by a lot , for example . 
  let me make something clear , i have _ zero _ difficulty with eu money being invested into critical infrastructure such as highways in poland or romania . 
  and to see the increase in trade over the years is great :  economic relations : since 2004 poland 's accession to the eu trade between the netherlands and poland more than tripled .

  last i heard , half of serbia wanted to join the european union , while a quarter was undecided and the remaining quarter did not want to join . 
  what i actually fear most is a united kingdom 2.0 that will block further cooperation . 
  leaving the rest of the european union in limbo forever . 
  the argument -- of russian origin i presume -- is indeed very old and tiring , he should be worried more about [ parties like this one ] ( https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.ft.com/content/106fdaf2-e46e-11e5-ac45-5c039e797d1c ) if he truly worries about nazis . 
   in one of the biggest surprises of saturday 's election , more than 200,000 slovakians cast ballots for the neo-nazi people 's party our slovakia ( l\u2019sns ) -- including 23 per cent of first-time voters . 
   ...  stocky and skin-headed -- and with a penchant for dressing up in uniforms modelled on slovakia 's wartime nazi-supporting militia -- mr kotleba borrows rhetoric and symbols from the country 's fascist past , has flirted with holocaust denial and called for muslims to be banned from the country . 
  it indeed is , i love this angry swiss guy . 
   that means that he has an army of hundreds of thousands literally ready to die for him 78.660 voted akp . 
  68 % of 240.000 dutch-turkish eligible voters did not even vote or voted for hdp , chp and so on . 
  how do you `` get '' that i am sweet talking a party i find abhorrent ? 
  just because i dislike them does n't mean i get a free pass on misrepresenting things . 
  if 69 % -- of the 114.000 dutch-turks that went out to vote -- voted for akp , it ends up being ** 78.660 ** of the ** 500.000 ** turks you mentioned or 78.660 of the 240.000 ^ 1 eligible to vote . 
  that paints quite a different picture . 
  do n't you agree ? 
  nowhere did i mention anything resembling `` sweet talking '' , in fact , i mentioned their controversial way of campaigning , which involved [ sending out letters asking people to vote akp and busing people to polling stations in order to get more votes ] ( https://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.zamanvandaag.nl%2fnieuws%2fbinnenland-turkije%2f9756%2fhonderden-bussen-diyanet-moskee%25c3%25abn-nederland-brengen-akp-stemmers-naar&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) . 
  we could also use the 270.000 [ metro ] ( http://www.metronieuws.nl/nieuws/binnenland/2016/04/nergens-zoveel-steun-voor-erdogan-als-in-nederland ) for some reason mentions unlike the 240.000 mentioned by [ het parool ] ( http://www.parool.nl/buitenland/hoge-opkomst-turkse-nederlanders-bij-verkiezingen-turkije~a4171275/ ) and [ nos ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2064218-turkse-nederlanders-naar-de-stembus.html ) , but that would bring down the voter turnout to 42 % , as 114.000 / 270.000 = 0.42, 
  yes , seemed i got the 64 % from the failed election before , support increased in the next one , perhaps due to the controversial way akp campaigned here . 
  the article you linked also states :  even though a majority of dutch-turks voted for erdogan , it of course does not mean there will not be any opponents . 
  `` the turkish diaspora in the netherlands is just as polarized as in turkey . '', 
  vermeulen stresses . 
  `` half of dutch-turks did not feel the need to cast a vote in these elections in a different country . 
  but those that did , mostly voted based on their emotion . 
  conservative and nationalist . '' some nuance is needed if you say that 69 % of 500.000 voted akp when that number is a lot lower . 
  114.000 * 0.69 / 270.000 still comes down to 30 % of eligible voters or 78.660 of them went out to vote for akp . 
  sizable and worrying ? 
  yes , but not as dramatic as `` 69 % out of 500.000 '' . 
  about 64 % of the 110.000 that went to vote and 240.000 dutch-turks that were eligible to vote voted akp or 72.000 in total out of 400.000-500 .000 dutch-turkish citizens if i am correct . 
  have to admit [ i did n't think about voter turnout ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ifd3z/netherlands_says_it_wary_of_long_arm_of_turkish/db7z23i/ ) until / u/macrosolid pointed out it was n't that high in austria . 
  still , compared to the other parties it 's quite worrying . 
  yes , i think so , if ` voter turnout * votes for party / eligible voters ` is true then 110.000 * 0.6426 / 240.000 = 0.29 . 
  if we look at the second biggest party that was voted for here , chp , 11.61 % of voters voted for them or 110.000 * 0.1161 / 240.000 = 0.05 of eligible voters . 
  correct me if i am wrong . 
  you 're right , those that went out to vote . 
  quite a lot of them did apparently ( [ 110.000 out of 240.000 eligible ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2015/10/over-110000-dutch-turks-vote-in-turkish-general-election/ ) ) .

  ) , more than in the united kingdom , listening might be a smart thing to do . 
  to add to that , turks in the netherlands are [ the biggest supporters of erdogan 's akp in europe ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2040192-erdogan-nergens-zo-populair-als-in-nederland.html ) with around 64 % of dutch turks voting akp . 
  yes , it reminds me of this part from the supposed draft reuters recently reported about , it seems to want more assurances concerning corruption :  the draft also says that fighting corruption in ukraine is key to fostering closer ties between kiev and the bloc . 
  via [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-eu-dutch-iduskbn14119u ) ( exclusive : dutch to demand limits on ukraine deal at eu summit ), 
   to be fair , is n't that what the dutch people voted against ? 
  i sampled a bunch of redditor nee-voters at the time , those were the common issues raised about the agreement . 
  yep . 
  it was an advisory referendum anyway , not a binding one . 
  i think putting in these reassurances is more than enough , as those indeed were the most common complaints , even though it was obvious from the get-go , for some at least .

  which means that many are worried that the corruption will result in our money being lost due to corruption . 
  that is _ exactly _ my point . 
  if ukraine somehow were to _ meet _ the criteria in 20-30 years , then why not ? 
  it is also why i said :  yet some can write off ukraine from ** ever ** entering as / u/ivanow said :  making any such plans so far into future , based on current situation is silly , at most . 
  i assume so , but if turkey enters the european union in its current state all hell would break loose . 
  anecdotal , but in my experience there is no support _ at all _ among the population and politicians -- i think we 'd even have trouble finding support among those that love the european union the very most . 
  the paranoid focus on turkey baffles me . 
  especially when countries such as serbia , macedonia , montenegro and albania are rarely , if ever , mentioned -- and they are much more likely to enter the european union in the near future than turkey . 
  to me it appears as an idea/fear that is not rooted in reality .
