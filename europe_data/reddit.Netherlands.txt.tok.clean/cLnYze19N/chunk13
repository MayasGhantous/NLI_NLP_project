  i think this applies to ukraine too . 
  feel free to convince me of this not being the case . 
  completely agree . 
  it 's what boggled my mind during brexit when some mentioned , in order to scare voters , that turkey would join . 
  and that when turkey has not even closed many of its chapters . 
  come on , everyone , i hope , knows that nearly everyone in germany , the netherlands , sweden and many more countries would veto that immediately due to the current situation . 
  i really do n't know . 
  i doubt that some of those that voted `` no '' would mind norway entering the european union , yet some can write off ukraine from _ ever _ entering . 
  it 's odd , if they meet the criteria , work hard on battling corruption and many more things , even if that is in 30 years , then why not ? 
   western europe does n't care about ukraine some of us do care . 
  yeah , that is exactly what i meant or at least tried to say . 
  what makes me roll my eyes is when people make it sound as if it is akin to murder or that it gives babies ptsd . 
  this is what i mean , there 's no normal discussion with people like you . 
  i did n't choose for that to be done and thus i explain why i will not enforce such a choice upon my children , if i were to have any . 
  instead , you talk to people like a 12 year old , by cursing . 
  do you understand that by calling someone a `` moron '' , whatever his/her view you immediately end a discussion or end up antagonizing the other person and making him/her unwilling to listen to you ? 
  now we wait !, 
  my dad 's american , so i got the same treatment . 
  i really do think people exaggerate when words such as `` mutilation '' and `` barbaric '' are used . 
  it 's akin to calling people with earrings `` mutilated '' to me . 
  however , i am of the opinion that this should be decided by the child when he is old enough and wants to do so . 
  the funny thing is that none of my closest friends are uncircumcised as they have american/jewish roots or are muslim . 
  haha , the excitement in your comment . 
  i ordered some things too , this is cool !, 
  mostly christian , most blacks here are either surinamese or from the antilles , here is [ some official data ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=37325&amp;d1=0&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=0-2,5,152,220&amp;d6=l&amp;hdr=g2,g3&amp;stb=g1,g5,t,g4&amp;charttype=0&amp;vw=t ) on the biggest black minorities we have in our country , unless i am forgetting some : background | total -- | -- total population | 16.979.120 autochtoon ^ 1 | 13.226.829 allochtoon ^ 2 | 3.752.291 ( former ) dutch antilles and aruba | 150.981 surinam | 349.022 1 . 
  person of whom both parents were born in the netherlands . 
  person of whom at least one parent was born abroad . 
  regarding surinam , on p. 37 in [ this document ] ( http://www.statistics-suriname.org/index.php/statistieken/downloads/category/30-censusstatistieken-2012?download=111:presentatie-definitieve-resultaten-census-8-vol-2 ) religion in surinam ( 2012 ) is highlighted : religion | population 2004 | population 2012 | growth ( total ) | growth ( % ) -- | -- | -- | -- | -- christianity | 200.744 | 262.320 | 61.576 | 30,7 % hinduism | 98.240 | 120.623 | 22.383 | 22,8 % islam | 66.307 | 75.053 | 8.746 | 13,2 % other + none | 50.334 | 66.560 | 16.226 | 32,2 % unknown | 77.204 | 17.082 | -60.122 | -77,9 % total | 492.829 | 541.638 | 48.809 | 9,9 % wikipedia lists most of the former dutch antilles being catholic ( 72 % ) , which basically confirms what i thought would be the case . 
   the murder of that girl was the direct cause of merkel 's open door policy . 
  how is that direct , that is indirect ? 
  the direct cause was the migrant deciding to rape and murder her . 
  haha , yes , `` consolation prize for not having a mountain . '', 
   oh , you think the darkness is your ally ? 
  you merely adopted the dark !, 
  austria was born in it , molded by it . 
  frankly , that sounds way too dark in this context . 
  indeed , many of these problems that put people in prison still fester on . 
  the fact that blacks are [ 3.73 more likely ] ( https://www.aclu.org/report/report-war-marijuana-black-and-white?redirect=report/war-marijuana-black-and-white ) to be arrested for marijuana usage being another one . 
  if we take a look at the statistics for _ violent crime _ arrests on [ fbi.gov ] ( https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43 ) from 2015 , which include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter , rape , robbery , and aggravated assault , we see the following for whites and blacks : offense charged | white ( total ) | black ( total ) | white ( % ) | black ( % ) -- | -- | -- | -- | -- murder and nonnegligent manslaughter | 3.908 | 4.347 | 45,9 % | 51,1 % rape | 11.809 | 4.907 | 68,0 % | 28,2 % robbery | 32.439 | 39.052 | 44,4 % | 53,5 % aggravated assault | 184.024 | 92.237 | 64,0 % | 32,1 % violent crime | 232.180 | 140.543 | 60,1 % | 36,4 % the 36,4 % listed is lower than `` over 50 % of violent crime '' by quite a margin for the black population in the united states which stands around [ 12.6 % ] ( https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/rhi225215/00 ) . 
  still , that 's a lot , but i 'm not sure what else to expect ? 
  poverty is associated with crime and poor people are obviously overrepresented in these statistics . 
  we could look at the origins of gang violence in black communities and how such gangs came to be if you are interested in the high murder rate ? 
  everything can be explained , and do n't get me wrong , that does n't make it excusable . 
  i think it 's a good thing that you at least seem to have a genuine interest in these issues unlike others in this thread . 
  just let him believe his thing , there 's no convincing . 
  the fact that many blacks in the united states were not allowed to enjoy the same level of education , were not allowed to live in the same areas as whites lived in , and even , as of today , receive much harsher sentences ( e.g. 
  the [ 100-1 sentencing disparity between crack and powdered cocaine ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/us/obama-commuting-sentences-in-crack-cocaine-cases.html ) ) and _ just _ these variables do not enter his/her mind . 
  it 's just easier to blame it all on demographic _ x _ or _ y _ instead and wash one 's hands in innocence . 
  / u/wislahd never said anything about canada 's treatment of the native population . 
  let 's stick to the matter at hand . 
   in europe most blacks are muslim . 
  what ? 
  not the case at all in the netherlands . 
   in a series of posts on youtube , sellner suggests white christians are on the verge of `` extinction , '' has nothing to do with islam whatsoever , which they are so opposed to . 
  you 'd find those numbers dwindling just as much without them in the netherlands at least . 
  [ these doomsday videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjbmv1p_4bc ) are n't helping their cause either , but i guess it appeals to those who do share those thoughts . 
   the image of the mother of jesus has been standing on the shores of lake geneva since 2011 . 
  it has been the subject of local controversy for some years after it was paid for with municipal funds . 
  was surprised by the title until i read that . 
  not even a real piece of history . 
  i 'd be pissed off as well if taxes would go towards financing someone 's favorite religion . 
   germany does n't allow non-eu/eu dual-citizenship . 
  really ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  so , many people in germany , let 's say those of turkish descent , do not hold a turkish and german passport , but only the german one ? 
  i honestly do n't know , but every time i see a french person speak out about this here , they say their elections absolutely ca n't be compared to trump or brexit and how it 's unlikely that she 'll win . 
  i think you replied to the wrong person !, 
  i just thought the wording was funny in the post i replied to . 
  i agree with most of what you said , but i did not intend for it to be all-encompassing . 
  i thought they were just interesting to look at -- worrying perhaps is a better word !, 
  there are indeed many variables at play here that i did not include , _ outsourcing _ to china of course being one of them . 
  these really hit home to me : * [ electric power consumption ( kwh per capita ) ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/eg.use.elec.kh.pc?locations=cn-us-eu-in ) * [ fossil fuel energy consumption ( % of total ) ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/eg.use.comm.fo.zs?locations=cn-us-eu-in ) * [ co2 emissions ( kt ) ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/en.atm.co2e.kt?locations=cn-us-eu-in ) * [ alternative and nuclear energy ( % of total energy use ) ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/eg.use.comm.cl.zs?locations=cn-us-eu-in ) although the last one is nice to see . 
  i think you 'd want to not weed out the genuine refugees . 
  just thought it looked funny . 
  funny , you just called him arrogant and other things for having an opinion which added quite a lot of nuance . 
  reminds me of [ some of the responses ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2014/11/58390/ ) our football team got . 
  frankly , i do have to add that there was mass disapproval , so that was good , but some really do have a negative opinion towards people that look different , no matter if they are perfectly integrated . 
  same here , not a supporter of capital punishment . 
  that one can do this to a child and the realization that this is likely one of many cases saddens me beyond belief . 
  some people , even doctors , can be dicks , sometimes not even intentionally . 
  this might be one of those cases . 
  in general i think there 's nothing wrong with our doctors . 
  the economy , immigration and terrorism [ were the major reasons ] ( http://www.people-press.org/2016/11/10/a-divided-and-pessimistic-electorate/ ) as to why people voted for donald trump . 
  i think he just gave an example . 
  it reminds me of some anti-vaccination mothers that were recently invited to a dutch talkshow . 
  once people throw facts out of the window , just so they can stick to their narrative , it is hard to convince them that they might be wrong on certain aspects . 
  trying to convince these people as an _ outsider _ seems to only strengthen their beliefs in my experience . 
  it also is even more difficult when they have descended into the abyss of _ wordpress journalism _ . 
   obama and saudi arabia created isis . 
  how so ? 
  from what i understood the _ environment _ for isis to thrive in was created partially by paul bremer 's call to disband the iraqi army during the bush era . 
   isis is an ally in syria but a foe on western soil . 
  explain ? 
  i know that other less `` moderate '' groups are seen as allies , but isis ? 
  perhaps they are edible balaclavas made out of turkish baklava ? 
  well , putin [ admitted ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-appc4xov4 ) to the `` green men '' being russian . 
  this should not be controversial at all . 
  what could be the result of this besides it being recognized ? 
  i have ab-so-lute-ly no idea what just happened . 
  confused ...
