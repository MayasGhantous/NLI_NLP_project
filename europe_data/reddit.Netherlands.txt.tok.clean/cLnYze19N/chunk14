   look at hitlers house in austria or that castle in belgium that castle in belgium is not structurally sound and should be demolished as the cost to repair it is simply way too high for a castle that is not even that old . 
   we need a movement like r/the _ donald that fights against establishment ideas , but without the extremism , racism , xenophobia etc. 
  i am pitching europe demands !, 
  even though our own wouter bos thought of him as a populist when he was recently invited to pauw on television . 
   they do n't need to be given close to $ 2000 in benefits each month . 
  where are you getting this from ? 
   trump 's vetting program can you please explain all the intricacies of this program , beyond it simply banning people based on their religion ? 
  despite the message being concerning , is n't this quite an insignificant fringe party when quickly looking at how its polling ? 
   how would i know if it mattered to me without knowing the person ? 
  i think many would appreciate your view on people , but is n't that the point of this survey on discrimination in the eu ? 
  how they would feel about it , without knowing the person . 
  same in the dutch one . 
  `` liefdesrelatie '' was used , which would be `` love relationship '' literally . 
   1 - i do n't want my child to fuck foreigners  10 - i really want my child to fuck foreigners , because it makes my balls tingle with pleasure  ( of course i am overexaggerating , but you get the idea ) haha , that 's unfortunate , but hilarious . 
  someone should at least inform them as they were published every three years ( 2009 , 2012 and 2015 ) around may/june . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's the wrong document . 
  the fact sheet only contains _ qc13 _ , which talks about one 's collegaues , but the actual question is _ qc14 _ , which can be found [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6tg8s9/the_highly_upvoted_eurobarometer_survey_that/dlkmsin/ ) thanks to / u/randomstranger454 . 
  awesome , thank you random stranger !, 
  translation is fine for the dutch one . 
  is it just me or is ** qc14 ** not even in those documents ? 
  where can i find it / u/thrfre ? 
   ** qc14 : ** regardless of whether you have children or not , please tell me , using a scale from 1 to 10 , how comfortable you would feel if one of your children was in a love relationship with a person from each of the following groups . 
  the [ fact sheet for the netherlands ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/resultdoc/download/documentky/68115 ) has qc 1 , ** ~ ~ 2 ~ ~ ** , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , ** ~ ~ 7 ~ ~ ** , 8 , 9 , 10 , ** ~ ~ 11 ~ ~ ** , ** ~ ~ 12 ~ ~ ** , 13 , ** ~ ~ 14 ~ ~ ** , 16 , and 17 . 
  so five are missing ? 
  i must be looking at the wrong document . 
  i was mostly curious as to whether it was recursive and would grab the image from the post i replied to . 
  needs more jpeg . 
  i agree , i thought the numbers would be interesting , as the rate at which they are being added surprised me actually !, 
  i think we will be alright by the time affordable electric cars for most will be out . 
  well , 1/10 -- or even more -- vote golden dawn , no ? 
  so it did n't surprise me unfortunately . 
  i never understood why people are attracted to such a party in the first place . 
  perhaps it is due to the economic hardship , but i think you as a greek person would be better at explaining why . 
  i was interested in the charging points in the netherlands , so i tried to look it up . 
  * [ charging points ( public , semi-public and quick charge ) in the netherlands ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mtzkn05.png ) the last value only is halfway there of course as it is from mid 2017 and it also excludes private charging points . 
  wow , any company agreeing to these terms would lose all credibility in most of europe . 
  i am surprised shoe size is n't on that list . 
  i ca n't see any service worth using agreeing to these terms . 
  do you think any will agree to this ? 
   that 's why the eu should aim to end abortion in all of its member states . 
  pretty much why i am against any federalization . 
  we left the '60s quite some time ago . 
  just because you can do so at 22 weeks does n't mean that it happens . 
  in fact , in the netherlands , ** the majority aborts at 6 weeks and nearly 90 % at < 12 weeks ** ( rutgers , p. 5 -- 6 , fig . 
  * [ rutgers , `` landelijke abortusregistratie ( 2014 ) '' ] ( https://www.rutgers.nl/sites/rutgersnl/files/pdf/lar_rapportage_2014_def.pdf ), 
  the united states has a lot of teenage mothers though . 
  those statistics are bunk , not relevant and should be discarded in the context of europe as a whole , or poland to be more specific . 
  consider the following : country | birth rate per 1000 women ; age 15-19 -- | -- netherlands | 5.3 poland | 16.2 russia | 30.2 united states | 41.5 * [ united nations , live births by age of mother ] ( https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2009-2010/table10.pdf ) also , ** nearly 70 % ** of those that got an abortion in the netherlands ** used contraceptives ** ( rutgers , p. 5 , fig . 
  * [ rutgers , `` landelijke abortusregistratie ( 2014 ) '' ] ( https://www.rutgers.nl/sites/rutgersnl/files/pdf/lar_rapportage_2014_def.pdf ) i 'm not sure how much of that applies to poland , but it 's not fair to pretend abstinence will work , as someone in this thread is doing . 
  it does n't . 
  its preached in some places in the united states and you will just end up with an increased teenage pregnancy rate -- and in most cases a higher abortion rate as well , as the statistics from the u.n. show . 
  no , and having an abortion is n't an easy decision for most . 
  * [ as / u/logiman43 mentioned ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6t0zy3/poland_pis_party_started_to_lay_off_md_with/dlh13iu/ ) , nobody 's forced to carry a dead fetus here :  `` the fact that my wife and i were simply forced to wait for months for the stillbirth of a dead fetus was inhumane and heartless , '' complains viktor * if it 's banned , people are going to get abortions abroad . 
  they 'll be fine in czechia i presume . 
  or worse , they might come up with their own ways of doing it . 
  if you 're interested , you can have an abortion here up to 22 weeks . 
  up to age 16 you generally need to have permission from your parents and between age 16 -- 18 you will need permission from your parents if it has been determined you are not able to make that decision . 
  after 18 you can decide on your own . 
  '' ] ( https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/abortus/vraag-en-antwoord/abortus-toestemming ) in my opinion , 22 weeks is too much , but i do think the right to abortion is important . 
  after 22 weeks supposedly one can only abort the pregnancy due to the child 's health being a very serious concern . 
  what do you think will happen to those who want an abortion but ca n't get one ? 
  hahaha , that reminds me of [ this video with our police ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pbwwuzqmy ) . 
  40kg of cheese in the car , 40kg of cheese , take one down , pass it around, 
  what am i supposed to see here ? 
  that article , as they explain , only exists due to our transparency . 
   because of the dutch system 's commitment to transparency , summaries of most cases of psychiatric eas are available online  ...  ** dutch euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide due care criteria7 ( p12 ) **  the committees examine retrospectively whether the attending physician acted in accordance with the statutory due care criteria laid down in section 2 of [ the termination of life on request and assisted suicide ( review procedures ) act ] . 
  these criteria determine that physicians must :   ** a. 
  ** be satisfied that the patient 's request is voluntary and well-considered ; ** b. 
  ** be satisfied that the patient 's suffering is unbearable , with no prospect of improvement ; ** c. ** have informed the patient about his situation and his prognosis ; ** d. ** have come to the conclusion , together with the patient , that there is no reasonable alternative in the patient 's situation ; ** e. ** have consulted at least one other , independent physician , who must see the patient and give a written opinion on whether the due care criteria set out in ( a ) to ( d ) have been fulfilled ; ** f. ** exercise due medical care and attention in terminating the patient 's life or assisting in his suicide . 
  also , there 's this :  among all 110 psychiatric eas cases reported to the rte , the rte found that the due care criteria were not met in only one patient ( 1 % ) , a woman ( case 2014-01 ) in her 80s with chronic depression who sought help from the end-of-life clinic . 
  the clinic physician met with her 2 times ( the first time was 3 weeks before her death ) , and the patient was not alone on both occasions , with family members present . 
  the physician was not a psychiatrist , did not consult psychiatrists , was unaware of the dutch psychiatric association guidelines ,21 and yet `` had not a single doubt '' about the patient 's prognosis . 
  the consultant in the case , a scen general practitioner , agreed with the physician that all due care criteria were met . 
   in the netherlands , dutch companies are advising female employees not to wear mini-skirts or other `` suggestive '' clothing . 
  sounds like shakira law to me .

  who told you that ? 
  ah , alright !, 
  my bad . 
  yeah , in my opinion it is the same as someone raising a point about e.g. 
  terrorism and someone going `` worry about traffic deaths instead ! '', 
  it 's a `` nice '' way to tell someone apparently to shut up about a certain subject . 
  have a good night !, 
  i did -- for now . 
  other countries , whether in politics or the general attitude , are too different from ours in my opinion , so i do not want to see us lose influence or our way of life . 
  the benelux would merge before the entire european union , and even that is something i do n't see happening anytime soon . 
  you are referring to gang violence , which is indeed a big problem , but not every black person is in a gang . 
  can you really blame the entire group of people for not wanting law enforcement to resemble another gang ?

  in the episode they asked one of the other bar owners -- which supposedly was a safe place -- about it and he wondered why the police did n't do much about those bars .
