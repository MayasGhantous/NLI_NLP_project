  they mentioned there are bars controlled by russian gangsters or something from looking at the footage , it was at `` ka\u013c\u0137u iela 24 '' , i believe . 
  otherwise , not so much unfortunately . 
  it 's already far more expensive in croatia when compared to the netherlands from what i was told . 
  lol .

  haha , i was expecting something completely else . 
  this actually is a great statue !, 
  if i recall correctly , it leaves them without a potential warm water port for naval operations in the mediterranean , as all countries around the adriatic are tied to nato . 
  hmmm , interesting fellow . 
  is that a joke ? 
  what is italy 's relationship with this officer ? 
  i 'm reading the german one right now , but i think an english one , or at least a list of key points , would help facilitate discussion . 
  freedom of labor ca n't be a one-way street , although in practice , that is sort of what is happening due to economic differences , as many more from e. europe move towards w. europe . 
  it definitely ca n't be racist either , as that goes against the values of the european union and the many constitutions of its member states . 
  for example , the netherlands has many non-white minorities from former colonies -- more than a million in fact -- such as indonesia ( 400.000 ) , surinam ( 350.000 ) and the ( former ) dutch antilles and aruba ( 150.000 ) . 
  denying them the use of the same right that is granted to other countries , and which those countries extensively make use of , such as poland , is hypocritical to say the least , do n't you think ? 
  i fail to see the issue as to why someone 's skin color would be a problem . 
  can you expand on this ? 
   i wonder if the eu will realise on time how serious poles are regarding their opinion on non-white immigrants . 
  are you implying that non-white minorities from e.g. 
  the netherlands would not be allowed to migrate to poland due to their background ? 
  wanting equal rights , and to actually be seen as an equal , seems to be the `` right side '' to me ? 
   the right wanted to help . 
  the left , like western europe , could n't have cared less . 
  if w. europe truly did not care , we would remove the sanctions . 
  we will not , because most do care . 
  furthermore , the ruling party here has been center-right for ages . 
  haha , it was just some equipment i did n't see mentioned yet in the thread .

  trapping someone under the sheets after a fart can be referred to as a '' [ dutch oven ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dutch%20oven ) . '', 
  i think that 's what / u/oswald14 meant . 
   just dont buy dutch products . 
  overpriced and shit . 
  you truly hate europe , do n't you ? 
  what attracts you to / r/europe , considering some of your previous posts if i may ask ? 
   i hope not . 
  german is a language of degenerates . 
   ...  germany is the most powerful nation full of rotten corrupt assholes and the daemons come from the east  ...  europe is again plagued by the german and russian scum . 
   ...  europe retailers are bunch of cheapskates and assholes . 
  you can get much better quality in the us or asia . 
  not my fault , wish it indeed would be a bit more detailed . 
  was quite interested in those ages myself . 
  the title is accurate i think . 
  in 2015 ** 147.134 ** people died , of which ** 6.672 ** were the result of euthanasia . 
  that does come down to about ** 4.5 % ** . 
  the ages of those ** 6.672 ** cases : age group | amount | percentage -- | -- | -- all ages | 6.672 | 100 % 0 | 0 | 0 % 1 -- 17 | 0 | 0 % 17 -- 65 | 1.544 | 23.1 % 65 -- 80 | 2.764 | 41.4 % 80 and older | 2.365 | 35.4 % so ** ages 65 and up ** account for ** 3/4 ** of all cases of euthanasia . 
  gotland , as a moustache , makes it look like hitler to me . 
  benelux thicc, 
  indeed . 
  i try to avoid sounding like the `` let me tell you what 's what ! '', 
  type of person . 
  that 's exactly my point / u/fluchtpunkt !, 
  we 're on the same page here . 
  i explained that the need for working permits is a much bigger roadblock below , as countries can delay freedom of movement for up to seven years : * [ european commission , `` enlargement - transitional provisions '' ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=466&amp; ), 
  yeah , to my knowledge it does n't have much of an effect on the flow of intra-eu migration ? 
  in july 2018 croats can work in the netherlands for example without needing a permit to work ( tewerkstellingsvergunning ) . 
  that 's quite a roadblock for most unskilled labor . 
  while we 're at it , do n't forget the assassination of the first congolese democratically elected leader , [ patrice lumumba ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/patrice-lumumba-50th-anniversary-assassination ) . 
  `` freedom '' seemed to have only been valued when it aligned with their `` freedom '' at the time . 
  side note , but that 's not schengen though ? 
  romania and bulgaria are not in schengen for example -- not that i agree with that decision . 
  `` forget ukraine '' , what 's up with the inflammatory title ? 
  in case the telegraph is n't aware , more than 10.000 have died in the ukrainian conflict . 
  how many have died in this `` arctic showdown '' so far ? 
  also , i ca n't read this `` premium '' article . 
  this is really interesting !, 
  do you know where that hotspot in russia comes from ? 
   the step comes after jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's most powerful politician , said the `` polish government is preparing itself for a historical counteroffensive . '', 
  `` counteroffensive '' , really , is that what he said ? 
  this guy is such a drama queen . 
  i think he would get much further by discussing it in a respectful way . 
   are arabs who move to europe suddenly european ? 
  i never said that and neither does it have to do anything with the fact that russia and turkey are ** transcontinental countries ** , i.e. 
  both in europe and asia . 
  turkey has been a candidate since the eec . 
  the fact is that the eu decides on who can or can not join . 
  if you do n't like that decision , take it up with them . 
   ** iii . 
  conditions of accession **  a ) the european state  the sole material condition laid down by article o of the teu is that the applicant must be a ` european state ' . 
  there is no unequivocal interpretation of that criterion . 
  it can be read equally well in geographical , cultural or political terms . 
   in 1987 an application to become a member of the communities was received from morocco . 
  the application was rejected by the council on the grounds that morocco was not a european state ( 7 ) . 
  ** in the case of turkey , article 28 of the association agreement signed in 1963 includes the option of turkey 's eventually acceding to the communities . 
  turkey in fact lodged an application to accede on 14 april 1987 . 
  historically , turkey has formed part of the so-called ` european concert ' . 
  although part of turkey 's territory is located geographically in asia , parliament , the council and the commission have confirmed turkey 's eligibility ( 8 ) . 
  this example shows that the term ` european state ' need not be interpreted in a strictly geographical sense . 
  it is at all events a criterion subject to political assessment . 
  ** * [ european parliament , `` briefing no 23 , legal questions of enlargement '' ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/enlargement/briefings/23a2_en.htm ), 
   turkey can never join since it is not europe . 
  just like russia , turkey is a eurasian country , meaning they are both in europe and asia . 
  or are [ people from buryatia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxyaevuh94i ) suddenly european ? 
   if nazi germany could go from nazism to the coal and steel union then russia can go from whatever it is today to and eu member even faster . 
  you 're ignoring the influence the allies had on west-germany .
