   ** did n't france democratize a southern neighbour , libya , with eu backing ? 
  ** i do n't think you 'll find one country that deems it to be a flawless victory . 
  not sure what the point is . 
   ** if talking about their moves to induce divides within countries ... what else can russia do that would n't get nato , and thus the us , involved ? 
  it 's gon na be funny if the us ever pulls out of nato . 
  ** one could just stick to improving relations and trade , like we do in the european union and with countries outside of it such as norway and switzerland . 
  this hostile attitude of divide and conquer is what puts people off . 
   ** not really . 
  both the eu and russia are heavily into geopolitics they just happen to be rivals . 
  ** i guess that is what makes it a great candidate for membership !, 
   ** you are aware the doors are wide open to people living in a similar level of poverty already , right ? 
  ** they 're not open to as many people and most people in europe are better off . 
  for example , pickpocketing increased dramatically upon the accession of romania and bulgaria in 2007 : [ ** registrations and arrests of suspects for pickpocketing by nationality in the netherlands ** ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=82315ned&amp;d1=8&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0-1,9,26&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=6,8,10,12,14&amp;hdr=g4,g1,g3&amp;stb=t,g2&amp;vw=t ) nationality | 2005 | 2007 | 2009 | 2011 | 2013 -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- total | 1090 | 870 | 1260 | 1520 | 2050 dutch | 610 | 400 | 450 | 570 | 560 bulgarian | 30 | 70 | 160 | 150 | 300 romanian | 40 | 100 | 290 | 400 | 800 keep in mind that romania and bulgaria combined have a population of around ** 25 million ** . 
  it is manageable , but still , quite an increase in this type of crime . 
  now realize that russia has ** six times ** the population of romania and bulgaria combined . 
   ** flying over a conflict zone riddled with anti-air can do that . 
  ** and which [ man-portable air-defense system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/man-portable_air-defense_system ) can reach a plane at 10 km/33 .000 ft ? 
  an advanced buk system was supplied by russia and this missile hit mh17 . 
  you 're making it sound as if it 's normal to have a trained crew around that knows how to operate the buk system . 
  it 's not . 
  the flight level for planes was already raised before and was deemed to be safe . 
   ** considering russia veto 'd , quite a few , motions to go in militarily into syria ** i was speaking about decision made within the european union that would weaken it , favoring russia . 
   ** there are outstanding territorial issues , yes , but as a whole ... not more so than say what sort of disagreements exist between hungary and romania . 
  ** poland , finland and the baltics have the same relationship with russia as hungary does with romania ? 
  that 's new . 
   ** for some years , sure , but then russia would start paying back investments by increases in production , gdp , etc which would increase , many fold , the money available to those other members . 
  ** some other countries that have joined years ago are just now becoming net contributors . 
  russia would be a humongous drain on the budget for all those years . 
  i do n't fail to see that , i am stating why this is extremely unlikely to happen anytime soon , not that it can never happen , so it does matter i believe . 
  the idea some here have is `` could russia join ... if russia was n't russia ? '', 
  russia does n't just stop being russia when putin is gone . 
  if one wants to answer the question of the op , you would have to state what has to change in order for them to be even able to join . 
  i only listed a few -- but significant -- points . 
  it will take generations for the general attitude of russians towards the european union to change -- if they ever decided they would even want to head into that direction !, 
  sure , the world is full of wonders , but `` wishful thinking '' would be too generous in the case of russia joining the european union in the next decades . 
  furthermore , if they even were to join , they would have tremendous influence on which direction the european union should be heading in . 
  i would like to preserve our way of life and considering we are a tiny nation in comparison , we would lose influence . 
  therefore , just as with turkey , my answer still is `` no , not going to happen anytime soon . 
  '' , which we both seem to agree on . 
  i 'm on mobile , so my apologies for not being able to expand , but : * aggression towards neighboring countries * attempts at destabilizing most of europe * completely different foreign policy * lack of rights for homosexuals , [ we even provide asylum ] ( http://nltimes.nl/2015/09/08/dutch-open-doors-russian-lgbt-asylum-claims ) . 
  * mh17 * criminals tend to flock to where the money is at . 
  freedom of movement for 150 million would thus increase crime dramatically . 
  * they would veto so many things * i think the usual disagreements between w. europe and e. europe will pale in comparison to those between e. europe and russia . 
  * what about the eu budget ? 
  other members would end up getting crumbs due to russia 's size . 
  frankly , if one wanted to blow up the european union and see it explode , add russia or turkey to it . 
  there are so many reasons why i would be against this , but russia would be turkey on steroids , so no . 
  they have more than twice the population of turkey . 
  freedom of movement for 150 million people would be the shitshow of the century . 
  ah , i was trying to keep it short !, 
  explaining those terms would n't really add that much , and it overlapped quite nicely with _ migrationshintergrund _ , although they are still used as you say !, 
  our central bureau of statistics and scientific council for government policy decided to switch to `` migration background '' quite some time ago . 
  considering you are from brussels , here are some articles on it in dutch : * [ centraal bureau voor de statistiek , `` termen allochtoon en autochtoon herzien '' ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/corporate/2016/43/termen-allochtoon-en-autochtoon-herzien ) * [ wetenschappelijke raad voor het regeringsbeleid , `` de termen ` allochtoon en autochtoon ' hebben hun tijd gehad '' ] ( https://www.wrr.nl/actueel/nieuws/2016/11/01/de-termen-%e2%80%98allochtoon-en-autochtoon%e2%80%99-hebben-hun-tijd-gehad ), 
  haha , [ someone posted this video ] ( https://youtu.be/qpktvccn1s0?t=28 ) a while ago of edi rama rapping , that 's really cool . 
  it sounds like brazillian portuguese rap to me . 
  yeah , everybody 's rolling out the red carpet it seems . 
  it 'll be interesting , good luck indeed !, 
  good luck !, 
  :-) it 's funny to see every country wanting this thing so much . 
  [ we even have a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ntbzbiewvy ) for our own bid . 
  reminds me of a friend that once had drawn a crooked swastika on a friend 's forehead while he was asleep . 
  he walked around with that thing the next day without knowing it was on his head . 
  the only mass shooting i can think of in the netherlands : * [ alphen aan de rijn shopping mall shooting ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/alphen_aan_den_rijn_shopping_mall_shooting ), 
  i am not sure if that would work , as i am black . 
  you are asking me if i would support segregation . 
  no , i would not support that . 
  when i go to the gym , the only thing i ** really ** worry about is ** theft ** , not terror attacks as i am working out . 
  you do not understand what the word migrationshintergrund means . 
  yeah , we use _ migratieachtergrond _ here too . 
  when one of your parents was not born in the netherlands . 
  i would be in that category due to an american father . 
  i bet you 'd be the first to whine , if a business here said `` no hungarians allowed . '', 
  if a gym owner has reasonable suspicion something might be wrong , he/she can contact the police . 
  are we going to ban nationals that statistically steal more often too ? 
  i think you 're well aware which groups would then also be banned . 
  you 're arguing the german constitution should allow for segregation . 
  `` as of immediately , no fellow citizens with a ** migration background ** ( migrationshintergrund ) are allowed to join the gym in order to protect our members , '' so , that includes any non-german they do n't want in . 
  somehow i feel someone higher up probably approved of this tracking . 
  i ca n't imagine a dev _ wanting _ to add this . 
  o , i skipped those at first , but decided to read some of them after your comment . 
  excuse me ? 
  corporate managers ? 
  i am confused now !, 
  i think i recall once mistaking the flag for republika srpska with the russian one , but / u/aemilius _ paulus admits he is russian . 
  what is going on here ? 
  i 'm always reminded of [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/lqddnbxxn20?t=210 ) in the context of justification of invasion . 
  thanks for responding !, 
   barack obama is half white , half black but he identifies as a black man and we all accept it because he looks black and says he is black . 
  with obama , i recall quite some people accepting or rejecting him , such as morgan freeman , and mentioning he was n't _ really _ black , due to his mixed background . 
  even with the nationalities of historical figures in europe itself it somehow ends up being a tug-of-war , such as with nikola tesla and many others . 
   your question is essentially `` what is european enough '' ? 
  there is no real answer to that . 
   ...  you could take a sicilian with significant portions of moorish blood as an example ; i do n't have any issues with identifying them as europeans . 
  that 's why i think it 's an interesting question in the context of identity of those with foreign ancestry , being biracial myself . 
  i just thought it was odd have a nice day, 
  one could also interpret it as `` european [ citizen ] '' . 
  i do n't think anyone 's trying to claim he 's the descendant of william of orange . 
  alright , i did n't try to insinuate that . 
  i was mostly interested in where this threshold lies according to you -- 1/2 , 1/4 , 1/8 , 1/16 etc. 
  a lot of people do have traces of foreign ancestry .
