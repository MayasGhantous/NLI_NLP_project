  you are from the czech republic ? 
  far-left ? 
  which party would that be ? 
  it was a sincere question , due to you being so outspoken . 
  i wondered what you had to say about those who are neither fully _ x _ or _ y _ when it comes to their ethnicity . 
  geert wilders for example is not fully european , but would mentioning that he is not fully `` european '' be on your mind too then ? 
   it means that you look a certain way i.e. 
  white . 
  how does this work according to you for those who are biracial ? 
  i think quite a lot of people here think he 's a decent guy !, 
  he seems like a mayor that really loves his city , but i 'll leave that up to those from rotterdam . 
  the independent quoted the financial times multiple times , so here 's that one , also contains some extra interesting information in my opinion :  ** mufg eyes amsterdam as post-brexit eu base ** european capitals vie to snap up lost london business  mufg , japan 's biggest bank , plans to choose amsterdam as the new eu base for its investment banking operations to cope with the disruption of brexit , according to two people briefed on the situation . 
   the decision highlights the fierce competition between european capitals , which are vying to snap up london 's financial services companies in the wake of brexit . 
  mufg 's move also underlines how many of the world 's biggest banks have decided they can not afford to wait for political uncertainty surrounding the outcome of brexit negotiations to clear before implementing their plans for a potential clean break between the uk and eu . 
   faced with the likely loss of its passporting rights to sell investment banking services from london to the rest of europe , mufg is set to open a second arm of its european securities operation in amsterdam . 
   such a shift could involve hundreds of jobs moving to amsterdam out of the 2,100 people mufg employs in london . 
  but one person briefed on the plan said it would initially affect fewer than 100 jobs . 
  the japanese group would be the first global lender to pick the dutch city as its new eu hub to cope with the disruption of brexit . 
   it would mark a break with mufg 's main japanese rivals , including nomura , daiwa and sumitomo mitsui financial , which have all said they plan to make frankfurt the main base of their investment banks for eu clients . 
   the pace of announcements about banks ' brexit plans has picked up in recent weeks , partly due to pressure from the bank of england for them to submit their plans for coping with the `` worst-case scenario '' of a hard brexit , severing access to eu clients . 
   amsterdam has struggled to attract many of the big name financial institutions shifting operations out of london because of brexit . 
  citigroup , morgan stanley and standard chartered have chosen frankfurt , hsbc has opted for paris and bank of america and barclays have picked dublin . 
   one factor going against the dutch city is the country 's decision to impose a stricter cap on bonuses than required by eu law . 
  dutch banks are limited to paying bonuses of no more than 20 per cent of fixed pay , while other eu banks can pay bonuses of up to double their fixed pay with the consent of investors . 
   dutch ministers have promised that foreign banks moving operations to the netherlands could avoid the 20 per cent cap by using an exception in the law for groups which employ at least three-quarters of their staff outside the country . 
   amsterdam benefits from strong transport links , which will be improved when eurostar extends its high-speed train service to the dutch city next year . 
   mufg has already made amsterdam the main eu headquarters for its corporate and retail banking operations . 
   the japanese lender , which has about 700 staff spread across 22 offices in 14 european countries outside the uk , is still in discussions with its various regulators about its brexit plans and no decision has been made , according to a person briefed on the matter . 
   while amsterdam is the clear favourite , the bank has not completely closed off other potential locations , the person said . 
   mufg declined to comment .

  did czechia push slovakia off the chart ? 
  where did it go ? 
   `` we call upon the state of albania to get involved and stop the extradition to serbia . 
  ** we as a family are ready to do something very radical that would surprise everyone ** , '' said xavair without revealing details about their plans . 
  sounds like a wonderful family . 
  i do think his life might be in danger . 
  putting an albanian , that promoted a greater albania , between other , perhaps violent , serbian criminals , does n't like a great idea . 
  correct , my bad !, 
  i expanded on my comment in another reply !, 
  i just noticed the shitstorm that spawned , but i did n't mean to advocate for that . 
  i should have expanded on my comment . 
  what i meant to say was that `` it 's unfortunate that an amount might still be able to slip through the cracks . '', 
  it 's very hard to figure out which crimes have been committed by those abroad , so we wo n't be sure whether justice really will be served if they were to be judged here . 
  i do believe stripping those , that hold dual citizenship , is a step in the right direction . 
   ** they are all dual nationals ** , including british-born people with parents of different nationalities , because ministers can not take away citizenship if it would leave a suspect stateless . 
  that 's unfortunate . 
  what do you mean ? 
  actually , the more posts i read from some users on this subreddit , the more appreciative i become of our country . 
  ours seems to be nearly idyllic compared to others in my opinion . 
   no white person would dare criticize this on tv many can do so perfectly fine in the netherlands , if you do so in a respectable manner . 
  i would n't have anything against that and neither would the majority of people here . 
  i 'm a reasonable person with thick skin , so a fact-based discussion can always be had with me . 
  i 've already expressed my disagreement , as a black person for what it 's worth , so i do n't get what it is that you want . 
   meanwhile the alt right gets constantly humiliated on national television . 
  rightly so . 
  any supremacist organization should be , whether that 's african , asian or european . 
  i 'm glad you enjoyed your stay !, 
  and nigerian immigrants outperform most asians when it comes to educational attainment . 
  that does n't mean much . 
  most of it has to do with the area you grow up in . 
  one could say that it seems they 're on acid themselves . 
  who in their right mind relaxes regulations when there already are so many attacks . 
  especially when it was opposed by so many experts . 
  http://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2179035-rutte-op-zoek-naar-nieuwe-europese-vrienden.html i remembered that video ( dutch ) and it actually supports what you said . 
   i am not saying ... ah , i did n't mean to say you did that . 
  i was speaking about some people in this thread , e.g. 
  one that mentions :  this is why i am far-right !, 
  and then proceeds to post in an alt-right subreddit , heil-hitlering and spreading hate . 
  i was actually speaking about the comments here . 
  looking at the recent comment history of some in this thread reveals posts such as :  lol keep dreaming nationalism is back on the rise 1488 no reasonable person posts such things , and i doubt he/she would have a favourable opinion on a black person , regardless of level of integration . 
  if you 're not familiar with the meaning , [ here you go ] ( https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/1488 ) . 
  to me the author of the video simply seems like a confused individual that needs help . 
  i think any sane person would disapprove of this video , but it 's much more fun to some to pretend all black people agree with this person , as if they 're some kind of hivemind . 
   imagine a white dude going into an ethiopian or ghanian museum and shit talking their heroes and cultural figures and calling black people inbred and shit . 
  not to mention this video was just cringey as fuck to begin with . 
  yeah , exactly , i could n't finish it . 
   i never see white people do stuff like this black guy did and get sanctioned and approval for it . 
  really ? 
  there are entire subreddits dedicated to spreading such indiscriminate hate , e.g. 
  r/altright _ online /  black people seem to complain loudest in every society they exist in . 
  unless you give me something concrete , i ca n't really comment on that . 
  what is complaining to you ? 
  martin luther king that wanted black people to be treated equally and being given the same opportunities ? 
  please expand . 
   the turkish government going over all social posts about the dear leader and analyzing who said what ? 
  turkey does n't need any of those fancy supercomputers the nsa has when you have so many erdogan supporters in europe that are willing to rat out other turks , despite knowing what the consequences will be . 
  and which are the worst parts of america ? 
  participate in what ? 
  the democratic process ? 
  you can already do so ? 
  it 's a single video . 
  i 'm much more disappointed by the comments as a black person . 
  if your views on hundreds of thousands of black people on the continent , with all kinds of different backgrounds , are defined by some absurd video , then i just feel sorry for such people . 
  to me , they seem just as lost as this guy is . 
  you hate everything europe does , jesus christ . 
   first of all , a strong nation and a strong country does n't live on someone else 's money . 
  therefore it thanks institutions like the imf for their help , and bids them farewell : it sends them packing , and hopes that they will never have to meet again . 
  this is what took place in hungary . 
   ...  after 2010 we managed to solve this problem , and as a result hungary achieved a breakthrough in perhaps the most important aspect of strength : financial independence .
