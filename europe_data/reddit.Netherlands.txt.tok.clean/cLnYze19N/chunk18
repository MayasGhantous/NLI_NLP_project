  hungary is one of the biggest recipients of funds from the european union , it is not `` financially independent '' at all . 
  slashing the 5 billion eur it receives would be a catastrophe . 
   now , however , we can say that there is clear majority national ownership in ... the media sector . 
  we can agree on that one . 
  b i t t e r b a l l e n, 
   far from trying to `` islamicize '' the country , some syrian refugees find its version of islam too conservative for their taste . 
  exact same was mentioned on the 28th of october , 2016 by reuters : * [ reuters , in germany , syrians find mosques too conservative ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-mosques-insig-iduskcn12s0he ) do any germans know what their government is doing about this and preventing it from becoming a problem years from now ? 
  if it was banned , sure !, 
  i 'm up north , so i 'm quite ignorant on bans or other procedures regarding wildfires, 
  cool , i wish malta the best of luck !, 
  after reading the document we submitted for our own bid , i found out [ we supposedly have a video too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=174&amp;v=4ntbzbiewvy ) . 
  apparently , the cost of detaining him for five years would be ** 187.372,75 eur ** , as the average the cost per day for a detainee in france was $ 102.67 in 2015 according to the [ council of europe 's annual penal statistics ( p. 21 ) ] ( http://wp.unil.ch/space/files/2017/04/space_i_2015_finalreport_161215_rev170425.pdf ) . 
  i do n't know much about this case , so perhaps the potential five years is indeed justified , but it just sounds incredibly sad if it was unintentional . 
  perhaps some french person can tell me more about this case , i am not familiar with it . 
   meanwhile , a 41-year-old man has admitted starting a wildfire ** by accident ** with a metal-cutting device . 
   ...  the man will go to court on friday afternoon and could face ** up to five years in prison ** . 
  i know it says `` could '' , but darn , that sounds harsh for a supposed accident ? 
  they seem like good people , do n't get me wrong !, 
  i think many would think twice about approaching someone with a deadly weapon -- at least i would , i have to admit . 
  are those ... arabs or turks throwing chairs at him ? 
  pretty sure the dutch safety board has an idea , after putting the aircraft back together .

  the incident in spain is ... interesting , to say the least :  ** year ** 2013  ** summary ** 04/19/2013 : assailants mailed an explosive device hidden in a sex toy to archbishop francisco perez in pamplona , navarre province , spain . 
  this was one of at least two such devices , one of which detonated in transit . 
  no one was injured in this attack . 
  the attacks were claimed by a group that called itself the anticlerical pro sex toys group . 
  ah , sure , that might be different , but i am of the opinion that it 's really not obvious to people at all . 
  rarely do i see people pay attention to the nutritional info , let alone comparing that nutritional info with products from other countries in the eu . 
  i think this is an area where the european union might have to step in . 
  oh , wow , that twitter account is interesting !, 
  yeah , i did n't want to make my comment too long , we 're on the same page regarding that . 
   western europe wanted germany to destroy russia and literally whole slavic world . 
  what a smart one you are . 
  you figured it out all on your own !, 
  it 's the right address when it comes to reparations , but of course they would be opposed to it . 
  by omission , it made it seem as if the united states denied poland the same help , when that never was the case . 
  `` poland '' -- and i am quoting it -- denied accepting it . 
  why not ask russia for reparations ? 
   we also did n't get anything form marshall plan while nazis did . 
  was poland denied joining the marshall plan ? 
  i can understand that to some extent , but i do have to say that i find it a bit weird . 
  if i buy the same product abroad , i expect it to be the same as back home . 
  if it 's different , say so on the product ? 
  the dutch one is from 2011 [ according to our central bureau of statistics ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=03743&amp;d1=0&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=31&amp;d4=15-20&amp;hdr=t,g1,g3&amp;stb=g2&amp;vw=t ) . 
   only people who hate `` those damm foreigners '' steal `` your '' jobs think otherwise . 
  who in his/her right mind would advocate for policies that threaten their job security ? 
  lots of people lost their jobs here due to the flow of unskilled laborers who were willing to work for less . 
  it 's great for companies , but not so much for your average joe in western-europe . 
  calling members of the organization you want to join fascists and nazis did n't help either . 
  yeah , it does n't meet many of the criteria , especially the one about borders . 
  turkey has been trying to join the eec/eu when the berlin wall , soviet union and yugoslavia were around . 
  it 's sad , but such a populous country , with a lot of potential influence , should be held to a higher standard regarding membership . 
  it 's definitely not a shining beacon of what the eu stands for . 
  lost highway freaked me out , especially that telephone scene with the mystery man . 
  i 'd love to visit , especially after hearing about a friend 's visit !, 
  i do wonder what the views are on black people ( american-dutch ) are in ukraine ? 
  i was n't assuming it was serious , at least i hope it was n't . 
   europe basically did n't interact that much with africa till ... what , roughly the ** 1800 's ** ? 
  uh , what ? 
  i thought jan b\u00f6hmermann made a poem about erdogan ? 
  [ i was referring to this video . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knk7dredg3i ), 
   why would anyone want kids that do n't look like them ? 
  first and foremost , if i were to have children , i want my child to be born healthy . 
  i 'm dutch -- american ( black ) myself , my girlfriend is croatian , and my dutch grandfather is part french , so my children will be a mix of everything really . 
   i 'd also like to preserve our family customs , language and culture . 
  culturally i am dutch , even my girlfriend points it out to me and whenever i visit family it is obvious to me that i am different due to being raised in the netherlands . 
  for many other people with an immigrant background this is also the case . 
   something that took generations to create can be lost forever in a matter of decades due to immigration and social policy . 
  it 's very sad . 
  can you give me an example regarding the netherlands ? 
   please tell me what is so funny about being a patriot and wanting to preserve your culture and genealogy ? 
  nobody 's stopping you from doing so by finding another like minded individual ? 
  to me it sounds that you do not like others having intercourse with non-germans , e.g. 
  south american , african , asian or what have you . 
  the twelve stars on the european flag have nothing to do with the current twenty-eight member states of the european union . 
  of course it does . 
  it 's made to look like the dutch flag . 
   bombardier is such an odd name for civilian aircraft . 
  bombardiers to your stations .

  i thought we were supposed to invest in eastern poland ? 
  good move , but it 's much more than food labeling is n't it ? 
  i thought persil and other products had different contents too ? 
  yeah , i 'm not sure what they did with that . 
  anecdotally , i found [ some dutch -- czech forum post ] ( https://www.tsjechie.net/forum/threads/correctie-nationaliteit.372/ ) where one was sent a letter by his municipality in which he had to declare his proper nationality by submitting either official czech or slovak documents , as holding czechoslovak nationality was deemed impossible by said municipality due to the dissolution of czechoslovakia . 
  i assume that in order to remove the group `` czechoslovakia '' everyone in that group would have to identify as either czech or slovak . 
  i tried googling it and it seems some from ( former ) czechoslovakia were asked to do so . 
  the same applies to ( former ) yugoslavia and the ( former ) dutch antilles and aruba . 
  for which primary nationality one holds , or in which country one was born , there are different lists . 
   hollandok hollandi\u00e1b\u00f3l holland-ok ? 
  not ok !, 
   niderlandy right ? 
  it is by _ herkomstgroepering _ , which is explained in [ their list of definitions ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/methoden/begrippen?tab=h ) . 
  if i understand it correctly , here 's a quick translation :  ** herkomstgroepering **  with which country a person is connected based on their country of origin or that of their parents . 
   ** explanation **  a first generation foreigner 's _ herkomstgroepering _ will be the country where he/she was born . 
   a second generation foreigner 's _ herkomstgroepering _ will be the mother 's country of origin , unless she was born in the netherlands . 
  in that case , the _ herkomstgroepering _ will be the father 's country of origin . 
  so for one not to be considered czech by _ herkomstgroepering _ , both of their parents would have to be born in the netherlands .
