  thanks , but without a source i have my doubts about our economy primarily running on people picking tomatoes . 
   western european countries have benefited a lot through the expansion of the eu , in exports ... to my knowledge , we still [ barely export ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=81266ned&amp;d1=1&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=27,71,84,94,113,129,192,195-196,244&amp;d4=12,25,38,51,64,77,90&amp;hdr=t,g3&amp;stb=g1,g2&amp;charttype=3&amp;vw=t ) to the countries that the eu has expanded to in recent years ? 
  i assume any country 's dislike of the eu would grow if it had to pay large sums of money [ virtually without notice ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/24/david-cameron-refuses-pay-eu-bill-december-deadline ) . 
  i am simply trying to explain the ever growing cynicism here . 
  cool , i did not know that , i appreciate the correction . 
  pretty much actually , most are swayed by the dumbest of conspiracy theories pumped out by russia today . 
  as if handing out all that money to erdogan was n't enough , let 's just hand some more over to islamist militias . 
  you 've got to be kidding me ... 
  what 's not to love about being a top contributor to the eu , a loss of jobs due to foreign workers being cheaper than dutch ones . 
  blame the ** average joe ** here for not seeing all those wonderful positives and becoming more cynical . 
  i am black ( african-american/dutch ) myself , but if this is a serious issue , then of course it should be tackled . 
  i went to the page the fbi has on ** hate crime ** statistics and quickly looked at some . 
  ** hate crime victims by racial bias . 
  ** | 2010 ( 3.949 victims ) | 2011 ( 3.465 victims ) | 2012 ( 3.467 victims ) | 2013 ( 3.407 victims ) | 2014 ( 3.227 victims ) -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- anti-black or african american | 70.0 % | 72.0 % | 66.2 % | 66.4 % | 62.7 % anti-white | 17.7 % | 16.7 % | 22.0 % | 21.4 % | 22.7 % anti-american indian or alaska native | 1.2 % | 1.9 % | 3.3 % | 4.3 % | 4.6 % anti-multiple races , group | 6.0 % | 4.7 % | 4.4 % | 3.2 % | 3.7 % anti-asian/pacific islander | 5.1 % | 4.8 % | 4.1 % | 4.7 % | 6.3 % https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/ i 'd say that if nearly three quarters of ** hate crime ** victims are black _ and _ taking into account that the black population in the united states is around 15 % that this should worry one far more . 
  i already dealt with it . 
  i love it here . 
    i 'm dutch/african-american , so by your logic i should n't be here . 
   correct . 
  you are not european . 
  btw i bet it was your father that was black because black women are super ugly and most black men are hypocritical in that they do n't want a women who was fathered by a black men like themselves . 
    dutch history in some ways is intertwined with surinamese and indonesian too , so should they not be here too ? 
   nope . 
  do n't they want independence ? 
  sounds like they do n't . 
  having indonesians move to the netherlands is just colonialism all over again . 
  the netherlands is an extremely tiny country with few resources . 
  it should just be for europeans , 95 % of that being dutch . 
    quite some right-wing dutch people would not be fond of your pan-european idea at all and would gladly shut the door for polish , romanians and many other european nationalities , so do n't think others would get a free pass . 
   fine with me . 
  netherlands is super tiny and overcrowded . 
  i have no problem with it being only for dutch people . 
    the municipal level , amsterdam is only for people from amsterdam . 
  we could go on forever . 
   you are confusing nation with city . 
  different things . 
  city has nothing to do with ethnicity . 
    as long as you properly integrate , most people here will be perfectly fine with it . 
   integration is impossible for non-white people . 
  if you are n't genetically the same as the native people , then you ca n't integrate . 
  you even said that you are black , the dutch ethnicity is a white ethnicity . 
  you might have lived there your whole life , but you will never be the same as a dutch person , simply because you are black . 
   a lot of far-leftists hear `` you will never be dutch because you are black '' and think `` he thinks we are sub-humans ! '' . 
  that is a false equivalency . 
  not being dutch does not mean your intelligence is lower . 
  it simply means you are foreign to this entire continent , you are not european , you are not dutch . 
  if anything , it means those far-left people are white supremacists since they believe that european ethnicities are superior to non-european ethnicities . 
  ** edit : ** his comment was removed . 
  i am just going to put it up here , so people can see . 
  i feel sorry for you . 
  i have learned in my life that there can be hateful black people and hateful white people . 
  you are part of the latter it seems . 
  i am very proud of both sides when it comes to my heritage , it taught me to respect people regardless of skin color . 
  i 'm dutch and african american , deal with it \u2642, 
  there is nothing to understand . 
  it 's just intolerance . 
  he/she does n't want them here because of the way others look . 
  even people that integrate properly are apparently not welcome judging by the reaction to my post below . 
  i find such ideas laughable , as your average right-winger here would love to see a stop to the current european migration that the european union 's freedom of labor allows for . 
  same applied to the united kingdom . 
  a significant amount of dutch people however , from what i believe , will be cool with it * if you properly integrate * , whether you are chinese , african or polish is not a significant factor . 
  no , you do n't understand . 
  facebook should only allow _ the right kind _ of intolerance !, 
   with the amount of non-europeans that have swamped europe in the past few decades , i 'm willing to say `` enough is enough '' . 
  yes . 
  europe should only be for europeans ( white people ) . 
  i 'm dutch/african-american , so by your logic i should n't be here . 
  dutch history in some ways is intertwined with surinamese and indonesian too , so should they not be here too ? 
  quite some right-wing dutch people would not be fond of your pan-european idea at all and would gladly shut the door for polish , romanians and many other european nationalities , so do n't think others _ would _ get a free pass . 
  they _ do n't _ . 
  i personally do n't agree with this way of thinking at all , as we can set the arbitrary treshold for who is or is not allowed anywhere . 
  the continental level , europe is only for europeans ; the national level , the netherlands is only for dutch people ; the municipal level , amsterdam is only for people from amsterdam . 
  we could go on forever . 
  ** as long as you properly integrate ** , most people here will be perfectly fine with it . 
  tell me that when we have guys on television like zhirinovsky calling other european countries being part of gayropa and how we should and will be nuked . 
  that is quite a bold claim , can you please provide statistics on this ? 
   can ** n ** on fodder i actually liked the idea of someone feeding cannons like ducks . 
  darn , i thought our trains could be disgusting . 
  i 'd puke if i saw this . 
  never understood why people throw shit on the floor in trains or next to the roads while driving around . 
   it is widely acknowledged that within 10 years almost all programming and coding will be outsourced to indians who will do it on the cheap . 
  it _ really _ is not . 
  being able to properly communicate is a big thing in programming . 
  ask capgemini how outsourcing their fantastic work for the sociale verzekeringsbank to indians went in the netherlands . 
  kapsalon and stroopwafels keeps our hearts going . 
  all i have heard from a croatian is that they are supposedly corrupt , hell-bent on giving more money to war veterans for support and making sure religion is an important aspect in education . 
  basically what i took from it was that their political system seems quite polarized . 
  any croatians are welcome to chime in and add to that . 
  perhaps , your jokes are just awful if _ everyone else _ does n't like them .

  thanks , that 's sad and creepy ... 
   and lately a murderer who strolled around with a corpse in a wheelbarrow . 
  what ? 
  from my experiences they do not in the netherlands . 
  although anecdotal , which is what you are basing it on too i assume . 
  to me , there is actually nothing wrong with that . 
  as if one 's values are tied to his/her name . 
   allowing a few thousand parents to home school their children out of millions is not going to be deterimental to society in any way . 
  it would however be detrimental to those children . 
  good enough to not let something like that happen .
