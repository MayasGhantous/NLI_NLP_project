   put yourself in their shoes . 
  i did !, 
  i said `` i ca n't blame someone for looking for other options . '', 
  i understand that most would do so , if it made life easier for them . 
  i was mostly wondering what the irish point of view was on the situation . 
   the spefic hatred of eastern europeans is almost exclusively a western european thing . 
  [ do consider that 160.000 polish live in the netherlands alone ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=37325&amp;d1=0&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=178&amp;d6=1,6,11,16,l&amp;hdr=g2,g3&amp;stb=g1,g5,t,g4&amp;charttype=0&amp;vw=t ) . 
  it 's not a surprise that a few of these incidents will happen , and many more live in the u.k. 
  * belgium was the second country in the world to legalise same-sex marriages . 
  * belgian men are the second tallest in the world . 
  * antwerp is europe 's second largest port . 
  second an awful lot ;-) no , belgium , you guys do have a beautiful country . 
  having seen the images of the fires they had to face , one ca n't say that 's not badass . 
  how do irish people feel about this ? 
  i ca n't blame someone for looking for other options , but to me it kind of sounds like `` passport shopping '' , where one cares more about the rights that passports grants them than actually becoming an irish citizen . 
  thanks for the answer . 
  i assume this would be at the same stores , such as lidl ? 
  i 've seen this before . 
  last time i heard , besides quality , the prices were also vastly different ? 
  and they 're not fond of one calling it `` patat '' instead of `` friet '' either . 
  just warning you . 
   not really a new thing that people in west are racist towards people in east of europe . 
  ** you will experience that in any corner of the world . 
  whether you are in australia , africa , europe or asia . 
  ** it 's not exclusive to western-europe . 
  i 'm dutch myself and even in the netherlands i have experienced plenty of real racism due to my skin color as a child and during my teenage years ( dutch mother , african-american father ) . 
  the large majority , however , is n't racist . 
  and that 's what matters . 
  did n't greece suggest northern-macedonia ? 
  i 've seen vardar mentioned too in a previous thread ? 
  would denmark ( in theory ) be able to block them from entering ? 
  i 'm not familiar with which routes ships use to enter the baltic sea . 
  well , you ca n't assimilate more than that i guess . 
  unfortunately not . 
   ** on thursday , april 20th a rotterdam court ruled that t-mobile 's zero rated service `` data free music '' is legal . 
  the court declared that the dutch net neutrality law , which prohibits zero rating , is not in accordance with the eu net neutrality law that brussels lawmakers passed last year . 
  **  zero rating is bad for the long term health of the internet . 
  by disrupting the level playing field and allowing discrimination , zero rating poses a threat to users , competition , and opportunity online . 
   the netherlands has been a model to the world in protecting net neutrality . 
  it 's alarming to see these vital protections for users , competition , and opportunity online struck down . 
   the power and potential of the internet is greatest when users can access the full diversity of the open internet , not just some parts of it . 
  we urge the authority for consumers & markets ( acm ) to appeal this decision swiftly , and we hope that higher courts will restore the internet 's level playing field .

   why do so many people in mainland greece even vote for a fascist neo-nazi party ? 
  they do n't seem to do as well in places such as crete and others . 
  an answer as to why there is such a difference in voting patterns in greece . 
  not the typical incoherent refugee mumbo-jumbo . 
  definitely sucks . 
  we had better laws regarding net neutrality that did not allow for zero-rating . 
  now we have worse laws due to the eu 's net neutrality laws that do allow for zero-rating . 
  europe is not the wild west , but a social market economy . 
  shots fired . 
  what do refugees have to do with breaking the ribcage and nose of an employed pakistani migrant worker , who is now , due to that racist attack , unemployed ? 
  did you watch the video ? 
  seems golden dawn 's doing a great job at raising the unemployment rate . 
  attacking a migrant worker that now is unable to work . 
  i hope he will recover .

  i was confused for a moment by the title until i realized that it said `` bering sea '' , meaning it 's _ literally _ on the other side of the world , near the kamchatka peninsula . 
  perhaps i should have sticked to rgb , cmyk or any other color scheme . 
  our bonus culture definitely is not as attractive as in other places . 
  red , white and blue ? 
  i 'm sure some of them will go to france and the netherlands .

  from what i understand , many here are so oppposed to dual-cirizenship due to certain minorities feeling more attached to their ( parent 's ) home countries , even if they were born here . 
  i think that is what fuels it . 
  nobody ever really made an issue out of m\u00e1xima zorreguieta , our queen , and of argentinian descent , having dual-citizenship . 
   wants russia to join nato [ is this real life ? 
  oh , yeah , i was just trying to emphasize that . 
  obviously , to exert power over what people should or should not watch is the entire point here . 
  i think my response might have been a bit harsh , as from my own perspective it is indeed not the end of the world . 
  nobody has become ill to my knowledge . 
  for the more religious -- those that truly do not want one bit of pig or horse meat -- i think they would be better off finding one of many islamic butchers here . 
  i somehow doubt it would be that big of a deal if you did not do it knowingly , but i am not an expert on religion , so that is conjecture . 
   if it was revealed that i have been eating horse meat but i did not get what i payed for so i would be irritated on a secular level . 
  i completely agree and i ca n't think of any person that would support false advertising . 
  cows , sheep and many others have human-like teeth , so i assume you mean non-human-like teeth ? 
  i think that 's the case . 
  i 'm not entirely sure on what other animals are or are not haram . 
  is that nico rosberg ? 
  is n't he german ? 
   users may be asked to provide credit card details , as gambling websites do . 
  sounds like an awful idea . 
  who would dare to look for the porn they 're _ really _ looking for if it could potentially be tied to your account ? 
  besides , if most major porn websites would only perform a simple ip check , it could be circumvented in many ways and would be ineffective . 
  _ `` if you are from the jewish or muslim faith , that must be an absolutely horrific revelation .

  [ the same was done to ukrainian prisoners in donetsk .

   i hope you have more terrorism that 's not a very nice wish . 
  is n't organized crime involved in the smuggling of people , and thus earning money on that `` business '' in italy ? 
   poor black people are an extreme outlier in our country . 
  their communities are plagued with violence and poverty , and they inflate statistics ... 
  i 'd say past and current policies in the united states had quite an effect on that . 
  this is akin to saying `` let 's not count amsterdam and the hague , because a lot more crime occurs in those places . '', 
   moreover , you recently got a wave of refugees but you refuse to acknowledge that the us has way more immigrants/refugees than europe what do you mean by that ? 
  how many refugees did the united states take in ? 
   europe is doing a shit job at integrating migrants .
