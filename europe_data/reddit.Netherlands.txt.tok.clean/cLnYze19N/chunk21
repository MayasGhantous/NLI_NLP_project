  iit sounds as if you are lumping all european countries together , while they have different policies when it comes to integration . 
  i think we 're doing an okay-ish job compared to other countries . 
  congratulations on your telescreen !, 
  darn , [ why not get one of these ] ( https://media.huren.nl/product/4729-xl-huur-een-fietskar.jpg ) ? 
  you see those quite often here . 
  haha , the most intense drops here would probably be the sidewalks, 
  i actually recently visited the national maritime museum ( building on the very left ) with my dutch grandfather . 
  museum exceeded my expectations , and i still have some great pictures . 
  the blue mountain bike has a children 's seat ? 
  that 's intense . 
  cool !, 
  i always enjoy the delay in sound . 
  what will they do with this demolished area ? 
  will something new be built ? 
  it sounds like she wanted to see frozen . 
   it 's called identitarianism so basically a modern day segregationist ? 
  it more or less sounds like a euphemism . 
   for those who are confused by the point of this video , the point is that france is changing forever due to mass immigration . 
  the people in this video were not speaking french , the women were not wearing their hair in french braids , they had their head scarves on . 
  when i was driving from the airport i saw people being fed from volunteer aid vans in the syrian zones and coming up to your cars with signs in arabic . 
  the posters on the walls and the protesters yelled refugees welcome . 
  much of what you are looking at is not legal or proper migration and assimilation . 
  france will not be france for long . 
  haha , that 's funny , i came to the same conclusion yesterday [ in another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6n8ckg/vice_prime_minister_of_russia_rogozin_says_nato/dk7rx6v/ ) . 
  ah , fair enough !, 
  have a good day !, 
  that 's interesting , thanks . 
  i 've heard of the cultural aspect before . 
  concerning the anecdote , that sounds sad in some way , as i ca n't imagine the stress of your entire family having to pitch in and betting on you . 
  reminds me of the fact that i have n't yet checked the new episode from the new season . 
  hmmm , surprised to see nigerians ( yoruba ) perform well . 
  i wonder what it is about them , as they outperform `` african-americans '' and other groups in the united states too last time i checked . 
  still makes me laugh : [ `` leave me about an inch from where the zipper [ burps ] ends , round , under my , back to my bunghole '' ] ( https://youtu.be/s3gt9un7ndo?t=132 ), 
  i 'm surprised as well , but i think it 's been banned here only recently . 
   also , america is about 30 % german - the largest immigration group , for that matter . 
  hmmm , out of curiosity , where are you getting this ** 30 % ** from ? 
  using the [ u.s. census bureau 's factfinder ] ( https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml ) , you can get actual population for races and ethnic groups . 
  it also lines up with the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_americans ) on german-americans . 
  click `` advanced search '' 2 . 
  add the topic `` american community survey '' 3 . 
  add the topic `` 2015 '' for the latest data 4 . 
  click the `` race and ethnic groups '' , button on the left , then click on `` detailed groups '' and search for `` german '' or any other group . 
  the table _ total population _ , with the above filters applied , then gives me this for the following groups : ethnic background | total | percent -- | -- | -- all | 321.418.821 | 100 % german | 46.403.053 | 14.4 % mexican | 34.640.287 | 10.8 % irish | 33.526.444 | 10.4 % italian | 17.285.619 | 5.4 % polish | 9.385.766 | 2.9 % french ( except basque ) | 8.272.538 | 2.6 % dutch | 4.289.116 | 1.3 %, 
  dr. phil is not amused . 
  the rejected ones indeed are interesting , to say the least . 
  here are the dutch ones :  ** the oath , for those who are religious : ** ' i swear that i will respect the constitutional order of the kingdom of the netherlands , its liberties and rights and i swear that i will faithfully fulfil the duties which this citizenship imposes on me . ', 
  followed by : ` so help me god . ', 
   ** and for those who so choose , the solemn affirmation : ** ' i declare that i will respect the constitutional order of the kingdom of the netherlands , its liberties and rights and i declare and promise that i will faithfully fulfil the duties which this citizenship imposes on me . ', 
  followed by : ` this i declare and promise . ', 
  * [ immigration and naturalisation service , naturalisation day ] ( https://ind.nl/en/about-ind/background-themes/pages/naturalisation-day.aspx ) does romania have anything similar ? 
  hahaha , as much as i would love for the netherlands to have mountains , [ the picture you linked ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y9jf1hs.jpg ) actually is [ huis ten bosch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/huis_ten_bosch_ ( theme_park \\ ) ) a japanese theme park :  the park features many dutch-style buildings such as hotels , villas , theatres , museums , shops and restaurants , along with canals , windmills , amusement rides , and a park planted in seasonal flowers . 
  huis ten bosch , which opened on march 25 , 1992 , is located on hario island in the southern part of sasebo , facing \u014cmura bay . 
  its location reflects historical relations between the netherlands and japan , which began in 1609 when a trading post was opened by the dutch in hirado , not far from sasebo . 
  i think you 're correct . 
  there 's [ a list of definitions ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/methoden/begrippen?tab=b#bevolking ) that they use and the one one for _ `` bevolking '' _ basically says :  anyone living in the netherlands for an indefinite amount of time will be added to the population register ** by their municipality ** . 
  those that are part of the population of the netherlands but do not have a permanent residence , will be added to the population register of the hague . 
  concerning numbers , i am not sure how many german/dutch people commute to the other country for work . 
  that already is the case , no ? 
  you can change the language to dutch , english , turkish and polish . 
  we just do n't use credit cards really as a method of payment . 
  the majority of online shopping here uses [ ideal ] ( https://www.ideal.nl/en/ ) . 
  that 's why i 've mostly been hesitant . 
  dear god , i remember such a post . 
   this is why i usually try to speak english and recently started to learn dutch . 
  awesome ... or gruwelijk !, 
  how are you liking it so far ? 
   are n't the germans officially holland 's largest minority at around 10 % of population though ? 
  if i 'm reading it correctly , and according to our central bureau of statistics , that would be 360.116 in 2016 , so that is ( 360116 / 16979120 ) * 100 = 2.1 % of our population ? 
  there are bigger minorities though to my knowledge , although they are definitely one of the bigger ones . 
  yes , i was looking for that one !, 
  it 's also in german , so they can better understand what 's going on . 
  thanks !, 
   waste thousands , if not millions on useless architecture ? 
  there 's a joke about [ strasbourg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seat_of_the_european_parliament_in_strasbourg#principal_building ) in there , somewhere . 
  yeah , i thought [ seeing them patrol together in one car ( 2:50 ) ] ( https://youtu.be/v4tyjuempvu?t=159 ) along the border was great -- and pretty cute to see a german speak dutch . 
  i 'd be glad , it sounds quite cringey to me . 
  as if the northern and western countries would start military exercises titled `` germanic brotherhood . '', 
  i ca n't speak for the irish , but the way they 're going about brexit seems careless when taking northern-ireland into account ? 
   we should really do a join european project for ... tanks [ like the leopard 3 ? 
  ] ( http://m.dw.com/en/germany-france-to-jointly-develop-leopard-3-tank/a-18468270 ) but i definitely agree . 
  i find the religious message , including the anti-abortion , anti-euthanasia stance , very off-putting . 
  it reminds me of a conservative , right-wing politician here named kees van der staaij ( sgp ) . 
  yeah , i think we 're on the same page . 
  nah , i was speaking about those that demanded the referendum . 
  this was possible due to to a new law that came into effect on the 1st of july , 2015 ( [ wet raadgevend referendum ] ( http://wetten.overheid.nl/bwbr0036443/2017-04-01 ) ) . 
  it made it possible for us to hold advisory referendums once 300.000 ( digital ) signatures for one had been collected . 
  the organization that was one of the initiators of this entire thing ( burgercomit\u00e9 eu ) even mentioned that they could n't give a fuck about ukraine basically , it was more or less an afterthought . 
   ** english : ** `` ukraine does n't matter to us at all of course , you have to understand '' , says historian arjan van dixhoorn , president of the citizen 's committee eu . 
  the founders only have one goal . 
  to destroy the european union , or to get the netherlands out of it , so that would be a nexit . 
  `` a nexit-referendum has n't been possible yet . 
  that is why we try to use every opportunity available to us to strain the relationship between the netherlands and the eu '' , van dixhoorn explains . 
  i listed the reasons [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mlfel/eu_formally_approves_ukraine_association_agreement/dk2p8lp/ ) . 
  most important reasons to vote for -- argument | frequency -- | -- to support the people of ukraine | 37.7 % economic advantages | 21,0 % right to vote | 7,9 % against russia or putin | 7,2 % for the eu | 6,7 % against those that organized the referendum | 1,5 % [ nationaal referendum onderzoek 2016 ] ( http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/813323/web_96646_onderzoeksrapport_nro_2016nw.pdf ) , p. 17 most important reasons to vote against -- argument | frequency -- | -- the corruption in ukraine | 34,1 % fear of ukraine becoming a member of the eu | 16,6 % vote against the eu | 7,5 % to not anger putin or russia | 4,5 % vote against the government | 3,2 % right to vote | 2,3 % [ nationaal referendum onderzoek 2016 ] ( http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/813323/web_96646_onderzoeksrapport_nro_2016nw.pdf ) , p. 18, 
   to fuck over ~ ~ ukraine ~ ~ the european union for shits and giggles ? 
  the above is pretty much what they wanted . 
  \u0295 \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 \u0294, 
  that bouncer was apparently also banned from other bars ( plural ) due to violent behavior ... 
  wow , unbelievable . 
  i ca n't believe how this guy is sucking up to erdogan , especially after he called fellow eu member states nazi 's and fascists .
