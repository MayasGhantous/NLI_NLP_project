  furthermore , he loves patting hungary and hungarians on the back . 
   i would also consider the fact that hungary is part of a special alliance system , known as the v4 , comprising the central european countries of poland , the czech republic , slovakia and hungary . 
  today these four central european countries account for the majority of european economic growth . 
  without central europe , growth in the european union would be almost imperceptible -- or non-existent . 
  this clearly indicates that the economic centre of gravity is shifting from the western countries towards central europe . 
  whoever is in central europe is at the very centre of european economic growth . 
   ...  the third thing to remember is that you should praise hungarians -- this really helps in business . 
   ...  finally , however , if there is an opportunity you may mention the fact that over the years hungary has won 176 olympic gold medals . 
  although we are a country of ten million , this figure places us in the front rank of the world 's nations , and is yet another achievement which hungarians like to see as proof of us being great warriors who are capable of extraordinary things in difficult situations . 
  i mean , i 'll stop here before i 'm pasting the entire thing , but it reads like a giant humblebrag . 
  thanks for linking it by the way . 
   if you 've seen orban 's latest trip to turkey , you notice that they 're all very chummy with each other sincere question , but really ? 
  orb\u00e1n 's as anti-migrant as they come in europe and he 's chummy with erdogan ? 
  the same man who threatened to unleash hordes of people into europe , into hungary 's direction ? 
  i 'll look it up later . 
  i get that people unfortunately do that , but i expect better from sam harris though . 
  tar, 
  wishing for the death of children , classy . 
  of course the racists come out in full swing . 
  i 'm not saying that it would disappear over night , but let 's not pretend russia does not play a major part in it ? 
  they could 've put an end to it by now , but apparently endless supplies of military hardware grows on trees in donbas . 
   reacting to mr poroshenko 's remarks , a russian government spokesman , dmitry peskov , said : `` for many years russia has been worried by nato 's military infrastructure moving closer to our borders , potentially this could be the next step . 
   `` it will not boost stability and security in the european continent . '', 
  actually , it ** would ** boost stability and security for ukraine . 
  god , the nerve , how he can say that over so many killed ukrainians due to their incursions is disgusting . 
  what he 's saying is n't even correct , unless he 's going to claim `` de unie '' is more reliable than ipsos : ** level of education per party ** party | low | middle | high | -- | -- | -- | -- vvd ( people 's party for freedom and democracy ) | 11 % | 14 % | 22 % | d66 ( democrats ' 66 ) | 5 % | 8 % | 17 % | groenlinks ( greenleft ) | 5 % | 7 % | 13 % | non-voter | 31 % | 19 % | 11 % | cda ( christian democratic appeal ) | 9 % | 11 % | 10 % | other party | 8 % | 10 % | 8 % | pvda ( labor party ) | 3 % | 5 % | 6 % | cu/sgp ( christian union / reformed political party ) | 3 % | 5 % | 5 % | sp ( socialist party ) | 9 % | 10 % | 4 % | pvv ( party for freedom ) | 16 % | 11 % | 4 % | * [ ipsos , jong of oud , man of vrouw ; wie stemde op welke partij ?

  / r/mildlyinfuriating, 
  that 's hilarious , i wish you guys the best of luck . 
  what i meant is that you ca n't apply current rules , for new member states , to the ones that created it and were thus `` grandfathered in '' as / u/itscalledunicode stated . 
  the schengen agreement was amended and supplemented as time went on of course . 
  what ? 
  we did n't become `` part '' of schengen , the benelux created it with france and germany : * [ eur-lex , the schengen acquis - agreement between the governments of the states of the benelux economic union , the federal republic of germany and the french republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=celex:42000a0922\\ ( 01 \\ ) & qid = 1499618548496 & from = en ), 
   iz gr\u010dke policije za afp is that `` greek police to agence france-presse '' or something else ? 
   after 1945 we were under the soviet occupation , while germany was enjoying freedom . 
  so all that were arrested , including the bouncer that was banned from other bars due to violent behavior , were of serbian origin . 
  norway always looks lovely . 
  also , i think i saw [ a movie ( b\u00f8lgen ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3616916/ ) about this exact place a while ago !, 
  why would they do that ? 
  he is ten years old . 
  it really angers and saddens me to see adults treat a child like that . 
  i must be misinterpreting your comment . 
   while right extremists focus them self on illegal immigrants so called refugees anyone that looks foreign , not just illegal immigrants or refugees . 
  can you please explain what the heck of it is going on in [ this video ] ( https://vk.com/zentrizm?w=wall-105459597_459 ) ? 
  running it through a quick google translate mentions `` hamlet '' and i remember that thread about a boy being arrested just for reading it out loud . 
  is this him being arrested ? 
  i thought you were making a joke , but :  he walks to the window , behind which hamburg 's alster lake is twinkling . 
  he looks into the camera and sinks his chin . 
  and smiles -- and holds his smile . 
  he tenses his biceps -- his sleeves were already rolled up when he walked into the room -- and leans forward slightly . 
  he 's ready . 
  i guess this is fifty shades of trudeau or something . 
  it opens many doors for their economy ? 
  the backdoor you mean ? 
  i wonder if the u.k. will have much of a say in those negotiations , because we do have to remember it 's america first . 
  buzz aldrin 's face is priceless . 
  sincere question , but lithuania does n't have a lot of ethnic russians right ? 
  / u/amanyoucantrust did n't you move to the u.s ? 
  thank you !, 
  i 'll have a look at it when i 'm home . 
  unbelievable . 
  it looks as if he/she 's driving through mosul . 
  thanks !, 
  that 's interesting . 
  i really wonder what on earth gives the water that color . 
  many tourist pages mention its emerald color . 
  i found pictures where it 's blue , but also pictures where it 's green . 
  perhaps it 's a seasonal thing ? 
  absolutely no idea . 
  the photo you linked is from the same angle , more or less , so i 'm even more puzzled . 
  honest question , does anybody know how effective these are ? 
  i recently had someone tell me they are n't effective at all and a waste of money . 
  i just wonder if that 's true or not . 
  my assumption would be that before starting such big projects , they would take the amount of crossings , prevented accidents and many other factors into account . 
  yes , in belgium and the netherlands we call fries `` patat '' :-), 
  i loved this part in [ king leopold 's ghost ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_leopold%27s_ghost ) :  a french marshal who saw him at a reception in paris in 1867 thought him conspicuous `` by his great height , his great nose , and his great beard ; with his sword , which banged his legs , he looked like a functionary who had put on his uniform without knowing how to wear it . '', 
  ** everyone was struck by the nose . 
  `` it is such a nose , '' disraeli wrote , `` as a young prince has in a fairy tale , who has been banned by a malignant fairy . 
  i have it too , it 's a great book indeed !, 
  i think wealth in resources is their problem . 
  others have an interest in these resources too . 
  it looks like its filled with [ mountain dew ] ( http://www.mountaindew.com/assets/meta/facebook.jpg ) , but i 'm assuming its particles of trees and other materials that give it this color ? 
   just to be sure , you counted both murder and manslaughter , right ? 
  since the estonian graph combines both . 
  murder by itself is less . 
  yes , they 're combined . 
  regardless , those are massive decreases in homicides , so that 's a good thing . 
  concerning the causes of death , as you mentioned , i do wonder how much is part of organized crime here . 
  it does mention the causes of death and the amount of firearm related deaths , which accounts for a third . 
   but then we never actually really seem to do anything about it . 
  well , yeah , some parties do n't like it , even though there was a majority in our second chamber for 2025 if i recall correctly . 
  have n't followed what happened to it . 
  would n't surprise me if it got tossed into the bin along the way .

  wow , that 's insane , i just compared the murder rates between the netherlands and estonia . 
  glad things are improving quickly though . 
  estonia year | population | homicides | rate per 100.000 -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 1996 | 1425192 | 293 | 20.6 2005 | 1358850 | 123 | 9.1 2015 | 1313271 | 42 | 3.2 * [ statistics estonia , estonian population ] ( http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/dialog/varval.asp?ma=po021&amp;ti=population+by+sex+and+age+group%2c+1+january&amp;path=../i_databas/population/01population_indicators_and_composition/04population_figure_and_composition/&amp;lang=1 ) the netherlands year | population | homicides | rate per 100.000 -- | -- | -- | -- 1996 | 15493889 | 240 | 1.5 2005 | 16305526 | 197 | 1.2 2015 | 16900726 | 120 | 0.7 * [ central bureau of statistics , dutch population ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=70634ned&amp;d1=0&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=0,9,19&amp;hdr=t,g4&amp;stb=g3,g2,g1&amp;vw=t ) * [ central bureau of statistics , murder and manslaughter ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=81453ned&amp;d1=0,2-6&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=0,9,l&amp;hdr=g1,t&amp;stb=g2,g3&amp;vw=t ), 
  to me , 2040 sounds way too late , definitely at the rate electric cars are becoming more and more common . 
  more than 20 years into the future is a long time .
