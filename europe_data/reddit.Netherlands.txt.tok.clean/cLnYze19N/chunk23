  considering [ donald 's attitude ] ( http://time.com/4465744/donald-trump-undocumented-workers/ ) , that 's pretty funny in a sad way :  in the summer of 1980 , donald trump faced a big problem . 
  for six months , undocumented polish laborers had been clearing the future site of trump tower , his signature real estate project on manhattan 's fifth avenue , where he now lives , maintains his private offices and hosts his presidential campaign . 
   ...  the men were putting in 12-hour shifts with inadequate safety equipment at subpar wages that their contractor paid sporadically , if at all . 
  a lawyer for many of the poles demanded that the workers be paid or else he would serve trump with a lien on the property . 
  one polish worker even went to trump 's office to ask him for money in person , according to sworn testimony and a deposition filed under oath in a court case . 
  yeah , `` unfortunately '' we are not average . 
  whichever way you look at it , 2 -- 3 years for _ acceptance _ or even _ same-sex marriage _ does n't apply to us . 
  i think he 's quoting timmermans his numbers , which uhm ... * [ nos , goochelt frans timmermans met cijfers ?

  quite [ a lot ] ( https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/asielbeleid/vraag-en-antwoord/toegelaten-asielzoekers-afgewezen ) also seem to be rejected too . 
  looking at _ migrant arrivals _ paints a different picture of course . 
  does n't really matter if they 're deported anyway . 
   chinese people would be pretty surprised and insulted i really ca n't care any less . 
  once again , we 're not speaking about ethnicity . 
  someone who lived his/her entire life abroad , was born there , does n't magically become something else the moment they move here or to any other place . 
  indeed that does not matter , because we are not chinese , so we do n't look at such matters from their perspective . 
  ethnicity and nationality are different things . 
  i do n't see anybody arguing here that the guy ethnically is french or english . 
  just that he 's british . 
  i do n't think simply being born in _ country _ counts . 
  whether you were raised there , inherited the culture and language also plays quite a role . 
  if you spent the majority of your life , from birth , in china , i 'm going to view you as chinese . 
  [ that 's right , friendship ended ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cwuu8sm.jpg ), 
  looks lovely !, 
  i 'd love to visit malta some time . 
  what is that building in the background ? 
  even m\u00e1xima , our queen , still has her argentinian passport , no ? 
  at least i remember sybrand buma mentioning even she had to give it up , if it was up to him . 
  yeah , even africa does better than the eurozone in that regard , but are you going to claim that africa is less misogynistic than the eurozone too ? 
  strangers ? 
  concerning the netherlands , i have n't really experienced it myself , although i 'm sure it happens , i 'm just not sure to what extent . 
  i ca n't really speak for others of course . 
  anti-gay violence is also a thing here , so there are bound to be some that will say such things unprovoked unfortunately . 
  germany and the netherlands took in a lot of refugees from former yugoslavia in the '90s , i 'm not sure what you 're on about . 
   it 's disgust/contempt , not anger . 
  it 's also not about `` liking another person '' , but about being feminine so you dislike femininity among men , regardless whether the person is heterosexual or homosexual ? 
  to add to that , there are `` feminine '' heterosexual guys too , of course . 
  that life will be difficult for you if the sight of two guys marrying or being together freaks you out . 
  why do you say that ? 
  dear god , the image of may at 00:12 , haha . 
  the stuff of nightmares . 
  huh , how do those from bangladesh end up in italy ? 
  that 's around 7000 kilometers . 
  yeah , unfortunately . 
  it 's sad for those in groningen who are faced with those earthquakes . 
  i wonder which steps will be made in order for us to be less dependant on it ? 
  one day we 'll [ run out ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2016/37/aardgas-voor-bijna-80-procent-op ) . 
  great photo !, 
  is this your backyard and is that a mountain in the distance ? 
  you seem more well-versed on this subject , but we have the largest gas field in europe do n't we ? 
   the groningen gas field is a giant natural gas field located near slochteren in groningen province in the northeastern part of the netherlands . 
  discovered in 1959 , it is the largest natural gas field in europe and the tenth-largest in the world . 
   ...  after demonstrations in groningen because of the increase in induced earthquakes , whose event count shows an exponential growth in time , the dutch government decided on january 17 , 2014 to cut output from the gas field [ wikipedia , groningen gas field ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groningen_gas_field ) the [ gas fields that russia has ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_natural_gas_fields ) seem to technically not be in europe , but in the ural federal district , part of asia ? 
  at least we have more pinautomaten than finland . 
  i 'm quite surprised by the low number though . 
  having 414 per 1 million would mean we would only have around 414 * 17 = 7038 of them in our country ? 
  i live in a bigger city , so i guess that might affect my perception . 
  i was only stating that people might have concerns , as crime can be a factor , even if it does n't make sense now in regards to schengen due to criminals apparently already making use of freedom of movement . 
  frankly , with the disappearance of border checks , all i would like to see is countries , including romania , working together more closely and effectively on combating such crime . 
  perhaps you have more up-to-date information , but the reasoning i could find for the delay on bulgarian and romanian accession to the schengen zone was precisely due to that :  the netherlands has previously voted to delay the accession of bulgaria and romania to schengen , arguing that both countries need to step up measures against corruption and organised crime . 
  [ bbc , germany mulls schengen veto on bulgaria and romania ( 04-03-13 ) ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21653092 ) tax evasion is an entirely different topic . 
  i think we both can agree on it being bad and that it should be dealt with . 
  yeah , it definitely is interesting . 
  is there a breakdown for czech homicides too ? 
  i made a quick list of the available statistics we have in which ways people died here due to intentional homicide . 
  [ cbs , murder and manslaughter ( 2015 ) ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=81453ned&amp;d1=0,2-6&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=l&amp;hdr=g1,t&amp;stb=g2,g3&amp;vw=t ) type | amount | amount ( % ) -- | -- | -- total | 120 | 100 % | knife or melee | 49 | 40.8 % firearm | 41 | 34.2 % strangulation | 13 | 10.8 % hitting or kicking | 13 | 10.8 % other or unknown | 4 | 3.3 %, 
  i just knew it would be this video , haha . 
  i love [ the one with sound ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px_m6wes8gy ) though . 
   being out of schengen does n't block that , as you should already know . 
  well , the argument is invalid too , because they have already arrived unfortunately . 
  half of pickpockets in the netherlands unfortunately hold romanian nationality ( 40 % ) and a little under a fifth hold bulgarian nationality ( 16 % ) . 
  most of them also do not even live here .

  to add to that , poland and the netherlands both have a low murder rate that 's at around 0.7 per 100.000 . 
  what could be interesting is to look at gun related deaths among european countries . 
  the orlando terrorist , omar mateen , purchased his sig sauer mcx legally . 
  killed 49 , wounded 53 ? 
  anything involving their constitution -- if you 're speaking about the u.s. -- is sacred and divine . 
  no matter if they thought of it when muskets were still a thing . 
   neither are guns , ** most guns are made for hunting ** and target shooting , ** absolutely not for killing ** . 
  how do you hunt with a gun if you do n't kill the animal ? 
  humans are of course also animals . 
  i quickly looked at wikipedia regarding gun restrictions , but how difficult is it to obtain an a-license ? 
  it seems to grant one access to military and fully automatic firearms . 
  hmmm , that 1,95 per 100k for belgium is from the [ united nations office on drugs and crime ( unodc ) report ] ( http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_global_homicide_book_web.pdf ) , which is listed on wikipedia ? 
  i wonder what method they used to arrive at that number ? 
  looking at the official crime statistics for belgium , including 2015 and 2016 , i get a different number : * [ police federale , politi\u00eble criminaliteitsstatistieken , i. 3 .

  maar siktir lan is turks, 
  `` europe '' is too vague . 
  in the netherlands a lot of people do speak english , including minorities , yes . 
  i can understand being against uncontrolled migration , but our own society will change over time , albeit much slower , due to intra-eu migration . 
  are you against intra-eu migration too ?
