  the questionnaire they are speaking about in the video , i believe that was once posted here and everyone was able to fill it out because there was n't a captcha . 
  `` specxmen '' reminded me of the x-men . 
  i just imagine [ the tune playing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7izsgvxc_pm ) whenever he shows his id . 
  i honestly thought you were joking at first when you mentioned orb\u00e1n . 
   no , `` wow '' because the huge number of immigrants to poland to the netherlands you mean ? 
  i might have to edit this post if there 's a misunderstanding . 
  in 2015 22.851 that were born in poland ( country of origin ) moved to the netherlands and 9.572 ( polish ) left the netherlands . 
  yes , just to clarify , it is by `` land van herkomst '' or `` country of origin '' in english , so in the year 2015 22.851 people that were born in poland moved to the netherlands and 9.572 that were born in poland left . 
  then subtracting emigrants from immigrants gives us a positive net migration of 13.279 . , 
  i faintly remember reading something along those lines being incentivized , but not being enforced . 
  it seems there was some criticism towards our government for not doing enough . 
  here 's a bit on it that i quickly translated :  ** first migration wave , 1990 -- 1995 ** the first migration wave started once slovenia and croatia declared independence in 1991 . 
  around 80.000 yugoslavs ( predominantly croats , serbs and bosnians ) moved towards central , west - and northern-europe where they sought refuge mostly among family members that left before as guest workers . 
  this also was the case in the netherlands . 
  in the '60s and '70s many yugoslavs ( the ethnicity was n't registered at the time ) moved to the netherlands . 
  after that time family members joined due to the family reunification . 
  in 1990 there were around 20.000 yugoslavs in the netherlands . 
  the connections with the former guest workers in the new country made integration easier . 
  after 1992 many bosnians left the region due to the increasing violence . 
  around 1.2 million bosnians ( serbs , croats and muslims/bosniaks ) fled within the borders of ( former ) yugoslavia , while around 1.3 million left the country . 
  germany took in the most bosnians by far ( around 340.000 in 1997 ) . 
  the netherlands took in 25.000 bosnians . 
  public opinion in the netherlands changed strongly after footage of the detention camps in bosnia in 1992 was shown on television . 
  afterwards , the government announced it was willing to take in refugees . 
  around 3000 bosnians arrived after being invited by the dutch government . 
  in september of that year the first action took place and two dutch trains picked up around 1000 refugees from camps in croatia . 
  the majority of refugees , however , decided to make the trip on their own . 
   ** policy ** the first refugees at the start of the '90s arrived in the netherlands with a tourist visa and were allowed to stay . 
  from 1992 , the benelux introduced a visa requirement for bosnia , which made the arrival of refugees more difficult . 
  for asylum seekers from ( former ) yugoslavia there was a special arrangement . 
  they were designated as `` displaced persons '' and were not given the asylum seeker status . 
  this was due to the expectation that their stay would be temporary . 
  after 1993 the dutch government started processing requests for asylum from bosnian refugees . 
  most were given an `` a-status '' ( official admission as a refugee ) or a `` vvtv '' ( temporary residence permit ) . 
  following the dayton accords in 1995 , the number of new asylum requests decreased and the admission policy was tightened . 
  [ centrum voor de geschiedenis van migranten ( center for the history of migrants ) , vluchtelingen uit voormalig joegoslavi\u00eb ( refugees from former yugoslavia ) ] ( http://www.vijfeeuwenmigratie.nl/term/vluchtelingen%20uit%20voormalig%20joegoslavi%c3%ab/volledige-tekst ) there 's this other article from 1996 that briefly speaks about some of the things you mentioned :  germany , as the only european country , has not committed itself to the prerequisites laid out by the [ united nations ' high commissioner for refugees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_high_commissioner_for_refugees ) . 
  the country wanted to send back those from former yugoslavia next spring , but has pushed that date back to the 1st of october . 
  i am assuming most were able to stay , as they 're one of our larger minority groups at [ 84.243 in 2016 ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=37325&amp;d1=0&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=0,2,103&amp;d6=0,4,8,12,16,l&amp;hdr=g5&amp;stb=g1,g2,g3,g4,t&amp;vw=t ) . 
   `` we have repeatedly said russia is not present on the territory of donbass , '' only `` miners '' , yes , with an infinite amount of advanced military hardware . 
  i 'm reminded of simon ostrovsky 's coverage on this , it was pretty interesting : * [ selfie soldiers : russia checks in to ukraine ( 23:13 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zssifn2mso ), 
  indeed . 
  seems a common foreign policy makes the nordic countries flaccid . 
  that 's all that i was saying , i thought a similar case of former refugees here would contribute to the discussion . 
  it was n't meant to be malicious/xenophobic . 
   you 're assuming they 're all lazy but forget to consider that many employers simply refuse to hire them because of their origins . 
  i said no such thing , neither did i assume anything . 
  i do not like that you accuse me of doing so and immediately downvote . 
  i do n't know what the reality was , only that people were n't employed from the get-go and that it took time . 
  yeah , there was a thread on refugees in / r/thenetherlands a while ago and it mentioned an interesting bit of information on european refugees from the '90s . 
   ** english ** the poor employment rate for refugees are not an incident . 
  from the group that received a residence permit between 1995 and 1999 , mostly people from former yugoslavia , only a third of them had a job of 30 hours or more after 15 years . 
  frankly , people have been fooling themselves by thinking this would be easy or that it would be economically beneficial . 
  it never seems to have been the case . 
  :-)  it 's not like the immigration is the only problem point between gl and cda , but yeah , we 'd probably already be halfway there now ... yeah , i agree . 
  i have no idea what will happen now or which other party ( parties ? ), 
  are going to fill in that gap . 
  in case you are legitimately interested , it 's mostly sharp increases in theft upon accession . 
  it 's pretty self-explanatory that criminals tend to flock to places where riches are to be found . 
  our central bureau of statistics does note that nationals of these countries are usually `` specialized '' in certain types of crime .

   should n't he ... try to find some dutch friends first ? 
  haha , yeah it 's not that odd if we look at the time it took for past cabinets to form . 
  the thing they ca n't agree on is the contentious topic that is migration . 
  i think we 'd already be done if we did n't have to agree on that do n't you think ?

'', 
  there was a dutch article on this yesterday by our public broadcaster . 
  quick translation :  ** rutte in search of new european friends ** all kinds of changes today in the european union : brexit negotiations have started in brussels . 
  with the departure of great-britain from the european union and the deeper franco-german ties , it 's important for prime minister mark rutte to make new allies . 
   rutte did this today in warsaw , where he spoke with leaders from luxembourg , belgium and four eastern european countries : poland , hungary , czechia and slovakia . 
   `` we 're always busy to make sure that we work well together in europe . 
  and that we can ensure our own interests in that way '' , rutte explains . 
   rutte hopes that the eastern european countries will take over great-britain 's role . 
  because poland and hungary , like the british , are against more europe . 
  but will this new friendship then take aim at the major powers , germany and france , that do want to give brussels more power ? 
  `` no '' , says rutte . 
  `` but what is a problem in the eu 's balance , is that the voice of the united kingdom wo n't be there anymore . '', 
   ** distribution of refugees ** rutte criticizes hungary , czechia and poland , because they are not fulfilling the agreement on the redistribution of refugees across europe . 
  these countries refuse to take in asylum seekers from greece and italy . 
   `` you ca n't say , as eastern europe : we will not participate in the fair distribution of refugees in europe . 
  they are barely doing anything , and we have spoken to them about that . '', 
   rutte also criticizes the policy of the ruling polish party that has affected the media 's ability to be independent and the rule of law . 
  in poland they want the government to be able to appoint judges . 
  according to rutte that is unacceptable in the european union . 
   they have a democratic constitutional state with a separation of powers , just like in the netherlands . 
  it 's important to prevent one of those powers to overpower the others . 
  it is a risk when your government interferes with the court system . 
   ** brexit negotiations ** meanwhile , in brussels , the brexit negotiations have started . 
  the netherlands will hold ` brexit-summits ' . 
  the future of the eu without the brits will be on the agenda . 
  when great-britain announced to leave the european union , prime minister mark rutte already mentioned that we would have to find new partners we can work with . 
   ** contacts ** the netherlands hopes , with the benelux , to be able to have a central role in europe . 
  the belgians traditionally have a good relationship with paris and the netherlands can work reasonably well with berlin . 
  but the germans also seem to be becoming part of the problem . 
   chancellor angela merkel , together with french president emmanuel macron , wants to lead the new europe . 
  even if only to prevent old sentiments towards germany -- in which it imposes its will on other countries -- from appearing once again . 
  does n't help your average joe . 
  furthermore , crime has also gone up , so it 's not all sunshine and rainbows . 
  just for your interest , but this cheap labor you speak off fuels right-wing ( anti-immigrant ) parties in the u.k. and in the netherlands . 
  also , countries that entered the eu in 2004 and 2007 were not immediately allowed to work here without any restrictions , so it 's not as if our government is _ that _ fond of cheap labor . 
  although not `` terrorism '' , it reminds me of these two poles that were trying to extort ikea by detonating explosives in their stores .
