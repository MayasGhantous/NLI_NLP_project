  i know it sounds incredibly whacky , but [ here 's an article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-15228238 ) on it by the bbc . 
   polish authorities have arrested and charged two suspects over a series of bomb attacks on ikea furniture stores across five eu states . 
   the men , named only as adam k and mikolaj g , both 39 , were arrested over attacks in belgium , france , the czech republic , the netherlands and germany . 
   they are suspected of seeking to extort 6m euros ( # 5.1 m ; $ 8.1 m ) from ikea . 
  indeed . 
  do take into consideration that the molotov cocktail was thrown at a mosque with a lot of people in it , including children . 
  as much as i dislike the russian government , i think that was a mistake , one the russian government is not willing to admit to . 
  consider that a ukrainian [ antonov 26 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/antonov.an26.fairford.arp.jpg/1200px-antonov.an26.fairford.arp.jpg ) transport plane [ was shot down days before mh17 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28299334 ) at an altitude of 6500 meters , while mh17 was shot down on the 17th of july . 
  i ca n't imagine russia opting to shoot down a civilian airliner on purpose . 
  i think they mistook it for a ukrainian plane , somehow . 
  i was interested in arrests per 100,000 .

  grozny , chechnya and slavyansk , ukraine after capture and liberation respectively is what it says , right ? 
  cool !, 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  wow , that 's nuts from my perspective !, 
  it was a historical photo i assume , not one that supports nazism ? 
  i did n't know this was a thing in russia ? 
  is this really a thing ? 
   many of them will also refuse to integrate into the host society , they will refuse to relinquish their oppressive islamic beliefs , ** they will refuse to return to their homeland ** , and they will push for their own radical islamist ideals to be implemented into law . 
  this is not really true though , we of course [ have statistics on migration ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=60032&amp;d1=2&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=141,226&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=a&amp;hdr=g4&amp;stb=g1,g2,t,g3&amp;vw=g ) and in recent years turks have actually been emigrating . 
  the same applies to moroccans . 
  year | immigration | emigration | net migration -- | -- | -- | -- 2015 | 7409 | 5463 | 1946 2014 | 4924 | 6428 | -1504 2013 | 4269 | 5165 | -896 2012 | 4107 | 4011 | 96 2011 | 4254 | 3338 | 916 2010 | 4706 | 2607 | 2099  as for this being a baseless accusation , that simply is n't the case . 
  this does n't make sense to me . 
  these terror attacks do not help parties in power . 
  in fact , it 's the opposite , people have shown that they will lean more towards and vote on parties that promise radical changes . 
   and frankly , i do n't like your tone . 
  it 's possible to disagree with someone without attacking them personally i did n't attack you personally . 
  all i said was `` yeah , no '' , which was dismissive of me , yes , but a personal attack ? 
  relax , i 'm not downvoting you , i simply disagree with your points . 
  have a good night regardless , that 's sincere . 
  you should n't look at our country as a business , it does n't do us any good to bring in more people that will simply strain the welfare system . 
  if we 're going to look at our country as a business , a more apt analogy would be to hire extra people for your business while not having any vacant positions . 
   excuse me ... ? 
  snottiness is not a valid rebuttal to anything . 
  you 're not being clever , you 're being immature . 
  you need to grow up . 
  i ca n't take a baseless accusation seriously . 
  you 're saying our politicians support terrorism in order to win political points . 
  it 's a very big claim and one i find absurd . 
  even if ( ! ), 
  so , they 're doing one awful job at it !, 
  our last terror attack was theo van gogh 's assassination in 2004 . 
   1 ) cheap labor . 
  native europeans have become accustomed to decent wages and benefits . 
  third world migrants can be underpaid and overworked . 
  we already had an enormous amount of intra-eu migration . 
  there really is no need for more people . 
   2 ) the formation of parallel societies , `` ghettos . '', 
  if you have large ghettos filled with foreigners , it gives you more leverage to alienate your own people , because you can still pander to the foreigners for votes . 
  makes no sense , a right-wing party has been in charge that does n't pander to foreigners for votes at all . 
  the opposite actually . 
  foreigners in the netherlands are more likely to vote for the labor party . 
   3 ) terrorism . 
  they want controllable amounts of jihadi terrorism to keep people scared . 
  they want a few people to be hacked apart with machetes or crushed under a truck every now and then , so they can use that fear to strip away the civil liberties of their citizens , piece by piece until none of those liberties remain . 
  yeah , no . 
   the younger population in their 20 's are all getting the fuck out of here . 
  literally in masses . 
  there 's an exodus to nl and germany . 
  that 's interesting , i looked at immigration and emigration for italians in the netherlands and it gave me the following : [ ** italy ** ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=60032&amp;d1=a&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=106&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=a&amp;hdr=g4&amp;stb=g1,g2,t,g3&amp;vw=t ) year | immigration | emigration | net migration | -- | -- | -- | -- 1995 | 1361 | 1101 | 260 2000 | 1897 | 1110 | 787 2005 | 1717 | 1222 | 495 2010 | 3271 | 1550 | 1721 2015 | 5932 | 2726 | 3206 i was interested in looking at other european countries , so here are some more : [ ** spain ** ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=60032&amp;d1=a&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=209&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=a&amp;hdr=g4&amp;stb=g1,g2,t,g3&amp;charttype=1&amp;vw=t ) year | immigration | emigration | net migration | -- | -- | -- | -- 1995 | 1784 | 2243 | -459 2000 | 2638 | 2867 | -229 2005 | 2885 | 4131 | -1246 2010 | 6109 | 3532 | 2577 2015 | 7188 | 5568 | 1620 [ ** poland ** ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=60032&amp;d1=a&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=181&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=a&amp;hdr=g4&amp;stb=g1,g2,t,g3&amp;charttype=1&amp;vw=t ) year | immigration | emigration | net migration | -- | -- | -- | -- 1995 | 1236 | 454 | 782 2000 | 1884 | 598 | 1286 2005 | 6672 | 1001 | 5671 2010 | 14782 | 3589 | 11193 2015 | 22851 | 9572 | 13279, 
  also you !, 
  including everybody :-) okay , everybody , including everybody ... please go back !, 
  beautiful !, 
  he sounds excited though , haha . 
   did i claim there was a majority-held sentiment like this you said  the very real racist sentiment on the left . 
  if it 's not a sentiment held by a significant amount of people , why even mention it ? 
  you 're shifting the goalposts here . 
  if you 're telling me our greenleft ( groenlinks ) , labor party ( pvda ) and socialist party ( sp ) have such sentiments when it comes to racism , then this is not true . 
  in fact , i have never heard of it , unlike the statements from a right-wing party recently . 
  it 's safe to say that everyone has noticed the presence and racism of the `` alt-right '' on reddit and many other places as / u/logatz noted , so i 'm not sure what you 're getting at . 
  i have no idea what happened at [ 50:55 ] ( https://youtu.be/g-xoejb4leu?t=3054 ) . 
  the odd music ( sounds like a funeral ) , combined with a weird speech and some lovely dunglish left me feeling confused . 
  i wonder to what extent and how soon these advances will affect truck drivers though . 
  most of them are homegrown , no ? 
  there is no such sentiment in the netherlands , and i doubt there is such a sentiment in bulgaria of all places . 
  get over it already . 
  some people post racist stuff , but that 's not the view the majority holds obviously . 
  i get quite some racist messages aimed at me personally from trumpets on / r/europe , e.g. 
   / u/caseycaner hey clnyze19n , why do you think there are so many dumb disgusting coalburners like your mother that fetishize nigger dick out there ? 
  i wonder what its like to be the son of a white racetraitor whore . 
  i bet you look nothing like her, 
  first thing i end up looking at ... 
   there ca n't be any change for the better if people are afraid to tell it as it is because it might hurt some feelings . 
  they now apparently have a job , so why insult them by sarcastically mentioning they 'll be as `` hardworking '' as gypsies -- which are generally seen as non-productive ? 
  i do n't see how a stinky friend is relevant to this . 
  they were . 
  why are you lying to yourself ? 
  does that make you feel better ? 
  * [ problems with poles ? 
  report them to us , says new pvv website ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/02/problems_with_poles_report_the/ )  pvv parliamentarian ino van de besselaar told the ad the aim of the site is to develop proper insight into the ** ` problems caused by central and eastern europeans in terms of crime , alcoholism , drugs use , dumping household waste and prostitution ' . 
  there are many more parties in syria with completely different goals when compared to wwii . 
  i really do n't blame them for not wanting to join the civil war . 
   i think 1-2 of them even got jobs . 
  oh , something positive . 
   a few more generations and they might even be as hardworking as our gypsies . 
  why turn it into something negative ? 
  i 'm sure you would n't like hearing a dutch person saying that about romanians ? 
  [ in light of past governments ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/historisch_overzicht_van_kabinetsformaties_in_nederland ) it 's not that odd , especially when we consider that _ migration _ is the thing they supposedly ca n't agree on : year | cabinet | days required -- | -- | -- 2002 | balkenende i | 68 2003 | balkenende ii | 125 2006 | balkenende iii | 8 2006-2007 | balkenende iv | 90 2010 | rutte i | 127 2012 | rutte ii | 54 currently we 're at 90 days or so , i think . 
  i agree on baudet , and many of the points are quite ambiguous , but i think that some , when applied to the netherlands , that fall flat are :  * people are generally expected to pick a side and join the jedi or the sith .
