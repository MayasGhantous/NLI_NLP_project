  no other way . 
  i disagree on politics being as polarized here as in many other european countries . 
  our political spectrum has many more hues when compared to other countries . 
  continuing that analogy , one could say we have many more viable options here such as : * ewoks ( partij voor de dieren ) * wookies ( groenlinks ) * galactic senate ( vvd ) * galactic empire ( pvv ) * first order ( fvd ) * rebel alliance ( sp ) * gungans ( denk ) ... and so on . 
   * if you criticise the government , present proof that you 've criticised the previous ones for the same things in the same situations . 
  criticizing whoever 's governing seems to almost be our national pastime -- without even that much backlash , regardless of political affiliation in my experience . 
   i think with enough time we can make them integrated with us . 
  as cruel as it sounds , you mean once the previous generation will pass away ? 
  from what i understand , there 's quite a divide between the older and younger generation . 
  even then , i do n't ever see them giving up their gbp . 
  i really would n't associate most of those with our politics , especially the hyperbole part regarding the usage of words such as `` fascist '' , `` totalitarian '' and so on . 
  to be honest , i already find british politics to be wildly different from ours . 
  oh , thanks !, 
  i have been on tele2 myself for a couple of years now . 
  i saw that offer [ a couple of days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gj26i/as_a_citizen_of_the_european_union_the/diqvhyk/?context=3 ) too !, 
  might switch to it when the need arises . 
  huh , tele2 , new ? 
  they 've been here for more than a decade , no ? 
  on mobile , but [ pakistan actually had a spy here ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4135998.stm ) i think . 
  yeah , unfortunately . 
  i 've gotten quite some racist messages due to my mixed ancestry . 
  it 's mostly from trumpets that do n't even live here though . 
  i would n't take it too hard . 
  this sub is all over the place at times . 
  it 's obviously an absurd comment . 
  i doubt germany would be bulgaria 's top trading partner when it comes to their exports , if it was their intent to destabilize . 
  edit : wow !, 
  we 've gone too far down the comment chain . 
  it 's where strange things tend to happen . 
  we do n't have `` gypsies '' , as your gypsy citizens usually are n't our citizens . 
  they hold romanian nationality and are yours . 
  you whine about `` foreigners bringing crime '' , yet when _ your _ nationals commit crime abroad it suddenly is not a problem . 
  hypocrisy at its best . 
  crime ? 
  you do realize romanian nationals ( you will of course call them gypsies -- as if that matters ) are responsible for 40 % of pickpocketing in the netherlands ? 
  that 's where you 're wrong , kiddo . 
   nyc based golden dawn office sounds like a place you 'd get funky coffee at . 
   the netherlands also has n't suffered any terrorist attacks theo van gogh ( 2004 ) ? 
  in general , we are way below the radar from what it looks like though , so i 'm not complaining , let 's keep it that way . 
  interesting !, 
  thanks for the find . 
  i indeed found the ` emojionemozilla.ttf ` font in my firefox install directory , but the reason it is not applied in windows 10 -- which has no support for emoji flags -- can be found in one of the release notes for firefox :  [ added a built-in emoji set for operating systems without native emoji fonts ( windows 8.0 and lower and linux ) ] ( https://www.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/50.0a2/releasenotes/ ), 
  i think he might be talking about [ these differences ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5f6261/comparing_mobile_data_prices_and_limitations_in/ ) ? 
  edit : i 'm not sure how accurate the above still is , [ tele2 seems to be offering ] ( https://www.tele2.nl/mobiel/sim-only/ ) unlimited calling , sms and data for $ 25 now ? 
  that 's below $ 30 obviously . 
  hmmm , odd . 
  which os are you currently on ? 
  i do n't think the windows version i 'm on supports them . 
  i 'm running the firefox developer build and chrome canary too . 
  mobile , they 're just emoji , e.g. 
  i do not like their government -- and that 's an understatement . 
  that does n't mean i ca n't feel sorry for the people . 
  well , to state whether someone 's presence is a plus or a minus is a subjective thing as we are talking about people . 
  regardless , they have had a tremendous impact on our music , food and many other aspects . 
  many here will know who paul elstak is , he has indonesian ancestry for example . 
  many people will also be familiar with jesse klaver and geert wilders , they also have indonesian ancestry . 
  regarding crime , they actually [ rank a tiny bit better ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=81959ned&amp;d1=2,5&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=1-4,32&amp;d5=0&amp;d6=15&amp;hdr=g5,g2,g1,g4,t&amp;stb=g3&amp;vw=t ) than natives , which i thought was interesting . 
  indeed !, 
  now i do wonder though if germans and french would be willing to learn dutch ? 
  i guess it 's time to hook him up then . 
  it looks like the world has found clean and infinite forms of energy after all . 
  what does ridf mean ? 
  well look at that !, 
  that 's beyond cool , made me smile . 
  hopefully the benelux can be part of that too !, 
   `` germany and france want to become the motor of a european defense union and implement the defense fund in a smart way , '' von der leyen said . 
  it sounds great , but i wonder where this cooperation will ultimately lead to . 
  i can imagine some of these changes might be very sensitive/difficult . 
  for example , does that mean france -- hypothetically speaking -- would have to give up on its leclerc tank in the future in order to improve interoperability between germany and france and save on duplicated hardware ? 
  would they dare to make that step is more or less my question . 
  i somehow doubt the russian population had much of a ( democratic ) say in the policies of let 's say stalin ? 
  i do feel sorry for russians . 
  so much wealth in resources , but barely any of that flows back to its population ? 
  feel free to correct or add to if i 'm wrong . 
   no one here gives a fuck about from where an immigrant comes as long as they respect the culture not really . 
  i received multiple threats today and even just a moment ago in my inbox for even mentioning on / r/europe that i have african-american and dutch heritage . 
  the internet of course -- fortunately -- is a different place , but still . 
  for those interested , here are some of the messages :  / u/lasule20 : are scum in th enetherlands too . 
  ure inferior primitive violent beasts . 
  pissss on you and on your entire race . 
  go back to africa u inferior creature  / u/caseycaner : hey clnyze19n , why do you think there are so many dumb disgusting coalburners like your mother that fetishize nigger dick out there ? 
  i wonder what its like to be the son of a white racetraitor whore . 
  i bet you look nothing like her, 
   in 2013 stabbed a finnish author at the signing of a book about the far-right _ i do n't like what you 're saying/writing about my ideology , thus i will physically hurt you . _ where have i heard that one before . 
  [ well , he was fond of polish laborers . 
  ] ( http://time.com/4465744/donald-trump-undocumented-workers/ )  in the summer of 1980 , donald trump faced a big problem . 
  for six months , undocumented polish laborers had been clearing the future site of trump tower , his signature real estate project on manhattan 's fifth avenue , where he now lives , maintains his private offices and hosts his presidential campaign . 
   the men were putting in 12-hour shifts with inadequate safety equipment at subpar wages that their contractor paid sporadically , if at all . 
  a lawyer for many of the poles demanded that the workers be paid or else he would serve trump with a lien on the property . 
  one polish worker even went to trump 's office to ask him for money in person , according to sworn testimony and a deposition filed under oath in a court case . 
  that 's basically my point . 
  i advocated for controlled immigration . 
  i do n't really get your attitude and the personal attack . 
  furthermore , quite a chunk of them are enrolled in schools in the u.s. and have been born in the u.s. if you looked at the statistics i posted . 
  ask any other dutch person whether they have problems with indonesians -- i 've _ never _ heard of it . 
  dutch history is intertwined with indonesia and one of the reasons our country has prospered in the past . 
   you could , but there 's this pesky thing the west values called `` human rights '' , which will prevent anything like this from happening . 
  right , seems some serbs in the '90s forgot about those human rights . 
  i 'd rather not forget about them . 
  you 're basically justifying it even , wow .
