  i 'm not sure how we could deduce where _ all _ nigerian-americans have been educated . 
  the statistics i posted list school enrollment , and whether they were born abroad or in the united states . 
  in case you 'd figure it out , i 'd like to know . 
  i actually looked at the u.s. census data ( american community survey , 2015 ) which might be interesting . 
  please do a double check , if you think it 's off . 
  ** educational attainment ( 2015 , 25 years and over ) ** | ancestry | population | less than high school diploma | high school graduate ( includes equivalency ) | some college or associate 's degree | bachelor 's degree | graduate or professional degree -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | japanese | 1411188 | 4.0 % | 18.3 % | 28.4 % | 32.7 % | 16.5 % | nigerian | 390255 | 4.3 % | 11.4 % | 25.0 % | 30.0 % | 29.3 % | asian indian | 3699957 | 7.9 % | 9.0 % | 9.7 % | 32.6 % | 40.8 % | chinese ( except taiwanese ) | 3973723 | 17.7 % | 14.5 % | 14.1 % | 26.6 % | 27.0 % | korean | 1822213 | 7.1 % | 17.5 % | 21.4 % | 34.1 % | 19.8 % | dutch | 4141375 | 6.9 % | 26.9 % | 32.5 % | 21.2 % | 12.5 % i found the data at the [ u.s. census bureau 's factfinder ] ( https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml ) , to view the data above i did the following : 1 . 
  click _ `` advanced search '' _ 1 . 
  add the topic _ `` american community survey '' _ 1 . 
  add the topic _ `` 2015 '' _ for the latest data 1 . 
  click the _ `` race and ethnic groups '' _ , button on the left , then click on _ `` detailed groups '' _ and search for japanese or any other group . 
  my father is actually african-american and was stationed here in the '90s . 
  my mom is dutch . 
  you do n't have to scream . 
  scrolling through this thread as a dutch black guy . 
  ( \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u00b0 ) there 's obviously nothing wrong with sensible immigration policy and adequate border protection , but some of the comments here ... 
  unfortunately , yes . 
  another conspiracy theory that someone tried to tell me about was that mh17 and the aircraft that went missing before , mh370 , were somehow switched . 
  some minds truly go to great lengths . 
  it 's the entire schtick of russia today & co. 
  spread as many stupid theories as you can find , hoping some will stick . 
  [ yes , seeing the entire plane being put together and having a cockpit with holes all over the place from high-velocity shrapnel is `` not convincing '' ] ( https://youtu.be/igm00tdqiry?t=451 )  in a hanger , pieces of the airplane were laid out for investigation . 
  all wreckage pieces were examined for ** failure mechanisms , damage patterns and traces of external objects ** that could have hit the airplane . 
   the investigation of the wreckage led to further evidence of a surface-to-air missile being the cause of the crash of flight mh17 . 
  a number of other scenarios such as : ** internal explosions , gunfire or air-to-air missiles were excluded . 
  ** instead , the theory propped up by russia 's ministry of defence is a lot more believable , where a ukrainian su-25 climbed to 10 kilometer and shot mh17 from behind . 
  [ they ** did ** consider other options ] ( https://youtu.be/igm00tdqiry?t=350 ), 
  i linked to an article concerning that [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6g1y79/20_eu_nations_back_plan_for_eu_prosecutors_office/dinw1du/ ) . 
  we unfortunately have been ignoring this a bit before the election . 
  i remember a romanian once mentioning it and it surprised me because i had never heard of it .

   the advantage today is that green technology is advanced enough so countries can invest directly into that instead of going through the regular phase of coal power and then green energy . 
  is n't this what happened in romania and its internet infrastructure ? 
  oh wow , i would not want to be on that rollercoaster if it would n't be able to brake . 
  yeah , what about a soviet union 2.0 ? 
  are you not ashamed of yourself when you post such things ? 
  can you not even slightly empathize considering your country 's history ? 
  i do n't think you can just lump over 1 billion and over 50 countries together like that ? 
  i thought most syrians came from turkey and it 's mostly people from the african continent that travel by the mediterranean ? 
  i did n't downvote you , but i do n't know . 
  do you have any link to that ? 
  i do n't think he was that outspoken on the issue , but i might be wrong . 
  out of spite we should call it something else , perhaps the czech cheque or dough from oslo . 
  seeing our fellow countrymen [ arrive back home ] ( https://youtu.be/7wdn-pjiryk?t=122 ) was a very surreal thing to see . 
  i 'm not even sure what would come from this new material . 
  i do n't see russia recognizing their wrongs in the near future , because their government lacks decency . 
  [ here 's an in-depth video from the dutch safety board on what happened . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdileyt9spi ), 
   the aforementioned plan is called `` berlin plus '' - but the money for its implementation should , among other sources , come from the european economic area ( eea ) consisting of all eu member states , iceland , liechtenstein and norway , as well as the european free trade association ( efta ) , where switzerland is also a member . 
  why is it called berlin plus when the money will come from the eea ? 
  i assume it is the assigned temporary name until approval ? 
  i actually like [ this one ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/aa/a8/49/aaa849ba0699a24ea8dc45025ea2fd03.jpg ) , except for the shape of the minaret , it stands out too much in my opinion . 
  the one / u/kulinban linked to looks nice . 
  it would be a great workout for your calves !, 
   i do n't know poland 's demographics so i ca n't say how many moroccans and turks are living there . 
  yeah , i do n't speak polish and was interested in the numbers , but if [ this page ( p. 98 ) ] ( http://stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/lud_ludnosc_stan_str_dem_spo_nsp2011.pdf ) in their 2011 census means what i think it means , they might have about 1000 turks by now ? 
  if a polish person could check , that 'd be great . 
  it 's is about 0.2 % compared to our demographics . 
  i ca n't find anything resembling moroccan , so i doubt there even are any there . 
  our last terror attack ( theo van gogh ) was in 2004 -- or 13 years ago . 
  beyond some arrests , not much has happened here to my knowledge , while we have 300.000 moroccans and 400.000 turks . 
   eu states should just up their defense contribution and leadership inside nato . 
  barely any party here seems to be interested in hitting 2 % by 2024 . 
  i looked at it and it looks like this is just not going to happen , at least here . 
  here are the increases the biggest parties that won the recent election want to make for the next 4 years : party | increase in military expenditure ( billions of eur ) | military expenditure as % of gdp -- | -- | -- gl ( greenleft ) | 0 | 1.17 % d66 ( democrats ' 66 ) | 0,5 | 1.24 % vvd ( people 's party for freedom and democracy ) | 1 | 1.31 % cda ( christian democratic appeal ) | 2,1 | 1.48 % * [ nato , defence expenditures of nato countries ( 2009-2016 ) ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_07/20160704_160704-pr2016-116.pdf ) * [ trouw , bij vrijwel alle politieke partijen staat defensie weer in de gunst ] ( https://www.trouw.nl/home/bij-vrijwel-alle-politieke-partijen-staat-defensie-weer-in-de-gunst~a903777f/ ) * [ het financieele dagblad , cpb-doorrekening : partijen laten het geld weer rollen ] ( https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewj6hspbn6nuahvqavakhfdbd4uqfgg2mai&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2ffd.nl%2feconomie-politiek%2f1187905%2fcpb-doorrekening-partijen-laten-het-geld-weer-rollen&amp;usg=afqjcnh3mybmhblvzr00hpu9obwnujkklq ) makes me wonder what on earth it is that they want . 
  sooner or later they 'll either have to state that they want to spend `` even '' more on our military or that we 'll have to look for something else . 
  [ is n't that already a thing ? 
  ] ( https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/agencies/eda_en )  ** european defence agency **  1 . improve the eu 's defence capabilities especially in the field of crisis management ; 1 . 
  ** promote eu armaments cooperation ** ; 1 . strengthen the eu defence industrial and technological base and create a competitive european defence equipment market ; 1 . promote research , with a view to strengthening europe 's industrial and technological potential in the defence field . 
   ...  the agency 's `` comparative advantage '' is its ability to deal with all these agendas , and relate them so as to realise their synergies . 
  although from what it sounds like it has probably been neutered . 
  is that a clapping gorilla on the left ? 
  looks amazing !, 
  i 'd love to have some mountains as someone who lives in the netherlands . 
  living on one of those mountains must be amazing . 
  i think italy and greece have had to deal with this for many years before when those boats were n't really around and they also drowned ? 
  we 're only interested in it now because it 's not just affecting greece and italy , but many more members in the eu . 
  [ reminds me of this guy explaining what happened ] ( http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/7152315/1a15bea8/zo_schoot_die_politie.html ), 
   i found out that it actually is what you guys call a quarter pounder with cheese . 
  royal k\u00e4se , le royal cheese , but we went for quarter pounder in the netherlands . 
   there are issues with the some of the roma population `` issues '' is quite an understatement . 
  that 's funny , [ because we had an american ask for the sauce ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/6ewn75/how_to_buy_or_make_the_mcdonalds_fritessaus_they/ ) used in the dutch mcdonald 's over at / r/thenetherlands :-),

  [ i am quite aware of that ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5o9kbm/schiphol_airport_calls_for_greater_security_due/dci1v29/ ) , but at the time i did n't feel it was appropiate to post here . 
   population of eastern europe ( including poland , czech republic etc. ), 
  is around around 300 million . 
  not just that , he 's also including russia ( 144.1 million ) , ukraine ( 45.2 million ) and others which ca n't just pack their stuff and move or work in germany , even if they wanted to . 
  i have experienced how difficult it is in the netherlands for someone from croatia to move here , even when they wanted to and had their master 's . 
  we 're not going to compare the u.k. to iraq , nigeria , afghanistan or syria are we ? 
  we 're part of western-europe too you know . 
  i 'm reminded of [ this album ] ( http://imgur.com/a/yexrp#d2istzz ) someone once posted . 
  ca n't see people dressing up like that here . 
  oh , that 's not what i was insinuating , i just thought it was peculiar , having '' [ cat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/avpfndg.jpg ) '' as a top-level domain . 
   am i to understand that you support how your money is spent at the moment ? 
  honestly , he has a point , greek/portugal/italy / spain problem is far more important than spending billions on `` refugees '' from bangladesh . 
  no , and i ca n't think of many people that are thrilled about the idea of spending money on refugees , but regardless frans timmermans his numbers do not concern people that are actually granted asylum and our news agency actually commented on them being kind of iffy : * dutch : [ nos , goochelt frans timmermans met cijfers ?
