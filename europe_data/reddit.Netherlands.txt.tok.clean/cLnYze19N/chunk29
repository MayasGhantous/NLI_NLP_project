  why are you even writing in a public forum if you do not wish to discuss things with foreign people ? 
  sure , just because someone has a certain nationality does n't invalidate their point , but it 's pretty rich for someone on the other side of the atlantic , whose government played a major role in this whole mess , unless he 's from canada or mexico , to lecture the netherlands on what we should spend money on . 
  how about the united states takes in some of these people . 
  that is distasteful . 
   greek/portugal/italy / spain paying for these countries solves nothing , it is akin to ukraine . 
  i believe these problems are inherent to how they are currently structured . 
  i 'm fine with helping solving corruption and other tools we could perhaps work on together , but letting the problems just fester on like an open wound while only throwing money at it seems pointless to me . 
   does your government or the government of poland encourage slavery ? 
  either you have terrible reading comprehension or you 're purposefully setting up straw man arguments . 
  i never argued a government should _ encourage _ that . 
  i said that it should recognize that those that committed a crime are _ their _ nationals and not some kind of group that does n't belong there . 
  to put quotes around `` polish '' every time this happens is absurd . 
  it 's obviously a huge problem looking at our statistics and having the bbc write `` gypsies '' is not going to magically lower crime in western-europe or increase support for further expansion of the european union in the western balkans . 
  there are quite some candidate countries in that area , such as serbia , with a significant amount of gypsies , who according to this thread are responsible for 99.99 % of crime . 
   but it should be noted that much of those emissions are a result of european and american industries outsourcing their production to china . 
  i 'm open to someone proving me wrong , but an economy primarily based on manufacturing seems to me that it would emit more co2 than one based on services . 
  some people seem to want to accept the `` they took our jobs ! '', 
  bit , but leave out the `` they took our co2 ! '', 
  that should follow it ? 
  your post makes no sense . 
  we 're speaking about crime and how it 's reported on as that is relevant to the thread . 
  if turks from the netherlands commit crimes in poland , then yes , those are our citizens and we should accept responsibility . 
  simply saying `` oh , they 're not _ really _ dutch '' is trying to absolve yourself of any blame . 
  this is exactly why wilders gains in popularity and why people are anti-eu . 
  barely anyone here wants serbia for example to join , as we 'll just get another wave of increased crime . 
  whether those would be gypsies does n't matter , they 're from that country and the only tool we could use to stop it from happening is to close our border . 
  how is what erdogan says even relevant to this ? 
  and coming from germany you have no room to talk . 
   wanting press to deliver an important bit of information is begging for discrimination ? 
  that does n't help us at all . 
  the only thing that would prevent crimes of type _ x _ would be for us to close the borders to those of nationality _ y _ that are overrepresented in those statistics . 
  personally i 'm not in favor of that at all and that obviously is difficult to do in the european union , so i 'd much rather see poland put in actual effort to deal with these people . 
  the only reason this information is important to you is so that your feelings are n't hurt , because from what i 'm reading it sounds like you 're ashamed these gypsies also have polish nationality and make you look bad and lower your chances of employment :  it 's the kind of information that would help a naive person turn down a great sounding job offer abroad and in turn potentially save a life or at least freedom . 
  thus you want news agencies such as the bbc to discriminate between `` good '' and `` bad '' polish while they both share the same nationality ? 
  it 's not fair if that 's the case , that 's all i 'm saying . 
  really ? 
  because i 'm pretty sure people , including you , have been putting `` polish '' between quotes all over this damn thread , as if they somehow do not belong to poland and come from gypsystan . 
  it 's your problem , thus you should deal with it . 
  for example , nowadays [ almost half ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2015/08/1-op-de-10-verdachten-van-misdrijf-is-buitenlander-zonder-vast-adres ) of pickpocketing comes from romanian nationals . 
  if crime from the netherlands flows into other countries , we should accept responsibility instead of trying to absolve ourselves from any blame by begging others to discriminate between dutch people based on ethnicity . 
  then it 's none of your damn business at all . 
  we could spend our tax money on snorting crushed tulips if we wanted to . 
  it 's not a charity and we already contribute the most per capita when it comes to the eu-budget . 
  then sort out your own internal problems with these gypsies instead of asking the world to bend over backwards to fix your problem . 
  you basically want us to discriminate between polish nationals , that is exactly what you 're asking . 
   i find this migrant crisis extremely distasteful for one reason . 
  prosperous european countries do n't want to subsidize struggling eurozone members , yet they are perfectly happy spending countless billions on economic migrants . 
  i find your comment distasteful . 
  how is what we , as a net contributor , spend our money on any of your business ? 
  it reeks of entitlement . 
  i 'm actually surprised that there is a ` . cat ` top-level domain and that catalonia owns it !, 
  the eulogy he gave was very powerful , although i do n't think i 'd be able to `` not give them my hatred . '', 
  i 'm not sure what the exact difficulties might be regarding posthumous marriage , but it 's good to see that the state could do this for him or at least not obstruct . 
  if someone from abroad commits a crime here , we will refer to them by their nationality . 
  i really do n't see what ethnicity has to do with it and why in god 's name we somehow should be obliged to include it just so people can feel better . 
  i was hoping that was the case , but alex epstein 's [ website ] ( http://industrialprogress.com/ ) , the _ `` center for industrial progress '' _ says the following :  for the last 40 years , so-called environmentalists have held back industrial progress around the world . 
  that 's why we 're helping industry fight for its freedom , with new ideas , arguments , and policies that will improve our economy and our environment . 
  they 're even handing out '' ** i love fossil fuels ** '' shirts and he has a book titled `` the moral case for fossil fuels . '', 
  if you 're interested in reading about straw man arguments , you might want to pick it up :-), 
  he 'd probably say we 're bullying the united states by applying pressure and then would end his tweet with one of the five adjectives he always goes for . 
  oh , yeah , especially this part killed me :  am i saying the more we have used fossil fuel the cleaner our water has become ? 
  and i thought he 'd say , `` no , but ... '' , but he just ends up saying the following with a straight face :  yes , that 's exactly what i 'm saying . 
   `` fuck a little '' - 112 millions ** who chose not to vote ** that is a complicated story in the united states . 
  i wish voting was as accessible to them as it is to us here in the netherlands . 
  it reminds me of [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjwq1fegpcw ) i saw today from prageru ... 
  it does n't change the fact that people apparently feel that bulgaria has become _ more _ corrupt from 2002 -- 2008 instead of the other way around according to transparency international 's global corruption report which / u/penki - linked to -- unless somalia is a shining beacon of honesty , full of law-abiding people according to those questioned . 
  if you clicked / u/penki - 's image you would see those _ are _ the numbers from transparency international . 
  it 's not a coincidence that bulgaria 's rank at 72 in 2008 lines up with the numbers i posted . 
  '' [ i love it when you call me big popa . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/phajxp_zmym?t=85 ) '' -- romania, 
  am i missing something , because a lower ranking is better , no ? 
  it went from 45 in 2002 to 72 in 2008 ? 
  [ corruption perceptions index 2008 ] ( https://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/cpi_2008/0/ ) country | rank -- | -- denmark | 1 bulgaria | 72 somalia | 180, 
  always reminds me of [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w58bpclegt4&amp;t=309 ) from austria at a dutch event .

   we might as well get rid of the european parliament , as their elections enjoy similar turnouts . 
  in case anyone wonders , [ here ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/en/turnout.html ) is the turnout for the 2014 election . 
  | country | turnout -- | -- | -- | belgium | 89.64 % | luxembourg | 85.55 % | malta | 74.80 % | greece | 59.97 % | italy | 57.22 % | denmark | 56.32 % | ireland | 52.44 % | sweden | 51.07 % | germany | 48.10 % | lithuania | 47.35 % | cyprus | 43.97 % | spain | 43.81 % | france | 42.43 % | finland | 39.10 % | the netherlands | 37.32 % | estonia | 36.52 % | bulgaria | 35.84 % | united kingdom | 35.60 % | portugal | 33.67 % | romania | 32.44 % | latvia | 30.24 % | hungary | 28.97 % | croatia | 25.24 % | slovenia | 24.55 % | poland | 23.83 % | czechia | 18.20 % | slovakia | 13.05 %, 
  but we like having `` nl '' in our usernames \u2639, 
   estonian here , we actually contribute our fair share to nato , when the big-wigs in europe do n't . 
  you have been contributing your `` fair share '' [ since 2015 ( p. 5 , table 3 ) ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_07/20160704_160704-pr2016-116.pdf ) . 
  which is surprising , as nato mostly benefits estonia . 
  your `` fair share '' also is 5.5 % of what the netherlands spends on defense . 
  country | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- estonia | 1.80 % | 1.70 % | 1.68 % | 1.89 % | 1.90 % | 1.94 % | 2.07 % | 2.16 % |  describes western europe to a tee . 
  uh , okay ... 
  i really like the second one actually . 
  that 's cool !, 
  [ george bush experienced the same when it comes to dogs . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/rkefxs8a0xk?t=315 ), 
  russia today is ** not ** the equivalent of the bbc . 
  anyone who has seen their junk `` journalism '' regarding the conflict in ukraine knows how horrible their propaganda is . 
  it 's a state tool that is used to influence public opinion abroad . 
   macron is just being an asshole . 
  being an asshole for calling out sputnik and russia today propaganda ? 
  how is he an asshole ? 
  this looks amazing !, 
   no greek terrorist organization ever targeted civilians , they target politicians , banks , bankers . 
  i thought golden dawn attacked immigrants and other brown people ?
