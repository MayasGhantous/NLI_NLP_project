   in fact , it is to society 's benefit to have a diversity of education , because it will not create a homogenous population that can only think in one way about some things . 
  please tell me more on these einstein and polyglot parents that can offer so much more than a school with dedicated teachers can . 
   and it is also about freedom . 
  parents ** should ** have the freedom over how they educate their children . 
  perhaps parents should not have the _ complete _ freedom to do as they please . 
  i , for one , welcome our new somali overlords . 
  russian propaganda is extremely effective . 
  russia today has a massive following in the west . 
  most online news articles attract pro-russian trolls asking for radar imagery and the like . 
  unfortunately . 
  pretty much . 
  we and many other countries can always veto and i think that even politicians that absolutely love the eu will agree that ukraine simply is not ready at all , not even within the next 5 or 10 years . 
  it honestly sounds like the exact same scaremongering about turkey during brexit and turkey actually is ( was , i suppose ) on the road to becoming an eu member . 
  i do n't think any of that means we should n't improve relations with ukraine with such a treaty . 
   hell holland language sounds more like a german dialekt dutch , not holland , is quite different from german to me at least and definitely not in the category of just a _ dialect _ , i am sure germans could vouch for that by pronouncing _ scheveningen _ or attempting to construct dutch sentences . 
  perhaps the words might sound somewhat similar , but not a whole lot more than that . 
  [ afrikaans ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3tti_gas5c ) would fit that category much better i believe . 
   it 's like saying that english people can easily understand german ... perhaps some of them might in the future . 
   however , in the fast pace of international commerce , boutique language speakers are at an economic disadvantage . 
  international news has to be translated into slovak , before it reaches our eyes and ears . 
  in a world where time is money , this comes at a cost . 
  how ? 
  when the author says :  we can communicate from polish to croatian , from czech to russian by using our mother tongue . 
  this is a tremendous advantage , considering that slavic languages are spoken by close to 300 million people . 
  the downside is that no one slavic language is a global one . 
  i must be reading it the wrong way , as it seems to heavily conflict . 
  all you have to do is learn english and you have a tremendous advantage instead of a disadvantage ? 
  which seems to be what the second quote is getting at . 
  what exactly is the point here ? 
  many other countries get by perfectly fine , most people here speak dutch , english and some are fluent in german or french , these are taught during their primary and secondary level of education . 
  i do n't think i am deluded , our economies are quite intertwined , you 're our third biggest export partner , but if you think i am wrong i would like you to expand on what you mean by other countries opposing the united kingdom . 
  if i recall correctly , the united kingdom had many extra options that do not apply to old or new members -- the rebate being one of them . 
  i think you can say that has been the case throughout history , yeah . 
   if you actually look at public opinion polls , most people are very sympathetic to renewable energy for instance , yet politicians are beholden to special interests who slowwalk reform . 
  i do n't see how that is the case in the netherlands at least . 
  we are doing just fine when it comes to renewable energy , charging points for electric cars and so on . 
  frankly , many are opposed actually to what is being done to improve the environment , so the opposite is true , think of [ banning diesel cars before the 1 ^ st of january 2001 from the city of utrecht ] ( https://www.utrecht.nl/wonen-en-leven/milieu/luchtkwaliteit/milieuzone-utrecht/ ) or wind turbines ruining the view . 
   i do n't share your starry-eyed view of the political class when their de facto performance has ranged from the mediocre to the atrocious . 
  that is just an over dramatization , at least of dutch politics , i do not think the majority herer shares your view of our politicians being atrocious . 
   someone like you with deep-seated contempt for the population should n't even be advocating democracy . 
  you 'd feel better at home in an authoritarian system . 
  no , i never said that , and that is quite insulting , i feel perfectly fine in a representative democracy which is our status quo . 
  so far our experiments with _ direct democracy _ have , in my opinion , failed horribly , as was shown during our referendum on the association agreement with ukraine . 
  what the referendum has shown is that populism runs rampant during such times , e.g. 
  ukraine will instantly become a member of the european union if you vote _ yes _ . 
  considering that many that led the campaign , jan roos for example , did not care about reading the association agreement with ukraine _ at all _ , despite being against it , and that this man now wants to continue his populist behavior in our parliament , i am of the opinion that this should not be repeated for quite some time . 
  i was actually reminded of all this when britain voted to leave the european union in which it was often said that turkey would become a member , even though it has failed to close many of its chapters and will _ extremely _ likely be vetoed by many countries even if it does close them ever . 
   people overrate the need for politicians to make decisions , at least on big topics . 
  no , they do n't . 
  in general people are uninformed and will vote on what _ feels _ right to them . 
  the type of choices referendums might be useful for is when you 're picking a new flag , such as new zealand . 
  uh , whiterights , kkk and so on ... 
  what about the mosque of c\u00f3rdoba ? 
   but hey at least we dont have any money problems in the netherlands we also do n't have tanks !, 
  take that greece !, 
  it 's very easy for people from a country like ours to talk about military matters in such ways . 
  i can imagine it is a very different situation for countries that have or had less favourable relationships with their neighbors . 
  ** flexible solidarity and flexible freedom ** --, 
  schiaparelli , more like scraperelli now . 
  it must suck for those that poured thousands of hours into it . 
  i hope the images nasa will provide can help prevent what happened . 
  no need to apologize , your opinion on this is of very little value . 
   so it 's barely edible food then . 
  ... you would enjoy the taste of real cheese and other milk products from ee . 
  yeah , because dutch cheese is terrible !, 
  i actually liked ti\u00ebsto 's music from the late '90s and think , regardless of what you think he now produces , that it is impressive he manages to stay relevant for that long . 
  netherlands stronk ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i did n't downvote , but care to explain ? 
  darn , considering that is even below the minimum wage here . 
  although the cost of living here is higher , i assume , i doubt that even makes up for it . 
  by how much have salaries improved over the years ? 
  thank you . 
  what does that page say ? 
   and us at the head of nato is n't ?!? 
  i ca n't recall the united states being at war with a european country , flying jets into the airspace of other countries without their knowledge , banning european products , diplomats , threatening us of consequences if we 'll do _ x _ or _ y _ and the list goes on and on . 
  furthermore , i believe u.s. troops were invited there . 
  at the end of the day the united states might have some faults , but it is a much better ally than russia . 
  i am not sure too on the source , but :  we may not be in eu but we may still have freedom of movement so it would affect us . 
  why even go for a brexit in that case ? 
  i thought curbing immigration was one of the most important aspects ? 
  sounds really petty , considering that the u.k. is the only member blocking this according to the article . 
  also , it will not affect them anyway , as they would not be in the european union anymore by the time montenegro might join . 
  i wonder what their reasoning for it is and what these `` concessions '' entail . 
  based on my experience as a black person you will not be harrassed or attacked in the netherlands depending on your ethnicity . 
  i actually want to visit poland some time in the future as someone who is half american ( jamaican ) and dutch , but hearing these things always make me sad and think twice . 
  that makes sense , thanks for answering instead of downvoting !, 
   according to this offer , the visas are to be lifted in stages until may 2018 . 
  however , unlike the bulgarian authorities , the romanian officials did n't agree with this deadline . 
  is it _ that _ pressing ? 
  it seems like a decent offer ? 
  i think someone mentioned github was blocked too ... 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/elvf7og0pqs?t=30 ), 
  of course and euromaidan was a cia operation also , yes ? 
  none of the people living in those countries have a will of their own ? 
  maybe it 's just me , but ending protests with violence seems like a textbook example on how to start a civil war . 
   why are they ignoring china , ** north korea ** and africa ? 
  what ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_war ask china why they send all the people that try to escape the north-korean regime back . 
  and what the heck are you talking about ? 
  many western countries , unfortunately i might add , do business with saudi-arabia .
