  it makes no sense for you to refute the guy 's post if you read the following interview between gordon parks and malcolm x , days before he was assassinated :  everybody 's wondering why i 've been going back and forth to africa . 
  well , first i went to mecca to get closer to the orthodox religion of islam . 
  i wanted firsthand views of the african leaders -- their problems are inseparable from ours . 
  the cords of bigotry and prejudice here can be cut with the same blade . 
  we have to keep that blade sharp and share it with one another . '', 
  now he was sounding like the old malcolm : `` strangely enough , listening to leaders like nasser , ben bella , and nkrumah awakened me to the dangers of racism . 
  i realized racism is n't just a black and white problem . 
  it 's brought bloodbaths to about every nation on earth at one time or another . '', 
   he stopped and remained silent for a few moments . 
  `` brother , '' he said finally , ' ** ` remember the time that white college girl came into the restaurant -- the one who wanted to help the muslims and the whites get together -- and i told her there was n't a ghost of a chance and she went away crying ? 
  '' **  `` yes . '', 
   ** `` well , i 've lived to regret that incident . 
  ** in many parts of the african continent i saw white students helping black people . 
  something like this kills a lot of argument . 
  i did many things as a [ black ] muslim that i 'm sorry for now . 
  i was a zombie then -- like all [ black ] muslims -- i was hypnotized , pointed in a certain direction and told to march . 
  well , i guess a man 's entitled to make a fool of himself if he 's ready to pay the cost . 
  it cost me twelve years . '', 
   `` that was a bad scene , brother . 
  the sickness and madness of those days -- i 'm glad to be free of them . 
  it 's a time for martyrs now . 
  ** and if i 'm to be one , it will be in the cause of brotherhood . 
  that 's the only thing that can save this country . 
  i 've learned it the hard way -- but i 've learned it . 
  and that 's the significant thing . 
  ** ''  as we parted he laid his hand on my shoulder , looked into my eyes and said , `` as-salaam-alaikum , brother . '', 
   `` and may peace be with you , malcolm , '' i answered . 
  why are you speaking for all black people ? 
  despite that being a weird claim , malcolm x his views actually aligned more with dr. king 's message right before his assassination . 
  i do n't think that is the case , as that would indicate a complete reversal , which is not the case . 
  to me it more or less looks like zigzagging while they 're invading neighbors . 
  how is it a stupid question ? 
  i 'm speaking about a hostile foreign policy towards members of the european union and the current neighbors of russia ? 
  edit : you said it was a stupid question and edited that ... 
  i do n't think this is the place for syria related discussions and my question that actually was related to the topic is left unanswered . 
  did russia 's foreign policy make a u-turn . 
  yes or no ? 
   turkey was always bad and worse before . 
  ask the armenians . 
  let 's ask ukraine , poland , estonia , latvia , lithuania and basically every other russian neighbor how they feel about russia or stalin if we 're going that far back into the past ? 
  i think they 've already been in a `` union '' with russia and i 'm pretty sure they 'd pass having them join now . 
  it 's not as if russian foreign policy has made a u-turn . 
  has it ? 
   now we 're helping them murder kurds and syrians for example . 
  : / and russia is a supporting a dictator that started the entire civil war because he did n't like protestors ? 
  assad , as shown , has no problem throwing dumb barrel bombs on cities with civilians . 
  what do you think is stopping him from throwing journalists or officials in jail , like erdogan ? 
  if we 're speaking about murdering syrians i do n't think you should look at turkey . 
  i 'm pretty sure erdogan got schooled by putin on how to deal with opposition and journalists . 
  turkey has n't always been this way . 
   why is europe ( and/or the usa for that matter ) not allied with russia ? 
  perhaps because they invaded ukraine , have nothing in common with the values shared by the european union -- even turkey has more in common -- and they have no problem shooting down airliners ? 
  oh , and they try to influence elections and destroy european unity . 
  no thanks . 
  god , that 's awful , i have been spreading fake news . 
  sincere apologies , you 're absolutely right . 
  i 'll go through the numbers again . 
  they 're not the most recent numbers , these are from 2015 , which is why i made the assumption that the ~ ~ $ 50.8 ~ ~ $ 70 billion probably is lower at the moment , as countries are slowly increasing their military expenditure -- i believe romania is either at or near 2 % right now ? 
  most parties here wanted to increase it but only by a tiny amount , which leaves me wondering how we 'll even meet our target in 2024 . 
   person with no pineapple on flag !, 
  [ i have a flag , i have pineapple ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct6bupve2sm&amp;t=37 ), 
  yeah , i was only ranking it by gdp , which is what trump seems to be concerned about ( countries not paying their fair share ) . 
  if we do not include the countries that spend _ more _ than 2 % on their military , that 's ** $ 75.5 billion ** missing from european nato members that are currently not paying enough , if i am not mistaken ? 
  including those countries , europe as a single entity `` owes '' ** $ 70 billion ** ?

  anyway clicking the table headers lets you sort each column . 
  the only countries that really matter are germany , united kingdom , france , italy and perhaps spain anyway -- if we 're looking at gdp , and half of them do pay their fair share . 
  the other countries are mostly pennies compared to the united states really . 
  i agree that everyone has to abide by what was agreed upon and pay their fair share , but still , it 's not as if the united states is suffering oh-so incredibly much because croatia , bulgaria or czechia are n't hitting 2 % . 
  i already mentioned this before , but i 'm interested how politicians here ( the netherlands ) will be spinning that one . 
  i know france is around 2 % , and we 're probably going to increase our military expenditure , but we would need to spend $ 13.4 billion to hit 2 % , while we 're currently at [ $ 7.9 billion ] ( https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/prinsjesdag/inhoud/miljoenennota-rijksbegroting-en-troonrede/huishoudboekje ) or about 1.17 % . 
  the largest increase was set by the cda ( christian democratic appeal ) at $ 2.1 billion , which means we would be halfway , but still be $ 3.4 billion shy of the 2 % of gdp guideline . 
  i did n't even mention that the biggest party that won here ( vvd ) only wants to spend half of that , a meager $ 1 billion . 
  i think we need to quit fooling ourselves and perhaps renegotiate or look for something else . 
  it 's obvious that committing to 2 % will not be popular in the netherlands . 
  it does n't `` replace '' anything ? 
  even if european nations hit 2 % , it 's not going to even it out , as the u.s. spends about 600 billion usd on their military . 
  compare that to our meager 7.9 billion eur at 1.17 % of gdp or 13 billion eur at 2 % gdp . 
  that does n't mean we should n't hit that target , i firmly believe we should if that was agreed upon . 
  also , nato is mutually beneficial . 
  i 'm sure the u.s. would be less happy if we 'd be china or russia 's gimp . 
  france and the united kingdom , two of the three countries that have the biggest military expenditure , are also at about 2 % , so the only countries you could be speaking about are the netherlands , belgium and germany i suppose ? 
   western europe spending on eastern european defense . 
  everyone is supposed to keep their military expenditure either at or above 2 % . 
  we do not have to spend anything on anyone else . 
  estonia and poland for example meet their 2 % . 
  where do you get this twisted idea from that `` western-europe '' should pay for others ? 
  perhaps i 'm wrong , but i assume / u/anarchisto pointed to the romanian budget and not the nato 2 % guideline of gdp ? 
  supposedly we ( the netherlands ) spend [ $ 264.4 billion in total ] ( https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/prinsjesdag/inhoud/miljoenennota-rijksbegroting-en-troonrede/huishoudboekje ) , of which $ 7.9 billion goes towards our military . 
  in other words ( 7.9 / 264.4 ) * 100 = 2.99 % of our entire budget , but only about 1.17 % of our gdp . 
  i think i saw that , yes . 
  i only visit when i expect they 'll have a meltdown , e.g. 
  macron winning . 
   troops bases/all over the world funny enough my dad actually came to the netherlands that way . 
  i posted down below that the incentive for us to increase our military expenditure somewhat seems to be there . 
  raising it to about 1.5 % over the next 4 years would be good , but any politician wanting to increase our military expenditure even further , to the guideline of 2 % , and after increasing it already , might not find that much support . 
  we currently spend $ 8 billion and at 2 % that would be about $ 13.4 billion .
