   i know netherlands has a right-wing ( sorry do n't know european terms for conservative ) government right now . 
  we do n't really have a government at the moment as they 're still trying to form a coalition . 
  greenleft ( groenlinks ) also won quite some seats and they 're not really interested in spending more on defense to my knowledge and disappointment . 
   perhaps that is the difference between netherlands and the rest of europe which is relatively left wing ? 
  i 'm not sure actually , i do n't know what the attitudes towards military expenditure is of other european countries , so excuse my ignorance . 
  those of other countries would be much better at explaining their situation . 
  i do n't think many would consider france to be right-wing for example , but they do seem to be around the 2 % guideline if i have to believe [ world bank ( 2015 ) ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs?end=2015&amp;locations=nl-de-be-fr-gb-es-pl-no-pt-ca-it&amp;start=2015&amp;view=bar ) or [ the economist ( 2015 ) ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/02/daily-chart-11 ) , but the [ statistics from nato ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_07/20160704_160704-pr2016-116.pdf ) differ . 
  interesting thing though is that most european countries actually were  2 % in the '90s if i take a quick look at the world bank data , with france even exceeding the current spending of the united states in percentages . 
  hmmm , i do n't think so , but i 'm open to your point of view . 
  just to give you a bit of insight on the situation here : the parties that won here did so on a platform that said [ they would increase our military expenditure ] ( https://www.trouw.nl/home/bij-vrijwel-alle-politieke-partijen-staat-defensie-weer-in-de-gunst~a903777f/ ) for the next four years . 
  many parties agreed on that . 
  we currently spend around $ 7.9 -- 8 billion , only hitting about 1.17 % and they want to increase it to around a total of $ 9 -- 10 billion in the next 4 years , with the cda ( christian democratic appeal ) wanting to increase it the most ( $ 2,1 billion ) . 
  if we 're optimistic and they continue with those plans they might hit 1.5 % in 4 years if the following holds true : ( ( military expenditure * euro-to-dollar ) / total gdp ) * 100 = military expenditure in % or ( ( 7.9 * 1.12 ) / 752.5 ) * 100 = 1.176 % military expenditure in eur | percentage of gdp -- | -- 8 | 1.19 % 9 | 1.34 % 10 | 1.48 %, 
  the u.s. spends nearly double the guideline ( 3.7 % ) on their military . 
  they 're free to lower it . 
  this has also already been mentioned during the nato wales summit in 2014 , under the obama administration , if i 'm not mistaken :  we agree to reverse the trend of declining defence budgets , to make the most effective use of our funds and to further a more balanced sharing of costs and responsibilities . 
   ...  * allies currently meeting the nato guideline to spend a minimum of 2 % of their gross domestic product ( gdp ) on defence will aim to continue to do so . 
  likewise , allies spending more than 20 % of their defence budgets on major equipment , including related research & development , will continue to do so . 
  * allies whose current proportion of gdp spent on defence is below this level will : * ** halt any decline in defence expenditure ** ; * aim to increase defence expenditure in real terms as gdp grows ; * ** aim to move towards the 2 % guideline within a decade with a view to meeting their nato capability targets and filling nato 's capability shortfalls ** . 
  [ wales summit declaration , nato ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm ) not really getting what trump 's point is . 
  `` you should pay more '' , yeah trump , that 's already been discussed . 
  you 're late to the party . 
  i had to laugh at / r/the _ donald when someone said :  well , that 's what he gets for not paying his fair share to nato . 
  obviously they do n't seem to be up-to-date on things . 
  that 's incredibly sad and actually makes me feel sick . 
  hmmm , well they were deported by stalin , so it explains why they are now a minority . 
   i get that culture changes but europe has such a deep history and culture what is `` europe '' to you ? 
  the netherlands has a completely different history and relation to its immigrants than let 's say poland . 
   if you paint on someone 's painting it becomes part of it , but did n't you just damaged it ? 
  i have to say that the first thing i thought about was the [ ecce homo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k1qej2w.jpg ) restoration . 
  i think it 's apt though , it depends on what others add to said painting in my opinion . 
  it might look better than it did before or it might end up looking like the restoration of ecce homo . 
   oh c'mon , crimea was predominantly russian since the first census huh , where are you getting these numbers from ? 
  ethnic group | 1897 | 1926 | 1939 | 1979 | 1989 | 2001 | 2014 -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- russians | 33.11 % | 42.2 % | 49.6 % | 66.9 % | 67.0 % | 60.4 % | 65.3 % ukrainians | 11.84 % | 10.6 % | 13.7 % | 25.1 % | 25.8 % | 24.0 % | 15.7 % crimean tatars | 35.55 % | 25.1 % | 19.4 % | 0.2 % | 1.6 % | 10.8 % | 12.2 % for the 1897 census [ this website ] ( http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97_uezd_eng.php?reg=1456 ) is referenced which ultimately adds up to 180.963 as the mainland is ignored . 
  it also mentions the following :  ** the first general census of the russian empire of 1897 . 
  ** look at the taurida governate . 
  it mentions that crimea had five administrative divisions ( uyezds ) and two city municipalities ( gradonachalstvo ) : county / city | great russians | crimean tatars | ukrainian -- | -- | -- | -- yevpatoriysky uyezd | 11107 | 26992 | 13345 perekopsky uyezd | 11743 | 12266 | 11316 simferopolsky uyezd | 42833 | 62876 | 10132 feodosiysky uyezd | 34974 | 44431 | 13304 yaltsky uyezd | 19879 | 43256 | 2024 city of kerch | 24370 | 2563 | 7037 city of sebastopol | 36057 | 1910 | 7545 total | 180963 | 194294 | 64703, 
  who ? 
  what ? 
  sincere question , but which minorities are we speaking about here ? 
  i thought ska , curry and many other things were now part of the culture in the u.k ? 
  `` i reject your reality and substitute my own '' -- recep tayyip erdo\u011fan, 
  ah , that 's quite a twist , so they were apparently held by a battalion named the organization of ukrainian nationalists ( oun ) : * [ stolen dutch paintings offered for sale by ukrainian militia , the guardian ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/dec/07/stolen-dutch-paintings-sale-ukrainian-militia ) * [ stolen dutch paintings recovered in ukraine , bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36052485 ) they found the paintings and then wanted an amount of money for them in exchange that vastly exceeded their real value . 
  also interesting how some in the ukrainian sbu and the right-wing svoboda were apparently involved . 
  wow , what the heck is this ? 
  are those the weird bikers that wanted to head to berlin ? 
   are still in the ukrainian territory ? 
  [ they 're in eastern ukraine and were found in a pro-russian villa . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-netherlands-stolen-art-iduskcn11m1t8 ) honestly , if i were ukrainian i 'd give fuck all about these paintings and would n't send men/women to their deaths in an effort to retrieve foreign `` paintings '' . 
   they did n't give them back . 
  ca n't cooperate with people who wo n't cooperate but they did return some ? 
  it even mentions they were found in a * pro-russian * villa in eastern ukraine ? 
  it 's a bit difficult for them to look for paintings in an area that is ridden with a proxy militia ? 
  * [ ukraine hands back stolen paintings to dutch museum ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-netherlands-stolen-art-iduskcn11m1t8 ), 
  concerning those protestors at the arrival of sinterklaas ? 
  i do n't and i do n't think many others will agree with the way they want about it , but that does n't invalidate the entire debate concerning the figure or gives people a free pass on calling for the deportation of others , no ? 
  another example : do i agree with what prem radhakishun did on television , mentioning that sinterklaas is not real in an attempt to ruin it for children ? 
  no , of course not . 
  my mom 's dutch and my dad 's american , so yes , i remember and i have celebrated it with family and the times with _ them _ as a child were wonderful . 
  there was no black pete , as my dutch grandfather would just knock on the window at night , leaving a huge bag with presents for all of us at the door . 
  thus the argument that it ab-so-lute-ly ca n't do without a less caricature looking version of him or that it would make it less fun is a silly one to me -- i 'm not asking for a removal . 
  now spending that time with other people during that time of the year was less enjoyable . 
  i honestly ca n't stand the extreme comments i have seen towards black people , e.g. 
  our [ football team ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2014/11/58390/ ) at the time , comparing them to black pete or threats when it was covered on talkshows or by journalists as reporters without borders mentions . 
   and those zwarte piet protesters should also just calm the fuck down . 
  they are screaming and stuff when the people just want to enjoy it with their kids and they are telling people sinterklaas doesnt exist and shit . 
  kinda fucked up , no wonder people have a problem with them lol . 
  you know that 's not true . 
  the hostile environment was even listed as [ the reason ] ( https://rsf.org/en/netherlands ) why we dropped on the reporters without borders ' press freedom index :  controversy about the role of a black-faced children 's character black pete led to death threats towards journalists , columnists , and television personalities . 
  [ ah , the ol' turkish switcheroo !, 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6co6g3/turkey_condemns_us_over_aggressive_acts_against/dhw8u2r/ ), 
  ah , the ol' turkish switcheroo !, 
   building luxury cars ( and suv \u00b4 s wtf . ), 
  for the top 1 % and finance the project with the american taxpayers money . 
  i do n't understand . 
  can you explain this ? 
  if i go to their website , they say [ the following ] ( https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early ) :  ** tesla repays department of energy loan nine years early **  only american car company to have paid back government  may 22nd , 2013  palo alto , calif. -- tesla motors announced that it has paid off the entire loan awarded to the company by the department of energy in 2010 . 
  in addition to payments made in 2012 and q1 2013 , today 's wire of almost half a billion dollars ( $ 451.8 m ) repays the full loan facility with interest . 
  following this payment , ** tesla will be the only american car company to have fully repaid the government . 
  **  ...  in 2010 , ** tesla was awarded a milestone-based loan ** , requiring matching private capital obtained via public offering , by the doe as part of the advanced technology vehicle manufacturing program . 
  this program was signed into law by president bush in 2008 and then awarded under the obama administration in the years that followed . 
  ** this program is often confused with the financial bailouts provided to the then bankrupt gm and chrysler ** , who were ineligible for the atvm program , because a requirement of that program was good financial health . 
  if we then look at this [ atvm program ] ( https://energy.gov/lpo/services/atvm-loan-program ) it says the following :  ** about the atvm loan program **  advanced technology vehicles manufacturing ( atvm ) loans support the development of advanced technology vehicles ( atv ) and associated components in the united states . 
  ** they also meet higher efficiency standards . 
  **  ...  ** here are two sample atvm projects : **  * ** ford motor company ** is using a ** $ 5.9 billion ** loan to upgrade factories across illinois , kentucky , michigan , missouri , and ohio and to introduce new technologies that will raise the fuel efficiency of more than a dozen popular vehicles . 
  the project will convert nearly 33,000 employees to green manufacturing jobs . 
   * ** nissan ** is using a ** $ 1.4 billion ** atvm loan to retool their smyrna , tennessee , manufacturing facility and construct one of the largest advanced battery manufacturing plants in the united states . 
  the plant will be capable of producing 200,000 advanced-technology batteries a year . 
  i do n't think you can get mad at tesla for making use of what others also seem to be using ? 
  if i got it wrong , please explain . 
  i like the european union , but what is up with [ that video ? 
  ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bsbx39dlhbi/ ) i 've never seen someone wave a flag with such enthusiasm either . 
   i would like to see if lithuania would have granted asylum to a gay man from , let 's say , slovenia or france . 
  i do n't think the situation in chechnya and france is comparable , at all . 
   i think that this `` generosity '' from lithuania is just another way to talk shit about russia . 
  if russia does n't want that , then why do n't they act and protect their minorities ? 
  it 's pretty sad that instead lithuania has to offer these people refuge . 
  i thought the british said they wanted to strengthen ties with the commonwealth , but apparently not . 
   i also heard about that ... m\u00e4mmi thing . 
  haha , have n't heard of that .
