  i 'm also not sure if i am ready to try swedish things after hearing about surstr\u00f6mming , i kid . 
  i do n't see much of them on our shelves . 
  there you have it , netherlands , new space for exports !, 
  i know !, 
  her mother absolutely loves them , so i send them when i can . 
  they definitely should export them . 
   this ends up being a good thing in the end i think , they 'll have to reform some things , up to a point , at least to drain the funds . 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  regarding the last point : i hope so too !, 
  i 'm mixed and ultimately people decide for themselves who they marry or have intercourse with , they do n't have to consult you for this . 
  nobody said anything about `` white people being so 1990s . '', 
  either . 
  just because someone has a different skin color or ethnicity does n't mean they ca n't integrate . 
  it 's cultural differences that clash . 
   almonds in sugar ... this might explain your teeth :p ( too sugary for my taste , brrr . ), 
  haha , now it makes sense . 
  i wonder if you 'd like [ drop ] ( https://blog.kamernet.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/drop.jpg ) ( licorice in english ) . 
  she was disgusted unfortunately by the taste . 
  seems to only be a northern - and western-european thing so far , but i 'd gladly be proven wrong . 
  stroopwafels however , they seem to be universally loved !, 
   on one hand , i think we have too many very good friends running the country . 
  ah , i heard this was also the case in hiring for some positions ? 
  we in dutch might call it `` vriendjespolitiek '' , but in english they would just call it nepotism . 
  it definitely changed my perspective on some things , reminds me of the fact that we should n't simply take a lot of things for granted here . 
   on the other hand , bajadera . 
  i do n't want any harm to come to it same here , please keep it safe . 
   yes , agrokor is our lord and savior , the bossiest boss that ever bossed , resistance is futile . 
  ( even when they crash into `` too many denbts '' , this is why we 'll be rescuing them now , probably with taxes or similar . 
  15 % of our gdp , it 's a plot . ), 
  i mostly meant the influence such a company has i tried to ask her about it and i got a hdz rant in return . 
  croatian politics seems very polarized i have to say . 
   try bajadera !, 
  i did !, 
  including bananko , doma\u0107ica , dorina , jadro , lino lada ( she likes this stuff , i do too ) and many more . 
  one of my favorites has to be arancini though !, 
  i wish we would have that here . 
  might try to make it myself otherwise i also liked these almonds that were just called `` bademi u \u0161e\u0107eru '' , almonds with sugar , i think ? 
  i remember feeling sorry for my teeth while eating them though . 
  agrokor in croatia . 
  my girlfriend went on a rant when i asked her about it . 
  shout-out to / u/guildensterncrantz , should have warned me !, 
  ivory coast ? 
  i get that it 's part of thr francophone world , but i thought they did n't like black people considering it 's anti-immigrant stances ? 
  is that not the case ? 
  what would they even do there ? 
  i think , or hope , he 's making a joke !, 
  i know , we have a lot of bad dutch hombres in the netherlands , but some of them , i guess , are good people . 
   ukrainians had approximately the same support for both the custom union and eu association in 2013 . http://imgur.com/a/1rrlk the [ next slide ] ( http://imgur.com/a/0fcfu ) in [ that presentation ] ( https://www.slideshare.net/ratinggroup/2014-april-5-iri-public-opinion-survey-of-ukraine-march-14-26-2014 ) is quite interesting . 
  i was just looking at those statistics for the netherlands , here 's a list for most european nationals : ** [ registrations and arrests of suspects by nationality ( 2014 ) ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=82315ned&amp;d1=3,5,8-10&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=1,3,6-9,11-12,15-17,20-22,24-27,29,31,33&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=15&amp;hdr=g4,g1,g3&amp;stb=t,g2&amp;vw=t ) ** nationality | bicycle theft | car theft | pickpocketing | shoplifting | burglary -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- dutch | 5620 | 1250 | 410 | 29520 | 7380 albanian | 0 | 0 | 0 | 30 | 50 belgian | 10 | 10 | 0 | 190 | 20 bosnian | 10 | 0 | 100 | 60 | 0 british | 20 | 0 | 0 | 120 | 20 bulgarian | 30 | 20 | 140 | 170 | 40 german | 30 | 10 | 10 | 260 | 30 french | 10 | 10 | 20 | 120 | 50 greek | 10 | 0 | 0 | 50 | 0 hungarian | 0 | 0 | 10 | 110 | 20 irish | 0 | 0 | 0 | 20 | 10 italian | 20 | 0 | 20 | 220 | 30 latvian | 10 | 0 | 0 | 170 | 20 lithuanian | 40 | 30 | 10 | 360 | 70 polish | 470 | 40 | 20 | 2130 | 210 portuguese | 30 | 0 | 0 | 140 | 20 romanian | 10 | 10 | 420 | 2620 | 200 russian | 10 | 0 | 0 | 150 | 10 slovak | 0 | 0 | 10 | 40 | 10 spanish | 20 | 0 | 0 | 130 | 30 czech | 10 | 0 | 0 | 50 | 10 i would keep in mind though that it 's just nationality and that a significant chunk of these people do n't even live here . 
  he used to call for the deportation of such criminals , but i have n't heard him speak about them for quite some time . 
  there have n't been any terror attacks from surinamese or those from the ( former ) dutch antilles , which i believe are much more gripping than other crimes and also to be a stronger influencer on public opinion towards these groups . 
  i think that 's why he has n't spoken about them as much . 
  i did n't look into which crimes are mostly committed by each group , but those that are out of mind , out of sight would also be less of an influencer , i think . 
  begging gangs on the street or pickpockets are things people might be confronted with more often . 
  keep in mind that it 's all just speculation on my part though . 
  registered crimes do seem to be dropping for all the groups mentioned above , so that 's a good thing . 
  it has little to do with muslims per se . 
  people from surinam and the former dutch antilles commit more crimes too , yet the majority of surinamese are christian . 
  ** [ registered suspects per 10.000 citizens by ethnicity ( 2014 ) ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=81947ned&amp;d1=46-48&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=1,3,5-8&amp;d5=15-17&amp;hdr=g2,g1,g3,g4&amp;stb=t&amp;vw=t ) ** ethnicity | assault | threats and stalking | sexual crimes -- | -- | -- | -- native | 17 | 8 | 2 morocco | 87 | 55 | 6 ( former ) dutch antilles | 115 | 58 | 10 surinam | 75 | 44 | 6 turkey | 59 | 34 | 4, 
   so their index is more of an index of how pro migrant , so called progressive a country is , without checking sweden will be near on top . 
  this is an absolutely ridiculous claim . 
  their explanation on changes in rankings is quite fair . 
  we , actually dropped a couple of places in case you did n't care to click on `` find out more '' when hovering over countries :  controversy about the role of a black-faced children 's character black pete led to death threats towards journalists , columnists , and television personalities . 
   as public opinion regarding issues of immigration , race , and `` national character '' has polarized , attacks on the media have increased . 
  fear of terrorism and organized crime has led to controversial legislation . 
   changes to the dutch law wiv ( intelligence and security services act ) now give government intelligence and security services increased powers in the decryption of secured communications networks and the tapping of phones and internet communication systems . 
  this could undermine the protection of journalists ' sources . 
  parliament adopted the changes by a large majority on february 14th , 2017 . 
  legal protection of press freedom in the netherlands nevertheless remains relatively robust . 
  https://rsf.org/en/netherlands switzerland ( 7 ) also is n't _ that _ pro-migrant and ranks higher than germany ( 16 ) . 
  no , romanian nationals are responsible for 40 % of pickpocketing in the netherlands . 
  really ? 
  that 's cool !, 
  the more you know . 
  from the russian and slavic flags being inspired by the dutch one to the orange on the irish flag sharing its history with the dutch one too . 
  awesome !, 
  ah , i did n't approve of it , i was just surprised that it has some relation to our country . 
  it seems my comment has rubbed some people the wrong way . 
  i do n't know much about the history of ireland yet unfortunately , so it 's difficult for me to comment on these issues . 
  is n't this the base where the united states keeps some of its nuclear arsenal ? 
   go to marsa and see them defecating in the street and the pond , staring the local elderly down aggressively and arguing loudly in their languages . 
  might aswell be magaluf , i kid . 
  interesting , i wondered what was up with the orange dress and found this :  the loyal orange institution more commonly known as the orange order , is a protestant fraternal organisation based primarily in northern ireland ... its name is a tribute to the dutch-born protestant king ** william of orange ** , who defeated the army of catholic king james vii & ii in the williamite war in ireland ( 1688 -- 1691 ) . 
  [ orange order , wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orange_order ), 
  who 's that kid next to lukashenko ? 
  looks evil and just [ like that kid from insidious ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rpluykt.jpg ) . 
  yeah , that 's what i was trying to get at , my bad . 
  thanks !, 
  my point was that there 's a difference in mosques and that there might be differences in what is recited . 
  it seems the turkish mosques in the netherlands are tied to either the diyanet , sicn ( stichting islamitisch centrum nederland ) or mill\u00ee g\u00f6r\u00fc\u015f ? 
   where non-european groups are helpless innocents who must be protected from all criticism - on the other hand you have eastern europeans , who are free targets that you can fire all types of hateful vitriol at , and no one will call you a bigot or a nazi because you 're talking about white people . 
  well , wilders his party does not mainly target eastern europeans , his main target is islam as you can deduce from [ his cover photo on twitter ] ( http://i.imgur.com/orkbuf0.png ) . 
  even people that vote for wilders would probably tell me that is a fair assessment , because that 's what they apparently want , less muslims or in dutch '' [ minder marokkanen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_yepog5n8k ) '' . 
  i assume ukip is a different case . 
  the fact unfortunately is though that some people from eastern european countries are heavily overrepresented in certain types of crime here . 
  this of course shapes public opinion , especially once people are actually confronted with these facts themselves such as with professional begging gangs from romania or pickpockets . 
  here is some data ( 2014 ) from our central bureau of statistics on [ registrations and arrests by nationality ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=82315ned&amp;d1=5,8-10&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=1,23-24,26,32,34&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=15&amp;hdr=g4,g1,g3&amp;stb=t,g2&amp;vw=t ) for some crimes : nationality | car theft | pickpocketing | shoplifting -- | -- | -- | -- dutch | 1250 | 410 | 29520 moroccan | 50 | 40 | 760 polish | 40 | 20 | 2130 romanian | 10 | 420 | 2620 surinamese | 0 | 0 | 130 turkish | 20 | 10 | 190 our central bureau of statistics even [ notes ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2015/08/1-op-de-10-verdachten-van-misdrijf-is-buitenlander-zonder-vast-adres ) :  dutch : van alle verdachten van zakkenrollerij in 2013 is 40 procent roemeens en 16 procent bulgaars . 
   english : of those that were suspected of pickpocketing in 2013 , 40 percent were romanian and 16 percent bulgarian . 
  thus , the criticism that some have after the increase in crime is not entirely unwarranted . 
  anecdotally , my neighbor 's car was stolen by a polish person that was stopped and arrested at the german -- polish border .
