  i have heard many things that are abhorrent throughout my life due to my biracial background , but that 's just what you have to deal with as a minority . 
  the vast majority of native dutch people are great and very welcoming . 
  polish people now even make up one of our largest minorities at about 150.000 i think . 
   xenophobia against eastern europeans is normal for progressive western liberals so i 'm used to it by now . 
  i 'm not sure why you are projecting this on `` progressive western liberals '' as geert wilders his [ polenmeldpunt ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/02/problems_with_poles_report_the/ ) -- a place where people could report poles to , if they caused problems -- was opposed and heavily criticized _ by _ those `` progressive western liberals '' that you blame for xenophobia . 
   the infection with salafism does not date back to the gastarbeiter time . 
  i was mostly referring to the different views on politics and the protests here during the turkish referendum when there were clashes . 
  the differences between the voting behavior of turks in other countries is quite vast : country | yes | yes ( % ) | no | no ( % ) -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- czech republic | 73 | 12.54 % | 509 | 87.46 % united states | 5,296 | 16.20 % | 27,397 | 83.80 % united kingdom | 7,177 | 20.26 % | 28,247 | 79.79 % switzerland | 19,181 | 38.08 % | 31,193 | 61.92 % germany | 412,149 | 63.07 % | 241,353 | 36.93 % the netherlands | 82,672 | 70.94 % | 33,871 | 29.06 %  it is mostly a question of the last 25 years , coming hand-to-hand with all the saudi arabia-backed wahhabi imams . 
  i do n't think that really is the case for turkish mosques here . 
  moroccans and other arabs here go to arab mosques that are , perhaps , influenced by saudi-arabia . 
  that 's something i think should change , but even some syrians supposedly complained about that here : [ in germany , syrians find mosques too conservative ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-mosques-insig-iduskcn12s0he ) . 
  if you are speaking about the netherlands , you just lumped together turks , moroccans and syrians as if they 're all the same . 
  most turks and moroccans -- that now have children -- came here in the '60s as guest workers from rural , more conservative/traditional areas in their former countries . 
  they were not required to speak the language as most of them would be expected to head home like the italians and spanish guest workers that came here in those years . 
  it 's a bit unfair to project the problems associated with those groups onto syrians , simply because they are also muslim . 
  he does not want a reform of the european union . 
  he has been the most vocal about a possible dutch exit , also known as nexit . 
  he also wants to return back to the dutch guilder . 
  i could go on , but he has been very clear on exiting the union , not reforming it or being granted opt-outs . 
  it 's the second point in [ his party 's program ] ( https://pvv.nl/images/conceptverkiezingsprogrammma.pdf ) :  dutch : nederland weer onafhankelijk . 
   english : the netherlands will become independent again . 
  so we will leave the eu . 
  he only works with fp\u00d6 , front national and others due to their shared euroscepticism . 
  he 's [ incredibly pro-israel ] ( https://twitter.com/search?q=israel or isra\u00ebl or nederzetting or palestijnen or palestina from % 3ageertwilderspvv ) , unlike most other parties . 
  i just imagine germany body slamming malta , [ like so ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn2fb60yhjm ) . 
   are there still conflicts and animosity between eu members ? 
  i think the answer to this question depends on each country . 
  there is , to my knowledge , no animosity towards our neighbors germany and belgium . 
   what are your feelings about turkey joining the eu ? 
  turkey will not join the european union anytime soon due to the rhetoric and actions of its leader . 
  repeatedly turkey has shown no intent on joining the european union by : * intending on enacting the death penalty , which is forbidden by the [ echr ] ( http://www.echr.coe.int/documents/convention_eng.pdf ) ( p. 38 , art . 
  1 ; p. 53 , art . 
  hungary [ was notified ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/30/eu-jean-claude-juncker-viktor-orban-hungary-death-penalty-return ) that they would have to exit the union when viktor orb\u00e1n wanted a eu-wide `` debate '' on the death penalty . 
  * not respecting rule of law , [ freedom of the press ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking ) . 
  * calling its members ( the netherlands , germany ) [ fascists and remnants of nazism ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39251216 ) . 
  * attempts at [ blackmailing the eu ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/world/europe/turkey-recep-tayyip-erdogan-migrants-european-union.html ) by letting hundreds of thousands of refugees move freely towards eu member states . 
  all of these points make turkish membership a very , very unlikely thing to happen . 
  i think so too and it makes sense . 
  i doubt anyone in ukraine could care much about the title of `` being a member '' , but much more about seeing actual reforms and improvements with our help -- wherever we can help that is . 
  as much as i would like , i do n't think that is a great idea -- if the u.k. will exit the union around 2020 . 
  i 'm fine with trade and economic cooperation , but membership will likely be vetoed due to the current political climate here . 
  i also think it still could serve as leverage and a tool to help ukraine with reforms . 
  you never disappoint . 
   the far right one wants to kick all the poor countries out of the eurozone . 
  i do n't mean to offend , but is n't wallonia quite poor ? 
  what are their views on that part of belgium ? 
  is this vlaams belang you are speaking about ? 
  makes one wonder , the kingdom of the netherlands could have had a spaceport in surinam !, 
  also near the equator and right next to french guiana . 
   economic studies show again and again , from country to country , that immigrants provide a net benefit financially over the long run . 
  does n't that depend on the type of immigrant ? 
  somalis and many other non-western immigrants perform [ poorly ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2015/31/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand ) unfortunately and are often on welfare . 
  take a look at these numbers from our central bureau of statistics : origin | amount on welfare | total | people on welfare from own group | -- | -- | -- | -- | native | 194.250 | 13.226.829 | 1,47 % foreigner ( western ) | 54.680 | 1.655.699 | 3,30 % foreigner ( non-western ) | 247.580 | 2.096.592 | 11,80 % the data can be found here : * [ population ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=37296ned&amp;d1=25-26,29-30&amp;d2=l&amp;hdr=g1&amp;stb=t&amp;vw=t ) * [ welfare ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=82016ned&amp;d1=0&amp;d2=0,7-9&amp;d3=107&amp;hdr=t&amp;stb=g1,g2&amp;vw=t ) honestly , i must be doing something wrong here , because this looks a lot more unsettling than i thought it would do . 
  i probably messed up _ bigly _ somewhere . 
  i 'm open to any input , benefits is n't the only thing that comes into play of course , but i find the thought of thousands of unskilled workers entering the country , while unskilled work seems to become more scarce due to automatization , quite troubling . 
  to go from _ `` circumcision might traumatize '' _ to _ `` circumcision is a contributing factor to unrest in mena countries '' _ is nothing more than conjecture . 
  this is also what you are doing . 
  you do realize a big portion in the united states has been circumcised ? 
  it 's akin to saying school shootings in the united states are caused by the lack of foreskin . 
  out of all factors that can attribute to unrest in mena countries , i think `` lack of foreskin '' is going to be down at the very bottom . 
  this really does n't make sense . 
  it seems you have a very distorted version of politics here ? 
  what do you think our socialist party is about ? 
  i do n't even vote for them , but to associate them with atrocities is just wrong . 
  oh darn , i do , just not minutes after waking up from a long night !, 
  my bad . 
  many here also do not have credit cards to my knowledge . 
   it will take some time before she will get to know some muslims , who will teach her a few lessons . 
  on what ? 
  making moroccan , turkish or bosnian dishes ? 
   okamura i forgot about this guy . 
  `` that sounds japanese ... oh wait '', 
  she is obviously intimidating the neo-nazi with her extremist outfit and being all up in his face . 
  how would you know ? 
  do you speak to 16 year old girl scouts a lot ? 
  reminds me of [ this website ] ( http://kill-or-cure.herokuapp.com/ ) . 
  [ the finnish god presents itself ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4agdce6nrz0 ), 
  he keeps posting that stupid stuff everywhere . 
  let 's not forget paul bremer 's de-ba ` athification and all the other points in history that created fertile grounds for an organization such as isis to even exist . 
  come on , cheer up , nobody is saying that . 
  i do n't think it is entirely fair or should solely rest on the shoulders of supposedly `` black people '' . 
  there are a lot more layers to it than just skin color . 
  for instance , most black people in the netherlands came from surinam ( 349.022 ) and the former dutch antilles ( 150.981 ) , while those in france or portugal came from completely different parts of the world and would have brought a different culture with them . 
  i 'm mixed myself ( dutch/african-american ) and do n't have much in common really with those from surinam or the former antilles . 
  i do n't speak the [ papiamentu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/papiamento ) language for example . 
  the opinions of people in e.g. 
  the netherlands could be very different than those from belgium , although that 's just an example . 
  it makes me wonder on what those in countries with nearly no black people base their views on . 
  * cue westworld intro *, 
  i get that part , neither do i. i do n't understand the reasoning in his/her comment afterwards though . 
  well , i really do n't understand how one comes to that conclusion . 
  i mean , / r/europe hating hungary because it is ... _ too white _ ? 
  more likely , those that downvoted him did so due to other reasons . 
  i would n't know why others did , that 's not up to me . 
  i got one too , so downvotes work in mysterious ways i suppose . 
  yeah , fair enough , i do n't think there 's anything wrong with immigration as long as the cultures or two groups do n't clash too much . 
  i think it holds true on a much smaller scale domestically too , albeit it would have much less of an impact than foreigners that do not even speak the language . 
  so belgium did n't let in those migrant workers in on their own accord ? 
  i mean , you only have your ( previous ) politicians to blame really if so . 
  i do n't see what soros has to do with that ?
