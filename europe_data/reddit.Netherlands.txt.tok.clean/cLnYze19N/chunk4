  to shift all blame onto the united states is disingenuous . 
  how so ? 
  syria 's weaponry that was used against its own people , e.g. 
  helicopters to drop barrel bombs from , were not supplied by the united states ? 
  i remember daan roosegaarde [ did the same ] ( http://www.vangoghbrabant.com/nl/meer-van-gogh/fietspad ) here in the netherlands in 2014 . 
  were n't around 100.000 from albania , bosnia , kosovo and serbia ? 
  competition would be more than welcome !, 
  oh wow , the downvote and upvote icons there . 
  i do n't think the model s was meant for your average consumer . 
  [ the model 3 ] ( https://www.tesla.com/model3 ) , at around $ 35.000 , will be , no ? 
   this is the real unification we want to see even if it means all out war with poland and russia . 
  how about no . 
  who is `` we '' anyway ? 
  care to clarify ? 
  shame to see some want to turn poland into the texas of europe . 
   what a strange decision for a hiring company to make , history and basic observation makes it clear that those are actually the two most fundamental characteristics to be good at that profession . 
  i assume i misread , but are you saying being white and male are fundamental characteristics for being a good comedian ? 
   why is n't canada having these problems when i have about a thousand or more immigrants living in the hotels and apartments within two blocks of my home and a mosque on the same block ? 
  because your country is seperated by the atlantic ocean and is nowhere near the hotspot of violence that causes these people to migrate ? 
  if i recall correctly , the united states suffered and suffers from the same problem ? 
  edit : we also do n't get to pick who may enter , they just enter schengen without permission or any knowledge whatsoever , no vetting process whatsoever . 
  genuinely made me laugh as i tabbed between your description and each relevant character . 
  surprising , did n't know that . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'd love to see a map about how much speeding tickets cost in europe , perhaps we can finally beat finland at something then . 
  that sounds awfully pessimistic . 
  never heard of this ? 
  pretty much . 
  it 's just a nice story to me . 
  obviously , we are not supposed to project this positive story onto _ every single _ refugee/migrant , but neither should we do so with each negative one . 
  controversial !, 
  wait ... this is actual original content ? 
  yikes , those comments . 
  seems like a great family . 
  i did n't downvote you , but why do you think so if i may ask ? 
   the money australia spends , is money well spent . 
  obviously you did not look at the amount of people they have in their detention centres and how much it costs . 
  my point was that they are a subset of eastern europeans if we regard , for example , serbians as being eastern european , and they had quite a large role in the migrant crisis . 
   i 'm sure you also agree that those who illegally immigrated from northern africa no , i do not agree on this city . 
  not all of them come from libya . 
  a comparable situation would be to set up a city somewhere in kosovo and housing kosovars , serbians , albanians _ all _ in that same city . 
  obviously it will go wrong , it 's a disaster waiting to happen , just replace those groups with somalis , eritreans , libyans , different religious backgrounds and whatsoever . 
  this idea reeks of so much lack of foresight due to : - australia already having problems managing their tiny detention centres , so how can this city function when scaled up by multiple orders of magnitude . 
  - giving people ( who ? ), 
  in this city weapons will likely only bring problems , we all should know how much of an advantage this was to isis when we saw them taking over many iraqi and syrian weapon depots . 
  - no financial analysis whatsoever , definitely not at this scale . 
  i wonder if he even looked at the costs of the australian programme . 
  - putting syrians with different backgrounds in asylum seeker centres already gave us many problems ( rape , killings ) , now imagine putting all of these people from different backgrounds in one single city , in a war-torn country . 
  so no , i am not of the opinion that this is a _ solution _ , i believe it will bring only more problems . 
   til australia is an outdated country . 
  uh , yes , in that regard it is . 
  you do know it is very controversial due to rape , deaths and so on ? 
  glad we can agree on it . 
  obviously you have no fucking clue how much rape occurs in asylum centres here ( the netherlands ) as you , obviously , are not interested in hosting them , but even here it is already a shitshow . 
  now what happens once you move them to a place where there is even less oversight ? 
  it becomes more of a shitshow , _ obviously _ . 
  now australia does not have to deal with the same amount of migrants and they already have problems managing them . 
  now scale this up all the way to the size of some magic migrant city which apparently will have to host hundreds of thousands of them and imagine the chaos that will manifest . 
  and also , before coming up with such a blatant stupid idea , check how much australia spends on their tiny detention centres . 
  bigotry towards people from eastern europe , what kind of nonsense is this ? 
  just because someone disagrees with a point you make does n't mean he is a bigot due to your identity . 
  i 'll just have to add once more that you 're being quite the crybaby here . 
  it awfully comes close to _ very outdated _ practices for the lack of a better word . 
  `` we 'll just throw 'em here in this war-torn country , what could go wrong ?!, 
  bonus : we 'll give 'em weapons too !, 
  did anyone bother asking the people of libya ? '', 
  if not , it 's outright cunt-ish to consider libya to be some form of play-doh which you can turn into whatever you want it to be . 
   do the immigrate illegally ? 
  yeah , if i 'm right more than 100.000 illegal immigrants from the balkans came to germany . 
  [ kosovars , albanians , serbians and so on ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albania-kosovo-top-german-2015-asylum-seekers-list-01-07-2016 ) . 
   the right to travel and work freely . 
  that is not the case to my knowledge ? 
  certainly not just because a country is in the european union ? 
  for example croatia has restricted movement of its workers as austria , the netherlands , u.k. , malta and slovenia and have restricted them ( and vice versa ) from free movement of labor [ until 2018 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=1067&amp;langid=en ) . 
   that 's a form of bigotry , that you do n't consider eastern europeans to be equal europeans . 
  god , you just do n't get it do you ? 
  you consider _ me _ a bigot here the moment questions are raised about the libyan government ( s ) _ maybe _ not wanting your magic fantasy fucking city where islamic militants make the rules , and according to you , ** given weapons ** to secure _ migrant city _ and all will be well ? 
  you state that they will listen and take in people _ `` if given enough money '' _ . i ** clearly ** show you that hungary has no problem doing the same _ `` if given enough money '' _ and you accuse ** me ** of being a bigot . 
  you 're the bigot one with colonial thoughts here mate . 
  it has got to be the dumbest idea i have ever heard of with a billion ** ifs ** attached to it . 
  i am stating a fact that counters your point , it is not `` bigotry '' . 
  you suffer from some complex obviously . 
  just because i am critical of hungarian ** policy ** does ** not ** mean i dislike hungarian ** people ** . 
  it is not that hard to understand . 
  pathetic . 
  `` if we arm them against terrorists . '', 
  please , have you not seen enough footage of islamic militants taking over weapon depots ? 
  considering you give away european passports [ for the right sum of money ] ( http://m.imgur.com/a/vyng2 ) to africans , i think we can put hungary in the same category . 
  civil war ? 
  thirty to fourty year predictions ? 
  you actually believe this ? 
  i actually liked the look of [ this ] ( http://westermoskee.nl/wysiwyg/source/dsc_0315.jpg ) one when it comes to blending in , but find the minaret dominates the view too much . 
  indeed , seems like the obama administration will not go along with this . 
  if you have some ( more conservative ) muslim friends , ask them if _ all of it _ happens in slaughterhouses and they will tell you that even though it might not officially be allowed it still happens outside of them . 
  of course it could be enforced , fined and so on , so we 're on the same page !, 
  yes , there are laws of which i am not aware of , but that does not stop people from doing it apparently . 
  i have seen pictures of a cow 's neck being slit in celebration , so something does n't add up . 
  anecdotal , sure , but i do n't think it 's unheard of in the dutch muslim community . 
  yes , my first point , banning the religion , would be unconstitional . 
  the second point was that banning halal and kosher foods ( ritual slaughter ) is not unconstitutional on the grounds of animal welfare .
