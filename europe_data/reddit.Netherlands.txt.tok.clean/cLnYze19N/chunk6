   there are no systematical or structural disadvantages for men , women , blacks , whites or whoever in any european country . 
  you 're overstepping there by quite a bit . 
  i thought you were talking about the tabloid for a second . 
  he is referring to the npd . 
  wow , the subtitles are atrocious , but i would like to see a european army !, 
  thank you , that 's good news . 
  which borders did russia give away ? 
  i thought it was russia that was fond of [ snatching people near the border ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/19/russia-jails-estonian-police-officer-allegedly-abducted-border-eston-kohver ) ? 
  play stupid games , win stupid prizes . 
  [ good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8ivi0sz6f8 ) . 
  i see no reason as to why they should be lifted as nothing of significance has been done about the reason they were sanctioned in the first place . 
  it was an honest question out of interest . 
  ukraine today reported on it [ too ] ( http://uatoday.tv/news/ukraine-s-antonov-aviation-group-liquidated-578864.html ) i see and did manage to answer my question . 
  sounds good , but i thought antonov went bankrupt and was going to be dissolved ? 
  any ukrainians care to explain ? 
  seems [ some ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o1koijcmzx4/vmghuqi53ii/aaaaaaaajcm/z4fxtt9ycik/s1600/double%2b%25283%2529%2b%25281%2529.jpg ) are already on it , titled jihadidas . 
  i think he , thompson , was banned here quite some time ago . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll read up on it . 
  i had the feeling russian olympians were barely punished at all compared to their paralympians . 
  murdered by fifteen and sixteen year olds . 
  beyond sad that this still happens . 
  the age of the murderers is especially distressing . 
  were russian paralympians also included in the state-sponsored doping programme ? 
  they just feel like an easy scapegoat to me . 
  ouch , something geert wilders would strongly oppose , as he loves israel . 
  perhaps they wo n't become best friends after all . 
  looks like a fun guy . 
  what are your thoughts on your president portuguese ? 
  surprised me . 
  as if people from volendam were asked these questions . 
   he is in the same league as wilders ' pvv in netherlands . 
  wilders is quite off to the `` right '' with his [ recent call ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/politiek/wilders-partijprogramma-blijft-slechts-een-a4-tje~a4364551/ ) for a complete ban on the quran , so if he is in the same league , eh ... 
  does n't make any sense at all . 
  what kind of law-breakers ? 
  what is your problem ? 
  perhaps instead of countries we could go one level deeper and discriminate based on provinces or municipalities and make people thank _ province x _ or _ municipality y _ for providing housing , schools or whatever so we could include you . 
  you have a guy here that says `` i am austrian ! '', 
  and obviously is integrated well , and you 're going to be _ that _ little shit to tell him `` no , you are not ! '', 
  you set up shop in a country and you abide by that country its laws , so no , not `` their restaurant , their rules '' , when those rules are in conflict with the constitution . 
  yes , that [ seems ] ( http://wetten.overheid.nl/bwbr0001980/1999-04-01 ) to not be allowed . 
  honestly i 'd throw out anyone walking in naked or with a niq\u0101b , just common sense . 
  hijab is okay , but not seeing someone 's face makes many feel uncomfortable . 
  i think we almost had a ban on clothing that covers your face , not sure what happened to it . 
   no but it the country of the dutch people . 
  the `` dutch identity '' does not exist as maxima once put it . 
  as if your average person from amsterdam has so much in common with one from limburg or frisia . 
  who are you to decide who is or is not `` dutch '' enough ? 
  are surinamese ? 
  a certain germanic tribe from the past ? 
  indonesians ? 
  jews ? 
  all of those are intertwined in dutch history . 
  so , define `` dutch '' for me . 
   someone just shoot her already , ffs . 
  you might not agree with her views , but that is uncalled for and disgusting . 
  it 's not just _ your _ country bruv . 
   i 'm sure some people would prefer the police to be entirely white and male , but history has shown that 's a bad idea in britain . 
  that 's not true . 
  i 'm black and i do not approve of this , it is insane . 
  it is called a _ uniform _ for a reason . 
  not sure how that is supposed to be the problem of the consumer ? 
  maybe abide by the law and you do n't have to pay a fine ? 
  it was a serious question , although i have not been paying attention for some time now . 
  most european _ leaders _ will not say such things , while erdogan is more `` blunt '' in his views on europe . 
  certainly that is the case , no ? 
  you are right and i agree with you that the _ public _ or _ party leaders _ might be more outspoken about what they think or believe will do well among their base , but i doubt that any european _ leader _ , e.g. 
  merkel , cameron or hollande , will exile him - or herself politically by throwing out the same rhetoric erdogan uses . 
  i think most will refer to this as `` realpolitik '' . 
  since when are european _ leaders _ insulting erdogan ? 
  but then it does n't sound that tear-jerking !, 
  i will relay your opinion to the hive mind , lord blackness , so we can all be accepted for the harm some individuals have caused you . 
   blm is slow . 
  they 'll learn to stop blocking things during protest . 
  we taught them to read , now we will teach them to think before they act . 
  [ are you sure about that ? 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/disaffected-parents-to-blame-as-white-pupils-lag-behind-other-ethnicities-a6966981.html ), 
  if that 's the case that person was already racist to begin with , simple as that . 
  how do you think black people would view white people if that was the case ? 
  i can list many such events recently , but still , i will not generalize and project all of that on _ all _ white people . 
  how much historical shaming and material distribution do `` we '' have to endure ? 
  who is `` we '' first of all ? 
  second , stop pretending you are some victim . 
  perhaps not barring minorities from living where they wanted to live ( ghettoization ) would have prevented said marerial redistribution in the first place . 
  you are trying to find logic where there is none . 
  as farage kept saying , we 'll now respect the decision of those that voted leave so that they can `` cut off their nose to spite their face . '', 
   on topic : if what they say about leadsom being a religious nutjob , it 's very scary . 
  i watched the bbc debate and immediately had * that * feeling when looking at her eyes . 
  there was something off about her . 
  yes , that 's what i meant with * some * identity . 
  i doubt it is one that includes instead of excluding others . 
   take aghanistan . 
  their budget is being funded 40 % by the eu . 
  just a question , but where can i find that number ? 
  we have a facebook page for nexit now ? 
  that has not been established ? 
  do you * really * think you 're going to get a * better * deal after this ? 
  funny , was about to post something , decided not to , [ was confronted with this . 
  i disagreed with many of the things [ pim fortuyn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pim_fortuyn ) said , but he did die because of his views . 
  you can disagree with a politician 's views and not be heartless ?
