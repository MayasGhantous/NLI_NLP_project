  neither do i , i think the status quo we have in the netherlands is fine and i have no need to express my discontent for things in a way that does not fit our current legal framework . 
  haha , [ half of the dutch part is shared by a belgian from flanders ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgk40ykaltw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=790 ) , yet we will still catch all the flak for the * sch * and * g * sounds though . 
  i do not understand the fetish for nazism some of these fringe groups have in eastern europe . 
  if i recall correctly they were regarded as * untermenschen * . 
  it looks like one big joke to me , like dave chappelle playing a black guy being a member of the klu klux klan . 
  can someone who is more familiar with these people explain what their `` rationale '' is , if there is any ? 
  i am mad ? 
  we are all doing business with the kingdom of saudi-arabia . 
  that 's not a problem ? 
  hyperbole much ? 
  i do n't have to agree with their insane policies , we 're strictly talking oil here . 
  fact is iran is not funding seperatist parties all ovet europe or causing ruckus in eastern europe costing us billions of euros due to sanctions . 
  good . 
  at least iran is not destabilizing europe . 
  last i checked they were intending on buying european airbus planes for billions of euros too . 
   anyone who is serious about building muscle for example knows that it is impossible to get as big and ripped as those track runners , it is just impossible ( hardness of the muscle , the bodyfat percentage , the size of the muscles ) . 
  having been there , it is definitely not * impossible * to gain that amount of muscle and get your bodyfat down to those levels . 
  considering that the olympic athletes , track runners , are the cream of the crop , i am not surprised . 
  besides , athletes at times are banned for substances that do not even have a * dramatic * impact on performance . 
  it is anecdotal and * some * do notice a loss in sensitivity . 
  it was there to counter certain exaggerated claims . 
  i agree that consent in such a case is important , thus it can not be done at birth , but claims such as '' * emotional trauma * '' are just baloney . 
  `` psychological damage '' is false , even though i agree that the child should later on decide , but many here are exaggerating things to get their point across . 
  yeah , i 'm not sure why people are mostly going on about * mooslems * and so on here ... 
  that argument is indeed ridiculous . 
  a friend of mine * had * ( medical reasons ) to get it done at age 18 or so and said he did not notice any difference . 
  i do n't think it should be done without consent , but the exaggerated claims of `` it is brutal , mentally scarring and what not '' are simply not true . 
  seems most here are ignoring how common it is in the u.s. , it 's not just jews , muslims and so on ... 
  frankly , i completely agree with you on that and i am just nitpicking the way you worded it , but i doubt that many people here would say the same about some isis `` guard '' to be honest . 
  it sounds awfully apologetic . 
  ah , yeah the * double standard * that auschwitz employees have suffered from is something i truly hate too . 
  i did think about that and what you are referring to are * salami tactics * . 
  russia knows it can not bite off too much in one go and will push the united states , european union and nato as far as it can right now . 
  had russia pushed farther inwards with its military and * officially declared * it is engaging ukraine on its own soil , the repercussions would have been much more severe . 
  this is why they can only maintain their hybrid warfare in ukraine . 
  everybody * knows * russia is sending equipment across the border . 
  everybody * knows * putin is a liar when he claims there are no troops in ukraine . 
  the only people who will deny said things are part of russia 's weird [ ** proofs culture ** ] ( https://i.imgur.com/fyf1gew.png ) . 
  as to why donetsk and luhansk are not annexed ? 
  they are useful to russia as tools , just like crimea . 
  they will not turn crimea into a beautiful paradise . 
  from what i know it has actually been doing worse . 
  it is simply leverage to them in order to further their own interests . 
  i doubt they care about the people living there . 
  a country that spends [ * that * much on its military ] ( http://beta.data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs?end=2014&amp;locations=ru-us-nl&amp;start=2003 ) while poverty is rampant suddenly cares about the living standards of people in crimea ? 
  even after , you called the guy an `` idiot '' for mentioning his brother and wife suffer from that war . 
  i would look up the word * tact * if i were you . 
  you could have just left at it explaining why you made the joke and that you did not mean it that way . 
  [ like they do in crimea ? 
  ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-russia-crimean-tatar-tv-awaits-shutdown/26926613.html ), 
  i can not believe this guy actually * thinks * this is normal . 
  i just ca n't . 
  it just cracks me up and makes me sad at the same time . 
  they 'll always pop up after some horrific event . 
  i feel that these threads attract the weirdest trolls , justifying deportations , annexations and cleansings russia did the past century . 
  [ there even is one accusing the european union of * annexing * countries . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4oj22k/eu_extends_sanctions_on_russiaannexed_crimea/d4d0ytn ), 
  ah , yes , the * crimean tatars * should be ashamed of themselves . 
  you seem to love russia 's foreign policy . 
   it is shameful to pretend that a handful of ~ ~ vocal individuals from a select ethnicity ~ ~ russians set on segregating themselves from other ethnicities represent the population of a whole region . 
  this is what happened . 
  you have it the other way around . 
  russians segregate themselves in other lands , e.g. 
   my opinion is that if russia had n't been certain of crimeans desire to rejoin the federation well , they were not allowed to go in the first the place . 
  just because we have a lot of turks , moroccans living here does n't mean turkey or morocco gets dibs on dutch land . 
   the idea that russia is trying to restore its former empire and is attacking in all directions possible is just ridiculous and does n't hold under scrutiny . 
  so , which directions are there left ? 
  we 've had moldova , ukraine , georgia , a kidnapping in estonia , tensions with many other neighboring countries and many more incidents . 
  it seems to me that if russia sees the chance to nab something or increase their leverage in any other way , they will do so . 
  it is not a benevolent country . 
  i can not say much about that as it was not my claim . 
  it was a call to boycott and many did not vote from what i have read . 
  i would feel uncomfortable voting against * and * i would think that the numbers will be massaged by the occupier if the results contradict their wishes . 
  if a foreign country * lies * about their * military * being present at the polling stations , how reliable can the outcome of said referendum be ? 
  even though there was support , did anyone * really * expect russia would accept losing face in such a vote ? 
  there was n't even an option that would stick to the status quo in that referendum . 
  we are talking about the same hundreds of thousands of people that were forcibly removed and ethnically cleansed from crimea during stalin his time ? 
  are we talking about the same people that have inhabited crimea ever since people lived there ? 
  i am glad i am getting downvoted here . 
  i must be upsetting some people with * very * weird views on this issue . 
  it is shameful to treat any people who have given and shared this land with others in such a way , to insult them with a fake referendum after all the horrors is even more of an insult . 
  this is simply a repeat of previous russian cultural assimilation . 
  there is no need to be mad ? 
  i do not know how i would react in such a situation and neither do you . 
  no matter which way we look at it , the man was an accessory and was one of many parts that allowed auschwitz to function . 
  i am simply surprised that schwarzbaum seems to have accepted it for what it is instead of being filled with hate , and would rather have him educate others than spend the rest of his life in prison . 
  yeah , that 's what i mean , i find it impressive . 
  the emotions that man must have went through in his life in order not to give in to that . 
  i admire that . 
  i would just * understand * if he would be . 
   `` mr schwarzbaum added that he does not want hanning to go to prison and is happy that he apologised , but had hoped that he would provide more details about his time in auschwitz for the sake of educating younger generations . '', 
  that man has enjoyed a long and healthy life , something he helped take from so many that died . 
  how can you possibly `` forgive '' such a man . 
  i would understand if he was filled with absolute hate , but i assume schwarzbaum understands he is more of use by educating others on what happened ? 
  honest question , but why ? 
  i thought europe and the united states actually give them * a lot * of money compared to russia ? 
  i remember it was posted here a while ago , this was it : https://i.imgur.com/2cwj4ak.png, 
  well , you too , thanks . 
  i just do not agree with your point of view . 
  have a nice day .
