  i thought the crimean tatars boycotted the `` referendum '' , no ? 
  i do not think i have seen them laughing since the annexation . 
  thousands have died during this conflict and you call it `` bitching '' or `` whining '' , as if they have done nothing . 
  i am out !, 
   you do n't need to be on equal footing to fight back , taliban is n't on equal footing with west , but they have been fighting back for 15 years ( just for example , i do n't like taliban either ) a taliban-like existence , where predator drones point hellfire missiles at you day and night , is what you believe ukrainians should go for ? 
  it is futile , just look at the amount of people killed in afghanistan . 
  i am glad that ukraine is not beating its chest and trying to turn a hybrid war into an all-out war , resulting in more casualties . 
   and your point is . . ? 
  that `` taking back territory '' is not something you `` just '' do ? 
  if that is the case , then what is georgia doing ? 
  making it seem like the jews were on an equal footing and were `` fighting back '' is ridiculous . 
  they were saved from being entirely exterminated , which is what it was , only due to other global powers stopping germany . 
  i think we can all remember georgia 's glorious battle with russia , what a victory that was , huh ? 
  are you going to take that territory back too ? 
   its a game made by an american company lmao ... 
  it 's on the level of replacing a movie about martin luther king with matt damon though , even though i like matt damon . 
  you must looove minority report . 
  people from surinam , like typhoon , are linked to the netherlands ever since the 17th century . 
  he is not a `` foreigner '' , and he does n't need to show `` good behavior '' as if he 's some guest . 
  integration is a two way street where both sides need to be receptive . 
  the host country must be willing to integrate those and provide adequate means for those that are to be integrated into the country . 
  when we needed and brought in a lot of * gastarbeiders * the past century , the government expected most to eventually leave , i.e. 
  the italians and spanish , thus , unfortunately , did not put much effort into integrating those who decided to stay . 
  edit : / u/neohellpoet i have no intention of starting a reddit pen pal exchange with you . 
  you can reply to my message directly here . 
   no , it does not work that way . 
  integration is entirely the duty of the new arrival , especially ** when the new arrival was not invited to come ** . 
  what kind of a nonsensical worldview is it that some random strangers get to force you to adapt to a new set of difficult circumstances ? 
  do you know the word for new sets of difficult circumstances ? 
  the word is `` problem ''  if you want to help people , good on you , but there is no obligation on anyone except the immigrant to make sure they fit in . 
  ** they actually were invited by our government to come ** . 
  you live in some kind of utopia here where people would simply pick up the language by hearing others speak it . 
  people need to be able to learn the language for example , * that * is what i mean by helping those willing to integrate and starting a life in a new country . 
  if you think this just applies to moroccans this is simply false . 
  there are people from all backgrounds , polish , american and what have you that wanted to integrate here . 
  if we provide them the tools to do so then it gives them a much better shot at succeeding here . 
  it is mutually beneficial . 
  you 're making it seem as if i said that we should somehow concede liberties here and what not . 
  i am not saying that at all and would completely oppose that . 
  we helped out [ many refugees ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2013/26/ongeveer-5-900-kroaten-in-nederland ) from the balkans for example during the war , which i am sure you are well aware of ? 
  would you rather we would have made it more difficult for them by not helping them integrate whatsoever ? 
  i have this feeling you would think differently of that . 
  i think it does hurt the class . 
  it 's quite a waste of time to interrupt the class so that others can pray . 
  besides that , they 'd have to make exceptions for all religions . 
  that 's fair enough , yeah, 
  they would have to scale their servers if more people need to be served video content , there is a cost attached to that . 
  if it 's on youtube or any other third party website then you 're right , they would n't lose anything . 
  i agree with this when it comes to netflix limiting content in europe for example , but why should i have access to bbc content that i did not pay for ? 
  ah , not that i think it 's unlikely of him to say such a thing , i just wanted to verify it . 
  thanks :-), 
  thanks !, 
  i really wonder , it looks like some cheap wordpress blog and quickly googling it does n't give me any other sources to verify . 
  and how will we make this * drastic increase * of money appear ? 
  [ people on welfare in the netherlands ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2015/31/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand ) just look at the difference betweeen polish and syrians for example . 
  whatever economic miracle the author is expecting from refugees is n't going to happen . 
  we should be realistic . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph_l7pp_1mk ), 
  thank you !, 
  interesting , but indeed , only a union of countries without compassion would give turkey billions in euros to support those who are fleeing , while also taking in millions themselves and providing them with work and education . 
  if erdogan was doing * such * a wonderful job , they 'd stay in turkey instead of leaving for europe . 
   [ i know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20jcrk6jgfo )  [ we 're gon na smoke 'em out !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhoj_uwieym ) haha, 
  germany seems so conservative in some areas . 
  no gay marriage , which even ireland and the u.s. have . 
  do you have the entire transcript ? 
  you 're that salty ? 
   the dutch have stopped the process with a referendum . 
  this is very unlikely . 
  thank you !, 
  your language is interesting !, 
  it made me laugh :-), 
  not sure if german humor or ... 
  precisely . 
  i 'm black and banning `` colored people '' is just racist . 
  i 'm sure he could have been more nuanced if curry is that much of an issue . 
  big if true, 
  haha , no i am kind of clumsy when it comes to such things . 
  someone asked me to vote for mona keijzer ( cda ) and i voted for kees verhoeven ( d66 ) . 
   nothing motivates like a balding german guy in full cheerleader outfit . 
  haha , will you send the [ bavarians ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udjsbwbyape ) ? 
  i had two !, 
  i felt like i was going to knock over the booth while unfolding those things . 
   first past the pot i wish this was an actual dutch thing . 
  your comments managed to make me spit out my milk from laughing . 
  so you do n't want a leader , you just want a follower ? 
  visualizing leaders drawing straws and one of them getting putin gave me a good laugh . 
  no , `` we '' do n't . 
  haha , the `` jessiah '' , that 's hilarious . 
  they ... look like [ wentelteefjes ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=wentelteefjes&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch ) , one of my favorites . 
  welcome !, 
  hope it helped in understanding some of it . 
  i do n't know much about the situation in sweden , but i 'm sorry to hear about the xenophobia/racism , that 's awful , i can relate to that . 
  completely agree on the last point . 
  to see e.g. 
  kids being used for these activities and human trafficking also being part of it is beyond sad , so cooperation on combatting it is more than welcome . 
   oh how devastating it might be to see some poor people during your daily commute . 
  if your streets were n't riddled with professional begging/scam gangs before , then yes , it 's a bit sad . 
  i think you 're barking at the wrong tree here and i 'm not sure what you expect me to say ? 
  i voted in favor of the association agreement and tried to help out someone below who wanted to understand what 's happening here .
