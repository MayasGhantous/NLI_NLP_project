  good question !, 
  from what i gather , it now has to clear the upper house , which will most likely happen after the elections ( march 15th ) -- although the elections are for the lower house , so that should not affect it . 
  ** lower house ( tweede kamer ) ** it has 150 seats and for most things to pass a majority is needed ( 75 + 1 ) . 
  this was achieved by a coalition of vvd ( 40 ) , pvda ( 35 ) , d66 ( 12 ) , and gl ( 4 ) . 
  ** upper house ( eerste kamer ) ** it has 75 seats and for most things to pass a majority is also needed ( 38 ) . 
  currently the cabinet and parties that support it are vvd ( 13 ) , pvda ( 8 ) , d66 ( 10 ) and gl ( 4 ) , bringing the total up to 35 , so they are still lacking 3 for it to pass . 
  mark rutte , our prime minister , expects some cda senators in the upper house to also vote in favor , even though they voted against in the lower house . 
  party | [ seats in lower house ] ( https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerleden ) | [ seats in upper house ] ( https://www.eerstekamer.nl/fracties ) -- | -- | -- vvd ( people 's party for freedom and democracy ) | 40 | 13 d66 ( democrats ' 66 ) | 12 | 10 pvda ( labour party ) | 35 | 8 gl ( greenleft ) | 4 | 4 cda ( christian democratic appeal ) | 13 | 12 the cda 's view regarding the referendum on the association agreement can be found [ here ] ( https://www.cda.nl/standpunten/oekraine-referendum/ ) ( dutch , but i have translated it down below ) and it mentions the following :  in 2015 the cda voted in favor of the association agreement between the eu and ukraine , in the lower house as well as in the upper house . 
  this agreement should ensure good cooperation between europe and ukraine , where membership of the eu is not an option . 
   we also think this is a way of stimulating trade with ukraine , to combat corruption and build a stable rule of law . 
  in this way peace can be achieved at the borders of the european union , this will also be good for the netherlands . 
   ** referendum result ** the cda has always been against referendums . 
  however , a majority in the lower house has decided to make this possible . 
  on the 6th of april , 2016 , a referendum was held on the association agreement with ukraine . 
  we believe that the government can not disregard the result . 
  in a formal legal manner perhaps , but not in a democratic one . 
  the cda believes that the result of the referendum should be respected . 
  i think they -- or at least a couple -- will give in and will vote in favor , considering that they actually support the agreement itself . 
  wrong . 
  ah , this is really nice !, 
  ah , you misunderstood . 
  it was sarcasm , we 're on the same page !, 
  uhu , xenophobia/racism towards others , e.g. 
  koreans in japan is something that does not exist .

  it actually made me laugh while watching the movie , `` i am big ! '', 
  we can always move towards a bene ** de ** lux !, 
  funny , a guy here was telling me how the majority in the netherlands will be muslim in 2050 . 
  i do n't know about that .

  interesting . 
  thanks for answering and providing some insight !, 
  i would like to know too . 
  i thought france barely published any demographic data along the lines of religion and ethnicity ?

  i really like ukraine 's coat of arms . 
  the iranian one , while still cool , reminds me of a penguin with a moustache that misses its head . 
  we 're not talking about beating the soup with a spoon are we ? 
  what about this ? 
  i 'm on mobile , so i ca n't properly check it unfortunately .

   but turkish people pay for all of this . 
  i recall turkey receiving a lot ( billions ) of financial aid for these camps ? 
  i can hardly imagine turkey pays for all of this on its own ? 
  why is only half of his head shaved ? 
  post the statistics or keep quiet ? 
  i tried to even help you out at first , but you seem to be more interested in arguing about something as trivial whether lithuania has a population that exceeds two million . 
  `` total population is based on the de facto definition of population , which counts all ** residents ** regardless of legal status or citizenship . '', 
  otherwise , include a source that has your adjusted numbers ? 
  it clearly shows a drop in population of 800.000 from 1991-2015 .

   i 'm a ny'er , and going to the south is a bit of culture shock to me , with all the religious stuff everywhere . 
  haha , now imagine a dutch person that is non-religious going there . 
  i can respect my family 's religiousness on that side , they are very loving fortunately !, 
  what i really liked about georgia compared to the netherlands was that it felt so spacious , which might sound funny . 
  in the netherlands everything is very structured due to the lack of space and what space between villages and cities is left is mostly reserved for agricultural land , so i really did enjoy it !, 
  i would actually like to visit soon !, 
  my dad used to live in new york in his younger years . 
  he eventually moved to the netherlands due to being stationed here . 
  there 's actually a thread on / r/thenetherlands where people found out about [ the influence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flags_of_new_york_city#design ) our flag had on those in new york . 
  have a great evening !, 
  no , but fortunately i do get to visit every once in a while . 
  my family on that side lives in georgia , which i really like !, 
  whenever i come back i do realize that we indeed are a very tiny and densely populated country , so migration perhaps affects us more , especially as new arrivals tend to stick together . 
  i agree with what you 're saying , he was pandering . 
  he also made comments like that before . 
  `` not one penny towards greece ! '', 
  was one of the things he mentioned when the greek crisis was in full swing , which of course was a promise he could not keep . 
  :-) they ( vvd ) will probably lose quite some seats in the upcoming election according to the [ polls ] ( http://www.ipsos-nederland.nl/ipsos-politieke-barometer/barometer-van-deze-week ) , so that might explain the letter . 
   i was n't trying to insinuate that the netherlands are some kind of racist trashpit it really is not !, 
  my dad is african-american , so for me to say that rutte ( who wrote the letter ) is a very far cry from some politicians i have seen in the u.s. means something . 
  however , i am not sure if i understand . 
  trump has repeatedly tried to score political points by insulting many groups and calling for their deportation along the way , which so many people supposedly were fond of that they even voted him into office . 
  how could this letter be worse than that or what exactly do you think is unacceptable ? 
  the goal of the letter was a change in mentality . 
  definitely not to hint that people should be kicked out . 
  read this paragraph :  we should never view this as normal behavior in our country . 
  the solution is not to generalize , curse at or deport entire groups of people . 
  we can not build a society like that , can we ? 
  the solution primarily is a change in mentality . 
  we will have to be very clear on what is and what is not accepted in this country . 
  we will have to actively defend our values . 
  in some ways he indeed seems to insinuate immigrants , but not muslims directly , being the cause of these problems . 
  although most dutch people realize he is trying to win votes from the partij voor de vrijheid ( freedom party ) led by geert wilders as they are doing great in the polls . 
  surprisingly , the same day that letter was posted , some of his party members were found to have lied to our house of representatives ( tweede kamer ) a while ago when they were questioned . 
  so much for that change in mentality and `` values '' we have to protect . 
   i could n't believe it yesterday when trump sent a letter to the entire country that strongly hinted that if muslims could n't start acting `` normal , '' they should leave the country . 
  which letter is this ? 
  if you are talking about the dutch prime-minister , you have been reading a very bad translation . 
   every other nation has a normal common name ... holland \uff08 \u256f \u00b0 \u25a1 \u00b0 \uff09 \u256f \u253b \u2501 \u253b,
