  yes , the quoted text is what i said . 
  we ca n't know whose side they 're on before we do our vetting and our research . 
  until then , we ca n't assume that their intentions are good . 
  i never said that . 
  of course not every muslim must be held accountable . 
  wanting to kill innocent westerners . 
  we should n't assume that every refugee wants to do this , because that 's simply and obviously not the case , but we have to . 
  does n't count as european to me , sorry . 
  so how about we demand the existing powers take action against the scum that 's doing these things ? 
  this is how states descend into anarchy . 
  if we 're not careful , turkey will be the next iran . 
  so let 's not be stupid , and let 's make sure erdogan is removed in a way that will not cause chaos . 
  whose feet are we talking about here ? 
  that 's kind of the point . 
  terrorists , like bullies , need and expect you to hate them . 
  good job !, 
  now we just make sure the rest of the first world , and europe in particular , does the same . 
  yes . 
  all religions . 
  every religion has the potential to inspire hate and violence . 
  [ i took a similar one just last week ] ( http://i.imgur.com/basfeqo.jpg ) . 
  yeah but sweden is not really a great example i think . 
  they have like one building that 's taller than ours , the rest 's all much smaller . 
  that picture makes me happy . 
  rotterdam sure is trying though , are n't they ? 
  hmm yea, 
  by that metric , i believe we have exactly 6 skyscrapers , and 3 more under construction . 
  oh shit , really ? 
  damn , we should have built that mountain when we had the chance . 
  though the giant spinning circular skyscraper idea is pretty cool too . 
  though maybe we should just build a wall of towers in utecht or almere or something . 
  fill some holes in rotterdam too . 
  i 'm counting it . 
  it 's going to be there soon anyway . 
  i 'd rather be right in a few years than right now . 
  there 's just something about 215m that makes it so much cooler than 164m . 
  i think we 're doing pretty well for the relatively small and insignificant nation that we are . 
  not to suggest that we 're actually all that insignificant , of course . 
  yes , structures do not count as skyscrapers . 
  or buildings at all , for that matter . 
  so the tallest one we 've got now , though perhaps i 'm a bit premature in saying that , is the zalmhaventoren at 215m . 
  that number has been , and is growing exponentially . 
  i think it 's a pretty cool things to keep track of . 
  while only had a couple of them in the 1980s , that number had quadrupled by the year 2000 , and by 2010 the rate at which these buildings were being built had once again been multiplied by several times . 
  at this point , several of these towers are being built every year . 
  it 's quite exciting if you like a bit of height . 
  to american or asian ears it may sound comical but yes , we do have quite a few of these skyscrapers in the netherlands . 
  would n't expect any different in pennsylvania . 
  just today i argued that this there is a god , she 's probably a sassy , black , lesbian woman . 
  but that 's irrelevant , because there ca n't be . 
  no one is that big a cunt . 
  me too . 
  christ , not again . 
  but who 's going to pay for it ? 
  if only we would stop doing that . 
  i think she is pretty clear about that nowadays - she is not a turk , nor does she have any sympathy for the turkish authorities . 
  little late to be saying that is n't it ? 
  and that could n't be negotiated through the international courts or something ? 
  is n't there an authority higher than turkey itself that could officially revoke citizenships ? 
  i 've actually seen people in / r/thenetherlands asking if destroying their turkish passport would be binding . 
  it 's time we shut down erdgodan 's responsibility for a nato country . 
  they 're old , and what 's more , they 're really old . 
  and not good old like the utrecht trams or the ddm double decker trains . 
  and they look stupid with their glued-on noses , their slanted front windows , and the nasty yellowed white/red livery . 
  seriously , the livery is boring even by 1981 standards . 
  no idea sorry . 
  but the sooner the old ones will be gone , the better . 
  i did hear that maastricht 's going to get a tram in the coming years , which i suppose is more important . 
  says the glorified german . 
  dutch more confrontational than americans ? 
  this chart is grossly inaccurate in so many ways .

  rode on this in 2011/2012 , it was pretty cool . 
  hear they have new trains now . 
  how would i know ? 
  i do n't know any better than to think you 're all the same . 
  it 's still true . 
  we 're a people of business . 
  does n't matter what kind . 
  it 's culture that matters , moreso than geographic location . 
  what about a relationship with a gay person tho ? 
  are you defending the cockroaches ? 
  and it damn well should . 
  war or not , they 're not supposed to be here and they 're definitely not supposed to be getting aid in coming here . 
  if they must , let them do it by themselves . 
  then , perhaps , we can evaluate whether they 're welcome or not . 
  we 're going to need a bigger wall . 
  but you can bet they 'd let my white ass in . 
  that 's a real shame . 
  and they did n't even build a crapton of skyscrapers in it like we did with our bombed city . 
  where 's my rivella ? 
  uh ... what ? 
  ... we 're gon na have to build a wall . 
  inside the wall , a billion people in paradise ; outside the wall , 9 billion africans . 
  so yeah , that 's my town . 
  i 've seen better pictures of it though ... 
  maybe macron is the adapter that allows trump to plug into europe . 
   or is it simply you believe that your liberal `` western '' values are the correct one and ones that everyone needs to bow to and follow ?
