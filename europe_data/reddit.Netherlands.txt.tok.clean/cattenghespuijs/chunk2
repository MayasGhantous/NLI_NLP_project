  first time i 'm voting, 
  haha now see the one from this year . 
  sp is just more extreme ( anti '' `` elite '' '' , anti-eu ( but not nexit afaik ) , middle/upper class should pay for everything ) . 
  i ca n't speak about france , but de volkskrant did some research into the [ `` 9/11 generation '' ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/politiek/zo-stemmen-de-kinderen-van-9-11~a4469840/ ) . 
  we have been growing up with more terrorism and polarisation . 
  new york , madrid , london , pim fortuyn , theo van gogh and more recently paris , nice , brussels , berlin . 
  along with that , endless migration streams means more questions around jobs , values , traditions . 
  but , unlike what happened after brexit , we should n't necessarily consider our generation as better than the old people . 
  18-25yo often do n't care about politics that much etc. 
  i think many parties are going slightly up , meaning the fight for first place might happen between more than just pvv and vvd . 
  but i just want to say , rutte ( and the vvd in general ) is n't avoiding press at all . 
  since that debate rutte has gone to a few cities , zijlstra has been on jinek/pauw and on npo radio1 and they wo n't miss the upcoming debates . 
  i do n't know if you intentionally interpreted the op that way , because it 's just not true for the vvd . 
  wait , is this bad ? 
  we * always * eat a salad ( or other vegetables ) with pasta . 
   if you 're so desperate that you have to misrepresent something so desperately to try to make a point than you 're pathetic and default lose any argument . 
  something something covering up migrant crime ? 
  the way the eu has operated lately has created a climate where you either comply or get in trouble . 
  it manifests itself in political parties . 
  well , austrians got what they voted for huh . 
  atleast they did n't get evil right wing candidate , that would have been disastrous . 
  schultz would be worse so not that bad . 
  you said x-axis , but i think you mean what is normally referred to as the y-axis . 
  who the fuck cares what tanzania or nicaragua think about russia , while we are left out ? 
  yes . 
  yes , but that 's despite the fact that there are more immigrants , not because of it . 
  no the right is not corrupt . 
  it is merely exposing the lies we have been told and in the last few years their intentions have become [ very clear ] ( https://vid.me/0q72 ) . 
  the right will do anything to change the course the eu and europe is taking . 
  no shit . 
  every extremist is loyal to their ideology . 
  even if it did , it would n't be bad . 
  we need to stop this ( no , not the mayor or his comments ) . 
  up until the point where we are replaced and cease to be secular . 
  lack of exposure hahaha . 
  exposure is what made me a nationalist . 
  maybe in bosnia , but that 's not what we 're talking about, 
  so what do you have to say about specific nationalities of which  70 % is receiving welfare checks ? 
  are they equal too ? 
  no , and if that group increases it would mean the end of the european welfare state system . 
  do you claim that indonesia is a country other countries should go after ? 
  `` extremists '' have so much power there they won the election in jakarta , and push for the trial of the former governor for blasphemy . 
  there . 
  exemplary . 
  muslim . 
  country . 
  you 'd have to put cameras everywhere too then . 
  much too easy to lie your way through shit ( taqiyya comes in handy ) just like so many african immigrants have been doing . 
  we joke a lot about belgians and germans ( history , language , stereotypes ) and i think most countries do that with their neighbours . 
  the fun thing about such small nations for me is that in school trips you can take a short trip to the border and be in a very different country . 
  but historically countries were very different so you can see old churches , castles and remnants of the roman empire spread around europe . 
  huh ? 
  how can this be when there are no gay people in chechnya ? 
  at this point , it 's just a local, 
   not realizing he was being sarcastic  eu flair * sigh * when will people learn ? 
  okay , that could be a good reason . 
  but le pen can also work like wilders did in our country . 
  he wo n't govern , but if he was n't there , the politicians would n't bother dealing with all kinds of problems . 
  it allows a more moderate candidate to follow her , but maybe not go as far . 
  i have been hearing this exact thing since 2015 . 
  since then ** hundreds ** of people have died because of muslims in europe . 
  not to mention all kinds of other troubles they have been causing . 
  at what point are you going to realise you ca n't just designate some neighbourhoods for them and hope it can be contained ? 
  i have been hearing this exact thing since 2015 . 
  i 'm not advocating for le pen , i do n't know her , but since then ** hundreds ** of people have died because of muslims in europe . 
  at what point are you going to realize you 're just looking away from the problem ? 
  i 'd rather be a fascist than let that happen to this continent, 
  [ `` islam and the western values are not excluding eachother . 
  we must learn from eachother , and * combine * our values and our views '' - martin schultz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjuugawvdg8 ) cnn why did you give me this guy, 
  such an ambiguous question . 
  no source either , so why are we discussing this ? 
  ha , but really you can be sort of fit even if you just do sport 2x 20mins . 
  also , i guess gymnastics in elementary school does n't count , i had 2 hours of gymnastics each week . 
  boys/girls ( 4-12 ) here spend even amount of time on sport activities , but 30 % of boys is above the fitnorm , compared to 7 % of girls . 
  fitnorm definition : intensive physical activities for at least 20 minutes for at least 3 times per week . 
  this is because boys do more intensive sports such as football and judo . 
  banana curry is all the rage now, 
  next up : fat acceptance on the rise . 
  half way into making a decent crape nice french john, 
  you ca n't even read more than half a sentence , why bother with you, 
  i have nothing against people wanting to educate themselves , but if you take education ( and yourself ) seriously you do n't use a random youtuber as your source material . 
  it 's science ( or another complex topic ) made easily digestible so that dumb people can think they are smart . 
  i would appreciate it if they knew , and i think it is good manners to not expect someone to speak/understand your language , but i would n't get annoyed if they did n't . 
  france alpes . 
  next to us were two british boys and we had a lot of fun playing , but i barely knew any english at the time . 
  i remember standing on a 1m cliff telling them to `` jump '' ( jumpstyle ) and instead of dancing they jumped down :'), 
  how is a tourist going to know [ local language ] ? 
  that 's normal  [ tanning bed ] ( http://www.comodynes.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ambitionc.jpg ), 
  socialism would n't work in america . 
  i would n't want to pay taxes for welfare nigs . 
  when i went on my school trip , we were cautioned there were a lot of migrants trying to steal/sexually assault you/offer you souvenirs for 1 euro . 
  the reality was n't far of .
