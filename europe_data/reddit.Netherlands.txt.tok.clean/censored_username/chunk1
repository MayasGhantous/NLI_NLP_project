maybe in some other countries , but france ? 
  certainly not . 
  france has been part of the eu since its beginning , and was one of the core members of the first european communities . 
  it is counted as one of the founding states together with belgium , west germany , italy , luxembourg , and the netherlands . 
  it certainly is n't one of the most eurosceptic nations of the union . 
  you should know that english literacy in the netherlands is above 90 % . 
  even without knowing any dutch you can get around in the netherlands pretty easy as long as you know english . 
  and if you already know german , dutch is not hard to learn at all . 
   it 's language , people and countryside are really beautiful i get the people and countryside but how the hell is our language beautiful . 
  we sound like we 're trying to torture our own throats . 
  that 's a stupid argument . 
  173 ( 189 newer count ) of my countrymen died and i 'll still say that revenge wo n't get us anywhere anyway . 
  you ca n't bring back the dead , you can only cause more suffering that way . 
  lowering yourself to the level of those you detest is a good way of becoming what you say you hate yourself . 
  rarely in all our recorded history has an eye for an eye helped anything . 
  dutch can join in here too . 
  ** kindercarnavalsoptochtvoorbereidingswerkzaamheden ** ( perparation work for the child carnaval convoy ) or an often-abused example : ** hottentottententententoonstellingsterrein ** ( exhibition ground for hottentot tents ), 
  problem with that is that many eu countries have laws which say you have to be in that country to request asylum . 
  i wonder if he could now go to the embassies of the countries in question and try this . 
  ( translated : it 's the time of cucumbers . 
  go figure ) it 's also pretty hot here still . 
  been in london for a week but that did n't help either . 
  it 's actually fairly simple . 
  the wind was reaching speeds of 100 kph yesterday , and aircraft tend to land between 200 and 300 kph . 
  if the wind is then angled with respect to the track , it means that the plane has to maneuver itself at an angle with respect to the track in order to hit the track straight-on . 
  anyway , regarding the forces on the wing , realize a few things . 
  1 . the lift generated by a wing scales quadratic with the air speed over the wing . 
  2 . the wings are significantly swept backwards . 
  this means that the wind direction can be perpendicular to one wing , while almost parallel to the other wing . 
  3 . the force exerted by the air on the aircraft is in the same scale as the weight of the aircraft . 
  `` it 's heavy '' is not really a factor . 
  basically , what can happen is that the wind causes massive differences in the lift generated by the two wings . 
  if one wing experiences an airflow of 200kph and the other wing an airflow of 140 kph , that means that the second wing is only generating about half the lift of the first wing . 
  that is a quarter of the total lift of the craft trying to flip the airplane on its side . 
  the pilots have to correct for this using the ailerons . 
  you might be underestimating the amount of control the pilots have over the craft . 
  the forces that can be generated using the control surfaces of the aircraft are massive . 
  most airframes are designed in order to cope with g loads between 2.5 and -1 . 
  you can operate most aircraft with only one engine running or half a wing ripped off . 
  there is no wind at all today . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 'll be okay . 
  a big problem for schiphol is that the wind can basically come from any direction around here . 
  there are no defining geographical features or common patterns really . 
  this is also one of the reasons schiphol has 5 different runways , with only two going in the same direction . 
  usually only two are in use , either due to wind conditions or to minimize noise pollution in the area . 
  seriously though , the wind at schiphol yesterday was pretty insane . 
  in the area there were problems with trees falling over due to the wind . 
  i promise you that we 're only building it to fight the sea . 
  we totally do not have any other uses for it once we 've claimed our victory ( and we 're totally not planning on connecting the uk to the mainland just to piss them off ) . 
  normal dutch vowels a e i o u aa ee oo uu ai oi ui ei au ou ie oe eu ij uw aai ooi oei auw ouw eeuw ieuw rarely used : loanwords / names / old dutch spelling y \u00e8 \u00ea \u00e9 ae ay ey uy oy aay aij aei aey eau eij oey ooy oij uij aaij aeij eaux oeij ooij this gets rather confusing, 
  this has nothing to do with either fascism or socialism . . 
  that would n't be pissing everyone off . 
  pissing everyone off would involve being in a trade agreement , not liking the responsibilities everyone has in it , leaving it , and then trying to get a trade agreement without the responsibilities everyone else has . 
  what makes you think they 'd want to have such an agreement . 
  also the fact that something is legal does n't mean everyone is going to be happy with it . 
  because those relations would still be fully intact and the other countries would conveniently forget that this way you basically want to get the benefits without the responsibilities ? 
  you do n't get to both piss off and rely on the other countries at the same time . 
   what if a lead-encased uranium core is in there ? 
  how the hell would a lead-encased thing make it through customs without being detected . 
  it 'd show up on all types of scanners , and be ridiculously heavy . 
  that 'd be ridiculous . 
   or may viruses survive a detonation ? 
  there 'd be way easier ways . 
  like getting infected with it and flying during the incubation time . 
  for some reason nobody seems to do this though . 
  might be related with the fact that you 'd also suffer from it . 
   turks should face the consequences for this incident . 
  what consequences ? 
  they fired on a foreign armed military aircraft after it entered their airspace after repeated warnings to not enter it . 
  while the reaction might be seen as out of proportion they had all rights to do so . 
  do n't enter foreign airspace unauthorized unless you 're prepared to be shot at . 
  that has always been the case with aircraft . 
  looking at the polls , our political spectrum is currently so divided that at least 4 parties are necessary to form a coalition if elections were held right now , and this would be wonky as hell coalition of 2 right and 2 left wing parties , unless they want to risk vvd/cda/pvv / sgp which would give them a 1 seat majority while having to negotiate with the pvv which has quite the precedent of being impossible . 
  while the vvd and cda are practically guaranteed at current numbers the other two parties would have to be d66/gl/sp . 
  at that point we might just well give up on a coalition as gl and sp hardly ever agree on something with the vvd . 
  your link is broken . 
  i do n't think anyone but the uk themselves will have a problem witha norwegian style deal . 
  after all it basically means unconditionally accepting a shit ton of eu regulation without actually getting any voting rights . 
  for the uk it 'd basically be a worse version of the deal they have currently though so i 've got no idea why they 'd do that . 
  as a dutchie with a drivers license : this is bullshit . 
  as a driver in the netherlands there just is n't any way you can forget that there are cyclists all around and you just have to look in your mirrors before you open your doors . 
  the latest changes are promising though . 
  currently the netherlands is building a section of offshore wind parks with a cost goal of 0.0727 euro/kwh , for an average of 700 mw power input ( about 4.3 % of dutch power usage ) . 
  this is windpark borsselen i & ii . 
  expansion of this windpark is planned which should at least double this capacity . 
  if they can realize this cost goal it could start to get competitive . 
   just seems an incredible expense for nature reserves while we 're struggling with a $ 4 billion deficit . 
  well the thing was , we have to dredge those waters anyway , as they keep gathering more sand . 
  and we have to put that sand somewhere . 
  by far the easiest turned out to be to just put it in one location in the water and just build an island . 
  lowest transport costs , everything can just be done by boats . 
  besides , if we ever were to build such a wall we 'd just build it right through you guys and claim flanders for the king . 
  yep . 
  we had too much sand over from dredging . 
  this was one of the better uses people could think of . 
  we 've had areas below sea level for hundreds of years now . 
  they 've always been in danger , even without the sea level rising . 
  in the previous century several large floods occurred due to large storms , which prompted the construction of several huge infrastructure projects ( most predominantly the [ deltaworks ] ( http://www.deltawerken.com/deltaworks/23.html ) ) which allow us to close off the big inland rivers from the sea if the sea level rises due to storms . 
  still , improvements will probably have to be made with the predicted amounts of sea level rise . 
  but do n't forget , we already have parts of the country that are 5m below sea level .
