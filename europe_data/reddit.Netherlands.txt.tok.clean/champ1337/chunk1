i still do n't understand these ridiculous names . 
  regional governments just love wasting tons of cash on impractical new fancy buildings . 
  [ st pancras ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/st_pancras_railway_station_2012-06-23.jpg ) in london is still the prettiest station i have ever been to . 
  this is why irish coffee is the best , shame its a lot of effort to make while drunk . 
  it 's still 5 % alcohol right ? 
  this does n't change the fact that there never should have been commercial aircraft 's flying over a war zone . 
  i agree , ukraine should have closed its airspace if there is a war going on . 
  tupac alive in serbia , tupac making album of serbia . 
  except there were no cases of voting violence cases reported of-course . 
  no one stops anyone folding up . 
  it 's to late now , this will probably end up ignored . 
  [ new footage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvl7_ngondo ) looks like a atgm strike to me .

  liveuamap is meh , it is very biased . 
  the map usually does not look like other maps . 
  examples : http://eurasianunion.ch/centralasia/var/albums/maps/ua/2014/08/27/lnr-full-frontline-27_8_2014.jpg?m=1409147217 http://eurasianunion.ch/centralasia/var/albums/maps/ua/2014/08/27/dnr-full-frontlines-27_8_2014.jpg?m=1409147211 https://twitter.com/fpwatcher/status/504863710297718784 also , why does it show chechenya and dagestan as separate entities ? 
  i heard scythia wants crimea back . 
  to be fair , we dutch are naturally fairly tall . 
  read the linked comment , i find it disgusting how much wehrmacht apologia there is in the comments . 
  the movie has nothing to do with it . 
  the clean wehrmacht myth has to die . 
  we are discussing the video vortalwombat posted right ? 
  because boilerbuttslut used past tense referring to the nazi video ? 
  no idea , i should have also mentioned all the other `` untermenschen '', 
  children are not able to make decisions for their own , they should be excused of course . 
  fighting for the nazi 's should result in jail , if they committed war crimes execution is a fitting punishment . 
  did you forget that they wanted to kill all slavs ? 
  regular guys who wish to kill jews , slavs , ect . 
  they are nazi scum , they deserved it . 
  just look at all those nice wehrmacht soldiers !,

  i am not ashamed of it . 
  ca n't shame me for something i did n't do . 
  says a turk , forgot about the ottoman empire already ? 
  allegedly . 
  ah , i am mistaken , germany did as a matter of a fact did not catch up to the british during the [ anglo-german naval arms race . ], 
  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-german_naval_arms_race ), 
  thats what the british said some 125 years ago , no one will ever have a larger navy than them !, 
  but look what happened ? 
  the new rising powers ( u.s ) ( germany ) overtook them !, 
  hmm , maybe . 
  it was a long time ago . 
  i did not go to any country , they were done at the school where i would normally go to . 
  i dunno how to call them in english , but you in dutch they are called `` tussenuren '' you know those hours where you normally have class but they got cancelled ? 
  i must have done a different erasmus program than you guys , mine consisted of dry theory during spare school hours . 
  will it be even more negative ? 
  nope . 
  [ another advantage of minsk metros ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yhvpxjr.jpg ), 
  is sadism correct ? 
  they really picked the worst map they could pick for this . 
  i thought it was a celebration of kicking the british ~ ~ and irish ~ ~ out ? 
  you quote is a bit misleading , it should be along the lines of : `` i believe our aim today must be to create a unified ~ ~ europe ~ ~ market from lisbon to vladivostok . '', 
  contents of the memorandum , according to the memorandum , russia , the u.s. , and the uk confirmed , in recognition of ukraine becoming party to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and in effect abandoning its nuclear arsenal to russia , that they would : * respect ukrainian independence and sovereignty within its existing borders . 
  * refrain from the threat or use of force against ukraine . 
  * refrain from using economic pressure on ukraine in order to influence its politics . 
  * seek united nations security council action if nuclear weapons are used against ukraine . 
  * refrain from the use of nuclear arms against ukraine . 
  * consult with one another if questions arise regarding these commitments . 
  russia broke three of these points , in response the last point was executed , this did nothing . 
  the treaty was effectively useless to begin with . 
  no countries had any fear of breaking these obligations because of a very weak response if the treaty is broken . 
  europe stretches from the atlantic sea to the ural mountains , east of the urals is asia . 
  estonia is technically not even nordic see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_countries http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:nordic_countries.svg, 
  why ? 
  [ here is a map i just made . ], 
  since when is russia not europe ? 
  the problem is that it was a piece of the local crimean museum , they technically still own it . 
  would n't it be theft to not return it ? 
  could i ask you a question ? 
  what is the popular opinion of people in japan on the ukraine crisis ? 
  is it even discussed ? 
  demands from poroshenko for the trilateral peace talks going on right now . 
  i would guess . 
  why ? 
  holy european empire , only this time the hapsburg can bugger off . 
  just saw my mistake . 
  in case you missed it , luhanks and ~ ~ odessa ~ ~ donetsk is a warzone right now . 
  i doubt anyone is going to protest with artillery firing on them . 
  edit :, 
  i am sorry , but that is just not true . 
  here are 4 protests i found by just googling for a couple of minutes : [ odessa , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_37t6hfwspe ) [ donbass , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=fievk27-5om ) [ more odessa , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pixmvoli6li ) [ kharkov . ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pixmvoli6li ), 
  it is still debatable how many of the fighters are actually foreigners , because there is local support . 
  here are miners in a peaceful protest for example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_q3fafiois [ these are the same miners that threathen to turn violent and take up arms ] ( http://ukraineantifascistsolidarity.wordpress.com/2014/06/19/donetsk-miners-give-kiev-48h-ultimatum-stop-war-or-we-will-take-up-arms/ ) i have heard estimates from 80 % local and 20 % foreign to 50-50 , its guessing work . 
  i do not want a restoration of the warsaw pact , the russians would love to have it back of-course . 
  i never said that i actually would support all of the things i mentioned . 
   the reason why russia need a large buffer zone is because it has always been expansionist . 
  i do n't quite follow you here , are you saying that the objective ( a buffer zone ) is caused by the means ( expansionism ) ? 
   it was russia who was an invader for all of their history so they could get their buffer zone , or colonies to the east . 
   are you asking us to become their puppet states again ? 
  of-course not , i am not saying the it should happen , or that it is moral , or that i would want it . 
  every nation acts in their own interest . 
  when russia and germany are weak , poland becomes strong like during the polish-lithuanian commonwealth ( your nation invaded russia once too ) . 
  same goes inverted , like in ww2 . 
  i would argue that nato has always been hostile towards russia with a brief intermission after the fall of the soviet union , i agree that russia is not entitled to control these smaller nations . 
  [ take a look at this elevation map of europe ] ( http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/elevation-map-of-europe/europeelevation.eps/image_original ) you can clearly see the northern european plain , now if an hostile coalition would attack including ukraine it would have many possibilities [ see this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sitj505.jpg ) . 
  if russia pushes west the less options a [ western coalition would have ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uf8ooc0.jpg ) . 
  this however does not mean that they should own the territory , allies or puppet states would be enough ( like the warsaw pact ) . 
  ( grey indicates northern european plain on the last 2 maps ), 
  the reason why russia has always been expansionist is * because * the need a large buffer zone , and the reason they need a large buffer zone is so they can expel invaders .
