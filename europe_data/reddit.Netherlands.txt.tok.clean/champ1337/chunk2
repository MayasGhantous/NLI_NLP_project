  see napoleon and nazi germany , now if they had a buffer zone the size of nowadays they would have lost for sure . 
  see a map of [ 1812 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/europe_in_1812.png ) , and a map of [ 1940 ] ( http://www.ushmm.org/lcmedia/map/lc/image/eur11950.gif ) . 
  belgium is a small country with larger neighbours , their best bet at survival is to either ally ( see nato ) or to stay neutral ( which failed in ww1 and ww2 ) . 
  belgium also has the [ ardennen ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/ardennen03.png ) which protects walloon . 
  any attempts at expansion will be crushed by their much stronger neighbours . 
  the reason that they need a large buffer zone is because of the central european plain , the are almost no natural obstacles going all the way to the ural mountains . 
  isis crucifies people . 
  lets just call it what it is , a contested border . 
  it should be indicated as such , google maps acknowledges it . 
  `` war gives the right of the conquerors to impose any conditions they please upon the vanquished . '', 
  - julius ceasar they straight up lost , they can deal with it . 
  or they can stick their head in the ground and pretend nothing happened . 
  same counts for you . 
  that is because the us did n't annex it , russia however did annex crimea . 
  probably a old map . 
  genocide olympics are the most useless thing ever . 
  is it `` on this tread '' or `` in this thread '' ? 
  i know it 's churchill 's quote mate , calm down . 
  democracy is a shitty system , but it is the best shitty system we have . 
  without the bankers , the whole financial system comes crashing down . 
  entering a third crisis . 
  the russians also have a second line of defense , behind the ural mountains . 
   i say we have every country surrounding them join nato that would cause some big problems , and is nearly impossible . 
  do you really think china would join nato ? 
  or belarus ? 
  or kazakhstan ? 
  georgia can not possibly join nato because of border disputes , same goes for ukraine . 
   1/3 of russians still believe the sun revolves around the earth . 
  i hope this is sarcasm . 
  russia has more possibility to diversify its import . 
  most likely embargoes , or increased tariffs , economic warfare in general . 
  [ this guy gave a great response concerning russia and homosexuality in a older thread . ],

  you should work at the foreign affairs department . 
  osce has confirmed that it was indeed a airstrike carried out by a ukranian jet , osce.org is down atm . 
  but there is an rt article on this . 
  http://rt.com/news/163352-ukraine-airstrike-lugansk-missiles/ `` the osce ukrainian mission 's daily report stated that `` on june 2 , around 15:00 local time missiles hit the building of the regional government administration . 
  according to the observers ' data , the strike was carried out with non-guided missiles launched from an aircraft . '' '', 
  i have to admit that the americans thoroughly kicked ass in the kuwait conflict . 
  yes the had a lot of tanks , however they were outdated compared to the american tanks . 
  especially the optics , american tanks were still able to fire even with a lot of dust and smoke , iraqi tanks however could not . 
  i would recommend [ this briefing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wki3nwlfkx4 ) for everyone . 
  its so informative . 
  i would say that tanks are less useful in civil wars like ukraine and syria because of civilian fire , you also flatten your own city . 
  however in scenarios like the gulf war they are extremely useful . 
   the weather is n't bad . 
  looks like you got lucky , i was completely soaked this morning . 
  serbians are very proud of nikola tesla .

  ah hungary , always trying to revise trianon . 
  i would be okay with a competition on who can help the most people . 
  people give putin a lot of shit for his foreign policy , but he sure made a lot of good economic reforms , see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:russian_economy_since_fall_of_soviet_union.png http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:russiaunemployment.png http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:russian_public_debt.jpg, 
  [ they say that a lot . ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gro9lpjgp_m&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m57s ), 
  excellent article . 
  they should have sent [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcy68cwdkve ) and they would have won for sure . 
  i do not support the soviet union 's actions . 
  you might indeed find it tasty , just like some people like to talk while eating . 
  both are found disgusting by people whom you are eating with . 
  would you still eat salad with nutella in-front of a group with the sole purpose of provoking a reaction ? 
  way to go , classify anyone with a different view on things a secret agent or a idiot . 
  how about you say something something actually proving the statement above instead of ad hominem attacks . 
  hitler was ** not ** democratically elected . 
  he never received a majority of the vote of the german people . 
  in 1932 hitler challenged von hindenburg for president of germany , [ but lost ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_presidential_election,_1932#results ) . 
  in the first round of voting von hindenburg got 49.6 % of the vote , hitler got 30.1 % , and ernst th\u00e4lmann of the communist party got 13.2 % . 
  since no candidate had received a majority , a second round of elections was held , with hitler again losing to von hindenburg . 
  this time von hindenburg got 53 % of the vote , hitler got 36.8 % , and th\u00e4lmann got 10.2 % as for the general election of july 31 , 1932 , the nazis got 37.27 % of the popular vote . 
  in the november 1932 elections the nazi party got 33.09 % of the popular vote ( this after massive intimidation and voter violence by the sa ) . 
  in the march 1933 election the nazis got 43.91 % of the vote ( this after tens of thousands of communist party members and leaders were jailed because of the powers given to hitler by the reichstag fire act and the enabling act ) . 
  in november 1933 there was another election , but this one was a complete farce . 
  hitler had already seized complete control of the government , and the nazi party was the only legal party . 
  of course they finally got their majority with 92 % of the popular vote . 
  neither hitler nor the nazi party ever got a majority of the vote . 
  a good summary of the events leading from the 1932 election to hitler assuming total control can be found [ here ] ( http://history1900s.about.com/od/1930s/a/hitler-appointed-chancellor.htm ) . 
  written by / u/smileyman [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1o1li9/til_that_hitler_was_was_elected_by_a_majority_of/ ), 
  how is it relevant who killed to most civilians in ww2 ? 
  and no i am not russian and i went to a dutch school . 
  also , the soviet union suffered the second most civilian casualties . 
  there are a lot of massive differences between russia and nazi germany . 
  what really drove nazi germany to war was purely ideological , mein kampf , plan ostfront ect . 
  putin however is not idealogical in his way of governing . 
  all the recent events are purely geopolitical not idealogical . 
  more differences , putin is not a dictator , he was democratically elected unlike hitler . 
  sure putin is authoritarian but not even close to a dictator . 
  nazi germany used to be one of the greatest powers in europe , nowadays russia barely manages to stay the regional hegemon . 
  even if russia wanted to restore their former borders it could not do it . 
  the idiocy to compare russia to nazi germany is beyond reason . 
  do you even know the slightest of russia ?!, 
  shameful display , these people act like two singers are the representative of their governments . 
  i am truly disappointed . 
  people forget that nearly all wars napoleon fought were defensive wars which he turned into a offensive war by kicking ass . 
  did you forget that hitler 's plan was for poland ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostfront#german_ideology  `` according to a plan called generalplan ost , the populations of occupied central europe and the soviet union were to be partially deported to west siberia , partially enslaved and eventually ** exterminated ** '', 
   `` it 's unclear what caused the fire at odessa 's trade union building '' [ yes it spontaneously combusted ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9amjlbiliw ), 
  you are talking shit : here is the video how it did happen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9amjlbiliw, 
  there are also reports of missing igla 's . 
  people claim that the rockets were indeed guided . 
  they captured weapon depots and trucks with rpg 's in them , see http://youtu.be/c-c1suyf1pa?t=16m skip to 16 min . 
  i can wave a flag around with the dutch crown on it on kings day but that does not mean that i am an totalitarian monarchist .
