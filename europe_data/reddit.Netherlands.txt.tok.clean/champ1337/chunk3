  the backlash of that commercial was even more glorious . 
  the `` mayor '' of slovanysk claims that he did this , i would be really surprised if this is what russia wanted . 
  it would make more sense that he has gone insane/rogue . 
  gross domestic produce is the market value of all officially recognized final goods and services produced within a country in a year . 
  if you spend 4.4 % of your gdp on military it is your budget . 
  that would be great for us of-course , but the us needs to have a capable military to exert influence and remain geopolitical competitive . 
  especially since china is increasing its military . 
  the eu average is 1,55 % which in my opinion is to low . 
  i would like it to be at least 2 % . 
  my country ( the netherlands ) spends 1,35 % gdp on his military . 
  source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union, 
  eu military spending : $ 192,535,000,000 ( 1.55 % gdp ) us military spending : $ 503,000,000,000 ( 3.8 % gdp ) in my opinion all european union nations should spend 2 % gdp or more on their military . 
  you only spend 4.4 % of your gdp on the military compared to the 2 % average . 
  back in the 18th century french was the world language , all the nobility and diplomats spoke french . 
  north korea would not even dare to shut down russia 's gas export to south korea . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  you can view the entire q&a here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pyesplz8uq it is quite long tough . 
  i would have to disagree with this one , there were quite some tough questions about healthcare , and more issues . 
  could anyone translate this ? 
  the title of the post is incredibly dishonest , the article itself claims otherwise . 
  they need the potential to defend the motherland , even tough there is no immediate threat , you do n't know how the world will look like in 50 years . 
  currently russia is protected by [ these natural barriers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ei6dsah.jpg ) . 
  the reason they spend and always have spend much on military is because of the positioning of moscow and the huge territory they own . 
  if the caucus mountain range is lost there is a second hole in their defence alongside with the northern european plain . 
  keep in mind that the dotnesk oblast is densely populated . 
  losing control of chechnya would also mean losing ( partial ) control of the georgian mountain ranges leaving volgograd vulnerable . 
  the article is from 2010 . 
  you should be sceptical about all news channels , not just russian ones . 
  its a rule . 
  no linking to the subreddit please . 
  here is a power point presentation that got leaked . 
  honestly i kind of like it that there are pro russian and pro ukrainian mixed in one subreddit , it gives a more balanced view . 
  what do flemish people think about joining the netherlands ? 
  i agree , it is our rightful clay . 
  '' in this case they are needed to improve the infrastructure of the city . '', 
  so they just need the space for wider roads ? 
  does n't seen unreasonable to me . 
  technically yes , no bullets are fired , and there is no declaration of war . 
  you seem to underestimate the power of an angry mob , peasant revolts are not that uncommon you know , tsar alexander i was forced into a war with napoleon because of internal upheaval and strife caused by the humiliating loss at friedland and by the peace treaty tilsit which was seen as betrayal by the peasants and nobility , emperors and kings did not live in a vacuum . 
  source : moscow 1812 napoleon 's fatal march by adam zamoyski . 
  peasant uprisings could also be seen in ancient china , it was even incorporated into the mandate of heaven , here are some examples : `` the zhou dynasty used the idea of the mandate of heaven to justify the overthrow of the shang dynasty ( c. 1600-1046 bce ) . 
  zhou leaders claimed that the shang emperors had become corrupt and unfit , so heaven demanded their removal . 
  when zhou authority crumbled in turn , there was no strong opposition leader to seize control , so china descended into the warring states period ( c. 475-221 bce ) . 
  it was reunified and expanded by qin shihuangdi , beginning in 221 , but his descendants quickly lost the mandate . 
  the qin dynasty ended in 206 bce , brought down by popular uprisings led by the ** peasant ** rebel leader liu bang , who founded the han dynasty . 
  this cycle continued through the history of china , as in 1644 when the ming dynasty ( 1368-1644 ) lost the mandate and was overthrown by li zicheng 's rebel forces . 
  a shepherd by trade , li zicheng ruled for just two years before he was in turn ousted by the manchus , who founded the qing dynasty ( 1644-1911 ) , china 's final imperial dynasty . '', 
  source : http://asianhistory.about.com/od/ancientchina/f/what-is-the-mandate-of-heaven.htm so i have come to the conclusion that public opinion of the current authority albeit a king or a minister is and always have been very important . 
  this has always been the case in almost every war ever . 
  http://geopolicraticus.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/ukraine-ethnolingusitic_map.png and the eastern part , unfortunately enough this is also where the military industry lies , so if they want to secede/join russia your military is fucked . 
  no please , i do n't want to join * them . 
  suck it finland !, 
  this is the traditional slav dance , http://i.imgur.com/8dv8rdl.gif, 
  it would destroy the dutch economy , it would render rotterdam 's port useless . 
  i still have a few years of studying before me , hopefully when i enter the job market the unemployment rate is reasonable . 
  and so we enter 2014 with misery , hooray !, 
  also , if i want to pick flanders ( which it deserves ) for silliest accent i should be able to . 
  yes minister did a brilliant piece on polls , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0zzjxw4mta, 
  yes indeed . 
  or even worse , the metro or spits it is horrid , no real content it is a glorified gutter press cesspool . 
  might be a mof in disguise . 
  this is at moscow kremlin , not the netherlands . 
  no demon invasions ? 
  its like that one episode from yes minister . 
  itt : goddamn i want some kebab right now . 
  it is never to late for kebab . 
  public disturbance while drunk . 
  tbh if some screaming drunk woke me up i 'd be pretty fucking pissed too . 
  they are still people you know .

   using apenstaartje, 
  the uk will stab anyone in the back when daddy usa tells them to . 
  fucking lapdog government . 
   people need to stop pretending mad was going to be eternal i would rather have our fucking politicians kept in check by nukes pointed at them for as long as possible , it keeps them from starting stupid wars . 
  there will be no capturing of moscow , if nato-russian war breaks out it would be a nuclear holocaust with no victors . 
  i think he ment [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-ballistic_missile_treaty ) treaty . 
  building missile defence systems undermines mad and upsets the power balance . 
   but they brigade often enough . 
  the sentence continues after the comma you dimwit . 
  no , but they brigade often enough . 
  cyborg was a name given to the ukrainian soldiers defending the outpost . 
  i think it was first used by separatist to mock the soldiers . 
   pushing russian agenda in the rest of his post , is not . 
  mate , you have been posting propaganda for 2 years . 
  the only thing you ever post is propaganda , day in day out . 
  / r/ukraina is a nationalistic manipulative shithole . 
  look at it as a long term investment , if you worry about the money . 
  if hypothetically speaking flanders was a part of the netherlands it would cost us some money at the start , but in 30-50 years they become economically profitable , or at least sustainable . 
  compare it to a merger of 2 very large companies . 
  another point , if the netherlands and the flanders re-unite our companies would have significant market dominance in logistics and redistribution for germany ( which increases our gdp ) . 
  since antwerp and rotterdam cooperate instead of compete ), 
  what a joke , a belgian thinking it 's a real country . 
  belgium is nothing more than centuries of british foreign policy . 
  it should be split up , flanders to the netherlands , wallonia to france . 
  like it always should have been . 
  i feel like the new css is really centred around the european union , instead of the european continent . 
  this is just asking for brand confusion .
