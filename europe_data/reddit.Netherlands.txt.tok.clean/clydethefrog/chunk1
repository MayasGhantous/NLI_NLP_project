it 's like the netherland 's cooler brother who is way more into fashion , design and cooking . 
  he really does have a soft side . 
  he has a love for making haikus . 
  i believe the ep still have to approve . 
  but he can speak german ( and probably french ) properly i hope ? 
  i mean , that 's the most spoken mother tongue of europe  . 
  congratulations poland !, 
  i am sure you 're proud and rightly so . 
  edit : already learning why some of you from poland are n't that proud : for that i say congrats on getting a new prime minister soon !, 
  aww , i thought that one was cute . 
  i even bought a tote bag with his adorable physique . 
  great story and wonderful pictures . 
  dreamy actually . 
  i do n't know man , spending 50 `` danish krone '' on a beer instead of 7 euros in copenhagen might feel better . 
  how the hell did the russian separatists shoot down a plane 10 km above the ground with their own weapons ? 
  pretty much confirmed that russia is delivering modern warfare weapons to the separatists . 
  what is your country 's fascination with aku ankka/donald duck ? 
  here in the netherlands the donald duck magazine is still the most popular magazine but you guys actually way better : you even know who carl barks and don rosa are and get a the proper releases of their work . 
  [ there was even a release of a rock album based on don rosa 's scrooge stories this year . 
  ] ( http://www.avclub.com/article/there-is-a-symphonic-finnish-prog-rock-concept-alb-201493 ) edit : actually found the answer in this wikipedia part . 
  explains the voting bill thing as well !, 
  i 've seen this comment several times . 
  care to explain why the greens in dl are to be scared of ? 
  53 percent is in some way critical about the eu . 
  would n't say that whole percentage is also against the eu . 
  they did n't participate that year because they performed too bad the year before . 
  i believe they did n't broadcast that year too . 
  your comment made it sound that most of the time the eu is good for nothing . 
  my comment was a bit shallow as well . 
  sorry , my europhile heart is a bit too passionate sometimes . 
  you have been reading too much of your tabloids . 
  yeah i would think a prinzenvlag would be more fitting . 
  you always see those at extreme right meetings . 
  could we do a livethread for the finale ? 
  loved that last year . 
  but how do we find the terrorists now ? 
  is the hbo series burning bush , about this event worth it ? 
  okay , is this satire or a real newspaper article ? 
  really love the painting of europa watermark . 
  also , bulgary , you better get the euro or we all have to get new ones again without ebpo !, 
  belarus looks like a promo picture of a new wes anderson movie . 
  that woman probably looked the same 30 years earlier . 
  estonia is like the smart young cousin of europe that wants to fix his family 's bloated computers . 
  [ i like that your president talked with `` our '' neelie kroes about moving to our own cloud system instead of an us based one . 
  ] ( http://www.zdnet.com/after-prism-europe-has-to-move-to-its-own-clouds-says-estonias-president-7000018048/ ), 
  same when someone said la chouffe tastes like bbq ham or kwak tastes like banana . 
  hope you did n't screw this beer from me . 
  those good looking french girls . 
  they always look some how mysterious , intellectual and still sexy . 
  someone else worded it better than i can : http://www.beachtomato.com/life/guilty-pleasures/why-are-french-women-sexy/#.uheh9zd8kaw the inbetweeners nailed the portrayal of the male counterpart : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwymfzx8hxi&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player, 
  budapest is still the best city i 've ever visited . 
  those romkocsm\u00e1k are fucking cool to hang out . 
  sorry that half of my country visit sziget every year in your country . 
  why is that a myth ? 
  i 've had several exchanges during high school and germans never were good in english . 
  but not as bad as the people from spain . 
  haha graham describing her texting . 
  hey !, 
  they just gave us 12 points !, 
  poor estonia : (, 
  it was the homoerotic one with the glass box . 
  well for once i understand the ellipsis warning from the bbc . 
  drums !, 
  looks someone 's stylist is a fan of johnny depp . 
  drums !, 
  belarus is the only european country with still a dictator unfortunately . 
  someone accidentally pressed the dubstep button . 
  yes its mandatory, 
  i believe [ this ] ( http://www.sobaka.ru/city/city/32942/ ) is the original article , dutch newspaper had permission to translate it and use it for their article . 
  and their division in france , [ ubisoft montpellier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ubisoft_montpellier ) , is responsible for the more original and refreshing games in ubisoft catalogue ( ignoring all the rabbids and dlc stuff ) . 
  i have to say that rayman is one of the only games that feel so ... european ? 
  michel ancel should be more known . 
  dutch newspaper nrc published a translated interview with a former employee of one of the comment factories that are stated in russia . 
  [ i quickly put it into english google translate again for anyone who is interested . 
  ] ( http://pastebin.com/n1sqc2rl ) it 's an interesting read !, 
  makes me feel sorry for some of the russians bots , just posting about russia all day to have a decent living . 
  the quote  at night i dreamed it was always news about putin and ukraine reminds me of [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2xeo6s/what_color_is_this_gif/cozpfvm ) how it feels to tweet for a living . 
  i will proudly raise my hand , i love the french way of romanticism . 
  as always a list is subjective , but please go to dekmantel instead of mysteryland if you 're into underground electric music and are visiting the netherlands . 
  unless the big , noisy edm as a rock stage is your thing . 
  i thought [ this recap of russian 's reporting ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21652339-vladimir-putin-concocts-new-story-ukraine-leaving-west-wondering-what-he-up?zid=307&amp;ah=5e80419d1bc9821ebe173f4f0f060a07 ) on the visit of western leaders by * the economist * very interesting . 
  after watching this , i can recommend [ danger 5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyxhzoqnmpk ) from our overseas eurovision friend australia if you enjoyed this . 
  the makers stole a lot of jokes ( [ telephone shooting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvsbgbdse0o ) , dinosaur headed police men , time travel to kill hitler ... ) or did n't know about danger 5 before making this . 
  they did it first , and season two is even more crazier than the plot of this one . 
  i think personally they nail the 80s aesthetics and wackiness better , this had wayyy too much slick cgi in my opinion . 
  also , who does n't love ` european ' pierre ? 
  / r/danger5, 
  fifa is lucky , because it would 've happened it they had ties with al qaeda ... / s i would n't say * everyone * , my to some extent critical comment is currently controversial and you only have to look at the top comments of / r/sports and / r/soccer right now to see the general opinion of the united states . 
  thanks for making it clearer on which grounds they were arrested . 
  i think i got on the wrong track because of this paragraph :  united states law gives the justice department wide authority to bring cases against foreign nationals living abroad , an authority that prosecutors have used repeatedly in international terrorism cases . 
  those cases can hinge on the slightest connection to the united states , like the use of an american bank or internet service provider . 
  that 's nice to know , i did n't catch that after reading the article quickly . 
  i 'm conflicted about this . 
  fifa and all it 's horrible corruption should have been dealt with long long ago and i 'm very excited that the us ( applause for lynch , she 's not fucking around ) decided to not take it any longer . 
  but the us charging foreign individuals for crimes conducted on foreign soil because they used an american internet service provider and basically kidnapping them is also something that should n't be cheered for , no matter how big the charges are . 
  let 's hope a lot of international cooperation was used for this . 
  edit : as comments below mentioned , this is not the case . 
  swiss cooperated and much of the inquiry involves concacaf . 
  [ live-thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/36ipj6/live_thread_eurovision_2015_first_semifinal/ ) over at / r/eurovision . 
  thanks for explaining .
