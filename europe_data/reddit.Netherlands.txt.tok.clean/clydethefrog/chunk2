  i get your view now . 
  i do n't agree with you , but it 's bad that you got downvoted for explaining your opinion . 
  what other purpose than vengeance did killing bin laden achieve actually ? 
  al-qaeda , lead by old , ideological terrorists was and is already crippling . 
  you * could * even say that by killing bin laden was the final straw for an even worse terrorist group to take over with a more modern , ruthless tactic we all know today : daesh . 
  omnipollo is a treat for both my eyes and my liver edit : should have specified it 's a swedish brewery with beautiful designed bottles and fine flavours . 
  i absolutely love that subreddit . 
  always come there to relax and look at new , quality content and the comments are always informative and knowledgeable . 
  learned about so many new artists and art history . 
  the perfect subreddit basically . 
  if anyone enjoyed looking at this gallery i would definitely recommend it . 
  i 'm always afraid to share it because i do n't want it get ruined and become / r/art . 
  [ yes .

  before eu rules fix this violation of privacy ( which probably will take a long time and will be difficult ) , i advice people to use ublock ( and , optional , privacybadger . ), 
  when you installed the plugin , go to settings and activate the several social block add-ons . 
  doing this will also disable some facebook functionality on sites like commenting or logging in with your fb account , but if you care about this you probably do n't use those add-ons in the first place . 
  if some essential things do n't work but you still want to use these plugins , download a second browser . 
  for instance , use chrome/chromium for normal use and chrome canary for browsing the websites that only work without plugins . 
  i have been using this tactic for a few years now - i still have n't seen an ad that was based on my browsing behaviour since i have been doing this . 
  dutch cinema : it 's like hbo , with [ minors . 
  you 're not alone . 
  even as a native speaker i sometimes cringe at dutch dialogues . 
  does n't help that for some reason a dutch movie always needs a overly dramatic scene with screaming and cursing . 
  after the obligatorily naked scene of course . 
  i 'm all in for this !, 
  maybe collaborate with some knowledgeable people over at / r/truefilm edit : also , maybe look at the official lists at icheckmovies.com . 
  made by dutch guys and has many great `` official '' top lists of several european countries , based on polls or books from movie critics . 
  much better than many american centric lists on imdb in my opinion . 
  nicely said . 
  some of these inside jokes of polandball leak into other subreddits but without any context or setup and for outsiders or people not into the know these jokes can be very controversial . 
  second paragraph :  although the robin is often referred to as britain 's national bird , that title is a purely unofficial one , deriving from a survey in the times in the 1960s . 
  but that is all set to change . 
  from monday until the day of the general election , thursday 7 may , we all have the chance to vote for a new national bird . 
  from a scientific and technical viewpoint it 's quite exciting ... a world of information just in your pocket , self-driving cars , [ discovering the fundamentals of physics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omc6octxiem ) ... also , we might even see [ the death of geoblocking ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2015/05/06/europe-announces-proposals-to-abolish-geo-blocking/ ) !, 
  what a time to be alive !, 
  i was thinking about it too when i first discovered / r/yurop , and i think because it 's called the [ european robin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_robin ) , it 's [ distribution is almost eu only ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_robin#/media/file:erithacus_rubecula_distribution.png ) and it 's just a cute , harmless alternative to [ the national bird of the usa . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhitpttg888&amp;feature=youtu.be ) perfect actually . 
  unfortunately , the uk was having a national bird poll this week ... [ and the robin is a favourite in the polls . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2015/mar/16/wren-robin-red-kite-britain-national-bird-national-poll ) i already see a situation in 10 years when nationalistic uk citizens are protesting about the eu stealing their national bird . 
  i remember fun , children travelguides my parents always gave me during our holiday trips . 
  they probably were given for free as eu promotion from travel agencies . 
  these books were full of interesting facts and stories from other eu countries , and they also gave me that special feeling you describing . 
  i saw [ this poster \\ [ pdf alert ! \\ ] ] ( http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/united-in-diversity-pbkc3110600/downloads/kc-31-10-600-d2-p/kc3110600d2p_002.pdf?filename=kc3110600d2p_002.pdf&amp;sku=kc3110600d2p_pdf&amp;cataloguenumber=kc-31-10-600-d2-p ) a few weeks ago a friend got for free during her visit in brussels , which gave me that similar feeling again !, 
  some would say it 's propaganda but i think it 's a cute poster . 
  the eurovision tune gives me a nostalgic safe feeling - i remember some entertainment programs and sport events having this tune at the beginning when i was younger . 
  i also see [ products with the eu leaf ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/downloads/logo/index_en.htm ) on it as real quality products and perceive similar products without it as `` inferior '' : marketing well done i guess . 
  what about the eurovision anthem ? 
  there is already the second half of wall-e and idiocracy . 
  [ simon ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393775/ ) , about an unlikely friendship and the liberal dutch view on sexuality and euthanasia . 
  unfortunately has a bit of the dutch movie cliches ( lots of swearing and nude scenes without any purpose ) . 
  [ de marathon ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2401621/ ) , about four typical guys from rotterdam running a marathon . 
  rude jokes but still a touching story . 
  [ aanmodderfakker ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3983266/ ) , about an eternal student who meets a young ambitious girl with a complete different view on life . 
  loved this one , almost felt like a [ dutch wes anderson movie . 
  ] ( https://puu.sh/g6h90/47e6eafb4c.jpg ) it has those carefully shot scenes but with a dutch/amsterdam touch . 
  that scene is hilarious , although i hope it 's more satire than cynicism . 
  the rest of the movie worth it ? 
  the director got inspired to make a movie about that event , but then changed his mind :  initially zvyagintsev wanted to shoot his story -- which borrows the spur , rather than the plot -- in america . 
  `` but time went by , the project evolved and i thought it ** better to set it in russia ** . '', 
  [ source ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/29/leviathan-russian-cannes-movie-putin-attack ) also , according to ** producer ** alexander rodnyansky :  `` it deals with some of the most important social issues of contemporary russia [ ... ] . '',

  nice suggestions !, 
  especially curious about deutschland 83 . 
  we should have a `` good european tv series '' thread some day . 
  unfortunately i do n't know any good contributions from my country ... heard * penoza * was interesting but could n't get into it . 
  but they are because of the eu , right ? 
  replace adblock with ublock and maybe remove some other extensions you do n't use . 
  that 's the major reason chrome uses some much ram for people . 
  you want more ? 
  just saying , i 'm a big fan of the guy and sometimes he crosses a line , but he never hurts people on purpose . 
  in a lot of instances , people who are getting harassed are into the joke . 
  especially when he is joking with kids . 
  so before you think he really is a dirty paedophile or creep ... * [ here he is being creepy during a whole song with a kid . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtnbkah1mza ) * [ here he is criticizing a kid for a bad performance ] ( https://youtu.be/u3fc2psb8ek?t=318 ) . 
  `` if i was your father , i would even kicked more teeth of your mouth '' * [ a streaker is ruining his show ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um7nzqv_ibk ) , but he is disappointed he is not completely naked , because that 's what a real streaker does . 
  look what happens around 3:00 ... * [ taking his time ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbf7_vgmzd4 ) to make fun of the presenters of eurovision . 
  * [ he let people smoke weed ] ( https://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.totaaltv.nl%2fnieuws%2f13084%2feinde-belgische-tv-show-paul-de-leeuw.html&amp;edit-text= ) in his belgium show . 
  you think this is `` bad '' ? 
  check out a presenter sucking breastmilk from someone in the audience around 0:40 : https://youtu.be/mq5dr-on0em in the netherlands we have this guy called paul de leeuw , who did so much weird shit already that i 'm surprised he is not well-known in whole europe . 
  harassing kids , stripping down protestors , going naked himself ... seen it all . 
  it 's a cool guy though , was one of the first people that spoke about aids for instance back when it was taboo and he has a good heart . 
  there were some more protests in other parts of europe , like belgium and germany with about the same amount of people . 
  i did n't hear about any protests planned this weekend , but hopefully the next one will be better promoted . 
  i will definitely join it . 
  real europeans like star trek more anyway . 
  ca n't wait when esa is going to explore the universe . 
  star wars has such a american viewpoint of good vs. evil . 
  why ? 
  for who is interested , going a bit off-topic ... : [ the public television in the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_public_broadcasting_system#list_of_broadcasters ) is the epitome of the [ polder model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polder_model ) . 
  you can even become a member of one of the twelve broadcasting parties or start your own : in 2009 [ powned ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/powned ) was founded - yes , their name is a wink to the video game slang . 
  anecdotal , i have to say that being a member of a broadcasting assocation has almost the same load as voting for a certain political party . 
  i 'd would never marry someone who watches tros programs !, 
  my perfect partner reads the vpro gids with me before going to bed : the most beautiful tv guide in the world , it even has won numeral magazine awards . 
  look at [ this one ] ( http://www.coverjunkie.com/blog/911/3/7323 ) about 10 years after 9/11 for instance . 
  this has to be satire . 
  it 's perfect . 
  do not know why you are downvoted . 
  new kids is the perfect continuation of our proud dutch culture .
