  i think it has to happen again , with the caveat that anyone whose connection has the word `` university '' in it can not participate . 
   if people in the uk are more likely to have negative attitudes about americans ** if ** . 
  i really do n't think that 's the case to any significant degree , just that many americans are insecure about being abroad since they are constantly being told that the rest of the world is out to get them , and consequently have thin skins . 
  then they report that they are being verbally abused , and the cycle goes from there . 
   last time i was there , her boyfriend started explaining william the conqueror to me like i was five . 
  how many americans would you say know anything about william the conqueror ? 
  i do n't think this is a very useful way of determining where to live . 
  there is no country in europe with significant , sincere anti-american sentiment that would affect your experience . 
  some cultures in europe tend more towards blunt discussion , which may include criticism of us policies , but it 's not personal . 
  and some cultures ( uk and irish being those i 'm most familiar with in this regard ) favor `` rough '' verbal teasing , but again , the fact that you 're american would n't be the reason , it 's just something to latch onto for the sake of teasing , and if you were n't american , they 'd find something else . 
  ** however ** , the fact that you 're asking this question in the first place , suggests to me that you are predisposed to the nonsense narrative that the rest of the world hates people from the usa , and therefore you 're more likely to misinterpret the above behaviors as being anti-american , and react defensively rather than in the spirit intended . 
  for this reason i expect you might have some problems ( largely of your own creation ) no matter where you go . 
   yeah , great , but when you 're visiting and you 're with a group of people you do n't know well , it 's hard to determine who 's taking the piss , and who will turn into a drunken asshole if you turn it back on them . 
  especially when the anti-american sentiment in the uk is legit . 
  this has nothing to do with being an american . 
  if you were australian , or french , or whatever else , you 'd still get it . 
  yeah , but he 's not an `` it '' . 
  unless the telegraph knows something we do n't , and all that macho photo posturing is overcompensation . 
   i think i like the netherlands the most . 
  it looks like a random block of buildings that were just sort of combined , and a few towers added for effect . 
  the result is fairly charming , i think , with the added benefit of looking rather large . 
  you can walk through the courtyard that runs through it ; from that vantage it clearly does seem like a bunch of buildings that sort of grew together over the years . 
  and that 's not how an average works . 
  i 'm a fairly heavy user and i do n't think i even noticed when my isp doubled the speed from 60 to 120mbps . 
  i definitely would n't pay the extra $ 15 for 200mbps . 
   i actually think speedtest results are a terrible way to judge an area/country 's internet speed . 
  yes , for this reason the akamai reports are probably the most useful , as they pump a lot of data to almost every internet user in normal day-to-day conditions . 
  at least there 's near-universal competition between cable and dsl , the latter offering up to 8/80 speeds . 
  ftth availability is growing and most houses are actually served by fiber to the neighborhood . 
  as the ftth network increases i think we 'll see more vibrant competition , unless the regulator lets kpn get a stranglehold on the network . 
  except for korean , asiana , ana , cathay , eva , and china southern . 
  they shot at the plane without figuring out what it was first . 
  that 's pretty much the same in my book . 
   the antonov shot down the other day was flying at 6.5 km . 
  the boeing was only flying 3.5 km higher . 
  that 's a lot higher . 
   i wanted to point is that putin killed citizens of the country where his daughter lives i hardly think that was his intention . 
  this development makes life much more difficult for him . 
   due to ** less competition ** and because austrian telcos made a lot of money with roaming you are grossly overstating the significance of lowered roaming fees , and understanding the significance of market consolidation . 
   unless they want to wear something on their face . 
  no , then they have saudi arabia . 
   yea it 's a possibility but it 's also a possibility today . 
  if you do it today , the regulator will put you back in line . 
   for the same reason we try to avoid war because both sides stand to lose more often then not . 
  and yet there are still plenty of wars , many of them initiated by heads of state who presumably would pass your earlier test as being considered rational because of their position of authority . 
   i do n't hear of too many people with vendetta 's against phone companies investing in signal blockers i was thinking more along the lines of one phone company configuring its equipment to cause interference for their competitors . 
   any rational group of people so you will impose a rationality test on people who want to run mobile phone companies ? 
  also , as game theory has taught us , there are often strategies which allow one party to sabotage others and still benefit , especially in complicated situations . 
  i do n't think that 's true ; almost all carriers in the netherlands ( most expensive mobiles in europe , hoorah ) charge more for domestic usage than the caps they 've been required to implement for international usage . 
  t-mobile usa offers unlimited roaming data throughout europe . 
  throttled after some point though . 
  does n't your phone show an `` r '' icon when you 're roaming ? 
  ... and phones would n't work at all because of the lack of spectrum management . 
  somehow i doubt that europe would be that dramatically better off economically if the wars had n't happened . 
  it 's entirely likely we 'd be worse off . 
  yep , both are in north america but not in america . 
  well , no , it 's in canada , which is in north america . 
  maybe your business was in a very english-friendly area or so ? 
  overall , i can think of no country in europe where it 's harder to function with english than spain . 
  of whom how many can not speak english ? 
  few people who have visited both austria and scandiavia would give much credence to that statistic , though . 
  i do n't think many parents speak it to their kids unless it 's a conscious effort to assist them with english studies in school , or they are preparing to go on a holiday abroad , or something . 
  however it 's really normal for younger dutch people ( teenagers and twentiesers ) to pepper conversation with bits of english . 
  dutch sentences will contain bits like `` totally amazing '' and `` fuck off '' without dropping a beat . 
  hung over *, 
  one thing in particular stands out - it seems almost impossible to shake the french accent . 
  a native french speaker who learned english in school rather than on the streets , it seems , will almost never be able to speak english without ze stereotypical accent . 
  i have french friends who have been reading exclusively english literature for a decade , who have mastered every nuance of american and british slang , who can best me in debates on fine points of english grammar , and still they sound like inspector clouseau . 
   children ? 
  i have a kid in group 1 ( 4/5 year olds ) in a dutch school , and i can speak at least some english with many of his classmates , which they seem to find amusing . 
  the older kids at the school ( age 10 and up ) can all speak some . 
  very old people in rural areas sometimes do n't speak a lot ( or have forgotten it through disuse ) , but really there 's one big group here who 's less likely to speak english than anyone else : immigrants . 
  people who moved from morocco and turkey ( and sometimes eastern europe ) who are in their 30s and up , and who work blue-collar jobs , are in my experience far and away the least conversant in english . 
  i was surprised by the numbers on that map for spain vs portugal . 
  my sense in portugal has been that almost anyone i talk to can speak some english , while in spain my sense is that almost nobody can ( speak english , or really anything but spanish ) . 
  i would therefore have expected more of a gap in percent . 
  perhaps there 's a self-reporting issue here ? 
  you also have to register with the municipality where you 'll be living , at least in the netherlands . 
  well , that 's never going to happen , and if you drive a car you 'd hate it , because you 'd be paying about $ 12/gallon for fuel . 
  i am not sure what argument you are trying to make . 
  we should n't provide token subsidies to bicyclists along the lines of those provided to drivers and public transport riders , because not everyone has a car or a bike ? 
  then why should we subsidize drivers ? 
  the largest subsidies by far are for automobile drivers . 
  this is followed by subsidies for public transport users . 
  any money that happened to make its way to a cyclist would be a drop in the bucket compared to the tidal wave moving in the other direction . 
  most efficient in terms of infrastructure utilization and energy-to-motion conversion , best health benefits , etc. 
  every other form of wheeled transport is subsidized , why not also subsidize the one that 's best for everyone ? 
   look like they pump iron that sort of thing tends to fall off rapidly with age . 
  on the other hand , fundamental lifestyle behaviors , especially those tied to city design , such as walking and cycling in the netherlands , will persist much longer into advanced years than pumping iron . 
  my 80-year-old neighbor rides his bicycle everywhere , but he sure does n't lift weights . 
  has israel shown a strong focus on the norway-russia border ? 
  i do n't think isolationist foreign policy is necessarily right wing . 
  i 'd rather have a system where it was fairly easy to understand how the security works . 
  this is important for public confidence , i think . 
  there have been so many problems with computer voting , and so many un-falsifiable allegations of vote rigging , that the entire idea is tainted for the time being . 
  can we just call them the fish balls party ? 
   it 's goddamn absurd that putin actually pouts like a child at this , i do n't know if he is serious about his social conservatism or if it 's just a persona he put on to get votes . 
  ... or the torrential outrage of the closeted ? 
   i 've met a few americans in my life who really took it for granted that i was speaking english to them . 
  you mean they did n't show sufficient gratitude that you had a valuable skill ( fluency in a foreign language ) that they did n't ?
