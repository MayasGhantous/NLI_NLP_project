  littering is forbidden . 
  insulting the police is an offence . 
  the police should say something about this when they are on patrol in the streets , to look out for people hurting other people . 
  i have no problem with police giving citations to people who litter . 
  i have a huge problem with police giving citations to people who `` insult '' them . 
  few things more quickly erode my respect for the police than having them behave like cry-baby children who ca n't take an insult . 
   there is also a level of respect needed for the police in order for them to do their job , the ability to penalize this appalling behavior is a good thing . 
  it has nothing to do with being upset , it has everything to do with respect for the law , which the police officer embodies . 
  exactly . 
  this is why police should not have their respect undermined by stupid laws like this , that only serve to infantilize them . 
  while i applaud the ruling , i have a very hard time with the law in question . 
  if someone ca n't handle being insulted by a homeless man without needing to resort to retribution with the assistance of the state , that person does not have the necessary maturity of character to be a police officer . 
  being upset by taunts and insults is for schoolchildren . 
  the police should focus their energies on people who are actually hurting someone . 
  exactly . 
  they did n't need all those stadiums to build a metro . 
  they would have had far less debt and greeks would be in much better shape . 
  it 's very tragic . 
  it 's hard for me to understand why one country after another fights for the opportunity to bankrupt itself in such a flagrantly wasteful undertaking . 
  it seems to be a mixture of hubris and venality : hubris because spending billions of dollars on hiring contractors to run a sporting event is the most idiotic source of `` pride '' that i can imagine ; anyone with the ability to borrow billions of dollars can do this with equal facility . 
  the only distinguishing factor from one country to the next is the vendor-selection process , hardly the stuff of national greatness . 
  venality because with that much money at stake there 's no way an awful lot of it is n't going missing . 
  any politician who supports an olympic bid is automatically on my `` do n't vote for this crook '' list . 
  i think we need to work hard to make sure more people see it the same way . 
  if signing one 's country up for this criminal sham was guaranteed to be the death of someone 's political career , maybe at least they 'd think twice about it . 
  and do n't even get me started on the secondary issues , like how the olympic commission has basically turned into a giant intellectual property portfolio with the armed support of national police in the host countries . 
  it runs completely counter to ideals of freedom . 
  i do n't understand ; is n't voting quite precisely the democratic system ? 
  or only voting that leads to the outcome you want ? 
  that 's too black-and-white a view . 
  i grow up in ivory coast . 
  i love the food and the music and my national football team and the dancing in the streets . 
  then civil war breaks out . 
  my relatives are being killed around me . 
  i am fortunate enough to be able to get a job in switzerland . 
  there i have a safe , stable life but i continue to miss the food , the music , my friends and family and the street life . 
  some evenings i sit at home and reflect on what i miss from my past life . 
  out of sentimentality i put up an ivoirean flag . 
  does this mean i am not grateful to switzerland , or that i prefer one to the other , or anything else ? 
  it just means i wanted to put up a flag . 
  i love the quote from the green party dude at the end : `` obliging people to give the impression that they like our country is nonsense . '', 
  people may be in switzerland for economic or family reasons . 
  this does n't stop them from being sentimental about home . 
  it is absurd to demand that everyone profess to like their current location better than everywhere else . 
  yep , it 's an ip block here . 
  they can submit additional ip addresses to block as well . 
  they replaced the proxy with a list of links to other proxies . 
  the first one i tried worked ( i 'm on one of the isps affected by the ruling ) , so i assume many of the others do too . 
   putting all countries together will invariably lead to some people becoming the victim of the idiocy of others . 
  look at the us , for example . 
  the texas board of education is the de facto decider on what school books the rest of the us will use and there 's people there who want to shove creationism into science class . 
  that 's not because of the legal structure . 
  it 's because of the market power of the texas school board . 
  they buy so many books , and are so pushy with the suppliers , that the suppliers find it more profitable to go along with what texas wants . 
  if everyone spoke the same language in europe you 'd see the same kinds of things ( with regard to books ) . 
  if they do n't , then you wo n't . 
  well , these factors probably also mean that people who are conversant in english and study in english-speaking countries have an advantage in their education . 
  so i would n't necessarily take it as a reason to discount the rankings . 
  oh , i think there are plenty of good reasons to learn more languages ; i just do n't think that if cost-effectiveness is your concern , that it makes sense to teach everyone a whole bunch of languages rather than teaching them all the same one . 
   people learning extra languages in school means less money spent on translations . 
  i find it really hard to believe that the cost of translations ( where one person can translate a document read by thousands ) would ever approach the cost of teaching people more languages ( where every single person spends , over time , a year of their life studying ) . 
  they 're definitely not a single issue party . 
  i do n't really care that much about laws on software piracy ( so long as they 're not ** too ** draconian ) , but i still find myself drawn to the pirate party 's agenda of open government and freedom of expression . 
  i think they may be onto something , because i bet that would resonate with a lot of younger people if the word got out more effectively . 
  if they 're going to keep it at par with the british pound then there 's probably little point to printing their own . 
  they 'd have to support it with a cellar full of currency reserves and still , due to the relative sizes of the economies , would n't have much macroeconomic control . 
  the only advantage would be the ability to softly decouple at a later point , but given the history of interchangeability that would still be extremely disruptive . 
  1 ) as someone in the article pointed out , basically it 's a video of a white women being physically attacked by a bunch of dark-skinned foreigners . 
  for a great many people , the first connotation that comes to mind is street safety , not economic cooperation . 
  2 ) even if you do n't personally find it offensive , it 's still important that many other people obviously would . 
  whether or not people are `` too sensitive '' for your tastes , it 's still a reality that needs to be considered when creating a public message . 
  the lack of certainty right now is even worse than any eventual change would be ; it 's brought the market near a dead stop . 
  the government needs to put forth a clear plan for dealing with the mortgage deduction so that people can make sensible property valuations again . 
  it 's not the dutch government 's job to condemn every single thing they do n't and/or should n't like . 
   i 've given positive reasons why i think they should n't be allowed to vote and you have n't attempted to engage with that . 
  what is the positive reason you 've provided for why they should n't be allowed to vote ? 
  i have absolutely engaged with the question of whether it 's a good idea for prisoners to be able to influence public policy ; in fact that 's where i 've spent the most of my time in this discussion ( other than dealing with all the weird efforts to get the conversation off-track by misattributing quotes ) . 
  on second thought , forget it , you win . 
  this is n't fun for me . 
  i like to talk with people with whom i can have a constructive discussion under rules of logic that make basic sense to me . 
   one only has to look one response up in the thread to see how you 're lying ... 
  i think you might be on drugs . 
  ** the39thpotato ** wrote :  they are fundamental rights of all people , unless you are suggesting that prisoners are not people then there is no reason to deny them their rights . 
  prisoners are among those whose lives are most affected by the state , they of all people have an interest in who is running it and how . 
  and then you wrote :  you deny them many ` rights ' by locking them up . 
  you 've already accepted that . 
  that was `` your response to someone 's question about why it was acceptable to deny a given right ( voting ) '' . 
  it 's plain as day , unless you propose that reddit 's server is buggy and mis-threading replies . 
  screenshot here in case that helps you : http://i.imgur.com/vtuyv.png  and we 're talking about the uk , and the appropriate action would be to campaign against such laws . 
  no doubt on the planet thermidore they wear live argleflangers as shoes . 
  i agree that it 's a good idea to campaign against that law . 
  in the meantime , it 's also true that sometimes awareness of these bad laws is created when people face harsh sanctions from the state for violating them . 
  most laws are probably good , some are bad . 
  but until they 're all good , i do n't see why someone who violates them should lose rights for political participation . 
  you have n't made that case ; you 've only repeated that since they lose some rights , they might as well lose some others , and then gotten really defensive and hostile and bizarre . 
   your question is childish . 
  this was your response to someone 's question about why it was acceptable to deny a given right ( voting ) : `` you deny them many ` rights ' by locking them up . 
  you 've already accepted that . '', 
  your response applies equally well to the right not to be tortured as it does to the right to vote . 
   if a criminal has proven himself , through his breaking the law , to be so beyond the pale that we find it necessary to deprive him of his liberty ; then we do not wish him to participate in electing people who make the laws he abuses .
