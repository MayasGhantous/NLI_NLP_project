  passengers arriving and departing on flights to/from non-schengen countries use different gates , security screening facilities , and once airside , shops , restaurants , lounges , and toilets from those who are going to/from schengen countries . 
  edit : i added a word `` major '' , because it turns out that some smaller airports do n't have this , and instead channel passengers from non-schengen destinations directly to immigration . 
  be jealous of the kiwis , they do n't have that restriction when they come to europe . 
   the countries who are against the admission are far more afraid of poverty immigration from those countries . 
  i believe they are also concerned about people coming from ukraine , moldova , and turkey . 
  the objecting countries have argued that border controls in romania and bulgaria are not sufficient to serve as effective bulwarks of the schengen area . 
   only by land that 's not true . 
  this should be obvious to you from the segregation of schengen-zone airports into schengen and non-schengen areas . 
  passengers who have already entered the schengen area -- whether by land , sea , or air -- do not have to go through an immigration inspection when flying to another schengen member country . 
  where would someone live that this would take them 90 minutes , but driving directly into paris at the same time of day would be considerably faster ? 
  it seems like a niche argument . 
  a few years ago we were promised that the entire 1st would be car-free by now . 
  what happened to that ? 
  make no mistake , i 'm happy about any progress , but it is frustrating how slow the pace of change is . 
   what they can do is drive to another suburb where there is public transportation to paris . 
  this is better for everyone . 
  is everyone else using imap ? 
  my conclusion based on reading all the english in this thread is that the finnish language does not use definite articles ( e.g. , `` the '' ) . 
  is this correct ? 
   why am i being punished more harshly because i work more ? 
  you 're not , you 're being punished with the same harshness as anyone else : 4 days ' income . 
   personally , i think the police had to arrest the diplomat who `` dragged a kid by his hairs through the house '' under the vienna convention , he ca n't be arrested here . 
  however , we can kick him out of the country , which is what we should have done . 
   there 's not much more a box on your network would be able to see about you than an outside computer would they do n't show enough details to be sure , but it looks like they are proposing installing this device in such a way that it serves as the wifi access point and ethernet switch . 
  that means it has access to much or all of your internal traffic ( depending on whether you have other switches or access points ) . 
  viewing of media stored on the local network , number of devices in the home , which devices from other homes are regularly in your home , not to mention the ability to conduct mitm attacks against connections to non-encrypted outside servers . 
  it 's a lot to potentially give away . 
  how do you know that what 's installed is the same stuff that 's published under gpl ? 
  and how do you know there 's no other hardware in there ? 
  for athens and paris they used two sampling areas ; one for the city proper and one for the city including the metro area . 
   trading algorithms are 100 % rational . 
  i 'd say they 're completely irrational , as they can offer no justification whatsoever for their choices . 
  they just follow a heuristic because they were told to , like a small child . 
   has anyone travelled extensively across europe and the us ? 
  how accurate is it to compare the cultural differences between us states with cultural differences between european countries as they often do on reddit ? 
  i have lived in over a dozen us states , and a handful of european countries . 
  i 've visited almost all of both . 
  the comparison is absolutely absurd . 
  it 's laughable and immediately reveals the person making it as being ignorant . 
   pretty much all dutch universities rank top 200 . 
  however , the highest ranking university in the netherlands is only placed 67th . 
  is n't that the goal of social policy here ? 
  provide perfectly decent service across the board but nothing spectacular for anyone in particular . 
  is n't almost every 6th german ten years old or younger ? 
  not only that , some eu countries are left out . 
  poor guy , what a terribly sad story . 
  how do the age limits work ? 
  is the payment slot really high ? 
  do you have to answer a question about politics or 1970s music before it lets you purchase ? 
   half a billion reichsmarks what 's that worth , like $ 18 ? 
  netherlands : the institution seems absurd to me , but overall it seems more popular than not . 
  i regularly hear people mount convoluted defenses of the monarchy on factual-sounding grounds . 
  for example , there 's the funny one about how the dutch monarchy brings in umpteen million euros a year by witnessing contract signings , as if anyone has ever decided to spend $ 20,000,000 with a dutch company because what they really wanted was to meet the queen . 
  of course these rationales do n't hold up ; it 's kind of like `` intelligent design '' advocates who try to put a sciencey coat of paint on what is ultimately a completely faith-based position , and i think they 'd all be more convincing if they just admitted it was sentimentality . 
   one of my favourite pieces of welsh engineering is ** dinorwig ** power station in where lots and lots of water is stored at high altitudes in the ** marchlyn mawr ** reservoir . 
  one of my favorite pieces of welsh engineering is their spelling system . 
  not many people know this , but welsh orthography actually builds upon quantum mechanics effects which are still poorly understood by contemporary physicists . 
  some have theorized that it could only have come from aliens . 
   if you want real chinese food in europe , amsterdam is the place where , oh where ? 
  none of my chinese friends or i have ever been able to find any authentic chinese food in amsterdam . 
   surely that would n't be legal either ? 
  under eu law you ca n't restrict things to only citizens of your own country . 
  the restriction was based on residency , not citizenship . 
  someone from canada or spain who was officially resident in maastricht could get a wietpas . 
   also , probably the most heavily deforested country in the world . 
  someone told me there 's 1 square km of wild forest left , and that , too has wayposts so people do n't get lost . 
  not sure what you mean by `` wild forest '' , but if you mean land with trees and random stuff growing on it , then no , that 's not true at all , there are thousands of km2 . 
  if you mean original forest which is untouched since the pre-human period , i do n't know the answer to that . 
   $ 825 thousand does that include all the associated expenses ? 
  there are plenty of leaders , like netanyahu , who speak english extremely well and do n't hesitate to do so . 
  what about linking to sites that link to copyrighted material ? 
  what about links to sites that link to sites that link to copyrighted material ? 
  either you just need to launder it with one link , or they are going to put every webmaster in the world in jail . 
  no , it 's just that the few welsh speakers ca n't stand each other so they 've evenly distributed themselves across all of wales . 
  simple rule of thumb : eurailpass is almost never worth it . 
  if you want to take the train , buy individual tickets , as far in advance as you can plan for it in those countries where that makes a difference ( yes germany , no netherlands ) . 
  also check budget flights for long stretches . 
   i 'm dumbfunded that someone ca n't see any use in a simple and solid backup system . 
  maybe you could hang out with people who are similarly dumfounded that minitel lost its popularity in france . 
   honestly the state/eu should make cash illegal in a decade or two , no real need for it . 
  i do n't want all my spending habits in one giant database . 
  maybe this old-fashioned atm idea is useful for a country where people do n't have reliable access to the internet . 
  however , i do n't think most of europe is in that situation . 
   you can also use the internet of course , but the internet is n't always at hand . 
  the internet sure is at hand a lot more than an atm is . 
  this was interesting when they were doing it in singapore 10 years ago . 
  these days the idea is completely obsolete . 
  we all have laptops , tablets , and smartphones , so we can do these things anywhere instead of having to stomp around town looking for an atm . 
  why would i want to take such a big step backwards ? 
  cheap within spanish cities , expensive between them ( except certain popular bus routes ) . 
   the existing one is not exactly great as auber is a bit further away from saint lazare plus saturated . 
  i agree that fighting your way through the tunnel from saint-lazare to auber during peak hours is an unpleasant struggle . 
  this brings up the really ugly aspect of the situation : even if you increase the capacity of the trains , the stations are overcrowded . 
  if you increase the capacity of the stations , the transfer tunnels are overcrowded . 
  if you increase the capacity of the transfer tunnels , the passages to the street are overcrowded , and so on . 
  this is why i feel velib has been a great thing for the city , and could be even greater if automobile traffic were progressively removed from the city center so that more space-efficient modes ( buses and bicycles ) could operate more smoothly , complementing the underground trains . 
  the increase in bicycle traffic takes pressure off metro without any of the cascading complications that metro/rer capacity improvements would bring . 
  the only people negatively impacted are drivers , who are already the least efficient users of transport infrastructure in the densest zones . 
  indeed i have ; i often work in paris . 
  `` direct '' means without any change of trains .
