this ugly thing was also built on important land  `` aksaray '' was erected on land inside the ataturk forest farm , which ataturk created in 1925 and donated to the state in 1937 . 
  the farm , which functioned as a pioneering model for modern agriculture , was registered as a first-degree protected site in 1992 , which meant that constructing buildings there was illegal . 
  it remains illegal .

  yeah , i have an email contact who ships globally i think , only take bitcoins though , and only sells cartons of cigs , no tobacco . 
  my dad on the other hand orders dried and unprocessed tobacco leaf from germany , it is untaxed , but he does have to grind and mix it . 
  it costs him less than $ 0.50 a pouch though . 
  i get my cigarettes shipped to me from moldova , costs me $ 2.70 / pack . 
  though i 'm switching to ecigs now , because then the weekly cost is only about $ 4 , and it 's of course healthier and less smelly . 
  i know the netherlands has much to gain from export , but it 's not us holding the ecb back , it 's germany . 
  [ europe struggles to avoid deflation 's grip ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/business/international/europe-struggles-to-avoid-deflations-grip.html ) ( june 3 , 2014 )  while the stimulus may help weak economies like those of greece , portugal , italy and cyprus , ** germany is wary of allowing inflation to increase ** , which evokes dark memories of more unstable times in the days before world war ii . 
  somewhat higher inflation in germany would be useful to the other countries in the euro zone , say economists , by making workers in other countries more competitive . 
  but if the bank 's efforts fall short , economists say , the low inflation in euro zone countries could turn into a deflationary trend , similar to what has taken hold in greece . 
  i did n't argue that that was the reason germany entered the ez , i was just saying that entering it turned out to be greatly beneficial to germany , and without a powerful and independent central bank , greatly destabilizing to europe . 
  i 'm glad you could take my title in jest . 
  the eu still is n't doing enough of their quantitative easing according to the imf . 
  what they are doing is not the most helpful to the countries in crisis . 
  the best stimulus for them would be if the ecd was allowed to print money and directly purchase their bonds . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/05/us-ecb-imf-idusbrea241bj20140305  the european central bank should cut interest rates and either inject more liquidity into the banking system via its long-term refinancing operations ( ltro ) or start public and private asset purchases , international monetary fund officials said . 
  [ europe struggles to avoid deflation 's grip ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/business/international/europe-struggles-to-avoid-deflations-grip.html ) ( june 3 , 2014 ! ), 
   i concede your point on the relative value of currencies - do you know if there has been any academic work done ? 
  there probably has been , but i 'm not familiar with economic academia , just familiar through what i 've read in articles and such . 
   i genuinely do n't think that southern europe will separate from the eu i 'm not to sure , if this situation does n't get better any time soon , what else could they do ? 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26171213  the rate increased from 27.7 % in the previous month . 
  for those under the age of 25 , unemployment hit 61.4 % . 
   harsh austerity measures have led the greek economy to shrink by a quarter in four years . 
   however , other economic indicators have suggested that there are signs of recovery . 
  recent news reveals that unemployment [ dropped to 26,5 % ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/06/03/eurostat-slight-decrease-in-unemployment/ ) . 
  so maybe they will recover , but it 's still very fragile , and who knows when the next global crisis will be spawned . 
  my guess would be pretty soon as the us has taken [ almost 0 measures to prevent the financial sector from repeating their massive robbery ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clfbxwpkbku ) . 
  no , them entering the euro was not bad , but once in they prevented the original roadmap for the eurozone which would have formed a banking union and an independent and powerful central bank . 
  in the current situation germany still has enough control on the ecb to prevent them from using quantitative easing to bail out the countries in crisis . 
  even the imf is begging europe to print money as we are [ nearing deflation with only 0.5 % inflation at the moment ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/business/international/europe-struggles-to-avoid-deflations-grip.html ) . 
  the original roadmap of the euro would have led to a banking union and a powerful central bank , because germany and other countries did n't want to relinquish control to the central bank this never happened , and we were left with this broken euro . 
  as is clear , germany is still largely responsible for preventing the ecb from printing money to bail out the countries in crisis . 
  thanks for the nuance . 
  of course it was unfair to put it on the same level as the great wars ( though in the end if the euro collapses it might cause economic damage on a similar scale ) . 
  it was a badly chosen facetious title . 
  i do n't think corrupt governments massively overborrowing and banks engaging in predatory lending to the people qualifies as benefitting greatly . 
  that 's like saying the americans who got homes in the subprime benefitted greatly by being able to live in a house for a few years , while that does n't nearly weigh up to being bankrupted or becoming a debt slave for the rest of your life . 
  there is a reason ` quantitative easing ' is in quotes in the article , because it 's not real [ quantitative easing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantitative_easing ) , it 's providing cheap loans to banks . 
  there is no buying of assets or government bonds which would help the southern countries directly . 
   quantitative easing ( qe ) is an unconventional monetary policy used by central banks to stimulate the economy when standard monetary policy has become ineffective . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] a central bank implements quantitative easing by buying specified amounts of financial assets from commercial banks and other private institutions , thus raising the prices of those financial assets and lowering their yield , while simultaneously increasing the monetary base . 
  ...  [ draghi says ecb still unlikely to engage in quantitative easing ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052702304163604579529160816731786 )  ecb president mario draghi 's comments -- to around 40 members of germany 's ruling grand coalition in the former capital of bonn -- may reassure germans , who are typically skeptical of such dramatic steps from central banks because of long-standing inflationary fears in europe 's largest economy . 
  but they could also spur doubt in financial markets about mr. draghi 's recent assurances that the central bank would weigh all stimulus measures , including large-scale bond purchases -- otherwise known as quantitative easing . 
  the inflation caused by creating money and giving it to the countries in crisis can be seen as a tax on all the holders of the euro , as all their money loses some value . 
  this means that it 's not targeting some countries more than others , it 's a tax on all euros . 
  not printing money while the us and japan do , means that the euro increases in value with respect to dollars and yen . 
  this means that it becomes more expensive for japan and the us to buy european products , which decreases demand . 
  for europe , american and japanese products become cheaper which makes us import more . 
  this leads to a trade imbalance . 
  if drastic measures are n't taken to really bail out the southern countries and drastic austerity is forced upon them then it 's inevitable that they will have to drop out of the euro . 
  with such a large part of their population being unemployed and seeing no hope , while suffering under austerity , the population will eventually vote for a separatist government . 
  if this does n't break up the rest of the euro , other countries ( france ) will follow because without a strong central bank policies , these imbalances between countries will keep on happening . 
  while it pales in comparison to the suffering caused by the great wars , the structurally unemployed are truly suffering and millions of young people are seeing their futures destroyed . 
  okay , i thought a controversial title might get some attention , and it was facetious . 
  i apologize , it was badly chosen, 
  do n't know if you 're being snide , but development of the poorer eu countries yields enormous returns for the richer countries in the long run . 
  as the economies develop and modernize they become more productive and buy more of our stuff . 
  furthermore , even though people keep shouting ` dey terk r jerbs ' , the cheap and disciplined labor provided by eastern europeans also gives a large boost to our economy . 
  also they often do jobs that many natives simply refuse to take . 
  in contrast to the muslim immigration waves , the eastern europeans do tend to go back home once they have made some money . 
  while they certainly played a large part in their current crisis , before the euro their currencies would have dropped enormously and they would n't have been able to go in so much debt . 
  as their currencies would have fallen their export would get a huge boost , because their products would become cheap for other european countries . 
  bad regulation and supervision by the eu also allowed these ( corrupt ) countries to take on irresponsible debts and join the euro before their economies were ready ( especially in the case of greece ) . 
  the reason the eu turned a blind eye is because before the crisis hit , the huge spending of the southern neighbors provided a huge boost to the northern economies . 
  now it 's the poor citizens who are paying the price for their inept governments and unfair euro system . 
  i 'm just xposting , not the creator , but i think it might be because there were multiple polls done , do n't know which were eventually used in the graphs .

  if we progress towards a society where most production is automated then increasingly many people will not be able to get paid work . 
  if people have no income then capitalism ca n't function . 
  a basic income guarantees that people who are unable to be productive can still spend money and the capitalist system will compete to get that money .
