but the quran is considered the start of the arabic language by the religionists , so that point is moot . 
  you are addressing the eritrean stabbers , right ? 
   this bias is clearly a result of the exact same dynamics that give men better access to power in our society . 
  feminists all agree that the notion that men ca n't or should n't work in nurseries and kindergartens is complete bullshit , and it 's important to understand where that bias comes from . 
  the bs continues . 
  no sir , it is not the males in power that hinder men doing these kinds of caretaking jobs , and it is certainly not the feminists who `` agree '' that they should . 
  au contraire . 
   again , this is a direct result of how heteronormativity and patriarchy view male sexuality . 
  it 's bullshit , and feminism is first to criticise it . 
  the stick that can always be used to bludgeon every argument to death . 
  again , a fantasy , and again : no , sir , feminists do not `` criticize '' this . 
  au contraire . 
   what is meant is that our culture actually legitimizes rape ... rape culture is a real problem . 
  oh , god , again with the bs . 
  no , rape is not `` culturally accepted '' . 
   it 's not `` racism '' in any meaningful sense of the word of course it is racism . 
  it specifically distinguishes on race only . 
   close to 100 % of black americans are descendants of slaves , and suffer the inherited consequences of that to this very day . 
  it 's not fucking `` racism '' to try and correct that , even if there are poor white people who should also have a chance . 
  at what point are the african-american descendants of the slaves abolished of their historic `` consequences '' and can be held accountable for their behaviour and actions ? 
  how many more years need to pass , how many more generations need to be born ? 
  when will it end ? 
  and again , of course affirmitive action is racist , because it is only based on race , nothing else !, 
  i was not addressing you , so there is no need to feel insulted . 
  i even apologized . 
  yet all you have left are petty insults . 
  pathetic . 
   i do n't think it needs to be removed for its content ( rather its aesthetic ) , but could you clarify why society needs that particular scribbling ? 
  because religion is an ideology , and ideologies should not be shielded from mockery . 
   i have some fundamentalist christian family members that require we say `` grace '' before a meal . 
  i go along with it because it is harmless , shows respect to a belief they hold dear ... 
  if they threatened you with violence if you did n't say `` grace '' , would you still be `` going along since they hold their belief so dear , let 's show some respect '' ? 
   `` fuck islam '' ... `` hurt '' ... `` attack '' ... `` insufferable dick '' ... `` edgy dickshit '' ... no matter how many `` ugly '' words you come up with , it will never come close to killing someone . 
   it is the fact that we can say what we want that is `` very '' necessary for society , not that we do . 
  you are confused . 
  only if we let ourselves not be censored , if we continue to speak out , and not hold in out of some false feeling of `` respect '' we will be able to speak out in the future . 
  if we do n't , we risk , and you are working on it with many others , that we self-censor . 
   what if i thought it was fruitless to aggravate religious folk ? 
  am i still caving in to terrorists ? 
  yes , because it is n't fruitless , it is very necessary . 
  excuse me . 
  even though the flag is tilted , i did assume you were cieloroto, 
   you are just deliberately trying to rile people up  of course ( and i should n't even have to say that ) that does n't justify violence at all you should spell it out , because the previous sentence you just admitted that you think it was charlie hebdo 's own doing . 
  you are just like the writers the article is about . 
  in short : you are not charlie . 
  what is wrong with `` deliberate mockery of religion '' , and why is this `` horror '' - apparently - only noted if it is about a specific religion ? 
  what you , and others , do not seem to get , is that with even a tacit `` understanding '' of the `` grievances '' , you are legitimizing their reaction . 
  you are acting exactly like the writers in the article . 
  you would never crawl and bow so cowardly if this were about christianity , buddhism , hinduism , any other religion . 
  admit it . 
   i do not in any way apologize or support senseless , religiously motivated violence . 
  you stated : `` an immature magazine that sold copies by cheap shock effects and spreading hate '' and you compared them to neo-nazis . 
  next you tried to compare a murder-spree with a reluctance to show monty python many years ago . 
  you are playing apologetics , whether you like me pointing it out or not . 
   `` this issue has nothing to do with an oppressed and disadvantaged minority . 
  it has everything to do with the battle against fanatical islam , which is highly organised , well funded , and which seeks to terrify us all , muslims as well as non muslims , into a cowed silence . '', 
   `` if you 're not with us , you 're with the terrorists '' well , you are , if you think that you should defend them ( the terrorists ) , which you clearly are doing here . 
   shunned ... vs.  killed ... yeah , sure , sounds `` familiar '' , apologetic idiot . 
  do n't be , we have our own : the [ wadden sea ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1314 ) ... 
  it is not `` racism '' if you are talking about prejudice against a veil-wearing woman , it is anti-muslim bigotry however . 
  get the difference into your thick skulls , darn it , it is essential . 
  the dillution and abuse of the term `` racism '' deeply worries me . 
  because it is a conspiracy to blame muslims , and make life even more apartheid/slavery like than it already is , easy , you see ? 
  it is not necessarily that . 
  as becomes obvious of his further postings , he knows next to nothing about the subject , islam , which happens a lot among the regressive leftists . 
  they suffer from something like : `` i seriously can not imagine anymore serious dedication to a belief than at the cafeteria level . '' . 
  which is why they always seek `` external '' reasons ( political , sociological etc. ) . 
  they simply can not imagine the fanaticism to be that fanatical , combined with sheer ignorance on the subject , especially the differences between islam and other religions . 
  not necessarily . 
  based on both being minors , you can annul the marriage and based on the same you can grant both asylum . 
  they were almost all `` held back '' by social-democrat ( forced ) partners in the bigger countries ( and probably for the better : the dampening ), 
  she simply should have let her attacker at an arms length away from her , then nothing would have happened . 
   it 's the way the jewish community felt when hitler was terrorising them . 
  that 's what the british are doing to muslims within britain . 
   actually leftists and antifa movements oppose the is very much i do n't believe this to be the case . 
  the ones that go over there feel attracted to the ypg/pkk because of i 's socialist/communist leanings and want to help them . 
  if isis only attacked assad 's forces and killed some yazidis every now and then , there would be no ideological reason to fight them , since assad `` is worse than anything else '' , and yazidis are `` who cares , collateral damage , not worth fighting for '' . 
  do n't obfuscate the radical lefts real agenda ( pro-palestine , no matter what atrocities they commit , pro-muslim/islam , because they are brothers in their anti-capitalism/anti-colonialism ) . 
  apparently there are some . 
   the german leftists/antifa members fighting is in syria what ? 
  source please ... what `` leftists/antifa 's '' are fighting in syria ? 
  everything i hear from those extremists is a whining `` leave them poor muslims alone , you islamophobe racist !, 
  because they are , mostly , very conservative catholics with unpleasant memories of communism . 
  yes . 
  but i doubt much will effectively change if he is allowed to keep preaching/reaching out .

   greece rated itself the hardest working . 
  hahahahahahahahah ... oh , they were actually being serious about that ? 
  you may not realize it , but you think very lowly of `` them '' . 
  it is called `` the racism of low expectations '' . 
  so , at what point would it be necessary to react ? 
  how many deaths ( oh , no , sorry , they are just a meaningless drop in the ocean ) , how atrocious does it have to become ( oh , no , sorry it could never be worse than `` what we did to them '' ) , how close to home does it have to get ( oh , no , sorry , you would treat the decapitation of your mother on the street as if she had fallen off the stairs at home , `` nothing to worry about , shit happens '' ) . 
  it definitely is a war , the battlefield just has n't reached you yet , so you do n't give a shit . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , they are offering frisolac/friso since the 60s there already . 
  https://www.frisianflag.com/en/nutritious-products/friso/ i remember being `` namecalled '' by kids with indonesian descent who kept calling me `` frisolac ! '', 
  laughingly in primary school ( my first name is friso ) and i never understood what they meant until they explained it to me one day . 
  yes , frisolac or friso baby milkpowder, 
  the biology ones were quite nice , but very much dated if you rewatch them . 
  the space ones are way too out there . 
  and , i paraphrase : `` democracy is like a train , you use it to reach your destination , then you get off '',
