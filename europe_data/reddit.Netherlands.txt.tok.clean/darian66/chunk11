   belgium also knew about the mass contamination in june but ** kept it secret for nearly two months because of a criminal investigation ** . 
  it should be noted that the same applied to the netherlands . 
  a criminal investigation was ongoing and thus the decision was made not to inform the public . 
   letting millions of eggs contanimated with a cancer causing poison and then exporting them is not exactly `` cucumber time '' news . 
  i do n't know if you like it in the netherlands , but most other people prefer their eggs poison-free . 
   like i said , the '' poison '' is not that dangerous . 
  yes , it would be unwise to consume eggs that contain a large portion of fipronil , but the effects are negligible until you eat more eggs than ** you 're recommended portion ** . 
  so you 'd be eating unhealthy anyway if you were consuming the amount of eggs needed to have any fipronil related impact . 
   the netherlands just fyi , you do n't need to capitalize the t in the netherlands . 
  what a ridiculous comment . 
  this egg '' crisis '' is pure ` cucumber time ' news . 
  it completely pales in comparison to brexit negotiations . 
  you 'd need to eat 348 eggs per day , for every day of your life , to be in any danger . 
  moreover , how do you '' almost '' fire someone ? 
  i think he 's referring to the eggs , not the nvwa . 
  because the bastard is constantly trying to drown us !, 
  you 're dodging the question . 
  are they european or not ? 
  how lucky are we that we share a country with a man like aboutaleb instead of someone like you . 
  it 's fascinating how you and i have such an extremely different perception of everyday life in europe :, 
   the zeitgeist is changing and thankfully it 's not towards an altruistic and self destructive one . 
  my god , you can not be serious . 
  do you seriously think that supporting identitarians is a thing to be applauded ? 
  what 's your point ? 
  not really though , since after that , the ten days ' campaign happened . 
  if it was n't for french intervention and the polish uprising , your independence might have come much later . 
  to be honest , they did n't . 
  during the ten day campaign we soundly defeated the belgians , and their army was destroyed . 
  besides the siege of the citadel of antwerp , there was n't any combat between dutch and french forces . 
  we withdrew before our army made proper contact with the french . 
  no , it 's definitely knowledge . 
  with the knowledge we can get it back . 
  klm is considered vital to our national security and our economy . 
  our government reserves the right to intervene in commercial business if those two are threatened . 
  well , the pole-complain site got *** 40,000 complaints *** . 
  take that as you will . 
  the site has been removed from the pvv site after they lost the 2012 elections . 
   everybody knows you 're ashamed for losing . 
  it 's ok to admit it . 
  last time i checked , both of our countries were also involved in that war . 
  so we lost it as much as the americans did . 
  they did alright in rotterdam though . 
  no , but they are part of the german command structure . 
  one might compare it to nato . 
  '' , but czech forces would be under the command of saceur if a large conflict were to break out . 
  edit : moreover , i ca n't speak for romania or the czech republic , but germany certainly has some political control over the dutch units , just as we have a degree of political control over theirs . 
  for example , if germany wanted to shift 1st panzer divisions hq over to spechtberg , our government could say '' guy 's , we prefer the hq being closer to the netherlands , can we discuss this ? '' . 
  once you enter this level of integration , certain cooperation structures are created that ensure that both nations have control over what happens whilst limiting the damage to operational readiness . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_army , http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_141113.htm explanation for the diagram : what you are looking at is the organisation structure of the german army ( * deutsches heer * ) . 
  as you can see there are three [ divisions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/division_\\ ( military \\ ) ) ( consisting of consisting of between 10,000 and 20,000 soldiers ) marked xx , each divided into four or five [ brigades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brigade ) ( 2,000 -- 4,000 soldiers ) marked x. 
  these brigades themselves consist of a number of [ battalions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battalion ) ( 300 to 1,000 soldiers ) of the 12 brigades shown , four are from other european countries , and one is the multinational franco-german brigade . 
  two brigades are from the netherlands , one from the czech republic , and one from romania . 
  however it should be noted that the integration process is still ongoing . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  are military high schools comparable to military schools ( jrotc ) in the united states ? 
   also about 16 thousands students were also purged ( due to goverment closing down the military highschools ) . 
  so what does '' purged '' mean in this context ? 
  were the students simply sent home , or locked up ? 
  also does that mean that turkey currently has no officer school ? 
  time will tell who is right . 
  yes i am very sure . 
  advancements in electronic warfare continue to outpace those made in the unmanned field of things . 
  just look at the rq-170 incident with iran . 
  moeroever , so far all bids in the f/a-xx feature both manned and unmanned versions , with the emphasis being on manned . 
  as for the article about india , what they are doing is not different from what the u.s has been doing with the qf-4 . 
  20 - 30 years is way too early . 
  unmanned fighter aircraft are more in the 2075-2100 ballpark . 
   this does not mean we give less rights or someone else is less human because of them . 
  problem is that your theory is used by a lot of people that do think that way . 
  really ~ ~ dude ~ ~ geezer, 
  it 's also most definitely a / r/thenetherlands thing ... 
  israeli navy is actually larger than ours . 
  smh , how far we have fallen . 
  and that place is ? 
  probably salty over the abc islands . 
   the sensory equipment is major , but it is neither french nor german , but domestically produced . 
  it 's still a french company . 
   the air mobile brigade does n't use boxers or fenneks . 
   so saying ` only one brigade uses cv90 's ' is pretty none telling when there are only 2 brigades , of which only one is mechanized . 
  ( which happens to use the cv90 's ) the 11th does use fenneks . 
  my point still stands . 
  boxers are used by both brigades , and are thus certainly more mainstay than the cv90 's . 
  yeah , yes . 
   if that 's what constitutes a major weapon system in your opinion . 
  sure germans can produce a gun , the belgians too , we should always pick the best . 
  when it comes to major weapon systems though , they either ca n't make it , or try it and end up with an inferior expensive product . 
  yes , our service rifle is a pretty major piece of equipment . 
  moreover , you 're moving the goalposts . 
  you were talking about '' inferior '' equipment . 
  if the hk416 was inferior , it would n't be as popular with military forces , lea 's , and civilians , around the world . 
  lets look at some of our equipment and their german/french counterparts . 
  you tell me what exactly is inferior about the german/french stuff : what we use | what the french/germans have to offer ----------- | ------------------------------------- sm-1mr / sm-2mr | aster 15 and aster 30 / harpoon | mbda mm-40 exocet block 3 cv90 | puma/vbci apache | tiger patriot | samp/t c-130 | a400 there currently is n't a french/german equivalent of the chinook , although one is rumored to be in development . 
  we 're already purchasing the f-35 , so comparing the f-16 to the rafale is pointless . 
  our future refueling aircraft will be french/german ( airbus ) . 
  so where does the inferiority factor in , according to you ? 
   the sensory equipment is from thales netherlands , which is indeed a french subsidiary , but apart from that has very little frenchness to it . 
  the major equipment in frigates is american . 
  the torpedo 's , and missile systems . 
  the ship could n't function without the sensors . 
  it would n't be able to detect , track or engage any targets without the thales equipment , let alone properly navigate .
