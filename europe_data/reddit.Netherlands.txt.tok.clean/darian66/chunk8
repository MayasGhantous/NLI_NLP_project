  however speaking with a united voice ( that of a federal europe ) allows us to directly counterbalance the ( economic ) influence of the rising ( super ) powers that will dominate the international theater in this century and the next . 
  almost three quarters of my country 's gdp is generated abroad . 
  if we can no longer enact influence on a global scale , we 're fucked . 
  we need the global relevance to ensure our prosperity . 
  yeah , i get that people are angry/emotional , but the amount of shit slinging on this sub has increased enormously . 
  this sub has really decreased in quality since the start of the refugee crisis . 
  it used to be more civil and humorous . 
  now its all just doom , gloom , and bitter debates . 
   holland ( probably meant as whole netherlands though ) this is why we like you guys . 
  well the netherlands have been world cup runners 5 times and also have a better record at the european championship . 
  that we agree on . 
  its usually pannekoek when used as a curse . 
  you 're right though . 
  so when do we get ahead of the curve ? 
   perpetrators were most likely known to police i thought this was a rather large group of perpetrators ? 
  at least then it would gaet oan . 
  do n't know what you 're talking about op . 
  classes had to be canceled because of excessive snow today . 
  yeah we do this in nl too . 
  exactly , imagine a superpower that actually tries to enforce international law and protects human rights . 
  yes that is the situation now . 
  however i rue the day you guys realize that you are getting the short end of the stick regarding defense spending / our interests now longer align . 
  and that 's exactly why i 'm in favour of a european superstate . 
  no , i 'm saying that europe needs to be able to exert its own strong influence to protect its interests . 
  i think europe needs to be able to stand independent from the united states and china . 
  because we still have global interests . 
  we need to be able to act if things go bad in south america or africa , because due to the ever increasing globalization we will feel it in our wallets , political landscape and daily lives if shit goes down . 
  well in the case of the netherlands , a really large part of our wealth comes from the export and import . 
  when international trade is impacted negatively , it will immediately show on our balance . 
  having foreign influence and guarding our interest is paramount for us . 
  the netherlands also had the largest navy in the world during our most prosperous era . 
  individually , european countries simply does not have the power to compete with the really big players anymore . 
  you 're sabotaging our list-war, 
  dude ... 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  [ looks like a proper mountain to me ] ( http://www.sabatourism.com/images/homepage1.jpg ) . 
  i 'm not sure what you want to see but here are some news articles of municipalities declining . 
  point being ? 
  i 'm talking about the netherlands here . 
  this is still inexcusable behavior . 
  so far this year these people have caused more trouble and public unrest than the immigrants they are so afraid of . 
  food for thought . 
  you know perfectly well as i do what kind of people they are . 
  these are the same brand as the guys in schaarsbergen . 
  if an azc was opening in my neighborhood , i 'd be more worried about these kind of protesters than the immigrants themselves . 
  well once elections come , they can vote the pvv into power . 
  until then , they will just have to suck it up . 
  that 's not true , they have the right to say no , which often happens . 
  united kingdom , i feel like culturally they 're the closest to us ( after belgium ) . 
  this is a liveblog . 
  it is in dutch , but the videos and images should give you a pretty good view of what is happening . 
  -- during a community meeting and information event at the town hall , hundreds of protesters assembled outside . 
  after a while these protesters breached the ( pre placed ) barriers around the town hall in an attempt to storm the building . 
  within minutes riot police were in place to defend the building . 
  initially the meeting proceeded , but the mayor and the municipal council were evacuated after the police started firing warning shots . 
  ah , thanks for the heads up . 
  gedogen is like turning a blind eye to something . 
  gedoogbeleid is what we call our drug policy . 
  technically marijuana is illegal in the nl . 
  however you will not get arrested for smoking it and you can buy it in coffeeshops . 
  i gedoog my daughter smoking : i do n't like that my daughter is smoking , but i wo n't do anything about it . 
  ( i used this example because its literally what the dictionary says . ), 
  however christian values like pro-life , anti-same sex marriage etc. 
  are just as foreign to us as islam is . 
  christianity might still have a significant presence in our architecture etc , our current day core values greatly differ from christianity . 
  that 's why i don ' t find national identity to be synonymous with christianity . 
  we '' gedoog '' them , just like we gedoog the sgp . 
  the sgp is a is an orthodox protestant calvinist political party . 
  they are against abortion , same-sex marriage and see woman inferior to men ( sounds familiar ? ) . 
  however they are an accepted political party with seats in both the upper and lower house . 
  i do n't exactly agree with your remarks about national identity , especially your point about christianity . 
  a majority of the population in nl has no religious affiliation . 
  however i do agree that speaking a different language with your friends and family and only interacting with other moroccans/turks/antillean 's hampers integration . 
  sure , especially the folks from our former colonies . 
  i think in general people in the netherlands do n't really give a shit what culture others adhere to . 
  i think most white dutch also have different cultural values . 
  that is a result of centuries mercantile and explorative spirit . 
  we have constantly been exposed to other cultures . 
  that makes it really hard to pinpoint one exact dutch culture . 
  however we find it important that everybody follows the main cultural points of the nation , as in tolerance of others , individual liberty , freedom etc. 
  yeah i know , i 'm just busting his balls . 
  i think you have to take mandatory counseling in germany , that might not be easy if they are living in poland . 
  better to go to scandinavia or the benelux . 
   republican traditions well they probably should n't emigrate to a country that has had a monarchy for the last 200 years if they feel so strong about republicanism . 
  what is your point then ? 
  no of course someone can not become germanic just by moving to the netherlands , absolutely no one thinks that . 
  the point of this article is that these guys do not feel dutch , as in dutch national . 
  not that they do not feel white . 
  and seeing them as morrocan/turkish/whatever until they have made '' an honest effort to act dutch '' ( whatever that may be ) will not help them integrate . 
  what i mean is that one of the things that is so defining of america , is that everyone regardless of origin or colour is american . 
  people are asian - ** american ** , african - ** american ** , irish - ** american ** etc. 
  here we have the issue that people are either dutch , or surinamese , antillean , turkish etc. 
  ridiculous , it is n't a contest . 
  besides how would that work with america ? 
  do n't you guys pride yourselves with the fact that everybody is american first , country of origin second ? 
  friesland annexed half the north and overijssel ? 
  the feeling i get is that a lot of people actually just want a unified foreign policy/military , which is something that we might see happening this century . 
  i completely agree with you . 
  a united europe is needed to provide some balance to the coming domination of the other ( upcoming ) superpowers . 
  i prefer being ruled by a superpower that shares my culture ande history and wherein i still have some influence by vote .
