  way better than being america 's / china 's / brazil 's / india 's bitch . 
  i remember vividly russia downright annexing crimea . 
  do you realize how absurd it is that a piece of ukraine now has another colour in the atlas due to another nation taking it by force ? 
  another thing i quite vividly remember is national mourning and convoy of 40 hearses heading to hilversum . 
  russia can go eat an absolutely massive dick . 
   the economy is practically irreverent . 
  better to be poor and happy than rich and miserable . 
  i bet being rich makes you a lot more likely to be happy than being poor though . 
  well i for one would not be conformable with the prospect of my family sitting in some dodgy refugee camp in turkey or lebanon for a year while i struggle to find well paying job in a new country . 
   it 's not smaller but better equipped units - it is smaller and as poorly equipped units . 
  the french armed forces are just too broke to do something else and ** have been underfunded for enough time to be good at `` surgical operations ** '' . 
  is n't that exactly the opposite of what the article is saying ? 
  what was your view of operation deliberate force ? 
  what was it like being on the opposing end of that operation ? 
  no problem , i do n't really expect this to become reality anyway . 
  i still have some faith in the eu . 
  i gather you were a regular in the serbian military ? 
  this is not expelling the majority of the members , this is guaranteeing free movement of people and goods regardless of what will happen to the greater schengen area . 
   it 's not starting when we 've already been together for decades and you decide to expell us all from our own union . 
  its france that is talking about changing schengen , this is only a reaction to that . 
  schengen is still a big deal . 
  for many people it 's the best thing the eu has to offer . 
  while understandable , i feel like this is a major step back for europe . 
  no , i 'm saying that you might as well say that it would n't be really different if the pm brings the king with him instead of a stadtholder or president or whatever . 
  could n't you make that same argument against a president ? 
  what a nice attitude . 
  statement taken out of context are also not worthy of recognition . 
  whether you agree with my personal beliefs on the development of the european economies is n't important . 
  however it is important that people spread the correct information . 
  because most of the top rated comments are from people that clearly have n't read the article , or people taking the quote out of context . 
   small does not somehow imply bad . 
  if the uk will become per capita mid-size , especially compared to brazil , india , nigeria , china , india etc. , then it 's a major problem . 
  of course it does n't . 
  however the uk has an ambitious foreign policy . 
  britain 's hard power and thus its ability to protect its interest will naturally decline with rise the of bric . 
  i think that 's aimed at some brexit supporters that expect the uk to become more closer with the anglosphere instead of europe . 
  i do n't follow . 
  i 'm simply making a statement based on current developments . 
  please read the article . 
  he means in the in the middle of the atlantic ocean as a metaphor , meaning that the uk would be stuck in limbo between the uk and the eu qua diplomatic relations . 
  & gt ; speaking in an interview at the dutch ambassador 's residence in tokyo on monday , rutte said that an exit from the eu would mean the u.k. ** becoming ** `` a mid-sized economy in the middle of the atlantic ocean , in neither america nor europe . 
  and you 're daft if you think that 's wrong . 
  all the countries of europe will become small economies compared to countries like brazil , india , nigeria , china , india etc.

  the quote in the title is taken out of context . 
  in the article it says :  rutte said that an exit from the eu would mean the u.k. ** becoming ** `` a mid-sized economy in the middle of the atlantic ocean , in neither america nor europe . '' he does n't mean that the uk is a mid-sized economy right now . 
  it obviously is n't . 
  however in 2070 it will be , while the eu would most likely still be one of the largest centers of economic activity in the world . 
  that 's because the quote in the title is taken out of context . 
  in the article it says :  rutte said that an exit from the eu would mean the u.k. ** becoming ** `` a mid-sized economy in the middle of the atlantic ocean , in neither america nor europe . '', 
  12th biggest economy in the world though !, 
  and 6th largest of the eu !, 
  furthermore , we 're already a near united front when it comes to foreign affair . 
  best to leave each other 's internal affairs to our respective people . 
  because of that sweet 23,1 million population and that 1,1 trillion gdp . 
  the ambitious start of our new united kingdom of the netherlands !, 
  i would n't call them far right , but they do have some questionable views . 
   marine le pen described russian president vladimir putin as a `` defender of the christian heritage of european civilisation . '', 
  the national front considers that ukraine has been subjugated by the united states , through the ukrainian crisis . 
  the national front denounces anti-russian feelings in eastern europe and the submission of western europe to nato 's interests in the region . 
  regardless of his motives , it 's inexcusable . 
  yep , they start of strong and then everybody remembers what an absolute joke of a governing party they would be . 
  and of course we have the age old phenomenon of pvv supporters not voting . 
  the pvv had there chance , they ruined it by walking out of the catshuis negotiations . 
  those mean nothing , the pvv always lead the polls and then proceeds to always shit the bed . 
   does n't have to , they technically represent their voters , as your party does yours . 
  yes , and my head of state represents me on the council of europe , and the 27 other voters represent their own people on the council . 
  the second sentence of your article :  it 's unclear whether commanders who unleashed the ac-130 gunship on the hospital -- killing at least 22 patients and hospital staff -- were aware that the site was a hospital or knew about the allegations of possible enemy activity . 
  the same could be argued for our own parliament . 
  even though i voted for the vvd , i 'm also being represented by 38 pvda ` rs . 
  we 're in the top 6 european nation by refugee population . 
  wait , when is someone english and when is someone british according to you ? 
  would n't someone born in england be english ? 
   the european union ( eu ) has been called an emerging superpower by academics . 
  [ 6 ] [ 56 ] many scholars and academics like t. r. reid , [ 57 ] andrew reding , [ 58 ] andrew moravcsik , [ 59 ] mark leonard , [ 60 ] jeremy rifkin , [ 61 ] john mccormick , [ 62 ] and some politicians like romano prodi [ 63 ] and tony blair , [ 64 ] believe that the eu either is , or will become , a superpower in the 21st century . 
   john mccormick believes that the eu has already achieved superpower status , based on the size and global reach of its economy and on its global political influence . 
  he argues that the nature of power has changed since the cold war-driven definition of superpower was developed , and that military power is no longer essential to great power ; he argues that control of the means of production is more important than control of the means of destruction , and contrasts the threatening hard power of the united states with the opportunities offered by the soft power wielded by the european union of course others disagree :  barry buzan notes that the eu 's potential superpower status depends on its `` stateness '' . 
  it is unclear though how much state-like quality is needed for the eu to be described as a superpower . 
  buzan states that the eu is unlikely to remain a potential superpower for a long time because although it has material wealth , its `` political weakness and its erratic and difficult course of internal political development , particularly as regards a common foreign and defence policy '' constrains it from being a superpower . 
  [ 21 ]  alexander stubb , the finnish foreign minister , has said that he thinks the eu is both a superpower and not a superpower . 
  while the eu is a superpower in the sense that it is the largest political union , single market and aid donor in the world , it is not a superpower in the defense or foreign policy spheres . 
  like barry buzan , alexander stubb thinks that the major factor constraining the eu 's rise to superpower status is its lack of statehood in the international system ; other factors are its lack of internal drive to project power worldwide , and continued preference for the sovereign nation-state among some europeans . 
  to counterbalance these , he urged the eu leaders to approve and ratify the lisbon treaty ( which they did in 2009 ) , create an eu foreign ministry ( eeas , established in 2010 ) , develop a common eu defense , hold one collective seat at the united nations security council and g8 , and address what he described as the `` sour mood '' toward the eu prevalent in some european countries today . 
  [ 75 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potential_superpowers#european_union  eu as an organization has absolutely zero international power how come the eu is traditionally seen as the block with the most '' soft-power '' then ? 
  sounds like an opportunity to restore * recht en order * in our former colony . 
   the type 45 is a destroyer class geared towards air defence so is the zeven provinci\u00ebn though , except that it is a frigate of course .
