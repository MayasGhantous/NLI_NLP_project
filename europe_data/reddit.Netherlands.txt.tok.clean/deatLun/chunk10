  you want them to be forced to be paid more to incentivize paying natives who refuse to downscale their lifestyle instead . 
  that 's equality for the workers , and still also protectionism . 
  i 'm remaining right on point , if you put a little less effort into making strawman arguments and more into reading , this conversation may yet lead somewhere . 
   a market where cheaper labor comes in as as free as can be . 
  it is n't , since it legally prohibits locals from competing . 
  if you want a free market then remove minimum wages , or instate a minimum wage for everybody . 
   you 'd prefer more english people to have jobs , at the cost of companies , unfairly . 
  it 's literally protectionism . 
  i prefer equality , not protectionism . 
  i 'm pro free-trade , which is why i 'm anti-eu . 
  i guess they generally are . 
  but a free market is intended to create an equal playing field , not an unequal one which is what the eu is doing with labour markets . 
  ca n't comment on the equation with the english elite , but merkel is probably the worst thing that has happened to the european project since its inception . 
  the underclass ca n't compete because they are n't allowed to work for sub-minimum wage while easterners are . 
  easterners working in western europe should be paid the same wage as locals . 
  which is relevant , how ? 
  criminals are more likely to be poor . 
   because foreigners are ~ ~ willing ~ ~ ** allowed ** to work for less because [ . . ] fixed it for you . 
  everybody should be equal in front of the law , the eu made sure people were n't equal and even though there are commissioners proposing to change that eastern memberstates oppose equality . 
  you can ridicule them , but from their perspective they made the right choice to vote to leave . 
  the monarchy is actually quite popular in the netherlands , we ` put up with it ' because we consider it a stable factor in politics/international relations and because it 's a binding factor both in european netherlands and the caribbean netherlands . 
  65 % of the dutch people want to remain a monarchy and only 16 % want to become a republic [ 1 ] ( http://nos.nl/data/image/2016/04/26/277310/864x486.jpg ) , and 66 % of the people have quite a lot to a lot of confidence in the king . 
  try finding a president with so much support . 
   example , sending our king to china for relations , is considered a noble gesture , as opposed to sending a elected minister . 
  we do n't elect ministers . 
  just doing my civic duty , no problem . 
  oh yes , i advise frenchies on a 35 hour week to look elsewhere . 
  not offended , no worries . 
  if one really wants to ( legally ) emigrate to the us it 's possible of course ( where there 's a will there 's a way ) , but australia/new zealand is generally easier , and just as pretty and wealthy . 
  it only misses that us vibe and greatness . 
  i 'm not emigrating anywhere illegally . 
  i do n't want other people immigrating illegally here either , they still do it , but i will stick to the law and my principles . 
  sure you 've issues , i would prefer the us over europe though . 
  it 's pretty hard to migrate to the us though . 
  it 's been exactly 5 years since the breivik terrorist attack . 
  in his/her defense though , he targeted youth from a political party . 
  he 's not saying it should be outlawed . 
  it makes no sense to hold another referendum . 
  either follow the referendum or ignore it , do n't be an ass about it . 
  japanese are actually quite fond of europeans . 
  but you would stand out a bit too much , you recieve loads of positive attention , but i would n't prefer that for more than the duration of a holiday . 
  very much so , luckily as probably half the netherlands , i have family in new zealand . 
  finishing my last year for my bachelor degree now , i 'm thinking of emigrating when i 'm finished . 
  at least [ one shooter ] ( https://twitter.com/0xuid/status/756542803627433985/video/1 ) appears to be of middle eastern origin , do n't know about the other two . 
  what is ` stationary care ' ? 
   the europe of my childhood is gone . 
  i do not recognize this new europe . 
  i 'm starting to feel the same way , luckily we ( the netherlands ) have been left of the hook so far , but i 'm keeping a door open to get out of this continent if this goes south . 
  one of the shooters as it seems . 
  i had a friend from israel over a few weeks back , she was born in france but migrated after her education , and she said israel is/feels safer than france . 
   as you stated yourself , keeping him segregated from other prisoners can help . 
  problem is about 50 % of the prison population has an islamic background ( in the netherlands at least ) , 45 % of the belgian prison population is muslim , 35 % of italy etc. 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.vlaamsbelang.org/nieuws/10089 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://ejbron.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/moslims-oververtegenwoordigd-in-britse-en-italiaanse-gevangenissen/ ) , so this can only be done with a limited amount of people . 
  if he 's confirmed incapacitated for labour he could be on a welfare . 
  not a french though ( and do n't know about their particular laws ), 
  yes i think [ so ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/life_imprisonment#/media/file:lifesentencemapnew.svg ) . 
  but we have it as well and it 's very rarely used . 
  the man who murdered pim fortuyn for example has been released a while back . 
  i very much doubt he would 've been sentenced to life , none of his victims died ( luckily so ) but that reduces the punishment quite substantially . 
  but lets say he would 've been , would that have been a preferable outcome ? 
  having people at work for him , him occupying space and being fed for the rest of his life ? 
  i personally prefer the current outcome , he 's put to ground and forgotten about . 
  yes , really . 
   82 % want more european action on the fight against terrorism . 
  77 % of the european citizens asked for more european action in the fight against unemployment . 
  75 % of the european citizens asked for more european action in the fight against tax fraud . 
  74 % of the european people ask for more european action on the issue of migration . 
  insert anything for ` european ' and you 'll get the same results . 
   referendum against what ? 
  could you cite the relevant referendums ? 
  what are you even talking about in your opinion ? 
  * 55 % of the french are against a european constitution . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_european_constitution_referendum,_2005 ) * 62 % of the dutch are against a european constitution . 
  [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_european_constitution_referendum,_2005 ) * 53 % of the danes were against the euro . 
  [ 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_related_to_the_european_union ) * 56 % of the swedes were against the euro . 
  [ 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_related_to_the_european_union ) lucky for them , they did n't bother to ask the rest . 
  * 53 % of the irish were against the treaty of lisbon . 
  [ 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_related_to_the_european_union ) * 53 % of the danes voted in 2015 to keep the opt-out on justice and home affairs . 
  [ 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_related_to_the_european_union ) ) * 52 % of the british voted to leave the european union , 74 % of the swiss voted against joining the eu , 54 % of the nores voted against joining the eu . 
  any time they ask the people they reject , you 're completely senseless if you then go on claiming the people are , and even ever were , on board with this prestige project . 
   the only people who ever voted against being in the eu were the british just now . 
  and they are already getting fucked by and regretting it . 
  i 'm sorry to hear you 've so little knowledge of the history of the european project , i hope my explanation on your previous point helps you out a bit . 
   they are n't what ? 
  proof of what i said has already been provided . 
  in the meantime you are just making baseless claims . 
  where is your proof for any of this ? 
  go on , cite it . 
  just read , i 'm not typing in cyrilic . 
   all countries are compatible . 
  they are populated by humans and humans are all the same . 
  the only difference is their education . 
  which can change . 
  oh boy , i do n't know were to start . 
  this is going way above you . 
  so he would 've gotten of with 4 years in jail , radicalize fellow inmates , and make the next victims ? 
  i 'm glad he 's dead , it made the world a tiny bit of a better place . 
   and why do they mean jackshit ? 
   because they 're suggestive hollow questions . 
   and where is your proof of that ?
