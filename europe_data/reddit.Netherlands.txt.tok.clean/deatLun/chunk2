  in europe it is common you need to register your company at a chamber of commerce stating a company goal and activities . 
  certain activities are limited to licenses . 
  just because you own a private enterprise does n't mean you can do everything commercial you want to . 
   same way that a gas station in the netherlands does not sell alcohol but is designated a convenience store . 
  so a gas station is n't allowed to sell alcohol , does this principle seem familiar to you ? 
   can any french weigh in on weather the weather is a bit cloudy and rainy in the north , centre and south-west at 20-24 degrees celcius , but sunny and warm in the south-east at 30-32 degrees . 
  no , it 's a ` general goods store ' . 
  i was referring to the failed attempt at your integration . 
   huh ? 
  okay , why are games produced en masse in countries like canada , america , and japan , where salaries are quite high , while relatively few games are made in eastern europe or india for that matter ? 
   because salaries do n't determine labour costs . 
  labour costs are a combination of taxes/regulation , labour efficiency , labour pool and income .

   not familiar with what blm is ... euhm , [ this ] ( https://badatheist.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dba823c4bdbbaa6a893f27fb4f225ea2.jpg ) ? 
   so is the amount of work that goes into triple a games . 
  as noted it 's a labour intensive business , not a capital intensive one . 
   you enumerating all these huge kinda departments and acting like they 're little things . 
  because they are , compared to other markets . 
   game industry is extremely competitive and developers have a high rate of failure . 
  game industry is n't competitive at all . 
  let 's just look at an income statement from ea games , probably one of the more popular ones . 
   gaap total net revenue $ 4,464 [ in millions q1 2016 ]  gaap net income $ 1,154 [ in millions q1 2016 ] [ 1 ] ( http://www.ea.com/news/electronic-arts-reports-q1-fy17-financial-results ) that 's insane , over 25 % of the net revenue remains at the bottom line , name me an industry where that 's common . 
  [ i 'll help you ] ( http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/new_home_page/datafile/margin.html ) get started with some us branch statistics . 
  yes . 
  no it is n't . 
  if labour would be ` expensive ' , assuming you mean more expensive than in countries where many games aren ; t produced , they would n't be produced there . 
  they had more slaves than europeans in their history . 
   are as fair as calling golden dawn the ` european right ' . 
  except golden dawn is a fringe party , and this is the established stream of the european left . 
   organiser joshua virasami told the bbc black people should come together `` to achieve justice and equality in britain and all over the world '' . 
   joshua virasami let 's take a look , shall we . 
   ` europe , you mean that racist cabal of neocolonial reactionary states ? ',

  neither coloniality nor capitalism can break the roots of community . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://twitter.com/joshuavirasami ) this is the european left in a nutshell , i think many people will want this aspect to be added to their ranks . 
  i 'm not , germany has very strict enforcement of piracy and an absence of personal information protection and is known for its media corporations to harrass internet users with lawsuits and threats to pay them money * or else * . 
  it 's not expensive to make games , especially selling them is extremely cheap . 
  you need some computer equipment , a team of programmers , a few designers and story writers , and a media campaign . 
  in every branch there are examples of products or companies that are not huge financial successes or just plain failures , that 's how our economic system works . 
  in terms of assets , producing games is easy , it 's a labour intensive product , not capital intensive . 
  comparing prices to historic sales also lacks reference , the fact prices dropped does n't mean they 're not overly inflated anymore . 
  [ alright ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/83235000/jpg/_83235981_camerongurdwara.jpg ) i looked , no assimilation there , but multiculturialism . 
   you can not say they do n't have their own culture - they have their own music , cuisine , film , language and religion , all of which they follow here . 
  you 're explaining the essence of multiculturialism . 
  i concur , i will not subsidies [ this ] ( https://villasincapetown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/product899-000.jpg ) , or [ this ] ( http://static3.therichestimages.com/cdn/568/454/90/cw/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tswifthouse1.jpg ) . 
  they can live in a quarter of the space and ask for 15 euro for a game and 5 euro for a movie . 
  some people recieve a few million less because people use torrentz , instead these people should pay 60 euro for a game or 20 euro for a movie , otherwise they ca n't remain lavishly rich forever , which is a problem the law needs to solve . 
  and they lived happily ever after .

  where is germany going then ? 
  they are mutually exclusive . 
  end talks , end their potential membership status , negotiate a new cooled down relation and treat them as they behave . 
  their employers do n't pay the government dole , they have offices in the virgin islands , channel islands , bermuda , luxemburg and what have you to see to that . 
  it does n't really matter even if 75 % spends the rest of their life on welfare , the middle class will pay for them and the other 25 % will do what they want them to do , suppress wages , keep housing prices sky-high and that sort of thing . 
  there are multiple options . 
  let them boil in their own stew . 
  they give expression in this way to the religion that does though . 
  not all nazi 's gassed or executed jews either . 
  i 'm not sure why we needed poland and the other eastern states either . 
  but different people have different visions for the eu . 
  and melila , pe\u00f1\u00f3n de v\u00e9lez de la gomera , perejil island , isla del rey , isla isabel ii , isla del congreso , isla de mar , isla de terra and pe\u00f1\u00f3n de alhucemas . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plazas_de_soberan%c3%ada#/media/file:mapa_del_sur_de_espa%c3%b1a_neutral.png ) and wider around africa there 's the st helena islands on the west coast , bouvet island to the south , mayotte and reunion to the south-east and the french southern and arctic territories . 
  it 's true what he says though , british favor multiculturialism and the french favour assimilation . 
  though in the end neither have a say in the matter as minorities go their own way . 
  and lesbians do n't blow , shoot , overrun with a truck , cut , axe , stone or crucify people for being different . 
  i think the analogy fails on multiple fronts . 
  mr. chamberlain ? 
  is that you ? 
  compared to most of the world greece is a paradise . 
  i see we 've surpassed your attention span . 
  perhaps , the waterpark itself does n't really interest me , it 's the steady return to medieval times that does . 
  first they came for the women , they needed to cover themselves up toe to nose , i was n't a woman , then they came for the gays , lesbians and transgenders , they needed to be thrown from buildings , i was n't an lgbt , then they came for the heathens , i was a heathen , but there was no one left to defend me . 
  it 's for a single day ... 
  it 's for a single week ... 
  it 's for a single month ... 
  it 's for a single year ... yea , for goodness sake indeed . 
   so , you are comfortable in your `` safety '' from them yes i feel comfortable in my safety , i also feel comfortable in our progressive modern society where we respect everybody 's orientation , rights , choices , where we ensure each other of a basic standard in living , where we look out for each other . 
  where we solve disagreement with words , concensus and with logic i feel most comfortable when such a society is managed sustainably by only allowing new members who can expected to be , are demanded to be , and will have to be compatible with such an environment and be expected to either help maintain it by contributing to it , or profit from it by living respectfuly in our ranks both in fair and well thought out balance . 
   for such a wounded country as greece oh please , the country is a paradise compared to 90 % of the world . 
   i am , however , at a complete loss how the people in this article have come to the opinion really ? 
  it 's quite simple , they do n't travel from turkey to sweden , netherlands or germany to escape war , they come for free monies and a free house . 
  they do n't get that in greece . 
  hence they would rather go home . 
   they are escaping horrific war , it 's apparently less horrific than greece , so i would n't say it 's that bad . 
   the unhcr regularly begs for money . 
  the eu member states are very good at ignoring that . 
   the eu states are the largest contributors to the unhcr . 
  it 's everybody else that 's very good at ignoring it . 
   there is absolutely no reason to keep them in greece . 
  there 's reason enough , for example not having them come here , and not having more and more coming . 
  no thank you very much , you can keep them . 
  and sweden 's fault . 
  i do n't think they understand turkish , try english . 
  if you want everybody unemployed and make a deal that in a couple of years people will start working again because you want to spend your savings , it could be . 
  generally it 's not considered healthy at all .
