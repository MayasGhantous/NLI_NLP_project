yeah i got ta give you this one , the common dutchie is `` gierig '' . 
  correction , indonesians do n't think so . 
  but tbh , i do n't really blame them , we did some really bad shit over there in the past . 
   for example , how many nazi collaborators were taken to trial and convicted in the netherlands ? 
  in other words , more than germany relatively . 
   i 'm sorry , but you 're dumber than a sack of rocks . 
  when has hitler believed that indians were part of the aryan race ? 
  [ guess you are the one being dumber than a sack of rocks , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_order_ ( nazism ) #hitler .27 s_plans_for_north_america ) but then again , comparing your with a sack of rocks would be insulting to the rocks . 
   again , you still got better than the others . 
  what the fuck . 
  you 're a fucking psychopath you know that . 
  how in the world can you say something like that . 
  `` you had it better ? '', 
  are you gon na say to the armenians too `` you had it better , the jews had 6 milllion '' . 
  are you gon na say to starving kids in africa `` you have it better '' . 
  are you gon na say to war refugees : `` you have it better '' . 
  you 're a sick fucking psychopath , that 's what you fucking are . 
   aww , not only you avoid responding , you still suggest that i 'm the one lacking knowledge !, 
  such clever retorts . 
  are n't you a smart cookie ? 
  i 'm telling you you 're lazy and you should find out for yourself why things were that way . 
  but hey , since you never go outside lazy is probably your middle name  i 'm not sure you 're trolling or if you do n't really understand the point . 
  le memes xdxdxd  and either you like it or not , that is problematic , especially because it 's been and still is , the generic dutch attitude about nazi collaborationist . 
   implying causation  implying attitudes wew lad you have to come with some really hard evidence here buddy to back up your claim . 
   it 's simply a reflection about historical facts . 
  and it reflected nothing . 
  again , causation / = correlation . 
  history if way more nuanced than you , and those historians try to portray it . 
  sure , there were relatively more collaborators , but after the war they were thrown out en mass , just as your source itself said . 
  war and opression makes good people do bad things . 
   why are you so defensive ? 
  \\  starts inciting hateful comments on out of context taken facts \\  people start refuting claims on lack of context \\  calls them defensive you know , this makes me curious . 
  where are your from ? 
   nationalism til defending history is being nationalistic . 
   and germans have no problems confronting their country 's past and the possible ramifications on their contemporary communal culture . 
  [ \\  mfw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strafgesetzbuch_section_86a ) . 
  you know that there is a huuuuuge taboo on talking about the nazis in germany ? 
   from my experience oh let me guess , you wanted a hooker to pop your cherry but she laughed at you when she saw your little pencil dick ? 
   the dutch struggle mightly to do [ wrong ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/satire#satire_in_nederland ) , [ wrong again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_kids ) , [ wrong yet again ] ( http://www.koefnoen.nl/ ) , and [ wrong again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kopspijkers ) and we could go on , and on , and on . 
   this is like a cartoon of an africa-american eating watermellon and skipping work to laze around and deal crack . 
  what mental holla hoops does one have to make to even consider them the same ? 
  i guess only an absolute retard would think of them alike , but then again , calling you a retard would be an insult to actual retards, 
   i never said `` you 're all nazis '' or anything close to it . 
  uhhhh wait a second  are you uncomfortable when people speak of countries that were never denazified oops  except for the fact i never made that error ( in other words , you 're blatantly lying and making up quotes ) and actually i have cited dutch historians . 
  oke then , what is your explanation for the high number of jews deported ? 
   hitler himself believed the dutch to be part of the aryan race ) so were the native indians  the netherlands got it much better than most occupied nations he starved our country to death you prick . 
   how 's that sentence even remotely related with the compliance and diligence of the dutch civil service in helping the deportation of jews to death camps ? 
  that is too complicated to answer in 1 post because there are a lot of reasons . 
  ) , simply because of orders , they did n't know what the big picture was and why they were deported etcetera . 
  if you want to learn more about it , read some history books . 
   how does it explain the thousands and thousands of dutch who rushed to join the ss ? 
  this was a europe wide phenomenon and widely researched . 
  look it up for yourself because again , there are too many reasons why someone would have done that . 
   how does it explain the dutch police doing everything to prevent jews from leaving the country even when it was clear germany was going to lose the war ? 
  because they are the police and it 's their job to keep citizens in their country if they want to flee and i 'm highly skeptical that they only stopped the jews from fleeing . 
   how does it explain that it took 40 years to apologize to the jews ? 
  beats me , and to be honest i do n't really care . 
  we have always paid tribute to the survivors and the ones who were lost and we will continue to do so for lon years to come . 
  what our grandparents did is not our guilt , for the same reason we do n't blame the germans today for their past . 
   how does it explain the resistance was basically non-existent compared with other similarly sized countries ? 
  this is well documented and researched , google it if you are truly curious . 
   how does it explain that a much higher percentage of the jewish population was killed ? 
  a whole lot of factors combined . 
  some on us , some on the germans . 
  again , this is widely researched . 
  look it up for yourself . 
  so again , nobody here thinks we were heroes . 
  so what 's your point ? 
  why so mad against us ? 
  did we hurt your feelings ? 
  what 's up with your grudge against us ? . 
   but perhaps it 's easier to pretend my comment was about how the dutch did n't emulate the brits and kept the fight against germany ? 
  \\  implying implications wew lad  the fact that so many dutch even these days are so defensive about it and prefer to ignore them - as you show - is very troubling . 
  i do n't ignore them , i just fail to see the relevance of it . 
  do you still go to the germans to hammer them with their past ? 
  no you do n't , because what 's the point ? 
   i do n't see any innocent banter . 
  i see some ugly xenophobic stereotyping oh now i see , this explains everything . 
  someone removed your humor bone and now you lost all ability to understand humor . 
  do you even have friends ? 
  must be fun to have you around ...  imagine a similar stuff made by a british tv channel about the greek working class for example , going through all the negative stereotypes . 
  again you must be a real blast . 
  and to tip it off , it goes completely over your head that the british political system is filled with ridicule and banter and that the humor of the british is notorious for these kind of jokes too . 
   i do n't see why this is different . 
  i thought we went through this , it 's your lack nof social skills and failing to understand humor  if you believe otherwise , then you have a problem , even if you are n't conscious about it . 
  ah the `` if you believe this you are literally [ insert insult here ] '' tactic . 
  a bold , desperate move , a last attempt of the basement dweller , but it did n't work out , just like the basement dweller himself . 
  / r9k / is [ that way ] ( https://boards.4chan.org/r9k ), 
  nah , most people here are born with randstad syndrome . 
  you do n't notice it most of the time but sometimes it gets really bad . 
  they start listening to slager music or they start drinking heineken . 
  it 's really sad tbh . 
  i kinda feel sorry for them . 
  this whole comment can be disputed with 1 sentence : * we are one of the smallest countries with one of the least inhabitants , especially during ww2 . 
  what the fuck do you expect , that we could hold out 5 years against nazi germany ? 
  that we could magicaly summon an verzetsleger of 1 million people out of thin air ? 
  no one here thinks we were heroes during ww2 , except for a few verzetstrijders . 
  i do n't get it , you see some innocent banter towards our neighbours oversea , and you somehow are so butthurt that you bring up the fucking holocaust . 
  seriously , the fuck are you thinking ? 
  sounds like a day in the netherlands to me .
