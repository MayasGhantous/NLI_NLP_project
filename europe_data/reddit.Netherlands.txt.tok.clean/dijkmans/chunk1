sounds like china , are you sure we 're talking about the same place ? 
  wait does belarus have a stereotype ? 
  you only annoyance is the huge amount of students due to the university ,, 
  it teaches about more than what stands in the bible . 
  you learn more about the other major religions and cultures in the world . 
  for exactly this reason you should keep some kind of religious class to avoid misbelieves like that qu ` ran calls for jihad . 
  furthermore it is also true that on some religious schools some untruths are thought like the story about how god created the world in 7 days . 
  yes we have a shortage of bullets , helmets and spare parts for vehicles , like f16 or armored cars, 
  well at least they have to fund the army with propper equipment . 
  ^ ^ not ^ ^ with ^ ^ a ^ ^ helmet ^ ^ shortage ^ ^ of ^ ^ all ^ ^ things, 
  this is the reason why we win the speed skating medals at the olympics !, 
  wait is n't cheating on a exam illegal ? 
   the recent moves made by the german military with the move to merge some aspects with the dutch military is a good start , but far from enough . 
  great !!, 
  dutch troops with german funding . 
  ^ ^ we ^ ^ totally ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ have ^ ^ a ^ ^ funding ^ ^ problem ^ ^ which ^ ^ causses ^ ^ a ^ ^ shortage ^ ^ of ^ ^ everything, 
  you need to think how much engineering went into getting holland dry . 
  in the province of groningen ( nl ) is nearly every week an earthquake with a size of 2.5 to 3.5 on the richter scale . 
  this is because of gas mines . 
  officially flemish is dutch only with accent, 
  finland why ? 
  always one or two places above us ( nl ) ? 
  well the germans in the netherlands at the end war used dutch defencive doctrine ( put the land under water ^ ^ ** best ** ^ ^ defencive ^ ^ policy ^ ^ since ^ ^ 1584 ) . 
  this made that the netherlands was harder to liberate than the conquest of germany . 
  you forget the attacks on charlie hebdo, 
  do n't ask the dutch . 
  we eat a lot of it . 
  a eu army that stands apart from the armies of memberstates is actually bad . 
  this is because you now have to compede wih the limited manpower pool of some nations . 
  here in the netherlands we have a shortage of technical people in the army and its not good if they can choose between two armies which makes the shortage even bigger . 
  and broke without the subsidies of given by western europe, 
   finland 1.71  netherlands 1.71 why is finland always just one place above us ? 
   and guess what : if the army want to do `` adverts '' e.g. 
  at schools here in the netherlands we have now for years adverts on the television for the search of technical militairy personal . 
  the adverts go even so far that at the university i study at they have posters for the search . 
  united states of europe . 
  well the short version of this word is even already a word !!, 
  i 'm sorry to tell you but the ecb only prints euros no pounds . 
  the brittish central bank has to intevene, 
  immigrants from the peoples republic of china are n't immigrants for you china . 
  you claim theim to be your citizens . 
  * the * netherlands of course, 
   must be because we are the world 's number 2 gross exporter of food this is by value not by quantity . 
  the netherlands exports a lot of peppers and tomatos ( westland ) which have a high price per kilo compared to grain or rice ( a bit more important food ) . 
  no but if we are united the eu could start behaving more like the us . 
  ( very agressive ), 
  what are you going to do with one of those royal families . 
  mary theim of ? 
   what , you think it 's better when europe stays fragmented and weak ? 
  the eu fall in between these right . 
   united we have a lot of influence worldwide and can use it to pursue our interests . 
  fragmented , we will become unimportant in a world with the us , china and india , who oftentimes act against our interests . 
  europe is the biggest market where products are sold . 
  the combined gdp of the eu is bigger than any other country on the planet . 
  this gives the eu a big negociation power . 
  furhthermore we have 4 of the strongest militairy industrial complexes in the world ( italy , germany , france and uk ) . 
  this insures that we should be taken seriously . 
  the eu also has the third biggest manpower pool so if we would be confronted by a foreign thread the eu can defend it self . 
  a devided europe makes the world a bit safer because we do n't have the capability of declaring a war as the aggressor as the eu . 
  dont forget he is still having the `` does climatechange exist '' debate . 
  dont say that to an american . 
  they have 27 amendments but eleven are from the 18th century , and after that they got one on average every twelf years . 
  hey if you were on it it would be a good list . 
  italy was a part of the central powers but they did n't join the german side because they saw it as ah attacking . 
  later in summer of 1915 italy joined ww1 on the french/brittish side because they wanted ah land ( south tirol , trieste , dalmatia ) . 
  well yes , but we have the 27th of april and the 5th of may, 
   may the fourth do n't think thats a great idea since in the netherlands we remember those whom have fallen for our country . 
  it 's also the day that germany attacked the netherlands in world war 2 . 
  do n't think it is a good idea to celebrate european unity at such an date . 
  unless it is always in the weekend most companies and some schools will be against it ( from dutch perspective ) . 
  for example we already have 27th of april , 5th of may , good friday , second day of easter , ' [ hemelvaarstdag ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/hemelvaartsdag ) ( some even give the friday after this off too ) ' , ' [ tweede pinksterdag ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/pinksteren ) ' , and lastly first and second day of christmas . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.mkbservicedesk.nl/1055/wanneer-ben-wettelijk-verplicht.htm ) * if its between ' ' i do n't know the name for it in english * as you can see we already have a lot of free days or the employer has to pay the salary that is usual for a sunday . 
  furthermore i do n't think any of us want to give one up so we can have one for europe . 
   belgium , andora , bulgaria and georgia , get the badge of shame for not even trying . 
  belgium and bulgaria are using a translation of the national motto of the dutch republic ( 1588-1795 ) : `` eendracht maakt macht '' . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unity_makes_strength ), 
   english is n't really a threat to the supremacy of dutch in the netherlands though . 
  foreigners are still forced to learn dutch by society if they want to participate and are required to learn dutch by the government if they want to become dutch citizens . 
  you do n't need to learn dutch if you are from the eu , eea , turkey or switzerland . 
  you also do n't need to learn it if you are an expat . 
  most expats live in the big cities so that makes it look like that the cities become more anglophone . 
  do you know why spain is a permanent guest ? 
  eu migration from east to west , from south to north is the biggest ( or second biggest after climate change ) challenge for the eu over the long term . 
  last year ( 2016 ) 229.563 people migrated 1 to the netherlands .

  why is the netherlands coloured pink ? 
  you know we split from you in 1581 ( before it was just a rebellion ) and got official recognition from spain in 1648, 
  and still the government needs to pay for the fyra debacle . 
  probably chosing the netherlands if you have to chose a country when there is a dispute / conflict between the netherlands and your former home country, 
   there has n't been any major war between nation states since ww2 . 
  there were more institutions for preventing war between european nations . 
  like the [ concert of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concert_of_europe ), 
  could people just stop calling him `` dutch '' / `` diversity party '' / turkish . 
  i am totally against what he is standing for but i get why `` dutch '' turks people voted for him , if there is a negative bias towards turks . 
  if he really really represents those people than sure let him alone and give him a chance . 
  but put real critism or you 're just as bad as wilders . 
  let theim come . 
  it 's only 180.000 a year . 
  literally 1/5 of what germany got in 2015 . 
  we just need to spread it over the countries equally .
