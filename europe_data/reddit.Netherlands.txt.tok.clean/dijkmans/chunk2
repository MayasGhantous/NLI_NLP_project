  # noooooooo !!!!, 
  not again !!, 
  netherlands will win of you all !!, 
  1672 never forget !, 
  i find it interesting that most of the votes of cu/sgp were from women , while they are against abortions . 
  aruba , sint maarten and curacao are autonomous countries within the kingdom . 
  they have a parlement of their own . 
  bonaire , saba and sint eustatius are part of the netherlands propper since october 2010 . 
  they will vote in these elections . 
  however they are really disappointed in the little change that happend since 2010 . 
  the real poverty in the netherlands is right there and has probably not changed for the better since 2010 . 
  you know you get money from un if you send troops to in their name , under their command . 
  people do n't like seeing people earning more than they do , but the things is that income inequality is needed . 
  if you have done a very expensive study but they pay is no better than the pay of a garbage collector why did you do that study ? 
  ^ ^ except ^ ^ liking ^ ^ the ^ ^ job futhermore there is technology that is adapted early on by the richest . 
  for example nokia made smartphone from the 90s onwards . 
  these were very expensive to produce because nobody wanted one yet ( small consumerbase ) , but the rich bought these things because internet / better keyboard . 
  without the rich a lot of companies and products would not have succeeded . 
  the thing that needs to be improved is equal pay for equal work with equal qualifications . 
  no matter the race , gender , sexual orientation and believes . 
   like seriously , what 's up with far right leaders loving orange fake tan and bleached hair so much ? 
  wilders got his tan from his mothers side of the family who was born in the dutch east-indies . 
  you also miss luxembourg . 
  it 's coloured yellow, 
  [ here ] ( https://ind.nl/paginas/landenlijst-behoud-nationaliteit.aspx ) is a list with every country the netherlands reconizes about double nationalitiies . 
  they could nationalize all dutch investments but that would be a act of war ( or at least starting it ) . 
  if you want to contain russia you need someone to control where it 's fleet is . 
  they have one warm-water ( not freezing over in winter ) port in crimea and so on the black sea . 
  all sea traffic for the russian fleet there is able to be monitered because turkey is a nato member and are in control over the bosporus . 
  the netherlands on the other hand is a bigger burden on nato than turkey . 
  we have a badly equiped army , a small navy and a small air force . 
  we are no where close to russia and we need nato protection more than nato needs us . 
  it is still a big thing in the netherlands because all news and sports are still getting reported on there, 
  if they actually enforce economic sanctions on the netherlands than they will get a ** european ** response . 
  futhermore the netherlands is the biggest trading partner , one of the biggest investment partners , has a bigger economy than turkey and has extremely close ties with all of the eu . 
  futhermore they violated international laws while claiming we have . 
  i do n't see erdogan having a slightest chance of winning this dispute . 
  he will only get some short term support but on the long term turkey will lose . 
  that is not the reason turkey is one of the most valuable members of nato . 
  it is because of its location . 
  the bosporus and the dardanelles are the straits that connect the mediterranean sea with the black sea . 
  in the black sea is the only european warm-water naval base of russia . 
  it is here ( crimea ) where a big part of the russia fleet is docked . 
  turkey helps to contain russia by monitoring these straits . 
   just to prevent those single person splinter parties . 
  the splinter parties that should be banned are those of the mps that have split of from a party in parlement but have kept their seat . 
  this should change to only being able to keep their seat if they got enough votes personally . 
  the sad part of this is that the militairy needs a budget of 1.3 billion euro more to even fully pay all its duties . 
   it 's possible cause the home ownership rate is lower in germany or the netherlands while it 's higher in italy or france . 
  at least that 's what i think . 
  do n't know about italy or france , but in the netherlands we all have a high morgage and do n't pay off because the interest is a deductable when doing taxes . 
  these big morgages probably do n't help in this chart . 
  we should only build this doggerland of your if it could be around 20.000 km2 . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ netherlands ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ only ^ ^ ^ ^ 40.000 ^ ^ ^ ^ km2 . 
  when that is build it is the biggest artifical island in the world around 20x the size of the current biggest ( flevopolder , nl ) and around 800x the current second biggest artificial island ( [ yas island , abu dhabi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yas_island ) ) . 
  thanks !, 
  did n't know that this was this weekend . 
  there was only speed skating on tv ( world championship allround , men : all three medals , women : gold ) . 
  the netherlands probably would be dark green today . 
  last year the netherlands gained around 110.000 people . 
  nearly all was migration and of this only 25.000 people were asylum seekers . 
  so probaly the rest is mostly from europe . 
  i was reacting on this sentence of him :  i hate it when benelux , nordics and gro\u00dfdeutschl\u00e4nder act like the apocalypse would be near while 95 % of the world population is jealous of our standard of living . 
  yet there are a lot of problems here . 
  a big part of 20 to 30 year olds have a flex contract , house prises in some municipallity in the randstad are 9x average year salary , a lot of children would n't have enough food without foodbanks , people having no salary increase for over a decade . 
  i could go on for a long time . 
  yes it is not a apokalypse but we still have a lot of problems that even third world countries have . 
  edit : ( was reaction on this )  i hate it when benelux , nordics and gro\u00dfdeutschl\u00e4nder act like the apocalypse would be near while 95 % of the world population is jealous of our standard of living . 
  i like the arrow but to what is it pointing ? 
  why do you count the french annexation of the kingdom of holland in 1810 as seperated ? 
  between 1810 and 1815 the netherlands and belgium and luxembourg were part of france, 
  in the map of the netherlands there is also a error . 
  ` het rijksmuseum ' is not located in the south of leiden but in the south of amsterdam . 
  [ how the roads in belgium are made . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wecbhcxlhqm ), 
  do you really think that a eu army would have fewer different weapon types ? 
  i would think that in the eu parlement there will be a lot of lobbying ( like in the us ) to keep the factories open . 
  there would also be a lot of lobbying done by germany , france and italy ( the countries with the biggest weapon manufacturing in the euro-area ) . 
  i think it could reduce the amount of weapon types but not by a lot . 
  furthermore this could also be achieved by closer cooperation between the armies . 
  according to wikipedia the construction was stopped in 2013 due to budget reasons, 
  well actually the port of delfzijl ( not that big but google is there ) is on this estuary . 
  we just want that ships have can pass through dutch waters . 
  [ gib sea . 
  somewhat true , but the thing still is that the netherlands exports/imports around half a trillion euro of stuff so the +60 billion is still impressive . 
  for example the netherlands imports a lot of crude oil and that gets refined in the refineries of rotterdam . 
  the petrol and gas that is exported have a higher value per liter than crude oil . 
  because of this the netherlands imports as much of a value of oil products as it exports . 
  there are much more examples like agracultural equipment which buys parts from all over europe but installs it here and then exports it to all over the world . 
  yeah look at the map of [ europe with forests ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5q39yw/forest_map_of_europe_proportion_of_forest_from/ ), 
   ` sinterklaas ' ** triggered **, 
  by the people that see zwarte piet as racist sinterklaas is seen as a slave master . 
   fact # 5 this map does not include nuclear reactors used for science and education nor for the production of supliments of medicine . 
  if that was also included the netherlands would have 3 in total . 
  one 2 mw reactor for science in the south of the city of delft and the reactor of petten for medicine . 
  that means belgian anschluss . 
   and maybe he wants the immigrants who do not want to live under dutch society rules to be sent back . 
  i honestly think this should be done more often but not only with african/muslim immigrants . 
  i actually hate it when brittish/american/english speaking expats come to live in the netherlands and do n't learn/use the language .
