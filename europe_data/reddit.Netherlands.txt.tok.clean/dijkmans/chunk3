  well actually the area depicted here is the area of the franks ( you know those guys who now live in france ), 
  i always thought that you wrote italian with an capital . 
  hey guys there is one problem with this graph . 
  if this graph is correct than the eu gets around ** 103.24 billion euro as a contribution ** , but they ** spend 117.46 billion euro . 
  ** so there is a budget deficit of 14.22 billion euro . 
   they 're probably aware of it , but the lengthy goodbyes where everyone says bye to everyone else including some number of predetermined kisses while the foreigner has no clue what 's going on  he has not been to a dutch birthday party yet ... 
   i wish we had mountains , so i could go skiing in the weekends !, 
  well flevoland wanted one . 
  it was so famous that even the donald duck had a story here about it . 
  it did n't affect our economy much but this is purchasing power . 
  how much can you buy with this euro ? 
   wait , the fuck netherlands ? 
  on the first of october 2012 the vat in the netherlands went from 19 % to 21 % . 
  furthermore there also was a excise tax increase on the first of january 2013 . 
  should the euro fail there will be a common currency between the stronger northern european countries . 
  for the nl it would have been worse if the war dragged on for another month . 
  no railway movement for civilians or goods made it that there was a huge food shortage in since market garden until the end . 
  where else do you put your solar panels ? 
  every european country has committed a amount of money to the eu every year . 
  this amount is set every five years and the next time it will be discussed is in 2021 . 
  it will be a breaking point of the ` brexit negosiations ' . 
   the british , the danes , the norwegians , the swiss , the swedes , the portuguese and the finns i thought the dutch were also very anti federation / pro-trade area, 
  smart, 
   i do n't see the problem that baltic sea is a perfect runway . 
  who cares about denmark anyway ? 
  that location is already reserved for doggerland . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ stupid ^ ^ ^ ^ brits ^ ^ ^ ^ stealing ** ^ ^ ^ ^ our ** ^ ^ ^ ^ sea ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ windmills, 
  i suddenly know why finland is falling in the education lists . 
  colonies are not protected by nato and they are n't fully part of the eu like say guadeloupe is . 
  they do , but almost everyone uses amsterdam schiphol airport . 
  found it !, 
  they took the conurbanization [ ` haaglanden ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haaglanden ) and [ ` rijnmond ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rijnmond ) . 
  but i would still argue that the larger rotterdam-the hague metropolitan area should be taken because they did n't take the conurbanization of [ ` amsterdam ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/city_region_of_amsterdam ) . 
  labour cost probably , for example we have a lot of eastern europeans working on the farms/greenhouses . 
  also last week i learned that there is a difference between nl and be in aspect of breaks at work . 
  in the nl you do n't get paid when having a break and in be you do get paid . 
  you take the cities of haarlem , almere and hilversum into the amsterdam but you dont consider the [ rotterdam-the hague metropolitan area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotterdam_the_hague_metropolitan_area ) . 
  according to this wiki they have a population and economy about the size of the amsterdam one . 
  this is probably total food waste in a country devided by the total population of that country . 
  this makes the netherlands look bad because we export a lot of food . 
  this skews it quit a lot since the farming industry is as big of a source of food waste as the consumer . 
  futhermore the figure i was able to find says that the average dutch citizen wastes about [ 100 to 150 kilo per year ] ( http://www.wur.nl/upload_mm/6/2/c/e56f6a8c-8d71-4fca-ab2f-17cafe6b92b9_rapport-monitor-voedselverspilling-update-2009-2014.pdf ) . 
  of this about [ 50 kilo ] ( http://www.nowastenetwork.nl/wp-content/uploads/factsheet-voedselverspilling-huishoudens-december2013.pdf ) is wasted directly by the consumer . 
  venezuela has a comparible fleet in numbers but is less advanced . 
  but if they are capable of taking the islands or destroying the airfields we will probably not be able to get these islands back . 
  we have anti air capability on the fleet but the fleet isnt big enough to protect the transportships from a big air assult . 
  according to [ global firepower index ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ) uk ( 6 ) vs argentina ( 35 ) and nl ( 39 ) vs venezuela ( 45 ), 
  [ aruba , cura\u00e7ao and bonaire ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/aruba/@12.0573378,-69.4437259,9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8e8538cfe25a77db:0xf16a8a3e89818c2f!8m2!3d12.52111!4d-69.968338 ) are a few islands off the coast of venezuela and they make every few years a claim to the islands . 
  1667 is better, 
  they probably think about wars against terror instead of againt a nearby country . 
  the only country that is a bit of a threat is venezuela and thats on the other side of the globe . 
  the netherlands procudes a lot of food . 
  and because we are cheap we only buy the food in sales . 
  in the summer there is the big harvest where we have a discount of sometimes -30 % at lidl when comparing to the winter . 
  but also in winter we have kale and asperges which were just harvested . 
  was one of the forts of the hollandic waterline . 
  stopped being it after 1926 . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  how else do we get our germanic efficiency ? 
  i like that there is a windmill inside the fort . 
  ** cough ** ^ ^ mountain ** cough **, 
  distract us from real internal problems . 
  politicians do this all the time . 
  the real reason why we are in the top of those `` we and finland vs the world '' lists . 
  honestly , i compare it to the netherlands . 
  we ( the netherlands ) pay a lot to the eu and do n't get much back in form of subsisdies . 
  this is not bad because we have now more opportunities to trade with europe . 
  it 's just the tax we need to pay to trade europe . 
  but i also want that this taxmoney is spend in a way that it is not a waste of money . 
  we only hear bad stories like that poland builds a soundwall next to farmland with this eu money . 
  i see this as a way that could be a result of corruption in the eu . 
  if you like the dutch east india company you could try the childrens movie ` de scheepjongens van de bontekoe ' , but it 's spoken in dutch . 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ has ^ ^ not ^ ^ as ^ ^ high ^ ^ quality ^ ^ as ^ ^ a ^ ^ hollywood ^ ^ movie . 
  it 's about three boys who go with the voc to the east indies . 
  if you like dutch history you could also try ` michiel de ruyter ' , also mostly spoken in dutch . 
  ^ ^ same ^ ^ as ^ ^ the ^ ^ other ^ ^ one . 
  it 's about the famous dutch admiral and the dutch republic in 1660-1670 . 
  come back when the eu ( as institution is also included ) . 
  they would be at the bottom . 
  for those whom do n't know and will be asking about the netherlands : in the netherlands the house prices dropped like a rock between 2008 and 2014 . 
  this can explain the big drop in weath in the netherlands . 
  furthermore it could be because we had an increase in vat ( from 19 to 21 % ) . 
  and i thought that nuclear deterrence was mad !, 
   so how do you secure the sea ? 
  you drain it and place a fence !, 
   millions of economic immigrants from eastern europe moved to western europe . 
  true but have you considered that this is also bad . 
  the we accept only the economic migrants which have the possibility to actually compete in the labour market . 
  aka we accept only those who have a education ( we do n't want to pay theim unemploymentsubsidies if they are always jobless ) . 
  this also applies to the migrants from eastern europe . 
  by accepting only the educated you make the future of these countries even worse by accepting their doctors and teachers of the future to work in our countries . 
  i think that the netherlands can have a bigger army/navy/airforce but i do n't see the netherlands getting any where near the 2 % in the next ten years . 
  the last time we were above the 2 % of gdp was when we still had conscription ( 1994 ) . 
  furthermore we do n't develop a lot of weapons and that 's also a way to make it look bigger than it actually is . 
  do n't forget that poland/eastern europe has it easier than western europe , because nearly all of theim go to the west ( because money ) . 
  here in the netherlands we already have a very badly integrated group of migrants which already creates some tensions between the people . 
  this is why we had big populist parties for more than a decate ( like the pvv or lijst van fortuin ) . 
  furthermore you can say this but poland did not even accept as many refugees from syria during the migrant crisis as like belgium or the netherlands . 
  these people are not refugees . 
  they do not flee from wars or oppression .
