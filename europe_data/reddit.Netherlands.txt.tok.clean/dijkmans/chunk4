  they flee from poverty . 
  the last paragraph of the article says : ( sorry for some bad translations , used google translate )  the commission and tusk insist further on better monitoring of the southern ( land ) border with libya , because the immigrants come in . 
  agreements are also needed with the countries of origin ( nigeria , eritrea , gambia , ivory coast ) to stop their people and ( once intercepted ) take back . 
  juncker and tusk find that all pressure means thereby be permitted , including threatened with the withdrawal of trade benefits and development . 
   finally , the commission wants to breathe the africa fund , a new financial life . 
  african leaders promised to end of 2015 as investment for their countries , the enthusiasm among european leaders to fill the hitherto modest 80 million from the member states by 1.8 billion from the eu budget . 
  ** while the fund is designed to the root cause of migration - poverty , unemployment - to take away . 
  ** additional clamping , because those who arrive in italy almost invariably comes to economic migrants . 
   next week will show whether the leaders now are willing to make available additional funds . 
  the commission deleted the safe side at the last moment , all references to funding proposals from 2018 . 
   second largest exporter of food by value , not by quantity . 
  we produce a lot of peppers and seeds which are more valueable than grain . 
  to get onto the voting list you need to pay $ 10.000 , - . 
  this was introducted in the '30s because we got too many political party ( 53 at that time ) .

  do n't forget that if you get a benelux or a nordic nation ( united ) that they would disrupt the balance of power in europe and the eu . 
  currently germany and france are the defining powers in the eu , but if you get benelux together they would be considered a force and you actually need to listen to them . 
  so i do n't think it 's that clear except for some small countries like the baltic . 
  in the netherlands we are a bit skewed with the port of rotterdam , but probably half of the import and export is with the netherlands proper . 
  that 's when you count oil/gasoline as reexport , altough we refine it . 
  for example according to the cia world factbook the netherlands exported around [ 460 billion dollars ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2078rank.html ) worth of goods to other countries . 
  [ according to the cbs the netherlands exported last year around 85 billion dollars worth of agracultural goods . 
  ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2017/03/agricultural-exports-up-by-over-4-percent ) that 's already around 20 % of exports . 
   the deficit is our issue and could be a better indicator . 
  and the 3 % rule is stupid because if you want to invest ( and in return earn more ) you can not . 
  so it is a good indicator over time . 
  the goal is a balanced budget . 
  the 3 % rule is for times you need to invest . 
  like times of crisis, 
   active military personnel russia does have conscription while poland the uk and france do not . 
  conscripts do ** not ** fight as well as a professionel army . 
   tanks russia has a lot of very outdated tanks that are n't a match for the french or brittish modern tanks . 
  at least in the netherlands all militairy planes are bought with the caribean in mind . 
  so all militairy planes need the capability to fly there in one go . 
  ^ ^ we ^ ^ have ^ ^ some ^ ^ islands ^ ^ there . 
   the failure of the french and uk air forces to mount a bombing campaign over libya without us direct support showed that there is a capability gap . 
  it 's more of a stockpile shortage or the lack of will to keep a huge stockpile than a lack of political will to purchase bombs . 
  the netherlands had the same issue with the bombs in the fight against isis . 
  it needed to stop the bombing of isis in july ( after a half year of bombing ) last year because the bombs had run out . 
   do you feel that europe could defend itself ( or could the netherlands defend itself ) without the us ? 
  the netherlands is actually a hard to invade country . 
  it is very urbanized and if we have the time to flud some polders than it can only be invaded by a large force of infantry . 
  [ tanks are no match in a fludded polder . 
  too heavy . 
  ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/10-mei-1940-het-enige-tankje-bleef-in-de-kazerne~a1001036/#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=281cf425-81df-400f-aed9-2127c8ba507c ) we have a decent airforce and a reletively strong navy ( no match for a carier though ) . 
  so yeah i think we can defend ourselfs against a equally strong ( in army personel ) army , and against a larger force we can surely defend for a long time . 
  europe is a different story , you see a the militairy spending shortage all across europe . 
  germany , the netherlands and others have trouble maintaining their hardware at a always fighting ready level . 
  here we have a bullet shortage for about 4 years now . 
  this is because eu regulations on the budget of a country ( aka do n't spend too much ) . 
  at least our government has increased the budget for defence by 250 million this year to address these shortages . 
  but we will not get any where near the target ( 2 % of gdp ) the donald wants in the coming 10 years . 
  just because that would mean literally dubbeling the budget and we have nowhere to get this from and would probably mean increasing militairy personel to around ~ 90.000 ( +50 % ) . 
  militairy personel is hard to find because we usually do n't see a threat around us . 
   so , how do you feel about the us buying influence in europe by funding defense ? 
  europe pays its defence by itself . 
  the extra protection for eastern europe is nice so we do n't need conscription . 
   would you prefer no us influence , but paying for your own defense ? 
  ** we pay our own defence ** . 
  given it could be better , but the us influence is there because we ( netherlands ) buy american weapons . 
  what your defence budget is spend on is developing weapons ( most nations do n't develop but buy for others ) and fighting wars . 
  it is not funding any european army directly . 
   brussels . 
  per capita gdp is 2x flanders and 3x wallonia . 
  both sides want it . 
  who gets it ? 
  the netherlands obviously . 
   how do we draw the border ? 
  [ like this ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/heelnederlandineuropa.png ) ^ ^ ps : ^ ^ the ^ ^ orange ^ ^ countries ^ ^ are ^ ^ our ^ ^ colonies  how do we break the news to the eu ? 
  they will find out in time . 
  well , he 's dutch with the right voc mentality . 
  dutch disease is a economic condition when too much foreign money enters the economy . 
  in short when too much foreign money enters the economy the value of your currency goes up ( because you can only buy things in your currency in your country ) . 
  this can be counterproductive because your country can become less competive compared to the other nations ( because higher wages when expressed in foreign currency ) . 
  when this happens the unemployment figures will go up and you actually can get into a crisis . 
  it 's called dutch disease because the finding of the gas bubble in groningen and the rise of unemployment right after that . 
  ... paid by brussels, 
  actually this compares the car sales of 2016 compared to 2015 . 
  in december 2015 a subsidy on hybride cars was abolished . 
  because of this the car sales went through the roof here . 
  that explains the decrease of sales . 
  ( it was so bad that some car manufacturers needed to move some hybrides from italy to holland to meet demand here . ), 
  do n't forget that ** italy france germany and the uk ** also need to invest in making new weapon systems . 
  this cost more than importing it from other countries . 
  this is more worrying than the low expandature of other countries . 
  if these countries dont invest in their future militairy tech than nato can not be assured of having better tech than russia . 
  within the eu is a free market . 
  importing from outside the eu is where the free market ends . 
  when you try to protect the home market with import tarrifs you end the free market . 
  this is to protect the home market and give the home market a advantage . 
  the government does this to prevent having a lot of unemployed people at the cost of profits of some companies . 
  this is what for example the donald wants to impose in the us . 
  one army does n't make europe stronger . 
  the fact that we develop 4 different types of every weapon system is inefficient . 
  france asked the un and its allies for help with the mission in mali . 
  probably less , but if you give theim any reason to attack [ ( ... like arresting a diplomat ) ] ( http://www.ad.nl/buitenland/bijna-oorlog-met-venezuela-na-neerstorten-mh17~aee2027e/ ) they might do it . 
  i meant a video more like his falklands war version 2016 video . 
  furthermore nl is more likely to fight venezuela on it 's own due to it being sort of colonies ( and nato does n't protect colonies ) . 
  honestly i would rather see a comparison between the netherlands and venezuela than between nl and belgium .
