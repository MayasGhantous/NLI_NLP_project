  it 's similar to the netherlands , but just more so : same emphasis on getting drunk , but taking it just a step further . 
  combined with the tendency never to wear a coat up north , and for the girls to wear high heels they ca n't walk on it does n't always paint a nice picture . . on the other hand , there 's much more of an interest in beer here as well . 
  try finding a pub in the netherlands that sells different craft beers every week . 
  here , they are everywhere and people ( usually a bit older than students ) enjoy their beer , as opposed to just ordering whatever is the one beer on tap as in the netherlands . 
  haha i love that that guy got an armoured vehicle for opposing islamification , and his first item of business is to hand in a ( strongly worded ? ), 
  letter . 
  it 's hardly occultist to notice a similarity in a slogan like that . 
  it was the first connection i made as well to be honest , though i see no reason why it should fall under a censorship law . 
  if the only similar slogan you know is that one , the connection is easily made . 
  does n't have to imply anything either way , neither that it really does have nazi connotations ( clearly it does n't ) nor that the person making the connection is overly sensitive or as you say occultist . 
  i read that in the voice of sir humphrey appleby ( yes minister ) , 
  impressive , but all i can think is `` brutalism !, 
  because fuck sunlight ! '', 
  could you elaborate on that ? 
  i 'm not sure what events inevitably led to putin intervening miliatarily . . 
  would n't make much of a difference . 
  it 's not like the dutch government is proposing anything more than appeasement . 
  ck2 i suppose ? 
  then you should know he will need rome to restore the pentarchy . . 
  and we 're definitely still dredging the canals and rivers . 
  sounds like a-grade bullshit to me . 
  awww yisssss * celebratory dance time, 
  while it was brutal and fostered hate in some regions , it ca n't be denied that in other regions it was very effective . . 
  hmm good one . . the same thing happens with other romance languages , so perhaps it 's due to a different consonant shift that happened earlier ? 
  i 'm not really sure , i just like looking these things up on wikipedia . 
  * actually , browsing a bit more , it could have been part of the changes in early-proto-germanic , part of grimm 's law ( the consonant shift that also led from pater to father ) . 
  i do n't see how this shift would apply to the name of a group of tribes that would n't appear for a long time though , 
  the alemannii were a sizable faction within the frankish kingdom though i believe . 
  one of the bigger enemies of the franks at first as well , which is probably why they had a more lasting impression on the franks . 
  are you talking about the high german consonant shift ? 
  it 's the only one i could find that looks similar ... 
  in that case it ca n't be , as low german , dutch and english did n't participate in this shift , so you 'd expect to see france being called prance in english ( and prankrijk in dutch ) . 
  i do n't like the title of this article at all . 
  the article presents no evidence of manipulation of statistics , it presents evidence of straight up lying . 
  so call it that . 
  the daily mail lied ( yet again ) . 
  because they 've probably taken [ these ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_france#statistics ) statistics from 1999 as their source . 
  the two metrics they look at have arabic at either # 3 or # 5 , and german on either # 2 or # 3, 
  meh , the uk is a pretty big country in the eu , and uses the language that most people here understand . 
  a bit of bias is to be expected , and if we view the countries a series of posts is about as a stochastic process , some clustering of subject countries in time is to be expected as well . . 
  just because it is n't considered racist does n't mean it is n't ... 
  woosh ... on a more serious note , at the very least we should aspire not to tolerate racism . 
  i agree , gordon 's reaction is ridiculous . 
  ` you should n't make a big deal about me saying something incredibly offensive ' . 
  the not-pology of rtl just pours salt in the wound . 
  i do n't know much about russia , i was talking about the focus on europe needing population growth ( according to the author ) . 
  us states are comparable in size to european countries . 
  i really do n't think it 's that much of a stretch, 
  sadly , i would probably not do better than any of them filling in this map , but i definitely would be much worse naming the states . 
  very good efforts here , 
  yes !, 
  let 's focus only on the immediate economic impact of a particular trend in population size . 
  there 's no need to consider any possible downsides to striving for a consistent year-on-year increase of a few percent , certainly no country would consider population increase a problem and try to do something silly like a one-child policy . 
  going by the trend in this ... what is wrong with dutch non-cheese dairy ? 
  or ukrainian bread ? 
  or the vatican 's army ? 
  ok , i guess i know the last one . . 
  woosh, 
  i 'd like to see proficiency tests in english for british people as a baseline , though , 
  tax laws from the eastern roman empire . 
  seriously though , byzantine just means complex in this context . 
  yeah it 's sampling bias , pure and simple . 
  the number of pro-europeans amongst people interested in reading about europe is likely to be higher than among the general population . 
  i would like the eu to have a bit more weight , but i have to admit that in this case the bad influence is coming simply because the eu is becoming more powerful and relevant -- and therefore a more interesting lobbying target . 
  federalisation would probably cause more of the same, 
  seems like we have the biggest e-peen here , 
  while i 'm sure that there are people in the us who will get angry if you do n't speak ` american ' , it can not be denied that the us has one of the best track records when it comes to assimilating immigrants . 
  and us culture is definitely about everywhere . 
  do n't know why you 're getting downvotes . . 
  yeah , i 'm in the uk , in a city with many chinese students . 
  the chinese food here is miles ahead of the netherlands . 
  if you know the right places , you can get great dim sum , authentic cantonese and szechuan food . 
  only problem is they expect you to speak a chinese language at some places . 
  yeah , just to add to the chorus : holland does n't make me feel patriotic at all . 
  it makes me think of all the kitschy stuff that became popular at the same time as ` ik hou van holland ' . 
  it 's fun , but does n't inspire patriotism . 
  i know when holland is used as pars-pro-toto , but i still do n't think it 's quite right . 
  disclaimer : i 'm not a doctor or medical researcher , do n't take what i say too seriously . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  chickenpox is not commonly vaccinated against in the netherlands in the first place , so i imagine it would just follow population density . 
  i did a quick search for some data , but came up with very little . 
  i did find [ this ] ( http://www.rivm.nl/documenten_en_publicaties/wetenschappelijk/rapporten/2016/april/the_national_immunisation_programme_in_the_netherlands_developments_in_2012?sp=cxvlcnk9khdhdgvycg9ra2vukttjtkxjqljbulk9dhj1ztttsvrftefor1vbr0u9bmw7c2vhcmnoymfzzt0wo3nlyxjjahjhbmdlptuwo3nlyxjjagv4chjlc3npb249u0luruxbtkdvqudfieforcbjtkxjqljbulkgqu5eifnjvevmqu5hvufhrttzb3j0zmllbgq9chvibglzagrhdgu7c29ydhjldmvyc2vkpxrydwu7&amp;query=waterpokken&amp;pagenr=1&amp;result=rivmp%3a203448 ) , but it does n't mention any locations . 
  neither does it for measles , mind , although it does mention that religious beliefs and anthroposophic beliefs are primary reasons for not vaccinating . 
  research into varicella zoster epidemiology seems to focus on age rather than location , which makes sense to me at least . 
  if you do find something , please let me know , 
  we do n't need to show causation , we know the strict protestants do n't vaccinate their children because they give their religion as reason , and we know they mostly vote sgp as well . 
  this is just a visualisation of what is already known . 
  [ edit ] if you 're claiming we need to show a causal relationship between vaccination rate and rates of measles cases , i ca n't help you . 
  yay more stereotypes to explain polling data through anecdotal evidence !, 
  i take it you 're not the biggest fan of the eu ? 
  not included due to cheesiness , 
  since all own-language music is game \u2020 i 'd like to add a song that i 've lately listened to death , by the recently departed maarten van roozendaal . 
  hardly popular stuff , but i love it : * [ maarten van roozendaal - mooi ( 2 ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcepen_oilc ) further : * [ acda en de munnik - het regent zonnestralen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzkbha1nctm ) * [ wende snijders - dutch version of la solitude : de eenzaamheid ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmsc0cs9lqy ) * [ stef bos - papa ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wxvtib6qe4 ) * [ luie hond - poes in de playboy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2cqlwwvub0 ) is dialect allowed ?

  awesome !, 
  i thought i would n't be able to get those here , but apparently grey peas are very similar to dutch capucijners . 
  i 'll be making [ the following ] ( http://dutchfood.about.com/od/mainmeals/r/monksmince.htm ) soon then , only substituting in grey peas . 
  you would n't know if grey peas are easy to get a hold of in the uk , would you ? 
  greater london has a higher density and total population though . 
  i think something else must be going on . .
