holy what the f * ck , i was expecting to be great power , not a major power . 
  his majesty the living god-emperor of japan , korea , the philippines and manchuria is very pleased with the current progress . 
  edit : could you also give us a post-game map of the world ? 
  that * is * the way to go at it , yeah . 
  join the steam group chat , there we will announce a restart . 
  expect it between 21.15 and 21.30 cest . 
  sure as hell i am . 
  i 'd love to see it in action . 
   ** - what happens if i miss a session ? 
  can i come back ? 
  ** ** answer : ** absolutely !, 
  the usual rule is that you can also pick any nation unless someone played it previously , in which case , that someone has priority . 
  but if he is n't there when we play , you can take it for at least that session . 
  if an absentee going to be late to a session and do n't want to lose your nation please post in the weekly thread so we know you wo n't be showing up . 
  if you give notice , you can miss ** one ** whole session and still have the right to your nation when you come back . 
  so yeah , no problem for one week . 
  keep in mind that we can not guarantee the status of your nation for 1 session , you know how the ai can be . 
  should you miss 2 sessions , someone can claim your nation in the second session , so keep that in mind . 
  guys , the game is up and running . 
  claiming the japanese islands once again . 
  see you guys saturday . 
  no one in japan ? 
  then i 'll take it !, 
  i 'm willing to host the first game ( if i 'm still in time ) . 
  got all the dlc 's and a good internet speed . 
  edit : i 've also got a good , young pc . 
  that is also quite important . 
  and if needed i 'll stay longer . 
  * since / u/al-quti is not in a position to make this thread , he asked me to do it . 
  he 'll absent this session as well . 
  ( good luck ai sweden ) * on the 28st of may at [ 7 pm bst ] ( http://time.is/bst ) , [ 8 pm cest ] ( http://time.is/cest ) , we start a new eu4 session . 
  we will be continuing with previous week 's match . 
  the game will last 4 hours per session . 
  however , you can drop off at any time before that . 
  no hard feelings !, 
  for any new player who missed the last session : you are welcome to join our game . 
  please keep in mind that about 45 years have passed since we started playing , and some 'em pty ' nations are in a bad position compared to the players surrounding them . 
  you might want to take this into consideration when picking a country . 
  but in the end , you are to free to pick any non-player nation . 
  [ here is our list of player-nations , also the ranking among them ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lnwee6p9tbjciuoqpcoyj1tnaznqmcze58evzp6pawo/edit#gid=966539433 ) ** to join : ** [ this is / r/europe 's steam group ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/europereddit ) . 
  it is open for anyone to join so you do n't even need an invitation . 
  there are two ways to join the actual game . 
  ** first way : ** once you are in , we can invite you , just remind us to in the steam group 's chat . 
  you can also directly join by clicking join game on someone already in the lobby that is also in the group chat . 
  ** second way : ** [ myself ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/dslisser/ ) will be hosting . 
  if you add me as a friend on steam , you can join by : * entering eu4 and going into the multiplayer window ( if you were in single player , you need to restart eu4 ) * open your friends list . 
  * click on my profile * click join game button as pictured here [ friend profile ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oiyscji.png ) ( that is n't my profile , just an example ) ** faq : ** * - do we use some sort of communication tool ? 
  * yes !, 
  for anything other than super secret plots ( for which we recommend eu4 's whisper and chat groups functionality ) , we use teamspeak . 
  you do n't have to join it , but we strongly recommend it . 
  if you do n't know how to set it up , please ask . 
  the teamspeak server details are : address : 185.4.149.102:9152 room : eu4game password : europe ** - what happens if i miss a session ? 
  can i come back ? 
  ** ** answer : ** absolutely !, 
  the usual rule is that you can also pick any nation unless someone played it previously , in which case , that someone has priority . 
  but if he is n't there when we play , you can take it for at least that session .

  if you give notice , you can miss ** one ** whole session and still have the right to your nation when you come back . 
  ** - i can only join for 3 hours , not 4 , is that fine ? 
  ** ** answer : ** then join for 3 hours and leave before 4 . 
  that 's fine  ** - i came 10 minutes late and you have already started / i crashed / i got annexed and disconnected , what do ? 
  ** ** answer : ** we will be playing with a ton of people . 
  that means we unfortunately ca n't be restarting every time someone joins or disconnects . 
  we will be having ~ 2 restarts total for everyone that came late or crashed to be able to rejoin , so it 's not the end of the world . 
  in general the first one will be around 21:15 cest ** - i am bad at this game ** you are absolutely welcome !, 
  most of us were n't experienced players in the last game and we had a ton of fun with a lot of wars , plots , politics , etc. 
  ** - i have never played this game before ** you are also absolutely welcome but ... you probably wo n't enjoy this . 
  the game is super complicated and you wo n't understand most things and a 20-40 player game is usually a wild west mess so that would make it even harder to understand . 
  i would personally suggest skipping this week and trying the game in sp first - and then join us once you know at least some basics . 
  it is really fun !, 
  ** - my internet is trash , can i join anyway ? 
  ** ** answer : ** sure but ... your internet probably ca n't handle it if it 's really bad . 
  if you slow down the game too much , it 's not practical to participate . 
  we need to keep a consistent speed 2 and if you ca n't handle that ... sorry . 
  if you are not sure , feel free to join and see how it goes  *************************** ** - rules ? 
  ** answer : we 're figuring out the ideal ruleset as we go . 
  there will be some changes from last time , mostly surrounding player alliances . 
  ** all rules will be subject to change based on player vote after we reach 1650 ** * ** we are removing the basic player alliance limit . 
  ** you used to be limited strictly to 2 player alliances . 
  the rule was more or less useless , as we could easily coordinate larger blocks of player nations anyway . 
  the following rules are up for consideration . 
  please discuss them in the comments below - we will pick a finalized rule set before the game starts , taking into account your feedback . 
  top 3 ca n't ally 2 . 
  gps are top 8 and a gp can only have 1 other gp ally , non gps are limited to 2 gp allies . 
  gps are reduced to top 6 at 1650 , potentially not counted post 1750 and only the top 3 ca n't ally rule remains . 
  alliance limit is lifted . 
  bringing a new ally in during a war is not allowed except via enforce peace . 
  if you pick a vassal or pu in the first round ( rule in regards to picking pu/vassal kept ) you have to achieve independance within 2 sessions/60years failure to do so or a failed independance war means losing control of your nation . 
  cn rules kept , limitation to nations supporting independance should match alliance limitations . 
  no timelimit on achieving independance alternatively very late game time limit 8 . 
  being force-vassalized/force-pu 'd means game over . 
  pu by monarch death should be either immediately dissolved or a similar limitation to starting subjects . 
  ex 30 years to get independance or so . 
  ** addendum to the above rules : ** * ** how do you pick the top six ? 
  ** we have our own formula , that reflects real power better than the in-game score . 
  basically , your income , land forcelimits , and naval forcelimits matter , in that order . 
  subject force limits may count in some way from this session on . 
  * ** after the first round , you are not allowed to pick a vassal or pu ( personal union ) of a player nation without the permission of that player . 
  ** you can pick one at the 1st round 's start though . 
  * ** you are allowed to play a player 's colonial nation ( i.e.
