but if we are germans and the swedes are not dutch ... where do the dutch live then ? 
  bloody spaniards if we had n't lost so much money on fighting them on the mainland of europe ... 
  i was actually pointing out the territories like the south of africa , the north-eastern coast of the us and india before we lost those to the brits . 
  not christian as such , but he has indeed stated that * ` we should not forget the jewish-christian roots of our society ' . 
  * he uses the addition of * jewish * to legitimate the ban on islam in the netherlands . 
  wait a sec , there was another country that roamed the world with its empire before the british expansion . 
  * cough * now , do n't get us again in anglo-dutch sea wars . 
  besides we 're on the mainland and started all this benelux/ecsc/eu stuff . 
  so , it 's time to just move the european capital to the hague . 
  and to be honest . 
  you got a fair point there . 
  do n't visit * almere * , * leidsche rijn * , * vleuten * , * zoetermeer * , * leidschenveen * , * berkel en rodenrijs * , etc. . . if you wa n't to stay out of these carbon copy villages . 
  these places were built with efficiency in mind and - most probably - to let its inhabitants become depressive . 
  especially the first one i mentioned . 
  just do n't . 
  their infrastructure is . 
  ugly , bad and full of pitholes . 
  well , complaining about ( not ) having free wifi is not even a problem anymore here : they 're complaining about its speed over here . 
  free wifi is quite common over here . 
  and basically you can get it almost anywhere . 
  at train stations , in the bus , in the subway , and most city centers can make your mobile connection connection redundant . 
  but the point is , they are complaining about the speed and accesibility of the wifi . 
  hier is de wifi het sterkst . 
  ** translation : ** * after signing in , most of the inhabitants leave for the so-called ` wifi-hallway ' . 
  it 's the hallway that connects the two large buildings of the refugee centre in musselkanaal . 
  the wifi-reception is a its best over here . 
  it 's always crowded over there . 
  children are playing games on dated smartphones , adults are texting , skyping and surfing the web . 
  on many screens the face of a distant relative or friend is moving . 
  ** translation : ** * the hague - owners of the shops in the shopping mall de baronie in alphen a/d rijn have shut down their free wifi-network . 
  it could not handle the load anymore , because a lot of refugees specifically came to the shopping mall to roam the free internet . 
  * - lastly , punishment of downloading copyrighted material is almost non-existent over here as well . 
  ( i know that you guys are litteraly being hunted down , are n't you ? ), 
  so if they are in for a movie night , they could just bring their laptop to the nearest shopping mall/other hotspot , and enjoy the evening back at the centres . 
  countries that host more refugees , after subtracting some * generous administration fee * for juncker and van baalen . 
  they do n't even call these refugees temporary anymore in our news . 
  everything seems to be focused on permanent settling . 
  as a response on the cumbersome integration of these refugees , the media hope * they will integrate more quickly * . 
  it 's exactly this what a lot of people actually do ** not ** want i think . 
  so , whether that war will continue for 4 decades or stops abruptly tomorrow , i think we should already settle with the thought that we have a few million permanent new residents in europe . 
  do n't even think a large part of them wants to rebuild their country in the case the war will be over there . 
  but look , ned/ger/swe / nor offer free wifi , free money , ~ ~ free pussy every now and then ~ ~ / s i do n't even blame the refugees . 
  i blame our governments for making these social policies so generous . 
  they get ~ ~ loans ~ ~ gifts/tax exemptions so generous , heck , i should just join the row in the balkan route , as i think it would make the funding of my current study a lot easier . 
  but hey , i could sort of live with their financial benefits ... ( if it would only last for their first year or so ) it 's the other kind of protection . 
  juridical protection that actually baffles me . 
  would portugal guarantee this as well ? 
  just imagine how much similar sinister projects would fail if every governmental proposal , treaty , etc was subject to full transparency . 
  and even despite that , i believe that of course not everything could and should be accessed publically . 
  but this treaty was in my opinion just equal to self-harm for europe . 
  will they fine us for having nexit campaigns every now and then as well ? 
  because that 's how you will get more of them . 
  hm yes , i already started to think i needed a visa to enter some neighborhoods of rotterdam and the hague . 
  i never looked at it in that way . 
  0 . o but it does n't even sound that stupid , haha !, 
  great find , m8 . 
  apart from the name of the bundesl\u00e4nder , how much do the people in sachsen , sachsen-anhalt and niedersachsen have in common ? 
  i mean oldenburg and dresden are not really alike , are they ? 
  somehow , in my head these states are connected because of their names , but i find it hard to believe they actually are alike . . 
  * explanation : when germany was split in two countries , west germany used to have tv and radio towers of the ard ( german public broadcaster ) near the border of the east germany aiming to spread western news in the east . 
  although they managed to cover most of east germany , some parts around dresden and the eastern part of vorpommern could n't be reached and so people in these areas were unable to receive western news . 
  these parts were satirically called `` tal der ahnungslosen '' ( valley of the clueless ) *, 
  i 've posted this link as i 'm also quite interested in what the background of heiko maas and this demonstration is . 
  so far i 've understood that the dgb is a large trade union in germany . 
  the minister of justice has been chased away , and had to flee the stage and drive away under the pressure of the crowd . 
  translation : the minister of justice has been insulted during his speech in zwickau on the international workers ' day . 
  the stage had to protected by a police line of defence . 
  `` i am shocked !, 
  i have never witnessed something like this during my speeches , i have given since 1992 . 
  it is sad , that the people have used the 1st of may ( international worker 's day ) for their uproar . '', 
  the minister had asked the police to not intervene . 
  the cops , however , saw the necessity to act , when the demonstants started to push towards the stage with signs . 
  at this time a line of defense was created to protect the stage . 
  really ? 
  the contemporary unified state of germany is rather young and even now , it is one of the most federalist country of europe . 
  though they are trying to change the federalism a bit now , as it has been proven a little bit ineffective when it comes to e.g. 
  different education systems . 
  especially weird if considering the fact that the cdu was in favor of nuclear energy before , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  merkel literally dropped everything the party stood for in the past , right ? 
  that link you gave over there is truly a nice work of information gathering . 
  4th picture on reuters : * `` gegen rasismus und frauenfeindlichkeit '' * ( against racism and women hostility ) . 
  it 's something i 've never understood . 
  it is an exact copy of the protests after the incidents in k\u00f6ln / cologne on new year 's eve . 
  although some afd voters may not be the most moderated people in their expressions , they actually went to vote the afd because they could n't stand what happened to so many girls and women . 
  or more specifically , the fact that so many governmental institutions do not want to intervene in any practical and effective way . 
  well yes , they are handing out guides translated into arabic on `` how to treat girls in swimming pools '' ... 
  i have n't seen the effectiveness of that , i 'm sorry . 
  i wish it would be . 
  i just want to say that they are protesting for a good cause , but they do n't want to see there is a correlation between the two : and it 's reciprocal . 
  you can wish for both , but it will be at the cost of a lot more victims . 
  but hey , i will probably be called an * asi ** if i write something like this , so that 's the reason i always skip political topics and propose a topic change when i 'm speaking with my german friends . 
  * ^ ^ german ^ ^ word ^ ^ for ** ^ ^ chav ** ^ ^ , working-class ^ ^ vulgar ^ ^ person ^ ^ with ^ ^ low ^ ^ education, 
  yes , it has the phrase * `` ben ik , van duitsen bloed '' * which , in present-day dutch means * am i , of german blood * . 
  though historically , this term refers to how people in this part of the holy roman empire referred to themselves , namely * diets * . 
  which in old dutch and in old franconian and saxon ment `` people '' . 
  so , * deutschland * actually means `` land of the people '' , and in the low franconian dialects ( eventually becoming dutch ) the vowel had shifted towards * ui * instead of * eu * . 
  exactly , it 's working the other way around now in our countries . 
  politics do n't control the media , the media control the politics . 
  the netherlands has had a wage restraining policy since the nineties to protect the heavily export oriented economy . 
  https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2015/29/netherlands-has-the-seventh-largest-trade-surplus-in-the-world wages are kept a little bit lower so the value of the exported goods stay attractive .
