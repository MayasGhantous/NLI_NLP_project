  it 's okay to miss the past and it 's okay to talk about it - but we have to seek ways forward , and find a way for everyone to live together . 
  because now we have a europe and a sweden that is what it is : in a state of change . 
    it 's time to realise that new swedes will take up room with cultures , languages and customs , and it 's time we see this as a positive force . 
  the new country is about shaping a new future . 
  being swedish needs to be about more than skin color and place of birth . 
  it needs to be you , me and everyone together . 
  it 's not just new swedes who need to integrate . 
  everyone needs to be integrated , established swedes too . 
  integration does not mean that one party should adapt to the other , or that everyone should think , do and feel the same . 
  integration is about meetings , and real meetings are built on reciprocity . 
  let us create a future based on both realism and vision , in equal measure . 
  let 's formulate a greater sense of `` we '' and let 's build a country where we put hatred and fears aside . 
  we all have the new country within us ; in our views , thoughts and actions . 
  the time has come to build a country that is proud , inclusive and sustainable - something new . 
    the new country .

  this has to be made into a polandball comic, 
  yes , when i think of * grammar schools * in the uk , i think of schools like * eton college * etc. . 
   in finland , children do not start formal academic learning until seven . 
  that age ( 7 years ) is n't that special , is it ? 
  i mean , in most countries children start at 6 years . 
  at least they do here . 
  children start at the age of 4 ( 2 years earlier than in other european countries ) , yet they do n't have formal/academical learning until the age of 6 . 
  the netherlands , germany and belgium all have grammar schools ( * gymnasium * ) , albeit publicly funded ones , yet these countries perform quite well too . 
   driven by a commitment to equality ( on both moral and economic grounds ) , it outlaws school selection , formal examinations ( until the age of 18 ) and streaming by ability . 
  i do n't believe per se that equal education for everyone , such as in france for example is the way to go . 
  leveling could even help students . 
  dutch education is characterised by subdivision by level . 
  it is actually designed in such way that students attending the higher levels get less distraction and can profile more , while students attending the lower levels get extra support , more practical education which is aimed at preparing the pupils at the job market faster . 
  the key of this concept : easy switching . 
  if a student gets better grades , it 's relatively easy to move upwards , and vice versa . 
  and nothing is determined by money , unlike the grammar schools in the uk . 
  but yeah , i suppose this will be against the * equality * principles of the guardian . 
  though , concentration ability and intelligence are n't distributed among people equally , and maybe we should aim on delivering tailored education instead of clinging to that * equality * principle . 
  some dutch political parties have been making hysteria about the bad intergenerational mobility in the netherlands , since we have got a heavily subdivided education system , though sources prove different : [ intergen .

  ( especially gymansia are known to have a bit more expensive school trips to either italy and greece due to education of classic languages ),

  invention by filthy western spies . 
  and they named _ lada _ after a ship . 
  yes, 
  _ ldpr _ and _ kprf _ are puppet parties or parties led by total morons , as far as i remember . 
  so no , putin is still safe ... _ yabloko _ ( apple ) is a true opposition party , as in : they really oppose putin 's current policies and seek closer ties with europe . 
  egh , never understood this really . 
  we have people who freak out on the border fence of hungary , yet the same people fanatically say there should be a fence around our province of _ limburg _ and they would be glad if we gave that province to germany for free . 
  yes , they have an accent over there . 
  though i like that accent somehow . 
  same must be for the accent of the swabians ? 
  a german with empathy for greece ? 
  you must be the original hipster afd-hater , before it became cool . 
  :p / s, 
  but it is n't just hope anymore . 
  originally 900 was hoped for , but germany and the netherlands reached an agreement of 450 . 
  with elections coming up , i bet they will . 
  and will cover this extensively in the news . 
  oh , the mods would probably like to see a translation , otherwise they might delete this thread . 
  though i 'm too short on time now to provide you one ... english article from dutchnews.com :  the netherlands is to return 450 asylum seekers to germany because they should have requested refugee status there under eu rules . 
  germany earlier refused to accept 900 refugees but agreement has now been reached on the transfer of 450 , the volkskrant said . 
  the netherlands argues that their claims should be processed in germany because that is where their fingerprints had been registered . 
  this , officials say , is enough to return them to germany under the dublin agreement . 
  that deal says that refugee claims should be processed in the first eu country the asylum seeker reaches . 
  the ruling had been made more flexible following the surge of syrian refugees in 2015 . 
  germany in particular said it would have been unfair on athens to return them all to greece . 
  now numbers have gone down sharply , the netherlands has renewed its efforts to return some people to germany , the volkskrant said . 
  good , and i 'm quite sure that a lot of others also registered somewhere in austria , italy and greece before that . 
  i can see more dublin processes coming up if they will be consequent from now on . 
  haha , but at the same time they still mean it . 
  yes , though normally , people who do self-mutilation and self-harm get psychological treatment . 
  in germany , people are encouraged to undergo this instead . 
  * cough * benelux * cough *, 
   misunderstandings * triggering intensifies * btw , did you know that 's some spot on soft bigotry of low expectations over there ? 
   and what afd accomplishments exactly would you like them to write about ? 
  i guess you have n't been living under a stone and heard something about the landtagswahlen . 
  their result is quite noteworthy , not only because of their actually huge jump in the results ( from 0 % to ~ 20 % ) in st , bw , rp , mv , but also since the main media outlets have literally been warning people for voting on them . 
  the ndr went in full anti-afd reporting in the days before the mv-elections and they still got 20 % . 
  so , i would call that an accomplishment . 
   they are n't part of any state governments , they are n't in the national parliament . 
  well , if most people , especially those responsible for the current politics , do n't change anything into a truly effective policy concerning immigration , they will soon . 
  unless it is turned around 180 degrees from now on , i dare to bet the afd will be in the bundestag by fall 2017 . 
  it 's `` soft biassedness '' . 
  it 's hard to accuse the current main stream media in europe for misreporting things , but they have become good in changing subtle details . 
  muslims are a group of young men . 
  foreign borns are natives as soon as they have another passport in possession as well . 
  way too obvious motivations remain unclear since they are still not rock solid proved . 
  it is n't untrue ... yet it is n't the full true story either . 
  just look over here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/524fxy/in_france_another_item_of_clothing_has_become_a/ the triggering has turned into an apathy when i watch television news , when they yet again report about some ` refugee welcoming ' group . 
  it 's like they have set up a whole division at our public broadcasters , just to create empathic content . 
  plans to open and build new refugee centres in the netherlands have been cancelled or set to a lower priority as the influx has been under the expected value . 
  the next day , multiple newspapers and news outlets had seriously found people to interview who reported that they were saddened by the news . 
  reportedly , there were * tears * among the inhabitants of the villages that would have got a refugee centre ... 
  this was main news ... :| if they ca n't provide me true news-worthy content , of which i 'm convinced there is plenty of , then i will just stick to other news sources . 
   ... do they not see the irony in that statement ? 
  if regressive leftists understood irony , the regressive left would n't exist . 
   without it historically we tend to descend into chaos . 
  ... whilst dominating the world . 
  there is . 
  the last one . 
  some anarchists walked in the bremain protests , ask them . 
  communist media : you are not allowed to publish what people do n't know western media : you are not allowed to publish what people already know,
