  originally the track was intended for fyra service . 
  the thalys only drives at high-speed up to a few tens of kilometers before rotterdam ( where the high-speed track merges with the normal rail network ) . 
  between rotterdam and amsterdam this speed is never reached . 
  netherlands is not correct . 
  it has been in service for just a few weeks . 
  the project has already been under construction for years , and constantly delayed by safety problems and eventually even indefinitely postponed since we do n't have the right trains for these high-speed stretches . 
  the result is that we have the expensive rail network ready , but there are no high speed trains driving on this stretch . 
  we bough _ fyra _ high-speed trains from the italian company _ ansaldobreda _ , but they had never made high-speed trains before : the delivered trains were apparently not resistant to snow and components fell off during the ride . 
  the dutch state owned train company ns tried to return the trains and cancel the order , but this ended in a long lawsuit , as eb did n't accept them back . 
  currently , only ` normal ' trains drive on this high-speed track which do not go faster than approx . 
  [ fyra debacle ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/fyra ) hundreds of millions have gone down the drain in this project ( including the numerous delays in railway construction . ), 
   reinheitsgebot good thing i checked out the actual law ... 
  i already thought for a sec it referred to some other kind of * purity * ... 
  ** tl ; dr ** for this thread : [ removed ], 
  it 's on dutch television . 
  the satirical programme is called '' _ koefnoen _ '' . 
  it 's been running already for quite some seasons . 
  ... and afd went from 21 % to 21,8 %, 
   gr\u00fcne falling under the 5 % hurdle will also shift some seats around , not enough to jeopardize the csu/spd coalition , but it may very well make the margins even thinner . 
  i actually expect that to strengthen the red/black-coalition . 
  especially since the spd after all , is still the biggest party . 
  furthermore , keep in mind that greens have a relatively high amount of letter voters . 
  wake me up when there will be a photo of the gr\u00fcne and afd shaking hands together . 
  it 's a small state ( 1,6 million ) , so i expect in the evening , otherwise tomorrow in the morning for sure . 
  they have already published the first prognosis and exit-polls . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** red/black-coalition survives .

  great television . 
  have been waiting for this new season now . 
  * looks eastwards ... looks westwards ... * see how handy those subtitles are ? 
  you can still follow our programmes . 
  ^ ^ * continues ^ ^ the ^ ^ keyboard ^ ^ war ^ ^ for ^ ^ a ^ ^ world ^ ^ wide ^ ^ implementation ^ ^ of ^ ^ closed ^ ^ captions *, 
   we do n't fucking want them here . 
  send them to the fucking moon and establish the first colony there god help us if the colonists find gold/helium -3 / * something valuable * on the moon ... 
  am i a bad person for getting the reference and laughing out loud now ? 
  i have no doubt afd will perform better at the voting booth than in polling . 
  people do n't like to admit they are supporting a party that is constantly portrayed by the media and the establishment as racist and extremist . 
  the highest result according to the polls prior to the elections in sachsen-anhalt tipped around 18 - 19 % for the afd : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/landtagswahl_in_sachsen-anhalt_2016#umfragen yet they eventually even got 24 %, 
  you know what 's ironic ? 
  even if we consider the afd to be * far-right * for now , the other parties have been trying in all their effort to get a share in the electoral success of the afd . 
  the afd might be on the * far-right * spectrum , but every other party has been carefully tweaking and altering their narrative and stances just a tad to the right , in the hope to hush their angered voters . 
  even the spd is trying to overtake the cdu on the right-hand side by telling that merkel is disconnected from reality after repeating `` wir schaffen das '' for the nth time . 
  while blaming the afd to be * far-right * , they silently try minimise their losses by accepting their stances bit by bit . 
  they will only start to panic when they realise that calling the afd neo-nazistic and calling their voters ' base to be illiterate , does n't work anymore to stop their surge . 
  for now , especially the media and public broadcasters are still convinced it will work . 
  none of them actually addressing the reasons why people left the traditional parties . 
  should n't it be 88 , or am i missing some reference ? 
  i hear that more often . 
  and usually those people tell me that they have convincingly been voting left for a long time . 
  age does something to people . 
  perhaps it is the gained realism . 
   vinger spotted the dutch, 
  never heard anymore from them after she got that position . 
  this does not hold in the netherlands . 
  municipalities and cities with higher immigration also deliver the biggest relative voters base for anti-immigration and `` populist '' parties . 
  rotterdam for example has shown this trend since the breakthrough of the first anti-immigration parties in the early 2000s ( lr , lpf ) and the current ( pvv ) is still faring high in the polls over there . 
  same accounts for other cities with large amounts of foreign born citizens , such as den haag . 
  these cities usually display a high polarisation . 
  there is no central party in these cities . 
  rural municipalities tend to vote more traditional parties like the cda , which is the dutch equivalent to the cdu , or left wing parties like our socialist party . 
  but you know , reading the british tabloid circus and everything that it caused as a foreigner is just first class amusement . 
  [ there is ] ( https://youtu.be/39_7chrv01y?t=81 ), 
  they conveniently lost their minds just two days before an election . 
  * ( normally a relatively irrelevant one , but the fact that we ( ! ), 
  get daily coverage of the mv elections on the dutch news now , says about how loaded they are ) *, 
  this is some excerpt i have quickly been able to find from the dutch news : http://nos.nl/video/2122950-vluchtelingen-in-voormalig-olympisch-dorp.html ( first video , has only dutch/italian commentary and dutch subs ) short summary : the journalists are called racists , threatened and can only film with the protection of the carabinieri ( sort of higher police , never understood this ) . 
  it 's just exactly the same story all over again as the australian film crew in rinkeby , stockholm in sweden . 
  journalists get kicked out , because they entered the ghetto . 
  this is how the athletes ' hotels in turin looks like now : https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77fb4f1cec7c7b82a1e74655552e41cdd2437ad2/0_96_3147_2352/master/3147.jpg?w=1920&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9a9177893bc028c3e90b3d47cbb2baed fully inhabited by refugees , who actually want to switzerland or germany . 
  ( photo from the left-oriented article on the same issue : https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/02/turin-refugees-italy-abandoned-olympic-village ), 
  i know it 's a damn small land ( number of inhabitants ) , but you have elections in two days , right ? 
  * mumbles something about some extra seats to the afd *, 
  some footage of towns in northern italy have been featured in the dutch news . 
  my god . 
  especially the region of torino up to the swiss border ... that olympic village has become a no-go zone . 
  what if ... ! remindme 5 years, 
  roflol faith in german humour restored . 
  lol , funnily though , i know some from the region around hannover/braunschweig and i relatively have a harder time understanding them than someone with a slight bayerisch or austrian dialect . 
  ( if not too strong though ) especially the vocals seem to be far less clearly pronounced in standard german to me ... 
   that said , never underestimate exponential growth . 
   between this and what they did to greece , i 'm really starting to think what the hell is wrong with germany ? 
  why ca n't this country go on a couple of years without the need to fuck over their neighbors ? 
  just watch zdf mittagsmagazin , wdr aktuelle stunde , ndr local news , etc. . . tax money funded indoctrination . 
  exactly , the biggest shitpile has n't even become visible yet . 
  await their offspring . 
  and await theirs . 
  with fertility rates three times higher than their native counterpart , and radicalisation among younger generations , i 'm afraid whole cities will turn into islamic enclaves . 
  i am not sure , at the same time it 's food for the public debate to prove that these populist right-wing policies are useless . 
  these bans , and even more , the burqini bans are symbolic . 
  i approve a burqa ban , but for the reason that in public places it poses a security threat , just as you will not allow someone to wear a balaclava . 
  if i see someone wearing one of those in a shopping centre , i bet i would call the police . 
  this is quite old . 
  i think it even has appeared here somewhere during the b\u00f6hmerman news . 
  we got fjords , i could live with that . 
  except for the fact that flevoland is the ugliest province of the country . 
  it 's so ugly , including its cities , that i do n't want to be found dead over there . 
  i hope they will make the new ones somehow prettier . 
  this was last year 's report . 
  the event is currently being held as well at the moment , right ? 
  yes , soon we will be hungry for more clay .
