  we will start reclaiming the entire north sea . 
  this certainly poses an explanation for everything from * eggie * to * mud wrestling * ... 
  well , ansbach is not the only case from the past year , is it ? 
  my cautioness has certainly been awakened by all recent events , either in france or in belgium ... and yes , this includes - how unfortunate it may be - certain anxiety for , let 's say , * bearded men * at these locations , although this has been catalysed as well by some recent unfortunate personal experiences in a city such as intimidation and verbal aggression . 
  to be honest , if i would visit a larger city a mere 10 years ago , the only thing that i would be cautious for were pickpocket thieves . 
  if i 'm walking at central stations of big cities now , i 'm somehow expecting to happen more than that . 
  am i the only one who 's more baffled by the name of the town ? 
  so that \u0142 is more of a * w * , if i remember correctly . 
  so that 's a * wbrz * ? 
  how ? 
  [ comparison ] ( http://925.nl/cms_img/schermafbeelding_20160425_om_132437_1.png ) just some idealist , that thinks every idea has ground by saying '' * because it 's 2015 . 
  femke halsema was at least a politician , whether you agreed with her or not . 
  but klaver is just a kid , with idealistic dreams who lost solid ground under his feet . 
  eu is already plunging money in palestinia for some time . 
  i doubt how much better it has become because of the grants . 
  the greens we have are just as fucked up . 
  and it certainly is n't going in the right direction now we have this trudeau imitator as head of the party . 
  am i allowed to ask a perhaps quite loaded and controversial question ? 
  do you have an idea to what extent the process of * entnazifizierung * in the late 40s and 50s contributed to the rise of these kind of thoughts and ideas ? 
  in the 50s the fdp already urged for a stop as this process sometimes just went too far in their opinion and was deliberately set-up to increase the guilt and delude the german population . 
  now , perhaps i can understand if it was carried out then , but i get the impression that this ancestral guilt after multiple generations is still being abused by these extreme leftists to approve their self-destructive ideology . 
  oh , and do you still have this separate course during high school about this period of history ? 
  like besides the actual history course ? 
  someone once showed me a course book whose title was something like '' * the acts of the germans during the nazism and how to life with it nowadays * '' i 'm actually interested in the way this book is written . 
  get yourself a mechanical one . 
  they will stand some more enraged typing and those can come in handy if you want to physically out your frustrations onto some as well . 
  they are in norway . 
  * divide and conquer * / s no , but in all honesty : i do n't know for sure , and i doubt anyone here on reddit is able to provide a covering answer . 
  anyways , i 've found more documents , covering all funded organisations in the netherlands . 
  they are all related to anti-discrimination , promoting positive image of muslims , even a organisation that describe their task as :  * the project aims to facilitate a better understanding of the effects of ethnic profiling and a willingness to question these practices and look for alternative approaches . 
  [ ... ] the purpose of this grant is to strongly encourage the dutch police to take a stand against stereotyping and prejudices by dutch police officers in their working practice towards migrants and people of migrant origin , and to empower youngsters from migrant origin to record , edit and publish possibly discriminatory police behaviour . 
  * [ source ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/archives/images/osifenetherlands.pdf ) i will submit more if i find some clear documents that feature this information ordered in a nice way . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4xt3v2/overview_of_european_electionsrelated_grants_from/ grants = / = manipulations , yet if you look at the list : * kieskompas * is a dutch website where swing voters can decide which party suits them best in the upcoming election by answering some questions on hot topics . 
  why does this website receive grants from the same organisation that also several political non-profit organisations ? 
  yeah , our dikes and barriers are protecting our country so well nowadays , we do n't get a chance anymore to practice . 
  i want to give some nuance on this * law proposal * . 
  yes , indeed , a few months ago an initiative from a mp from the labour party existed to propose a ban on all non-electric vehicles by 2025 . 
  yet , most parties have seen this just to be unfeasible within this time-span . 
  instead , the proposal has been weakened to an * urge to sell solely electric vehicles by 2025 * . 
  * there will be no ban on the sale of fossil fuelled cars as the labour party wanted , and instead the netherlands should try to urge for a sale of solely ( new ) zero-emission vehicles by 2025 . 
  those heavy batteries pose some serious engineering challenges if you do n't want to get your intestines to become one big slush puppy on the belgian roads . 
  ah ... the feeling when entering the dutch tarmac surface when coming from abroad ... * ^ ^ looks ^ ^ to ^ ^ the ^ ^ east ^ ^ as ^ ^ well . . * ... smooth as a baby 's bottom, 
  u wot m8 ? 
  trains get delayed by 3 minutes sometimes , and shit ... 
  everyone smokes weed . 
  * while actually having a lower than average usage per capita in europe *, 
  cheaper , more practical , more fail-safe , longer action radius , larger market , more choice . 
  but hey , at least * cheaper * wo n't be that much of a problem , more a relative issue . 
  with our purchase tax for vehicles nearing denmark 's , road taxes topping far above of those of other eu countries and with petrol prices sharing the first place with norway . 
  :p if i remember correctly , we are tesla 's third market . 
  it is a common name in the northern part of the netherlands as well , albeit written a tad different : * fraukje * or sometimes * froukje * , but sharing the same origin and etymology . 
  it is a diminutive in older dutch and german of the word * frau * ( or * vrouw * in dutch , yet pronounced exactly the same ) meaning ` woman ' . 
  so it 's a ` little woman ' , or just ` girl ' . 
  the * ou * and * au * sound can be compared to the sound you make when you say : `` wow '' . 
  i 'm not sure about the current situation in germany . 
  i know , this gesetz has been quoted so often here , that i almost know its number by hard now . 
  as something like this would be in the netherlands , as it is even illegal by the first article of the dutch constitution . 
  yet in the last years , some politicians have been stunting with proposals to introduce gender quotas for top positions in companies . 
  and the problem i wanted to depict is : that more and more people would be willing to sacrifice this law , in an ultimate attempt to proof their good deeds . 
  so , a different approach or treatment ( * unterschiedliche behandlung * ) is allowed ** if ** by legal measures existing disadvantages can be compensated or equalized ( * ausgleichen * ) for ? 
  so , how far could someone for example extend this compensation of disadvantages ? 
  i 'm not familiar with law , but someone might help me to explain the juridical implication of these two paragraphs ... 
   push reluctant german companies so , what 's next ? 
  positive discrimination quotas ? 
  if there is a refugee witch sufficient qualifications and most of all enough fluency , he is quite likely to be hired . 
  i do n't think germans are xenophobic . 
  yet , most companies just simply have profit in mind , and hiring people who are underqualified , without decent language fluency is just not going to contribute to the companies ' efficiency in comparison to hiring natives . 
  as given by :  companies say most of the new arrivals lack the german language skills and the education required for a job . 
  moreover , this week i spoke a student in a pub in germany . 
  he tried to persuade me that * positive discrimination * is necessary to compensate the discrepancy . 
  first of all , on a sidenote , why do you guys randomly bring up these topics , as if looking for a confirmation for your deeds ? 
  anyways , i was baffled that even after trying to explain him that positive and negative discrimination are in principle the same concepts with just a different adjective , he was fiercely convinced that positive discrimination is a necessity . 
  equality is reached by taking away prejudices and removing true negative discrimination , not by overcompensation and starting a new chapter on ( positive ) discrimination . 
  my hope in this generation is diminishing . 
   the government wants to get as many as possible into the job market , which would reduce their dependence on the state and compensate for labour shortages as the workforce ages . 
  * but most msm still do n't know that a * refugee * and * immigrant * are two terms that form a contradictio in terminis if used for the same group of people . 
  ... i 've heard a lot of young skilled brits are willing to flee the uk ... 
  stay away with your baguettes . 
  we would rather flood our country intentionally than let you annex us , [ just like we did before ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-dutch_war ) . 
  we should more importantly acquire the information about the presence of nopes on the island as well . 
  this thread escalated quickly ... 
  [ this quite nicely sums up some of the ft headlines ] ( http://imgur.com/a/31nyq ), 
  we still have plenty of empty prisons over here !, 
  very international experience . 
  your mates will be norwegians , belgians and some swiss . 
  if you lack courts , we 've a large one spare as well . 
   skimped on infrastructure ah i always thought our caravans left your roads in such terrible condition . 
   while in the larger cities any grocery store smaller than 100sqm ( i think ) can be open on sundays . 
  ah perhaps that 's why they only opened a small part of the shop on sundays . 
  it may have been a legal restriction . 
  no i was n't particularly talking about tourist destinations . 
  have studied in norway for a half year . 
  those supermarket opening times just made me lazy haha , being able to get yourself a snack so easily at such times is something they should introduce over here as well . 
  only since a few years , most supermarkets extended their opening hours until 20h here . 
  before it has always been 18h , except on friday . 
  op 's flair checks out . 
  i was surprised to see the bunnpris and kiwi open on a sunday . 
  ah , that will be within my budget . 
  where can i order a few ? 
   you know , personal home and garden defence and such ...
