   your left is not that crazy to let 1 mil voters immigrants = extra voters base for spd and die linke . 
  they ca n't wait to grant them citizenship . 
  because gastarbeiter did n't . 
  and these peeps are from a similar background and/or culture . 
  they will feel at home here . 
  even in norway ? 
  where they even have crazy opening times for every supermarket until 23h even in the smallest villages ? 
  and quite a few of them opened on sunday as well . 
  is there some legislative barrier for furniture markets ? 
  / r/600euro ? 
  * heads towards poland * ( i 'm already half-way anyway ), 
  i propose a new border : https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:bakker_schut-plan.png, 
   18 , lol . 
  we 're doomed . 
  0,18 * 80 mln = 14,4 mln . 
  still more than our 0,15 * 17 mln = 2,55 mln . 
  so , you 'll probably still be safe if someone from us gets the bright idea to invade you . 
  lol , let them have amsterdam + almere then . 
  actually , they even might make a chance with a '' * crimea referendum * '' over there lol . 
  they will have to deal with the british tourists as well and we will get rid of the ugliest city of the country . 
  win-win . 
  * triggering intensifies *, 
   to dismiss criticism that the vvd is predominantly aimed at the economically well-to-do as ` jealous people ' is hyperbole of the highest degree as well . 
  because i 've noticed way to often that people are quite often called an * elitist * if they say they voted for them . 
  now * elitist * is n't used not derogatory that often . 
   `` buhuhu , the poors are jealous and should work harder . '', 
  i said * a part of * . 
  now i see that there is a group of people in need of social welfare , but i get confronted with lurkers just too often as well . 
  http://www.cpb.nl/publicatie/doorrekening-standaardkoopkracht-voorbeeldhuishoudens report from the statistics office netherlands on the purchasing power per welfare class . 
  chapter 4 , table 4.4 , section b12 . 
  studying for a median job gets you effectively $ 6,80 per day more than someone living from minimum wage . 
  that 's what nivellation by the social left has done . 
  how can this be motivating to get further ? 
  ( and yes , this table contains criticism on the vvd as well , because as soon you get the 1.5 x median , you do n't notice anything anymore from the taxation ) but it shows how the middle class , let 's assume while having studied more , ends up almost the same as the lower class of the society . 
  this is why i distrust social policies by the left so much . 
  and what 's the plus of that ? 
  are grand coalitions stable ? 
  the more concessions they have to do , the faster a coalition tends to collapse . 
  i hear this kind of reasoning sometimes about our liberal party as well , but it 's usually a hyperbole used by jealous people . 
  let 's say your income is that of a middle class household ( which statistically is quite reasonable ) , chances are pretty big that the big slogans of most parties will be aimed at either rewarding those who already acquired more or rewarding the lower class of the society . 
  middle class maybe has n't been favoured * that * much throughout history . 
  yet if i have to choose between those two , i would rather go with rewarding those who at least are capable of achieving something in their live , instead of seeing how a part of the tax money gets lurked by chavs . 
  ( and no , i am not rich myself , neither do i have rich parents )  so my only reason to go vote , is to hope that my vote reduces the relative size of votes the fdp gets , hopefully pushing it below 5 % , where they ca n't do any harm . 
  what 's this argumentation ? 
  it 's the worst kind of voting . 
  just because you do n't like one party you 'll choose whatever other party will come across ? 
  would you mind elaborating that stance a bit ? 
  so what is exactly the use of that 5 % limit ? 
  just a look at the landtagswahlen of sachsen anhalt for example : 4,9 % yet because of this hurdle all those votes have been rendered useless . 
  i usually have the idea that these kind of limits are designed to keep ruling parties in charge . 
  now , i do n't say our system ( no limit , just 1/150th of the house = 1 seat ) is great , as we currently have 16 fractions in the house of representatives . 
  the highest we ever had . 
  yes , and gopros on selfiesticks !, 
  burn them !, 
  '' * camels only have two stirrups !, 
  what kind of infidel invented this inefficient machinery ? 
  claymore mines ? 
  merkel is ( or at least was ) an opportunist . 
  she will change her opinion in time , hopefully , if the pressure will become too high . 
  i 'm talking about these stereotypical new leftists ( who exist ) , of which i personally know a few as well . 
  they will become infuriated as soon as you say you question current immigration politics , use all imaginable godwins and call you a nazi , etc. 
  it 's this view that 's being taken over by a lot of media . 
  you 're against or you are in favor of their view . 
  virtue signalling generation snowflake lefties . 
  they barely know what a * trade union * is , yet consider themselves to be * leftist * , since multicuturalism would be * leftist * and how can one be not a * leftist * as left is the only right ? 
   that 's kind of hard because most countries do n't classify their citizens by religion . 
  [ we do , yearly . 
  ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?vw=t&amp;dm=slnl&amp;pa=83288ned&amp;la=nl )  almost all unstable countries right now are muslim-majority . 
  usually due to conflicts with religious backgrounds . 
  ** syria ** : which is , aside from the isis-terror a fight between subdivisions of islam ( shi'a , sunni ) . 
  just as acts of retaliation currently being carried out in ** iraq ** after the liberation of iraqi villages by shi'a official troops . 
  just as the civil war currently going on in ** libya ** which is a war between different islamic factions . 
  just as terror that is carried out by the extremist islamic `` government '' in ** somalia ** . 
  just as terror that is carried out by the islamic tribes attacking ** sub-saharan countries ** at this moment . 
  but yes , maybe i should n't call this homicide , as we 're talking about states who are in state of war . 
   if you check german police reports for one full month you 'd arrive at the conclusion that `` black hair , dark skin color , accented german '' is almost a requirement for all sexual assaults reported when they want to find the perpetrator , many arrested for sexual assaults are tunisian or moroccan or whatever , so a correlation between specific crime types and ethnicity exists . 
  and between ethnicity and religion exists , as the example you mentioned is often the result of the way of living that islam spreads , i.e. 
  the different position of the woman with the respect to men in society . 
  do n't forget that islam is a way of life as well , not solely a religion . 
  at the same time i bet the aforementioned ethnicities will be overrepresented in a lot of other crime types as well such as theft and vandalism . 
  we even have created really politically correct terms to ascribe assailants and thiefs in the programs in which the police asks for any tips . 
  it 's like bingo , you just wait until the assailant is * slightly tanned , accented * - guy is mentioned 4 times in a row , which usually occurs in almost every episode of the program . 
  so , if we say that the number of * not tanned * - guys is negligible in comparison to these culture pearls ( which is a safe mathematical assumption to simplify arithmetics ) , we can say that the crime rates of this crime type are proportional to the relative abundance of these sand-people in a country . 
  under the assumption that they convict the crimes once , or at least all just as many times . 
   ( i have no intention to assault anyone , do n't report me ) ok mate . 
  i guess we are facing the same . 
  one ( our * labour party * ) is mockingly called the * immigrant 's party * , because the abbreviation in dutch is the same , whilst the other ( the * socialist party * ) has become a party for chavs who just vote because free welfare is promised . 
  the third ( * greenleft * ) is just lost and populated by feminists , ex-communists and such . 
  normal left parties are getting scarcer . 
  -- ** edit : ** pvda , sp , groenlinks-voters downplaying this post . 
  good job mate . 
  you have to vote at the voting ballots , not by up - / or downvoting this post . 
  is it so hard to just wait 6 more months ? 
  and for those who do n't believe me about * ex-communists * , [ communist party of the netherlands ( cpn ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_the_netherlands ) literally merged with greenleft in 1991 . 
   the party was founded in 1909 [ ... ] and merged with the pacifist socialist party , the political party of radicals and the evangelical people 's party in 1991 , forming greenleft . 
  just honestly asking , has anyone performed some simple regression analysis on the homicide/crime rate vs. relative muslim population for some countries ? 
  i bet mathematicians would get a huge boner on how good the ~ ~ linear ~ ~ exponential fit will be on the data . 
  there is a difference between sane socialists and the new regressive left . 
  do n't blame those who truly try to establish normal social welfare states in europe , blame those who currently hijack the left to spread their multicultural idealisms at any cost . 
  usually found in the far left and green corner of politics .
