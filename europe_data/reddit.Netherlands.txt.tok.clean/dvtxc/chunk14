  corruption for dummies lessons from a german , who would have thought ? 
   sadly you can not employ your wife or other family members as say a 10 000 $ secretary . 
  noes , you found out what i was aiming for ... 
  ... which gets you a pile of regulations that make your country not work . 
  tl ; dr for current eu . 
   `` it is unbelievable that meps receive an allowance of $ 22,000 to pay their employees and still find a way to have unpaid interns . '' wut ? 
  monthly ? 
  so , how do i become mep ? 
  nevertheless , i would never fly with either ryanair or easyjet , as their seat arrangement is as if they are transporting cattle . 
  and those space restraints just are n't funny if you 're almost 2 m ( 6 ' 6 '' ) . 
  actually , by massively buying new aircrafts from a single new type , purchase cost per unit and maintenance costs are considerably lower . 
  ah thanks . 
  it has been quite some time ago that i went through the series and i read the last time in german anyway ( to improve my vocabulary , i usually stick to untranslated originals ) , so i did n't immediately make the connection . 
  ryanair has the newest fleet of all european airlines . 
  really ? 
  actually , that was just the first explanation of the abbreviation that came to my mind . 
  xd sorry , i ca n't recall the reference . 
  ~ ~ istanbul ~ ~ constantinopel needs jesus as well . 
  harry potter, 
  a loader could be effective . 
   many germans : thanks austria and visegrad for doing our dirty work . 
  thanks macedonia . 
  it seems that `` fences can stop refugees '' . 
    media and politics : hooray merkel did it . 
  wahaha , our media still tries to tell us it 's all due to the glorious eu plan with turkey , the good guy turks and our de facto leader merkel . 
  they probably have never been able to afford travel themselves . 
  just when they are [ protesting in a library ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojauvqllxd0 ) , they have never been able to pass their gcse to get into university . 
  now they blame everyone who did manage to get in . 
  librarians studying orthodox wahhabistic literature . 
  dude , religious fanatics on drugs at your front door would be terrifying . 
  they would have an immense pain tolerance when you slam the door on their feet !, 
  no , i was talking about the `` r\u00f8dgr\u00f8d med fl\u00f8de '' - language . 
  contrary to common belief , * pennsylvanian dutch * has nothing to do with * dutch * , but with * deutsch * ( german ) . 
  i even have n't started about the other lines yet , from competiting public transport companies . 
  you did n't get it . 
  * urk * is one of those incestuous villages mostly inhabited by strongly protestant believers in the netherlands . 
  you just do n't want to live there . 
  it 's not as bad as the amish in the usa , but it gets close ...

  would be a lot harder with a potato down the throat , however . 
  * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouidptm3gpk ), 
  * foreigners * refers to the total amount of foreigners , while * other foreigners * refers to the origin countries not mentioned otherwise . 
  so * other foreigners * is a subclass of * foreigners * and all nationalities should add up to the amounts listed under * foreigners * ( third row ) . 
  the original excel had expandable rows , which i could not make clear with reddit formatting . 
  i do n't believe in this , that 's most probably based on older markets . 
  food is a necessity , and concerning other purchases : people have become too short-sightened for that . 
  most really want to have the latest phone every year anyway , or go with the trends in clothing . 
  now , i 've read a great article some time ago in a dutch newspaper on why a small inflation is favoured by economists . 
  it 's most in the interest of companies with big loans and the state , not really in the interest of consumers . 
  really , every 15 minutes ? 
  damn , i would be bored at the bus stop . 
  we have 14 buses p hour , for just one bus line here .

  lol , good luck with living on the gro\u00dfglockner , mate . 
  i know . 
  same comment applies . 
  does a _ swamp id _ pose different rights compared to the normal _ reisepass _ ? 
  bavaria and austria could merge , but i doubt those mountains will give the bavarians much living space . 
  but that might be related to the fact that most will already complain or sigh in some way about the journey if the train is delayed by 5 minutes . 
  job seeking probably means they have actually registered themselves at some office or agency to find work , while jobless means receiving welfare because you perhaps have been exempted from work , due to some impairment ... to be honest , i do n't know the exact subdivision . 
   cute little state . 
   ### little state ...  #little ... ... .

  * have edited this a shit ton of times . 
  a preview before submit would be great in reddit . 
   dutch/moroccans for drug smuggling . 
  lol , tell me about it . 
  we have had a sort off * drugs war * in amsterdam from 2013 - 2015 . 
  quite some liquidations in this time span , with recently even a beheading on a public road . 
  almost all of them '' '' * dutch * '' '' - moroccan . 
  though , practically , you could just call them moroccan . 
  thx for the link . 
  i guess i 've found a very effective , albeit a bit trolling , way of immediately getting the source . 
  if u/langeball had taken a look at some of comment history he would have concluded i 'm far from someone trying to find racism everywhere . 
  yes . 
  handing out the prisoners their own key . 
  it 's an idiocracy , as they tried this before in the 70s and 80s in amsterdam in the so-called * bijlmerbajes * ( unofficial name ) . 
  they reverted some rules as some just escaped the prison because of these experimental rules . 
  it has been closed now , and acts as a refugee centre . 
  just r/europe : * something with refugees * [ ^ ^ [ * citation * ^ ^ * needed * ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:citation_needed ), 
   prison is n't punishment , the loss of your freedom is . 
  yet should n't become the alternative route to getting regular therapy from a psychologist for example . 
  there should be some deterrent to jump the line for psychological help by just killing someone . 
  the norwegian prison system is focussing on lightening the restriction of freedom , by offering communication opportunities , enlarging living space , create social gatherings between inmates , etc. . . 
  it is n't a complete loss anymore , i would rather call it a restriction of freedom . 
  furthermore , i have stated that it is quite imaginable that plenty of people suffer immaterially the same , due to social isolation and usually accompanied by a restriction of freedom .
