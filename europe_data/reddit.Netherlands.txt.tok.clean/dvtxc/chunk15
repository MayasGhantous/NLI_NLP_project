  one example could be some elderly , as portrayed by the media nowadays , yet i 'm afraid the amount of people in this situation is actually rather large . 
  norway is sending inmates to the netherlands , as they do n't have enough prisons , and we 're demolishing our prisons and a quite a few of them is just empty . 
  we get some refund from their government in return . 
  [ source ( dutch ) ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2022359-noorse-gevangenen-in-september-naar-nederland.html ) , 242 norwegian prisoners have been sent to the netherlands . 
  we also host belgian prisoners and talks with the swiss government are currently being held as well . 
  that + you are probably paying rent for it . 
  want to quote one of the comments beneath the article :  i 'm sure there is something the way things are in norway that contribute to it 's prison success . 
  i 'm a little hesitant to agree that its for the reason they think . 
  norway 's prison system does n't only consist of shorter sentences but most probably comprises more guidance and rehabilitation programs of the inmate . 
  call me stubborn , but i refuse to believe that shorter sentences solely lead to a lower recidivism rate . 
  at some point , the trade-off between the rehabilitation effectiveness and the relatives ' grief is overshot . 
  just as i consider the american system to be bizarre , the norwegian prison system is still on the other far end for me . 
  in the example as mentioned in the article of breivik , the loss of your child and a luxury imprisonment does n't break even . 
  i do n't say a break even is something worth aspiring to ( as im unsure whether it is within reach at all ) , but the difference is just too extreme for me . 
  i bet there are plenty of people who suffer more during their lives and/or experience the same kind of social isolation for some time without any imprisonment or having convicted anything even in developed countries . 
  they are already living the lives these inmates live . 
  now it might be just a meme when people say * better get arrested in norway then * , but this might actually become worrisome if an ever becoming larger amount of people would actually be willing to do this , if their living standard is below , say , a norwegian prison environment . 
  head of state = / = head of executive legislature, 
  the last time i read about these guys , operating under a different name _ urgenda _ , they seemed to be some environment fanatics . 
  i ask them what their proposal actually is , instead of solely suing the government of the country that has one of the highest living standards in the world . 
  for example , replacing all cars by electric vehicles might reduce pollution near traffic arteries , it wo n't contribute significantly to the overall co2 emission in the netherlands as a majority of it is taken account of by just a handful of companies , who at the same time form the backbone of our economy . 
  the amount of tourists/capita attracted by the vatican city on the other hand will be enormous . 
  or liechtenstein, 
  the official statement from the government has been that * almost certainly * nobody from the passengers would have experienced the downing consciously and otherwise would have become unconsciously very quickly . 
  this was the official statement towards the relatives and friends of the killed passengers as well . 
  in a talk show he actually mentioned otherwise , that he had seen some of the bodies with an oxygen mask pulled on , meaning that they surely experienced everything consciously for a certain time , enabling them to pull those masks on , and their last moments must have been a horror . 
  this was told by him on public television before informing the relatives . 
  it enraged most relatives and caused a political uproar concerning his integrity as a minister . 
   i think its incredible that you seem to think getting that big of a promotion has anything to do with saving the reputation of the pvda . 
  sounds like empty populist reasoning . 
  as i said , ** i ** even supported him at that time , despite the [ shitstorm he received ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/zelfbeheersing-is-niet-de-sterkste-kant-van-frans-timmermans~a3765607/ ) , because imo he finally told the truth , even though it might have been a slip of the tongue . 
  i based this impression as he indeed was asked from various people to come with an apologise and this was one of the latest big public appearance of him in the context of the mh17 downing . 
  no , it surely was n't solely to save his * ss , as the party has already been in recession for a longer time , yet does match up with the timing and is a way to make progression in a career . 
  i think it would have gone downwards from that moment on if he stayed as minister of foreign affairs . 
  it was even overhyped in the news as if we should get some kind of national pride that he would become the * right hand of juncker * . 
  i 've literally heard any kind of superlative for his new position in brussels once this was made official . 
  not particularly the best kind of message to get across if euroscepticism is on a high in the netherlands . 
  just before he left his post of minister of foreign affairs his public reputation plummeted after some tactless outings on public television following the mh17 downing . 
  ( * side note : * by then , i actually supported this , as for a moment a politician was actually honest ) some people , yes , have had the impression he left his post after this tactlessness to save his reputation and the the reputation of the labour party . 
  so , i just read the list : ** grabs popcorn *, 
  i can give you the name of the next huge snake : * frans timmermans * . 
  once one of our renowned politicians , we disgust him since he got ambitions in brussels . 
   perhaps they should fuck off back to turkey and see how they like it before they spout such drivel . 
  considering the turkish population in germany , that would greatly compensate last year 's influx , zeroing their net migration levels . 
  plus , we will exchange backward thinking akp-voting kebab shop owners and taxi drivers for pharmacists and surgeons , ^ ^ right ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ is n't ^ ^ ^ ^ it ?

  as far as i know the bretons lost most of their language and cultural heritage due to french '' * oppression * '' in the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century . 
  the language was not allowed to be taught at school for example . 
  actually during the german occupation the breton nationalist movement gained momentum again . 
  the german occupation seems to have a double sided story according to some of the rumours . 
  yet this is something you should ask someone from brittany or a historian . 
  * edit : * i remember there 's been a documentary on this particular part of the history of the bretons on dutch television . 
  luckily we use subtitles here , so one could try to understand the french original soundtrack and the majority of the documentary features bretons interviewed in french . 
  you 'll have to skip the parts where the dutch interviewer occasionally adds his own commentary .
