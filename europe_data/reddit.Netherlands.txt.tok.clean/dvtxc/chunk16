  did you know that our flag is reversed ? 
  although , schleswig-holstein is the swamp of germany , so you are not too far of ... 
  * `` 640 kb is enough '' *, 
  because those costly green politics are always a tremendously good idea . 
  the world has stuck with the first generations of nuclear power plants , while saver nuclear energy is n't given a chance anymore , yet being much more cost effective . 
  new nuclear plant concepts do n't include the so famous blue lighted core anymore , but instead focus on small amounts of fuel , which are unable to create a chain reaction , and whose ( th ) end products have a much shorter half life than the end products of current fuel ( pu ) ,, 
  better gloat over belgium , beating them by 5 points .

  \u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8 ( arubaito ) , according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanism_ ( linguistics ) #japanese it 's a germanism , though it would n't surprise me if it has a dutch origin ( * arbeid * ) , as the dutch have been exclusive traders with japan for a long time . 
  reading further on the germanisms this made me laugh :  ... victories of the german generalfeldmarschall erwin rommel in africa were frequently celebrated , thus establishing * rommel * as the japanese term for victory or success . 
  ** geography geek side note : ** our highest point became higher in 2010 , setting the highest point from [ 312m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaalserberg ) to [ 887m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_scenery ) . 
  sorry denmark , but gunnbj\u00f8rn fjeld ( 3700m ) does n't count , as * greenland * is an autonomous state within the kingdom of denmark and * saba * belongs to the netherlands proper . 
  first i thought she was just a die-hard opportunist . 
  now i absolutely believe she is just plain stubborn . 
  some 20 wars have been fought between sweden and denmark over norway . 
  this time , things will be different ... 
  well , if you would kick out all those russian millionaires , who possess palaces in the midst of the city , sometimes even without living in them ... 
  too much of a hassle , just annexe belgium . 
  some university cities in the netherlands already were n't fun to pay the rent for a shared flat , especially * amsterdam * and * utrecht * are quite expensive cities to live in as a student . 
  paying $ 600 pm . 
  for just 14 m ^ 2 , shared kitchen and shared bathroom is n't uncommon . 
  regional differences should be considered as well . 
  there are two provinces in the netherlands where housing pricing are falling for multiple consecutive years . 
  province of * groningen * because of the natural gas winning and the associated earth quakes , some of the residents get their house subsidised on sale . 
  province of * limburg * , because especially the youth is leaving this border province . 
  demographics are declining in these regions , despite multiple attempts by the government to attract new people to this area . 
  ( first one known as the * vino * policy , already introduced in 1988 ) some ( semi - ) governmental offices and institutions were deliberately transferred to the these provinces in the hope to create some work there . 
   amato advised that brussels offer no concessions to london in upcoming negotiations , as this is the only way britain might reconsider the decision it made through referendum . 
    `` when it comes to the economy ** they have to lose ** , '' he said . 
  so , even if it turns out to be beneficial for the uk ? 
  otherwise , * we 'll show them * ? 
  not even virtual ones , but real ones . 
  free clay !, 
  because * [ virtue signalling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virtue_signalling ) * . 
  you gain social status by showing how many `` good deeds '' you perform for the world , even if it will be at your own cost . 
  it shows how individualistic many social liberals actually are . 
  i have n't read up on your source yet . 
  i do know that recently a similar kind of report was published in the netherlands by the central statistics office , saying exactly the same about immigrants and natives . 
  yet , they apparently counted all people with double citizenship as * dutch * and only those who did n't acquire dutch citizenship yet as an * immigrant * . 
  it was a clickbait report title , which was copied by a lot of newspapers , ignoring the more detailed contents of the report , in which was stated that people with immigrant background , primarily north-african countries , were hugely overrepresented in most crimes . 
  though , yes , they have a dutch passport , though that does n't make them natives . 
  i do n't know for sure , but i thought one would be send back if he commits a crime for which he can get a sentence of 3 months or higher . 
  it 's still too high imo . 
  your first months in a country that cares to take you up should be certainly a time in which you prove yourself first . 
  i do n't have any imprint of car tires over my body . 
  so , i do n't think so . 
  lol , this thread is killing me . 
  * `` der t\u00e4ter habe sich [ ... ] in die frau verliebt '' * so , it 's right to call these immigrants * testosterone bombs * , since they truly can not handle their hormones . 
  how sick does one have to be to kill a pregnant woman ? 
  actually , i 'm questioning now how they got to know this information so quickly ... 
  though on the other hand ... it 's bild . 
  better take everything with some salt before it 's confirmed . . 
  * over here * is ? 
  ( i 'm not feeling like scrolling through your post history to recover your residency ), 
  moreover : * `` germany considers banning video-games featuring knifes as melee weapons . 
  ~ ~ so he 's a refugee and his father already has a kebab shop ? 
  how high is the demand for kebab shops in germany ?? 
  i thought it was pretty saturated by now , with kebab/d \u00f6nner / shoarma at almost every street corner in the cities ... ~ ~ edit : ah , that 's clear now . 
  well lying would be intentionally . 
  hm i have to correct i think . 
  this is how i remembered it , because of the victimisation of the robbers . 
  i just looked it up , she was suspected of killing instead , yet the relatives of the robbers demanded a case . 
  a jeweler once shot armed robbers in the netherlands which were in a fight with the husband of the jeweler ( thus risking to shoot her husband ) , and it took * a long * case before the jeweler was exempted from sentence it 's the best example of * nothilfe * i can give . 
  so yes , exempted from sentence , but it was a really long case which had a lot of media coverage ... 
  baffled by the way he did it . 
  he surely is a hero imo who could have saved a lot of lives . 
  yet , with current judges this guy risks being sentenced as it 's not personal defence in a strict sense , i 'm afraid . 
  or at least for sure would be over here . 
  not even mentioning the overkill . 
  i like this map for some reason . 
  double border = dmz between canada and the usa ? 
   however , the incident in munich and w\u00fcrzburg would not be covered by this . 
  what would be a criterium ? 
  i understand the difference in scale of the situations , yet for example in the munich attack , the amount of messages ( including false alarms ) would have been enough to get the impression of a similar situation ( hostage situation at the airport , second shooting in the city centre , etc. ) . 
  luckily they turned out to be false . . 
  though this information has been unclear for quite some time , while the use of military should be decided within this time frame to be effective i guess ... ( apart from using military to * maintain * safety )  as ultima ratio in an extraordinary situations quite off-topic , but i 've seen how important it can be nowadays to include this phrase in copies of an interview . 
  referring to the so-called * `` schie\u00dfbefehl '' * in the refugee debate . 
  just look at the polls in the netherlands : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/next_dutch_general_election#opinion_polls, 
  i suppose i feel your pain bro . 
  i have had it for 6 years , but i have lost most of it . 
  yes i heard that story already . 
  ok , but at least the impression somehow exists . 
  nope , not really . 
  apart from the loads of drunk british tourists on king 's day in amsterdam , the palaces do n't attract that much tourists , as it is not common to get a glimpse from te interiors . 
  most of the palaces can only be seen from a distance , apart from one palace in the centre of amsterdam , which , in my opinion , is n't even that noteworthy to see from close-by from the outside . 
  actually , tourists even pee on its outer walls . 
  automatic * `` spotlights of shame '' * have been installed in an attempt to reduce the acid damage to the stone . 
  i always though this was a public secret . 
  at least with a few searches you will find out that huge black markets at least exist in brussels and antwerp . 
  i 'm not sure about germany , though poland is a source for weapons as well . 
  though , interesting to note : breivik tried to acquire a gun illegally first , but he found it too troublesome , so instead he acquired it legally in norway . 
  i just always imagine them being drunk : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nal9oygyxog, 
  yet i ask myself for how long we will still be a monarchy , as the republican 's support grows stronger . 
  most students of my age state that they do n't see any additional value of the royals , or at least the monarchy in its current form . 
  i somehow tend to be neutral on this . 
  i do understand the monarchy requires extra tax money , though this government type has become rare in the world and it can be a nice tradition . 
  one of our biggest national holiday is related to our royals , though more and more only associate it with the festivals held on that day now . 
  we all remember : https://youtu.be/vnwseqkkyie, 
  and then they call us * swamp germans * ... we at least have turned those swamps into something useful . 
  i think she 's even going for another term .
