  ^ now ^ someone ^ help ^ me ^ to ^ get ^ the ^ dativus ^ * auctoris * ^ right . 
  these * terrorism experts * on dutch television following the attacks in paris have always baffled me . 
  during the live coverage on the news , they truly sum up every possibility from ` misunderstood person ' to ` unlucky childhood ' , sometimes even heading straight to attacking european security services . 
  only the day after the bitter reality - * i do n't state it applies to yesterday 's attack * - of islamist terror gets mentioned . 
  if no new footage comes in , they fill the broadcast with utter obvious statements ... 
  yet , my irritation of terrorism experts is nothing compared to * mourning experts * . 
  :| yes , they exist . 
  and we have n't seen anything else on television following the mh-17 downing . 
  changed , 
  nevertheless , the filmer was called * irresponsible * during an interview with a terrorism expert on the ard yesterday evening , as he could even have escalated the situation further . 
  but yes , amazing it is . 
  disclaimer : i do n't state i share the opinion of this * expert * . 
  now it 's gone . 
  somehow lost connection when i hit the * save * button . 
  seems to be highly likely . 
  he was running on the back of the crowd , so sadly has been the easiest target . 
  furthermore , saturn ( seen on the photo ) and mcdonalds are on the same street , so location is identical . 
  we truly see his last seconds ... :( ( i 'm actually thinking of removing that photo again ... the point is , the host wont . 
  i give the time when this was reported . 
  most probably they have been flown in earlier , though this does n't mean all new sources are up-to-date , especially concerning police actions which are kept confidential where possible . 
  it has been removed . 
  i will double check new footage as far as i can . 
  done . 
  appears to be from johannesburg . 
  yes , i just got that as well . 
  as said by the fire department somehow ... 
  just after the ard mentioned [ the number of declining terror attacks on the tagesschau ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/5571gl6qo6-wlrzijeihv5i786qkvvpumakdihhnaem.png?w=837&amp;s=8e846d299f7e48e563fdf88b0d62aac0 ) ...

  well just generally speaking , it 's not only welfare . 
  i think they truly do realise that living conditions are better over here , when it comes to health , security , etc. 
  though they do not express this in their nationalism . 
  they reap everything that comes along in a welfare state , yet hail their far-away dictator and vote for the parties that offer immigrants the most benefits . 
   because they are stupid . 
  good story , bro . 
  much brevity . 
  every time i dream about political aspirations , i wake up when i realise it means i will have to give up a normal social life . 
  hm ... now i should choose between this or having the * stupid * parties ruling ... 
  and you know what ? 
  turks are often considered here as the better integrated and hard working immigrants when compared to moroccans or algerians , who are truly just lurking the society . 
  though their political views are actually sometimes worrisome . 
  and their political aspirations are not limited to turkish elections anymore , as we have a truly turkish political party now , which sole existence is based on giving more profits to people with immigrant background . 
  ( it actually is a single issue party . ), 
  the more children you have ... 
  turks ? 
  you mean those who run the shoarma/d \u00f6ner rooms here or shady driving schools ? 
  really interesting and at the same time terrifying is , the few highly educated turks i know here strongly support erdogan . 
  almost at a level they would rather move to turkey to express their support , though i think they are held here by the amount of welfare they receive here . 
   one of the afd twittered that she would shoot kids trespassing the border , and so on . 
  can you give me the exact incident . 
  are you referring to the interview with frauke petry , in which she just referred to an actual article in german law , that states that borders should be protected with force in case of emergency as a last resort ? 
  which exists in almost every country , otherwise the very meaning of a border is questionable . 
   compared to them , the incidents the greens had ( drug abuse or illusional world view ) are far less worrying . 
  let me give you one of the weirdest outing of * groenlinks * here , they actually meant seriously and still have in their party programme : they want to fully abolish any registration of sex upon the birth of a baby and even the nationality and introduce a new type of * ` gender ' * : `` world citizen '' . 
  [ source : nrc 17/06/2015 ( dutch ) ] ( http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/06/17/groen-links-sekse-baby-niet-registreren-bij-aangifte-a1415438 ) i actually regard this illusional world view quite worrying . 
  at least from a medical perspective . 
  an example : medicines tend to have way more side effects when taken by women , because the actual pharmacology of medicines in women are far less known , as they are primarily tested on men . 
  completely ignoring the biological differences because of their sickened idealism is something i can absolutely not wrap my head around . 
  they were even outraged because race is registered upon donation of organs , since physicians see far more complications when organs are transferred interracially than when organs are transplanted intraracially . 
  [ source : trouw 21/07/2016 ( dutch ) ] ( http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4516/gezondheid/article/detail/4343802/2016/07/21/bij-orgaandonatie-zoekt-soort-naar-soort.dhtml )  they think everyone can afford that 6 $ bio organic bread and are baffled if someone tells them that they ca n't just buy a new ecology friendly car . 
  i am always baffled that these people apparently are able to afford it . 
  and ** usually ** it 's not the white collar workers or entrepreneurs who end up voting the greens . 
  now , i 'm not someone who buys at lidl or aldi instead , but i 've never even tried to buy a bio-organic version of every product either . 
  let alone i am able to afford a tesla . 
  oh , and do n't let them know about how the batteries are produced or where the rare-earth minerals for the shitload of electronics in recent cars come from , since they will want to ban all cars then instead . 
  or magnets in the vast amount of wind mills that 's needed to power just one village ... oh well ... 
  well , to me they seem to be recurring isolated incidents always coming from the green side . 
  / s although containing a few solid stances in their party programme , quite a few outings by mps of the dutch green party ( * groenlinks * ) have been downright stupid as well . 
  for me enough to loose faith in any collective intelligence of that party here . 
  i am sometimes truly baffled by the mindset of some greens . 
  it does remind me of some comments here on reddit on the political situation in austria . 
  the presidential elections were a matter of choosing the least worst option . 
  people maybe did n't want the right-wing but wanted anything but the greens as well . 
  greens are .
