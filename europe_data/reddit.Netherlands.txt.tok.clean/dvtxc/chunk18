  #w\u00fcrzburg @sz * tragical and we hope for the wounded . 
  why could n't they just wound and rendering the attacker unable to fight ????? 
  questions !, 
  #w\u00fcrzburg @sz * just mere hours after the attack .

   they vote for those who campaign on representing their interests . 
  this . 
  turks vote the labour party here ( mockingly called the * party of the immigrants * here as it has the same abbreviation ) , but massively support erdogan in turkish elections . 
  long prison sentences are too costly for these countries . 
  extort him for his money as a fine and send him back , which is completely legal , since morocco does n't allow emigrated citizens to give up their nationality and thus this guy will not be rendered stateless if he gets deported out of france . 
  this is also a reason why i do n't understand the ignorance of so many right wing parties at this moment for forbidding dual citizenship as they can use it to their benefit . 
   and if you think this is nothing , people have found chunks of microphone recordings and webcam recordings in the `` telemetry '' being sent to microsoft . 
  do you have some sources of this ? 
  sorry it 's in german , but this is what comes to my mind : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhplgajiomo ( ** ekelhafte vegetarier ** ), 
   thirdly , the drug dealers are foreign criminals and there should be deported . 
  some solutions are so plain simple . 
  it makes you wonder why we always choose the most complicated and least effective one . 
  just because * deportation * and * germany * haven proven to be an unlucky combination in the past ? 
  ** its * edit : i see , i 'm already moving to r/grammarnazis, 
  i think the default national flag overlay on facebook photos will become a little bit monotonous then . 
  zuckerberg better already starts building in all municipal flags or at least bundesland flags in the webcode then . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  recurrent repeating iterative ceaseless continual isochronal non-islamic peaceful misunderstood isolated incidents . 
  * ... by frustrated lone wolves that did n't receive help in time . 
  ah , i only thought something like this existed in the netherlands . 
  although our pm is maybe more merkels bitch . 
  you see , our pm is single , and most probably proudly calls his mom everytime he sits at the same table with merkel . 
  can you imagine his proudness if he gets the chance to sit ** next to her ** ? 
  i 'm starting this wintersemester in germany , ( _ partially _ ) because of the fees . 
  so the logic is that they government still pays for students . 
  a student pays $ 2000 ( which is set by law every year ) and the other part is paid by the government to cover the costs for the university . 
  if a student continues studying , according to their logic , the government does n't get anything in return as he does n't enter the job market . 
  several measures have been introduced during the last years to speed up the studying process . 
  although i have to say with success : a student has to get 45/60 ects in his first year ( 60/60 for medicine ) , otherwise he 's not allowed to do that particular study anymore for the next 5 years . 
  a student only receives grants/loans for his first 4 years of his bachelor . 
  ( although i 'm not really sure of this rule and our grant system has been abolished partially as well 2 years ago due to budget cuts ) a student has to receive * any * degree within 10 years , otherwise he will have to pay back everything received from the government . 
  these measures have been enforced to reduce the amount of so-called * eternal students * . 
  the average studying length actually has been decreased drastically in the past years , yet - indeed - limits the possibilities for extra wishes for broadening etc. . 
  if you want to do a second study on the same level . 
  so for example , if you already finished your first bachelor/masters study and you want to broaden yourself or go into another direction , you will have to pay a higher price . 
  it varies among the universities . 
  ( ranging somewhere between $ 10000 and $ 20000 ) i know there 's recently been made an exception for educational studies since there 's an enormous shortage of teachers . 
  educational studies are always a masters degree here . 
  if you 've completed an engineering degree ( including masters degree ) , you are still entitled to do an masters study for the regular price ( $ 2000 p.yr . ), 
  to obtain a teacher 's degree . 
  i thought it is still possible to pay these fees as a loan , right ? 
  paying will be dependent on income . 
  here it is $ 2000 for your first study , $ 15000 for second study or if you 're from outside eu/eea . 
  extra fees apply if * you study longer than you should * . 
  i think we are , after the uk , quite an expensive country to study in europe as well . 
  neighbours , slow down a bit , shall we ? 
  you still remain a ~ ~ semi - ~ ~ autonomous little brother in the south with some bilingual difficulties . 
  furthermore , the last time belgium became imperialistic , entire congo was basically turned into a shitpile . 
  does that include native demographic replacement rate ? 
  nice try alexander . 
  nope , primarily balkan mentality . 
  u/abaddon64 just gave the perfect explanation of all people i know from former yugoslavia . 
  i am already bidding on [ ceausescu 's palace ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=ceausescu+palace&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=755&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjr-orgloloahvfubqkhzrkaa8q_auibigb#imgrc=_ ) . 
  yes , yesterday i read about it : http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/renate-kuenasts-tweet-ueber-den-zug-attentaeter-von-wuerzburg-14347745.html, 
  quarantines !, 
  that 's something i have n't been thinking about before . 
  what if we consider radical islam as a sickness of the mind ? 
  it might be contagious , as we have seen . 
  / partially seriously/sarcastic, 
  ah , that 's where they needed the $ 3 billion for . 
   i feel bad for the kid . 
  doomed from the start by being born in a shithole with a shit culture . 
  does n't excuse his actions , but still . 
  these reactions are truly sickening me . 
  so many people on this world are born in shitholes , it will make you almost feel sick of realising how much shit there is out there . 
  living in eastern europe under communist regime , living under the rule of franco , living under the rule of the junta . 
  or people i know that fled the war in yugoslavia . 
  these people seem to have been raised quite normally eventually , do n't you think ? 
  or at least did n't become frustrated murders . 
  yet , muslims somehow , albeit some of them , manage to radicalise regardless of the situation they were raised in . 
  some is fighters have got university degrees in engineering , have been raised in the best welfare states of the world , and yet you think that this maniatic behaviour only arises from being born in a shithole ? 
  i have ** zero ** empathy with idiots who want to plant an axe in someone 's forehead . 
  and i truly have even less empathy with people who lie about their age or background to travel thousands of kilometres to receive welfare support and still attack citizens of the country that helps them . 
  lol , dutch mep of the greens , judith sargentini , repeated on all social media channels that radicalised travellers among the immigrants would be _ hysteria _ and _ something that the right just had made up _ . 
  https://twitter.com/judithineuropa/status/600276891883417600?s=09 greens ... 
  do n't worry . 
  i live in the south , where we do n't have that sound . 
  it 's something for the people in the upper half of the country . 
  unfortunately , this has been made * standard dutch * as heard primarily on television etc. . 
  though , you have to say , it makes speaking spanish and pronouncing their `` j '' so much easier . 
  brace yourself . 
  you 're only reading it . 
  not hearing ... ... 
  half germany still supports nazism . 
  or something like that . 
  u/bond _ ionic_bond will most probably have the original in his inbox . 
  unfortunately , the waybackmachine and google have n't cached his comment as it was below displaying threshold by the moment of chaching already . 
  well i did , two , but both were on an erasmus exchange . 
  ahh , i have always found those people in bavar * ia * suspicious . 
  now i understand why . 
  yes , just like i do , in front of the mirror , every morning . 
  did you know it 's also really effective in stopping cars when hitch-hiking ? 
  south-tyrol was a blessing . 
  once quickly needed some medicine in a pharmacy ( merano if i remember correctly ) , thank god i could speak german to the pharmacists . 
  a few tens of kilometers more southwards and i would have been fucked .
