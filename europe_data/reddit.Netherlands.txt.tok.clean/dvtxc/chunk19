  although . . wait , had the same situation in sicily . 
  nobody spoke english , though the more educated italians however did speak some baguette language . 
  so with the few words of the baguette language i know , i got the right thing over there . 
  though again , german and/or english would have been so much easier . 
   if they like turkey so much , why do n't they move to turkey if dictatorship is supposed to be better . 
  it is also very disrespectful and insulting to pay homage to an oppressor , while they themselves have benefited tremendously from a secular and democratic country . 
  just to give you an idea . 
  turkish-dutch showed the most loyalty to the ak-party of all turkish people living abroad during last elections . 
  the amount of turkish that voted in favour of erdogan was even higher than on the mainland itself . 
  '' _ league of nations 2.0 . 
  a union in name , but everyone actually was doing their own thing anyway or left when a country felt so . _ '', 
  '' _ yes my children , that 's how it went during granddad 's time . 
  unbelievable , is n't it ? _ '', 
  wait until turkey is considered not a safe country anymore where refugees can be sent back to . 
  millions in turkey will be waiting + you wo n't see those 3 billion euro anymore anyways . 
  one should measure the length of the beard as well . 
  that 's just utter nonsense . 
  family dramas including homicide and suicide for example always reach the 8 o'clock news . 
  if some maniac stabs random people i bet it will be main news for that day and perhaps the day after . 
  now , what * has been burried * instead are crimes committed by `` so-called '' dutch , such as theft , etc. 
  since , that happens on a daily basis , and we have a separate programma for this , something like * aktenzeichen xy ungel\u00f6st * . 
  just something off-topic : over here , it 's always an interesting programme if you want to learn new politically correct descriptive terms of people 's characteristics . 
  do some other parties take over , albeit in a far lesser extent , some of the stances from the afd following their electoral success in for example sachsen-anhalt and baden-w\u00fcrtemberg ? 
  -- from what i 've read , current parties in germany distantiated themselves even further , once again underlying that the afd should not be the answer . 
  though , if i look at how the success of the pvv is handled over here , something on the ** contrary ** happens . 
  according to the polls , they would get around 23 % of the votes , if an election was to be held now , making them the largest party ( compared to just 10 % for the afd ) since we will have elections in the spring of 2017 , some parties have started to use the same rethorics as the anti-islam party pvv . 
  * our socialist party ** sp ** ( perhaps comparable to * die linke * although i 'm not sure ) : https://twitter.com/paululenbelt/status/755110248566943744 ( effectively saying that all turks who support erdogan should leave our country , even with force if needed ) * current leading party ** vvd ** ( comparable to the * fdp * in germany ) has been subject to some small uproar as some mps ( though no members that are in the government ) have approved racial profiling on public television and hardened their words concerning muslim immigration in the last months . 
  ( source : https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/88877929/zijlstra.mp4 ) it 's almost as they start to fight over the same electorate . 
  * sorry for all sources being dutch , i do n't really have time at this moment to provide translations . 
  * -- ** edit : ** i just read something interesting , that is actually related to my question : http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/renate-kuenasts-tweet-ueber-den-zug-attentaeter-von-wuerzburg-14347745.html, 
  ban all the trucks !, 
  is n't this how all journalism concerning economics is done ? 
  for example , i 've always found articles about second derivates just plain stupid . 
  '' * growth of profit of company x slows down . 
  * '' o_o, 
  actually it really shows the underlying tension among the french . 
  now everyone * thought * this , said it by figure of speech , but now people actually * do * this , in public . 
  to keep it by figure of speech , i think it 's boiling in france , in a pressure cooker . 
  it must be the side-effects of bleach . 
  so portugal has always seemed to be an eastern european country on these maps , when it came to purchasing power and mean income , yet a relatively large amount of portugese reside within luxemburg , one of the richest countries . 
  they had , right ? 
  a large one in stuttgart on april the 30th if i remember correctly . 
  although i actually remember this because 400 demonstrators were arrested that day . 
  no , but i just based my opinion on interviews with frauke petry on public television , which in my opinion at least was able to answer questions with decent argumentation , despite almost booed at by the public . 
  yes , infights have occurred over here as well . 
  some left the party ( pvv ) and started their own fractions . 
  since we absolutely do n't have any threshold ( like the 5 % threshold in the bundestag ) we have a terribly partitioned parliament in the house of representatives currently . 
  ** fractions ) and the pvv lacks any structure , since , well . . it 's lead by just one person . 
  or at least , that 's the impression i have . 
  most people actually refer to the leader of the party , instead of the party itself . 
  is n't pegida more affiliated to parties like the npd ? 
  actually , i think it could work out good if these movements start their own party . 
  if handled right , it gives the afd something to distantiate from and to prove that they could be a responsible choice on the right side . 
  i keep saying that our anti-immigration party in the netherlands is just a far cry in terms of * responsibleness * compared to the afd . 
  this might seem to be unthinkable to most germans perhaps , but you can be blessed the afd at least hosts party conferences , has someone with a university degree at the top and actively tries to get rid of extremist maniacs in the party . 
  the afd * had * ( i do n't know whether they are still there ) a lot of economists in the party in the times they concerned a bout the greek financial crisis . 
  is starts to do it low-budget , as it seems ... \\ s, 
  now i 'm really interested in a source of the second statement . 
  almost any german i met has a fear of nazism . 
  you could harshly say they get anti-nazi ~ ~ indoctrination ~ ~ lessons at school , as they have separate lessons beside history to cover this part of their history and how to * deal * with it now . 
  maybe you have met some npd members in saxony , and consider them to be representative to the german population . 
  so , just the american way of security ? 
  there are bad guys with guns ? 
  let 's give everyone a gun . 
  * disclaimer : i 'm actually fairly neutral on this *, 
  so , every country that 's not in the nato is immediately prone to an invasion by russia ? 
  i have n't seen any russian flags in austria nor finland . 
  the red scare has returned apparently . 
  i just did on your other comment , concerning altruism . 
  i disagreed as well , as i consider altruism to be lunacy . 
  i think you do n't understand the role of sub threads either ... 
  * that 's called ** altruism ** . 
  you are referring to just the common sense of helping others , usually carried out in a way that does not damage the person self . 
  sch\u00e4uble actually states we should forget our own growth for the sake of countries who mess up every time because of no other reason but themselves . 
  could we at least agree that the order of magnitude of germany 's population is much higher than all numbers listed in this thread so far , as in 8 * 10 ^ 7   10 ^ 4   160 ? 
   i do n't get the mixed reactions to this . 
  is n't this a good idea ? 
  that the countries that are better off , help the ones that are not so well off . 
  i think you mess-up the common sense of helping others and altruism . 
  anthropologists even think that a population size of ** 160 ** still is enough for a _ minimum viable population _ , given that relations will be truly random . 
  being involved in war crimes ? 
  i admire your creativity for this post . 
  forgetting that these two years are just enough to even intensify their jihadist thoughts . 
  the taxpayer is furthermore paying to keep these inmates alive , and give them the perfect environment for further radicalization . 
  exclusion from society , or black listing these people for re-entry in europe would be much more effective . 
  nevertheless , can turkey be excluded from article 5 ? 
  that risky behaviour with russia is not something you would like to see with such a maniac as a head of state . 
  they should add a mixed content type post . 
  link + text submission . 
  i know that kojunktiv i is reported speech , but there is no good equivalent in english to indicate reported speech , therefore i used the subjunctive in english to give at least some distinction from actual facts . 
  it 's one of those little grammatical features of the german language i admire , and really would make a great contribution in other languages . 
  i will incorporate your other suggestions . 
  thank you very much . 
  well , at least they have n't started talking about expansion , yet ... \\ s, 
  let 's say i 've got different personal experiences . 
  and i 'm in a city centre on a daily basis , so i do n't rant from a farm village . 
  or r/nottheonion, 
  it remains a bit unclear to me as well . 
  i translated is as _ proposal _ , but he could mean the _ common stance _ as well . 
  it 's these subtle contextual meanings i would like to get reviewed by a native german .
