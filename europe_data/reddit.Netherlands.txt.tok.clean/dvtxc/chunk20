  now i know that a sort of anti-inbred app exists in iceland , yet sch\u00e4uble thinks that a polulation of 81 million is not enough to maintain natural diversity . 
  \\ s * ( and if still not sufficient for him , there are ~ 800 million other people with more or less compatible cultural background ) *, 
   well i do n't think sch\u00e4uble speaks for the netherlands . 
  yet . 
    and it 's clear in the article that he talks about germany . 
  yet . 
  we 're talking about a very influential person in the eu as well . 
  besides , our pm just copies everything he hears either from the east or from the south ( brussels ) . 
  edit : please make notice of edits . 
  yes , i know , he 's mentioning both delimited by ** and ** . 
  i think it 's a slippery slope , as when you allow to discriminate between women and men to fulfil some kind of distribution among your workforce , it can be extended towards affirmative actions for non-native employees as well . 
  ** affirmative action ** exists over here , primarily with women though . 
  it * will * be made into a policy , * if * companies wo n't attract women before some year . 
  let me find the source . 
  edit : found . 
  http://nos.nl/artikel/2080682-kabinet-verlengt-streeftermijn-topvrouwen.html so , if top companies wo n't have enough women employed at the highest functions before 2020 , a nationwide quota will be enforced by the government . 
  edit2 : quota for immigrant labour force have been discussed since 1990 : http://www.volkskrant.nl/economie/quotum-allochtonen-werkt-niet~a715307/ http://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/politiek/10306366/denk-pleit-voor-allochtonenquotum currently , a political fraction with 2 seats in the house of representatives actually favours one . 
  sorry for all sources being dutch . 
  i 'll give you another thing to blame these stances and politicians for : _ soft racism of low expectations _ . 
  these politicians think these countries can absolutely not stand on their own . 
  actually , we are making them once again in our history dependent on us . 
  it 's not even true globalisation . 
  they ca n't help that they have other values concerning women in society . 
  they ca n't help that their economy is not on par with ours . 
  so , * we * should help them ? 
  we should actually stop being a maternal figure for the rest of the world , as perhaps merkel would like to see herself . 
  for a lot of countries , one should understand , their disadvantage is caused by nobody but themselves . 
  internal conflicts have hindered the development of so many countries in the sub-saharan region and now again in the middle east . 
  the economists apparently just want to recolonise these countries again , but now calling it a _ humanitarian act _ . 
  the argument about _ inbred _ is just disgusting , if you ask me . 
  it 's slowly taking the shape of government controlled breeding programme . 
  _ `` if you ca n't fight it , assimilate with it . 
  '' _ in it 's most literal sense of the word .

  ** --  ** seclusion will lead us to inbred **   the minister of finance opposes a seclusion . 
  muslims are an enrichment for germany . 
  especially turkish woman possess an `` enormous innovative potential '' . 
    the minister of finance wolfgang sch\u00e4uble asks for a fundamental change in dealing with the arabic world and africa . 
  `` africa will be our problem , and it is our task to this on us '' , as said by sch\u00e4uble in `` die zeit '' , which will be published on thursday . 
  `` we started after 1990 to take this task seriously , that indeed more exists than the western world . 
  to say it harshly , the middle east has kept africa out of our hairs . 
  this is over now . '', 
    facing the migration from crisis zones of the middle east and africa : `` one thing is clear about the future : we will have to invest more in iraq , in syria and in libya und after that we will have to pay more for the development of the sub-saharan countries . 
  then we can finaly open up the market . 
  the north africans expect this from us , in return for keeping the immigrants back . 
  it 's their respectfull right , is n't it ? '', 
    sch\u00e4uble further dismisses one of the proposals , in which europe should inhibit further immigration : `` this seclusion is exactly what will destroy us and which will lead to inbred . 
  muslims in germany are for us an enrichment for our openness and diversity . 
  look at the third generation turks , and especially the women !, 
  those possess an enormous innovative potential ! '', 
    ** sch\u00e4uble is worried about the condition of the american democracy . 
  **   the rich countries should make more effort to compensate the disadvantaged countries . 
  `` the task of the globalised world will be , another revolution , a fundamental change without exaggeration '' , according to sch\u00e4uble . 
    ###### alternative translation : _ `` the task of the globalised world will be to create a revolution of moderation , a fundamental change towards no exaggeration '' _   he was humored at the g7 by colleagues , when he said : `` actually we do n't need to grow that much anymore . 
  we should help to grow the southern economies faster . 
  it rubs some of them the wrong way , when i say this . '', 
    sch\u00e4uble is worried about the condition of american democracy , which `` in the eyes of a non-western person [ ... ] is becoming more of a plutocracy of big capital '' . 
    `` even the americans will have to learn to look at the world from a different persepective and not only their own . 
  for example , why have n't they properly succeeded to make latin america a good partner ? '', 
  ah , the houses of ~ ~ god ~ ~ saatana . 
  brutalism needs wood as well right , afaik ? 
  wood + unfinished concrete + glass , it can look nice . 
  from what i 've experienced so far , central europe has the best climate for me . 
  ( continental europe with at least 300 km from the shore ) . 
  real summer , real winter , more variation in seasons . 
  just make sure you 're not in the midst of a valley , so you 're safe in case of a river flooding . 
  bavaria , bohemia , austria , just this entire upper danube region : i 'm jealous . 
   i 'm sure it 's gon na be wholly different this time , though . 
  please tell me , you said that what a bucket load of sarcasm . 
  third generation moroccans still ca n't get our simplistic grammar right . 
  you want to have dutch weather ? 
  it has nothing , not a real summer , not a real winter . 
  and add a lot of rain . 
  in reality no country would want to lose a single penny , because of a stubborn stance towards the uk . 
  if a country does not offer a free trade agreement , because they think they will have to _ punish _ the uk , someone else will offer one . 
  some quotes by european head of states following the brexit were just cringeworthy . 
  they _ had _ to prove that a brexit would have immediate negative consequences , one way or another . 
  true , as someone from the 90s , these coups seem to be from something in the past i 've only read about . 
  good to see we got flanders . 
  but why would merkelreich ever want to incorporate wallonia ? 
  let us have that as industrial colonised semi-independent territory , plox . 
  ask norway, 
  it 's always time for reichzeit , is n't it ? 
  a eu map with greenland on it is . 
  oh gosh , learning polish must be ... challenging . 
  just those consonant combinations ... 0 . o here is some good starting point https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdkvoq9znwo , 
  it already has passed the point of rehabilitation since so many tend to make the same mistakes once released from custody . 
  one of the foremost important reason to sentence someone to imprisonment is to take away a potentially harmful person from society . 
  sentenced persons only do rehabilitate if they have any sense of regret or feeling how society should work . 
  this sense will be present if the community looks down on perpetrators . 
  it does not if your connections actually pay more respect to those who got in conflict with the authorities . 
  such ** does ** exist among these perpetrators in k\u00f6ln and most probably among a lot of other islamic minorities . 
  ( disobedience to _ kuff\u0101r _ ) if judges fail to acknowledge this , they will not see that these joke sentences wo n't have any effect and rehabilitation wo n't take place . 
  furthermore , i completely agree it feels enraging , almost humiliating for the victims , to see these sentences . 
  well , it 's the same sentence as a guy got for roadkilling a family while driving drunk this year here . 
  ( i thought it was even 40 hours ) it 's like judges have become the softest beings in western countries . 
  any offence after which you do not show up to the police yourself out of regret should already be punished with more than a community service . 
  so , the other algerian only got a suspended sentence : with other words , just walks right out the court building .
