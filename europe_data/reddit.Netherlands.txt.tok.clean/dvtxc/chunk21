  now i am also interested in the news articles i 've heard in which they stated that a significant part of them was residing illegally in germany in the first place . 
  true , but furthermore the difference in media coverage is frustrating as well . 
  words are carefully selected : http://nos.nl/artikel/2116823-123-agenten-gewond-geraakt-bij-krakersrellen-berlijn.html ( dutch news broadcasting corporation from the public broadcaster ) only mentions * squatters * , while squatters quite often have ties with anarchist and far-left groups . 
  even funier , they link to the original article , from die welt , where it seems to be a translation from , though they carefully removed the word * eine linke gewaltorgie * . 
  but yes , it 's absurd to me how a 1:2 police force still has difficulties to control the crowd . 
  something is wrong in their tactics and handling of the crowd . 
  i 'm not defending the pegida demonstrations we have as well over here in the netherlands , but there it is usually a few hundreds -- if not more -- police officers against just a handful of right wing protesters . 
  poland stronk . 
  poland can not into space , but poland can into runnings . 
  registration in order to vote , what 's this madness ? 
  would _ tysk _ ( from scandinavian languages ) fit in the same category as _ duits _ and _ deutsch _ ? 
  ** 60 % of the registered voters * source was the guardian . 
  actually , i consider the vocabulary of the english language rather small compared to that of other languages . 
  i tend to have more difficulties finding synonyms in english when writing a report to prevent repetitiveness compared to when writing in dutch , though that might be related to the fact that english is not my first language . 
  but see my post here https://m.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4rzqbl/german_politician_english_should_lose_dominance/d55o7s4 oh and only we and germans can truly stitch words together . 
  i 've been raised bilingually , learned three additional foreign languages at school ( as mandatory in the netherlands ) and had latin as well . 
  sorry , but just in my own opinion , i do n't consider the english language to be the most interesting of them , even though it has almost become the language i 'm the most fluent in , since i use it so often . 
  some language groups in the indo-european language family have so much more interesting ways of formulating sentences due to , albeit complicated , yet beautiful grammar rules , creating interesting nuances . 
  i can differentiate facts from things i heard from others by just altering one ending of the verb in german . 
  the completeness of an action can be described by just the verb type in slavic languages . 
  dutch , my native language , is subject to heavy influence from english . 
  in just a century , we dropped our germanic cases , most of the differentiation in gender , and a part our vocabulary in spite of anglicisms . 
  the youth usually create phrases half consisting of english words , whose dutch equivalent they would n't be able to mention anymore . 
  call me old-fashioned , but i doubt whether it 's a nice development . 
  i think the germans should be prepared to fight the baguette language then ... funnily though : most signs in the bit older trains in the netherlands have always been displayed in four languages : dutch , english , german and french , sometimes even skipping the english translation . 
  just because english has n't always had the preferred status of lingua franca * per se * . 
  though i do n't think the influence of english will be smaller after the brexit from the eu , as after all : the english influence did n't come from britain , but mostly from american influence . 
  most people are raised with american television or anything derived from that . 
  now they might * de juro * try to change it , starting out by translating legislative documents etc. . , though even that will be difficult . 
  * sidenote : * i 'm actually not even against changing the language , as i do n't really favour the english language . 
  a pretty dull language imho , but it 's near impossible . 
  i 've 3d-printed one , but it 's not on the list . . :(, 
  i think i 've had enough internet for today . 
  now , the real question is , how much do i risk my ~ ~ life ~ ~ * social exclusion * if i forward this to any german friend ? 
  ** axe *, 
  ** germany : ** a love-hate relationship . 
  the first thing you might hear is some joke about 70 years ago , but after that , one will notice we secretly like them and could n't exist without our big neighbours . 
  not everyone expresses it at first sight , but trust me , we do . 
  * sidenote : does n't apply to football . 
  better not be white/black dressed during a match . 
  just do n't * ** belgium : ** that funny speaking neighbour with even weirder speaking people in the south . 
  though flemish actually get our grammar right . 
  flanders , u wan na join again ? 
   * geography geek side note : we share a border with france on the island of st. martin * ** france : ** hon hon hon , germany is a much better holiday resort than you . 
  though not everyone has realised that yet , ( maybe luckily ), 
  as in the eagles of death metal who where removed from several line-ups after their interview on le bataclan shootings ? 
  look , i talk from a dutch perspective . 
  many people regard the netherlands as a kind of sweden light . 
  not quite there yet , but we 're doing our job . 
  guest workers from turkey , morocco , italy and spain ( people always forget that we 've imported loads of them as well ) were ** not ** the troublemakers in the 60s and 70s . 
  the offspring of primarily the muslim guests are . 
  and their offspring seems to become even worse , with a complete disobedience of any authority and social norms . 
  now you probably have seen the soaring amount of commited crimes , groping and intimidation by islamic immigrants from the past years . 
  i honestly can not imagine how their offspring will be then . 
  raised in islamic enclaves in cities such as malm\u00f6 , g\u00f6teborg and for us rotterdam . 
  there are neighbourhoods which seem to be cut off from the rest of the society , where the main language is arabic and yes , where the predominant social norms of the arabic countries is being taught . 
  hence , the misogyny we see at festivals such as in g\u00f6teborg . 
  i know reading is hard for most people . 
  i explicitly said _ people with immigration background _ . 
  did you know these so-called _ second or third generation immigrants _ are usually even worse ? 
  at least they are here . 
  ** edit : ** now apparently i had the numbers for malm\u00f6 in my head , which according to http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/ are correct . 
  though for g\u00f6teborg it is 65/35 . 
  now excuse me while i eat my hat because of my geographical mess-up . 
  hatar hatar hatar . 
  * * holy shit for you guys to get girls feel insecure when they go to a festival . 
  i hate guys . 
  hate hate hate . 
  * i just hope her expressions are not the general public opinion in sweden . 
  otherwise , that country is lost for good ... 
  last time i read g\u00f6teborg has a 50/50 population of ethnic swedes and people with immigration background . 
  crimes are in western countries primarily commited by people with immigration background . 
  there you already have the majority , if you can do simple math . 
  i propose a fine of # 8000 just as in switzerland , though applying to women who ** do n't ** wear a burka . 
  sweden is the forever ongoing meme . 
  which does n't happen . 
  * suspects * are released after a few hours , especially considering the police in most western countries such as sweden and or the netherlands . 
  now , quite a few have been sentenced in k\u00f6ln , but only after the massive media attention and most not for sexual harassment but rather theft and intimidation . 
  these massive festivals are a terrible place to gather evidence . 
  perpetrators are save because they are * en masse * . 
  true conviction unfortunately requires proof of one to one harassment . 
  i 've tried so many times to explain people that these flyers handed out in german swimming pools on how to behave , well . . * modestly * have no effect if the target group , in this case mostly young men with immigration background from an islamic country ( just to put it in official terms ) , is not influenced at all . 
  these * norms * are thought by your family , your surroundings , your society during your entire childhood . 
  awareness among the victims wo n't let the perpetrators gain any . 
  i think i will just copy your post instead , well said . 
  it 's called antisemitism . 
  as it is directed to that one particular group . 
  they might just took the mexico-eu trade deal . 
  did some regexp search and replace by replacing every occurrence of eu to uk and were set . 
  * hon hon hon * i just a disapproving frenchman, 
   ( oh and schulz , merkel and tony blair seem to hate him , which helps ) . 
  if i could draw cartoons i would have loved to make a cartoon of farage kissing one of them now , in the style of the brehznjev photo or the charlie hebdo cover , titled : * the actual secret desire of farage *, 
   now that will take some serious training for meps ... 
  * kanker/tyfus/kolere / tering/takke/syfus / ... * oh , do n't mind me , i think i 've been reading accidentally through the doctors ' reports out loud . 
  sorry is n't it a colourful replacement of english ? 
  it 's located on the top of a mountain now . 
  i think we gained land . 
  the ijsselmeer and markermeer are gone . 
  the sun made the netherlands ~ ~ great ~ ~ big again !, 
  yeah , at least adopt the flemish dutch dialect ( it 's not an own language , just like austrian german ) since 1 ) people wo n't hurt their throats while learning the language 2 ) they actually do apply the grammar better than we do .
