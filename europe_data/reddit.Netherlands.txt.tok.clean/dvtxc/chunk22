  it gets worse the more north you go . 
  this was actually the dutch football commentary at the end of the match : * `` and ... . 
  it 's brexit for england !!, 
  you mean like psoe ? 
  so they are on the same line with them ? 
  can i safely call up * ultraleft * ? 
  or do these prefixes not apply to left-wing parties ? 
  according to rumours he would have liked a seat next to her to be arranged during that correspondence dinner . 
  ( he actually sat next to her during that show . ), 
  so the uk implodes ? 
  vanishes ? 
  where does the queen go to ? 
  i start doubting he 's actually looking for one . 
  although he made some awkward moves towards one of our film actresses during the correspondence dinner . 
  i know , and the reason so many prisons are empty over here is because the police stopped doing their main task ... or actually they do but rather because judges have so much empathy with convicted that the punishments would have become funny , if it was n't such a sad situation in reality . 
  and i 'm serious : physical harassment or injuring someone gives you some hours of civil service . 
  sometimes even just a mere ban from a certain are or city centre for a couple of months . 
  exactly this happened with the dutch referendum on the association treaty with ukraine a few months ago . 
  whether you supported it or not , it was an official referendum , as the required amount of signatures had been collected ( twice ! ), 
  and the subject had been approved by the election board . 
  if you did n't like the subject , one could as well just have filled in a blank vote . 
  if you wanted to see these so called * populists * to lose , one could just vote in favour of the eu-treaty and see the opposers lose the next day ... well , guess what kind of tactics some people actually used ? 
  they did n't vote in ' * protest * ' . 
  though , against the odds , the voting treshold had been reached , and the no-camp won the referendum . 
  suddenly the opinion of the non-voters mattered . 
  if one does not like referenda , because they would be * populist tools * , one should vote the political parties that oppose referenda . 
  if you want to make the best out of it : vote your choice . 
  though , i 'm sometimes ashamed of my generation , as they always seek shelter in victimhood as soon as they do n't get what they want , without actually doing something against it . 
  i do n't even see the younger generation as '' * politically engaged * '' . 
  their parents sacrificed a lot to gain democratic mechanisms , yet they do n't use them and whine when things do n't go according to their opinions . 
  it 's apparently something ` safe spaces ' can do to someone 's mind . 
  to all these youngsters i can say one thing : democracy is not a toy . 
  it 's a really powerful mechanism . 
  you can preach to the choir in your closed communities as much as you want , pretend to be idealist , politically engaged and signal your virtues around on the social media , but to actually enforce your opinion , you should go to the vote ballots . 
  a voter of my most hated party , but accepts fair electoral results , will always be a better friend than someone who votes the same but calls everyone a bigot if reality turns against him / ( us ) . 
  the internet never forgets : http://www.geenstijl.nl/archives/images/vaticaantjes.png, 
  see my other reaction as well : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pxlzr/petition_for_second_british_eu_referendum/d4ok6d3 i 'm sure they will scan through the ip-addresses . 
  if set up correctly , the petition form collects those as well . 
  this will be the first indication . 
  after the united states , after uruguay , after uzbekistan and after vanuatu . 
  they could as well try to retrieve ip addresses , since this is nothing more than a summary ... now i am not immediately convinced by the fraud ( 42.261 is n't much compared to 3m ) , but i wanted to point out it 's under investigation at this point , and it surely is peculiar at least . 
  let 's await further results . 
  here is a link to the json-query the site performs to calculate the total number of votes ( json transfers the server response to gather the server sided data ) : https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215.json code snippet : { `` name '' : `` uganda '' , `` code '' : `` ug '' , `` signature_count '' :51 } , { `` name '' : `` ukraine '' , `` code '' : `` ua '' , `` signature_count '' :93 } , { `` name '' : `` united arab emirates '' , `` code '' : `` ae '' , `` signature_count '' :2267 } , { `` name '' : `` united kingdom '' , `` code '' : `` gb '' , `` signature_count '' :3023319 } , { `` name '' : `` united states '' , `` code '' : `` us '' , `` signature_count '' :12027 } , { `` name '' : `` uruguay '' , `` code '' : `` uy '' , `` signature_count '' :84 } , { `` name '' : `` uzbekistan '' , `` code '' : `` uz '' , `` signature_count '' :41 } , { `` name '' : `` vanuatu '' , `` code '' : `` vu '' , `` signature_count '' :37 } , { `` name '' : `` vatican city '' , `` code '' : `` va '' , `` signature_count '' :42261 } , { `` name '' : `` venezuela '' , `` code '' : `` ve '' , `` signature_count '' :25 } the peculiar thing about this list is the high number of votes from vatican city , which only has a population of a mere 1000 people . 
  ** edit 15:24 cest : ** json-script seems to be altered : vatican city has been reset , just as north korea . 
  wow , the irony : youth screaming for a second opinion on the eu-referendum , whilst they remained at home with an abominably low turnout according to sky news : https://twitter.com/skydata/status/746700869656256512 can anyone confirm this data by some other sources ? 
  -- anyways , these figures give me the impression that the youth , who -- according to the media -- is so politically and socially engaged , actually did n't give anything about this referendum , as the retirees ' turnout was more than twice as big compared to theirs . 
  demographic group | turnout : -- | : -- 18-24 | 36 % 25-34 | 58 % 35-44 | 72 % 45-54 | 75 % 55-64 | 81 % 65 + | 83 % -- results according to yougov survey : demographic group | % remain : -- | : -- 18-24 | 75 % 25-49 | 56 % 50-64 | 44 % 65 + | 39 %, 
  furthermore , an increasing number of women exists whose eyecolour can not be determined at all on the streets ... ( \u00ac \u203f \u00ac ), 
  it better becomes german instead . 
  i do n't need that baguette language . 
  tl ; dr for european history of the 21st-century so far : european citizens request proper safety measures due to recent socio-economic developments on the continent , governments collectively decline request and propagates the new way of living their citizens should adopt . 
  first defeat ? ... ah ** euro ** defeat . 
  * hehehe . 
  what ? 
  since when , i thought we sold the last ones to finland . 
  as far as i know , they are stationed in germany . 
  yes we have a cooperative tank division , but the tanks are licensed to us for use , we do n't own them . 
  though , if it ever will come to a war , i would be perfectly fine with them bringing bikes and us bringing tanks to the battle . 
  dude , they already get fully turned on and wild by every girl in * winter clothes * celebrating new year 's eve . 
  letting them walk around * nude * would be the most effective way to get the rest of middle east this way . 
  how is that even possible ? 
  they have our tanks . 
  glorious analogy with the fifa and football . 
  eloquent speech and paraphrasing exactly my thoughts . 
  if only these kind of people would get the airtime they deserve ... ** edit : ** i agree with u/heknarf , who is that girl ? 
  until you get to know our prime minister . 
  he will follow her blindly just to get the impression that he has any significance . 
  we even sometimes make jokes about our pm that he calls his mother when he is on a photo with merkel . 
  death to dubbed translations !, 
   mainly because of the people telling me to vote leave - putin , trump , farage , boris ... just like bankers and multinational organisations telling you to vote remain . 
  it would be funny ... if political tensions were n't rising again as we have seen in the past years . 
  now at least i trust the germans for taking care of our tanks . 
  just imagine the things that could happen if we let the french take care of that ... 
  got convinced after seeing the cello brothers . 
  https://youtu.be/nkcm5ct9ggi now i have to see that !, 
  well , you have that enormous wealth fund at your disposal , have n't you ? 
  cool , so maybe some kind of armageddon happens as well and the uk will turn into atlantis ? 
  or sceneries from * children of men * will become real in the uk . 
  sure thing . 
  / s so far , i 've been questioning myself which side had more click-bait articles about this referendum ... 
  yes , i got a notice as well by email from youtube . 
  since - * of course * - i used footage from the public broadcaster . 
  i just put damn subtitles under it and gave them a broader audience ... * sigh *, 
  not your average documentary of the netherlands . 
  just some excerpts from a documentary about how our country looks like from above . 
  quickly subtitled . 
  may contain some mistakes . 
   in response to the question of ` how does your average neighbourhood look like in your country ' on this sub, 
  dear flemish , why do you spell the word _ verzendkosten _ so weird ? 
  let 's not deviate that much from the conventional spelling , shall we ? 
  yours sincerely , your northern neighbours . 
  that \u00f8 proves it : everyone knows that ikea is obviously danish . 
  / s * triggering intensifies *, 
  this is just brilliant . 
  though , how did they acquire the copyrights and how did ikea ever accept that their design language would be used for political purposes ? 
  probably some unrelated people have been assassinated as well . 
  two people have been killed who were most probably mistaken for someone else . 
  multiple times houses of innocent people have been damaged because of collateral damage . 
  one time the bullets just missed a sleeping baby by some centimetres . 
  add to the gun fights one beheading and a public display of the head in a regular street in amsterdam .
