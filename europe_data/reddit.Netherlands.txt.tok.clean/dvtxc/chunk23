  they could even better call it trier airport, 
   it is believed the attacker was using a ** hunting rifle ** to target the bus from a bridge over the a7 motorway near saulce sur rhone , roughly halfway between lyon and marseille . 
  i know that most people do n't actually read the linked article ... ironically though , i did n't either first , as i knew this from the details that were given in our 8 o'clock news broadcast , but apparently the bbc mentions the same . 
  this can only be done by sick-minded people . 
  now ' * luckily * ' there are only some injured . 
  a hunting rifle can do some serious one-shot damage , considering the typical ammo size . 
  hm ... based on this interview i 've already more sympathy for this guy than our foreign minister . 
  honestly , those are some well formulated answers . 
  in a country where distances are big , cars are a necessity and thus action radius becomes important . 
  now i understand if we would introduce something like this ( and yes , at least one party already did , but still i would reject this proposal ) , but norway is not really the kind of country i would start with this deadline . 
  and moreover , i just dislike bans in general , just let the electric cars develop a bit further . 
  they will really become attractive , and cost effective in the long run as well . 
  have my upvote sir, 
  i 'm not saying that it will or will not happen in a country that will introduce a ubi , i 'm saying that it might empower a government to influence it more directly . 
  or at least , that 's how far my economical knowledge goes , but seems to be a reasonable theory , as the government will directly influence how much money will be flowing into the society . 
  if one orders the central banks to print more money , this money does n't necessarily flow directly into the society , right ? 
  now , disclaimer provided : i 'm a noob on economic issues , but somehow i 'm interested to have a eli5 on this . 
  just a random question about random income : does n't a universal basic income give a country an enormous and direct control of the inflation rate of the country ? 
  ( considering this is done in a country that is not part of a larger monetary union ) raising the basic income , will most certainly directly influence the entire inflation rate immediately ... 
  ** this ** is what frustrates me so much . 
  the sad fact , however , is that most educated people with anti-immigration stances wo n't dare to express their opinion in public , let alone go into politics , as they fear reputation damage and the risk of not being able to get a decent job interview in the future . 
  ( because , you know , unspoken rule of virtue signaling we 're all obliged to ) because of this , these parties are always also full of lunatics , they 've nothing to lose . 
  the leader of our current biggest anti-immigration party has a failed '' * career * '' at some small insurance company . 
  gosh , we once had a male version of frauke petry ( anti-immigrant , yet educated ) in the nl who was actually gay himself ... 
  old news , they started their own party and * stole * the seats in the parliament . 
  ( if you exit a party while being a member of the parliament , you become an `` independent '' member . ), 
  two turkish mp 's now started a new party while remaining their seats . 
  should i remind you of the awful build quality of the * wooden * houses in tornado alley ? 
  you guys truly build carboard homes over there . 
  though , these are absolute numbers . 
  our total population increased as well in these years . 
  yeah , heard about this one . 
  thought they had started broadcasting / r/nottheonion on public broadcasters for a sec . 
  though i have to admit , some teenagers are truly complete morons for crossing intersections whilst using their phones . 
  trust me , amsterdam has become a city overrun by massive asian tourist waves during daylight and hordes of drunk british sex tourists at night . 
  right outside the city centre , a drugs war between * moroccan-dutch * is going on . 
  sometimes , they mistakenly kill the wrong ones . 
  -- no okay , it 's a little bit dramatised , but honestly , i still do not understand why literally everyone is heading for amsterdam . 
  it 's not even fun anymore being over there sometimes , as it is truly over crowded by tourists . 
  just wondering : what ** if ** the war in syria ended tomorrow . 
  what part of these * refugees * would actually go back and show that they truly only escaped for the war ? 
  * sigh * those 1,3 million in germany are permanent , right ? 
  the government even wants it to be like that . 
  exactly , it 's not even the problem that native germans speak faster , sometimes they even seem to * swallow * the end of their words . 
  i really followed this guy 's pronunciation clearly . 
  uk : must be polish plumbing . 
  * always * was a characterisation ( maybe a stereotype ) based on actual topics i have had with german friends and my knowledge of their stances . 
  this does n't affect my opinion of them in general , i just skip certain topics as i do n't want to destroy good friendships because of this . 
  well i know some who have different opinions , but they are a minority , at least in my circle of friends . 
  now , i hope i answered you . 
  so being right is being against abortion , not understanding simple consequences of greenhouse gasses , etc. ? 
  ok , serious question , try to judge me then . 
  i think i 'm getting an identity crisis now because of you : i 'm eurosceptic , against immigrating wild wealth seekers , against wishful thinking concerning a multicultural society , but support abortion , gay rights and think we really should do something about our fossil fuel dependence immediately . 
  what am i ? 
  i think the classical distinction between * left * and * right * does n't stand anymore . 
  * faith in ( some ) germans restored . 
  * i always feel i 'm dismantling a bomb while being colour-blind when the topic changes to the refugee crisis while i 'm talking with germans . 
  this happens in the netherlands and is actually a tradition . 
  there is one small municipality that only has one polling station and people sometimes specially come to this place to achieve a turnout of over 100 % . 
  the polling station is literally located in the living room of a family . 
  it started as a joke , now they get these ridiculous turnouts at every election . 
  it 's the town marle with around 70 inhabitants of which 50 are eligible to vote . 
  links ( in dutch ) * https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/marle_ ( olst-wijhe ) * http://www.nu.nl/salland/4013486/opkomst-bij-kleinste-stembureau-marle-meer-dan-honderd-procent.html turnouts tend to be between 110 % and 160 % -- edit : i do have to say , that it would be weird in this town , as waldhoven seems to be a town of over 10.000 inhabitants . 
  what , greenland and f\u00e6r\u00f8er are n't enough for you guys ? 
  what if someone is an atheist ? 
  did they say the same actually in the years before ? 
  i mean , the fp\u00d6 is n't new . 
  would like to see trump vs sanders over there . 
  in both cases the usa wo n't lose that much . 
  if trump wins and things fail , at least they will do something about immigration politics . 
  if sanders wins and things fail , at least they get a bit of the european social health care system . 
  reading the twitter stream at this moment is like people around the world really thought that austria has been fighting some group of lunatics and got saved at the very last minute by the holy st. green a.k.a. 
  now you can think of the fp\u00d6 whatever you want , but in my opinion it 's not an extremist party and people should not forget it still managed to get half a nation behind them . 
  i 've mostly visited max 3 story houses , most of them all have outwards opening windows , especially the windows in dormers . 
  my neighbourhood has mostly houses from the 70s , all with outward opening windows unless one decided to install custom ones . 
  in case they opened inwards , the windows utilised a simple mechanism and not the one that allows 2 degrees of freedom . 
  almost all windows in the netherlands open outwards . 
  i 've only seen this system featured in the video in germany , austria and norway . 
  and yes sometimes i 'm just closing and opening the windows for fun over there because the system is so cool . 
  usa is declining again ? 
  gib farage ? 
  the fp\u00d6 should introduce a self-regulating mechanism to ban these people on party congresses or something similar and make clear what the limits are . 
  i mean , the afd is fighting its nazi image by rejecting stances which are considered too extremist on large congresses and they even got rid of some extremists in saarland , did n't they ? 
  in my opinion this makes the afd a true party despite their young age . 
  the media is literally hunting for these nazis in right wing parties as their reveal has proven to be a successful tool to demoralise people to vote on these parties , while on the left end of the spectrum , some parties are home to quite obscure anarchists as well . 
  to come back to my point : a `` similar '' party in the netherlands is truly lead by just one person ... 
  i actually wished we had a mature party like austria has on the right , instead of a zombie party like we have now . 
  blood is reaching boiling point at this moment . 
   one of the suspects , an egyptian man , was deported out of the netherlands in the past but entered the country again on a fake syrian passport . 
  can confirm , have heard the same in the local news . 
  nevertheless , the very fact that this has been possible is beyond my understanding . 
  * more peculiar was the fact that he [ his friend ] , although being searched by the dutch authorities , was able to flee to egypt without any problems . 
  according to his lawyer , y. flew via brussels airport and crossed the borders without trouble . 
  * good job . 
  auch , we do n't have a hot potato in our throats !, 
  -- though , at least it 's on the international ( us ) edition : standard stereotypes confirmed . 
  did anyone say killing weed ? 
  do n't even start counting the number of governments in belgium ... 
  it 's more than you think , and will make you wonder how that country still exists ... 
   note that you can also use the masculine indefinite article instead of using the feminine indefinite article ( en instead of ei ) .
