  it 's therefore correct to say for instance ei jente and en jente . 
  these kind of things . 
   it looks like you are heading towards a common gender and neutral as only left-over genders . 
  there , indeed , exist dialects in the south that do n't have these `` cough '' sounds , and use the ' * ch * ' like in german or the ' * kj * ' like in norwegian . 
  yes , the german one is a lot softer than ours . 
  actually , you could see it as an gliding scale in the netherlands + belgium . 
  the more northern you go , the harsher our ' * ch * ' and ' * g * ' will be pronounced . 
  some say they get a cold up there in the north because of the weather , now you know the truth . 
  / s :p, 
  * country : hongarij\u00eb . 
  * demonym : hongaar , plural : hongaren * language : hongaars although , [ this list of dutch words from 1914 ] ( http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22722/22722-h/woordenlijst1914-full.html ) still issues the word ' ** magyaar ** ' as demonym for the people from hungary . 
  ( ctrl + f , magyaar ) we apparently changed something . 
  shht , otherwise i start calling you `` austria 's backyard '' . 
  oh you ... 
  yeah and actually i think we should start fighting the influence from english if we want to let our language survive for the next century . 
  but in all honesty , yes , we actually did some similar things in the past ... 
  in 1947 we had some interesting spelling reform which removed most of the left declension system we had for our articles and adjectives in the past . 
  actually our declension system was really like the german language has . 
  we had a full distinction between the male , female and neutral gender before . 
  ( the distinction between male and female has become really vague in most dialects . 
  just as in bokm\u00e5l , right ? ), 
  somehow , we had the urge to remove this right after the war , including the declensions and some other `` germanic-like '' grammar . 
  perhaps these grammatical rules were doomed to get extinct anyway , but one at least had to apply the rules in formal language . 
  last but not least . 
  thanks to my knowledge of english , dutch and german , i have surprisingly little trouble reading norwegian . 
   no really , reading a sentence is like matching the words to words from either one of the three languages , and it seems to be pretty well equally distributed . 
  oh gosh , when are you going to admit that nynorsk was a failed nationalistic attempt except in , well bergen maybe ? 
  :p but yes , your dialects are crazy . 
  are you using other dictionaries over there in the south ? 
  it 's most probably because holland hosts all the tourist attractions the tourists come for . 
  whether it are asians coming for the tulip fields , brits for amsterdam to get high and wasted , germans for our beaches , almost everything is in holland . 
  norwegians use the word * nederland * to designate the country at least . 
  ~ source 4 months in norway . 
  so maybe not the best source . 
  * simplest and at the same time covering explanation . 
  both of them are allowed . 
  ** estisch ** and ** ests ** , although the latter one could be confused with the demonym plural or a geographical adjective if not capitalised . 
  until you learn how to actually pronounce it . 
  do n't call us holland !, 
  ( even though i 'm actually from the province of holland , i do have empathy for the other provinces 's inhabitants . ), 
  get your geographical names in your language straight . 
  :p [ holland vs the netherlands by * cgp grey * on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee_iupineuc ) -- ** edit : ** trolls from either south or north holland downvoting this post . 
  s\u00fcd tirol can into austria ? 
  join us flanders , before it 's too late !, 
  honestly , i would rather have a new nuclear reactor build in our country than billions thrown at solar panels and wind turbines . 
  the developments in nuclear reactor technology look promising . 
  since we only have one commercial reactor in the nl at this moment we could benefit from the [ * law of the handicap of a head start * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_the_handicap_of_a_head_start ) other countries will experience , and start right off with newer generations of reactors : thorium molten salt ( theoretically inherently safe + low waste ) or small pebble bed minireactors ( as mentioned in the article ) . 
  yes , that 's dutch . 
  ~ confirmed by a dutch person . 
  normally , texts which are too offensive wo n't reach the mass , as you will be the one who stands out from the public . 
  inspirationless , just utterly offensive kinds of '' * art * '' , wo n't catch on . 
  freedom of speech ** usually ** tends to be surprisingly well self-regulating . 
  this time , however , there was apparently a need for this * poem * . 
  the discussion about erdogan and his never ending search for power expansion already existed and this action of b\u00f6hmerman , therefore , was in my opinion a completely lawful contribution to the public debate . 
  the following intervention of erdogan and the massive amount of support b\u00f6hmerman received in the following days proved this point . 
  this `` artistic freedom '' , which the article cites , is subject to changes depending on political and social developments . 
  imho , the judged failed to acknowledge this . 
  i think we 've seen worse things on our television . 
  especially some kind of dutch imitation of the `` epic rap battles of history '' in which merkel and putin were featured . 
  we have had a long tradition of a satirical portrayal of our own royal family . 
  i mean , not reacting on this shows your maturity , especially if it does n't happen in your country . 
  -- side note : i actually liked the song erdowie , erdowo , erdogan more , but more because it was catchy .

   german baguettes you mean * laugenbrezel * :p it 's about time you make dutch mandatory over there . 
  in the meanwhile , we could make them a vassal state . 
  no no , we need flanders . 
  or perhaps entire belgium . 
  and we are going to remove the baguette language in the south . 
  all this glory , we will double the height of the highest point in our country to a mere 700 m !, 
  make the netherlands ~ ~ big ~ ~ great again !, 
  * right , flanders ? 
  i do n't know . 
  although i 've met some finnish people , i have n't met anyone from estonia . 
  i 've only heard finnish before and am able to recognise it by its characteristics . 
  right in the childhood . 
   to be pretty politically correct in public , but mind-numbingly offensive in private ( never been to a house without racist jokes , and that includes a lot of ` good ' houses ) . 
  hehe , we have got plenty of good ones of them , have n't we ? 
  sounds finnish to me . 
  would not be able to tell the difference . 
  the netherlands is if you look at the current account balance ( also referred to as * trade balance * ) even more of a * exporting country * expressed in percent of the gdp than germany . 
  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2187.html http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/index.aspx just for the sake of export the wages are kept low , while inflation is on par with other eu-countries . 
  the only thing we 've seen so far is that our consumer purchasing power is behind those of our neighbours and this difference is relatively becoming larger . 
  some even say that this trading balance is * unhealthy * to have for such a long time . 
  but i honestly do not understand how we are trying to compete with the low wage countries . 
  although some high tech companies are growing , indeed , a lot of our industry still is in fields like steel production . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koninklijke_hoogovens our enormous natural gas export may have to cease as well in the coming decades , and we really did n't think of putting this into a wealth fund like norway did .
