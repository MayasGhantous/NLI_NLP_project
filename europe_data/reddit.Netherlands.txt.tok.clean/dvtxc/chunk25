  supported them actually , but the jury disliked them a lot apparently . 
  who did give them that one point actually ? 
  furthermore , we were given zero points by our neighbours . . traitors . 
  even estonia gave us more . 
   should be considered i never thought these immigrants would settle permanently over here in the first place . 
  when i started to listen our mainstream media again , i was baffled . 
  we are literally pushing them to settle permanently and they say it on the telly like it 's a good thing . 
  * ( intended graham norton reference ) *, 
  maintaining law and order in the banlieus of paris is n't cheap either ... 
  good thing dutch cable providers just broadcast bbc as well by default . 
  our commenters are awful . 
  / r/badeconomics ? 
  the explanation i can think of is that this chart is based on data from 2011 . 
  i do n't know whether regulations have changed since then . 
  i know for example that germany introduced quite some big reforms in their road tax calculation a few years ago . 
  furthermore these cars where new when this data was retrieved and are a mere 5 years old by now . 
  well , we had some pig corpses at places that were designated to host a refugee center here in the netherlands . 
  pigs have been used at a construction site for a mosque as well . 
  spilled pork . 
  with those roads ?

  source : https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/18150/vehicles.pdf extra note on high danish registration tax : danish car and motorcycle owners pay a tax on registering their vehicle of 105 percent of its value for vehicles bought for under 81,700 kroner , and 180 percent of the value for vehicles bought for over this price . 
  will upload an updated version . 
  i seem to have swapped a column .

  map : http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/04/06/uitslagenkaart-oekrainereferendum no , actually cities like the hague and rotterdam had a pretty big majority against the treaty . 
  the only cities that did n't follow this trend , and actually had the biggest majority in favour of the treaty were amsterdam , utrecht and by far : wageningen . 
  how surprisingly that these cities mockingly have always been called * leftist cities * . 
  but , anyways , the majority of the voters who were in favour of the treaty were found in the student cities : university cities in favour : * amsterdam * ( two universities ) * * groningen * leiden * ( 2nd largest university ) * * nijmegen * utrecht * ( largest university ) * * wageningen * ( mostly environmental ) * university cities against : * delft * ( only technical ) * * eindhoven * ( only technical ) * * enschede * ( only technical ) * * maastricht * rotterdam * ( mostly economic/business ) * ... and pretty much most other municipalities were against as well . 
  exactly this . 
  when studying abroad , this is basically the first thing they ask . 
  and i always have to disappoint them on this question , even though i 've got plenty of friends who could give me some and the nearest coffee shop is just a 5 minute walk from my campus . 
  but at least i met an american who tried to improve the american stereotypes and guessed my language right at once . 
  i was surprised as most times i speak german according to them ... : /, 
  :p * i believe that suffix `` artig '' in this phrase makes a big difference , is n't it ? 
  * otherwise i think we have to warn silesia and pomerania ... 
  i always get confused by the us/european definition of liberalism . 
  since fiscal conservative parties are actually called economic liberal in the netherlands for example . 
  ( examples : nl : vvd | de : fdp ) * ( only true conservative parties in the nl are confessional ( religious ) parties which are n't that big . 
  they only win at some local municipal elections . 
  ) * though wilders pretends to be economically left-wing , mostly gaining votes for the pensioners and the working class , he actually complies with the bills and amendments of the economically right-wing parties ( like vvd in nl ) . 
  random more or less political related question : why are you actually using a 5 % threshold in germany ? 
  how to translate danish to norwegian : replace g by k. do sometimes some wizardry with d/t or dt . 
  and yeah , the rest is pretty much the same . 
  but their sound difference . 
  0 . o it 's like they are from two different language families ... 
  finally , a non-english entry . 
  it does n't even have to be french . 
  quite often seen as the second language on eurovision . 
  i would probably like their entries just as much if they just sang in german , or heck even in their own valley dialect . 
  nah , actually because he 's a twat . 
  may the annual freak show commence . 
  ^ ^ oh ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ vote ^ ^ for ^ ^ us , ^ ^ plox . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ like ^ ^ our ^ ^ entry . 
  just leaving a comment here , as i am really interested in the source . 
  no , but seriously : this really seems to become a default template for ( imho simple and meaningless ) condolences on social media . 
  on topic : this news makes me sad ... hm no angry ... no sad . 
  both . 
  good . 
  sane people still exist . 
  accept some gold . 
  i think you , lads , are not the only one trying to conquer ibiza ... 
  prepare for both dutch and german rivalry , although the dutch may head towards chersonissos in greece in case the invasion of ibiza fails . 
  but nevertheless , i still do n't understand why people are going there , tbh ... 
  could we hire some of your news editors for our public broadcaster ? 
  ours is using tax moneys for migrants ' pr . 
  nrk will be put on the auto-moderator 's ban list alongside daily mail and the sun in 3 ... 2 ... 1 / s, 
  hm , if they want to counteract an aging society , i think these kind of policies would make more fun : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vro3tfjc9qw :p but in all seriousness , we had regulated mass immigration in the past . 
  and its policies failed . 
  the mass influx of moroccan and turkish labour force in the 60s and 70s was thought to be temporary and to boost our economy . 
  although it did boost our economy , the immigrants actually settled in our country without ever properly integrating . 
  now one would think that if something like this is done again , immigration policies would have been improved , but unfortunately none of this is true . 
  2nd and 3rd generations of the first immigrant have radicalised way more than their parents , segregated from the rest of the society . 
  the people we are importing now , have the same attitude while they are just the first generation immigrants . 
  god help us , if we fail to integrate them and their offspring again in the same way . 
  i have had , and luckily still have , some really good turkish friends . 
  unfortunately , i am not able to speak with some of them , as they gradually just turned their back to the dutch society who supported them for so long . 
  they are willing to give up their dutch identity if they had to . 
  and the most ironically of this all is : that the turkish people have been considered to be the best integrated of the two groups . 
  sometimes even functioning as an ` example ' our dutch-moroccans should follow ... well ... and to actually answer the * presumed master plan behind these immigration politics * : ** if ** it would be true , let them please state the actual reason , instead of disguising it as an * humanitarian obligation * or * humanitarian guilt pay back * ( de media ) . 
  because this disguise is what enrages me the most . 
  exactly what this comment beneath the article says :  i spend a good part of the year in italy , and it 's clear to me the italians are playing a double game here . 
  they are against `` populist '' responses to migrants because they know that most of the migrants do n't want to stay in italy . 
  thus the italians pretend to be humanitarians when what they really want is simply to pass this problem on to others through open borders . 
  the rubber will hit the road for the italians when all the borders slam shut . 
  then they 'll actually have to do something , and most likely it will be the same thing their northern neighbours have already done . 
  besides , i still do not understand why stances against mass immigration are always immediately considered * populist * , as i mean : the discussion on how the welfare state should be directed is a discussion that has been going on for decades in most european countries . 
  it 's the classical debate between social democrats and economic liberals . 
  we always used to have chavs who mostly reaped and harvested the social welfare in our countries . 
  i think that almost every country has its own stereotype . 
  now we get a sudden increase in ~ ~ economic migrants ~ ~ people who not only put strain on our healthcare system , but our safety system as well , and now the cutting on welfare expenses is suddenly considered * populist * . 
  in my opinion it is actually securing the very existence of the welfare state . 
  yeah , i know , european anti-immigration parties usually come with other shitty stances as well . 
  but i can say exact the same about so many so-called * intelligent * left wing socialist ( or those green ) parties as well . 
  i really applaud their stances on workers ' rights , but then if you scroll down their party program ... ... . . 
  so , as long your country does n't have direct democracy where individual bills are valued by its inhabitants , tied goods will be an inevitable part of the politics , and considering current problems in europe i might as well be a so-called * populist * during the next election . 
  the new iron curtain will divide europe into north-south instead of west-east i guess . 
  well , to be honest , i did n't know what the actual status is . 
  i just know it 's a recurring topic in our news , and it is said that the plans are postponed every time ...
