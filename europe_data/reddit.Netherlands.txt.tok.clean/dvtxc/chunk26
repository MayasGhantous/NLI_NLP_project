  but anyways , how are you going to finance the infrastructure instead ? 
  nowadays , it seems you have roadworks literally every 20km ( like srsly , when are you done on the a8 :p ) i have read that most bridges will have to be replaced sooner or later as well . 
  http://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2015-03/pkw-maut-infrastrukturabgabe well , not yet , but the plans exist . 
  it literally enraged all dutch car owners as germans will be compensated for the toll ... for us , however , the autobahn will become more expensive to drive on . 
  we get finnish clay now ? 
  prove it by exempting us from maut on the autobahn . 
  lol . 
  i 'm 12 cm above average ... . . in the netherlands . 
  do you know how fucked up that is ? 
  * doorposts in foreign countries are your biggest enemy . 
  * seats in economy class just hate you . 
  * luggage racks in trains and buses just hate you . 
  * your friends ' cars just hate you . 
  * the ikea bed assortment just hates you . 
  * ** you can not into space . 
   but right now germany doesnt have a single political party that isnt completely useless . 
  that amount of negatives in one sentence just gave me a headache . 
  in switzerland and austria it 's usually also a good idea to stay in the alms and alpine huts for the night . 
  they are inexpensive and you 'll need considerably less luggage to take with you and just go from hut to hut at heights a car can not reach . 
   ( well usually . 
  those austrians drive their cars literally to insane heights if they have to ), 
  if there 's one thing i hate : it 's family-style camping . 
  and if there 's something i hate even more : it 's dutch camper vans and caravans on the autobahn and on alpine roads . 
  i 'm not your average dutchman . 
  i think switzerland , generally speaking , attracts different tourists than croatia . 
  although i have been in switzerland and have to say that the country is astounding , so are the prices . 
  so , will be visiting medulin , istria in a few months . 
  any tips and must-visits in the vicinity ? 
  these accents are done brilliantly !, 
  one of the very first things i was told as a kid : * do n't open the door to strangers *, 
  hm , i 've read that torches and pitchforks have been quite efficient as well ... 
  the scale is rather misleading . 
  look at the distribution , the colours are almost distributed logarithmic . 
  what ? 
  we got liberated ? 
  now the temperatures reached over 20 degrees this week we are already getting the first new wave occupying our beaches . 
  be aware of the sand holes !, 
   weissbier is practically rainwater anyway triggered, 
  as long as we are allowed to keep our extreme party proportional representation for the landtagswahlen . 
  on a second thought , i think we will be mistaken for the saxons , as we tend to elect anti-immigrant parties as the second biggest party quite often . 
  that is a saxony/bayern mix ( with weed ) of 17 mln .

  yes yes , and the country bears the corresponding name [ ** ` mofrika ' ** ] ( https://youtu.be/mco0j0sqj70?t=18 ) ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  you ca n't use that tool to build dykes . 
  it makes you wonder about how the renaissance could start in italy from all countries . 
  i have never been with flixbus . 
  just a question that concerns me : is it doable if you are over 1m95 ? 
  ( without getting out of the bus crippled ),

  you can find data on the number of internet users in eurostat . 
  that might provide an additional useable variable as weighting . 
  this can not be unseen anymore ... 
  i have never understood the persons who use it towards their grandparents . 
  you know your own family , do n't you ? 
  i 'll use it towards people i meet on the street which i do n't know . 
  towards colleagues from another division . 
  in official correspondence ( including e-mail ) . 
  or people with whom i have a functional relationship and are higher in function . 
  i would not call it * old-fashioned * . 
  somehow it just did not catch on in internet speech , and therefore * jij/je * is always used on online message boards . 
  maybe create some kind of gro\u00dfdeutschland ? 
  so we can unite together with the mountain germans . 
  i remember occasionally posting this map in some threads on r/europe a year ago . 
  good to see that ** operatie aansluiting ** is catching on on the internet . 
  ** ducks *, 
  did not know they were that small .

  it is for within urban areas , which is 50 km/h in almost every country , except for the uk because non-metric . 
  this is an * incident * . 
  [ over 14 000 refugees in sweden are reported * `` missing '' * ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article21823230.ab ) after receiving instructions to leave the country . 
  since they are not particularly given shelter by well-loving liberal swedes , but most likely other persons that already know how to evade the swedish law , try to estimate the chance of radicalisation among those missing ... naivety and law-enforcing incompetence provide a dangerous cocktail . 
  though i am not solely bashing on sweden , as similar figures exist for the netherlands . 
  there has been a nice graph here on r/europe summarising all public perceptions of the news papers . 
  denmark scored the most * neutral * . 
  i ca n't recall whether spain was on that list . 
   normally they are not i am not buying a newspaper that * normally is not lying * , as long as i do n't know what the * normal * conditions are . 
   the whole maut thing for instance is idiotic populism . 
   luxemburg flair good to see we are not the only neighbouring country to germany who does not like this toll plan . 
  i do not really see the taz as the counterpart of the faz . 
  to be honest , every time i come across some taz articles and i continue reading on their website , i feel like it is pushing an agenda . 
  maybe not so much as its counterpart * die junge freiheit * , because technically it 's better written and feels more like a real newspaper , but i would not say it is drastically different in the way it promotes a certain view . 
   taz -  not free of biases in one direction or the other that 's like one the biggest understatements in this thread . 
  i would not say that western press is lying . 
  if anything like that was revealed , they would take a huge trust damage and i do not think that news redactors are that stupid . 
  though a lot more can be achieved by careful selection , sorting and supplementary commentary . 
  as an example , one of the most read newspaper of the netherlands ( * de volkskrant * ) , featured some popular-scientific interview about microwave meals , a column about getting drunk and some showbizz news , and a picture of trump [ on the front page ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/archives/images/lalalala_nieuws.jpg ) on the day following the stockholm attack . 
  this selection would be justified if it was the silly season , though i do n't consider a day on which a terror attack happened in the capital of another eu country belonging to that . 
  let 's take another example : the aegean migrant route . 
  according to almost all major news outlets , the refugee influx dropped significantly since the migrant deal with turkey was made . 
  somehow this news is stressed quite often , whereas they do n't tell that turkey has actually numbered down the operations of their cost guard and border controls . 
  as a result , the number of immigrant crossing the turkish-greek and turkish-bulgarian ** land ** border has increased . 
  technically , it does not belong to the greek aegean see route . 
  true . 
  but that hides the other story behind it . 
  the major news outlets remain silent and stress the success of the migrant deal ( which again , strictly speaking is true news ) . 
  third example i remember vividly : several anti-israelian protests were organised in the hague in 2014 following the escalation of the gaza conflicts .
