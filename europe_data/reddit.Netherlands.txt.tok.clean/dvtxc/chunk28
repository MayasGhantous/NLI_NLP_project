  even more interesting to notice is that most metropolitan areas and university cities tend to have a significantly lower ratio than neighbouring areas ( even in eastern germany ) except for * kreis aachen * , home to the rtwh . 
  i have only taken the top 5 of both extremes . 
  neglecting the overseas regions of france ( mayotte and guadalope ) would make greece even occupy 9 out of 10 places , as the 6th and 7th region are also in greece . 
  however , place 8 till 30-ish are mostly occupied by metropolitan areas / university cities . 
  as a reaction on the following [ ** post by jakubmarian ** ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/male-to-female-sex-ratio-by-country-in-europe/ ) on the male to female sex ratio in europe :  although migration does influence the sex ratio , since more migrants in europe are women than men ( usually by around 10 % to 20 % ) , the resulting differences are similarly negligible as the differences in birth rate . 
  the total number of people gained or lost due to migration is usually less than 10 % of the total population , so migration typically causes differences of less than 0.02 ( 20 % of 10 % ) in the sex ratio . 
  big differences in the sex ratio seem to exist on regional level , most likely due to intra-national migration . 
  some regions even have ratios as high as 1.6 , for example the greek islands . 
  furthermore , most countries display an unequal distribution between metropolitan and rural areas , with the exception of ireland , italy and bulgaria . 
  -- apparently , the minus signs have disappeared in the table of the smallest percentages . 
  for clarification : the percentages for mayotte till guadalope should have minus signs in front of them , indicating that the population of females is higher than the population of males in those regions .

  yes , there are more dutch internet companies that are bigger than coolblue , such as adyen , valued at $ 2,3 bln . 
  just as skype has been bought by microsoft . 
  lol , i do n't understand the fuss about this joke of germany being a company ( apart from that word * personalausweis * ) we , and even the media , use the word `` de bv nederland '' occasionally when talking about the economy , which would translate as `` die niederlande gmbh '' . 
  help , i 'm on mobile , i do n't see any flag . 
  seriously , who made this colour scale ??? 
  a choropleth map whose colours i constantly have to look up , is a map with a terrible colour scale . 
  it lives among eu-philes as well . 
  i have talked to persons that truly believe in a federal europe , yet also state * they have nothing to hide from the government * and they would accept giving away more privacy if it benefited security . 
  as a somewhat eu-sceptic person and at the same time worrisome of giving up privacy , these persons creep me out . 
  darwin disapproves, 
  from south holland here , still triggered . 
  just like there is the dutch speaking country * sint-maarten * , which is part of the kingdom of the netherlands , bordering the french territory * saint-martin * on the island of * saint-martin * . 
  an island so nice , they named it thrice . 
  [ which brings me to my favourite video on youtube ] ( https://youtu.be/ee_iupineuc?t=107 ) [ or the complete clusterfuck ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o37yjbfrrfg ), 
  this . 
  going from tirol to steiermark always takes 4 times longer than from what you 'd expect from looking on the map . 
  it 's like they have made all their highways , tunnels and railways solely for germans going to the beaches in the south . 
  crossing those areas from the west to the east is however terrible . 
  the current system is even more * social * than the previous system . 
  the grant is still in place for those whose parents earn less , and at the same time students who will earn less , have a higher chance of not having to pay everything back . 
  we ca n't build upwards in an easy way , because of our terrible soil quality .

  so , we found the problem : berlin was made capital instead of vienna . 
  that was targeted at a specific person and therefore was a murder , albeit with possible terroristic motives . 
  ( indeed , the murderer was member of a terrorist network ) but none of the above attacks have been targeted at a specific person and only comprise attacks in public . 
  this graph bears a completely different sentiment than the one which was featured in huffpo . 
   if terrorism was really part of their culture the world would be a very different place . 
  [ background article : ** morocco 's outlaw country is the heartland of global terrorism ** ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/07/the-rif-connection-belgium-brussels-morocco-abdeslam/ ) explaining how entangled terrorism and the culture of people from the rif mountains are . 
  the double letters in dutch regulate the pronunciation of the vocals in a syllable in a relatively systematic manner . 
  the * o * in ` co \u00b7 mis \u00b7 sie ' would be pronounced differently than in ` com \u00b7 mis \u00b7 sie ' , just as the * a * in ` rad ' is vastly different than in ` raad ' . 
  sick . 
  the geographic coordinates were given in morse code ... ** 51.500947 , -0.124530 **, 
  must definitely be better than berlin . 
  in principle , we could circumvent energy storage problems by looking into different storage methods ... though i do n't think hydrogen has a really good name in commercial aviation . 
  / s ^ ^ hindenburg ^ ^ 2.0  what do you think the odds are that hybrid-prop might become a thing ? 
  it has no use in aviation . 
  there is , or has been , a market for hybrid cars are they can be used on short trips and on long trips . 
  airplanes are usually devoted to a single flight , either long-haul or short-haul flights . 
  did someone call me ? 
  thanks reddit . 
  the first thing i do with these lists now , is comparing our position with respect to finland . 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ we ^ ^ are ^ ^ better ^ ^ :p, 
   one possible complementary tech that i 'm exited about , is the contra-rotating prop . 
  it would work well with small runway aircraft , since it allows for more power output per area of prop-diameter . 
  but since it 's noisy as all hell , the tech is currently restricted to military use . 
  if elctric aircraft allow for the rise of a silent crp , then we may see a very efficient local flight landscape in the future . 
  i do n't think an electric engine will improve the noise level of those contra-rotating props . 
  most of the noise comes from the design itself , and the highly turbulent airflow . 
  it would be better to have higher prop diameters , which could be driven at lower rpms . 
   so the way things are now , battery weight and efficiency will limit this market short-range flights . 
  because it 's either heavy batteries , or unsafe ones , or a larger amount of inefficient ones . 
  until the development of safer li-ion , or more efficient nickel-based & pb-acid , or ultra-lightweight flow-batteries . 
  all of which are currently on the table in research labs . 
  do n't forget the life span of the batteries . 
  airliners wo n't adopt electric flight if they have to replace the batteries every two years in their entire fleet . 
  ah i see , after which [ we took luxemburg over from you ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/karte_haus_burgund_4_en.png ), 
  i would like to see one on amsterdam - berlin and amsterdam - london , since the first has a terrible train connection , whereas the latter forces you to go either by boat or all the way over calais . 
  this . 
  i want to see these great developments in technology !, 
  not the absurd taxation plans our greens want to impose over any means of transportation , which will bring our mobility back to the early 20th century . 
  moreover , i see the possibilities of expanding airports near cities if these planes are truly more quiet . 
  airport expansion is seriously hindered because of air pollution , though it is the accessibility to an airport that makes short-haul flights so attractive . 
  is that a greater-luxemburg for scale ? 
  that reloading mechanism looks sick . 
  though , adds a lot of parts that could get stuck in terrible conditions . 
  at least , you do n't risk your hands being blown apart when reloading at the wrong moment . 
  honest question : why would you want j\u00e4mtland back ? 
  at least , now tr\u00f8nder people can go shopping in storlien for cheap booze . 
  though , the part that has been given to russia is still home to the non-slavic language karelian , right ? 
  how is karelian related to finnish ?

  the high-speed rail stretches in the netherlands are a joke . 
  especially the ice stretch up to amsterdam . 
  i ca n't remember the train going over 120 km/h . 
  for the thalys connection to paris : has that train ever been running on time ?? 
  always account for a minimum delay of 1 hour , which takes the whole point of that high-speed connection away .

   the hardest imo is sch , i practise with scheveningen and schiphol and i 've been told i sound pretty good but saying it quickly and consistently is difficult . 
  the trick is to separate the * s * from * ch * . 
  doing the southern dutch variant will most probably be a easier , as they use the * ich-laut * ** \u00e7 ** , which is easier to make after an ** s ** . 
  the northern part uses a hardened * ach-laut * , ** x ** or ** \u0263 ** .
