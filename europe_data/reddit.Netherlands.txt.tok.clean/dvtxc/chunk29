  the policy excess of short-term healthcare has been increased to $ 385 during this cabinet , which was only $ 170 before . 
  the largest rise the policy has seen since its introduction in 2006 . 
  same accounts for flexible jobs . 
  the vvd has clearly been in the lead during the cooperation with labour . 
  they have been d66-like in their stances on european cooperation , which is not very surprisingly as they are in the same ep fraction ( alde ) . 
   the vvd was basically the same as d66 the last 4 years they tried to refuse any weed legalisation , the d66 has been pushing . 
  i would not call that d66-like . 
  it 's even more skewed if you take the campaign rhetoric of the right parties into consideration . 
  parties that used to swing between centre to centre-right ( cda ) and centre-right to right ( vvd ) took a considerable conservative turn in the last months of the election campaign to regain votes . 
  vvd : _ those who do n't act normal should leave the country _ , _ stress on stopping the immigration routes _ , _ stress intelligence services strength _ cda : _ remove double citizenship _ , _ national hymn at schools _ , _ reintroduce conscription _ a lot of people who were planning to vote for wilders , chose the vvd and cda at the very last moment , and wilders gained 5 seats nevertheless . 
  my apologies for the bit unclear picture . 
  i took this photograph from a newspaper .

  it 's hard to describe how an accent is perceived to someone of a different language , as description of the perception is strongly dependent on your own language . 
  i would say , it does not have a special connotation as far as i know , like harsh , cute , funny , or whatsoever . 
  though it is ` distinctive ' . 
  sometimes associated with * commanding * , though that 's more based on context and intonation . 
  the character * dr. doofenschmirtz * has a german accent in the dutch version of phineas and ferb , and characters with this ( usually exaggerated ) accent in other tv-series take on the same role/characteristics : weird and sometimes up to evil , but clumsy . 
  differences in pronunciation that tend to persist despite increasing proficiency is for example found in words containing * ei * , since this sound does not exist in german . 
  you 'd probably stick to the german pronunciation ** a\u02d0i ** , whereas we use ** \u025b\u031ei\u032f ** / ** \u025b\u026a ** , which is best described as a diphthong from your \u00e4 , ending in a i. 
  another sound that does not exist is found in words with * ui * , pronounced as ** \u0153y ** or ** \u0250y ** ( depending on region ) . 
  i think this is by far the hardest diphthong for germans to master . 
  for consonants , * ch * and * s * usually give away the accent . 
  * s * , can take three different pronunciations in german , whereas it is consistently a \u00df in dutch . 
  germans will however , quite often use ** \u0283 ** ( in e.g. 
  * st - * ) and ** z ** ( in e.g. 
  * so - * ) unconsciously . 
  for * r * , one gets closer by switching to the austrian * r * . 
  for * ch * one gets closer by switching to the swiss * ch * . 
  are n't those included in spain 's ? 
  _ `` cheers '' _ , when toasting . 
  comparable to german ` prost ', 
   i meant proost !, 
  good , now i can sleep in peace . 
  hahahahaha , i died . 
  sorry , my phone was tripping . 
  xd but ... anyways , you are sure you meant * proost * , are n't you ? 
   gerecht did you mean * proost * ? 
   gerecht did you mean * proost * ?

  hey , do n't steal our girls !, 
  [ the norwegians are doing that already ] ( https://youtu.be/qustqr9czdq ) . 
  unless ... an exchange can be arranged ( \u0361\u00ba \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00ba ), 
  i have got some german friends , and the times they read some dutch text , it sounded a bit similar to this . 
  though it is somewhat different for germans who actually learned dutch , which is usually nevertheless a quite recognisable accent as well . 
  this should become a thing . 
  anglosaxon-free cultural exchange of europe !, 
  i think because they had not received any instructions on pronunciation . 
  especially diphthongs and elongation rules of our vowels were bad , indeed , and were pronounced like they would have been pronounced in danish . 
  but i think , that if they had been given some instructions on typical diphthongs before , the could have fixed most of the mistakes . 
  omitting the pronunciation mistakes , it sounded like a fairly heavy germanish version of dutch with some english twist to it , added with swallowed syllables as we know them from danish . 
  sounded pretty germanish , best example : the word * leuk * pronounced more like / l\u0254\u026a\u032fk / instead of / l\u00f8k / . 
  though words with * - sen * , * - tie * , the / r / and / o : / sounds , and the swallowing of syllables gave away the danish accent , especially for the guy . 
  not entirely true . 
  if our fptp system was based on municipal level , [ there could still be more parties represented ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tnpzftu.png ) . 
  nevertheless , i still consider fptp to be ridiculous . 
  haha , busted the anonymous spender ? 
  :p thanks . 
  trust me , we are . 
  but the international media coverage differs vastly from the narrative in the netherlands . 
  whereas all international media talks about the victory against right-wing populism ( while our parliament got actually more right-wing ) , dutch media primarily talks about how labour got annihilated in this election . 
  furthermore , labour has lost some votes to denk in cities like rotterdam . 
  ( besides losing to groenlinks ), 
  seems to be very unlikely : in this very fragmented political landscape the centre to centre-right parties like d66 , cda and even christenunie will play a key role in coalition forming . 
  they have the key to form a majority and can exert pressure on the wing parties by saying they will join the other side , if they do n't get represented enough in the agreement . 
  i do n't expect a coalition without the cda to be very honest . 
  vvd and sp are never going to cooperate . 
   you voted against that horrible dijsselbloem he has often been called the most vvd-like member of labour . 
  used to be very industrialised but got a blow when the mines closed in the 60s and 70s . 
  especially the youth has been leaving that province to settle in the urbanised west instead . 
  it did . 
  pvv and vvd both got an extra seat with respect to prognosis from midnight , at the cost of groenlinks and christenunie . 
  seems to be . 
  centre-right coalition seems to be the most likely coalition . 
  it should be noted however that the parties have shifted significantly rightwards in a response to the pvv 's success in the polls . 
  cda and vvd have considerably toughened their stances on immigration to regain lost votes . 
  pvv usually gets more votes in the province of limburg . 
  would like to correct this : the hague , rotterdam , schiedam , almere tend to be pvv strongholds with a lot of immigrants of somali , moroccan and turkish descent . 
   the pvv and the fvd are strong in all german border regions . 
  the fvd is pro-legalisation of weed : [ source ] ( https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/standpunten/drugs ), 
  the pvv has always been doing very well in big cities like rotterdam , the hague and almere . 
  these cities , despite having a large population with immigrant background , have been strongholds for anti-immigration voices . 
  on the other hand , amsterdam , utrecht , and groningen are very left-progressive-leaning . 
  they have won in amsterdam . 
  results just came in . 
  we 're awaiting new national projections . 
  see the description i have given in the party descriptions . 
  mainly because of their cooperation with the vvd ( economically right wing , conservative liberals ), 
  counting only starts at 21h , no computers are allowed to calculate votes , we are bigger than austria , and there is a huge number of parties and participants . 
  28 parties , and 1114 candidates which can receive individual votes . 
  one actually has 1114 options when one goes to the polling station . 
  haha , well enschede is practically at the other side of the country for me ( zuid-holland ) . 
  if this is allowed by the mods : i am following the elections for fun , though it 's going to be a long night . 
  if you want , you can buy me a coffee for tomorrow : 19ocr8yng4gkhfai3muirgbbecxwdtrmdy  thank you for all the nice comments !!,
