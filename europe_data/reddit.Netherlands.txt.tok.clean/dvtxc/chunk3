  but has a lot of videos about our royal family as well . 
  so far , i can not remember our royal family ever cared about his ` insults ' , which i just regard as satire and humour . 
  yup , hear the same a lot . 
  and a lot of similarities can be drawn , especially concerning the kind of welfare state facilities and the way of living . 
  you might be more similar to us than the belgians even though they speak our language . 
  although , concerning your last phrases , i have to say that i 've met quite some danish people while i was studying abroad , and your language actually does sound like you guys have a hot potato stowed down your throat . 
  i have to agree with the swedes and norwegians on that . 
  sorry mate . 
  we recently had two referenda . 
  ( 2005 and 2016 ) one of them has been organised since 300,000 signatures had been collected , the amount needed to trigger a nation-wide referendum . 
  both of them concerning some eu-related subject and the results of both of them did n't appeal to the government . 
  now , they actually are planning to change this referendum law and most probably make it more restrictive . 
  hm , the stamp that implies that nuclear power is by all means something bad , distresses me as well . 
  ahh the times we still had hope in our neighbour 's chancellor ... 
  yes , that 's the distinction i 've tried to make . 
  i 've edited my post a bit . 
  yes , that 's true concerning the overall agreement . 
  trade parts have been put into force already ( provisional application ) , even though the netherlands has n't officially ratified the treaty yet . 
  the trade part of the treaty does n't necessarily have to be ratified by the european memberstates and , regardless of the referendum result , has already been put into force anyway . 
  which , of course , is a good deal . 
  you probably wo n't hear anybody complaining about more trade , unless you deliberately want to harm a country . 
  the association agreement in general , however , does of course and covers political and military cooperation as well . 
  concerning the current cold political relationship with russia it 's doubtful whether we should cooperate military or even promise defense support to ukraine if we want to prevent any further escalation . 
  this is not because we support current russian politics regarding ukraine , but more because it is not the best way to de-escalate this conflict . 
  the european union strives to expand its political and influential borders outwards , at any cost . 
  this is in my opinion the `` this will show em '' - attitude of the eu and the nato . 
  although the russian invasion of eastern parts of ukraine is unjustifiable in any way , it should be noted that a considerate part of the ukrainian population still feel themselves more russian than european . 
  or , at least , do rely on trade with russia . 
  it can not be denied that ukrainian economy is more based on ties with russia than with europe , especially the heavy industry in the donbass region . 
  this can not be transformed in a few years . 
  it 's easier for russia to cut off the trade than for ukraine . 
  it should , lastly , of course be noted that this referendum involves a lot of pro- or anti-eu sentiment . 
  we have seen how some corrupt regimes have demanded billions of euros to stay away from bankrupcy . 
  ( greece ) people are afraid that if we ( even without eu membership ) will tighten bonds with ukraine the same can happen . 
  after all , the association agreement assures financial support as well . 
  which is quite remarkable , as this indicates that this association agreement is much more profound than other agreements that have been made by the eu with other countries : compare the eu free trade agreements : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements the current association treaty also provides visa-free travelling for all ukrainian citizens , an opportunity which has been given to only a limited number of countries outside the eu , mostly because these countries have a reliable immigration and citizen registration system . 
  this is not restricted to our distrust in the ukrainian government . 
  the promised visa-free travel for turkish citizens is criticised by a lot of people as well . 
  yes , i have seen a broadcast from the ard from the program europa magazin concerning this referendum . 
  http://www.daserste.de/information/politik-weltgeschehen/europamagazin/sendung/niederlande-referendum-ukraine-100.html as i do speak german as well , the broadcast has actually been quite cringeworthy to see for me , as most opponents are seen as ` putin-freunde ' . 
  the same ` accusation ' is made in our media . 
  if you read up about this subject , i can assure you that public broadcasters at least are not the most reliable source of information . 
  i wo n't encourage you , of course , to read the entire association agreement , which exists of a mere 500 pages or so , although article 10 , 15 and 453 are an interesting read . 
  ** tl ; dr ** we do not oppose trade , a considerate part of the dutch people does , however , oppose the political expansion of europe and is anxious of making agreements with countries that are in war and are run by a corrupt government . 
  i would have no problems at all with this entire treaty if just some articles and especially promises are discarded . 
  the eu has promised some countries * cough greece * a lot in the past , but sometimes regreted these afterwards . 
  i do n't believe that people in the netherlands would have been so passionate about if it only revolved around a trade treaty . 
  which it does not . 
  it 's far more than that . 
  people actually have become passionate about it after the sheer monotonous media coverage our government has been pursuing . 
  ( mostly trying to persuade people to vote in favour of the association treaty ) it actually already can be seen in the difference of news coverage between public and commercial broadcasters . 
  the government 's intervention actually intensified the discussion between opponents and supporters . 
  opponents will most likely have two reasons to vote : this association treaty is actually damaging in a lot of ways and will not benefit us , and the second reason is : our government has shown to be incapable of taking a neutral stand in this discussion and clearly does not respect any anti-eu sound from its population . 
  i can understand if you 're in favour of this treaty ( which is not my opinion ) , if you actually are willing to go into discussion . 
  but it 's more the painful realisation that a distrust about this referendum exists . 
  we are being told that the majority of the population would be to ` dumb ' to have an opinion about this and thus should not be questioned . 
  it is a perfect example of the attitude politicians have towards lay people when it concerns european politics . 
  it 's even more pathetic to see how our government tries to block a no-vote . 
  the very party that made it possible to have referenda in our country has become scared now this referendum might turn out to show the people 's disapproval of the current state of the eu . 
  ( euroscepticism is on a record high in the netherlands , while the party that originally made it possible to organise referenda if enough signatures are collected is actually a very pro-eu party ) furthermore the trade treaty can not be blocked by the netherlands , it is the military and political cooperation with ukraine a lot of people do n't want . 
  a few more years and we 'll tax every ship passing through the north sea . 
  hehe , hamburg and bremen will hate us . 
  if you ca n't fight it , join it . 
  we will just make entire zeeland one big harbour !, 
   for our own self-interest . 
  it 's in europe 's interest to make africa a better place to live . 
  it is not . 
  it is in our own interest to have a stable outer region of europe , so countries at the outer border of europe do n't get destabilised . 
  however , the stability of , let 's say , central africa is ** not in our direct self-interest ** . 
  not having a well developed market with a high purchasing power can be in the self-interest of western companies , which would like to expand their market southwards , however , this is once again not in our direct self-interest . 
  it can be seen to be morally superior to provide the best living circumstances in africa , which in turn will undoubtedly lower the immigration to richer and more stable countries , such as in europe . 
  yet , the two aforementioned policies , * either dumping money in africa for our own self-interest * or * hermetically closing our southern border * , are not mutually exclusive and pose a false dichotomy . 
  it is important to understand the underlying cause of the instability in many african countries , and sometimes it is actually strikingly harsh to conclude that many countries are unstable due to no fault but their own . 
  this will even get worse if the people which actually posses the ability to change something in their country , flee . 
  apart from refugees that now come from war torn countries , such as syria and iraq , these people take a short cut to higher living standards abroad . 
  if this is the common work ethos of these people , than it 's quite clear to me why these countries do not improve . 
  an example to prove the multiplicity of the possible solutions , that prove your dichotomy false : the eu could hermetically close the southern border and at the same time intervene in african countries without constructing a southern pipeline transporting liquid gold to poor countries . 
  hermetically closing the southern border will cut through the positive feedback loop of migrant numbers , as the success stories of arriving refugees will halt . 
  it is the relatively high success rate , provided by our marine , that currently keeps the migration going . 
  secondly , if governments of african countries were n't that stubborn to cooperate in the development of the country , certain living standard could improve significantly . 
  in many cases this does not mean starting up foreign aid in financial forms , but let other countries overtake complete legislative parts , since that african country has not been able to develop those . 
  an example could be , [ outsourcing the education to a foreign company ] ( http://mgafrica.com/article/2016-03-31-liberia-plans-to-outsource-its-entire-education-system-to-a-private-company-why-this-is-a-very-big-deal-and-africa-should-pay-attention ) . 
  this could as well be a non-profit project : consider another country overtaking the education legislature of another country . 
  we have seen foreign aid growing over the past , yet in the end it came down to developed countries giving financial aid , which was redistributed by the local government . 
  throwing money in the sea can be seen more useful . 
   similar to how it was in western europe 's interest to integrate former warsaw pact countries in central and eastern europe into our political and economic structure ( eu ) . 
  i keep hearing that eastern european countries have seen an economical growth due to their incorporation in the european union , which i still find hard to believe . 
  yes , they have seen enormous growth , but most of the growth and reforms have been achieved before these countries joined the european union because [ they had to comply with the acquis legislation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_enlargement_of_the_european_union#progress_of_current_and_potential_candidate_countries ) before they could join . 
  furthermore , these countries have seen communism for 40 years , whilst a lot of these countries have seen comparable gdp to western countries before the world wars . 
  a lot of growth was due to the liberation from communism , and as some eastern european countries joined the eu 2004 , it has become as well an argument to joint the eu , yet some forget the difference between causality and correlation . 
   the eu investment and development funds were n't set up because western europeans felt like giving away money to the east , they were set up for mutual benefit . 
  economic development , increased trade , larger consumption of each other 's goods , greater prosperity , cross-border contacts . 
    this idea was conceived for the exact same reason . 
  without any chance of success considering the current geopolitical situation of many african countries . 
  as i said this minister forgets one major thing : the marshal plan was given ** after ** the war was over in europe . 
  just as financial aid was given to eastern european countries after they had been stabilised . 
  for example , i do not see serbia and bosnia joining the eu soon as they saw a devastating war just a little bit more than a decade ago . 
  i would describe the current geopolitical situation in many african countries at this moment [ ** anything but peaceful ** ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/ongoing_conflicts_around_the_world.svg/1000px-ongoing_conflicts_around_the_world.svg.png ) . 
  u/slusny _ cizinec has said in this thread there are three possible ways to tackle immigration from african countries , two of which would be to make either europe just as bad as africa , or to make africa just as good as europe . 
  considering this `` marshall plan '' of just pumping money on a large scale to a completely destabilised continent , i think we will achieve both of these scenarios and god may know where the average of those two living standard will be .
