  thank you . 
  it is not fraud . 
  it is just to fuck with statistics for fun . 
  i have tried that before , but it gets a little bit to crowded to read the labels easily in ascii format . 
  i have added a link to a page on which live results will be visible , including an interactive map with per municipality results . 
  i have added a live stream of the dutch public broadcaster , which will give updates on the election throughout the entire evening and night . 
  fixed . 
  i will provide the link in the main post at the locations which are currently occupied by placeholders . 
  results will be mentioned per municipality live by the public broadcaster nos at npo1 . 
  they will most likely post these results on [ nos.nl ] ( http://www.nos.nl ) as well . 
  though i would not call this website very reliable . 
  https://www.sgp.nl/ check it out on sunday . 
  they will have blocked the website , with a notification saying that sunday should be a resting day . 
  one party , sgp , even has a website that is unavailable on sundays . 
  there are local exit polls , which might represent a skewed prediction depending on the location . 
  the first national exit poll will become available at 21:00, 
  a lot of polling stations are at primary schools . 
  primary schools have a shorter day on wednesday . 
  furthermore , voting can be done between 7:30 and 21:00 , so if you did n't make it during office hours , there 's plenty of time to vote after work . 
  employers may even allow their employees to take time to vote on this day . 
  lastly , especially christian parties do not want to have elections on sunday . 
  the christian parties have the most loyal voter base . 
  though the ends of the political spectrum might benefit : groenlinks might benefit , as young voters tend to be more difficult to mobilise , but at the same time the pvv might profit from a higher turnout as well , due to the protest votes . 
  try euronews . 
  they dub all their broadcasts in english , spanish , french , german and russian, 
   why is your election on wednesday ? ... 
  i mean why not on saturday or sunday when most of the people are not working a lot of polling stations are at primary schools .

  lastly , especially christian parties do not want to have elections on sunday . 
   so , living in germany , and about to stalk your elections tonight . 
  are there any good websites that will fill in the seats in realtime ? 
  i will be giving the updates on the seat distribution from 21:00 cet onwards . 
  no official exit polls or prognoses are given before 21 o'clock , because they could influence the results . 
  polling stations close at 21 o'clock across the country . 
  some local exit polls may be published before . 
  i will put them in the liveblog at the bottem of the post . 
  you can follow the elections on the website of the public broadcaster , [ nos.nl ] ( http://www.nos.nl ) , or the big newspapers like [ nrc.nl ] ( http://www.nrc.nl ) , [ volkskrant.nl ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl ) , and [ ad.nl ] ( http://www.ad.nl ), 
  random fact : did you know he was wearing a bullet-proof vest at the tv debate ? 
  even their voice is represented by our very christian conservative sgp party . 
  thank you very much !, 
  keep an eye on this thread from 21:00 cet onwards . 
  i will update that graph live with the latest prognoses and exit polls !, 
  because christian parties do n't want to have elections on a sunday . 
  tomorrow , when polling stations close at 21:00 , the first prognosis will be published ( based on exit polls ), 
  thank you !, 
  stay updated tomorrow , at 21 o'clock for live updates on the prognosis . 
  ( and yes , that ascii graph is going to be updated live ! ), 
  no , the elections start tomorrow at 7:30, 
  elections are tomorrow . 
  certain fragments have been featured by various news outlets . 
  whole debates are rarely translated . 
   would you recommend any newspaper as well ? 
  usually the [ nrc ] ( http://www.nrc.nl ) has great interactive infographics on these topics . 
  i will update the thread , tomorrow . 
   first live results will be expected from 21h . 
   awesome thread , and really informative . 
  thank you !, 
    i have to ask , is wilders ' hair real ? 
  it looks a bit like one of those 18th century wigs . 
  yes , it is , as far as i know . 
  fixed the typo . 
  did you know that the danish royal family is connected to the dutch royal family ? 
  i see possibilities ... 
  underrated comment . 
  though i think most non-dutchies wo n't get the joke . 
  greek 10 % fat yoghurt with honey and with walnuts with their skin removed . 
  greek yoghurt  turkish yoghurt ? 
  flair up , mate !, 
   we always see the shouting ones . 
  i have heard this rhetoric way too often , while it is just a symptom of leftist amnesia . 
  the netherlands have [ seen the biggest support for the akp ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/11/01/turkse-akp-van-erdogan-stevent-af-op-absolute-meerderheid-a1411841 ) in the turkish general elections of 2015 , [ far bigger than the akp support in other countries ] ( http://www.metronieuws.nl/nieuws/binnenland/2016/04/nergens-zoveel-steun-voor-erdogan-als-in-nederland ) . 
  the thousand protesters of tonight is just a small fraction of those who sympathise with a dictator who longs to the old turkification processes the republic had seen in the beginning of the 20th century . 
  i have seen dutch-turkish friend 's profile pictures turn into turkish flags or faces painted in the turkish colours on days of protest against opposition fractions . 
  the very fact that a single event sparks the patriotism of these turks , that just happen to have a dutch passport as well , is a sign of an underlying problem . 
  they would chose turkey over the netherlands , no matter what generation immigrant they are . 
  this was acknowledged first around the 2000s and the debates of the upcoming election still revolve around the same topic . 
  almost two decades which could have been utilised to improve integration , have been left unused . 
  you can always open a short call . 
   screaming turkish stuff with quite some chanting _ allahu akbar _ . 
  -- tl : dr * turkish fm 's landing rights were revoked in the morning . 
  * in a response , we have been called nazis and fascistic * minister of family affairs tried to enter the country by car instead * we said no again * she reached rotterdam anyways , but was stopped once she got close to the consulate * there 's been a 4 hours stalemate between the minister and her guards and the police * special police units ( anti-terrorism division ) were brought in , just in case the situation would escalate * minister 's car got towed away * minister had to be excorted back to germany by force . 
  a column of about 12 cars and a following helicopter made sure she actually crossed the border again . 
  * meanwhile , about ~ 1000 were protesting in rotterdam with turkish flags near the turkish consulate * the near vicinity of the consulate had been closed , some have tried to breach the barricades * twelve people got arrested , seven wounded * we 're awaiting the next turkish phallic accusation . 
   pvda could get a boost in voters maybe in the municipal elections for the actions by aboutaleb . 
  but definitely not in the general elections . 
  [ ** video : ** these guys bring in the heavy equipment ] ( https://twitter.com/nos/status/840694878766022657/video/1 ) the guards of the turkish minister are armed . 
  special police units are entering the surroundings of the consulate , in case the situation escalates . 
  [ ** pictures ** ] ( https://twitter.com/bobhgl/status/840700346213253126/photo/1 ), 
   there are a lot of turks and plenty enough that are not . 
  i have heard there is another country with a lot of beaches right next to turkey that could use some foreign money . 
  i have been told by a turkish friend that trt t\u00fcrk stresses the fact that the pkk rally in rotterdam was allowed a few months ago , whereas an official representative of the turkish government is not granted permission to visit the consulate . 
   anyhow , i do n't think any of those people are getting in . 
  fvd 's chances of getting even more than one seat are growing . 
  yes, 
  denmark sees the area of its arable land increasing . 
  this map forgets something crucial : the huge post-glacial isostatic rebound greenland could see , if it lost its ice sheet . 
  the depression in the middle is formed by the current ice weight , though could get fully above sea level after glacial isostatic adjustment . 
  a good example of a country that is still gaining land because of this very process is [ ** finland ** ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/suomi_jaakauden_jalkeen.png ) and to a lesser extent also sweden .
