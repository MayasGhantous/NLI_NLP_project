  these expressions occur more frequently in more formal writing . 
  especially in the southern regions , the feeling for word gender and word function is stronger . 
  for me , as someone who has been raised bilingually with a language that extensively uses cases , cases come quite natural and i somehow do not understand how they have been gradually abandoned in the dutch language . 
  technically the dutch language still has 4 cases , and yes one is expected to know how to use them during the finals or an official application letter . 
  and some of them can be even found in daily use .

  may i remind you that you are commenting on an article about the ** german ** afd party ? 
  furthermore , anti-eu sentiments can be found on both sides of the political spectrum . 
  i take the netherlands as an example , where 2 hard-eurosceptic parties exist ( * sp * and * pvv * ) . 
  one of them on the far-left , another one on the far-right . 
  this number might even increase to 3 or 4 after the elections . 
  in addition to that , we have two soft-eurosceptic parties ( * cu * , * pvdd * ) . 
  once again , the first on the conservative side , the latter on the green progressive side .

  he 's been seriously explaining all my sarcastic comments here on reddit as well up to the point i recognise his username by now . 
  as far as my knowledge goes on this topic : reclaimed land sinks . 
  especially the top layer is very soft and not suited to support the structures ' weight over time . 
  it shrinks as the water content decreases after reclamation . 
  even certain highways and our equivalent to the bundesstra\u00dfen get rebuild with foundation pillars , making our roads one of the costliest in europe . 
  [ this is a nicely illustrated cross section of our roads and railways ] ( https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/download/attachments/112166128/paalmatras-kaftillustratie-cur226.jpg?version=1&amp;modificationdate=1427099950000&amp;api=v2 ) . 
  we try to reach the harder soil layer at deeper locations , which should solve most of the problems . 
  but this also plays a role on larger scale : not only do we get lower as time progresses with respect to the sea level because the sea level rises , we actually sink in absolute height . 
  [ these are the rates at which the elevation changes over a century . 
  ] ( http://www.natuurinformatie.nl/sites/ndb.mcp/contents/i000877/figuur%204.jpg ) as you can see , some places might end up more than half a meter lower by the end of this century . 
  some side notes on this map : not all elevation changes are caused by sinking soil . 
  the dark blue spots in the north east are due to gas extraction . 
  the gas reservoirs tend to collapse partially , causing surface depression alongside earthquakes . 
  furthermore , a part of the sinking and tilting is caused at a deeper level : the euroaziatic tectonic plate is still reaching its equilibrium after the last ice age . 
  ( called [ * post-glacial rebound * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post-glacial_rebound ) ) whereas [ fennoscandia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/suomi_jaakauden_jalkeen.png ) rises because of this , the dutch part of this plate sinks , with denmark acting as pivot point . 
  but there are many more problems with reclaimed land , such as a gradual soil salinity . 
  as salt water has been removed or replaced with fresh water , salt gradually moves toward the surface ( comparable to diffusion ) causing soil salinity . 
  so ... pls . 
  gib land for survival, 
  oh we could piss off the greens as well : it would be shame if we used the newly reclaimed north sea land to build tall skyscrapers that took all the wind out of the german wind turbine parks . 
  we could sell you our plentiful natural gas as a compensation for the colder days at a discount tariff .

   even then there were dutch speakers who did n't like french sounding words too much haha , the dutch removing baguettes since the 17th century . 
   the renaissance humanists also made conscious efforts to enrich the language with influences from classical languages . 
  99 % of the dutch still do n't know how to properly use ** zij ** / ** hun ** / ** hen ** . 
  as introduced by these humanists and still in use in contemporary official grammar . 
  wow , thanks for the long post . 
   ( edit : in fact , i believe you can often se this distinction clarly if you go looking for words where the modern spelling of the german word that shares the same proto-germanic root uses `` u '' vs `` o '' - buch =  bok , doch =  dog , auch =  ogs\u00e5 ; this does not hold for * tog * right ? 
  - de : * buch * --  no : * bok * ( pronounced with long / u : / ) de : * zug * --  no : * tog * ( pronounced with short / o / ) e.g. 
  : in a phrase like * ` bok om tog ' * ( book on trains ) , i have the feeling i have to guess whether it is going to be a short or a long vowel . 
  all o 's are followed by only one consonant , yet the pronunciations differ . 
  then apparently words like * foster , ost , gjort , lort , sort * all have a long / u / pronunciation , yet they end on two consonants . 
  ( and * post * and * kost * are short / o / again ) yeah , i have heard some people in for example nordland might be better able to understand swedish than the folks from bergen just because the dialects differ so much . 
  sometimes this happens even on a smaller scale . 
  it makes me think though : what dialect do tv presentors speak ? 
  have a look at russian . 
  all texts on signs , tv programmes , are all caps . 
  even when they do use lower-case letters , they are very similar to the upper-case letters anyway . 
  * \u03bd * = poisson 's ratio * \u03c3 * = stress * \u03b5 * = strain * e * = young 's modulus * \u03b4 * = infinitesimal length for integration * \u03b8 , \u03c6 * = angle - definitely mechanics ... 
   with a bunch of extra consonants thrown in ~ ~ to confuse matters . ~ ~ * to guide the rather strict pronunciation of the syllables to prevent ambiguous orthography like in english * ftfy  now , explain me why * bok * has an / u / sound and * og * has a / \u0254 / sound in norwegian . 
  or why the * g * is not pronounced at all in that word . 
  i have been in denmark , norway and sweden . 
  reading was most times not the biggest problem after a while . 
  understanding spoken language ( especially danish ) is something different . 
  i have to say though , i had the ability to include my english and german proficiency in the efforts to read the scandinavian languages . 
  somehow , all the nordic countries have some phallic-related shape . 
  * advanced humor for mature people , 
   just look at number 9 ( viken ) . 
  they took a slight detour around the orange blob ( oslo , simultaneously a county and a municipality , ) in order to ensure that the new county is linked by a land bridge . 
  ca n't they just call it ` greater oslo ' , or * osloomr\u00e5det * ? 
  excuse me for my bad norwegian if that name does not make sense . . :p, 
   that 's `` flatland '' . 
  phew ... we dodged that nickname . 
  i guess , loan words have remained closer to their greek original in dutch , whereas comparable loan words in english have been `` latinised '' before ( usually through latin  french ) . 
  words that come to my mind are ** historicus ** - * historikos * ( compare the more romance word * historian * ) , or ** kamer ** - * kamara * ( compared to * chamber * ) . 
  nevertheless , most words with greek origin are the same in english , so i am quite surprised as well . 
  given how relatively easy it is to ** read ** danish/norwegian and to a bit lesser extent swedish , without prior knowledge , i would have expected dutch to be a bit closer to the scandinavian languages . 
  certainly closer than greek .
