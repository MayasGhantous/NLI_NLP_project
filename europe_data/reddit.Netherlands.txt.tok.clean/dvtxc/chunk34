  so , i would get a real and cheap gasoline next door ? 
  i would n't mind . 
   pineapple and ham this is what i was looking for . 
  it 's about the combination . 
  ~ ~ pineapple ~ ~ ananas and ham . 
  some countries had mandatory voting in the past . 
  ( the netherlands had until the 70s ), 
  the moment i read ` seeds ' , * life of boris * channel came to my mind . 
   it 's structural problems that need to be tackled ; migration , ** social inequality , terrorism , poverty ** , etc. 
  this `` sending message '' thing is nice , but all alone it 's about as useful as standing at a trainstation holding a sign saying `` refugees welcome '' and then going home as if nothing had happened . 
  i have seen this so often , but this is ** not ** the reason why there is a potential for right-wing parties in the netherlands . 
  because if it was , this would not explain the surge of more conservative right-wing political sounds in the 90s and 00s in the netherlands , before the economic crisis , before the mass-immigration influx across the mediterranean , before the terrorist attacks in london , madrid , paris , berlin , heck even before 9/11 . 
  instead , i would look at the social segregation in immigrant neighbourhoods , the small crimes , the changed living climate by futile yet repetitive vandalism ( again in mostly immigrant neighbourhoods ) ... 
  these problems have not been tackled and are experienced by people on a far more regular basis . 
  the amount of social security that flows toward some groups , e.g. 
  the many fruitless attempts to improve the living standards in some problematic neighbourhoods , e.g. 
  the grounds that are brought up now by anti-immigration populists bear a lot less logic . 
  terrorism ? 
  apart from how terrible the incidents are , the chance still remains smaller than being struck by lightning twice in one year . 
  becoming a victim of intimidation , harassment ? 
  real : depending on how your odds are , it can even be during daytime . 
  and can we please agree , that the existence of these areas should not be accepted anymore in a country like the netherlands ? 
  this was done in the most germany-leaning and most german accent speaking province of the netherlands . 
  he should try to do this in rotterdam ... 
  does have a slight chance of ending up with [ gone wrong ] tags . 
  ( depending on whether he would encounter some football chavs ), 
  i knew it !, 
  maybe i am asking the irrelevant questions , but i am legitimately interested in what kind of people make up the 2 % of the gr\u00dcnen that approve the policy and the 8 % of the afd that disapprove the policy . 
   the ranking was broken down into three categories -- culture , creativity , and value -- and looked at the ratio of trend-setting and creative industry indicators ( such as independent coffee shops , vintage fashion stores , independent bike shops , co-working spaces and art galleries/studios ) to the number of residents . 
  penalty points were subtracted for areas that had high numbers of big chain brands such as starbucks , costa and pret a manger . 
  this seems to be completely arbitrary . 
  furthermore , [ a look at their website ] ( https://www.travelsupermarket.com/en-gb/holidays/city-breaks/hip-hangout-guide/ ) indicates that the amount of gravity is a ruling factor as well . 
   exarchia is famous as a home to greek anarchists o god . 
  since when is their presence being regarded as ` cool ' ? 
  poor serbia . 
  does not get mentioned , but kosovo and montenegro do . 
   what was fortuyn like ? 
  way better than wilders . 
  fortuyn used better argumentation to defend his stances . 
  he was well-spoken and had a broader campaign and party election programme . 
  the television debates in which he participated were definitely more enjoyable . 
  wilders ignores debates , falling back to his rhetoric that those debates or television shows are directed against him or just part of ` elite ' . 
  for his time , some regarded him as a ` far-right ' ( which is kinda ironic , as he had been a member of the labour party before ) or as a ` anti-immigration populist ' . 
  as an example : [ a poster ] ( http://www.carelbrendel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image280.jpg ) of the extreme-left organisation internationale socialisten [ spread in 2001 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/rotterdamgwburgerplein060502.png ) , with the text : * `` stop the dutch haider '' * , referring to [ j\u00f6rg haider ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b6rg_haider ) from the austrian fp\u00d6 . 
  though , fortuyn 's style of speaking could be used by any kind of right-of-the-centre party from this time . 
  it is not that much different from the contemporary vvd rhetoric , which recently ruled out any cooperation with wilders , as they find him too extremistic . 
  a politician openly questioning our immigration policy and the position of the islam within the society was perhaps just more shocking in 2001 . 
  this is why anti-immigration sounds might stay in the netherlands . 
  many other populist parties in other countries have risen after the terrorist attacks in europe or the recent mass immigration influx . 
  the netherlands has been familiar with a popular conservative stance toward immigration since the 90s and 00s , due to our experience with social segregation within immigrant neighbourhoods . 
  the potential for anti-immigration parties has not disappeared ever since . 
  unfortunately , it has been used by mostly pale copies of their spiritual predecessor , mostly radicalised and dumbed down in credibility . 
  the most recent one being geert wilders and most dutch people will still remember the cringe-worthy performances by rita verdonk as well . 
  i am a simple redditor . 
  i see the netherlands having a higher score than finland . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnfhwgzwd4 with english subs . 
  the way i think it is : at a regular intersection , quite a lot of drivers are standing still with running engine . 
  furthermore , you have to accelerate from zero . 
  you rarely come to full stop at a roundabout , unless it 's very busy or there are quite a lot of cyclists . 
  you just slow down back to either second or third gear , which is still more fuel efficient than accelerating from a full stop . 
  dutch road design is the thing i will miss most when i will ever plan to leave the country . 
  the bike lanes , the clear intersections , the very clear threefold redundantly coded priority rules at intersections and the ultrasmoothly finished highway tarmac . 
  we still spend a relatively small amount on [ infrastructure as percentage of our gdp ] ( http://s30.postimg.org/5fkf3lxn5/infrastructure_spending.png ) . 
  ( bike infrastructure not included ), 
  please stop . 
  my ocd can not handle this . 
  ** i only recently found out it is actually czechian . 
  great show for sure !, 
  i have heard it was not a success in germany , as apparently germans do n't like to see everything go wrong . 
  that 's why they stopped after the fourth episode . 
  it 's worse . 
  an amendment to rule out the hacking possibility of devices that could harm the body integrity ( such as hacking of pacemakers , or even possible brain-computer interfaces , etc. . . ) has been rejected . 
  in principle , this law states that the intelligence services are allowed to breach in , read , or manipulate personal medical devices . 
  i have seen some quite convincing tv appearances of hiddema . 
  i doubt he 's an actual politician , but he certainly knows how to carefully explain his stances . 
  i ca n't take roos serious . 
  i hope the fvd will get , say , two or three seats , just so they wo n't be forgotten . 
  once they 're a member of the parliament , they might have a chance to stay as a party , otherwise people will quickly forget about them in the coming years . 
   some tax loopholes ( you like that do n't you ) ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) we need luxembourg though , to complete it . 
  further development of the rotterdam and antwerp sea ports could be a huge boost . 
  currently , the city of antwerp relies on dutch authorities to maintain the vertical clearance and keep the entrance to their seaport clean . 
  ( it silts up all the time due to sandy depositions ), 
  well ... jokes aside , the flemish people i have met have always been really nice . 
  i can say there are some differences in mentality , though they are very minor . 
  especially if you compare the differences on e.g. 
  a european scale . 
  we might be a bit more closed , stingier and a bit more straight-forward than the flemish . 
  though , the shared languages does create some interconnectivity . 
  this feeling is even stronger in southern provinces of the netherlands , such as noord-brabant and limburg . 
  some tv-shows are broadcast in both countries and the countries are quite often referred to as ` southern ' or ` northern ' neighbour respectively in the news . 
  and ... ** we need their football team . 
  a genuine question would be : what are we going to do with the monarchy/ies ? 
  * abolish the monarchy ? 
  * arranged marriage between the princes and princesses ? 
  / s * k.u.k. 
  / dual monarchy ? 
  i think it does . 
  we have seen a lot of maps that caused divisiveness on r/europe . 
  this is the first step toward maps that promote unity in europe !, 
   the aivd still needs permission from a minister in order to access the data .
