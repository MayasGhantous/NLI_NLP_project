  t they do not . 
  this requested amendment has been rejected . 
  it such a pity that the parties that rejected this idiotic intelligence proposal , at the same time support the southern migrant influx of potential harmful individuals , err wait , almost overprotect every them ... why is there no sane compromise that fights the roots of radicalisation , yet respects the rights of its citizens ? 
  this actually angers me . 
  the following groups and institutions have expressed their concerns regarding this proposal : * ** raad van state ** * ( council of state ) * , the highest constitutionally established advisory body to the dutch government , has ruled this proposal to be conflicting with the european convention on human rights ( by the european council ) . 
  * four ( ex - ) courts of the dutch supreme court of the netherlands have said this proposal should not be allowed in its current form * privacy pressure groups ( bits of freedom ) * technology experts all advices have been neglected . 
  the dutch government is literally neglecting the highest courts and all experts in order to spy on its own citizens . 
  we laugh on trump , on how he fights the jurisdiction . 
  the so politically correct labour party does exactly the same over here . 
  it took me some time to realise that the rate of change axis runs into negative values as well . 
  * estonians : finnish speaking russians that can not into nordic . 
  there . 
  i said it . 
  * iceland : danish fishing colony * faroese : danish sheep f * ckers * greenlanders : depressed suicidal eskimos . 
  also , denmark, 
  * danes : unintelligible racist swedes * finns : drunk mud-bathing eastern swedes * norwegians : rich western swedes spending their money in sweden * swedes : poor lads earning their money in western sweden i think i triggered all the nordic countries with this post . 
  do n't crucify me pls . 
  this article was already posted on this sub yesterday : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tfglf/what_to_expect_from_the_dutch_elections_in_six/ why the need for the editorialised title ? 
  ( which might be untrue , since the labour party has performed consistently better than the polls indicated in the last three elections ), 
  til, 
  wow , i have never seen such an extended form of the [ ** baker-schut plan ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:bakker_schut-plan.png ), 
  in austria , every bike is a mountain bike . 
  over here , the most bikes are just regular city or so-called `` granny '' bikes , or even fixed gear bikes . 
  i do n't think so ... 
  either stolen or they will break down after a few weeks . 
  send help . 
  but yes , new bikes get  $ 500 really fast . 
   if you want some gears and a good frame , prepare for 4-digit prices . 
  sorry , i do n't want to buy into the pvv but this comment is utterly ridiculous . 
   science source ? 
   culture source ? 
  he wants to preserve culture . 
  though he would like to turn down unnecessary subsidies to certain organisations . 
   all mosques and send police to people 's houses to take away their qurans ** not ** true , he confirmed this [ on sunday morning in an interview at wnl ] ( https://twitter.com/wnlopzondag/status/830683405771821058 ) . 
  he will not force the ban , he proposed a symbolic ban and ban on distribution like has been done with _ mein kampf _ . 
  he would permit the use for academic use and would not enforce the ban in people 's homes . 
   we 'd instantly jump to the top of the isis most hated countries list on isis ' list for sure . 
  but what do you want to say with that ? 
  we would be loved by them if we turned our country into a caliphate ? 
  [ that 's not a fun fact ] ( http://daskapital.nl/images/other/averageprice.png ) =(, 
   byzantion ftfy, 
  one more reason to visit that town again !, 
  al those people living on the one of the most tectonic active regions of europe , housing millions in fast and sometimes illegally built flats . 
  how is this not asking for a major catastrophe ? 
  it looks like they have mounted baskets on the back . 
  what 's this abomination of our stolen bikes ? 
  dutch bikes do n't have baskets on the back !, 
  well , those areas in the western part of poland look like they can be densified a bit as well ... 
  i do n't think poland would mind that much , since it is polska a anyway , right ? 
  ladoga lake seems to be to cool to boil ... 
  yeah , we could really use some * lebensraum * , do n't you think ? 
  i should not have clicked that link . 
  heard the euro 2016 song ... . . =(, 
  do n't forget to include the border patrolls the populists so deeply desire , [ ** it 's going to be great ** ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ae/4f/97/ae4f974043f68744b022b6755f5ab178.jpg ) !, 
  5 border crossings to get to your nearest hospital . 
  tame your viking instincts , will you ? 
  there 's no oil near faroe anymore . 
  i have been there , it 's certainly a great town to visit . 
  just as its surroundings !, 
  and thank god they speak german over there , so i could at least ask for directions and get the right stuff in the pharmacy once . 
  but bavaria germany is best germany , is n't it ? 
  ** ducks before angry berliners come after me *, 
  you should head over to the / r/the _ schulz for that . 
  as u/marktplatz once said , this is not really the place to post * hohe energie * posts . 
  this subreddit is great to talk ** about ** politics , but not to explicitly campaign ** in favour ** of a certain politician . 
  seems to be the regular prices of a dutch house as well . 
  and it 's almost all terraced over here . 
  we did . 
  we have built quite some new coal plants in the last ten years , though the new design can accommodate a installation that catches the carbondioxide emissions and will reroute the emission to empty natural gas reservoirs underground . 
  we still pump up a lot of natural gas from the north sea ( do n't deny you have been doing a lot with oil  ) , and once they are empty , we can use some of the empty reservoirs to store carbiondioxide emissions . 
  got ta practice my trump imitation skills . 
  i might earn something with it . 
  it 's going to be a circus for sure . 
  already when forming a coalition . 
  we have laughed at the belgians for not being able to form a government [ for more than a year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%e2%80%9311_belgian_government_formation ) . 
  but i think we wo n't see a coalition this year either . 
  because the latin alphabet actually does not really fit many slavic languages very well . 
  a lot of things are called * erasmus - * in rotterdam . 
  * erasmus mc ( academic hospital ) * erasmus university rotterdam * erasmusbrug ( this bridge ) * erasmuslijn ( a metro line ) * erasmiaans gymnasium ( high school ) * erasmusspeldje ( an award ) * erasmushuis ( an office building ), 
  well , r/the _ schulz is leaking . 
  this way they can implicitly post memes . 
  fuuu, 
  agreed , let 's rename it to [ ** albion ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albion ) again . 
  i have seen quite some people browsing reddit during lunch break or during lectures and i know some friends ' reddit usernames as well . 
   ( and no , i am not into anime ), 
  * does that then also mean that dutch becomes an officially allowed language in r/europe ? 
  can i just say here that i find that the scottish parliament has the most beautiful and simultaneously bad-ass looking interior of all european parliaments ? 
  modern wood and glass combination with a semi-circular formation . 
  it looks great !, 
   should n't have been accepted by his professors op grond waarvan ? 
   both baudet and hiddema have previously expressed sympathy towards pvv , and said they voted for the pvv . 
  this distancing makes it more difficult for wilders to find qualified people to fill his seats . 
  in that case , i hope the * fvd * will get through the 0.67 % barrier and gets at least a seat , providing a more intellectual sound from this area of the political spectrum . 
  history learns that parties who do n't get a seat are quickly forgotten . 
  a part of the potential * pvv * voters actually disagree with the extremes wilders is looking for and could fall back to either * vvd * or , in this case , the * fvd * if he goes too far . 
   that 's because only 1 person has ever been a member of the pvv , and that is wilders . 
  it 's a 1 man party . 
  yeah i know . 
  i meant * puppet members * . 
  there have been no puppet members that left for the * fvd * .
