  just some puppet members that left for the * vnl * and now have lunatic stances as getting the netherlands an aircraft carrier . 
  0 . o like from all things on earth , an aircraft carrier is the least we need at the moment . 
  even germany does not have one . 
  the ** fvd ** developed largely independently from the ** pvv ** . 
  most of its members have never been a member of the pvv as far as i know . 
  some party members who disagreed with the pvv stances and lack of professionalism of wilders left for the ** vnl ** , which continues to be marginal party and actually still is a mere * pvv 2.0 * , with a top candidate i can not take serious either . 
  5 polls and the aggregate average of those polls . 
  [ ** original ** from oct , 16th 2009 ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2017/02/gettyimages-91933602-1024x596.jpg&amp;w=1484 ) [ ** photoshopped picture ** from oct , 17th 2009 ] ( http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/669391/a602623d/pechtold_was_gisteren_in_londen.html ) those signs are not fake . 
  edit : fixed links, 
  just some extra information , not given by the article from washingtonpost : the photoshopped image has also been circulating the webs since 2009 and was not created by wilders himself . 
  he reused this image , which first appeared on a , so to say , dutch variant of imgur/youtube , which is actually more popular than youtube over here . 
  [ ** photoshopped picture ** from oct , 17th 2009 ] ( http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/669391/a602623d/pechtold_was_gisteren_in_londen.html ) furthermore : this has been a key topic in literally every news or talk show for the rest of the day . 
  wilders got more airtime in one day than most of his rivals get in a month . 
  think about who profited from this . 
   i do n't know . 
  why do you ? 
  dutch news : * on the recently discovered security flaws in our vote counting system : * we should always be aware , since other countries , like you know ... russia , could manipulate it . 
  * * on the recent photoshop gate on twitter between two politicians : * we should always be aware , since other countries spread photoshopped images as well , like you know ... maybe russia * * there 's a lot of fake news in the upcoming campaign : * but who does actually benefit from this fake news ? 
  well , could be populist parties , but could also be someone else , like you know ... maybe russia *, 
  ` not ' in russian : * \u043d\u0435 * ` no ' in russian : * \u043d\u0435\u0442 * pronounced as ** / n\u02b2et / ** , containing a sort-of diphthong . 
  the dutch ` not ' , * niet * does n't even come close to russian pronunciation , since the * ie * just forms an elongated * i * , as in ** / i / ** . 
  it 's the same as the german * ie * . 
  we use , also just like in german , quite often the short form * nie * in fast speech . 
  ( dropping the t ), 
  at least one can infer the pronunciation from the letters . 
  yes , but i actually meant the first two phrases . 
  they are identical , yet always considered to be different languages , because ... balkan nationalism, 
  op is omniscient . 
  so close  but if one just learned the * ikke * and * ingen * anomalies , the languages would be pretty close . 
  ^ ( ^ * eenander * ^ is ^ posh ^ and ^ a ^ bit ^ archaic , ^ * elkaar * / * elkander * ^ is ^ used ^ more ^ often ), 
  [ ** it must go up an octave in the end of the phrase . 
  ** ] ( https://youtu.be/osacz4ghqjs?t=219 ) otherwise it 's not norwegian . 
  similarity of etymology . 
  no problem , [ ** russians use the same technique anyway ** ] ( https://youtu.be/5wkloovm2yo?t=271 ), 
  [ ** example of a cigarette package ** ] ( https://i.redd.it/m7tzviizt48y.jpg ), 
   it sounds basically same as dutch ** triggered *, 
  damn february manages to cause divisiveness everywhere . 
  february is different between * croatian and bosnian and serbian ( like how ??? ), 
  * czechian and slovakian * finnish and estonian * russian and belarusian, 
  because it 's actual dutch . 
  i do n't get his joke . 
  have an upvote . 
  better watch out with that albanian mafia . 
  this is true for all scandinavian languages , as someone who speaks dutch , english and german fluently . 
  it 's a mashup of those , with a lot of false friends . 
  kloana . 
  haha , did n't want to copy / u/victorvan 's work . 
   a few years back that actually hit me ... damn , already 3 yrs . 
  ah , i did n't even pay attention to the flair on mobile . 
   great way to begin my day  16:20, 
   you can read dutch wikipedia articles but , why ? 
  they are shit . 
  because old-english was pretty much old-dutch/frisian ( with some danish influence , due to the viking raids . ), 
  only after the 12th century or so , the english language got heavily influenced by french . 
   and german is n't that useful outside of germany/austria/switzerland . 
  french and german are more useful than english in italy . 
  speaking from personal experience . 
  the same holds for many balkan countries . 
  haha , then you will be considered to be an austrian , i guess ... as they end a lot of words with * - ln * , which is the bavarian/austrian form of * - lein * , but used way more often . 
  but true . 
  every tree smaller than a house is already a * b\u00e4umchen / boompje * for me . 
  every cup that 's not a king size beverage container is already a * t\u00e4sschen / kopje * . 
  this slice of life comment made me laugh more than it should have ... xd, 
  it 's a statutory in the netherlands as well . 
  the length depends on the subjects one chooses , but everyone has german for a minimum of 3 yrs . 
   it 's just that you constantly chew on ~ ~ `` royal dansk '' cookies ~ ~ ** potatoes ** and ca n't be bothered to swallow them before you speak . 
  [ ** ftfy ** ] ( https://satwcomic.com/art/language-lesson.jpg ), 
  the language of the * mount doom * surroundings . 
  well , [ ** the last time i posted a map here ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5j5sg6/9_ways_to_divide_the_netherlands/ ) , this whole sub actually blew up . 
  actually i do , as ( 1 ) * flemish * is not a language , ( 2 ) they actually speak proper dutch . 
  `` oh , you want first-time unprotected sex ? 
  * '' will work out just fine . 
  yes , i know . 
  i have been told that by most germans . 
  but at least , a dutch attempting to speak proper german is quite often considered to be * cute * , so i can live with that . 
  i think there might be some other cross-flagged neighbours that would agree on this map . 
  ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ true . 
   so the finns patent ~ ~ a novel use of whale oil ~ ~ the 3310 design and wap internet ftfy, 
  do n't worry , this graph must be alternative statistics . 
  ftfy . 
  i could still hear that potato . 
  do n't worry , upon reinstallation of the _ new netherlands _ we will take a big safe margin around the old borders ... what about the states ny , nj , pa , ct , ma , de , md ? 
  [ ** if citizen satisfaction increases ** ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/family/raise-worlds-happiest-children-time-went-dutch/ ) , we can add some more . 
   2 mad men from dresden and linz, 
  i am actually interested in finland 's response ... 
  ah , so that 's how we can restore this trump problem : we just make america dutch again !, 
  the question that arises for me when i look at this graph is : what is considered to be an equality index worth aspiring to ? 
  as much as i do support government secured access to good health care and education , i also support the reduction of tardy and big governments and favour a bit more economic liberal governance . 
  these graphs seem to implicitly state that * perfect equality * is an ideal society . 
  a bit like the communist hail state , which actually frightens me a bit . 
  almost everyone would agree that the far-end on the right is a bad state , yet no formulation by the gini scaling is provided on how far one should go to the left . 
  if you can read dutch , [ here you are . 
  just to give some nuance : as soon as those rebels ( by western media often referred to as unified opposition ) defeat a piece of is territory , some start to fight between each other . 
  as much as i would like to see is defeated , you have to realise a lot of militant factions do exactly the same when they meet each other . 
  so by that logic we should separate a whole lot more people over there , if we want to prevent to be accused of provoking murder ... 
  ** clarification ** : cancelling a passport does ** not ** make a person stateless , as nationality is not revoked : they just can not travel anymore and are not able to identify themselves . 
  ** personal opinion ** : good !, 
  now look whether they have a second nationality and complete the process . 
  we do not need people with these intolerant and backwards views in our society .
