  [ ** statutory berlin copypasta ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kopiernudeln/comments/5ka7ql/ach_berlin_was_ist_berlin/ ), 
  let 's look at this particular case :  120 policemen have been working full-time for 4 months to prepare the arrests let 's see . 
  that 's about 120 * 1/3 * 50 000 = $ 2 000 000 , excluding outsourcing costs and non-personnel costs  raids have been carried out by 1100 police men . 
  rough estimate including material costs and deployment of equipment : another $ 2 000 000 conservative estimate of the arrest of only ** one suspect ** : $ 4 mln . 
  that 's an expensive suspect . 
  i bet another team of 120 policemen is currently already preparing the next raid . 
  cost if one slips through the security : a disruptured society . 
  lol same here , second highest registration fee in the eu , right after denmark . 
   with english-speakers being an exception . 
  lol , english speakers are always the exception . 
  because non-greeks usually learn classic or koine greek . 
  a lot of languages associate the * u * with an ** / u / ** , as in the english word * ` who ' * . 
  in dutch , the * u * can have an ** / \u028f / ** or an ** / y\u02d0 / ** sound . 
  when we refer to the greek letter ` mu ' , we use the latter pronunciation , internationally more widely known by the german letter * \u00fc * . 
  but of course , absolutely not what a cow sounds like . 
  that 's why i used the umlaut . 
  for clarity , since our * u * is a bit different .

  let 's await how big it eventually will be . 
  have you walked through it ? 
  it could look like any building in a city centre . 
  furthermore , this is taken from the nice-ish side . 
  the other side is a cramped shopping street . 
  central administrative building in neighbouring countries are from a different league : impressive , big and have a significant prominence . 
  now , i do n't say it is a bad thing , since it actually fits our culture of * just act normal * , but it does not really fit the title of the ` prominent central government building ' if you compare it to others . 
  it 's a terrible map , the flags actually belong to the location where their poles are . 
  it 's the po valley in italy . 
  quite industrialised and enclosed by the alps in the north and west and the apennine mountains in the south , which makes it hard for winds to reach that area . 
  i do n't want to break expectations , but in reality it looks nowhere as cool as on this picture ... 
  i would rather say we have the most * ordinary * seat of government of many european countries . 
  especially if you consider it has a shopping street built right next to it on the other side , and there 's a market in front of it . 
  you can walk through it , you will only occasionally see some extra policemen , but apart from that : it would n't surprise me if some tourists have mistakenly walked through it without even realising it 's something special . 
  it 's going to be renovated , by the way . 
  a large part wo n't be accessible anymore in the coming years .

   as i understand it , pvv is essentially a party with geert wilders as the sole member it seems so , yes . 
  geert wilder was a member of the vvd before . 
  he has been mp in the lower house , part of the vvd fraction , but left the party in 2004 and started his own fraction . 
  you could say , that the pvv is an odd party , as indeed it seems to be solely ruled by geert wilders . 
  the party does not have party conferences , like the afd has seen for example . 
  although it 's technically a party , we often only refer to geert wilders , as the other members are not that well-known and most probably not that influential either . 
  the other party 's members i can name from memory are : machiel de graaf , fleur agema and dion graus . 
  and that 's about it . 
  i feel the others are more or less there to vote the way wilders votes in the parliament . 
  we do n't know much about the party financing either . 
  most parties receive funding from the government or from membership contributions , yet the pvv has refused government funds ...  i do n't really know enough about the elective system of the netherlands to understand it . 
  the differences with the german elective system are : * we do n't have a 5 % minimum . 
  so , if you get 1/150th of the votes , you have got yourself a seat . 
  ( [ okay , it 's slightly more complicated , due to correction and the calculation of remainders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d'hondt_method ) ) * technically , you do n't vote for a party , but for a person . 
  we do n't have two votes , but just one . 
  though most people vote for the top candidate ( spitzenkandidat ) , you can vote for the 2nd , 3rd , and so on . . person on the list of that party . 
  if the 7th person on the party list gets a lot of so-called * preference votes * , yet the party only gets 5 seats in total , that 7th person might still get into the parliament ( at the cost of the 5th person on the list or another less favoured person ) .
