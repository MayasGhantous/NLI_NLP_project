  they finally formally removed capital punishment from their electoral platform a few weeks ago . 
  however , on [ their website they state ] ( https://www.sgp.nl/standpunten/d/doodstraf ) they still consider the death penalty to be a reasonable way of punishment . 
  it was part of their party platform in the previous elections . 
  somehow i assumed you were talking about the christian stances of the cda , as a reaction on u/andrew2209 -- cda are moderate christians though . 
  not that pro-life like our reformist parties like * sgp * . 
  so , from what i can see from their party website : * they do accept aborts up to 24 weeks , though prefer prevention . 
  * the refuse legalisation of any kind of drugs ( including soft drugs ) * want to close more coffee shops , reduce use of weed and marihuana . 
  * hard crack down on hard drugs . 
  * lot of the pages on their website focus on ` family ' , ` traditional values ' and ` family values ' , in contrast to the other side of the spectrum ( greenleft ) , who focus on individual development . 
  * i could n't find a page on gay rights , but they say to be anti-discrimination . 
  their slogan for these elections is : * if we ca n't explain certain things to our children anymore , it 's time for change . 
  * [ ** cda website ** ] ( https://www.cda.nl/ ), 
  they are centrist , but are also ` flexible ' centrist . 
  they can go a bit to the left or a bit to the right , depending on the coalition they are in . 
  tough , socially , they tend to be on the more conservative side . 
  the current election campaign seems to primarily focus on the social aspects of the parties rather than the economical stances . 
  that 's why i put them in the same list . 
  the three most prominent and loudest parties in the election campaign over the past month were all socially conservative parties : pvv , vvd and cda . 
  and they all seem to focus on * mentality , values * and * morality * . 
  especially the pvv and vvd are trying to steal each others voters at this moment and they have ruled out any possible cooperation . 
  -- * ** pvv ** : socially conservative , anti-immigration , populist -- 1st in polls * ** vvd ** : socially conservative , economic liberalism -- 2nd in polls * ** cda ** : socially conservative , christian democrats -- 3rd or 4th in polls [ ** poll source ** , updated 18.01 ] ( http://peilingwijzer.tomlouwerse.nl/p/laatste-cijfers.html ), 
   note for those who are dutch : no , this is not similar to de hond 's proposal . 
  that one was exactly the other way around , ( replace ei by ij ) and also for the wrong reasons . 
  his proposal was not logical and solely because his daughter had troubles at school , whereas he should blame the stupid `` steve jobs '' ipad school , where he had sent his daughter to , instead . 
  i do n't know ... 
  most probably because it 's hard to change some spelling elements which remain from past developments . 
  though recently i 've been thinking about why it would be better to abolish the * ij * dipthong as well . 
  first , it 's a rare dipthong which contains a consonant . 
  that 's not logical for a dipthong , which is made out of vowel sounds . 
  secondly , we 've got another dipthong , which sounds exactly similar , but is written like * ei * . 
  solely composed of vowels . 
  thirdly , when the * ij * is in a syllable , that is not stressed , it 's more or less pronounced as an ** / \u0259 / ** or as an ** / \u026a / ** . 
  ( depending on dialect ) so it 's not a dipthong anymore . 
  though our * i * has exactly the same sound in an unstressed syllable . 
  so , since we 've already another more logical dipthong ( also more understandable for those who learned german , danish , norwegian , hell every germanic language except english ) , and since this * ij * switches pronunciation sometimes , i think it would make sense to replace it with * ei * and * i * . 
  the * ij * is actually redundant . 
  so , new words would become * ** gevaarlik ** * instead of * gevaarlijk * ** eigenlik ** * instead of * eigenlijk * ** eis ** * instead of * ijs * ** schreifweize ** * instead of * schrijfwijze compare * gef\u00e4hrlich , eigentlich , eis , schreibweise * -- * note for those who are dutch : no , this is not similar to de hond 's proposal . 
  that one was exactly the other way around , ( replace ei by ij ) and also for the wrong reasons . 
  nope . 
  at least not here . 
  although night temperatures go down to -2 , it goes up to +4 during the day for the rest of the coming week . 
  * - en * was only used in dative and male accusative declensions of adjectives , so it 's just * oude * without * n * and * gheenen * is complete nonsense . 
  haha , and do n't even dare to write * ij * . 
  that mistake can trigger some people 's ocd . 
  :p but it 's because it used to be one letter in the past : * y * . 
  some still consider it to be one letter and even treat it as such in the alphabet . 
  i remember it being listed under a different letter in the phone books . 
  so finally , some lakes are freezing over . 
  since the temperatures only drop below zero during the night , most lakes should not be skated on however ... our ice skating fever in a nutshell . 
  their offspring will surely integrate even better ... 
  what ? 
  i 've been told sweden is the rape capital in the world !, 
  why is n't sweden dark green to pitch black on this map ?? 
  must be a map made by the l\u00dcgenpresse !!, 
  this is a fake map to spread fake news !, 
  yes , there 's an alternative , but there 's still a huge amount of mps using the first oath . 
   i am glad i live here in the netherlands where this is not common practice [ ** are you very sure ? 
  ** ] ( https://youtu.be/jkic0rnppew ) it even takes longer in the netherlands than in the usa . 
  ehm no , from what i know , the northern states of west germany ( ns , sh ) are sometimes considered to be the * ` east of the west ' * . 
  living standards are considered to be a little bit higher in the southern west-german states than in the northern west-german states . 
  i would rather look for these differences than for the difference in day time , which is insignificant over this distance . 
  it might be more rainier near the coast , though apparently we and the uk seem to cope better with that . 
  there can also be a difference in diet . 
  [ and suicide ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/suicide-rates-by-country-in-europe/ ), 
  damn , some wisdom bombs are being dropped here ... 
  in that case , can you predict our results on march the 15th ? 
  you could make 4 out of 4 predictions right . 
  ** takes notes * so , do you have any recommendations for a certain wine ? 
   secondly : were n't the nordic countries supposed to have a much larger life expectancy since life is so much better over there and there is less inequality between the richest and the poorest ? 
  the darkness takes its toll . 
   czechistan lol, 
  so , drink more wine ? 
  can someone explain me why they demanded a change ? 
  btw , as far as i can remember , it has been * tsjechi\u00eb * in dutch forever . 
  ( well , since the break up of czechoslovakia of course ) i 've never seen the name * tsjechische republiek * in an atlas . 
  it 's mostly an ugly coast though . 
  a part of it has a boring boulevard with grey apartments such as in oostende , or apartments for rich people , such as knokke-heist . 
  without citystates or small states like macau , singapore or malta we 're the second most densily populated country in the world , after bangladesh . 
  ** cough * not before new york is renamed to * new amsterdam * again ... 
   transatmosph\u00e4rien hands down for this beautiful name . 
  germany should have * deutschluss * or * ende * . 
  allright , you take the moon , we take a mars village and call it * suffocationland * , so everyone stays away from mars . 
  i miss ** \u00d6xit ** !, 
  it has even been mentioned by [ ** die zeit ** ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2016-07/oexit-oesterreich-austritt-europa-norbert-hofer-fpoe ) and those dots above the o are just cool . 
  do n't they look cute ? 
  three ways to get a new car in the netherlands : * get one from your employer * be fucking rich * buy during one of those periods the government introduces temporary tax exemptions on electric/hybrid cars otherwise sneaky import , second-hand or inheritance it is ... well , one of those temporary tax discount period just ended . 
  one is allowed to explain the orange colour ... , 
  ah , i meant * bretons * , as in independent . 
  elsass-lothringen to germany ? 
  duinkerke , rijsel and kales to the netherlands ? 
  bretagne to the bretons ? 
  be aware when a belgian starts talking about colonies ... 
   the text on it is german though . 
  are you sure ? 
  in the netherlands the volkswagen golf is considered to be the * ` cunts ' car ' * ... 
  which is not that surprising , considering indonesia has been a colony of the netherlands until 1949 . 
  we have a significant amount of people from former colonies living in the netherlands or families who already got ` mixed ' in those colonies . 
  so , if i understand the other comments in this thread correctly , this article should be banned on the german facebook as this is * fake news * , right ? 
   the remaining , highly developed , supplies will come from somewhere else - simply because they likely are n't being produced in that region . 
  * steel : ijmuiden * research in autonomous driving : twente / delft * automotive parts : just across the border in germany,
