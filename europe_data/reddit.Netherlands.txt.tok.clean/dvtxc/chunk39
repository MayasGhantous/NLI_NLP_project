  huh , that was all just a big drama play-act by commie farmers in the north who wanted free money , was n't it ? 
  / s ** hides and ducks , while turning up the heater a bit * :p, 
  instructions of the website are unclear . 
  should i fap while scrolling through this and praising the glory of the netherlands ? 
   considering the area of the nuts2 regions in km ^ 2 wait what ?!, 
  this is a terrible choropleth map . 
  [ ** explanation ** ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:choropleth-density.png ), 
  it always ` feels ' more though ... 
   it does say though that $ 3,500 billion goes through the netherlands via conduit companies per year . 
  obviously that 's an insane amount for a country with a gdp of $ 850 billion , holy shit . 
  imagine if we demanded to pay back missed taxes with retrospective effect for just one year . 
  4 times our gdp for free . 
  yes you might be right on that . 
  sshhht , how else are we supposed to win the tesla gigafactory bid ? 
  nah , election time ... 
  they governed with our economic liberal party ( vvd ) that silently accepted most of the tax avoidances and labour ( pvda ) has lost a lot of seats over the last 4 years in the polls . 
  some suggest mainly due to this cooperation . 
   on sunday , theresa may suggested the uk would leave the single market when it leaves the eu in ** 2019 ** have i missed something ? 
  omg ... you really do n't see the sarcasm ... 
  the source is a major dutch newspaper ( trouw ) . 
  i have put the text through google translate and included below even though the numbers are only limited to the netherlands , i have decided to post this news article here on r/europe , since eventually the official crime numbers are included in international comparisons , and often referred to as a source in discussions here . 
  [ ** primary source by trouw ** ] ( http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/39681/nbsp/article/detail/4447567/2017/01/13/nederlandse-politie-ziet-de-meeste-misdaad-niet.dhtml ) - they got the reports first . 
  --  the crime rate in the netherlands is higher than indicated by official figures , concluded by the police and public prosecution in a confidential report . 
  criminals threaten thereby putting both public authorities ' unbridgeable disadvantage . 
   due to lack of capacity in the investigative services and decrease in the willingness to report to citizens and businesses , the figures do not convey the true extent of the crime . 
  the capacity to police and has since been at such a low level that the public is likely to lose confidence in law enforcement and criminals act like they can not be caught . 
   these are the main conclusions contained in a confidential note from the top of the police and the public prosecution service . 
  the report , in the possession of * trouw * , have been published right before the upcoming parliamentary elections of march 15th . 
  the note mounts of a looming `` unbridgeable disadvantage '' of the police and on perpetrators of crime . 
   ** signals **  ** according to the note , police and justice and mayors receive an increasing number of signs that `` the development of crime is actually less positive than indicated by the figures '' . 
  however , in reports to the lower house minister ard van der steur ( vvd ) , like his predecessor ivo opstelten ( vvd ) , have continuously stressed that crime rates are decreasing . 
  **  but the police do not see a lot of crime , says the note , and she has insufficient capacity to detect crime itself is not reported by victims . 
  especially in times of international turmoil and rising tension , according to police and of great importance to keep the gap between crime and capacity to detect as small as possible . 
   ** social phenomenon **  ** the gap between the reported crime and the perceived crime experienced by citizens is no less than 3.5 million crimes large quantify the authors , in order to show how acute the shortage in detection is . 
  the police registered only 960.000 crimes in 2015 , the bulk of them on the basis of a declaration . 
  **  however , in the annual victim survey of 65,000 people aged over 15 years , reported in 2015 , 18 percent of respondents to have been the victim , often more than once . 
  in total there are 34 crimes per 100 inhabitants . 
  by bill that number to the total population aged over 15 years produces about 4.5 million crimes ranging from bicycle theft to threat . 
   the authors of the memorandum explaining the gap partly because people eg fallow and theft accept a social phenomenon and not go to the police . 
  over the past decade increased willingness to report on such offenses by 23 percent . 
   ** diminishing declarations **  that happens often enough with the declarations will affect readiness . 
  of declarations and notifications police shifts more than half ( 57 percent ) to one side , mostly because of the lack of sufficient guidance . 
  in particular , the declarations do citizens via the internet ( 70 percent ) killed . 
  having in most cases no indications of a possible perpetrator or other evidence that could lead to a suspect . 
   of the final 412,000 records who shall process the police , she closed it without suspect 177,000 . 
  the prosecution had forwarded 225,000 records , 37,000 of them ended with a dismissal , which means it does not come to court any suspects . 
  eventually went about 170,000 cases in the prosecution process . 
  that 's 18 percent of recorded crime . 
   how much capacity the police lacks is not mentioned in the note . 
  compared to other countries , the netherlands has 3.17 ftes cops per 1,000 residents less than england and wales ( 3.51 ) and belgium ( 4.40 ) . 
  you learned very well at school . 
  you already lost schlesien , preusen , elzas-lotharingen , hinterpommern , neumark and northern schleswig . 
  you know that the next time we will get rhein-ruhr and ost-friesland ? 
  add to that pim fortuyn , who was openly gay . 
  at his time the most popular anti-immigration politician and furthermore a ton better than the pvv , which we currently have , imho ... oh those debates with marcel van dam . 
  debates one could truly enjoy watching . 
  one of the most popular anti-immigration politicians we have had in the netherlands was openly gay himself . 
  tell me something , at this very moment i am stuck since there are ** no ** trains driving at one of the busiest central stations of the country . 
  there is plenty of wind though , as they 're inspecting the dikes for tonight 's storm . 
  though travelling around the world in 80 days was still a challenge . 
  we will still complain about the trains . 
  i clicked the link , forgot i had my speakers very loud and suddenly my room filled with deafening #immersive 360 \u00b0 2160p 4k intense g\u00d6tterfunken, 
  the west of the netherlands has only seen some snow flakes that had disappeared already within a few hours . 
  especially the coastal regions had almost not seen anything . 
  it has been around +7 the whole week . 
  11th of january : still no snow in holland . 
  winter is slowly becoming a strange concept to dutch citizens . 
  it is n't as if they would n't have tried it otherwise , as was said in their plans in december : http://www.dw.com/en/berlins-new-left-wing-government-set-to-change-city/a-36296560  `` we will exhaust all the state political possibilities to make a policy that is humanitarian and brings opportunities to stay , '' bettina jarasch of the green party told the `` berliner morgenpost '' newspaper . 
  let 's say that berlin is quite an exception to how people in east germany vote . 
  furthermore , the actually gained quite something in berlin nevertheless . 
  and the gulfstream has been blocked . 
  the north sea now turns as cold as the baltic sea . 
  just a question , is * waz.de * something similar to * taz.de * ? 
   non important leftist stuff since they actually put quite some resources on these topics . 
  furthermore , it 's not even non-important , it 's a political push of an irrational ideology . 
  all i can say , we usually do not prescribe anything against flu in the netherlands . 
  gps will usually instead advice people to heal naturally even if it takes two weeks , unless you belong to risk group ( elderly , very young , etc ) oseltamivir phosphate is ** not ** covered either in the netherlands , since we do not prove it to be effective [ ** source ** ( dutch ) ] ( https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ecli:nl:rbams:2008:bc5569&amp;keyword=tamiflu ) , so you would have to pay for it yourself . 
  even higher insurance plans would not cover it here , i think ... 
  furthermore , you 'd have been sent home anyway here if you came to the hospital for a flu , since those cases are handled by general practitioner , and definitely not hospitals . 
  hospitals are reserved for more intensive / expensive health care only . 
   i go to a hospital with my insurance card , and my antiviral flu meds are still not even covered ... and no one will explain to me why . 
  why would one go to a hospital for antiviral flu meds though ? 
  of which i can furthermore say that viroids , such as the flu , are usually not countered by medication . 
   had n't those hipsters from prague invent a new language to impress ladies wut ? 
  [ * somewhat relevant * ] ( http://hck.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/zwitserleven-659x371.jpg ), 
  if it did , we would not be on this map , as we only have private short-term health insurance and hospitals are technically companies as well . 
  two hospitals recently went bankrupt in the netherlands . 
  be careful , the last time inhabitants in czechia were said to be germans , sudetenland was suddenly anschlussed ... 
  ** looks for the netherlands * ** looks for finland * upvoted !, 
  that 's data from 2000 . 
  almost 17 years old . 
  we have had a major overhaul of our entire healthcare system in the meantime . 
  i am still waiting for the first person from switzerland , posting a photo of his local clinic . 
  the unemployment differences in 2004 almost precisely followed the old borders of the weimarrepubliek . 
  how does that come ? 
  that escalated quickly . 
  we always complain about everything . 
   netherlands ( almost ) always loses to finland ** cough *, 
  i took the scores from the bar graph ( blue/yellow overall ranking ) and made the map myself , because the layout of some of the graphs is terrible ...
