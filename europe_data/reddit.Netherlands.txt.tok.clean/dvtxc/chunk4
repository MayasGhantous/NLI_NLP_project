  not only has all the money that was intended for greece indirectly flown back to german banks , germany now wants to spend eu money on africa . 
  it really shows how little germany/eu actually gives about southern europe .

  i would describe the current geopolitical situation in many african countries at this moment [ ** anything but peaceful ** ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/ongoing_conflicts_around_the_world.svg/1000px-ongoing_conflicts_around_the_world.svg.png ) . 
  how in earth are we going to control this money flow ? 
  the western european countries had already seen a democratic and transparent legislative framework for decades , if not longer , which made this enormous marshall plan possible . 
  secondly , there was actually also a big red scare that made the usa decide to provide financial aid for the european countries . 
  the important logic behind a major argument for the financial aid was : broken countries tend to be susceptible to communist revolts .

  those pesky belgian revolutionists . 
  should become south netherlands again . 
   there 's very little willingness to rely on allies militarily since . 
  cabinets balkenende i , ii , iii and iv proved otherwise . 
  it even led to the fall of the fourth one in 2010 , since the _ cda _ and _ cu _ wanted to prolong the involvement in uruzgan at any cost , afraid to be seen as unwilling to contribute by other countries .

  unless someone writes an astounding and overwhelming essay that will convince me , i do not support an eu army either . . we have been involved in many far conflicts over the past years , usually to appease the us in their middle eastern interventions or to prove that our military ` still matters ' . 
  if we accept an eu wide military cooperation , we once again will not be able to withstand the centralised policy regarding military involvement . 
  current cooperation with the german and british army comes from an economical urge to make the army economically more efficient ( we have had enormous austerity measures on military expenses over the past two decades ) , yet we do at least still have the last say on where we deploy or send our troops to . 
  also , since we do not particularly have a positive view of the eu at this moment , i do not think people would like to see the eu outlining policies in yet another field , namely military strategies . 
  if the view on the eu changed , our stance towards an unified eu army perhaps could change . 
  so i would not devote our current rejection purely to the _ autonomy _ argument . 
  so , it would be safe to call estonia just * tallinnland * or * tallinnmaa * ? 
  you probably mean _ leningrad _ , comrade . 
  how on earth is international peace & security ranked and weighted in the overall grading ? 
  misunderstood serbian town . 
  they are full of love . 
   benelux that 's just the politically correct term for * greater netherlands * . 
  netherlands can not into oecd . 
  luxemburg and belgium are included though . 
  what 's this ? 
  calm down , we have some of those idiots in our municipalities run by reformed parties as well . 
  note should be added to the netherlands : it depends on municipal level . 
  some municipalities strongly oppose the possibility for shops to open on sundays and these municipalities happen to be mostly located in the so-called * bible belt * of our country . 
  municipal councils have the possibility to override these regulations if i 'm not mistaken . 
  wait . . 
  some supermarkets like bunnpris and kiwi are open on sunday in norway , although they are only allowed to do so on sunday if the total area of the selling floor is < 100-150 m ^ ^ 2 or somewhere in that range . 
  that 's why these supermarkets open a small part of the total supermarket floor on sundays , limiting the assortment to the more basic products . 
  furthermore , if i am not mistaken , exceptions to these regulations exist during christmas holidays , since i 've seen supermarkets opening their entire supermarket on sundays in december .

  it 's the other way around here .

  lol , the ex-main editor of the dutch news broadcaster explicitly stated multiple times ( vk 25 may 2002 , dtg 1 nov 2003 ) in interviews that the news is biased as most of their broadcasting organisation just tend to vote more left-wing parties and some content is disregarded or changed . 
  just as has been pointed out by multiple critics ( [ mar 2004 ] ( https://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.henrysturman.com%2fdutch%2fartikelen%2fnos.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) , [ apr 2004 ] ( https://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.henrysturman.com%2fdutch%2fartikelen%2fnos2.html&amp;edit-text= ) ) . 
  nothing has ever changed since then . 
  it has even shifted further to the left . 
   i do n't care about what religion people have nor their ethnicity but when you ca n't associate with the people you live around , it causes divides . 
  when it is more common to hear some african language or arabic than swedish i do n't feel at home anymore . 
  i try to say hello to some of these neighbours but half of them does n't even reply but instead look at me suspiciously and angrily . 
  this is pretty sad . 
  ** even if ** statistically speaking the hard numbers on theft , arson , harassment would n't sky rocket , so politicians can say that anti-immigration sentiments are just something between our ears ... the deterioration of these neighbourhoods is nevertheless worrisome . 
  this change can not be expressed in numbers , can not be described in simple sensational headlines , but it angers the native citizens who have been living for a long time , as their home gradually alienates . 
  the same applies to the major cities in the netherlands in certain neighbourhoods . 
  take a look at the average visitor of the market . 
  mostly you 'll see veiled women walking behind a man , ordering their goods in poorly intelligible dutch , and by chance the fruit seller is moroccan or turkish himself , so they do n't even have to switch languages . 
  if you look at their children , it 's an easy guess of what culture they will clamp on to . 
  yes , i do feel safe at the market . 
  so do most people who 'd vote for example on anti-immigration parties ( usually they 've been the regular visitors of these markets in the city as the working class of a city ) . 
  these people did n't suddenly become xenofobic . 
  but do they feel at home ? 
  lol . 
  brilliant solution !, 
  what 's up with the line spacing of this article ? 
  nope . 
  we will use that space for expanding our country further into the sea .

  * the eu should be prepared to give generous financial support to countries like tunisia to accommodate the refugees . 
  * but i think it will just fail completely , if i read this :  allerdings gibt es in tunesien zurzeit kein asylsystem , es fehlt ein rechtsrahmen , der die fl\u00fcchtlinge sch\u00fctzt . 
  ** * however , in tunisia there 's no working legislative asylum system that guarantees the protection of the refugees at this moment . 
  tunisia furthermore even prohibits their citizens to offer help to those without a residence permit . 
  it is even punishable by law to give them to eat or provide medical help . 
  the coalition has had a fairly open-border policy up to now . 
  at least a policy that accepted the full asylum process of boat refugees . 
  thomas de maiziere suddenly turned to an australia-like border policy , but is part of the same government which favoured the former policy . 
  this is a serious turn . 
  and the coalition is still led by merkel . 
  either the rest of the cdu actually agrees with the new proposal of maiziere and merkel will just have a hard time to explain the new direction the coalition is heading , or cdu will stay loyal to merkel 's approach and you will get a split coalition . 
  this is my understanding of how a coalition works . 
  usually , all parties which are part of coalition should be able to agree on the government policies . 
  de maiziere suddenly made a u-turn with this proposal . 
  does n't this imply a possible coalition collapse of the spd and cdu ? 
  i mean , you ca n't just sling this 180 degree turn into the media without expecting this to turn against you , when you are part of the coalition that has been responsible for merkel 's refugee policy . 
  furthermore , it looks like the spd has been trying to overtake merkel 's cdu on the right-hand side lately ... or just preparing for elections a year in advance . 
  6 years here . 
  forgot most of it again . 
  despite cooperation , poland can not into space . 
  so far , i 've only found this news in german news sources . 
  if someone can put this through google translator that would be great . 
  copy pasting is usually a bit harder and tedious on mobile ... tl : dr ; german minister thomas de maziere ( spd ) wants that boat refugees are sent back while they 're at sea . 
  the greens and left have already responded on this proposal , pointing out that this violates the rights of the refugees .
