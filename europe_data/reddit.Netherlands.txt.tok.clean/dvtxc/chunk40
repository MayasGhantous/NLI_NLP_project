  i know i could improve on some points ( colour-blind friendliness ) , but at least , it looks more appealing now . 
  #gesetzliche krankenversicherung though , the dutch name is n't a translation of the german term , rather how the system was called in the netherlands . 
  so a true translation would be : ** wettelijke ziektekostenverzekering ** , which can look quite intimidating to foreigners as well . 
  we have trumped finland . 
  that 's what counts . 
  we had a very similar healthcare system to yours before 2006 . 
  a national health insurance ( ** de ** : gesetzliche krankenversicherung / ** nl ** : ziekenfonds ) beside private insurances for those who have an higher income . 
  but we abandoned this system to a state regulated private competitive insurance healthcare system . 
  for short-term care , there 's no national system anymore , everyone is obliged to take a private health insurance . 
  though the competition is state regulated .

  haha , but i mean , this design is clearly influenced by the ar-15 and there exist so many modifications on it . 
  just like there exist at least hundred local variants on the ak-47 . 
  besides that i would be able to tell apart the more `` deviating '' designs , such as famas , aug , p90 , scar . . 
  lol , to me it 's just * ar-15-like *, 
  i know it 's quite an american thing to say * muh . . second amendment * , but to me this actually shows that it 's the country 's overall mentality and perhaps checks at distribution that make the difference in gun violence rather than gun laws themselves . 
  * frisian , technically, 
  all that remains is a glorious military abbreviation to refer to this apparatus : schgbrbrt iv , which obviously refers to : #schlagbohrmaschinearmbrust iv, 
  if almost every vowel has turned into the same sound as that of the * iota * ... 
   i think i will vote for merkel . 
  she is a woman . 
  seems logical to vote for her in this scenario . 
  you know that you can apply the same logic to another woman , right ? 
  * gender identity : * to be really honest , when was the last time a job interviewer asked you what your gender identity is , assuming you have n't expressed this yet by fashion or by surgery ? 
  well , with all respect to the danes , despite that most foreigners say our languages are quite comparable , danish is among the weirdest sounding languages of all i have heard . 
  it 's even weirder when you consider that norwegian , although written almost identically , however manages to sound normal . 
  a hot potato stuck in the throat . 
   that 's before we consider how much of a disaster the mixed schools in berlin/hamburg have been tell me more please !, 
  for me , it 's hard to comprehend how mixed schools work , but apparently a lot of foreigners find our school system ( in which pupils are categorised at an age of 12 ) quite discriminating . 
  netherlands \u2764 poland . 
  we have never invaded each other !, 
  only in luxemburg ? 
  ^ ^ keeps ^ ^ quiet ^ ^ about ^ ^ the ^ ^ possibility ^ ^ we ^ ^ have ^ ^ to ^ ^ freely ^ ^ travel ^ ^ in ^ ^ the ^ ^ entire ^ ^ netherlands . 
  but congratz . 
  too bad though that interesting places just across the border ca n't be visited , e.g. 
  trier , dinant ... 
  has anyone ever compared these results to whether a country has a level-divided education system ? 
  so , it 's just a reallocation of resources ? 
  tl ; dr : bridges in west germany are actually worse than in east germany . 
  most bridges in east germany are quite new due to the great infrastructure renewal in the 90 's , called the * verkehrsprojekte deutsche einheit * , whereas the bridges in the west are a lot older . 
  [ relevant : ** law of the handicap of a head start ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_the_handicap_of_a_head_start ), 
  and we have got aldi nord in the entire country ... : /, 
  i would n't trust all their autobahns either at this moment . 
  [ ** their bridges seem to be in a bad condition . 
  mountains , beer , dirndls , great food , fast cars and good economy , oh and did i mention * mountains * ? 
  how do i become bavarian ? 
  :p / s, 
  belgium , take notice . 
  the point is , i am surprised he actually managed to walk through so many forms and filling them out . 
  even the simplest actions in germany , require you to read through terribly long documents , given you can find the right \u00a7 in the document , after which they want hard copies threefold , even after submitting the documents digitally . 
  making an error somewhere , requires you to walk through all the steps again . 
  this is all done by post or in person . 
  or at least , those are my experiences ... 
  * deutsche p\u00fcnktlichkeit * is only reserved for germans themselves when they have to go through their country 's bureaucracy , it seems ... ... now try to incorrectly fill out ** one ** field on a form as a citizen when renewing your passport , or registering residency in a new municipality . 
  lol , in all the episodes great landscapes are traversed , whilst in this episode he just takes one of the busiest forensic lines of the country . 
  all i can say that a similar referendum currently has equal , if not less chance to succeed than in 2005 in the netherlands . 
  [ ** because the last dutch european constitution referendum ( 2005 ) worked out so well ... ** ] ( https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/61.6%25_of_the_dutch_people_say_%27no%27_to_eu_constitution ) ... oh and [ ** france ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_european_constitution_referendum,_2005 ) did not like it either . 
  fastest rising search term in belgium : ** dutch ** fastest rising search term in the netherlands : ** arab ** lol . 
  hold on , it gets more ridiculous : morocco is one of the few countries that does not let you lose moroccan citizenship and this is why we can not abandon dual citizenship . 
  this makes it hard for me to understand , how they can ** refuse ** these people . 
  they are their citizens ... 
  wait ... how do the shadows work here ? 
  it seems that i have missed another public shitstorm in the news , even though i usually watch that programme . 
  but at least the journalist wierd duk is involved again . 
   except when they are negative about muslims , then they will be up in arms and harass the journalist who wrote the piece . 
  for some context : i assume he refers to [ ** machteld zee ** ] ( http://www.ad.nl/nieuws/achter-islamisering-zit-een-plan~a88e1806/ ) who has been harassed online after writing her academic dissertation and a book on islamisation at leiden university which went against the main stream narrative in contemporary academic sociology . 
  the journalist who interviewed her , wierd duk , has received quite some comments as well . 
  differences in purchasing power and the parties people are voting for are still huge though . 
  even 26 years after reunification . 
  same question , just leaving a reply here . 
  recently an interview with some arab liberal sociologists and philosophers aired on dutch television . 
  they seem to understand the bitter reality of lots of immigrants a lot better than most of our proclaimed * sociologists * , whose ideas are rather based on naivety . 
  patriarchism and intolerance towards women , non-believers and gays is tolerated inside refugee centres , as the staff can not fight these beliefs . 
  instead people , who might need protection inside these centres , are advised to be better off by disguising themselves . 
  it 's pretty sad that official measures in principle come back to just * keeping an arm length away * from those who might hurt you . 
  i think it is difficult to post the link here , as the dutch broadcaster blocks off online viewers from abroad . 
   it is not possible to directly deport them to morocco or algeria as these countries ** refuse to accept them . 
  ** now listen , pesky sand governments , what if we refused to give ye financial support any longer ? 
  the netherlands are not some one-way dumping ground for people ye do n't want . 
  albania , at least , has accepted their economic migrants back . 
  every misstep of russia is answered by economical sanctions , yet we genuflect at the altar of politeness when addressing morocco and algeria . 
  ** relevant : ** foreigners , who had been sent back , have received welfare and child support according to dutch standards in morocco for a long time . 
  ( imagine the purchasing power it gave them . ), 
  their government was furious when we tried to lower the welfare of people who 'd been living in morocco for years . 
  so , what exact address can we send them to ? 
  but does french water make their cows purple ? 
  until suddenly a russian submarine appears somewhere in the vicinity of stockholm ... 
  roller-coaster tycoon style picking up people ? 
  what u/prins _ pils means , they were n't in the past : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iotacism, 
  reminds me of the swiss air force , which only operates during office hours . 
  what , a country can have more than one ? 
  these are some great case-sensitive passwords i can use . 
  no , i did that on purpose . 
  ** slow clap *, 
  cameras are cheap nowadays so it 's an easy investment for police intelligence . 
  they are supposed to be used to tackle misuse of leased cars ( which get a lot of tax exemptions in the netherlands ) , though it is obvious that the possibilities stretch much further than that , and probably are , or undoubtedly will be used for much more . 
  worse . 
  every 100 m on the highways is being monitored by dozens of cameras . 
  b-roads are slowly getting cramped with cameras as well . 
  [ ** video : counting the number of cameras on the a12 ** ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2015/07/das_leben_der_autobahn.html ) ( including dutch lesson on how to count to 500 ) this guy counted the number of cameras on a stretch of about 50 ~ 60 km in this video .
