  there have been counted about 500 cameras on this stretch !, 
  and i have seen a lot of new camera 's being installed on roads i often drive since then . 
  wait until they will force car manufacturers to enable transmission of real-time gps location at any time . 
  dutch government is already opting for rfid-chips in all licence plates . 
  furthermore , all dutch highways are cramped with dozens of cameras literally every fucking 100 m. [ ** video : counting the number of cameras on the a12 ** ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2015/07/das_leben_der_autobahn.html ) ( including dutch lesson on how to count to 500 ) about 500 cameras on a stretch of about 50-60km . 
  a lot of camera 's are being installed now on b-roads as well . 
  these are not speed cameras , but camera 's for automated traffic information and police and intelligence services . 
  well , in principle you are supposed to be able to show an id at anytime when an officer asks you to do . 
  an id card issued within the eu / eea countries are accepted as a valid identification document in all eu and eea countries . 
  * vvd * and * cda * have been in a minority coalition from 2010 to 2012 . 
  they got support from the * pvv * , though this party withdrew their support after which the coalition fell in 2012 . 
  * d66 * has been in a coalition with * vvd * and * cda * from 1994 to 1998 and from 2003-2006 , and with * vvd * and * pvda * from 1998 to 2002 . 
  the combination * vvd+d 66 + pvv * never existed . 
  ironically they call themselves * think * , though it 's the least rational party in the lower house . 
  one member has even given a speech in arabic in the lower house . 
  the d66 and pvv are natural enemies . 
  d66 : economic liberalism , progressive , eu-federalism , alde , * ( pro-immigration ) * pvv : * ( economic left-wing ) * , conservative , eu-scepticism , anti-immigration * ( minor programme elements ) *, 
   groenlinks also does n't believe in pseudoscience , as far as i know . 
  [ ** their gender ideology is the very definition of pseudoscience . 
  they say geenstijl readers are crabby persons . 
  you prove this to be wrong . 
   pvda is centrist left . 
  not as left as the sp , but the pvda is just left . 
  pvda is a classic social democratic party . 
  like labour in the uk , spd in germany and ap in norway . 
  they 've been pulled right in the current coalition , but the party in itself is purely left . 
  furthermore , they have often been called * the party of the immigrants * , before denk split off from them , as the turkish guest workers have been a solid part of their voters base . 
  so , what are the most prominent `` open border '' fanatics on the left end of the gr\u00dcnen ? 
  i would actually favour something like a black/green if such combination existed in the netherlands . 
  * `` i respect every opinion , except the opinions that differ from my opinion . 
  you included artikel1 and geenpeil but not fvd ... 
  afd is better than the pvv though . 
  i 'm still waiting for some kind of party conference , or a constructive debate . 
  it 's not really a party , it 's wilders and seat filling . 
  petry is n't like wilders . 
  wilders is more like le pen . 
   green/fdp coalition the greens will be torn apart , if that happens . 
  it depends on the leader 's direction , which has changed sometimes . 
  it has a centre-right wing and a centre-left wing , though the centre-right is at this moment a bit more prominent . 
  it 's quite broad since it is a fusion of three parties . 
  centre-left example : ruud lubbers , dries van agt centre-right example : maxime verhagen , camiel eurlings, 
  * les extr\u00eames se touchent * the pvv and sp are actually fighting over a large common voter group . 
  centrist , christian ( mostly catholic ) , a bit on the conservative side , though not as much as u/krabbhd implies . 
  comparable to the german * cdu * . 
  can go left or right , depending on the coalition they 're in . 
   sp is a far left socialist party . 
  a long time ago it was the communist party . 
  there are some there , but most commies went to ** groenlinks ** . 
  now they 're basically green commies . 
  [ ** communistic party netherlands ** ] ( https://nl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/communistische_partij_van_nederland ), 
   very intelligent you misspelled naive wishful thinker . 
  socialist party . 
  a bit populistic left wing . 
  spear points for next election : reintroduction of collective health insurance . 
  ( currently we 've a state-regulated private health care system , rated number 1 in europe for the 6th time in a row ), 
  no , most ex-communists ended up in * groenlinks * . 
  look up the history of the [ ** cpn ** ] ( https://nl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/communistische_partij_van_nederland ), 
  i respectfully disagree ... ** edit : ** ... but i am afraid anti-federalism is n't a very popular opinion here on r/europe , considering how people express their opinion with downvotes . 
  yes . 
  berchtesgaden is surprisingly brown on this map . 
  this is actually pretty accurate . 
  it 's comparable to * fdp * in germany . 
  currently they 're in a coalition with the dutch variant of the * spd * , which after the forming the coalition , plummeted to a historic low in the polls . 
  tl ; dr : money flows through a mix of for-profit and tax-exempt non-profit companies from ikea stores to the netherlands , to liechtenstein , to cura\u00e7ao ( kingdom of the netherlands ) , to luxemburg , back to the netherlands again and add some nepotism in all those companies .

  how does snow look like ?

  why would one go from paris to warsaw ** over budapest ** ? 
  paris - barcelona : 6:15 amsterdam - berlin : 6:20 one would think our eastbound train connections should have been improved at some point in history ... / s / s, 
   though that 's more of stereotype . 
  ** cough *, 
  better keep an eye to the east then , in case they suddenly start to renew the highways in belgium again . 
  thx, 
  that flair though in this thread . 
  ^ ^ no , ^ ^ not ^ ^ the ^ ^ other ^ ^ one, 
  trust me , you need that . 
  going faster on belgian highways is not part of regular car testing . 
  it wo n't stand the vibrations . 
  haha , i will try this for fun on this subreddit for a year . 
  i suggest you just return to * thou * and * ye * . 
  `` catholic '', 
  i get the point , but it bears a different connotation though : a lot more generalised . 
  most languages can even distinguish between those three . 
  english people keep asking why you 'd need a distinction between * you * ( singular ) and * you * ( plural ) in a language . 
  this is why . 
  the netherlands are wrong , it should read : [ * `` bedankt voor de bloemen !, 
  '' * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1kxl4kgva ) -- explanation : pope john paul ii and benedict xvi have always thanked the netherlands for the flowers during the urbi et orbi , as a dutch company provided the flower decorations at the square every year . 
  they always thanked in dutch . 
  o god ... what have we done . 
  the same people [ ** have made another movie ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfnzcffylic ) , though it contains way too many inside jokes to become popular abroad , i think . 
  it has a lot of references to recent dutch events ( sometimes tragic events including casualties ) , usually in the category * a bit too soon to make jokes about *, 
   new kids turbo and new kids nitro .
