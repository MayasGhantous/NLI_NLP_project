  o.o omg !, 
  i 've stored the dutch 1 and 2 eurocent coins in them as well as they have become already archaic . 
  it 's even more of a mindfuck . 
  not only do norwegians truly end their sentences as if they are pinched in the back , [ there are different tone switches ] ( https://youtu.be/5fkzwoktd_q?t=136 ) that change the meaning of the words . 
  i once met a danish girl whose accent was even way stronger than this one . 
  at some point , i though it would even be more practical if she spoke danish instead . 
  but yes , it is really recognisable . 
  by the way , i recently discovered that alicia vikander in the film * en kongelig aff\u00e6re * is actually swedish . 
  how did they make her speak danish ? 
  i have n't been able to spot some hidden potato in the film ... 
   strikes : every fucking day until the end of time . 
  is n't that how every day life is in france ? 
   * pvv wins dutch elections quite likely , vvd will be most likely a runner-up . 
  i also predict the longest cabinet formation ever in dutch history , which will even outlast the longest belgian one , so they can make jokes on us this time . 
   * # 1 = $ 1 after a50 invoked hehe , and brexiters wanted to move further from the eu . 
  it was all part of the master plan to accommodate the switch to the euro . 
   * marine le pen gets closer to presidency than predictions , but fillon still wins no , r/le _ pen releases nudes of marion just before the elections : le pen wins . 
   * merkel wins 4th term , afd wins significant number of seats you want drama ? 
  let 's see : csu breaks ties with cdu . 
  spd and cdu do n't get a majority . 
  spd swings back left . 
  rrg becomes the governing coalition . 
  max . 
  speed on all autobahns reduced to 80 km/h . 
  deportations are reversed . 
  anger in eastern afd strongholds intensifies . 
  wilders builds a wall and promises to make germany pay for it . 
   50 + please no . 
  i hope they get involved in a new scandal before march 2017 , so the party will be dissolved by then . 
   in previous elections wilders has been overrepresented in the polls [ he was not ] ( https://www.allepeilingen.com/index.php/peilingen-politieke-partijen-vanaf-2004-pvv.html ) * ** 2006 elections ** : predicted ~ 3 , result 9 * ** 2010 elections ** : predicted ~ 17 , result 24 * ** 2012 elections ** : predicted ~ 17 , result 15 when looking at the polls of around two months before elections . 
   the greens in itself is quite interesting becaause that party is quite torn internally between a far left and a more centrist wing of the party . 
  one part of the party that wants rrg and one that wants black green and we do n't know yet which part will dominate . 
  why do n't they split up ? 
  would they get themselves in trouble because of that 5 % barrier ? 
  i appreciate green technology ( though new developments in nuclear power is something i have been very impressed by and supportive of as well ) , but i just do not want to be associated with those ideological lunatics on the far end . 
  on a sidenote : the number of parties in the bundestag seems to be really boring compared to our lower house . 
  ( especially if you compare it to the pre-1990 setting , in which it was just spd vs. union + fdp ), 
   in finland we took got 30 000 ~ asylum seekers in 2015 , and only 877 of them were syrians . 
  when people got upset by the amount of people our politicians told us `` you got ta understand that there is war in syria , and we got ta help them '' ... got some sauce for that ? 
  my ability to navigate through finno-ugric sites is n't that great . 
   expansive tell me where i can get those expandable donuts !, 
   if it was the balkan route closing that caused it would n't we expect people to pile up in greece or bulgaria and not in turkey ? 
  they do in greece , at the macedonian border and only recently have forcefully been relocated to refugee centres elsewhere in the country . 
  and although turkey has a larger number of refugees in total , most of them actually live near the syrian border in massive camps . 
  they never had the intention to travel further . 
   also considering that gabriel , the spd chancellor candidate [ that has not officially been announced yet , has it ? 
  ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/gabriel-scholz-101.html ) furthermore , the grand coalition have lost seats in the polls and two more parties can enter the bundestag if they get over 5 % of the votes ( afd and fdp ) increasing the divisor . 
  now , i understand it 's 8 months till the elections , but for german standards the majority of the red-black is n't that big anymore . 
   one thing you also have to consider in german politics that the left ( the party ) is a lot stronger in the former east than in the west . 
  well , i would n't suspect a lot of those people in the west either . 
  the greens on the other hand are represented in almost every west-german state except saarland and bavaria . 
  though i have heard that in some states ( like in bw ) they are quite different from the * national * greens . 
  the airport in slovakia to visit vienna when flying with ryanair . 
  i know we 're small in comparison to germany , but we are not * that * small ... 
   we have seen the turkey deal correlation does not automatically imply a causal relation , as most balkan countries closed their borders simultaneously . 
   we have deported people to afghanistan . 
  which has been a difficult thing to get started . 
  a majority of them actually left the country voluntarily , most probably the honest ones . 
  meanwhile [ opposition parties call deportations of people who have been convicted of crime ` brutal ' ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-opposition-cant-stop-deportations-to-afghanistan/a-36804368 ) . 
  speaking of opposition parties : i have no idea how politics at the state level and national level interact in germany , but i hope the newly formed coalition in berlin is not going to be a blueprint for co-operation of those three parties in the bundestag ... ( which currently do virtually have a majority ) that would mean everything will most probably be reversed . 
  ai , can i join ? 
  we can exchange some cheese . 
  protecting potatoes is a serious business in eastern europe . 
  they hate card payments in germany . 
  ** cough * a lot of the mentioned things apply to amsterdam as well . 
  the city itself is nice , just its inhabitants on the other hand ... . allerdings sind wir laut dieser nachricht kein kleines land . 
  automatised system are nowhere as good as humans in object recognition , especially under bad conditions , and planning of complex tasks . 
  while automatised systems can work pretty well , a difficult thing to implement is a * take-over request * : a request from the machine for the human to take over in case it can not handle input data correctly . 
  when you let go too much for too long periods , humans will lose their driving skills , let alone their skill to respond to a complex situation within fractions of a second after long periods of boredom . 
  assumed the system is clever enough to detect the situations in which it can not handle the situation correctly at all , which can already by challenging to implement in itself ... 
  yes and no ... 
  i understand your intention , which is for a good cause , but fully automatic take-over systems which can not be overridden or switched off under certain conditions are nevertheless a little bit eerie . 
  i have seen plentiful examples in which these systems caused false alarms . 
  actually i am also a bit surprised this guy had n't turned off this system , as they can be overridden in trucks , if i am not mistaken . 
  ** looks for the netherlands * ** looks for finland * hehe , 
  screenshots from ( german ) social media posts and reactions with bizarre stories . 
  usually excerpts from people who post all kinds of conspiracy theories in the comments or just make plain stupid posts . 
  so , it 's a compilation of social media posts which make think out loud * `` dafuq , did i just read ? 
  '' * the name comes from some story in which someone said that he had received a fine of $ 600 . 
  this had become some kind of meme in r/de . 
  r/600euro is leaking ... 
  women who want to give birth to the child at home , and when something happens they still have to be transported to the hospital anyway . 
  the netherlands have had one of the highest child birth mortality of western european countries for a long time due to the shear amount of women who wanted to give birth at home at all costs . 
  this is the major contributor . 
  pure stubbornness . 
   and more career-before-baby moms jep . 
  * ** naivety ** thinking the whole words is just flowers and rainbows * ** hubris ** thinking you can solve a problem on your own , which has been attempted to solve by numerous world leaders including advisory staff i bet * anna alboth * has a combination of these two as well . 
  wait , we have n't turned all our gas reserves into profit yet . 
  that 's some next level newspeak . 
  considering the fact that a large part of tesla 's revenues come from norway and the netherlands , i think the netherlands have a decent chance to win this race . 
  it will also decrease the transportation cost to other countries . 
  ( to germany with 81 million inhabitants a very big potential market if they keep on track with their energiewende ) . 
  a lot of goods enter germany via rotterdam , so why not already place a production site as well near the german border ? 
  ow and taxes . 
   we ^ might ^ ^ be ^ ^ slightly ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ tax ^ ^ ^ heaven ... 
  if they took football players , our average skin tone would be a lot darker . 
  at least darker than caucasian average . 
  maybe i live in the wrong part of the country , but i find the true interpretation of * average * on this map hard to interpret for the netherlands . 
  0 . o oh , and prepare for emancipated women . 
  you are cooking .
