  that might be a difference compared to romania . 
  but well , they always say the grass is greener on the other side of the fence , is n't it ? 
  what if asia is a peninsula of eurasia ?

   intelligence is only a very small part of why birth rate is low in ** west . 
  ** unless you consider the netherlands not to be part of the western world . 
  access to birth control is mostly guaranteed by health insurances in the netherlands . 
  likewise , sexual education is part of all school curricula when pupils are 12 years old . 
   uk surveillance and nsa are far , very far away from totalitarian shit in 1984 . 
  no one has ever said it would come immediately . 
  you have to keep in mind that intelligence agencies possess tools that could n't be thought of in the time when 1984 was written . 
  real-time position of individuals , complete personal profiles describing interests or preferences , centralised health records storage ... internet has created plentiful of opportunities that reach out even further than george orwell could ever imagine .

  these dystopias have been written as fiction and as a warning . 
  not as a guide to follow . 
  just as i do n't see concepts from ** the time machine ** ( parallel societies ) unthinkable in the far future , either divided by intelligence like in ** gattaca ** , or divided by wealth like in ** elysium ** . 
  no , we just annexed switzerland for the mountains , so we are n't ridiculed by our neighbours anymore . 
  * `` despite being separated by belgium on the mainland of europe , the kingdom of the netherlands and france share a border on the other side of the atlantic on an island so nice , they named it thrice . 
  and the public broadcaster is pushing its leftist journalism agenda as well . 
  we have seen the same thing with * sinterklaas * . 
  a few years ago , it was only abolished or altered at some schools . 
  once the public broadcaster tried to push this agenda , we split the entire country and the depiction of the characters was soon changed in commercials and merchandise . 
  [ ** source ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5jmrsy/markets_open_again_in_berlin_whatever_terrorists/dbi4wh6/ ), 
  * christmas dinner * has been replaced with * winter dinner * or * mid-winter celebration * or * december celebration * . 
  even tv commericals sometimes avoid the name * christmas * . 
  google translate :  after the fierce debate about zwarte piet is again a public holiday under pressure : christmas . 
  a growing number of businesses , schools and institutions avoids convulsively the word christmas to ` other faiths ' not to hurt . 
  they wish each other therefore ` desire fine days '' , send greeting cards and organize winter celebrations . 
  or even delete the entire word . 
   at elementary schools , the `` christmas cramp ` good to see . 
  several schools now organize year-end meals instead of christmas meals such as elementary bows in harderwijk . 
  `` i do not know why we have chosen the word new year meal '' tries director erik fish yet . 
  but after some insistence he admits . 
  `` we believe in school much different , so we chose to not mention christmas , but we called the year-end meal out of respect for everyone . '', 
  he does not want to answer further questions . 
  `` i do not want here . 
  goodbye , `` and throws the phone down . 
   also deleted the word christmas 7th montessori school in amsterdam and children invited to a winter dinner . 
  the management will not answer any questions . 
  in a conversation with an angry parent gives the director or to `` we still would not speak about christmas in five years . '', 
  that says another parent who thinks that the school allows a tradition throw overboard . 
   last week , the discussion flared up after a christmas promo of the dutch public broadcasting ( npo ) in which the word christmas is absent . 
  `` december you celebrate together , '' is the slogan . 
  while last year the npo still used the slogan ` christmas you celebrate together . '', 
  no conscious avoidance of the word christmas , a spokesman stressed . 
  the movie is about the whole `` festive month of december . 
  --  no conscious avoidance of the word christmas , a spokesman stressed . 
  the movie is about the whole `` festive month of december . 
  ** personal note : ** that 's a bad excuse , as the promo does not include any reference to sinterklaas , which is a major fesitivity in december as well , or new-years eve . 
  i started the ( x ways to divide a [ country ] ) thing here on reddit . 
  i think i should change the message we spread on r/europe . 
  we also have an * aardpeer * ( earth pear ) , yet that 's something different : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jerusalem_artichoke, 
  in the meanwhile we are changing the name of certain christmas events , as they might be insulting towards non-christians ... [ ** source ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5jmrsy/markets_open_again_in_berlin_whatever_terrorists/dbi4wh6/ ) ... while the same people argue we should n't let them win . 
  that 's what i call * insanity * . 
  ( yes , i got your vaas reference ), 
   i saw this `` one way to divede x '' trend on the subreddit and thought `` hey , i want in on this action '' it 's time for me to start a new one . 
  so the italians even made it all the way to the russians in the naming of potatoes : \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c : * ( kartofel ' / kartoshka ) * ? 
  although , tomatoes are the same in italian and russian as well , as far as i know . 
  * pomodori * edit : apparently a swiss botanist came up with the name . 
  it 's * aardappel * in dutch . 
  ergo , the austrians are right !, 
  / s kartoffel is from a slavic origin . 
  boris approves, 
  ik zal hieronder gewoon [ een reactie die ik eerder ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/588yuj/us_visitors_to_iceland_20032016/d8z7s6k/ ) in r/europe heb geplaatst , citeren : -- you 'd be baffled . 
  we actually have a weird language . 
  we use consistently use cases , but we do n't learn them as such anymore and no-one knows where they come from . 
  school books are actually switching to the explanation in terms of '' * de * - words '' and '' * het * - words '' , while in reality dutch still has three genders . 
  ^ ( ^ which ^ in ^ 90 % ^ correspond ^ to ^ those ^ in ^ german , ^ but ^ let 's ^ not ^ admit ^ that ) * * 's middags * ( genitive of time masculine ) * * dag des heren * ( genitive masculine ) * * in de loop der tijd * ( genitive feminine ) * * middernacht * ( genitive feminine ) * * heer des huizes * ( genitive neutral ) * * wiens boek is dit ? 
  * ( genitive ) * * ten oosten * ( dative of place neutral ) * * ter zee * ( dative of place feminine ) * * bij dezen * ( dative of preposition ) * * den vaderland trouw * ( dative neutral ) * * zij * ( nominative ) * * hun * ( dative ) * * hen * ( accusative ) * * den koning ge\u00eberd * ( accusative masculine from anthem ), 
  * 1 nom . 
  polska a = true poland polska b = actually territory of forcedly expelled germans ** ducks and hides ... *, 
  what have i done ... . . 
  so many people are going to be triggered on r/europe . 
  inspired by * [ who pays the ferryman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/who_pays_the_ferryman%3f ) * ? 
  so how many honour killings do you still have on crete ? 
  as a pay back for their toll plans !, 
  proud to be trend setter . 
  :p nice work !, 
  anti-terror raids . 
  brussels has seen quite a few of them this year . 
  hm ... nice map you have over there ... ^ ^ ,, 
  to me , most people who speak _ hochdeutsch _ sound like they have braces . 
  somehow i do n't have this impression for austrian accents . 
  oh and get your _ r _ right . 
  wtf ... 
  in case you speak hochdeutsch : says the one who sounds like he 's got braces in . 
  in case you speak bavarian or austrian : ok . 
  nope , falsely translated . 
  nou = now ( even pronounced the same , but for us it has more meanings ) maar = but beetje gek = a bit weird and there 's no _ why _ in that question . 
  for the rest of the sentence he 's been using english words . 
  best example : austrian accents , bavarian , swiss , swabian for the germans as well . 
  somehow _ platduuts _ ( north german accent ) is n't ridiculed that much . 
  limburgish . 
  although i do n't have any problems with it , as it sounds kinda cute , it is the most often ridiculised accent of the country . 
  yeah , i have noticed the two spelling mistakes . 
  made this a bit late in the evening . 
  the police is to guard off antifa demonstrators in case they randomly show up . 
  although ... that police force wo n't be enough for their violence . 
  that 's one damn low flying police helicopter . 
  the point of my reaction is that we do not even have a formal re-evaluation procedure .
