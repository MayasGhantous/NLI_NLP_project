  no one of the convicted with a life sentence has been granted parole anymore in the netherlands since 1969 . 
  parole can only be granted by the king , though all recent requests have been denied . 
   it 's probably 2005 all over again . 
  it 's actually even more ironic : european union leaders , anxious to preserve a landmark cooperation agreement with ukraine , addressed dutch concerns by saying the deal does not give kiev the status of a candidate for membership of the eu . 
  but , the association agreement never did contain a clause in which ukraine was assured eu membership . 
  this is defined by [ article 49 of the lisbon treaty ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/136-article-49.html ) ( a completely different treaty ) so this amendment is useless since there 's nothing to be amended in the association treaty . 
  do you know what we voted against in 2005 ? 
  right : the later called * lisbon treaty * . 
  now it becomes clear to me why the suicide rate is so high among finns . 
  there 's a difference between the life imprisonment in other european countries and the netherlands : * life imprisonment in nl = life imprisonment * life imprisonment in other european countries = possible re-evaluation after ~ 20 years it will be changed in the coming years , as the council of europe recently called our system to be inhumane . 
  i prefer to call some of their far-end policies [ _ `` regressive '' _ ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/regressive_left ) . 
   we both speak weird that potato makes a huge difference though ... 
  it must be the afghan santa . 
  since the countries with a higher gdp in the eu ( sweden and denmark ) have been granted exemptions to some extent and are n't part of the eurozone . 
  i just do n't understand how luxemburg managed to escape this though . 
   ** result : ** decisive strategic dutch victory good ... 
   stealing a phone  years in jail this is n't the philippines , mate . 
  phone and bicycle theft are highly profitable in the netherlands , and if you get caught , you 're most likely to get fined ( + / - $ 300 + costs of stolen property ) or to get community service , unless they discover you have set up a complete darknet market place . 
  that 's why poland can not into space . 
  their scientists are working in the uk , sending potatoes into the atmosphere . 
  i know it is hard to hard to translate some of the terms , as most of the time when i talk about politics , it 's in dutch . 
  liberal , indeed , refers to the most economic right-wing party in the netherlands . 
  i tried to distinguish between the european classical worker 's left ( socialist parties ) and the social liberals ( greens , pro-immigration ) . 
   you 're inherently leftist lol , so not conforming to the political left is an ancestral sin ? 
   you live in a leftist nation defined by what ? 
  our government ? 
  currently we have a left-right broad coalition . 
  the one before was a centre-right coalition . 
  the one before was a centrist . 
  seriously , can someone eli5 to me why some top economists get a hard on of a 2 % annual inflation rate ? 
  i once read a news article which stated that actually only those with big debts ( governments who face a deficit ) profit from an inflation rate , since their debts just shrink over time and it furthermore makes it possible to cheaply lend money . 
  is this some escape for bad governance ? 
   ... what . 
  you claim to be dutch , why do you sound like a trump supporter ? 
  -- * hey yes , i am dutch . 
  should i revoke my dutch citizenship after this statement which you do n't like , since i apparently belong to your safely defined stereotype of trump supporters ? 
  * * in contrast with your reaction , i am willing to elaborate my stance . 
  but it was intended to be stolen ... now it gets juridically complicated , since spy cams are often distributed in the same way , is n't it ? 
  * `` i thought he was a sad and lonely man . 
  '' * ( 17:25 ) from all the intelligence he had gathered , this is the conclusion he made . 
  the naive compassion leftist social liberals are inclined to have is shocking . 
  ( since he 's a film student , chances are quite high he leans leftish . ), 
  for me , all the stereotypes that exist about the archetypical persons interested in stealing a cell phone , are proven to be true in this video . 
  from the persons patrolling in rotterdam , yet lacking the courage to steal it , to the actual person that stole the phone in amsterdam . 
  nevertheless , this video is set-up like a true version of * das leben der anderen * , as this film student turns into a full stasi agent . 
  i am quite sure it will be juridically hard to use this information any more to retrieve the phone ... 
  he literally published his entire life on the internet . 
  although his face has been blurred , his voice has not been altered and thus can be recognised . 
  if i recall correctly , we have had cases in which the suspects have been retrieved by camera footage that was unanonymised published on the internet . 
  the thieves , although proven guilty , were released from custody since they already had paid off their sentence by the loss of privacy . 
  ( we are talking about a normal picture of them . ), 
  let alone , someone 's complete slice of life is published by means of a viral video . 
   tl ; dr film student ** recreates the film [ das leben der anderen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_lives_of_others ) in real life ** ftfy, 
  oh great , did we now start finger pointing on european scale ? 
   the boy , born in the same town in 2004 , i am just saying this in case no one reads the article . 
  still i do not reject any guilt of the immigrant policy , as he might have been radicalised because of immigrants , though an even sadder truth was recently reveiled : the foreigners , who have been living among us for a longer time , are far more orthodox than the newly-arrived immigrants . 
  so , what state exists to distinguish between this `` state of emergency '' and a state in which the entire country is on alert during actual hunt for terrorists , like we have seen after the charlie hebdo attacks ? 
  ** shitpost warning : ** intervention without entering libyan territory : 1 . turn refugee boat 180 degrees around 2 . attach outboard motor 3 . block rudder 4 . jump start engine or would this self-constructed boat construction be classified as a torpedo attack ? 
  \u00c4hm ... ... that was not particularly the kind of dominance and shelter i was referring to ... 
   glorious deutschland can into dominance !, 
  ** runs back into shelter . 
  is there any european subreddit which is not in english ? 
  a subreddit in which redditors can discuss the same kind of topics in another european language , as opposed to infiltrating another country 's subreddit ? 
  he was refused weed in a coffee shop during his last visit to the netherlands . 
  he is probably still pissed about that . 
  [ put this on repeat ] ( http://static.quest.nl/thumbnails/genjarticlebundle/article/fileupload/detail/00/28/89/sinds-wanneer-wonen-we-in-rijtjeshuizen-2889.jpg ) and you get the netherlands . 
   1950/60s it was all ` rijtjeshuizen ' ( semi-detached ) . 
  _ twee-onder-een-kapwoning _  _ rijtjeshuis _ that is what i consider to be semi-detached . 
   turks in the netherlands are the biggest supporters of erdogan 's akp in europe with around 64 % of dutch turks voting akp . 
  partially caused because we also chose the most backwards from the rural side of the country . 
  we selected them in that way back then . 
  there have been other countries who selected immigrants from the coastal parts ( say around izmir and istanbul ), 
  yep and we currently have 2 seats belonging to this ` long arm ' in our house of representatives . 
   danish is retardedly pronounced norwegian ftfy, 
  duolingo truly is an overhyped learning tool , as it gives you plain random phrases without any further structured training . 
  heck , even an unfinished wikibooks project is better than duolingo . 
  we have not been given this option . 
  at least not by our pm . 
  it 's a perfect summary of what his strategy is . 
  he even postponed the debate about the referendum result until after the brexit referendum as , according to rumours ( i have to admit that , i can not remember this has been an official statement ) , it could have a negative outcome and spark anger among eu critics . 
  but after that he has been running , so to say , between brussels and the hague trying to please both . 
  result : nothing changes . 
  in the meanwhile we have heard all kinds of arguments in favour of this agreement , ** including that not ratifying it is the cause of the manslaughter in syria . 
  ** yes he did say this , in a pathetic slip of the tongue , attempting to demonise all the populists . 
  ( press conference october 28th ) not ratifying the agreement = literally hitler killing ice bear babies with base ball bats, 
  our government 's treatment of the result of the referendum on the association agreement with ukraine has been a farce . 
  aside from the practical neglection of the result , postponements and shady argumentation in favour of this treaty , here are some comments on this news article :  european union leaders , anxious to preserve a landmark cooperation agreement with ukraine , will address dutch concerns on thursday by saying the deal does not give kiev the status of a candidate for membership of the bloc , diplomats said . 
   [ ... ]  poland and the czech republic are among those annoyed with the additional dutch demands , as they want to keep open the prospect of future eu membership for ukraine . 
  the association agreement never did contain a clause in which ukraine was assured eu membership . 
  this is defined by [ article 49 of the lisbon treaty ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/136-article-49.html ) ( a completely different treaty ) so this amendment is useless since there 's nothing to be amended in the association treaty . 
   rutte will still face challenges getting the treaty approved at home as his teetering coalition lacks a majority in either of two chambers of parliament , whose parties are gearing up for an election on march 15 . 
  well , here is why . 
  he now tries to explain his voters that the proposed amendment contains the following changes : * * ukraine shall not be provided unanimous military protection anymore * : this was never stated in the association agreement either , so nothing to be amended over here . 
  * * ukrainian work forces shall not be provided access to the eu labour market * : again , this guarantee was not included , so nothing to be amended over here . 
  * * the association agreement shall not oblige to give ukraine financial aid * : we already did . 
  the agreement has partially put in force already , including article 453 , in which the financial aid for ukraine is delineated . 
  furthermore , [ the eu is about to give about 37 bln dollar ] ( http://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/europes-new-challenge-the-battle-to-save-ukraines-economy_2755.html ) on top of [ a bailout of 40 bln dollar that already has been given ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-to-receive-40-billion-in-international-assistance-imf-says-1423730531 ) these `` changes '' will be endorsed , just because they are n't changes actually , yet he tries to sell this story as `` complying with the referendum result '' . 
  furthermore , our coalition is has quite a hard time at this moment , since they lack majority in both chambers . 
  their treatment of the referendum result has damaged this even more . 
  identity crisis,
