  i know and that 's not what i meant . 
  i just meant that the legitimacy of regarding the ruhrgebied as one city is often compared to that of calling the randstad a city . 
  a lot of cities close to each other , with relatively low density population around it . 
  for us , yes , it is different . 
  40 % of the country lives in the conurbation , earning more than 60 % of the gdp . 
  people often divide us into the * randstad * and `` the rest '' . 
  i fail to imagine how this will not lead to an utterly decadent society if everything can be acquired without any effort . 
  a lot of these un conventions have been written to prevent the atrocities of the second world war . 
  they have been written in a time with a completely different mind set . 
  i still have to find reports of polish world war refugees massively abusing immigration policies of host countries . 
  another instance , the council of europe ( not the eu ) , has accused us of being racist in our counterterrorist acts and stated the legislation to convict jihadis violates human rights ... [ ** source ** ( dutch ) ] ( http://www.elsevier.nl/nederland/achtergrond/2016/11/raad-van-europa-nederland-pakt-jihadisten-te-hard-aan-408327/ ) france has been told to neglect human rights because of their state of emergency after the terror attacks . . we are even hindered in our acts to get basic national safety straight . 
  sounds about right for the netherlands . 
  amsterdam is far from a prime city in the netherlands , even if you would take its agglomeration into account . 
  now , if you took the * randstad * as one city , it would be something different ... 
  but that 's the same as taking the * ruhrgebiet * in germany as one city ... 
   german media have said that the ** 17-year-old ** suspected of raping and killing a student may have had a prior arrest for a similar crime . 
   stern claimed that he told authorities at the time he was 17 , the same age reported by authorities in germany ** three years later ** . 
   moreover greek authorities did n't manage to properly register him with fingerprints and so on as there was ** no entry in the eurodac database ** . 
  at this point you start to doubt whether it will still be fruitful to smash more billions of euros in a complex yet failing registration system and highly facilitated hotspots at the border of the eu ... . ( which by the way , sometimes still have n't completed construction like in italy . 
  they are still building those `` hot spots '' ) i know they are not that appealing , but walls kinda have proven to be effective since , say , the stone age ... 
  that 's still nothing if you look at the number on police wanted-lists for regular theft , arson , etc. . . 
  i actually more or less accept that terrorism is a weak argument , as it indeed does not happen that often , but just look at the regular crime stats and what kind of living environment some of these immigrant ghetto 's have now ... 
  i do n't like the fact they gave both +0 and +1 the red colour , as at first glance it seems the entire time zone shifted westwards ... #justdatavisualisationocd,

  the text under ** no more deportations ** describes in a bit politically worded way that the spd-gr\u00fcnen-linke coalition will try to do everything to reduce the amount of deportations from asylum seekers who currently reside within berlin to a zero . 
  i have heard all kinds of stories from a friend from the balkans , yet when someone from the balkans says this is something from a new level , then it must be really bad ...

  maybe you meant something different , but this phrase does not make sense .

   oxfam blames the countries featuring on the list of tax-havens for contributing to the fact that developing countries miss out on many billions in tax receipts because of this evasion . 
  lol , sure , but at the same time we miss out as well .

   wilders wants people of a certain descent out of the country , no matter the qualification , legal status or criminal offense record . 
  then you have completely missed the context of his outings . 
  if by deportation of moroccans with a criminal record in combination with stricter imigration rules , the same final result of less moroccans is achieved , i do n't see any problem . 
  oh , and moroccans have never been a * race * . 
  so , it ca n't even be racist . 
  if i look at western ukraine , we should be * kerstman * + * st. nicolaas * for consistency . 
  i do n't see any problem in that ... 
  it 's systematic , just like simple lego bricks can create a complex structure . 
  i can use the words * vulpen * , * balpen * , * kroontjespen * , * bamboepen * and even know what they roughly mean if i have never seen one of them , since they end on * pen * . 
  you would use : * caneta-tinteiro * , * canetas esferogr\u00e1ficas * , * plumilla * , * c\u00e1lamo * . 
  the germans sometimes take it a bit further , but it is quite logical .

  ftfy, 
  / r/thenetherlands ca n't do anything anymore as soon as / r/de starts a war : they are using our ( shared ) tanks . 
  i was actually looking for this comment . 
  yes , the massive english influence deteriorates our language as well . 
  but , another problem is that the autocorrect of a lot of phone brands are n't that well designed for dutch . 
  autospacing is turned on on android by default and people just go by this and this is now being picked up in normal writing ( on a computer or by hand ) . 
  our major news broadcaster started to change their language style as well , as they are losing ( young ) viewers . 
  i see an increasing number of spacing mistakes in captions or in the news articles they publish online , which might be used deliberately by them . 
  they even try to dismiss the gender ( m/f/n ) of the nouns , which at least are still consistently used in newspapers and more conservative news outlets , such as the flemish news broadcaster . 
  i know that languages are changing over time , but ours is changing rapidly and sometimes for the wrong reasons , of which for the aforementioned ones . 
  it 's nicer when they start with ** reichs ... ** ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) like official instances do in the netherlands . . hehe, 
  using a public computer with a keyboard lay-out that does n't support umlauts ... ... the terror . 
  i particularly like the distinction between the * indikativ * and * konjunktiv i * verb modes , to indicate whether the information is given on first hand or has a secondary source , especially used in the news . 
  * the former ( * sind * ) states a fact , the latter ( * seien * ) indicates that this information has been given by someone else . 
  oh god , i learned so many of these abbreviations by woii games like brothers in arms , which truly tried to accurately use the division names and their equipment names . 
  basically , everything which started with * pz * meant : run . 
   at least it 's easily readable . 
  [ in defence of compound nouns ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5hcngc/austrias_word_of_the_year_2016_is/dazpu1a/ ), 
  we should stress more on the potential of this in dutch during our dutch classes at school . 
  more and more people just go by the limitations of autocorrect of mobile phones nowadays and just insert a space to complete the autocorrection every time . 
  to be honest , i prefer our system of combining noun phrases ( or compound nouns ) since it creates a predictable structure in a sentence , which -- at least for me -- increases reading speed . 
  a usual word order is : [ article ] [ adverb ] [ adjective ] [ noun ] | followed by [ verb / preposition / end of sentence ] after which this process is repeated , or another noun indicates the switch between word role . 
  example : * the very tall boy * ** | ** * gives * ** | ** * the nicely dressed girl * ** | ** * a red coloured present * . 
  ( subject ) ** | ** ( finite verb ) ** | ** ( indirect/dative object ) ** | ** ( direct object ) a set of nouns within the same functional group of the sentence would disrupt the structure for me , especially is two nouns of different functional groups can be expected next to each other , like : * the boy gives the girl presents * . 
  though in english you can have multiple nouns within a functional group , which would actually be only a single noun in dutch or german . 
  when someone mistakenly uses spaces in the compound nouns in a dutch phrase , i actually anticipate on a word with different function . 
  ( switching from the subject to an object , or switching from the subject to the verb ) i consider it to be frustrating when the next noun actually belonged to the preceding noun . 
  germans use capitalisation to even further increase reading speed as the capitalisation highlights the important words of the sentence ( nouns ) . 
  nevertheless , it has to be said that for non-natives the compound nouns can be really hard as for them it is hard to immediately recognise the individual nouns . 
  you need to have a solid vocabulary to be able to chop up the compound nouns in the right places . 
  -- furthermore , incorrect spacing creates funny mistakes in dutch . 
  ** invalidenparkeerplaats ** : parking space for disabled ** invalide parkeerplaats ** : disabled parking space ** laagsteprijsgarantie ** : guarantee on the lowest prices ** laagste prijsgarantie ** : lowest guarantee on prices,
