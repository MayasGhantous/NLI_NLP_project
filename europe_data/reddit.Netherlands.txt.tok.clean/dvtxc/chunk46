  netherlands  belgium even by number of active breweries . 
   seize their assets , send them back . 
  every time you get a speeding ticket in the netherlands , you have to pay additional administration fee . 
  i bet the administration tariff of determining the actual nationality and age and the deportation process in general comprises a lot more costs than printing out a ticket . 
  so yes , i agree . 
  the best and most descriptive explanation of _ `` linksversift '' _ . 
  good lord , that red-red-green coalition will truly be the death of the city . 
  oh * shite * , you are right , mate . . 
   i think this sex act is banned in the uk anyways lmao . 
  ^ ^ oops ^ ^ did ^ ^ i ^ ^ use ^ ^ an ^ ^ abbreviation ^ ^ with ^ ^ * ass * ^ ^ in ^ ^ it ... ^ ^ not ^ ^ allowed ^ ^ in ^ ^ the ^ ^ uk ^ ^ either, 
  this does n't hold for the netherlands . 
  we already had major successes of populist right-wing parties before the financial crisis in the early 2000s . 
  furthermore , this argumentation again suggests that jobless people would be prone to far-right parties . 
  albeit true to a certain extent , the electoral reach of these parties extends well beyond those who have got in financial troubles .

  it 's in amsterdam though , not in delft . 
  you lied to us !!!, 
  prepare for protest road blocks with caravans !, 
  yes . 
  though it is not always the best place to ice-skate on . 
  there are a lot of houses around the canal radiating heat and the bridges keep the space beneath them `` relatively '' warm . 
  so these places freeze last . 
  people usually start on canals outside the city . 
   also in the netherlands we 've been excellent in reducing the influence of the christian church and replacing it with humanist values . 
  half of the dutch citizens are agnostic and wo n't go back to religion . 
  it 's crowded with black-dressed people in my town on sunday . 
   mosques are running empty . 
  funding is being investigated . 
  http://www.npo.nl/zembla/23-11-2016/vara_101380439 it is not from the netherlands , but denmark . 
  nevertheless , it shows some really worrisome processes running in the society and show a complete parallel universe these mosque visitors are living in . 
  [ something like this ] ( http://www.sloepvrienden.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/schermafbeelding-2014-04-27-om-15.53.25.png ) or we do it on a [ big scale during king 's day ] ( http://blog.boothurenamsterdam.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/koninginnedag-2011.jpg ), 
  a movie was being recorded there . 
  it 's a scene of a police pursuit ( you can see two police cars at the rear end of the pursuit ), 
  there are boats . 
  though more in the summer than in the winter . 
  this canal is accessible for non-motorised small boats . 
  during the summer this canal is used by students which have rented some small boat , or rather a barge , and have some party on it while slowly faring through the canals . 
  there was a little bit , but not enough to see on the picture and most of it was gone by 9 o'clock . 
  note that delft is close to the sea . 
  temperatures drop the slowest in this part of the netherlands . 
  not ( accessible ) for motorised ones ... 
  but actually because some of the canals were frozen this morning . 
  where else should we dump our bicycles after use ? 
  we ca n't let them lay on the road , can we ? 
  just wait for [ some milankovitch variables ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milankovitch_cycles ) to come into superposition and some stars to line up and will be sooner [ ** reichzeit ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cvnr9gb.png ) than you think . 
  give that man finally some time to date a girl . 
   schaut 's / sieht 's ah , that makes sense to me now . 
  just like the difference between * auf wiedersehen * and * auf wiederschauen * between north and the south . 
  i give up . 
  do females with a short , kinda boy-ish haircut count as well ? 
  i do n't reject the usage of it in dialects , yet those who use this in the standardised language are usually those who either do n't get a lot of other rules right or just sound like speaking asisprache . 
  and these people do not come from the regions in which these dialects are spoken . 
  that is why is * sounds * stupid to me . 
  i thought our lower house was fragmented , and then i saw slovakia . 
  we 're facing the exact same grammatical fuck up in dutch , which perhaps started in some dialects as well , but is now spreading out to the standard language . 
  it sounds stupid imo . 
  did i pass the bavarian immigration test ? 
  yes , i have heard this explanation before . 
  though what 's wrong with social welfare if being homeless is a better option in their view ? 
  [ red is faring high so far ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8hwyvhp.png ) though as you can see , we 're also facing another problem : extreme fragmentation . 
  [ ** yes ** , it is ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/hm3zmi68o17os/giphy.gif ), 
  i visited hamburg this year . 
  the only city in europe in which i 've seen more homeless people was in moscow or perhaps rome . 
  how do you manage to get that high numbers in hamburg ? 
  you are free to leave if you feel surrounded by * stupid people * . 
  [ except that the purchasing power is nevertheless higher ] ( http://popsop.com/wp-content/uploads/gfk-purchasing-power_-europe-2014.png ) your map shows cities , where these kind of numbers ( when they include rent prices ) are quite often skewed . 
  okay okay ... 
  except for the banking capital of mainland europe , where mostly bank expats get the well-paid jobs . 
  third time 's the charm , is n't it ? 
  let 's be honest . 
  it 's a mere symbolic victory of the left , as the president 's role is actually fairly limited . 
  await the federal elections of austria to see in what direction the country 's legislation will actually be heading . 
  bavaria ( and bw ) is where all the well-paid jobs are . 
  no , it 's just taking a break in the spirit of christmas . 
  apology for stupidity accepted :p, 
  ** + / - 1,2 % ** : jep , it 's safe to say he has won . 
  colonisation through salafist mosques is going according to plan . 
  it is relevant if you have to house these refugees and find out that you have to consider segregation of certain groups or some of them will start fighting each other again . 
  there 's no room to play the devil 's advocate here , as this entire process you delineated here , could be described as * ` repairing the damage the social liberals have left in their trails ' * . 
  seriously , what did these people expect ? 
  the thousandfold repeated incidence of misreported age would stay just an incidental thing ? 
   regressive left a german using this term . 
  you should tell me what town you 're from , so i can come by sometime to have a pint together !, 
  every time i speak with some german friends , word choice becomes like a game of mine sweeper . 
  ** on-topic ** : the dutch government chartered an entire airplane this year to send albanian refugees ( 30 ) back . 
  it had to be filled in a 1:2 ratio with military police ( 70 ) to keep the flight safe and they got a one-time monthly pay check . 
  ( monthly wage in albania ~ $ 200 ) this operation received airtime as if it was a unicum . 
  i can tell you that this is at least not the most efficient way , if you consider the fact that at the same time a similar amount enters the country again . 
   he graduated the community college he attended with high marks before transferring to a state uni , which has a guaranteed transfer system for students from that community college . 
  i actually often hear these kind of stories , with perhaps `` jihadi john '' as the most notorious example , in which these _ terrorists _ actually had pretty rock-solid career prospectives . 
  yet why do so many still refer to the lack of a decent career prospective or poverty as a cause of radicalisation ? 
  yup , they will and they will stay for a long time . 
  somehow our bureaucratic legislature regarding asylum application is so complicated that even if someone has zero chance of staying here , the formal process till deportation takes months . 
  that 's why so many algerian and moroccan ( safe countries ) asylum seekers stay in the northern provinces at this moment , despite the fact that the chance of a successful asylum application from these countries is only 0.5 - 1 % according to the latest stats . 
  speaking of which , has sweden already condemned norway in the nordic council for ` acts against humanity ' ? 
   many of the reasons for expulsion is that the men are older than they themselves have specified this should be a valid reason to be rejected asylum in more countries . 
  they do this deliberately to acquire extra protection and benefits . 
  the simplest comparison i can make is : if i consistently lied to the tax office i would get in trouble if they found out . 
  yet some people still justify the lying by asylum seekers . 
  coming in illegal is one thing .
