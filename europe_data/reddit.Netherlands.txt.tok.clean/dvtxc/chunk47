  coming in illegal ** and ** persist lying is a bridge too far . 
  hopefully they will also address the beheadings , genital mutilation and torture practiced by locals on thousands of dutch colonialists . 
  ( a great in-depth story was published in the weekly news magazine _ elsevier _ a few months ago ) or will that be too controversial ? 
  netherlands can into relevance !, 
  annexate pakistan before destroying that rock . 
  a lot of students use the university as a true study place and most universities in the netherlands offer plentiful very good ict-facilities . 
  sure , you 'll have your own desk , but you can get quite efficient . 
  :p no , i did n't include them as kitchen and bathroom are usually shared with other tenants : can be with two others , or over 10 other tenants if you decide to get a room in so-called * fraternity * houses . 
  there are also bigger apartments with own kitchen and bathrooms ( total of around 20 - 24m ^ 2 ) , though these are usually managed by a central student housing organisation and they have very long waiting lists , ( can go up to 4-5 years ) so you have to enrol for them before starting your studies , which in turn is n't allowed in every city . 
  yes , if you take a look at sites that offer student rooms , you 'll find a lot of offered rooms of just about 10 m ^ 2 . 
  it 's also a quite common room size in the biggest student cities of the netherlands , like amsterdam and utrecht . 
  i will really notice it if someone 's room deviates from this size . 
   just wanted to point out , that the 350 a month for 10 m2 is n't the case anywhere . 
  i 'll have to move soon . 
  i 'll do anything to get just that , as my search attempts have n't been that fruitful . 
  i 've mostly been invited to just decent-ish rooms with prices over $ 400 and with the surprise that i 'll have to add all the utilities on top of that price . 
  rotterdam is n't the typical * student city * in the netherlands , even though it has one / two-ish universities . 
  ( if you count eur and emc as separate universities , and despite that : they offer a very limited amount of studies ) try to find something like that in amsterdam , utrecht , leiden or delft . 
   berlin is safe . 
  do you have some other statistics on that last topic , as * halten sie ihre stadt f\u00fcr sicher ? 
  * is a subjective measure , is n't it ? 
  though i would say that it 's definitively impressive for a big city like munich to be that high ranked . 
  the feel of security seem mostly to be inversely related to population size . . 
  as in , numbers of squatting people ? 
  just look at reykjavik . 
  they 've translocated that city across the country . 
  it 's the balkans after all . 
  if you 're studying in the netherlands , prepare for a lot of student rooms of about 8 to 14 m ^ 2 . 
  if you 've more than that , i will come in with a `` wow '' . 
  polish does not seem to be that far fetched , when compared to what we offer ... 
  in principle , school students can take arabic , russian or chinese * as an official examination subject during the finals at schools in the netherlands . 
  ( i.e. 
  it will be accredited on your school diploma and the exams are made by a central official authority ) official foreign language examination subjects comprise : english , german , french , latin , ancient greek , spanish , arabic , russian and chinese . 
  additionally schools are allowed to offer other electives , yet they wo n't be examined centrally at the finals . 
  schools do ** not ** have to offer all languages . 
  only english , german and french are mandatory for all schools , as these are mandatory for all pupils for a minimum of 3 years . 
  additional languages can be offered by schools , and some schools even promote themselves for having more electives to offer . 
  for those who are interested , this is how these exams look like : * arabic 2016 finals : [ texts ] ( https://www.examenblad.nl/examendocument/2016/cse-1/arabisch-vwo/bijlage/2016/vwo/f=/vw-1009-a-16-1-b.pdf ) | [ question sheet ] ( https://www.examenblad.nl/examendocument/2016/cse-1/arabisch-vwo/opgaven/2016/vwo/f=/vw-1009-a-16-1-o.pdf ) * ancient greek 2016 finals : [ texts ] ( https://www.examenblad.nl/examendocument/2016/cse-1/grieks-vwo/bijlage/2016/vwo/f=/vw-1011-a-16-1-b.pdf ) | [ question sheet ] ( https://www.examenblad.nl/examendocument/2016/cse-1/grieks-vwo/opgaven/2016/vwo/f=/vw-1011-a-16-1-o.pdf ) * russian 2016 finals : [ texts ] ( https://www.examenblad.nl/examendocument/2016/cse-1/russisch-vwo/bijlage/2016/vwo/f=/vw-1007-a-16-1-b.pdf ) | [ question sheet ] ( https://www.examenblad.nl/examendocument/2016/cse-1/russisch-vwo/opgaven/2016/vwo/f=/vw-1007-a-16-1-o.pdf ) we have quite some polish people living in the netherlands . 
  i do n't necessarily see why polish could n't be taught over here if there enough teachers are present to make this an option at some schools . 
  though as you can see , most of our language electives are based on the number of speakers in the world of that particular language and the economic importance of those languages .

  same accounts for [ dutch criminal law ] ( http://juribus.eu/nemo-tenetur-beginsel-cautie/ ) as it has been included in the international human rights agreement . 
  i have also found the name of this ` right ' : * nemo tenetur * international human rights agreement of 1966 : art . 
  14.3 : ** not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt . 
  when did i see an * europhilic * foreign minister in a newspaper for the last time ? 
   at one time , according to dutch laws restaurants had to close earlier . 
  for some restaurants on the border this simply meant that the customers had to move to a table on the belgian side .

  why ? 
  is there some dutch stinginess involved in this ? 
  i know we have been replacing a lot of traffic signs recently to make them fully colour-blind compliant , [ by introducing an extra thin white outer ring ] ( http://www.verkeerspro.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/verkeersbordmetwitterand.jpg ) to a lot of traffic signs , so the outer shape can be distinguished from a green , say leafy , background by those who have red-green colour blindness and inner colours can be distinguished by those who have red-blue colour blindness . 
  still , our traffic lights are fucked up . 
  we need to use the german system with red ** and ** amber before green so you do n't have to continuously watch that light and panic drop the clutch and go full throttle as soon as it goes on green if you 're first in the queue . 
  it goes against one of the very basic human rights in criminal law , as it can be seen as conducing your own prosecution in an interrogation . 
  it is similar to the [ miranda warning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miranda_warning ) , also known as * `` the right to remain silent '' * .

  this particular combination makes me shiver in every news article . 
  we should n't make any predictions until at least after march 15th . 
  you know , there 's a friend of le pen polling high and previous foreign success can heavily influence those election results . 
  oh boy , this escalated quickly : just eradicate all concurrents !, 
  we 'll make entire zeeland into one big harbour and annoy hamburg even more . 
  ** dear mods : ** inprecise translation of the title of the news article intended -- google translate : https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fnos.nl%2fl%2f2145414&amp;edit-text=  king philip today takes a special gift with during his state visit to the netherlands : a piece of belgium . 
  today both countries sign a treaty on a border adjustment in limburg . 
    the belgian peninsulas presqu'ile de l'llal and presqu'ile d'eijsden be exchanged for the dutch peninsula petit gravier . 
  as a result , net netherlands about 10 hectares larger . 
    it is the second boundary adjustment between the netherlands and belgium in 175 years . 
  this adjustment is necessary because by straightening the winding meuse the three areas in 1961 suddenly came to be on the wrong side of the border . 
    that led to small pockets of lawlessness , because belgian police officers only by boat or via a detour and could come with the consent of the netherlands at l'llal . 
  local residents complained about nuisance caused by illegal parties , drug dealers and sex tourists in the park . 
    although there are no people live or buildings stand , took adjust that situation still a lot of work , says theo bovens governor of the province of limburg . 
  it was a tough job because there are many parties involved . 
  `` not only the ministries of both countries , but also water states , the land registry , the provinces , three municipalities and states . 
  you can imagine what it involves . '', 
    if both parliaments adopt the treaty next year , the exchange a reality on january 1 , 2018 . 
  bovens is quite proud of that result . 
  `` you do not see so often that changing borders without firing a shot , but there was an excellent collaboration . '',

    tonight the king gives a state banquet in honor of his belgian guests .
