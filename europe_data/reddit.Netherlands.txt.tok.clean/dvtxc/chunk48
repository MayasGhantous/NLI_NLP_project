  the number of posts about the netherlands are skyrocketing here on r/europe . 
  sorry could n't resist posting this off-topic comment . 
  i look for taz . 
  ( also heard of for the first time ) just scan trough some articles , within 1 minute i find banners promoting communism and a report called * `` tv-berichterstattung in ard und zdf \u00fcber die silvesternacht 2015/2016 in k\u00f6ln '' * carried out by * `` gunda-werner institut f\u00fcr feminismus und geschlechterdemokratie '' * . 
  the conclusions in the report gave me enough internet for today ... 
  mind to elaborate ? 
  just heard of jf for the first time because of the comment by u/seruun and actually spent some time on quite interesting reads ... 
  the articles are not written in clickbaity tabloid style , and would even consider -- according to my german proficiency -- quite well written . 
  i recognise a lot of topics from other newspapers and it is interesting to read about them from another perspective . 
  political spectrum according to the bbc : counterprotesters , left , centre-left , centre , economic liberal , populist far-right, 
  estonia , any interest in selling * swamp valley * ? 
  do you know that those companies even hire people to find uploads that infringe copyright ? 
  there was a reddit ama on that job once . . 
  underrated comment was subtle reference to belgian obsession with frying potatoes . 
  actually , it might come from burcht =  burg =  berg as well ... 
  we should form a peleton though , at least take the wind out of this ride . 
  and make sure there are plentiful resupply stations on the road to the top . 
  you wan na make sure to replenish body fluid because of all that sweating . 
  i even forgot `` lopik '' , which sounds similar to : looppik : * dripping dick * or * walking dick *, 
  i know bro ... got ta get my bike in the lightest gear , i 'll be sweating and soaked once i reach the top . 
  i see no harm in having shops opened on sundays , though there was a map and discussion on this subject here on r/europe a few weeks ago . 
  but it 's not really the underlying principle of their rejection and it does not justify the prohibition of elections on a sunday , as elections are on average a mere yearly event . 
  ( considering : national , provincial , municipal , european and water board ) that does not damage this sunday rest that much ... 
  you should tell them . 
  these are the same people that prohibit shops to open on sunday in some municipalities . 
  they truly regard working on a sunday as an act against the word of god . 
  i also do n't think the catholics would reject elections on a sunday . 
  i just hope they will change it some time in the near future . 
  these regulations are the remnants of politics that have been dominated by confessional parties . 
  but some orthodox calvinistic peeps in some shitholes in our country do not . 
  it 's actually our translation of * `` neverland '' * or * `` never neverland '' * of peter pan 's fantasy world : [ nooitgedachtland ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/nooitgedachtland ), 
  [ we got a shit ton of them ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ej1wr/some_dutch_city_names/dacwqg2/ ), 
  i do n't know . 
  it is a common name in the northern netherlands as well . 
  you forgot : * waspik : * washing dick * * lopik : * dripping dick * or * walking dick * * krimpen : * to shrink * * hoek van holland : * holland 's corner * * lekkerkerk : * delicious church * * beverwijk : * beaver borough * * beverland : * beaver land * * hoorn : * horn * * roermond : * stirr in the mouth * ( hehehe , i know it 's different ) * zuidbroek : * southern pants * * 's hertogenbosch : * the duke 's forest * * huizen : * houses * and all the mountains : * bergen ( noord holland ) : * mountains * * bergen ( limburg ) : * mountains * * berg : * mountain * * driebergen : * three mountains * * steenbergen ( noord brabant ) : * stone mountains * * steenbergen ( drenthe ) : * stone mountains * * haaksbergen : * straight mountains * * bergen op zoom : * mountains at the edge * * bergen aan zee : * mountains at the coast * * berg en dal : * mountain and valley * * berghuizen : * mountain houses * * hardenberg : * hard mountain * * beekbergen : * brook mountains * * bergambacht : * mountain craft * * bergharen : * mountain hairs * you 'd think we got the himalayas over here, 
  [ ** source to full article ** ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2016/47/krijgen-mannen-en-vrouwen-gelijk-loon-voor-gelijk-werk - ) | dutch - published : october 23th , 2016 [ google translation of the source ] ( https://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.cbs.nl%2fnl-nl%2fnieuws%2f2016%2f47%2fkrijgen-mannen-en-vrouwen-gelijk-loon-voor-gelijk-werk-&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) translations of the image captions : * title : ** difference in average hourly wage of women w.r.t. 
  men according to age in 2014 . 
  ** * overheid : ** public sector / government ** * bedrijfsleven : ** private sector ** -- google translate :  #get men and women equal pay for equal work ? 
    there are differences in pay between men and women , but the differences are largely explained by characteristics such as educational level , occupational level , having part-time or full-time work and work experience . 
  moreover , the differences are smaller , partly by rising educational attainment of women . 
  so make young women more than young men . 
  this is evident from the survey cbs ` equal pay for equal work ? 
  '' , which pay differences are adjusted for twenty relevant characteristics . 
  or the differences that remain can not be determined with this study after making this adjustment related to sex discrimination or other causes . 
    taking into account the background characteristics twenty women earned by the government in 2008 , 7 percent less than men . 
  in 2014 this had fallen to 5 percent . 
  in business , the difference decreased during this period from 9 to 7 percent . 
    without taking into account the various background characteristics , the figures show a similar trend , although the pay gap bigger . 
  women in government in 2008 earned 16 percent less than men in 2014 was 10 percent . 
  in business , the difference decreased during this period from 22 to 20 percent . 
    ** hourly wages higher in government **   to determine the difference in pay , without looking at the connection with various background characteristics , the average gross hourly wage is used . 
  this is different for the two sectors . 
  average wages for men and women are higher in the public sector ( 26 euros for men and 24 for women ) than in industry ( 21 and 17 euros respectively ) . 
    ** young women earn more **   without taking into account background featuring young women earn on average more than their male colleagues of the same age . 
  for older workers is the other way around . 
   when the government is the age when men earn more than women higher than in business . 
  in 2014 , women earned by the government from 36 years less than their male peers . 
  in business was the turning point in 30 years . 
   that young women have a higher hourly rate than young men depends to a large extent to the fact that young women are better educated than young men . 
  for older workers ( from 45 years ) the level of education among men is higher than among women and in addition will factors such as work experience and professional level play a greater role . 
  in terms of numbers and salaries older group dominates still the overall employee population . 
    ** catching women **   all ages seem to be around women working in government catching up . 
  in 2008 , earned a 50-year-old woman there on average 20 percent less than a male colleague of fifty years . 
  in 2014 , the pay gap had fallen to 13 percent . 
  such catching applies to a lesser extent for women in business . 
  since the difference decreased during this period from 30 to 27 percent . 
   wenn am n\u00e4chsten ** sonntag ** landtagswahl w\u00e4re ... some people would be truly infuriated in the netherlands if we had elections on a sunday . 
  imagine having elections on * `` de dag des heren '' * . 
  why do we always need to have elections on a wednesday ?? 
  either you have to go to a polling booth before work , early in the morning , or during lunch break , or after work ... like . 
  seriously ? 
  joke by people who have n't heard of the name frauke before , i guess ... 
  eu ferry services ltd. 
  yes , there 's a reason we even have special companies that help consumers to import cars from the german market and exploit loopholes in the law to maximise the benefit of imported cars over the regular dutch market price with taxes ... 
  registration tax is so low in germany . 
  i see them on a daily basis . 
  the bicycle joke . 
  all-time classic . 
  you mean , they are ditching the genitive in favour of the dative . 
  not the other way round . 
  and even that does not occur everywhere . 
  more in the south than in the north . 
  yep , heard that one on the radio today as well for the first time . 
  so even though we are ahead of everyone else in europe , it sounded really dramatical as if we should start to act now , or otherwise ... . 
  we are buffing ourselves up for harsher times !, 
  most times the people visiting the gp are the problem . 
  they go to the gp as soon as they have a simple flu , while there is hardly anything you can do against that besides * letting the flu pass * . 
  can confirm the other way round : i was kinda shocked when i got different kinds of antibiotics prescribed once in greece after an infection . 
  upon re-evaluation by my own gp in the netherlands he mentioned all the possible side effects those antibiotics could have had , and that the dosis was actually too high and posed a risk of doing damage . 
  everytime i feel depressed , i open a chart on r/europe . 
  he will need 1 . 
  more than 50 % of the votes , as most parties oppose a possible coalition . 
  a majority in the upper house 3 . 
  more than 50 % of the votes in the next elections , as constitutional changes need 2 rounds , i.e. 
  approval by two cabinets . 
  i thought we would use the term * frogxit * for france ? 
  well , looking at the distribution , it seems that we 've a mere evenly spread-out distribution of the gdp per capita , whereas you have either some rich , or quite less developed regions . 
  2002 ... 14 years ago . 
  damn , time is passing by fast . 
  how different could times in the netherlands have been if he was n't assassinated before those elections .
