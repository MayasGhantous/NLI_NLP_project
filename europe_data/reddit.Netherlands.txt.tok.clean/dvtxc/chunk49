   most observers agree that the likely outcome of the election is a coalition of four or five center-right and center-left parties . 
  let 's reintroduce the very typical dutch process of * polderen * . 
  some coalitions in the 60 's and 70 's were this big as well . . 
  ** lekker ** and no , it does not only mean * delicious * * * litt . 
  i do n't have to explicitly state that one here , do i ? 
  norwegian has the same . 
   while over on the mainland europe they drowning in it what snow ? 
  it 's 13 degrees over here ... 
  by this reasoning cuba would be the example to follow ? 
  do n't underestimate my fascination for rocks ... 
  upvoted because the netherlands are exactly one position ahead of finland . 
  east prussia xd, 
  i have yet to find the first openly pro-putin stance outed in the party programme of the dutch freedom party ... 
  this map is bollocks at best . 
  apparently you have to take note of the small asterisks as well . 
  i actually find * denk * to be a much more misleading name for a party that says to be rational . 
  ** books flight to thorshavn before the f\u00e6r\u00f6er get mainstream . . *, 
  and i thought [ yr.no ] ( http://www.yr.no ) had a pretty website and graphical visualisation ... ( i actually prefer yr.no over the local weather websites . ), 
  make a contest . 
  r/europe and r/vexillology / are big enough for that ... 
  [ i actually associated them with the danes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8msdeybohk ), 
  sealand does n't include _ zeeland _ . 
  i 'm quite disappointed . 
  my ocd is a bit triggered by the lack of * transalpina * . 
  we need new flairs on r/europe !, 
   no , he is polling 15-20 % and i think that number will go down . 
  ~ ~ rememberme ! ~ ~ march 15th 2017 `` do n't trust the pollsters '', 
  i 've seen those more often . 
  even in dutch we refer to them as * russische federatie * and * isl . 
  republiek iran * in official publications . 
  it 's just the first time i see the name * slovak republic * written out like that . 
  because i know that at least the czechian government once urged other countries to refer to them as * czechia * instead of * czech republic * . 
  at the same time , i have n't seen the name * slovak republic * ... 
  douze points !, 
  * slovak republic * ? 
  what 's wrong with slovakia ? 
  well in that case , i would like to see some article on r/europe that states that danes are better at math than the dutch ... ... 
  ay , and make every ship that wants to leave/enter the baltic sea pay toll . 
  lol , do n't inspire trump to rename the white house . 
  [ ** when the netherlands is on par or even above other scandinavian countries in the many recent listings on r/europe ** ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/591/928/94f.png ), 
  you still engage in circle meetings on some prominent rock for daily politics , do n't you ? 
  #hanseatic league revives !, 
  frisian might be closer . 
  rejected in final round . 
  if we acquire your country , does that mean we consecutively inherit f\u00e6r\u00f6er , greenland and sk\u00e5ne as well ? 
  helloooo , welkom to heedrrraulic prrrress channel . . todayh we arrrh going to crrrrrush datah . 
  ve must deel whit itt . 
  there is a world of difference between those two . 
  there is even a difference in english accent between native dutch and native flemish dutch speakers . 
  for almost every other non-english language they do . 
  ** reads flair first * ** reads comment secondly * ** laughs out loud . 
  if it comes down to the consistency of pronunciation you 're right about german except for the pronunciation of the `` s '' , which can be a * `` s '' : ** s ** ph\u00e4re , da ** s ** * `` z '' : ** s ** ehen * `` sh '' : ** s ** tein ( if you 'd express it in our spelling ) . 
  i kinda feel when what pronunciation the `` s '' has in german , but i would have a hard time to explain that to someone else . 
  acquiring a bit of maturity before getting a drivers license ? 
  i do n't see the problem in that . 
  it 's safer than the other way round in my opinion . 
  it has always been sixteen ... until 4 years ago . . 
  colour  color, 
  from then on we will just provide the next revised edition of the oxford dictionary and perceived pronunciation guide lines . 
  take that , danskj\u00e4vlar !,

   fear the german and his saur kraut smells !, 
  calm down ... we can handle this . 
  we have once withstood a german invasion for a whole 7 days !, 
  2129 years `` pay debts ! '', 
  from this day on , greece has officially been declared * eternal vassal state of merkelreich * . 
  ^ ^ there ^ ^ is ^ ^ no ^ ^ written ^ ^ evidence ^ ^ in ^ ^ the ^ ^ world ^ ^ history ^ ^ of ^ ^ any ^ ^ country ^ ^ being ^ ^ a ^ ^ vassal ^ ^ state ^ ^ for ^ ^ 2 ^ ^ millennia . 
  ah well ... we were at least not part of that during most of the time , so i could live with that . 
   it will be if eastern european countries decide to drop the eu and align with russia because they feel the west does not have their back anymore . 
  the intrinsic hate of russia in some eastern european countries makes this a very unlikely scenario in my opinion . 
  first of all , i do n't see the baltic states changing their stances towards russia in the foreseeable future . 
  when looking at countries such as bulgaria and romania , it becomes clear that these countries are still energetically to dependent on russia ( gas ) to fully develop their economy independent of russia . 
  political swings will be a lot less susceptible if they address that . 
  if there is some slight hostility towards the current eu internal politics , it would be in the visegrad group , yet even they have a known history of detesting russian political intervention . 
  you might keep an eye on serbia , yet they do not belong to the eu at this moment either . 
  indeed , if they call merkel 's politics of , say , the year 2015 the * pax germanica * , then i 've absolutely no idea of what they perceive to be * pax * , nor do i understand why the election of trump would suddenly end this * pax * ( unless they mean it in the ironic way ), 
   europe is a region currently beset by crises , including the increasingly authoritarian regimes in russia and turkey , eu acrimony , a weak french government , and a brexiting britain . 
  i do n't deny that the russian aggression is a problem , yet i do n't see that as a major crisis in western european countries at this very moment . 
  i find the recent realisation that so many people with a foreign background in western countries are still loyal to the authoritarian regime of erdogan and the other recent divisive demographic event which was partially catalysed by merkel much more worrisome . 
  the fact that the latter two are responsible for the divisiveness is only sporadically addressed by the main stream media , yet pose a much larger threat to the eu . 
  you should consider hoping to be reincarnated as an ant in the afterlife . 
  i thought only serbia was openly pro-putin at this moment ... 
  norway . 
  there is a quote for the amount of nynorsk and bokm\u00e5l on national television . 
   since the netherlands is more on the subbing side i assume it 'd shock you . 
  i really detest dubbing , but not because it prevents one from getting more in touch with another language ( in many cases english ) . 
  i dislike it , as it alters an original work , discarding the original audio track and therefore * damaging * the integrity of an original art work . 
  one should always broadcast films in their original form . 
  only children 's films are dubbed in the netherlands , because there is a practical limitation in broadcasting those films with their original foreign audiotrack . 
  even in those cases , cinemas offer an non-dubbed alternative . 
  disney films , for example , will always have two versions in the cinema , with the dubbed version usually displayed a little bit earlier on the day , so younger children can see the film , whereas the non-dubbed version will be displayed a little bit later on the day or in the evening . 
  when it comes to dubbing reports of eye witnesses in the news , it does damage to the original phrasing of those people and makes checking the original context harder . 
  lol , if we imposed language quotas that limited the amount of english loan words per phrase , you could basically skip a major part of radio and tv airtime . 
  i experience that more and more students prefer to hold meetings fully in english when discussing projects as they feel more comfortable speaking english than dutch , even if no international student is present . 
  it is actually a bit sad imho ... 
  according to the comments i read , a map showing the countries which do not have a `` liberal '' head of state .
