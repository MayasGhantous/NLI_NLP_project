  buy fast selling concert tickets , resell them , get a tenfold of the original price ... profit . 
  occupied :p, 
  yep , i admit i forgot about that . . 
  would be even more confusing . 
  now we can finally call england by its true name . 
  to all the friends [ in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5b4cwt/poland_belarus_eu_and_georgia_are_the_top_most/d9lmcnz/ ) :d, 
   the smallest country in the eu ( at the time ) hosts the largest and highest form of govenrment . 
  it means fuck all . 
  wait wut , not luxemburg ? 
  i got this . 
  so i can call you r\u00e4memaa , l\u00e4hteikk\u00f6maa or suomaa ? 
  but actually , now i pronounce it , it makes sense . 
  the * t * in na ** t ** ional - is actually pronounced as a * ts * , which is not that far from how the * z * is often pronounced in german . 
  this got offtopic ... xd, 
  coming from the common ancestral language : * dietsch * , to make it even more confusing . 
  hm , they are supporters of ** nazi ** smus after all ... 
   alankomaat dafuq is this word ? 
  again , winter weather favours the russian side in a war . 
  that term has exclusively been reserved for greeks . 
  lol , honestly , sound like what 's going wrong with the education over here as well . 
  just an example : there 's this kind of sat final test pupils do when they 're about 12 years old to see what kind of secondary school level they should go to . 
  political stances and regulations on this test seem to change every 4 years . 
  edit ; excuse me for my quintuple double post . 
  connection got stuck in a weird way . 
  we have oil and gas -- lots of gas -- and are n't that warm either . 
  now what ? 
   but as far as i know the region around limburg is a bit of an outlier in the netherlands in terms of dialects . 
  their intonation is funny and cute at the same time . 
  they `` sing '' a bit . 
   i think in dutch it 's `` hen '' ? 
  similar `` it '' is `` et '' in cologne compared to `` es '' in normal german and `` het '' ( ? ), 
  in dutch . 
  ` er ' = * hij * ( similar pronunciation to * hei * ) * hen * is our formal 3rd person plural accusative , though in colloquial speech * ze * is used more often , which is closer to your ` sie ' . 
   even here we have stuff like `` lecker '' having a broader meaning in the cologne dialect compared to standard german that seems pretty close to the dutch `` lekker '' hahaha , try to say * ` schlaf lecker ' * and germans will look really weird at you , though yes , for us that word is really multifunctional . 
  but not all of them speak [ * afrikaans * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afrikaans ) . 
  speaking with people under the age of 30 feels it has become obsolete ... and that feeling rapidly gets stronger as time passes . . 
  but anyways , do n't forget that we are still the third largest germanic language by number of native speakers ( 23 mln ) . 
  if you include afrikaans we are at about 30 mln . 
  fuu , we must seize the territory that has the inclination to become the next 7 as soon as possible then !, 
   i 'm making a guess it would be written like asociaal in dutch ? 
  correct the first time i heard * asi * , i thought the person referred to an abbreviation for the term * asiat * , because i did n't expect * asozial * to be abbreviated like that . 
  :p  it 's obvious of course that they would share quite a lot of similarities they do a lot yes , though you just have to strip off some grammar . 
  but it surely does depend on dialect perhaps . 
  if people would stop classifying plattdeutsch ( low german ) as german for example , it would be already a lot more logical . 
  since i 've noticed we are usually able to understand those dialects as if they are just farmers speaking dutch . 
  i actually read it as the dutch derogatory term * aso 's * , which means something like * ` rude chavs ' * . 
  would actually fit as well . 
  agreed ... [ ... as we would apparently not entirely fit in this data ] ( https://youtu.be/p2hjlx_fvzg?t=230 ), 
   `` holland 2.0 '' this implies belgium is a further developed and evolved version from us ... 
  i am triggered , denmark ... / s, 
  that 's what i meant by on paper . 
  i only realise now that this does n't translate so well into english , but we often use the word * paper * as substitution for official documents . 
  lol . 
  wow , take it easy mate ... 
  if he is here to stay , he surely can become dutch by definition . 
   french federalist wut ? ...

  i bet we are somehwere at the bottom of this chart after this whole referendum we have had here . 
  morgens . 
  oh god why ... 
  oh my god . 
  do people still use these ? 
  that just does n't compute for me . 
  humans are better in remembering patterns than remembering larger numbers . 
  spelling out phone numbers by single numbers is easier since you only have to memorise the pattern , while the digits from 0 to 9 can be mapped to a location , for example their usual location on a phone keypad . 
  you ca n't map 100 numbers to a location . 
  let 's not start about the danish counting system . 
  please , for the sake of logic and mankind . 
  first in the world ? 
  [ we have already had autonomous public transport on a public road since 2005 . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/parkshuttle ) you 're 11 years late finland . 
  long distance autonomous public transport is currently being tested in public as well in the netherlands . 
  i just hate the people who give their phone numbers in that way . 
  some even use numbers in the hundreds range . 
  norwegian still uses both systems after an attempt to switch , if i remember correctly ... 
  same here : * drie\u00ebnnegentig * i do n't understand the logic behind it , yet i have to carefully switch systems when i speak other languages than dutch or german . 
  secretly , that 's our actually most visited website . 
  but if those sites had been included in this map , the whole map would n't mention google , vk or youtube even once , iykwim ... 
  apparently something like our [ startpagina.nl ] ( http://www.startpagina.nl ) only computers that have n't been updated since windows 98 , with the first archaic build of internet explorer installed on it , most probably still have this page as their homepage . 
  the j is actually not a consonant here , but part of a diphthong * ij * , a little bit similar to the * ei * in german . 
  for us , the * ei * and * ij * have similar pronunciation , yet they remain their different spelling because of different etymology . 
  actually , a long time ago the * i * and * j * formed a * y * together . 
  that 's why you sometimes will find older spellings like * ysselmeer * . 
  # ~ ~ triggered ~ ~ getrekkerd ... 
  just do n't even give them a chance to speak in english . 
  :p total amount is displayed on a screen . 
  some supermarkets even have an automatic exchange machine for coins . 
  the only remaining question is : _ `` kvitto ? 
  [ how i imagine danish people to speak english ] ( https://youtu.be/pdfgd_qyhdo?t=68 ), 
  we are like : what renewables ? 
  * how about pumping some more natural gas from our glorious reserves ?!, 
  we shall fight russian dependency our own way !, 
  '' * the others seem to be unknown to me ... -- with a slight variation on another one that is mentioned on that site , we use : * `` als een kip zonder kop . 
  '' * like a chicken without a head . 
  you have no idea how much we are complaining about our health care system . 
  ( although , we are known to complain about just anything .
