   we get to nod and say yes . 
  accept as many people as get sent our way , get everything ready and when they leave or just do n't show up , we can just shrug . 
  it 's worse . 
  say something out loud , even questioning this policy , and you risk losing your social contacts or career . 
  way too often i hear ( death ) threats , even though some as a joke , by students at ** universities ** , mocking those who have anti-immigration stances . 
  it is not a matter of ` we * can * just shrug ' , but you * shall * just shrug . 
  would you mind providing the link to this picture and/or some articles about this ? 
  as a tax paying dutchman i feel kinda insulted . 
  at this moment , [ about 50 000 ] ( https://www.vluchtelingenwerk.nl/feiten-cijfers/cijfers/bescherming-nederland ) get food , warm home , clothes and money and they do n't even need to work or contribute anything to society ... ... and quite a few of them , most probably only come since they know they are assured of getting all of those aforementioned benefits and i am not allowed to say anything of that without losing the majority of my social contacts . 
  fuck all of them . 
  ( yes , i know persons that have lived in these centres personally . 
  they have told me the story of some lurking immigrants in those centres . 
  one day without all the free benefits and they will complain more than the most arrogant russian tourist in a turkish holiday resort . ), 
   loved christmas there . 
  it was not racist . 
  what did santa claus from lapland do wrong ? 
  i recommend you to read [ this story ( dutch ) ] ( http://www.elsevier.nl/opinie/opinie/2016/11/vrijheid-is-voorbij-als-gekwetste-minderheid-de-baas-wordt-2913936w/ ) and [ this story ] ( https://medium.com/@nntaleb/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#.97r8imxi7 ) . 
  just because a portion of the population does n't mind the appearance of pete that much , it should be considered to be a worrisome process if traditions are being changed by an intolerant minority . 
  these people seriously should get a job or something ... 
  among them there are some people who are full-time protestors . 
  over the past few years they have begun to spoil a children 's festival and are backed up by the media . 
  never during my whole childhood i considered this party or the person * black pete * to be racist , until i heard about these protesters . 
  even ` coloured ' friends i had at that time liked the party very much . 
  there is even a beautiful story behind this party that the saint liberated the petes from slavery and offered them great living conditions . 
  by introducing the story that they have become black over time , because they climb through chimneys , they lose a great opportunity to actually use their appearance and the original story as some small remembrance of liberation from slavery . 
  instead , these protestors only want us to believe that they should be paid compensations for our atrocities . 
  it has been a festival of children , generosity and liberation , yet these protesters have turned it into a festival of racism , hate and division , backed by the media , ridiculing those who would like to keep the tradition for being old-fashioned and not progressive . 
  good job . 
  apart from what your opinion on these lads is , i am genuinely interested in how drinking a pint with these guys is . 
  oh god why . 
  does she want to overtake us in population density ? 
  so apparently , i had the chance to meet u/u _ ve_been_trolled this morning at exactly this location . 
  we 'll send in our mountaineers from limburg to complete the invasion within a day . 
  after that we will invade belgium from the direction they expect us least : from luxemburg . 
  not only did you included eastern europe into russia , you also gave them a nice commie colour . 
  some people are going to be triggered af . 
   pure * ` cucumber time ' * news ` silly season ' , 
   ah no we got one shortly thereafter , it was just a scheme to get rid of the dutch . 
  guys . 
  prepare the invasion . 
  let 's reclaim those money laundering hills in the south . 
  stop ordering milk , goddammit !, 
  i do n't think you got the reference : a * fin * is dutch internet slang for a moroccan or a dutch person with moroccan immigration background . 
  it originates from a parody on politicians and media failing or even dodging to name the problem . 
  somehow the demonym of * fin * stuck . 
  probably as they are seen as the antipole of moroccans , regarding both appearance and criminal record . 
  give it to denmark . 
  they know how to handle them . 
  everyone knows uganda is part of the eu ... / s, 
  asterisks , * because ... empire * , video subject . 
  something in me says this guy has watched cgpgrey 's videos . 
  let this sink in in the first place : soldiers , truly sacrificing their own safety , are needed to keep the city of paris safe , and this incident proves it once again . 
  i would look weird if i even saw military police ( * marechaussee * ) inside a dutch city . 
  ( apart from government building and airports ) let alone military . 
  escape to us !, 
  we do n't have a coalition at all . 
   latvia 's highest peak is 312 meters , which is 6 meters lower than our glorious 318 meters . 
  even our highest peak ** on mainland europe ** is a glorious 4 meters higher than yours !, 
  take that !, 
  surprise scenario : germany chooses a red-red-green coalition in september and we 're back at zero . 
   die linke : shared responsibility for berlin terror attacks , uncontrolled border opening wait , what ? 
  something in me says that this does not completely obey the laws of thermodynamics . 
  sweden 's redesign is too complicated . 
  just a moon and star with the ikea colour scheme would do . 
   rutte hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, 
   happened in ~ ~ slovenia ~ ~ south south-germany , right ? 
  not discovered by the germans yet . 
  the channel tunnel / eurotunnel is older than i thought . 
  i think this is an underrated comment . 
  i do n't believe in a lying press , but it 's clear that some flaws of one preferred party are omitted a little bit easier , whereas those of the party with the cordon sanitaire are outlined a bit faster . 
  especially german press . 
  i watch the main german channels pretty often . 
  sometimes i honestly wonder who 's responsible for the content selection of programs like aktuelle stunde or zdf heute . 
   2019 final netherlands - finland ? 
  nah ... that would be too much . 
  give them a break from losing . 
   with the most unattractive language in the world bro , have even heard the language of our potato-struck friends ? 
  somehow , i had actually hoped for a final against the germans . 
  too bad the danes had already kicked them out before us . 
  nothing beats beating the germans in a football match . 
  good you have n't experienced the dutch media coverage . 
  the whole week all tv outlets , news papers and internet outlets are either talking about eggs or the women 's euro 2017 . 
  literally only those two things . 
  today in the news : eggs and football . 
  tomorrow in the news : football and eggs . 
  the day past tomorrow in the news : eggs and football . 
  slovenians do n't get a hangover ... they `` have a cat '' ( imam ma\u010dka ) . 
  and when it 's a particularly bad hangover they ... `` have a tiger '' ( imam tigra ) . 
  who knew we had so much in common :p, 
  interesting difference in education . 
  the first time i heard about it was completely by accident in the second year of my bachelors and i recall having it to explain to others . 
  yes , it would have been more interesting if the question was a trade-off between affection towards national citizenship or supranational citizenship . 
  also to people who do not study or have n't studied , who comprise a significant amount of a country 's population ? 
  the president of the dutch poultry producers ' union , ** hennie de haan ** lol , my fucking sides . 
  his name is literally translated as * chicken the rooster * . 
  i thought those guys were boycotted by al their neighbours and therefore were experiencing some quite affecting national crisis ... how does that country even survive , let alone buy new navy vessels ? 
  i think 71 % is still fairly high for the netherlands . 
  when i look at page 39 of the main report and look at the number of respondents citing the erasmus exchange as the biggest achievement of the eu ( 25 % ) , i wonder what the age group of the respondents was . 
  tl ; dw , or no flash : [ summary in one picture ] ( https://twitter.com/migration_med/status/892985558682615808 ), 
  reconquista was pretty brutal .
