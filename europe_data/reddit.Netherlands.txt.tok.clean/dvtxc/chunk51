  that colour distinction between belgium and the netherlands while only differing 0.1 percent points . 
   you will hardly find official `` second-gen immigrants '' numbers because in the eyes of modern european states , all citizens are equal regardless of their background . 
  both the netherlands as well as germany keep record of second-generation immigrants , even if only one parent is foreign-born . 
  in the netherlands , these persons are called * allochtonen * ( old term ) , * personen met immigratieachtergrond * ( new politically correct term ) and in germany * personen mit migrationshintergrund * . 
  statistical offices keep track of the numbers in separate categories . 
   if she had shot her attacker with an illegal gun , she 'd be charged for possession of the illegal gun anyway . 
  owners of a jewelry shop once killed a burglar with an illegally possessed firearm in the netherlands , yet no charge followed on this case . 
  the case was closed on the grounds of * self defense * and this outweighed the killing of one of the burglar , even despite illegal arms possession . 
  - ^ ^ now ^ ^ i ^ ^ know ^ ^ i ^ ^ can ^ ^ use ^ ^ this ^ ^ saying ^ ^ in ^ ^ german ^ ^ as ^ ^ well ^ ^ without ^ ^ sounding ^ ^ embarrassing . 
  do n't do it . 
  it 's a trap . 
  this should be answered appropriately : ** french fries over flemish fries !!!, 
  it must be some belgian pyromaniac taking revenge on us for antwerp . 
  still , i think the latinised version should be spas\u00edbo , ja v p\u00f3lnom pory\u00e1dke . 
  to indicate the stresses . 
  now , i just do n't know how to combine \u00e1 with \u00e4 . 
  i still do n't consider this nor the original cyrillic alphabet of russian to be civilised as long as they do n't use something to indicate the stressed syllable or just replace the o with an a in other syllables . 
  syllable stress fucks up pronunciation and orthography in russian . 
  one could use accent marks to indicate the stress . 
  * spas\u00edbo ( to know that the last o is actually an a ) * seg\u00f3dn\u00e4 / sew\u00f3dn\u00e4 ( how are we going to solve this ? ), 
  but ... nothing beats our spelling of words like ** fietsbandventieldopjesfabrieksdirecteur ** or the mighty german ** rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz ** !!, 
  now , eat that . 
  * calais immigrant chaos * brexit * plummeting fertility rates * this news well fuck ... 
  ricocheting rounds , caught in crossfire , or just collateral damage because he put the weapon into automatic mode without having any experience . 
  sure , you wo n't accomplish anything with stricter gun laws in the eu , when the arms are sold in bosnia , serbia or heck , even outside the european continent . 
  the only thing that will stop these guns then , are stricter border controls . 
  when a language lacks compound nouns ... 
  those were the days ... 
   less trivial once someone finds gas underneath it . 
  there is . 
  a lot , that area is known for the biggest gas reserves of europe . 
  currently all exploited by a dutch semi-public company though . 
  please , call it * bodensee * . 
  i get confused everytime i read * lake of constanze * . 
  it makes me think you 're talking about a place in italy somehow . 
  germany 's approach on this issue : \u00af \\ \\ ( \u30c4 ) / \u00af i like tom 's videos , but he is n't wearing a red shirt in this one . 
  i think he should redo this video !, 
   but tell us the rest of the story . 
  did the professor survive ? 
  i have no idea how it ended and to keep the discussion in this thread a bit on-topic i will stick to just a link to one exemplary post : ** fb not permitted . 
  look for it yourself : astaunirostock/posts/1373774239354064 * the fact that they refuse to mention specific excerpts or clarify accusations is kinda cringy to me . 
  but anyways to come back to my actual point , to see students ' committees being so involved in these kind of topics and even specific texts of certain professors was weird to see for me . 
  maybe i do not understand the role of asta 's in germany , but similar councils in the netherlands are much more organisatoric related . 
  these themes are perhaps brought into discussion by non-official student associations , but not representative student committees , which speak on behalf of all the students . 
  there are plenty of discussions on social issues organised at or near the campuses over here . 
  but i can not recall any of them being brought into attention via the official channels . 
  let alone taking those instances the role of opinion formers . 
   and it is not even clear why that restaurant failed , it is entirely possible that people did n't want to have lunch next to 35 neo nazis and so overtime the normal people simply stayed away . 
  i do n't think it helps , if some start to vandalise your restaurant to indicate that people should stay away from it . 
  if , for example , the owner has allowed these meetings on certain days during which the group had reserved the restaurant in its entirety , other guests would not have noticed anything from these meetings in the first place . 
  then it gets about time to include the dutch overseas territories on this map . 
  i actually fear that this behaviour is accepted in germany . 
  i have seen public shaming of professors on german universities in facebook student groups ( e.g. 
  asta , allgemeiner studentenausschuss pages ) just because of a word lapse , that might have been considered to be sexist or discriminatory . 
  you 'd be laughed at , if you tried to set up these witch hunts in the netherlands , yet the political correctness in germany pushes the * open for everyone , except those with a different opinion * a bit too much . 
  when i first read the title , i thought russia once again reconquered suomenlinna . 
   i 'm beginning to think that war might have been a poor idea . 
  it made rotterdam well accessible by car . 
  legend is incomplete * light blue : to be reclaimed * light yellow : to be annexed, 
  ** shakes fist *, 
  it will follow germany 's curve . 
  we have a quite similar style of economy : suppressed wages in an economy with an enormous trade surpluss . 
  it might even be lower , as the median purchasing power in the netherlands seems to be lagging behind germany 's one . 
  i love this randomness, 
  i live in germany . 
  perception of a language is of course always relative . 
  and definitely not all dialects have it , but it sounded to me like this around hannover and eastwards . 
   but what if our intelligent buildings and machines one day gain consciousness ? 
  what if they then produce smog in order to survive ? 
  you just went full [ hexxus ] ( https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/5/57/demonic_hexxus.jpg ) from [ ferngully ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferngully:_the_last_rainforest ), 
  maybe the dutch are more nationalist than other nations think we are . 
   dak van brabant , used to be a garbage dump , now 60m high . 
  til finally got something to make fun of brabant . 
  well , we would n't massively terrorise your roads with slow-driving cars with caravans instead , if we were able to build them . 
   arabic is the real throat ~ ~ killer ~ ~ slicer / s, 
  ehm . . we have never built artificial mountains and volcanoes though . 
  damn . 
  that polandball was pretty dark . 
  or antilliaans, 
  you are just included in ( old ) - norwegian . 
   speaking german is done with consumption and conviction , one nearly has the tendency to salute with it . 
  i never perceived german as such . 
  the ch sounds are much softer and closer to those in flemish . 
  though their syllables seem to be stuffed with s - and sh - like sounds . 
  to me , most of the ` standard german ' dialect sounds like the people have got braces in . 
  it gets less if you go south . 
  in that case , we can double the amount of norwegian speakers as well , if the danish were willing to get that potato out of their mouth . 
  well , afrikaans is considered to be a daughter language rather than a separate branch according to some classifications . 
  i think that the mutual understanding is bigger with afrikaans than with west flemish , for example , which has been included in dutch on this map . 
  haha , let 's try , the next time i go to carnival in k\u00f6ln i will just stick to dutch . 
  why would one be bothered to learn dutch and voluntarily hurt their throat though ? 
  for a more structured grammar , go east . 
  for the language we almost speak as natives , go west . 
  ** edit : ** damn , i hit dutch national pride . 
  do n't kill me plox . 
  one could argue to include afrikaans in the total number of dutch speakers , which would add another 5 million . 
  at least for me , afrikaans is perfectly understandable and readable . 
  wait what , a german using sarcasm ??? 
  ** confused * - ^ ^ sorry , ^ ^ based ^ ^ on ^ ^ personal ^ ^ experience : ^ ^ a ^ ^ german ^ ^ girlfriend ^ ^ of ^ ^ mine ^ ^ asks ^ ^ me ^ ^ to ^ ^ use ^ ^ sarcasm ^ ^ signs , ^ ^ otherwise ^ ^ she ^ ^ misses ^ ^ the ^ ^ jokus . 
   you dutch guys are ** too ** educated for that .
