  haha , love it : every time a german show does something in the netherlands , the reporter just speaks in german . 
  because , fuck us , we are supposed to speak german , right ? 
  i should try to speak to a random person in germany in dutch . 
  i bet i would get the response : `` wasss ?? '', 
  so far , everything is going according to plan . 
  our southern neighbours are unaware of the operation . 
  no , it 's just as the netherlands : it looks scenic , but the new technology is actually there . 
  the engine is probably electric and equipped with a tesla supercharger system .

  we actually do : [ the recently opened stretch of the a4 ] ( http://www.regio15.nl/images/2015/12/18/a4schiedam/w-img_2409.jpg ) lies completely below terrain level just to reduce the visual and noise impact on the surroundings , yet being a cheaper solution than a full-scale tunnel .

  the * ridderzaal * is used for an annual meeting of the * staten-generaal * ( including both the house of representatives and the dutch senate ) , during which the king holds his speech from the throne . 
  the speech is held on the third tuesday of september . 
  why did this need 3 separate maps ? 
   i believe 1 in 5 births in denmark are to foreign mothers . 
  he mentioned that 1 out of 4 has german ancestry , in other words : 3 out of 4 births are to foreign mothers . 
  i know it 's frankfurt , whose numbers will be averaged out by east german l\u00e4nder ... yet it wo n't surprise me if the average is already higher than denmark 's . 
  more on this in [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/df9v8pomuxg?t=220 ) calculations are done according to the oecd statistics database .

  anyways , i expected germany 's youth population to cross the rubicon around 2025-2030 instead of 2020 . 
  one fact remains , despite some misinterpretations in this video : the demographical transition seems to be imminent .

  yeah , those number seem to indicate ** gross mean wages ** . 
  [ gross median wage in 2016 was about $ 36.500 ] ( https://www.cpb.nl/publicatie/macro-economische-verkenning-mev-2017 ) , which is significantly less than that number , and as you said , still does not include taxes . 
  yes , overtime seems to be something usual in the netherlands .

  the transition to renewables is a slow process . 
  especially if you consider how much faster the increase in oil consumption has been in the sixties and seventies . 
  i am still in support of nuclear energy , if accompanied by further development of new renewables . 
  nuclear energy has such a great potential , as single plants deliver so much more than vast areas of wind turbines or contemporary solar panels can do . 
  we could use nuclear energy to at least reduce emissions much faster . 
  in the meanwhile , we could further develop efficiency of solar energy , which at the moment is just still insufficient for continent-wide energy production . 
  germany is trying really hard , which is already reflected in their absurd energy price which tops the european energy prices . 
  they just manage to break even on good days for consumer consumption and we have not even started the electric car transition yet . 
  [ on the dutch subreddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/6jrpxq/wat_een_malle_vertoning_die_menselijke_keten_naar/ ) , there were some good examples of how the current media narrative has demonised nuclear energy in the recent example of the belgian nuclear reactor tihange . 
  despite having some unique safety features which are n't normally found in other nuclear reactors , the current narrative repeats falsely interpreted safety inspection reports about the presumed danger of this nuclear power plant . 
  i doubt whether [ the people in the 90 km-long chain ] ( https://www.chain-reaction-tihange.eu/en/ ) are actually aware of how safety inspections are carried out . 
  on a sidenote . 
  if we would like to contribute to good governance as well , governments should take the initiative to build thorium reactors instead of uranium reactors . 
  the latter has been chosen out of political motivation , since ... well the obvious reasons during the sixties . 
  we could greatly reduce the waste production with thorium reactors , whose waste products have much shorter half life . 
  i agree . 
  where can i sign the petition ? 
  i heard there is some nice * levensruimte * in the ardennes .

  the final exam of primary education is just multiplechoice . 
  exams on computers in higher education are getting more accepted as well . 
  as a matter of fact , i had an exam on a computer a few months ago as well . 
  they are slowly turning into ipad-schools over here , where they do all their work on tablets . 
   bild further reported that another ** female * police officer danced on a table outside wearing nothing but a bathrobe with ~ ~ his ~ ~ ** her * weapon hanging from ~ ~ his ~ ~ ** her * shoulder . 
  - how 's the introduction of the body cams going in germany ? 
  and that 's why i stated ` unconditional ' in boldface . 
  as an example , inhabitants of rotterdam only get welfare if they 're actively looking for a job in the meanwhile , or instead accept temporary offers from the municipality which is something similar to community service . 
  if you do not comply with these requirements , your welfare will be lowered to an amount that 's actually insufficient to independently live from . 
  only those who are disabled , get exempted from this , which in my opinion is fair system . 
  - amsterdam ^ ^ \\ ( like ^ ^ berlin , ^ ^ the ^ ^ joke ^ ^ of ^ ^ our ^ ^ country ) tries it the other way around : they give unconditional welfare to those who do n't work . 
  rotterdam drastically decreased long-term unemployment after the introduction of this measure , and decreased municipality expenses as well . 
  amsterdam , on the other hand , has an ever growing number of people who are long-term unemployed . 
  i do n't get reddit 's obsession with ubi . 
  when i heard about it for the first time , just one year ago , i though it it 's the most ridiculous thing one could come up with . 
  and i 'm still not convinced of this idiocy . 
  ** if ** , a country manages to afford it ( which all countries do n't ) , then this somehow must end in a ridiculous inflation . 
  an increase of the ubi with just a few euros must disturb the entire economy . 
  and furthermore , i just do n't want to live in a country in which i know that people get ** unconditional ** money from my taxes . 
  as soon as ubi will be introduced in the netherlands , i 'm gone . 
  find yourself someone else who 's willing to fund this project . 
  a country full of artists and people who work ` when they feel like it ' just does n't run .
