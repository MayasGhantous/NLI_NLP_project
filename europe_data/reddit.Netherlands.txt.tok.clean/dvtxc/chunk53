  should be turned into a comic . 
   hello guy lol . 
  austrians and germans here are going to be triggered because of to the lack of academic titles and addressing formalities in the opening of this mail . 
   never heard of it . 
  i think he meant * zuid-nederland * . 
  well , i do n't see any rindviecher or t\u00f8rrfisk on the picture . 
  seriously , i do n't know any dutch person with a merc , let alone with an s class . 
  except perhaps some grannies driving the old a class line , which was ugly as hell , before they renewed that line . 
  however , the turks i know , all drive a mercedes . 
  and love to honk a lot . 
  no , those are mocros . 
  mocros drive audi and bmw . 
  turks drive mercs , with carpets on the back seat . 
  huh , turks are the ones who drive a s class over here . 
   you want to prosecute an individual politician for an international legal framework ( the 1951 refugee convention ) that has been in place for decades ? 
  actually , the 1951 refugee convention is the biggest problem the european union will be facing in the coming years . 
  it does not work , * because of the very fact it has been in place for decades * . 
  the possible amount of migrants heading towards europe is nowhere near the amount of refugees in the fifties . 
  furthermore , it has been proven that refugee camps on african territory and a migrant deal according to the turkish model would be a juridically sound construction , in compliance with the international legal framework . 
  the fact that klaver , for example , bailed out from this proposal had nothing to do with the legal implications of such a deal , but rather with his desires . 
  however , my view that the current refugee convention is outdated , still holds . 
  during the fifties , it was easy to keep track of the refugees , as schengen did not exist . 
  if one applied for asylum in , say france , it was guaranteed that he would stay in france , unless given permission to travel further . 
  during the fifties , we did not see a massive migrant influx consisting of primarily young men , coming from a completely different culture , literally spanning the bridge between the third and first world . 
  during the fifties , we did not see an influx of primarily economic migrants , who are furthermore willing to dodge age and background checks . 
  during the fifties , we did not have such a discrepancy between fertility rate of migrant and host populations . 
  the 1951 refugee convention is an analogous legal framework that has an increasing lack of compatibility with the contemporary world . 
  i do n't know where you 'd like to position the _ volkskrant _ instead , but i would certainly not position it anywhere right of the centre . 
  the only newspapers that cross that line are _ algemeen dagblad _ , _ het financi\u00eble dagblad _ and _ telegraaf _ . 
  for me , as well as according to various other sources , the volkskrant remains a newspaper on the left side of the political spectrum . 
  one of the few newspapers that did drastically change their position , was _ nrc handelsblad _ , which went from centre-right to overtaking the volkskrant on the left-hand side after they were bought by the belgian news corporation ( de persgroep ) and installed a new editor-in-chief ( peter vandermeersch ) . 
  from all adjectives , i would n't use * cosy * to describe rotterdam . 
  rather brutalist , modern , chilly and perhaps vibrant . 
  though , having a capital as a beta city gives me the urge to paste the kopiernudeln of berlin here ... :p, 
  the netherlands was poor compared to belgium before our golden age . 
  look what we made out of it . 
  dutch war correspondent/reporter arnold karskens has been in the news before for his plans to start prosecuting ngos for their deadly pull factor in the mediterranean sea . 
  however , only this week , it has been announced that a legal procedure is officially started . 
  this legal procedure is unique , as it does not only include prosecutors from europe , but also african relatives from migrants in a joint effort to stop the mass influx across the mediterranean . 
  this article was published in a major dutch newspaper : [ volkskrant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_volkskrant ) ( circulation 250 000 nationwide , 3rd largest , usually regarded as centre-left ) - i have translated the relevant section manually :  in order to put an end to the deadly chaos on the southern border of europe , i , as chairman of the `` onderzoek oorlogsmisdaden '' ^ ^ * foundation , on behalf of the relatives of the drowned migrants from mali , have started a legal procedure on april 21st , by informing the public prosecutor , against frans timmermans ( first vp of the european commission ) and against dutch ngos ( such as msf ) , accusing them of [ culpable homicide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culpable_homicide ) according to article 307 of the dutch criminal code , and of assisting and facilitating human trafficking according to article 197 of the dutch criminal code . 
  last week , the prosecution counsel of international affairs stated that the case was being pending . 
  and rightly so . 
  with their approach , frans timmermans and dutch ngos accepted the risk of migrants taking the mediterranean route and turning it into the largest cemetery in europe . 
  ^ ^ ** arnold ** ^ ^ ** karskens ** ^ ^ was ^ ^ a ^ ^ journalist/reporter ^ ^ during ^ ^ the ^ ^ erp ^ ^ militant ^ ^ actions ^ ^ in ^ ^ el ^ ^ salvador , ^ ^ bosnian ^ ^ war ^ ^ and ^ ^ iraq ^ ^ war . 
  -- - the entire article by google translate :  # eu is guilty of drowning migrants   and ngos like msf also promote risky crossings   european migration policy and non-governmental ngos promote people 's risk of crossing africa to europe and are therefore guilty of the drowning deaths of many of them . 
    the drowning of migrants in the mediterranean is the biggest humanitarian disaster at the border of the european union since the yugoslav civil war in the 1990s . 
  i point out two big guilty in this tragedy . 
    the first is called frans timmermans . 
  as the first vice-president of the european commission , he is co-responsible for determining and implementing european migration policy . 
  it goes without saying that any migrant can apply for asylum in the european union and , rarely , after leaving rejection . 
  the result is an invigorating effect which has estimated that 14,750 migrants ( source : missing migrants ) have drowned in the mediterranean during the last 3.5 years , broadly leaving libya . 
    despite alternatives , timmermans attaches to this catastrophic policy . 
  until 2013 australia had similar drowning dramas . 
  now , the policy `` no way '' prevents an illegal migrant from ever getting a residence permit and hardly any people die . 
  anyone who nevertheless tries to conquer this policy risks to end up with about 2,000 refugees and asylum seekers in camps on the islands of manus and nauru . 
  maybe not very pleasant , but humaner than timmermans opening politics , because only 2017 nearly drowned the same number of people at the eu threshold . 
    the australian approach also works better than the turkey deal , such as the european union , which concluded in 2016 . 
  however , in 2017 , some 8,000 people have already been on the boat to greece . 
  in addition , the european union is dependent on the grilling of president recep tayyip erdogan . 
  when he opens the locks and swells the flow , repeat the disasters of 2015 and 2016 with about 1,240 deaths . 
    timmermans now wants to make the same turkey deal with african countries , but who will hold migrants back on the long african borders and coastlines ? 
  he himself sees a task of rolling up gangs of ` unscrupulous smugglers ' who benefit from ` desperate people ' , as he wrote in the volkskrant of june 15 . 
  but that image goes beyond the pure logistical role that smuggling gangs play and denies its own responsibility . 
  after all , the offer ( access to meat pots ) determines the demand ( because no migrants do not have smuggling gangs ) . 
    in addition , what migrants are we talking about ? 
  even groenlinks foreman jesse klaver identifies 90 percent as an economic refugee . 
  and considering the true victims of war : with the cost of one refugee in europe , the european union can easily maintain the ten or twenty-fold population overseas , thus including the elderly , widows or poor people who have no money or enjoy good health for the dangerous travel to europe . 
    the second guilty of the massive drownings in the mediterranean are non-governmental organizations like msfs who pick up migrants with their lifeboats . 
  since the arrival of these ` aid organizations ' in 2014 , the number of drownings has risen to around 4,500 by 2016 . 
  instead of seaworthy ships , migrants are taking rubber boats . 
    of course , ngos save people , but the pull factor attracts a lot of migrants because , as the european frontier and coast guard agency ( frontex ) believes , the migrants `` trust '' the humanitarian aid they receive at sea . 
  instead of warning for the dangers and protecting them from supremacy , ngo 's migrants only help after they have first locked the minefield . 
    in order to put an end to the deadly villages at the european southern border , i , as chairman of the research crime investigation foundation , reported on behalf of dozens of relatives of drowned migrants from mali to the public prosecutor 's office against frans timmermans for `` death due to debt ' , article 307 criminal code , and against dutch ngos , as msf , additionally , human crime assistance , article 197 wvs . 
  the national parlia - ment told last week that the case was being pending . 
  rightly so . 
  by their approach , french timmermans and dutch ngos , or rescue ships flying the flag of the netherlands , accept the risk of migrants taking the mediterranean to become the largest cemetery in europe . 
  to be honest , it looks terrible . 
  that black block looks so misplaced . 
  there must be a better way of combining the colours . 
   renamed as the kingdom of benelux lol . 
  tourists still calling their destination ` holland ' anyways would be the ultimate trigger . 
  besides . 
  how does this even work ? 
  benelux edition ? 
  what are we going to do with the duke of luxembourg ? 
  uhm op : are you sure about the gdp of liechtenstein ? 
  shhhtt . . 
  if you look away for a sec , they will unnoticedly take pommern and schlesien back . 
  benelux should unite . 
  honestly , the combined gdp and a further growth due to integration benefits ^ ^ ^ \\ ( ^ ^ ^ read ^ ^ ^ as : ^ ^ ^ stop ^ ^ ^ obstructing ^ ^ ^ antwerp ^ ^ ^  ^ ^ ^ ) could break the hegemony of the french-german axis in the eu and make a good replacement for the uk . 
  just think about the potential gdp gain if we sanitised belgian bureaucracy . 
  - ^ ^ after ^ ^ all , ^ ^ belgian ^ ^ independence ^ ^ was ^ ^ a ^ ^ british ^ ^ conspiracy !!!, 
  send help . 
  they do n't have affordable unlimited 4g in germany . 
  just to think that even this hill is for three quarters located on german and belgian clay . 
  how to trigger r/europe, 
  gold ? 
  of course you have . 
  if we manage to bridge the gap , we close sweden 's and denmark 's direct access to the atlantic ocean . 
  the norwegian wet dream to finally take revenge on those pesky swedes and danes .
