  how are we going to solve the problem with the norwegian trench ? 
  if we polder that , it 's going to be a massive hole . 
  that border extent of germany ... 
  ** looks at flair * ah , you guys really made [ mimicking a ostrich ] ( http://wonderopolis.org/wp-content/uploads//2015/03/1425_3.jpg ) into a sport huh ? 
  i always get the impression , there is a distinct division between the perception in the netherlands and within the enclave of amsterdam . 
  that bike line literally has a bicycle traffic jam in the morning . 
  same here : _ paraplu _ and _ parasol _ . 
  i 've heard ost-friesland and northern niedersachsen is relatively sparsely populated and within reach ... 
  so , according to this logic , the netherlands is a ticking time bomb ? 
  well , i 'm not german myself , but as far as i know , the npd can safely be classified as ` quite extreme ' . 
  they somehow managed to get some seats in mv though . 
  how about natural growth excluding immigration ? 
  i 'm sure our reformists in the bible belt will bring us victory . 
  that took me some time . 
  so , what will italy do with * koper * then ? 
  leave that tiny interruption of the coastline ? 
  missing the access to the sea ? 
   west-flanders there is a reason why [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj0g6bh0iqy ) exists . 
  they use the standard dutch diminutives in writing , like * - tje * , * - je * and * - kje * , even though their spoken diminutives differ . 
  their writing has been standardised very much to standard dutch , even though some regional dialects have grammatical differences . 
  as an example : some flemish spoken dialects clearly distinct between feminine and masculine nouns , although the standardised dutch writing barely distinguishes these two genders . 
  ah i just thought all bavarian diminutives were something like * - ln * , * - le * , or * - rl * . 
  maybe i was confused with schw\u00e4bisch, 
   ( headline : `` bergen has had rain every day this june '' ) i do not see how this is different from the normal weather in bergen . 
  the flemish/belgian dutch diminutive suffix is even closer to the german one : * zwembadske * though it is not allowed in written language . 
  ( their spelling and grammar rules are the same to ours ) a bit like your * schwimmb\u00e4dln * , if i 'm not mistaken . 
   overmorrow spotted the dutch speaker . 
  `` the day after tomorrow '' , 
  wc football ? 
  what 's that ? 
  i am against further integration and therefore i am even more opposed to a unitary state . 
  i favour a more eec-level of cooperation ( pre-maastricht ) or a rigorous reform of the eu including partition of the eurozone . 
  in the latter case , i would still like to reduce the influence of the ec somehow . 
  the dutch flag reminds me somehow of the confederate stainless banner . 
   * netherlands higher than finland hahaha , suck i. ... wait , i 'm anti-federalist ... ** confused * : /, 
  minimalism went overboard, 
  the point is , half of our country has unstable soil and has the tendency to sink . 
   but then again , when you 're a flat country , building is much much cheaper , quicker and easier to do/maintain . 
  it 's to be expected . 
  actually our roads are crazily expensive for a flat country , as they need anchored foundation in the western provinces to prevent sinking and displacement due to the unstable soil . 
  albeit glamousless , good infrastructure supports the economy . 
  it shows that we praise the things that make us more efficient . 
  usually , wine achieves the opposite . 
  to be honest , some border crossings to germany start to look like the border crossings to belgium . 
  some highways indeed seem to be in a bad condition , if i am allowed to say that with respect to the kind of highways i am used to here in the netherlands . 
  noisy tarmac , stripes to quickly seal the asphalt , and so on . 
  by the way , if you decide to rebuild some stretches , could you elongate the entry acceleration lanes as well ? 
  those are terribly short in germany . 
  0 . o first you have to sharply turn on to the lane , keeping below 50 to prevent spinning out , then you have to floor it , hoping your car can reach anywhere above 100 in time . 
  can somebody explain me this * scharze null * - policy ? 
  ** cough *, 
  what a peasant country . 
  you ai n't complete if you do n't speak 5 languages . 
  ** end brag mode * by the way , i think a lot of the respondents in the netherlands answered the number of languages they learned at school , instead of the number of languages they actually speak . 
  although it may be true for the older generation , the younger generation primarily uses english for all foreign contact . 
  username checks out, 
  * these results come from the ** general / parliamentary elections ** and not from the presidential elections . 
  * french results are based on the second round * blank and null ballots have been included in ` others ' . 
  * percentages calculation based on actual number of votes , rounded to one decimal . 
  = percentpoints * source = general election pages from wikipedia ( english version ),

  our mark . 
  they voted in favour of a bill that makes the hacking of electronic implants legally possible . 
  screw us if it ever comes to brain-computer interfaces . 
  all i can mention now is bohemia interactive , but , they create some really nice virtual environments though ... 
  that snap election was unprecedented as well . 
  only two countries ( in this research ) though ...

   you mean `` dump them in libya where the children get to be used as unpaid labour and their human rights are violated while we look the other way '' those who would have to right to apply for asylum in europe would have been able to come to europe . 
  those who do not , should not have come to libya / the mediterranean in the first place . 
  and i have heard completely different stories about the turkey deal . 
  they seem to have a better deal over there , than if they would have been in an asylum centre over here . 
  i am getting a little bit tired of this hysteria about the refugee treaty . 
  first of all , the other parties : vvd/cda/d66 have agreed on a deal that was juridically sound , in compliance with the treaties and would respect the basic human rights . 
  furthermore , i want to point at out that the agreement on refugees comes from the fifties . 
  a time during which schengen did not even exist , so it was easy to keep track of those who would be accepted in a country . 
  it was a time in which european countries were not introduced to a massive amount of freeloading lying asylum seekers , but mostly genuine refugees , fleeing a war elsewhere . 
  i find it pathetic that some institutions try to warn voters over human right infringements , while actually mentioning completely sane measures . 
  the university of leiden published a list of these measures , which were meant the scare off voters . 
  on the contrary , after reading this list , i have only become more convinced to vote for them . 
   not to mention that groenlinks would have been decimated in the next election if they took this atrocious deal . 
  no , this very rejection will actually decimate them . 
  groenlinks showed its true face during the coalition talks . 
  i already presumed that groenlinks would take a far-fetched stance on immigration , but now they have proven to be insane . 
  i think it will hurt them in the polls and when the hype around klaver is over , they will be left with their core voters , which at max will give them around 5 seats . 
  and rightfully so . 
  oh dear ... what if the mariana trench comes next ?

  underrated comment . 
  it basically means they just want european companies to make the encryption , since apple , google and microsoft dominate the market of electronic communication . 
  [ germany is considering is `` source telecom surveillance '' , where authorities install software on phones to relay messages before they are encrypted . 
  that is now illegal .

  i work in matlab very often . 
  matlab does not support arrays starting at zero .
