  working laws should be abidden . 
   as little as possible , especially when the weather is nice . 
  my instinct does n't compute this . 
  - must ** werk ** . 
  why should i use spaces ? 
  i always use tabs ... 
  that 's why i mentioned the netherlands twice . 
  i just typed in some pseudocode in a textbox in photoshop . 
  the actual code , which i also used in the dutch general election megathread , is way less clear and written in matlab/python instead . 
  first 9999 characters : ( pastebin is not allowed on r/europe ), 
  a german composition , recorded in the netherlands , put on track in france , made by a dutch company . 
  ** european pride intensifies *, 
  we are coming for ye !, 
   teach us how to achieve this !, 
  1 . make sure the parties hate each other enough , so they never want to be in the same government . 
  2 . introduce some exceptions with complex love triangles , so at least there is an illusion that there might be a possibility . 
  repeat coalition talks ad infinitum . 
  i see no temple of zeus on top of the mountain . 
  it must be fake . 
  nah , i think that climate would make us a lot less productive and , besides , we would have to wait much much much longer on the next [ elfstedentocht ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elfstedentocht ) . 
  but ... d\u00f6ner kebab !!! eleven !!, 
   reconquistaed ... the spanish netherlands ? 
  i see what u did there . 
  but at least , we have driven off the walloons , so i guess that counts as a compensation . 
  it will usually be designated by `` flat ins festnetz / in alle handynetze '', 
  yes yes , it will be bergen-aan-zee . 
  because ... hon hon hon language . 
  amsterdam : 10m2 student room with shared kitchen , bathroom $ 800 random university city in the netherlands : $ 500 random university city in germany ( except perhaps hamburg and berlin ) : 10m2 for just $ 200 - $ 300, 
   also germany only allows for dual citizenship for eu members . 
  what if you already have both eu and non-eu citizenship ? 
  given you can find affordable housing in those countries . 
  germany has way cheaper housing than all those aforementioned countries . 
  it has been for a long time in the netherlands . 
  they attempt to achieve a come back . 
  not sure whether because primarily reformed parts of the netherlands flooded and catholic south stayed dry , or because the weed capital of europe got flooded . 
  actually i did n't , but i used a linear burn blending mode for the labels , which did n't work out really well for malta , since it performs the blending operation on a mostly white background , which renders white in turn again . 
  to be honest , * leefgebied * might actually be a better / colloquial translation , but we use the literal translation if we want to make the reference to germany in a joke clear . 
   but imagine the border gore , if we solely annexed hesse !, 
  we already had such a weird exclave when luxembourg remained in a dutch union for about 60 years after belgium succeeded . 
  no , because the fair use policy stipulates that one is not allowed to roam for more than 4 months in another country , when it is evident that the person seems to use it more abroad than at the provider 's country . 
  yes yes . 
   some nrw would give that nice industry gdp , and some rp would give some nice * levensruimte * with hills we could escape to in case of flooding . 
  because data plans meant for internet access on a tablet and a laptop belong to a different market . 
  http://dfmonitor.eu/prices/country/ by switching on `` show mobile broadband '' you can compare data-only plans . 
  oh , i would n't mind some eastwards expansion ... / s, 
  attempt at sarcasm fell flat on its face . 
  yes you did . 
  no use denying . 
  admit your fdp membership . 
  give us a few months . 
  the reason it is so low in the netherlands is because we have been introduced to unlimited lte data plans only a few months ago . 
  many still do n't even believe it . 
  but once we get used to watch the kinky stuff in 4k on our mobiles ... ... we will catch up . 
   and it 's not like gl is such an extremist here . 
  they are perfectly willing to compromise on economical migration , the problem point where they do n't want to compromise on are refugees which i completely agree with . 
  they want to sort those refugees ** on european/dutch soil ** , which is exactly the very reason that both economical and political refugees manage to acquire a home in europe , at the cost of extra deaths on the mediterranean . 
  as soon as they are here , the economical refugees get below the radar and are free to roam around . 
  if they really wanted to compromise on economical migration , they would have accepted an turkey-like deal or an australian-like solution . 
  but it is not their goal . 
  the more there pour in , the happier klaver is . 
  lol , it 's a swedish operator ( tele-2 ) that broke up the market over here and offers unlimited everything at lte for just $ 25 . 
   i 'll fill up 1 gig in 20min masturbating in the middle of forests and vargam\u00e4e swamps for 20mins watching 4k porn while a goose walks behind me and dickslaps me . 
  i do n't even ... 
  http://dfmonitor.eu/prices/operator/ according to the source , it should be available at 3-at . 
  [ maybe you will find something in this dutch megathread ] ( https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/1582154/142 ) with the help of google translate . 
  ( 3572 comments , so it 's huge , but all dedicated to experiences with tele2 ), 
  there are only 3 operators in germany , after o2 and e-plus decided to merge into one . 
  we had ridiculous prices in the netherlands as well , until a fourth swedish operator ( tele-2 ) joined . 
  they only deployed a lte-network and roamed 2g/3g from other networks . 
  as a result : they have brought the other operators on their knees and now suddenly prices drop harder than the depreciation of brand-new cars . 
   green pragmatists i do n't think you understand the word * pragmatic * , as their pertinacity is far from pragmatic . 
   but for none of them are green policies the highest priority . 
  might be the animal 's party , but they are too fundamentalist in my opinion . 
  literally everything is caused by global warming or human cruelty according to them . 
  and the entire migration flux from africa is our fault as well ... / s, 
  they only have their own lte-network which saves a lot of costs , as they only need to maintain 4g cell towers . 
  they roam on other networks for umts and gprs . 
  the speed is pretty decent and seem to have very good coverage as well . 
  t-mobile has one of the fastest 4g networks according to the tests and provides unlimited 4g for $ 30 / $ 35 as well . 
  ( you get $ 5 discount if you sign up a friend for their plan as well . ), 
   i still wait for umts in our valley damn ... 
  i thought das tal der ahnungslosen had become something of the past . 
  it has long been since a reddit comment made me laugh so hard !, 
  map includes only plans that offer at least 3 mbit/s and at least 1000 call minutes . 
  does it satisfy those requirements as well ? 
  oh my god . 
  might as well be the same in dutch !!! eleven !! . 
  maand ( month ) / maan ( moon ) i might be on to something . 
  it must be the orbit period of the moon ? 
  according to the fair use policy , you are only allowed to use this up to 4 months . 
  if they notice you are systematically using more data abroad than in the provider 's company , they remain the right to disconnect you or charge extra for roaming . 
  why the heck did you actually merge o2 and e-plus ? 
  there are a lot of parties that already incorporate green policies . 
  they literally come in every flavour : * left-wing green : groenlinks * centrist green : d66 * christian green : cu * fundamentalist green : animal 's party * labour party has been pushing for electric cars and is known for its prioritisation of public transport * economic liberals / vvd : are slowly undergoing a change towards green policies as well . 
  during party congresses it has been coined that the party should proliferate itself more as the green party on the right . 
  * right-wing green : even the fvd has incorporated plans to support key transitions to a sustainable energy supply, 
  the real question is , do we beat finland ? 
  how unlimited is their ` unlimited ' ? 
   i do n't like at all what they have in mind for reforms concerning the democratic representation in the netherlands , they want to adopt something more like an american system that 's something they wanted when they started . 
  ( sixties and seventies ) i do not think they still pursue these reforms , especially since it would not benefit them at all .
