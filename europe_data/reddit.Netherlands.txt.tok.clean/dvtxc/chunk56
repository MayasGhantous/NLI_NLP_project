  they would only win constituencies like amsterdam and leiden , etc. . and would be marginalised to the size of the libdems in the uk . 
  i would never vote for them , as it was already long clear to me that the name linksgroen would suit them better than groenlinks . 
  there 's actually relatively speaking little ` green ' about them , if you put it in perspective how much other parties have evolved in the mean time by including green policies ( perhaps except cda on the far end ) . 
  more parties are realising that renewables will become necessary sooner or later . 
  a push for electric cars was initialised by the pvda , instead of groenlinks . 
  the stress is rather on ( far ) left-wing policies and on open borders . 
  the polls show little to no change for the pvv : http://www.ipsos-nederland.nl/ipsos-politieke-barometer/barometer-van-deze-week, 
  decisive win on the fins, 
  as far as i know , we usually do n't hold new elections . 
  but there is a real chance that this possibility will be discussed by the house of representatives . 
  if we get new elections , it would be unique . 
  ** 20:34 ** the second official attempt to form a coalition has failed . 
  after the first attempt , the four parties ( vvd/cda/gl / d66 ) have tried to restart coalition talks . 
  the parties could not agree upon the number of refugees to take in . 
  groenlinks ( gl ) wanted a hard minimum on the number of refugees that the netherlands would have to take in on an yearly basis . 
  the only other combination ( vvd/cda/d66 / cu ) has been ruled out as the d66 has said it will refuse any talks with the cu on the formation of a coalition . 
  a cooperation with the cu would be quite problematic with the d66 , as they have very differing stances on drugs and euthanasia legalisation . 
  furthermore , the previous coalition has gained experience with parliament members who suddenly left the party . 
  these members remain the right to keep their seat and , thus continue as an independent member of parliament . 
  vvd-d66-cda-cu would comprise a total of 76 / 150 seats , so they can not afford someone suddenly leaving the coalition . 
  it is a very very thin majority and with the experiences of the previous coalition in mind , this thin majority scares the coalition parties . 
  all possibilities have been ruled out now . 
  ** extra update ** vvd/cda/d66 wanted a formal agreement between the eu and north-african countries similar to the eu-turkey agreement regarding the regulation of immigration . 
  gl has rejected the proposal to work towards such formal agreement , unless 25 000 asylum seekers would be formally accepted annually on top of the regular annual asylum intake . 
  vvd/cda/d66 did not want to formalise this minimum .

  in fact , groningen is the poorest province of the netherlands and holds several communist strongholds in some municipalities in that province . 
  i guess they incorporated the value of the gas reserves , even though those reserves belong to the state and not to the inhabitants of the province .

  they got the news about the blockade of the route . 
  if i am allowed to speak for my own country : it is mostly because the turn-out during european elections is extremely low in the netherlands ( about 20 % ) . 
  those who do vote , are those who opt for more liberal immigration policies anyway and are in favour of a closer union ( alde parties , greens ) . 
  as a result , the delegation to the european parliament does not represent national politics . 
  shhht ... at least my post disguised that i am actually supporting a brexit , so i can still harvest karma .

   `` i 'm more scared of our governments response to terror than terror itself . '', 
  to be honest , the urge for expansion of the intelligence services and possibilities is moronic and humiliating at the same time . 
  having our rights , as westerners , restricted is exactly what terrorists want and the tories are bending over .

  given how numerous sometimes these small organisations are , it might be just a few hundred thousands kroners at max . 
  the danish government has nothing to stand on , if that organisation decides not to return that money . 
  it might be more useful to track down allied organisations within denmark and norway themselves . 
  there are plentiful charity organisations based in scandinavian countries that just forward the money to palestine instead .
