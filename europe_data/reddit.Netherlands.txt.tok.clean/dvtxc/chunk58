  the autospace after tapping a correction is actually superfluous and should not do more than it is supposed to do : just completing the suggestion . 
   auto-correct is corroding the german language fast and hard oh boy . 
  it 's not even half as bad as the influence on dutch . 
  spotted the jealous estonian / grumpy finn . 
  you should state it differently : * the duty of liberating oppressed brethren by slovak aggressors * !, 
  some eastern neighbour has previously successfully applied this tactic to some peninsula . 
  that goes without saying . 
  please bring this to the dutch grammar check of word . 
  it 's shit sometimes . 
  i would have a full ocd seizure . 
  limburg confirmed not having the same descendence as the rest of the netherlands . 
  hah , eat that , estonia . 
  we ** can ** into nordic . 
  no , they are all grammatically incorrect . 
  unfortunately , the first one is nevertheless frequently seen due to laziness and autocorrect on mobile devices , or simply because of bad grammar knowledge . 
  by the way , i have reversed the word order in my english translations to preserve the distinction of the meaning in dutch . 
  in principle , * disabled parking place * would have been grammatically correct in english in both cases , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  i 'll have to translate the menu items into english and the settings might be highly device specific : settings  language and input  xperia \u2122 keyboard  symbols and smileys  automatic spaces, 
  i 'm trying to describe the functioning of autocorrect regarding the grammar of my non-native/second language using another non-native/second language . 
  that 's because i have been in norway for a half year , so i tried to ` swedify ' my norwegian language skills . 
  :p ( basically switching * - er * to * - ar * , * \u00f8 * to * \u00f6 * and * og * to * och * . 
  maybe i was a bit naive in thinking that would work . ), 
  that 's because i have been in norway for a half year , so i tried to ` swedify ' my ( almost non-existing ) norwegian language skills . 
  - i swear i did n't use translation tools neither did i ever take a swedish language course . 
  just visited the ikea a few times :p, 
   he was n't allowed to travel through schengen ; he just did it . 
  and yet the european commission is furious about the countries that want to prolong border checks within the schengen zone for another term or parties that propose custody for those without papers ... ( actually our house of representatives voted ** against ** the latter 2 days ago . ), 
  recent german auto-correct has actually improved a lot . 
  especially if you deactivate the ` auto space after autocompletion ' , which is enabled by default on android , you can easily create compound nouns . 
  furthermore , it can detect previous prepositions or verbs that come with specific cases , and preselect the suggestions with the corresponding declension of adjectives and nouns . 
  no because depending on the compound parts , the contraction can change the meaning of the word . 
  i can not easily explain this in english , as english does not decline adjectives , but in dutch there is a difference between these two ` noun phrases ' : * laagsteprijsgarantie : * guarantee on the lowest price * * laagste prijsgarantie : * lowest guarantee on a price * * laagste prijs garantie : -- just wrong -- or : * invalidenparkeerplaats : * parking place for disabled * * invalide parkeerplaats : * a disabled parking place * ( i have trouble imagining this ) furthermore , a space between two nouns implies a short-hand genitive relation in dutch , especially in news headings , where we omit `` van de/van een/van '' * ( of the/of a/of ) * . 
  an example of recent news on the coalition formation : * gesprekken formatie vastgelopen : * talks [ of the ] formation stalled * * formatie gesprekken vastgelopen : * formation [ of the ] talks stalled * * formatiegesprekken vastgelopen : * formation talks stalled * a lot of people still erroneously write a space between nouns , because they have n't correctly configured autocorrect . 
  in germany it 's called a `` deppenleerzeichen '' * ( a fool 's space ) * and i think we should introduce a term for it as well , as i often have to reread a sentence sometimes because of these mistakes . 
  i love these compounds . 
  they make a language less ambiguous , more specific and richer . 
  * ^ [ citation ^ needed ] *, 
  maybe i would , if i get to choose where the government spends the surplus tax on . 
  it 's even better : we beat belgium , germany ** and ** finland in this map . 
  * \u00e4 = ae * \u00f6 = oe * \u00fc = ue * \u00df = ss ( in switzerland ), 
  a substantial part of finance articles is generated automatically and written by bots . 
  just as most stock trading is as well . 
  separate the * s * from * ch * . 
  it will make the pronunciation easier . 
  if you pronounce the * ch * in more german , or ` soft way ' , you will get the flemish , or southern dutch pronunciation , which is quite widespread as well . 
   you language is does not have \u00c6 / \u00d8 / \u00c5 so suck it [ ** relevant ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f488ujaqgmw ), 
  to prevent confusion with brazil of course . . 
  more like 1 . remove all declensions like * - es * , * - em * and ditch some more grammar 2 . reverse german consonant shift * ch -  k , ff -  p * to come back to the current german dialects in the north such as plattduutsch dialect or old low prussian dialects . 
  speak dutch fluently . 
  for non-dutchies : * ** duitsland ** : germany * ** oostenrijk ** : austria * ** slowakije ** : slovakia * ** sloveni\u00eb ** : slovenia * ** letland ** : latvia * ** litouwen ** : lithuania * ** tsjechi\u00eb ** : czech republic * ( we honoured your wish , czechs ) * might be harder to correlate to the english/romance/slavic translations on first sight . 
  considering we have huge natural gas reserves ourselves , that 's pretty expensive . 
  there have n't been any reliable polls since the elections . 
  i do n't think there will be new elections , as it is really unusual ( if not out of the question ) to hold new elections if coalition talks fail . 
  if it proves to be necessary , they will rather form a minority cabinet . 
  we just combine the worst of all parties in a coalition agreement , then everyone gets mad and after four years we just reshuffle the whole card deck . 
  surrogacy is already legal in the netherlands , is n't it ? 
  let 's say that you [ went rogue on the party descriptions ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bbhjj/dutch_coalition_formation_has_stalled/dhl9ls4/ ) of all parties that were n't part of the current talks . 
  ** 18:15 ** coalition talks have stalled . 
  more information will be given in a press conference at 18:30 ** background information ** the parties vvd - cda - d66 - groenlinks have tried to form a coalition from the beginning . 
  for more english information about the parties and their policies : see this [ ** megathread ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zdblx/dutch_general_election_2017_megathread/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ) ** 18:40 ** at the press conference it has become clear that immigration policy could not be agreed upon . 
  groenlinks ( greenleft ) on the one hand and vvd ( econ liberal-conservatives ) and cda ( christian democrats ) on the other hand were known to have very differing stances on immigration before the elections . 
  today it became clear that this gap could not be bridged . 
  topics such as climate policy and welfare have been toughening talks in the last days . 
  ** 18:45 ** coalition talks are expected to start from scratch again on may the 18th . 
  the mean formation time of all coalition talks since 1945 is 89.5 days . 
  as of today , 60 days have passed since the dutch general elections on march the 15th . 
  ** 18:53 ** dutch public broadcaster ( nos ) has started [ a liveblog on its website ] ( http://nos.nl/liveblog/2173344-formatie-kabinet-vastgelopen.html ) . 
  ** 18:54 ** the speaker of the house of representatives ( head of the parliament ) , khadija arib , has been notified and will release a more elaborate report on the talks as soon as possible . 
  ** 18:55 ** prime-minister mark rutte has stated he regrets that the coalition talks have stalled . 
  he states `` we have put serious efforts in this . 
  we wanted to turn this into a success , but we have not been able to accomplish that . '', 
  ** background information ** the combination vvd - cda - d66 - groenlinks would have comprised 85 / 150 seats . 
  a clear majority . 
  the other most speculated combination , which has not been tried yet , with cu instead of groenlinks has a very thin majority of 76 / 150 . 
  the conservative anti-immigration party pvv , second biggest party -- which attained 20 seats , has already been excluded from any coalition talks prior to the elections . 
  ** 19:02 ** party leader of the greens ( groenlinks ) has stated : the gaps were too big on topics such as immigration and climate change . 
  we could not accept a continuation of this . 
  ** 19:03 ** other party leaders ( d66 and cda ) have expressed themselves similarly . 
  ** 19:24 ** [ geert wilders has tweeted ] ( https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/864158761400893440 ) : `` 1 . 
  very good news : no groenlinks , 2 . 
  the pvv ( 2nd-biggest party ) is available for coalition talks . '', 
  however , the pvv has been exclused from any talks by all major parties . 
  ** background information ** a cooperation with the cu would be quite problematic with the d66 , as they have very differing stances on drugs and euthanasia legalisation . 
  furthermore , the previous coalition has gained experience with parliament members who suddenly left the party . 
  these members remain the right to keep their seat and , thus continue as an independent member of parliament . 
  vvd-d66-cda-cu would comprise a total of 76 / 150 seats , so they can not afford someone suddenly leaving the coalition . 
  it is a very very thin majority and with the experiences of the previous coalition in mind , this thin majority scares the coalition parties .

  ** background information ** stalled talks have been resumed in the past . 
  this happened the last time in 1994 . 
  ** 20:30 ** socialist party leader , emile roemer , has stated : `` i predicted this from the very beginning . 
  [ ... ] i would like to have a debate tomorrow on this very topic and on how we should continue . '',

  well , you might add the / s , but it could certainly have a statistical effect . 
  air pollution could definitely manipulate the temperature a few tens of centigrades . 
  a more extreme example : a volcanic cloud can induce a year-long global winter as happened twice in the 19th century , causing snowfall in new york during summer .
