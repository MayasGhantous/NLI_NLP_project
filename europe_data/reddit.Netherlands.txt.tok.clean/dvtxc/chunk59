   it 's not just about the quality , it 's also about the deaf community being kind of hesitant about having their culture eradicated . 
  those kind of people are usually found in the dutch bible belt here . 
  already waiting for / u/humankapital291 to release his tirade ... 
   30 % pass hauptschule here , after some extra rounds . 
  of how many who have been admitted in the first place ? 
  because otherwise , i start to seriously doubt the level of hauptschule in germany . 
   they 're not holding anyone back and they benefit , so why not . 
  the teachers will most likely have to be trained on how to cope with down kids . 
  these kids need specialised support throughout their entire time at school . 
   a lot of deaf people do n't like cochelar implants at all . 
  that 's why i said i would like to devote those funds to make them better . 
  why would you stay at this level and say that nobody wants them , because they quality is crap at * this * moment ? 
   the universities in the netherlands are sexy as fuck just make sure you do n't come to the tu eindhoven . 
  the graveyard style of brutalist building , combined with the sausagefest in the sex ratio of students will make you depressive within one semester . 
   down syndrome kids should n't have too much trouble in hauptschul-level courses down syndrome kids have absolutely no place in a general school . 
  in the past decades only a handful of pupils with down syndrome managed to pass the examination of our lowest-tier ( ! ), 
  of secondary education , called the vmbo . 
  if one manages to pass the abi , [ it actually reaches the news ] ( http://www.eenvandaag.nl/binnenland/33630/meisje_met_down_haalt_vmbo_diploma ) . 
   why not sign language . 
  you can always do if you want . 
  but let 's say that generally speaking , you do n't hope to have to use it in your lifetime . 
  i would rather dedicate all the funds to make cochlear implants much better and affordable for everyone on a shorter time scale , than sign language lessons on every school . 
  if you want , you can learn sign language in language centres dedicated to this task . 
   especially with the hauptbahnhof business . 
  i missed something ... ? 
  [ ** 10.000 voters switched from the greens to the afd ** ] ( http://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2017-05-14-lt-de-nw/charts/analyse-wanderung/chart_73191.jpg ) how ? 
  -- ** edit : ** i have seen everything : [ fdp votes can switch to die linke ] ( http://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2017-05-14-lt-de-nw/charts/analyse-wanderung/chart_73193.jpg ), 
   handicapped children in regular classes is a great idea in principle , however , you have to do it right , it has to be appropriate for the class and the handicapped student meaning a decentralised investment in all facilities a quadriplegic needs in a building , right ? 
  but apart from physical handicaps , the greens over here want to integrate those with special * mental * needs as well , which hinders other students in a much severe way . 
  but you could get our crazy system of extreme proportional representation :d some seats for the animal party , some seats for the turkish grey wolves , some seats for the pensioners ' party, 
  the situation here is funnier : up to 2 years ago , a student could get $ 300 a month for studying when they were n't living at home , or up to $ 600 a month when the parents earned less than about $ 20k a year . 
  this money was a ` gift ' if you managed to complete your studies within a timespan of 10 years . 
  ( seems doable , right ? 
  / s ) due to austerity cuts , you can now only apply for student loan with a max of $ 1000 a month . 
  since some students have found out that the payback is a mess and will be fully interest-free for the coming decade due to fixation on the current super low interest rates , they all suddenly increased this loan to the very max of $ 1000 a month / or $ 12.000 a year . 
  a large portion of students is projected not be able to pay this amount back , and their debts will be acquitted under the current student loan regulations . 
  remove that 5 % barrier and let the green party split up nationwide into a left/fundamentalist wing and a bw-variant wing . 
  it will most probably make more people happier . 
  even though i am an atheist myself , i would rather take the support of the christenunie over groenlinks indeed , but it would make the cooperation with d66 even more problematic . 
  furthermore , the previous coalition has gained experience with parliament members who suddenly left the party . 
  these members remain the right to keep their seat and , thus continue as an independent member of parliament . 
  vvd-d66-cda-cu would comprise a total of 76 / 150 seats , so they can not afford someone suddenly leaving the coalition . 
  it is a very very thin majority and with the experiences of the previous coalition in mind , this thin majority scares the coalition parties . 
  the fvd is a really new party so they will most probably be rejected by the current older parties . 
  furthermore , d66 is very pro-eu -- almost eu-federalist , whereas the fvd criticises the eu in its party programme and is considered an eu-sceptic party . 
   where my csu-led land is flying off charts . 
  currently they are trying to form a coalition with vvd - d66 - cda - groenlinks ( the greenleft ) cda ( christians ) voters are triggered by d66 ( liberals ) who want to legalise euthanasia and all soft drugs . 
  d66 voters are triggered since they have to cooperate with a confessional party . 
  vvd voters are triggered by ` car hating ' groenlinks and the same holds the other way around as groenlinks voters are triggered by the ` bankers party ' . 
  so , if you want a tl : dr of this possible coalition : literally everyone is triggered . 
   they forced all handicapped children into regular school classes . 
  it can be benefitial for the handicapped , but it turned out to be a major burden onto the non-handicapped . 
  oh god . 
  that 's what the greens want over here as well . 
  and they 're currently forming a coalition . 
  it wo n't surprise me if they will break down the gymnasiums and all other special school types as well over here once they get the opportunity . 
   the infrastructure is ancient can confirm . 
  the border crossings to nrw start to look like the border crossings with belgium . 
  -- are the autobahnen administered by the * bundes/federal * government or the * landes/regional * government ? 
  ( i am asking since there is a strict distinction in the netherlands : rijkswegen/highways administered by the * rijk/country * and n-wegen/provincial roads by the provinces ), 
  but ... but ... it fitted their coat of arms so nicely !, 
  :d / s yes , imo , the greens still got 1 percentpoint too much . 
  damn , those two boys announcing the jury votes were creepy . 
  completely neutral . 
  some of the wealthiest countries in europe are not part of the eu either . 
  i think the uk can perfectly handle an exit from the eu , opposed to mainland countries which might be more dependent on neighbouring countries . 
  historic city centers, 
  producer of germany 's entry worked with david guetta as well , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  well i did n't state that nothing applies to me at all . 
  read again , it 's the ** median ** wealth . 
  median = / = mean, 
  following that logic , i am surprised about the dutch position , as car ownership is relatively low in the netherlands compared to other west-european countries due to the immense costs of possessing a car . 
  quite a large amount of people lease a car from their company instead . 
   ( except russia i guess ) russia 's feeling about the wwii are completely different . 
  the prevailing emotion is the perceived lack of recognition of russia 's suffering . 
  russia suffered almost 30 million deaths , which is by far the highest amount of all nations involved in the second world war . 
  to a certain extent , the emotion is justifiable , as we primarily get to know about the american , british and canadian efforts of liberation . 
  russia 's and poland 's action are barely mentioned during history lessons . 
  greeks have a higher median wealth than germans ? 
  retrospective debt collection in 3 ... 2 ... 
   even though the goods only passed through there . 
  and pay fees to the port , if i am not mistaken . 
   interesting though how different the netherlands and for example neighbouring germany are in that regard . 
  well ... if germany was comparable to r/de , most people would be occupied with producing afd bashing memes . 
  it is good they do n't have our pvv , which is so much worse in many regards . 
  germany could not handle the shock of such a party getting 13 % on national level , whereas we got used to them by now . 
  short hand , usually expressing it implicitly . 
   you ca n't on the one hand criticize that it is n't a homogeneous group , and then turn around and come up with this false dichotomy . 
  according to mainstream media and my age : i should vote for the greens , be high-educated , backpack and tramp around europe , do everything by bicycle , love the eu , spend 30 days a year on a festival , only do biologic groceries in a shop that 's five times more expensive than a regular supermarket , and have a five figure student loan debt . 
  the pulse of europe has appeared a few times one the front page of our public news broadcaster , while in reality the dutch edition drew a total of 12 ** ( !, 
  perhaps not lying , but clearly lacking nuance and biased in the news selection . 
  `` young , educated people '' are a homogeneously thinking group according to all mainstream media in the netherlands as well . 
  their thoughts should be the golden standard , whereas those who have a bit more life experience should beggar off . 
  burn all pre-eu history ? 
  that 's an interesting language they speak in morocco and algeria . . 
  til, 
  it 's only a pity that especially muslims in european countries tend to be very hostile towards jews . 
  multiple documentaries on dutch public television have shown that wearing a kippah is guarantee to be threatened by moroccan and algerian youth in some neighbourhoods in for example amsterdam . 
  a running camera of television crew did not prevent these kids ( ! ), 
  from saying that they should be killed and nazi germany did right .
