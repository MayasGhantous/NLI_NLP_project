  :p ) we radically changed our complete healthcare system in 2005 . 
  some parties ( e.g. 
  * sp * , socialists ) want to completely overthrow it again , some ( e.g. 
  * vvd * , lib-dems ) want to make the coverage more selective . 
  to be honest , i think i do n't know enough about other 's healthcare systems to be truly able to judge it , yet i do know that some patients sometimes seek treatment across the border in belgium and germany since waiting lists tend to be shorter over there . 
  a trend that is , however , noticeable since last year is that some medicines tend to become scarce , since a lot of pharmaceutical companies do not see our market as profitable and therefore just stop producing certain medication for our market . 
  [ here is the source ( in dutch , so just paste the link in google translate ) ] ( http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/gezondheid/steeds-meer-medicijnen-zijn-schaars-en-goed-alternatief-ontbreekt-vaak ), 
   in 2015 we had one of the largest rises in mortality we 've had since the second world war . 
  that actually sounds really negative , apart from the fact that he mentions * one of the * instead of * the largest * . . how does the british health system work ? 
  i constantly hear something about the nhs , but do not have an actual understanding of its working principle . . how private or how collaborative is the british health system ? 
   and looking at the neglected infrastructure we ought to pay more in the next decade . 
  please do n't say you 're going to postpone those infrastructural reparation projects even more . 
  our caravans wo n't take it . 
  * roderik * , * jan-willem * and * karel * . 
  i knew it !, 
  i suggest you to reread my comment , which i left unchanged , but * addressing * = / = * solving * . 
  that 's something i did not deny in my post . 
  still , these numbers are a little bit skewed . 
  it 's actually more shocking if you correct for what portion of the population is actually moroccan , giving you the numbers as * part per demographic group * that is being detained . 
  thanks for finding that and yes that translation is quite accurate . 
  nevertheless , 80 hours community service is quite a joke imho . 
  it 's something you would give for theft in a supermarket or clothing store . 
   this problem has been festering for a long time and wilders is one of the few who calls the problem out for what it is . 
  this is a problem as well . 
  yes , he 's one of the few who actually ** addresses ** the problem , yet i doubt he will actually be able to effectively do something ( within dutch jurisdiction for example ) and be able to form a coalition for 4 years , since no party wants to cooperate with him ( although vvd will trade everything for continuing their governing and they did before in 2010 ) the problem with current politics seems that every proposed solution is either ` there is no problem and let 's continue to drink tea ' or ` repatriate and deport them all ' . 
  no problem . 
  keep an eye on the reddit threads in march , i would say . 
  we will have national elections . 
  well , i 've never worn such kind of t shirt so i ca n't confirm that , yet i can confirm i 've been threatened because of smaller things by aforementioned * groups * in your mentioned * capitals * . 
  as an example : i 've learned my lesson that i should n't say anything anymore or look at all when someone breaks open the doors to the underground railway for free , and i should just keep looking down the floor instead . 
  i can tell you that what happened hereafter was one of the least pleasant experiences in public transport . 
  this was not an incident and i know that people have had similar experiences . 
  '' `` incidentally '' '' they all look alike . 
  or tell me the city you 're living in , because i really would love to meet those inhabitants , considering your description . 
   considering the quality of your comment history wow . 
  cool argument . 
  maybe i should n't take you serious considering your previous flair * linksversift und stolz darauf * ... 
  that 's because moroccans and turks form a large part of the foreigners in our country and at the same are known to fare high in the criminality charts and statistics . 
  these two ethnicities form a relatively big part of the society since they came to the netherlands as guest workers in the 60s and 70s , along with italians and spaniards btw . 
  though the former two have almost become synonymous for criminality for anti-immigration parties such as the pvv , which only emerged about 10 years ago . 
  it would be a bit ironic if he was completely against foreigners as funnily though his wife is hungarian . 
  * anti-eu : yes , very much . 
  he actually wants a nexit referendum . 
  * right-wing : doubtful , some economic stances tend to be left-wing , some right-wing . 
  economically it is hard to define his party . 
  * anti-foreigners : well , especially anti-islam . 
  the party is more affiliated with the french front national as farage did n't want to be in the same european party as wilders , though le pen did . 
  though , we have another anti-eu party which does cooperate with ukip : namely vnl , which splitted from our pvv a few years ago . 
  well that 's why this trial is becoming so dready now . 
  wilders ' lawyers say he only meant * criminal moroccans * , while the prosecutors insist that wilders is out on demonising the * entire moroccan community * and everyone with moroccan roots in the netherlands . 
  during municipal elections in 2014 the anti-immigration party of wilders received quite some votes in the municipalities in which the party contested . 
  ( they did n't in all ) on the evening of the elections , when the first results came in , wilders held a speech to a crowd of party members and followers as is usual to do for many parties on the evening of the elections . 
  at some point wilders asked the crowd : * `` do you all want more or less moroccans in this city and in the netherlands ? 
  '' * on which the crowd responded by chanting : * `` less !, 
  less !, 
  less !, 
  less !, 
  '' * wilders answers by saying : * `` then we 're going to fix that !, 
  '' * this was broadcasted live on public television . 
  source : https://youtu.be/bab75uznt8o he asks three questions in this video : * do you want more or less european union ? 
  * do you want more or less labour party ? 
  ( one of the key opponents of wilders ' party ) * do you want more or less moroccans in this city and in the netherlands ? 
  he is being prosecuted for saying that last phrase . 
  actually , it was n't even that unexpected per-s\u00e9 . 
  sure , it was a shock at that time , but he had said multiple times that he feared to be assassinated . 
   on a few occasions , fortuyn expressed his fear of being murdered : after being pied at the official release of his book [ ... ] and , most notably , on various talk-shows . 
  after his death some media and key political opponents have been accused of * demonisation * as they had created the circumstances which made the assassination possible . 
  wilders has received ( less formal ) death threats as well , one noticeable example in this rap song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlrrhhbm6qk ( 4:32 ) , as the author of this song had been sued ( do n't remember the outcome , but i ca n't remember he was eventually actually being prosecuted for it ) . 
  let 's say we have [ experience with political murders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pim_fortuyn ) in this part of the political spectrum . 
  he had one ( part-time ) body guard . 
  wilders has literally an army of almost full-time body guards around him . 
  wherever he shows up in public , wilders has a human shield around him , which is quite strange to see if you compare it to how other politicians are able to walk freely in the public . 
  hell , [ even our king shows up with considerably less ( visible ) protection ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgujzvm0juw ) . 
  no mexico ? 
  disappointed . 
  these maps by jakubmarian leave me always wondering : if this is a conformal conic projection map ( which seems to be the most fitting one ) , how can iceland be not on the map ?? 
  where is iceland ? 
  slovenia can into western europe . 
  what 's up with transnistria ? 
  * hrvatske ustase * ( i 'm not going to link the vid here ) just got a whole different connotation ... ( although i 'm still interested where that actually came from ), 
  replace * norwegian * by * belgian * and you will be a successfully naturalised and integrated dutchman . 
  have been on the autobahn . 
  can confirm . 
  though signage becomes inconsistent once you get on smaller roads . 
  we can solve this . 
  can we have luxembourgish clay ? 
  after that , we change some tax regulations , so it becomes a tax heaven-light , like we are now . 
  we got mountains !, 
  ** grabs popcorn , and starts watching outlander on netflix ... *, 
  yeah , so just do n't recognise our representatives in the european parliament ?? 
  you know , 32 % is more than 50 seats in our house of representatives ? 
  let 's just give them the finger as well in the future . 
  there is literally no logic in not accepting a referendum with 32 % turn-out , if they managed to get more than the required 30 % ( a pre-set * legislative * threshold ) and if they managed to get the required amount of signatures ** twice ** . 
  if you do n't like the turn-out rules , you should change them , but it has been set this way by law , and they managed to get the required turn out . 
  to all the people that have been crying here , i can only say : stop crying and change things if you do n't like it . 
  username u/closetintrovert checks out . 
  rutte ? 
  r/cirkeltrek is r/europe binnengevallen . 
  considering the main trend in some recent sentences , i actually support the introduction of minimum sentences by law , whereas maximum sentences already exist . 
  calm down bud ...
