  i have seen more jewish people openly expressing their faith in the us than here in europe . 
  i do n't know how the hostilities are exactly in german cities with large muslim populations , but the aforementioned documentaries caused a shock on dutch television . 
  although it had been assumed for a long time , the threats were visible in a clear way and on a large scale in one television production for the first time . 
  it 's equal or lower , as the overseas territories of netherlands have n't been included on this map . 
  at least three caribbean islands are the netherlands proper . 
  i am not sure whether the ** netherlands ** is part of the benelux or ** kingdom of the netherlands ** . 
  in the latter case , it will comprise 6 overseas territories . 
  cura\u00e7ao has a quite big oil refinery and a big tourism industry . 
  well , the netherlands has a really big indonesian immigrant group due to its colonial history . 
  reeee , stop . 
  i have already been notified about the shitty maths . 
  xd now i have to make the difficult decision between further harvesting karma or removing this post to preserve dignity . 
  i will downvote my own post . 
  for real ? 
  if this is true , this would be the best troll i have heard in a long time and would make all jokes on belgium outdated . 
  any tips for a company ? 
  do n't forget all multinationals of the world dodging their taxes over here : with the famous example of ikea being headquartered thrice in the netherlands . 
  russian is the funniest one : gaga, 
  shhhhht , r/shittymaths although it 's actually ** 10 = 11 ** , since you subtracted the uk twice , you are right . 
  [ i already did ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6abtvw/countries_with_a_combined_gdp_equal_to_that_of/ ) , 
  damn it . 
  just closed the excel sheet . 
  i am too lazy to retrieve the data again . 
  u/pseudopsud proposed a small revision , 
  yeah , you are right : i should have added the uk instead of india to the green coloured countries . 
  [ from the mighty benelux ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a9suc/countries_with_a_combined_gdp_equal_to_that_of/ ) to the mighty eu . 
   congo ~ ~ colony ~ ~ human zoo ?? 
  ftfy, 
  ah yes , you are right . 
  haha , i was impressed when i got to know that they also produce high-grade military equipment besides public transport gates/tourniquets . 
  you forgot ship building , unilever , corus/tata steel , dsm , akzonobel in the secondary sector . 
  daf is nothing in comparison with them . 
  furthermore , there has been a huge push new internet companies such as adyen and booking.com, 
  always those scandinavian people relating everything to their crime series ... 
  you really ca n't handle his two seats , can you ? 
  whatever , keep the circlejerk from the media and r/thenetherlands going . 
  pvdd , fvd and sp can all be considered as * eu sceptic * parties . 
  perhaps just not as hard-line anti-eu as the pvv . 
  furthermore , the cda won seats by using campaign rhetoric which was very similar to pvv rhetoric from a few years ago to regain the seats they lost in the polls . 
  the [ overton window ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/overton_window ) has been shifted towards a more eu-sceptic and immigrant restrictive view in the netherlands . 
  on the plus side , we got a new eu-sceptic party in our parliament , increasing the choice in eu-sceptic flavours to 4 . 
  it now includes socialist eu skepticism , environmental eu skepticism , nationalist eu skepticism , and progressive eu skepticism . 
  ** edit ** i did n't downvote you for your opinion , but whatever floats your boat . 
   i would n't expect that from you . 
  excuse me , but do you know each other ? 
  anti-eu parties almost doubled their results in these three countries though ... 
  what if you combine them ? 
  give me that time machine and i will bet on brexit , trump and i will invest in some bitcoins . 
  and do you know what residence data they use ? 
  right , the amount of people with an immigrant background for example . 
  insurance companies have enormously rich risk equalisation databases in which they also take the ethnographic composition of a neighbourhood up to zip code level into account . 
  funnily enough they are willing to give up the northern part . 
  must be the fall out area . 
  r/finlandconspiracy /, 
  they could use some ` diversity ' in their naming as well . 
  it 's already the fifth month they call exactly the same . 
  we could get a * northern euro * perhaps instead . 
  those ideas are n't new by the way . 
  to be really honest , i wonder whether the situation in libya could get any worse at this point . 
  it 's half run by bedouin factions , half run by is . 
   everything they ever stood for has been achieved , aside from the normalization of pedophilia . 
  do n't say that too quickly . 
  they will come up with new things once they achieved their goals . 
  like getting alternative medicine exempted from tax in the netherlands . 
  with the majority of the backwards voters coming from our countries ( germany and the netherlands ) , it might have been better if we had outlawed the last referendum as well . 
  would have been better for the turkish population . 
  ** triggered *, 
  nope . 
  usually without walnuts . 
  if i do , i make sure they are skinless , but that 's quite a tedious job to do . 
  pine nuts are a lot softer and blend in with a salad . 
  for a side dish , it takes some time to make , but it 's delicious . 
  welcome to xxx . 
  please have a look to your right . 
  and now have a look to your left . 
  the persons to your right and to your left will be gone in half a year . 
  this was literally the first phrase i heard when i started as freshman . 
  our renewed education systems states that if one fails to attain a minimum of 45 ects within the first year of the bachelor , one is forced to stop that programme and not allowed to study that particular programme anymore for 5 years . 
  furthermore , we do have tuition fees of about $ 2000 a year , and you can get half of that amount back if you stop within 6 months . 
  therefore it is quite normal to see literally half of the students drop out within the first months , especially at technical study programmes . 
  ironically , the universities receive money from the government based on the numbers of students that enrol at the start of the academic year . 
  they do n't care about how much they filter out throughout a year . 
   wilders ' pvv is the best known dutch one i think unfortunately , that 's also the least democratic party of the political spectrum here ( you can not even become a member , for example ) and has quite some nitwits in the party and , therefore , has pretty much shifted to `` we are against everything , as long as we just get that damned border control back '' . 
  they would reintroduce our old currency `` guilder '' and trade tariffs even it resulted in a complete economical isolation . 
  there are about 4 eu-sceptical parties currently represented in our parliament accounting for 41 out of 150 seats in total . 
  so one could say , we have the richest choice in eu-sceptic voices of all european countries . 
  yet i do not see any of these parties entering the currently forming coalition . 
  you say that as if i have stated that i despise democracy . 
  i know and that 's why i will use all and solely democratic means to prevent the formation of such a federation and , else take emigration into consideration . 
   eu vp an ** undemocratically / indirectly ** elected first vice-president indirectly elected by the european commission , which in turn is indirectly elected as well . 
  you did n't understand me . 
  i despise a possible federalisation of the eu , while in the meanwhile i see the process advancing . 
  which is a reason i will never vote for an alde party in european elections in the first place . 
   in aspiration of something bigger . 
  * sigh *, 
  water and copper ? 
  the electroconductivity of that lake must be great . 
  the amount of stubbornness is baffling .
