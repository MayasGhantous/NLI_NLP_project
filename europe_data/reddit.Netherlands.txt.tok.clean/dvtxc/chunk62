  we have seen it with surveillance , now weapons , and the next thing will be car driving . 
  i fully stand with the swiss , norwegian and czech in this thread . 
  it 's not only with gun laws . 
  they do the same with intelligence and surveillance laws . 
  the netherlands has seen some draconian surveillance reforms in the past months , because of the increasing ` terrorist threat ' . 
  they tell us that the right is using the attacks to their benefit , while actually several countries and the eu itself are waiting for these events to push this legislation further .

  i am able to view all programs of the public broadcasters ( including regional channels ) abroad . 
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/zdfmediathk/ https://mediathekview.de/, 
  can i ask you what broadcast it was ? 
  one of the main tageesschau broadcasts ( e.g. 
  20:00 ) or the evening tagesthemen ? 
  they often say the same about the netherlands , whereas rotterdam , the hague and surrounding suburbs are anti-immigration party strongholds . 
  the only country in which this might be actually true is germany , where sachsen , mvp and sachsen-anhalt voted in favour of the afd , despite having the lowest share of non-western immigrants . 
   people who immigrate to europe are not salafists , they 're generally well-educated or else fleeing from those very same salafists . 
  yes , those turks we have here and voted erdogan into power are clearly well-educated immigrants . 
  those ~ ~ moroccans ~ ~ berbers we got are clearly highly educated and integrated : the ** third generation ** does not even properly speak dutch . 
  70 % of the immigrants from somali who have been here for * more than 5 years * , receive wealthfare [ ** ( source ) ** ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2015/31/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand ) , must be higly-educated as well . 
   the problem then is the racists or those overly scared like you who think that arab = salafi or muslim = salafi and rush off to vote for brexit or actual nazis like le pen . 
  assuming i am scared of terrorism . 
  everyone writes the same and thinks i am someone who does not dare to come outside anymore . 
  to be honest , i do not even care that much about radicalising salafis as you think , as i know that the chance of becoming a victim of a terrorist attack is extremely small . 
  i am sick of deteriorating neighbourhoods due to small crimes which are almost exclusively committed by these ` so-called skilled immigrants ' . 
  once someone mentions correlations , you are accused of mentioning the elephant in the room . 
  and no , i am not a farmer voting in a region which has not even seen an immigrant ( something afd voters get accused of the east of germany ) . 
  i live in the city with the highest share of non-western immigrants of the netherlands . 
  i know what i am talking about . 
  you assume i oppose immigration from syria . 
  i am speaking of the flux of low-skilled immigrants the netherlands has seen since the sixties and continues to this very day . 
  \\ #keeplofotennorwegian, 
  seeing namers of regions that end on * - nia * reminds me of reading tintin , but til that ostrobothnia and savonia are not fictional . 
  inb4 someone says : * `` i have never met a person who started squealing about nazism when reasonable immigration reduction policies were brought up in a discussion . 
  you can be accused for being a ` nazi ' as soon as you say some organisations in the mediterranean support or facilitate trafficking . 
  they might be not representative for the left , but i have met these kind of people . 
  that 's why i do n't even bring up these kind of topics anymore in any conversation . 
  just nod and move on to the next topic , as playing mine sweeper is even more relaxing . 
  though , since i have heard them expressing support for afa and squatters as well and one even sympathised with raf goals i got the impression they might be not completely sane either . 
  somehow these people are usually easily found in cities such as amsterdam and berlin .

  aha , i noticed something strange as well , even with my limited geographical knowledge of france . 
  i remember the regions of languedoc-rousillion and alsace-lorraine on a map . 
  nouvelle acquitaine was definitely smaller or subdivided as well . 
  what happened ? 
  wait , this guy has * high energy * ? 
  o neighbours ... 
  based on documentaries i have seen on the french elections , she still seems to be more reasonable , especially getting closer to the elections . 
  furthermore , the pvv is still a very weird party without any party members . 
  at least , the fn actually has ( participating ) party members and a youth organisation . 
  wilders is running a one-man organisation and accepts no criticism . 
  lol , he has been nicknamed * teflon-mark * here , because whatever problem you throw at him , he just smiles and ~ ~ seemingly resolves ~ ~ creatively twists the issue without being hurt in the polls . 
  still better than wilders though . 
  ^ ^ got ^ ^ her ^ ^ as ^ ^ well,

  actually , the renowned and most-cited researcher on * publications * and * meta-research * is a greek , john ioannidis . 
  his publication * `` why most published research findings are false '' * is an interesting read . 
  meh , an approximation is easy to calculate using logarithms . 
  [ / breaking the joke ], 
  yes , ballot papers in turkey are written in english . 
   i thought he was upside down ~ ~ russia ~ ~ yugoslavia ? 
  get your flags right . 
  fun fact : although fraktur was heavily used in nazi germany , hitler 's favourite font was actually futura . 
  contemporary users of the futura font include ikea , volkswagen , hp , and royal dutch shell . 
  nope , this ballot was written in fraktur : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/stimmzettel-anschluss.jpg, 
  i would need some help with the turkish translation though ... 
  see , see !!, 
  both your and the turkish flag have red colours !, 
  both your stripe and the turkish moon and star are white !, 
  i knew it !, 
  you bear resemblance !, 
  this fits his accusations towards us better .

  would have been a small effort to download the fraktur font and recreate one for the turkish situation .

  lol , i remember this joke from long ago ( this one was told at primary school ) * an earthquake happened in the centre of istanbul , killing a thousand and leaving at least a tenfold homeless . 
  european countries decide to combine their efforts for humanitarian aid . 
  germany sends in ten thousand tents . 
  belgium sends in ten thousand food supply packages . 
  what does the netherlands send ? 
  * * a thousand turks back . 
  the netherlands is already indicating 70,29 % . 
  okay , let 's introduce some anecdotal proof then . 
  i know quite some turks , as i live in/near one of the big cities in the netherlands . 
  some of them are or have been close friends of mine for a long time . 
  if about a third of them supported something like this , it would ** not ** surprise me . 
  that 's less than these results show , but that is a underestimation as i only know those who attend university and are higher educated .
