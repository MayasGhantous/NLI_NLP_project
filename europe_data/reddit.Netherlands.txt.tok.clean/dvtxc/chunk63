  similar figures exist for the 2015 turkish general election . 
  to be honest , 68 % does not surprise me at all . 
  well , one of my closest friends was turkish and always seemed to be an ordinary girl ( born here ) . 
  at some point at university she suddenly started wearing a head scarf . 
  after a few months she changed all her profile pictures to photos featuring turkish flags in the background . 
  now she exclusively twitters in turkish and retweets anti-kurdi propaganda including military related material . 
  total timespan : about two years . 
  as someone in this thread mentioned , about half a million turks live within the netherlands . 
  it is safe to assume that about 68 % of them went through a similar process of change . 
  good luck living with that fifth column . 
  i have to confess though , turkish pizza with d\u00f6ner is delicious and fits any time of the day . 
  nos : * `` dutch turks are becoming more progressive . 
  the netherlands went from europe 's most akp-loving country [ in 2015 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_november_2015 ) to the third most akp-loving country in 2017 . 
  * ** before 2000 : ** ignoring slowly progressing changes . 
  * `` do n't mention ze immigration problems . 
  '' * * ** 2002 : ** the moment someone influential actually named the problem , the person was shot . 
  * ** after 2002 : ** people went either fully pro-immigration , or fully anti-immigration . 
  the population polarised in both directions to the extent that we have occasional news articles `` explaining the other side of the population '' in a fruitless attempt to bridge the gap . 
  i think it 's the localised transliteration of the word * aladeen *, 
  do n't know why you got downvoted , because that is exactly the hint i meant . 
  baltics ... especially estonia : wtf ? 
  you did not pay attention to the teuton 's instructions . 
   this was posted 4 days ~ ~ ago ~ ~ early ftfy, 
  maybe we should call this celestial body * europe * instead ? 
  just to maximise the confusion . 
  it has nu use to label denk as either a left-wing or right-wing party and is actually hard to define according to the classic distinction . 
  their alleged alliance to the grey wolves in turkey is more worrisome . 
  the last patches of the byzantine empire . . rip, 
  feudalism , never again . 
  this is too much to handle . 
  basically everyone seemed to claim his own patch of grass somewhere ... 
   quite hypocritical considering the turkish passport issue and how they ca n't distance themselves from it . 
  should be rather easy for them to go back . 
  and exactly because of this , i do not understand why right-wing and centre-right parties in the netherlands embrace single citizenship . 
  allow double citizenship , but just make it clear that if you constantly criticise our country and our liberal values , whilst at the same time you reap the profits with your second passport , your ground to stay here should be questioned . 
  looks more like the dutch flag to me at this angle . 
  i can not really explain the remarkable white stripes when the flags cross though . 
  it seems to be a mix of three flags , with the third being a fully white flag . . * ^ ^ hint *, 
  meh , who cares about the purists from bergen anyway . 
  i have become suspicious of all these maps . 
  i am still looking for the hidden clue . 
  ** edit : ** kosovars might get triggered, 
  greece lost some of its islands . 
  i mean , some of them are not particularly inhabited by greeks the last two years or so anyway , but that does not mean greece should be punished for that . 
  disappointed . 
  it took me a while ... 
  except for the fact that the * ` eu ' * is pronounced as an ** \u00f6 ** in dutch , so it would not be too embarrassing when pronounced . 
  you know you 've been browsing r/europe for too long if you unconsciously start memorising people 's flair texts and user names . 
  * ( same applies to me , and yes i know which flair you mean xd ) *, 
  i learned it . 
  i am only able to passively translate it . 
  most people who learned latin or ancient greek are only able to read it , but do not have an active vocabulary , let alone fluency . 
  did you mean * brazilian * ? 
  [ this should be poland 's national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nz04bg7tfa ), 
  pls , someone , make a relevant poland ball bot . 
  fine , we get cuxhaven and levy taxes on all passing ships . 
  would be better though . 
  would temper the arrogance of the inhabitants of amsterdam a bit . 
  i like the fact they even tried to translate all the towns , even though some are wrong or translated literally . 
  they have practically been in almost every coalition with the exception between 1998 and 2009 . 
  so , it ca n't just be the fdp itself . 
  what went so different this time ? 
  what happened in 2010 that impacted the popularity of the union/fdp coalition so much ? 
  you have misspelled ostpreu\u00dfen . 
  i am constantly baffled by the sheer size of various subreddits . 
   hamon i have to do some * research * on her . 
  who is she ? 
  legendary . 
  now i have to visit helsinki as well . 
  interesting . 
  i support this pragmatic green thinking . 
  though knowing how green party politics is like in other countries , especially in europe , i have to say i 'm sceptical . 
  it might be a little bit off-topic over here , but can someone from finland eli5 what the finnish green party 's stances on other topics is ( apart from energy ) ? 
  what is it like ? 
  sorry , but not every country suddenly got a phobia for nuclear energy in the last 10 years . 
  i see nuclear energy as a great investment to bridge the gap to a fully fossil-free energy production on a much shorter time scale . 
  nuclear energy has seen a lot of iterative improvements , including safety , since the reactor generations from fukushima and chernobyl . 
  i would really love to see the inherently safe powder bed fission reactors or uranium-free molten-salt reactors on a production scale . 
  sure , green energy is something that will have the future as well , but just is not ready to be deployed at such a large extent that it will cover an entire country 's energy demand . 
  at least not in such a way that keeps energy affordable . 
  if germany will truly make the transition to green energy ( including production facilities and industry ) within the projected time frame , including a nearing boom in electric cars , energy will just become unaffordable over there very soon . 
  several countries in europe have more lenient gun legislation in various ways as well , including czechia , lithuania , switzerland , balkan countries and norway . 
  to be honest , it might be the case if you solely look at cities . 
  i have no idea whether one can look up those data for german cities , but as an example : [ amsterdam-west ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/archives/images/jongenswest.jpg ) ( 2016 data ) source : [ het parool ] ( http://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/dit-waren-in-2016-de-populairste-babynamen-per-stadsdeel~a4452646/ ) ( scroll down for an interactive map of amsterdam ), 
  she is british , but born in paris . 
  i knew this thread was going to be useful for something . 
  thanks . 
  now i got this song stuck in my head again . 
  actually , it would have been better to post this on the 15th of april , but i think these series on r/europe will be over by then .

  megadraad / m\u00e9gasujet / megathread # dutch general election wednesday march , 15th 2017 # ( scroll down for live updates ) -- #election system ** cycle : ** every 4 years , unless cabinet `` collapses '' before ** voting system : ** party-list proportional representation ** apportionment method : ** d'hondt method ( slightly favours larger parties ) ** total number of seats : ** 150 ** electoral threshold : ** none ( technically 1/150 ^ th of the votes , ~ 0.67 % , around 70.000 votes considering previous election turnouts ) ** short summary : ** the netherlands has a multi-party system , with numerous parties , in which usually no one party ever secures an overall majority of votes , so that several parties must cooperate to form a coalition government . 
  contrary to popular belief , the largest party does not always deliver the prime minister , nor does it have to take part in the coalition . 
  two weeks after the elections , the new parliament will be installed in the lower house * ( tweede kamer der staten-generaal ) * . 
  coalition formation can take much longer . 
  parties that will try to form a coalition , will hash out a draft coalition agreement or regeerakkoord . 
  ideally a cabinet should be chosen from parties which together form a majority ( 76 seats ) in the house , in order to pass legislation efficiently . 
  a record number of 28 parties will take part in the general elections this year , which has not occurred anymore since 1933 .
