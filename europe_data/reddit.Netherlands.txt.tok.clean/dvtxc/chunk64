  - minor parties without a seat in the last parliament , but have a chance of getting seats this year : * ** denk ** * ( think / balance in turkish ) * multicultural / muslim immigrant populism * ** vnl | voor nederland ** * ( for the netherlands ) * anti-immigration , classical liberalism , euroscepticism * ** pp | piratenpartij ** * ( pirate party ) * digital pirate politics * ** fvd | forum voor democratie ** * ( forum for democracy ) * direct democracy , euroscepticism , intellectual populism - other parties : * ondernemerspartij , nieuwe wegen , de burgerbeweging , vrijzinnige partij , geenpeil , artikel1 , niet-stemmers , libertarische partij , lokaal in de kamer , jezus leeft , mens/basisinkomenpartij/vr , vrije democratische partij * - ** total number of parties : ** 28 - partial sources for party descriptions : [ * ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2017/01/the-main-dutch-political-parties/ ) -- # main topics * ** immigration and integration ** : in the light of the recent mediterranean refugee crisis , anti-immigration voices have strongly gained support in the netherlands . 
  the biggest anti-immigration party , the pvv , peaked at 25 % , corresponding to 38 seats , in the polls during 2015 and 2016 . 
  though the refugee crisis only partially explains the success of these parties . 
  the netherlands already saw the surge of more conservative right-wing political sounds in the 90s and 00s , before the economic crisis , the immigration influx across the mediterranean , and the recent terror attacks . 
  the recent events in rotterdam and increase in political tensions with turkey once again revealed that a significant part of the turkish community is still loyal to their country of origin . 
  the success of the pvv has caused some centre to centre-right parties harden their stances on integration as well to regain lost votes . 
  groenlinks is a notable exception in this debate , which has said that the netherlands have the capacity to host more refugees and should immidiately stop the eviction of asylum families , whose children have been brought up in the netherlands . 
  the pvda has expressed similar stances on the refugee capacity . 
  * ** morality and national values ** : this might sound as an unusual election topic . 
  with more parties toughening their stances on immigration , some parties addressed this topic to differentiate their voice , though the original stress arose from the pvv 's focus on the islamisation of the netherlands . 
  a large number of parties believes that many immigrants , including later generations , lack the support for liberal values the dutch have been famous for , such as women 's emancipation , freedom of religion , and acceptance of gay rights . 
  the vvd has taken this opportunity to formulate their campaign slogan ` act normal ' . 
  cda believes that the detoriated morality of the youth can be given a boost by reintroducing a military or social service . 
  even the labour party ( pvda ) has coined the term ` progressive patriotism ' in the context of fighting crime rates among youth with an immigrant background . 
  groenlinks has taken this opportunity to highlight the other side of this topic and said that the dutch have significantly lost moral values , because of the acceptance of immigrants foreign cultures has been in decline . 
  * ** healthcare funding ** : the netherlands saw a very radical change in the healthcare system , when the government abandoned collective short-term health insurance completely in 2006 . 
  since the introduction of the new healthcare system , the netherlands have risen in most healthcare system comparisons , but some parties indicate that the increased commercialisation has been at the cost of the accessibility to general healthcare . 
  a hot topic is the mandatory policy excess . 
  all insured persons aged 18 years and over pay an annual premium to their health insurer of around $ 1200 . 
  in addition , a policy excess of $ 385 is paid , in case specialised care is used in that year . 
  this policy excess has been called a * fine * for being sick by left parties , such as sp and groenlinks . 
  the vvd , d66 and cda want to keep this policy excess in place , although the cda would like to see a decrease in the amount . 
  the most drastic reform proposal comes from the sp , which wants a full reintroduction of the collective healthcare system . 
  * ** defence expenses ** : with donald trump remembering the nato member states to increase their military spendings , some parties have elevated this topic in their party programmes . 
  the netherlands have seen serious cuts in the military budget and currently currently spends less than the eu average on military , namely a mere 1.1 % of its gdp . 
  most parties want to increase the military spendings to 2 % of the gdp , with the notable exception being groenlinks , which objects any budget increase and would like to work towards an european common defence force instead . 
  the d66 stresses the necessity to cooperate on european level as well , but wants to see the spendings increased first . 
  * ** euthanasia regulation ** : the d66 recently caused some upstir by introducing a new euthanasia law , which makes it easier for people to voluntairy choose for euthanasia . 
  resistance comes mainly from the christian parties , cda , christenunie and sgp . 
  * ** weed deregulation/restriction ** : currently , weed carries a semi-legal status in the netherlands , which allows personal use but does not permit the sale . 
  the d66 hopes that introducing licenced marijuana production will remove the grey area between illegal cultivation and licenced cannabis cafes or coffee shops , where small amounts of marijuana can be bought for personal use . 
  christian parties oppose any further regulation of marijuana and would like to see a further restriction instead . 
  the vvd seems to be split on this topic . 
  * ** climate ** : the netherlands still have a very low share of renewable energy . 
  a mere 10 % comes from renewable energy sources , whereas the other 90 % comes from coal and natural gas sources . 
  since the netherlands posseses one of the biggest natural gas reserves of europe ( after russia and norway ) there has been little incentive to quicken the transition . 
  groenlinks , d66 , animal party and to lesser extent christenunie have prioritised climate measures in the part programme . 
  groenlinks has proposed to most radical changes to reach climate targets , including a consumption tax on plastic packages , meat and co2 emission . 
  their most controversial proposal , however , is the introduction of an extra road pricing surcharge , which charges car drivers per kilometer they drive . 
  the surcharge will be made location and time-dependent , with a price increase during rush hour . 
  the proposal faces heavy criticism from vvd and cda , which states that car drivers can not demand from their employers to avoid rush hour and that registration , road , and petrol taxes in the netherlands are already the most expensive in the eu after denmark . 
  the vvd stresses the insufficiency of the current dutch road network to handle the traffic load and plans to allocate extra funds for new infrastructure projects . 
  * ** european union ** : the strongest support for a stronger european cooperation comes from d66 , groenlinks , and vvd . 
  especially the d66 is known to favour a federal solution in the long term . 
  the eurosceptic pvv would like to see a nexit referendum instead , though anti-eu sentiments can be found on both sides of the political spectrum . 
  the sp is often considered to be hard-eurosceptic as well , just as the emerging fvd . 
  soft-eurosceptic sounds are found from christenunie and the animal party . 
  * ** education ** : until two years ago , all students attending higher education received a study grant ( * basisbeurs * ) in the netherlands . 
  due to austerity measures , this grant has been restricted ( * aanvullende studiebeurs * ) to those whose parents earn less . 
  furthermore , the price of a second study ( e.g. 
  second master ) has been raised from the regular tuition fee to a variable fee which can be set by the universities independently . 
  as a result , a second master can cost up to tens of thousands euros per year . 
  several parties would like to see a reintroduction of this general study grant , such as the cda . 
  d66 wants to lower the cost of a second study to the general tuition fee of around $ 2000 per year . 
  * ** retirement age ** : two parties ( 50plus and sp ) have brought this topic back on the agenda , as they want to lower the age of retirement back to 65 years . 
  currently , this age has been set on 67 . 
  * ** natural gas extraction ** : the underground of the province of groningen contains the largest gas field in europe and one of the largest in the world . 
  although the netherlands have profited from the gas extraction for a long time , it became apparent that the medal has a flipside a few decades ago . 
  the gas extraction has caused earthquakes and in a study conducted by groningen university , over 100.000 people 's homes have been damaged by these extraction related earthquakes . 
  so far , no government has taken the initiative to completely shut down the extraction , because of the depenendence of the dutch economy on the gas extraction profits .
