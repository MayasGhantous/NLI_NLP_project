  let 's say that our royal house [ has some history with the ss ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_bernhard_of_lippe-biesterfeld ), 
  yeah , we 're constantly fighting a new anschluss due to germany 's assiduous thrive for standardisation and streamlining their entire industry production line . 
  we just effectively make the trading one-way .

  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59797h/percentage_of_german_political_party_supporters/ the far-left has a bizarre obsession with russia and defends them anytime at any cost . 
  ironically currently , putin is actually more of far-right maniac , but that 's the irony many anarchist lunatics wo n't see . 
  i suggest you to reread my comment , the title and have a look at the direction of the arrow in the image . 
  do n't underestimate an enemy which has less to lose ... russia has an extensive history of sacrificing their own population in wars . 
  furthermore , they always can play the filthy game by getting their nukes out of the basements again . 
  current die linke supporters beg to differ . 
  i 'm not going to lie : this is truly an elaborate argumentation for taken stance . 
  far above some other recent mod actions . 
  take my upvote . 
  let 's see whether the mods will put a ** `` misleading '' ** flag on this thread as well . 
  -- independent : laws restricting refugees ' rights in sweden spark backlash as ** thousands ** take to the streets source ( local.se ) : ** hundreds ** protest swedish asylum laws furthermore , the majority of the demonstrators were a ~ ~ refugee ~ ~ immigrant themselves . 
  just an indication for the picture , which is n't stated in the article of the independent either . 
  -- furthermore , i want to restate what u/athaway13 ( +1118 ) said :  asking for proof of age and not letting economic migrants / `` refugees '' , real or not , stay in sweden forever = `` restricting their rights '' ? 
    no it fucking does n't . 
  everybody on planet earth is not entitled to go wherever they please no questions asked . 
  countries have the right to control their borders . 
  the netherlands having a different time zone than germany , while being heavily dependent on germany 's economy and therefore also their stock market ? 
  that 's never going to work . 
   and since every other post here is talking about food you seem be correct . 
  i almost spilled my coffee laughing while reading this phrase . 
  it 's a metaphor for a lot of other cultural elements as well ...

  i doubt a lot of redditors will take the effort to read this entire article . 
  ( i 've read it before it appeared here . ), 
  but this article , in my opinion , describes an underexposed , or not well explained and phrased , side-effect of certain minorities in european countries really well , without buying into an offensive style of writing . 
  it should be addressed and considered as an actually running process . 
  for example , if someone just shouts about _ islamisation _ in europe , he might as well be echoing stances , yet this article actually describes some recognisable creeping changes and a plausible working principle behind the creep . 
  on a sidenote , although i disagree with french being logically spelled with their silent syllables , i just love this phrase :  the victory [ itself ] has nothing to do with the prestige of france or the efforts of their civil servants in promoting their more or less beautiful latinized and logically spelled language over the orthographically confusing one of trans-channel meat-pie eaters .

  what if the lithuanian house of representatives has 5 seats ? 
  then they would just have doubled their number of seats .

  what emancipation ? 
  women belong in the kitchen !, 
  / s but a possible explanation is that if a woman works she will most likely work only part-time in the netherlands or have some other kind of flexible work contract . 
  men are more likely to work full-time . 
  part-time work is something typically dutch , i 've once heard . 
  i think they only counted the people with a job . 
  if they averaged over the entire population , the average for eastern european countries might have been lower .

  i would love to see the tears of the canadian trade minister at this moment . 
  because , honestly ... why does canada not want this agreement without isds ? 
  the thing about ttip and ceta i do n't understand is that the lobby groups suddenly are n't interested anymore if isds is left out of the agreement . 
  who needs electric cars if euro95 is only $ 1,42 on that picture ? 
  song stuck in head for the coming hour . 
  yes , the intersections oudenrijn and lunetten are basically just : `` fuck you peasant automobile drivers and enjoy your daily traffic jam '' . 
  to me that sounds like * bar-le-duc * . 
  which makes me thirsty . 
  the tl : dr ; of the dutch language : we were using ** germanic ** declension system , but the grammar was gradually being neglected . 
  then the war with spain came ( 16th century ) . 
  languages change rapidly during wars and after the war ( 17th century ) the upper class tried to clean up and proper up the language by introducing a ** latin ** declension system , because ... renaissance . 
  this just did n't work out . 
  as you can see , attempts to clean a language have ( partially ) failed in other countries as well . 
  good example is the cleaned up purified nynorsk , which is still forced by quotas on norwegian state television , and the desperate riksm\u00e5l attempt , while the majority uses norsk bokm\u00e5l ( which includes the `` filthy danish impurities '' ), 
  you 'd be baffled . 
  we actually have a weird language . 
  we use consistently use cases , but we do n't learn them as such anymore and no-one knows where they come from . 
  school books are actually switching to the explanation in terms of '' * de * - words '' and '' * het * - words '' , while in reality dutch still has three genders . 
  ^ ( ^ which ^ in ^ 90 % ^ correspond ^ to ^ those ^ in ^ german , ^ but ^ let 's ^ not ^ admit ^ that ) * 's middags * ( genitive of time masculine ) , * in de loop der tijd * ( genitive feminine ) , * middernacht * ( genitive feminine ) , * heer des huizes * ( genitive neutral ) , * wiens boek is dit ? 
  * ( genitive ) , * ten oosten * ( dative of place neutral ) , * ter zee * ( dative of place feminine ) , * bij dezen * ( dative of preposition ) , * den vaderland trouw * ( dative neutral ) , * zij * ( nominative ) , * hun * ( dative ) , * hen * ( accusative ) , * den koning ge\u00eberd * ( accusative masculine from anthem ),

  aww ... 
  i wanted to go next year . 
  am i still welcome ? 
   that 's just like in german . 
  #triggering intensifies ... 
  what 's up with the austrian women ? 
  yes , you 're right . 
  one remark : ** der ** is also used for feminine nouns . 
  see :  dag ** der ** vergelding ~ ~ though you would actually expect to have ** hertoges ** , because the genitive worked/works in pretty much the same way as it works in contemporary german . ~ ~ -- ** edit : ** linguistic off-topic sidenote : ah , wait . 
  some words have a slight different declension like ** des heren ** in dutch . 
  this could explain ** des hertogen ** . 
  it comes from the genitive construction which has become a little bit archaic in , at least colloquial , dutch language . 
  the full name of the town is * des hertogenbosch * ( the forest of the duke ~ ~ s ~ ~ ) . 
  that apostrophe just indicates the genitive article has been truncated/abbreviated over there . 
  just pronounce the * s * as being part of the name and without even bothering about that * h * . 
  the town has a short name as well * den bosch * , though there apparently exists an association that tries to promote the usage of the original name , which goes by the name of [ * het genootschap ter bevordering van het gebruik van de naam 's - hertogenbosch * ] ( http://s-hertogenboschalstublieft.nl ) . 
  cool , i think i also still want to see the * etla ... * no wait * eylatala . . fj\u00e6llaj\u00f6kuleyla ... fj\u00e6llajotklut . 
  that * eyla-dingsbums * that goes boom .
