  in the netherlands , reporting that your bike is stolen is just a formality if you have an insurance . 
  they just shred your report afterwards anyways . 
   that sounds disappointingly sober . 
  i am honestly sorry to have disappointed you lad ... 
  if you still want to hear more drunk speech , you 're still free to reoccupy our beaches next summer , as long as you order some drinks as well , for that extra vat-income . 
   exceeding the speed limit a tiny bit on your way to our beaches might speed up this whole process a lot in our advantage of course . 
  i know . 
  * ( non-subtle socially awkward reply mode off ) *, 
  no bouncing airbag this time ? 
  no , you just do n't have police . 
  if ireland had a police force , the irish football fans would be busy singing serenades for female cops every week . 
  no no , before he is driven off danish territory , the pesky swede shall be taxed for every litre of liquor he has in his car . 
  denmark 's efficient police strategy : just place some cops on that narrow border with germany and one transversely parked van at the \u00d8resundsbroen and let one police car chase the suspect throughout the country : sooner or later he ends up at the border . 
  ok , it 's literally _ vlees noch vis _ in dutch . 
  though i just did n't know the english one , and statistically speaking the chances are higher that it will be understood in german here . 
  mountain bikes are terribly expensive over here ( [ well , bikes in general are over here ] ( http://daskapital.nl/images/other/averageprice.png ) ) but there 's also no need for those , due to the lack of any height profile . 
   austrian netherlands that contradiction in height profile . 
  we made a mistake over there . 
  i mean : we could have had carnival in the entire netherlands . 
  how to distinguish the german from the dutch : _ scheveningen scheveningen scheveningen !!, 
   agile political decisions i think the netherlands might be an exemption to this list of small nation states , as the dutch politics are known ( or used to be known ) to be dreary in finding a political consensus . 
  we call it _ polderpolitiek _ , which even has become a verb _ polderen _ , loosely describing the process of finding a political consensus in which neither party 's policies are actually fully represented . 
  although the coalitions we 've had in the past decades consisted of relatively small number of parties ( yes a 2 or 3 party coalition is small if you look at the periods in which we had 4 of 5 parties trying to form a majority coalition ) , the bicameral legislative construction in which the party representation usually differs a lot , still forces the ruling parties to find much consensus . 
  especially the current left-right coalition tends to be _ weder fleisch noch fisch _ as economically they are on the far end of the spectrum , yet they though it would be a good idea to start a coalition together . 
  and when you 're done cycling on our bicycle highways , you will have to [ park your bicycle underground ] ( https://youtu.be/uuhlv1an0be?t=74 ) oh and btw , notice almost no-one wears a helmet . 
  ( which in my very honest humble opinion is stupid , yes ) but helmets have almost become redundant due to this biking infrastructure . 
  people will almost look weird at you if you bike with a helmet here , thinking you 're trying to imitate pro-cyclists on a lousy bike . 
  yeah , we can fix that , ca n't we flanders ? 
  i had to read papers for today . 
  why use . doc ? 
  use . tex  and non-editable documents and forms should be in pdf format by default . 
  it would be a shame ... if someone chopped down * alto adige * .

  you know those minorities living on that clay of you . 
  do you mind if they get a referendum over there ? 
  could you help me on that ? 
  i 've heard you 're kinda good at holding referenda , are n't you comrade ? 
  but i thought the tax for non-believers was higher than the normal tax . 
  which in quite a lot of cases could be equal to being punishable for being an [ accessory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accessory ) of a criminal act or [ aiding and abetting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aiding_and_abetting ) a criminal or terrorist act , in case this accessory has a priori knowledge of the criminal act , but refuses to counteract as he permits the deed . 
  in some cases the accessory does n't need to be involved in the preparation or the carrying out of the act it self . 
   vermeesch i had a glimpse of hope that * vandermeersch * had taken the red pill , before i realised i misread the name . 
  i knew swedes and danes like to trigger each other .

  / s by the way , the netherlands has a high ex - and import imbalance as well . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_current_account_balance when it 's calculated relatively as percentage of gdp , it 's even higher than germany 's trading balance . 
  i do n't understand why it should be a bad thing per se . 
  we somehow have managed to keep up with the developing asian countries . 
  the only downside is that wages are kept a bit lower . 
  user flair checks out . 
  gladiator fight between the qatari supervisors ? 
  sometimes i ask myself what there is actually left after 5 years of civil war . 
  i bet they have even bombed the same rubble pile multiple times . 
  snow ? 
  what 's that ? 
  legend says that we had snow in the netherlands in the past . 
  if the result will be like the polls show now , it 's going to be crazy due to something different . 
  namely the fact that 5 parties will be needed to form a majority coalition . 
  apart from the * `` bigger '' * parties , there are so many shattered factions at this moment which have one or two seats , with even single issue parties like the * animal party * polling at 4 seats , the * seniors ' party * polling at around 6 seats . 
  which is a lot if you consider that we only have a total of 150 seats and no 5 % hurdle to overcome like in germany . 
  they aborted the abortion of women 's right on abortion . 
  i see ... 
   in my city native people are the minority in the schools right now ( only 40 % speak german as first language ) . 
  how do you think these numbers will look like in another 50 years of that mass immigration insanity ? 
  and people went insane when denmark introduced counter-diversity quota , actually to ensure a proper education ... how is one supposed to learn the native language properly at the most critical stage of development , if he is confronted with kids who speak broken danish ? 
  even shittier if you consider the past elective results . 
  the netherlands have been shifting rightwards since the start of the 2000s , which makes the very title of this article false . . 
  the success and at the same time the death of pim fortuyn in 2001 created the space right to the preceding traditional right-wing parties such as the * vvd * . 
  some parties were unsuccessful in using this potential , such as the short-lived * ton * , some of them , however , have converted this potential in an electoral success , such as the * pvv * . 
  we already had a relatively right-wing coalition in 2010-2012 , led by the * cda * and * vvd * ( albeit a minority coalition , depending on the support of the * pvv * ) , which could be compared to a certain extent to a coalition of the * cdu * and * fdp * in germany for example . 
  the current three biggest parties in the polls are actually the same ( though in bit different order , and collectively being less strong than they were in 2010 ) : https://www.allepeilingen.com/ ( * vvd * , * pvv * and * cda * again ) there is no sudden sharp right turn . 
  if one had been following the dutch politics a bit , he would know that the potential for right-wing parties has existed over here for quite some time already . 
  though , now the * labour party * shattered to pieces , there 's no unitary counter force from the left . 
  at the same time an overall process of polarisation can be seen as well , including the left-wing parties . 
  on the left we have a trudeau-like kid with the willkommenskultur of merkel , counteracted by the `` must block them all '' - guy on the right who happens to have the same hairdresser as trump . 
  furthermore , i absolutely do n't recognise this statement :  for the past 40 years , the netherlands have , with just two exceptions , followed the u.s. electorate : when the u.s. turned to the left or right in a presidential race , the dutch did the same . 
  they suddenly started to subtitle flemish programs on dutch television 2 years ago . 
  even programs like commissaris witse , in which they speak like the clearest flemish possible , are subtitled ... 
  it looks really stupid and it is more like closed captions for hearing impaired people ... 
  hungry can into anglophone very good . 
  looking at [ this graph ] ( https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/1600/1*qlaa4mnfunl9rlzckaxm9a.png ) it looks like in europe on average pedestrians are killed by cars 3 to 4 times more than in the netherlands . 
  do you guys buy your driving license ? 
  / s although i have to say that infrastructure is a lot different . 
  we try to separate bike paths , pedestrial sidewalk and roads as much as possible everywhere . 
  usually there is some barrier between the pedestrial sidewalk and road , instead of a narrow patch of grass as in most countries . 
  if it is n't possible we will even make a [ multilevel bike intersection ] ( http://icreatived.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/suspended-bicycle-roundabout-061.jpg ) for example .
