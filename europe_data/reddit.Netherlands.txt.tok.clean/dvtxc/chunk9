  * there is just this running joke over here that rutte , whilst being single , admires her and actually wants to be someone of importance . 
  lol , i guess there might be some germans that would n't mind flooding mvp at all . 
  [ dutch green mep on 18/05/2015 ] ( https://twitter.com/judithineuropa/status/600276891883417600 )  there is no single evidence that is fighters are entering europe by refugee boats . 
  ** it 's hysteria . 
  so ... if i interpret your reaction right , i should go short on all the stocks of the ftse to get rich by march 2017 ? 
  rutte is always forgotten . 
  rutte can not into g8 . 
  rutte can not into eu4-top . 
  and rutte can not into merkel . 
  reading this thread , i see dutch and germans from nrw bragging about how great it is to live in a densely populated area . 
  ^ ^ p.s. 
  : ^ ^ netherlands ^ ^ is ^ ^ denser . 
  half germany ? 
  i do n't know how you draw the border , but perhaps that tiny patch northwest of bremen will be the only victim . 
  and only cows and some ~ ~ funny dutch ~ ~ platduutsch speaking farmers live there . 
  i know , but i bet that person was thinking he smashed $ 800 with every hit , but it 's probably a lot less . 
  well , the loss for the iphone retailer wo n't be that much as people think . 
  those phones are n't meant for sale , so their worth is only a third of the actual retail price of the iphones , perhaps even less ... 
  you know what sucks ... we ca n't even properly build skyscrapers in half of the country due to the unstable soil . 
  imagine how the netherlands would have looked like if we could . 
  nevertheless , your roads act as an intermediate habituation , so the transition to the roads in wallonia is n't that much of a shock . 
  statistics indicate that iceland is harder . 
  as a dutchman i totally approve and confirm this post . 
  i 'm in for autonomous cars ** if ** manufacturers will also provide the option to switch the driving mode into the other direction , like an * off-line mode * . 
  plenty of car makers are already continuously uploading user stats and user information . 
  insurance companies love to know how your driving behaviour is and we have no idea how * anonymised * this data actually is , and who the * third parties * actually are . 
   then sent a remotely operated underwater robot , or rov , that went to the depth of 404 meters , or the length of its cord , but still did not hit the bottom . 
  404 , bottom not found, 
  if it ai n't broken , do n't fix it . 
  true gopniki . 
  that 's not the brrrrrrt sound . 
  there is only one [ brrrrrrt ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=brrrrrt&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj_79azu7lpahvpk8akhtt-c2oq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969 ) sound . 
  as soon as they fare better than drunk brittish in a paddle boat , i 'm totally supporting this technology . 
  though i think that stage is easily reached . 
  liechtenstein is ahead of istanbul ... wow . 
  for all the paypal-moneyzz, 
  i like [ brrrrrrrt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3byeovno0y ) more . 
  just try to imagine the cut-off of the warm gulfstream . 
  norway will freeze over the whole year . 
  just to stop norwegians shopping in sweden for imported liquor . 
  birds do n't care . 
  and yes , we spend millions to make islands for birds . 
  are the qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois just as inefficient and lazy as our walloons ? 
  probably the atlas mountains hold back most oceanic winds and particles in the air do n't get removed by water condensation and precipitation as it is so dry ... 
  you get to do the cinnamon challenge and try to swallow it . 
  i liked the map with australia in europe more . 
  let 's get the aussies in . 
  lol , so the mosquitos in your lakes and swamps will form an even bigger plague ? 
  i 'm totally in for nuclear . 
   but that might as well be related due to the fact i 've seen a working reactor a few times from the inside . 
  that blueish light is so hypnotic . 
  swamp countries unite !, 
  this is no taxi service . 
  get your umlauts right !, 
  no , unconsciously they try to connect the introduction of far-right hate crimes to normal right wing families . 
  there is no clear distinction in the article , as from a certain moment they only refer to * eltern mit rechter gesinnung * . 
  and it is certainly dangerous to state that far-right are amongst us in this way . 
  it will create even more distrust among the population . 
  the style of writing tries to boost a state of alertness among the people to look constantly for ` too tidy people ' , as the indicators of extremists are n't clear anymore . 
  try to state once that you should be alerted if a normal lad speaks with an arabic accent , yet does not show any evidence of being a religious maniac and you will be called a racist . 
  yet , this article can create a witch hunt on right wing people . 
  we should be alerted if someone truly expresses fanatic or extremists thoughts and not try to create a stereotypic profile one should constantly be looking for ... 
  experts were toasting with champagne the night before the brexit results were published . 
  you might be , but i 'm definitely * am nettesten * . 
  * they remain unnoticed first . 
  `` these parents are tidy and spontaneous . 
  they build personal relations and engage in a variety of social activities such as the parents ' council . 
  '' , according to sociologist k\u00f6tig . 
  * this phrase truly reminds me of how people in nazi germany were told to look for jews . 
  `` they stay unnoticed at first , but acquire all the powerful positions . '', 
  throughout the whole article these so-called ` experts ' express their jealousy of successful parents and about how deceiving nice people can be . 
  this whole article is a warning to stay away from nice blond , albeit a tad conservatively dressed children and their parents . 
  they just have n't started measuring their skull volumes and nose lengths yet ... * les extr\u00eames se touchent . 
  * radical leftists apparently liked the writing of the far right . 
  btw , the * amadeu antonio stiftung * is quite a shady institution , with shady funding as well . 
  if one looks to the left , he can see a * sinistris vagus * ( also known as the * sinistris errantis * in some other taxonomic classifications ) in its wild habitat . 
  this species is known for its self-devastating and extreme altruism , although somehow they have managed to survive so far , despite their awkward survival thrive . 
  no , because australia does n't have to negotiate with an ottoman maniac about the conditions of the deal . 
  holy . 
  take my upvote for stating it so beautifully . 
  this post makes me want to print it and give it to every wannabe hippie i know . 
  no wait , i want to print this post , frame it , hang it on my wall , print more copies and give it to every person with even the slightest inclination to become a linksversifte rebellious hippie i come across . 
  they ? 
  taking our jobs ? 
  the joke ... * and no , there were no kebab shop jobs for dutchies before , so they did n't * ** take ** * those *, 
   i 'm a bigger fan of nuclear energy . 
  as long as we do n't let the belgians take care of the maintenance , it shall be fine . 
  [ previous submission ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/53y18e/women_volunteers_in_calais_jungle_accused_of/ ) by / u/jimrosenz has been quietly set invisible by the mods : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=women+volunteers&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=day, 
   at least they are quiet and know when to shut up . 
  it took some time before they could switch off the repeat mode merkel was in . 
  because last post was removed due to lack of context , i added a when , what , where and why ( and even an how if you follow the links at the end of this post ) . 
  -- this video was released one week ago by the swedish charity organisation * individuell m\u00e4nniskohj\u00e4lp * ( im ) . 
  im is a development organisation fighting and exposing poverty and exclusion . 
  the organisation was founded in 1938 and is currently working in five regions and twelve countries worldwide . 
  the video marks the kick-off of a new project of the charity organisation , in which the organisation tries to take up the fight against xenophobia , but it also tries to redefine what it means to be ` swedish ' . 
  currently , the project is in it 's initial stage , trying to find ambassadors to empower the project . 
  the project page features some possibly controversial stances which depict the feature of sweden according to the initiators of the project :  there is no turning back . 
  sweden will never be what it was before . 
  it is an understanding of what the world actually looks like - that sweden is needed as a safe place for people who need refuge . 
  some yearn back to how it used to be .
