how is norway compared to the netherlands ? 
  i 'd imagine pretty much the same , but much much colder . 
  i agree -- i also find the definition of '' * wealth * '' very obscure ... 
  that is regional accent -- which differs from native accent . 
  so ... yes !, 
  what could possibly go wrong ... 
  alcohol is quite expensive in sweden , right ? 
  while i regard militaristic power as the highest kind in geopolitics , you severely underestimate economical powers . 
  i even think that this is shifting and economy is getting the upper hand . 
  quoting the top comment : ** war is changing and the type of conflict nato was designed for is n't the type of thing we 're likely to see . 
  ** conflicts are very subtle and covert with a plausible deniability . 
  many nations have little to no clue how to react . 
  if russia , china and india start working together -- as russia is now getting * forced * to ( which is not really in line with their interests , given their hostile history with china ) -- the usa and europe have no choice * but * to strengthen their collaboration . 
  usa as militaristic power and eu as economical -- together they also top the technological advancement ( r&d ) . 
  randstad is the entire area , the dots merely show the cities within the area of randstad . 
  from this point on , you are just confirming the stereotype . 
  still accurate . 
  i am more in the business world . 
  making germany our most important economic partner . 
  quoting our site : [ economically speaking , germany is ** extremely ** important to the netherlands . 
  it is ** by far ** the netherlands ' ** most important ** trading partner , in terms of both imports and exports . 
  the two countries work together often , for instance on economic stability and security . 
  ] ( http://www.government.nl/issues/international-relations/germany ) * the annual trade volume between the two countries is among the largest in the world * the netherlands is the largest investor in germany . 
  the bulk of dutch investments are in north rhine-westphalia ( 35 % of the total ) , followed by hesse , hamburg , bavaria and baden-w\u00fcrttemberg . 
  you just basically googled `` randstad '' and concluded that solely the coloured area is the randstad ? 
  it just the highlgihts the high density * of * the randstad . 
  [ this map is more accurate ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/randstad_population_bubbles_%28nl%29.svg/640px-randstad_population_bubbles_%28nl%29.svg.png ) -- connect the dots . 
  we just happen to lift at the same gym . 
  yeah almost all my clothes are from zara . 
  i believe that is in my hometown ( soest ) . 
  okay , now back to the reality . 
  in geopolitics -- the world is imperfect -- one has to be pragmatic about this . 
  for the people who could not be arsed to watch the 13 minute video clip of uncle chomsky , here is the crux : * russia does not trust the west ( nato ) for good reasons . 
  * russia will do everything to keep ukraine off western influences . 
  they wo n't back down . 
  no russian leader would accept it . 
  * chomsky , ukraine should be neutral . 
  * putin has aspergers & ratface edit : chomsky is generally highly critical towards us politics . 
  take his word with a grain of salt -- but his points remain . 
  --------------------- it is really interesting and a well known point that is often buried in the west . 
  watch the first minute of this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el_09mazzs8 interesting discussion point would be whether ukraine could remain neutral peacefully ... : /, 
   `` ** norway is a long country and sometimes we have people convicted in southern norway being incarcerated in northern norway . 
  the distance from oslo to the netherlands is shorter ** , '' he said . 
  edit : it is okay , if you go straight to the comments without actually reading the article . 
  but if you are actually going to comment regarding its content , read the fuck up twonk . 
  nongreek media source : http://www.wsj.com/articles/spanish-official-says-greece-seeking-third-bailout-1425310495?keywords=greece ( 1 hour ago published ), 
  indeed , we barely understand the belgians . 
  belgium , a panarchist society divided into two regions : vlaanderen and the ghetto . 
  yup and there goes all the tax money . 
  16 million ? 
  oh and lives ... also lives . 
   so , basically , for the imf it only matters if the contagion affects private banks , if the contagion affects other states and their tax payers , they do n't give a shit . 
  you 're quite ignorant when it comes to the economy and financial world huh ? 
  opinionated ignorant ignominious cynicism . 
  + ~ 18k euro tax free barrier . 
   that 's a very sad and defeatist attitude to have . 
  no , the very opposite my friend , it is a fantastic conclusion -- a hopeful one . 
  it suggests that homophobia is malleable not fixed and fatalistic . 
  i was joking too but unlike you , i am not willing to explain . 
  the reason it is n't listed is because they do n't fully notify their wage to begin with . 
  they suffer from a tax gap . 
  sounds like a transfer union . 
  smoking tends to do that . 
  cronyism is the word you are looking for ( perhaps also nepotism ) . 
  that is because the uk is a far more powerful nation that us . 
  they do not enjoy the same benefits we do . 
  a political union ) of eu is * de facto * centralising power , hence loss of sovereignty . 
  so * de facto * , it is asking the people whether they are willing to give up sovereignty to brussels . 
  `` pros and cons '' reference is just a big red herring . 
  danke , so many ignominious wank stain against germany and their politicians . 
  why do people here dislike sch\u00e4uble ? 
  is it simply because you disagree with his opinion ? 
   yeah , that was shitty phrasing on my part . 
  no i know what you meant , but that is just rather discussing the variables . 
   but as friedman explained it setting the nit@0 under the poverty line defeats the purpose of giving the poor enough to live on . 
  yeah i thought about that -- that could be a puzzle i should think about . 
  remember that in my view , the economy is heavily de-regulated . 
  there are no further benefits . 
  not working and building up a buffer is very risky -- there are no safety nets . 
  i am also concerned about other macro-economic aspects , like price elasticity and inflation -- but that is rather a practical issue . 
   it 's ironic really , here i am a socialist arguing that people who do n't even want to work should n't receive anything . 
  and here a capitalist who argues in favour of a basic income . 
  i assume that people are willing to work to get from an uncomfortable life to a comfortable ( above the threshold value ) . 
  living on the edge of poverty is undesirable to , let 's say 99,99 % of the population by my unscientific estimation . 
   my goal would n't be to make most people work , but to reach full employment . 
  okay , lets assume 5 % employment ( nash equilibrium ) for this nit idea . 
  first of all 3-5 % unemployment is fine and rather desirable for macro economic reasons of labour flexibility ( and competition ) . 
  but like you said , that would be optimistic judging redditors here , so it could easily be 25 % ... 
  but we could fine tune the variables of the nit idea . 
  so all in all , what do you think of this concept ? 
   til life is expensive in the netherlands . 
  student room rent is around 400 euro . 
  and that is only a room , so an entire apartment of 700 euro is not that far fetched in the non-large cities . 
   the problem in my opinion would be that either the control with a negative incentive is missing , or that if poverty line  nit the entire point would be missed . 
  what do you mean ? 
  the threshold is always above the poverty line anyway . 
  negative incentives do not make any sense . 
  the punishment is low income , and barely normal life . 
  it is an uncomfortable life to not work and only live from the basic income . 
  there are plenty of incentives to work .
