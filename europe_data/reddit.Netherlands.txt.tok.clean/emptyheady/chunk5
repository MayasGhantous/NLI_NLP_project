  they import twice as much as they export . 
  not having the high valued euro ( relative to the drachma ) is severely going to hurt them . 
  then you know who is going to vote no , 
  a true game theorist lover like v ( ca n't spell his name ;p ) would probably be prepared for this . 
   i do n't think they will go to drachma . 
  but no deal practically means default and going back to the drachma . 
  the damage is very limited towards the rest of the euro states -- greece 's economy is very small . 
  according to bloomberg business the usa feels absolutely nothing from this greek crisis -- hardly believe it affects them when greece falls back towards the drachma . 
  i do n't think that greece is going to leave the ez -- they will probably fall back on their drachma . 
  not all ez members ought to use the euro currency . 
  if people vote no -- what do you thin tsipras is going to do ... 
  i do n't follow the greek media -- in what way are they biased ? 
  towards `` yes '' or `` no '' ? 
  like germany did ? 
  i d\u00f6nt sink z\u00f2 . 
  what happens when it is winter ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.zeeuwseankers.nl/data/uploads/201401281652e7d23263076.jpg ) is another proof . 
  this is hardcore ( or speedcore ) -- not hardstyle . 
  he talks as if this is the first time greece is getting bailed out . 
  and ... [ tax evasion and political corruption exist in greece . 
  this is to the extent that tax evasion has been described by greek politicians as `` a national sport '' -- with up to $ 30 billion per year going uncollected . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_evasion_and_corruption_in_greece ) . 
  first of all , the eu creditors intervene because greece has economic problems -- not the other way around . 
  our intervention has not caused the greece economic problems . 
  get this causality straight . 
  whether we worsen it is disputable -- my personal opinion differs from the current deal . 
  from what i have heard from the interviews of dijsselbloem et al. 
  many are fairly convinced that greece 's state is seriously dysfunctional ( corruption , tax evasion and the swap scandal with goldman sachs ) . 
  this austerity programme is rather disciplinary -- it lowers greek standard of living to a more realistic level that reflects their state of economy -- but pushes for efficiency and back to a functional state . 
  greece heavily criticises the eu imperial tendencies on other eu nations for very sensible reasons.they feel like they lose sovereignty ( which they do ) and democracy -- while paradoxically one ca n't have it both ; it can not be democratic while keeping its sovereignty . 
  it is a trade off . 
  you can not ask for bail outs without any concession in sovereignty . 
  i am euro sceptic for the very reason how the eu et al treat greece at this moment . 
  sure , that will really encourage the rest of the world to engage and invest in the economy of greece . 
  greece is a small economy . 
  what leverage do you have on the rest of the eu, 
  they are both in nato, 
  damn southern countries -- in contrast to northern countries ; good weather , good food -- bad economy . 
  god , our eu gdp growth is pathetic ... but not surprising . 
  i am of the opinion that it depends on the type of labour . 
  the retirement age of ( stressful ) manual labour should be lower than white collar jobs . 
  after zlatan , my favourite swede . 
  because hitting rock bottom basically means grexit . 
  we try to avoid that . 
  if grexit --  then greece falls into deep deep poverty . 
   if you go through op 's posting history i have not even read his user name . 
  op 's history means fuck all to me . 
  op 's questions are interesting and if you are simply going to dismiss it , why bother to comment at all ? 
  sorry op , i have not really answered your question earlier on . 
  deflation is undesirable . 
  monetary policies fail to work as the interests rates hit bottom ( 0 % ) . 
  the economy slows down -- people earn less . 
  it become beneficial to * not * spend actually ( or at least spend less ) . 
  it contracts the economy and the debt burden enlarges . 
  in greek 's case , the government 's income by taxations lowers . 
  they have to spend less . 
  the fact that their spending has a huge influence in the economy , it contracts the economy even further . 
  the downwards spiral goes on from here , as you can imagine . 
  having no monetary sovereignty makes the situations really untenable and there is nothing greece can do but to default -- or get some monetary injections from somewhere else . 
  compelling argument, 
  it is not that easy when they share a currency with other nations . 
  * greece enjoys a high standard of living and very high human development index , ranking 29th in the world in 2013 . 
  however , the severe recession of recent years has seen gdp per capita fall from 94 % of the eu average in 2009 to 72 % in 2014 . 
  actual individual consumption ( aic ) per capita fell from 104 % of the eu average to 83 % during the same period . 
  their standard of living is dropping ( of course ) , as one expects with recession and austerity . 
  * greece 's export is : 33.8 b dollar * greece 's import is : 60.5 b dollar source : https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/grc/ ( beautiful site btw ) . 
  note they import almost twice as much as they export . 
  this lowers the currency value of the euro ( not by much , as it is a small economy ) -- though it is overvalued for greece 's standard . 
  this suggests that they can afford foreign products because they are in the euro , which would be too expensive would they have had the drachma . 
  netherlands and germany are export countries and they profit from the ( for them ) undervalued currency . 
  though , they are some negative consequences . 
  our labour and assets are also undervalued . 
  i am tired of this shite . 
  it is fine to disagree , but at least provide arguments instead of puerile rhetoric gobbledygook . 
  so your solution is no tax at all ? 
  i am rather confused mate . 
  political spectra : https://politicspoliticspolitics.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/cphpost3.png & https://politicspoliticspolitics.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/danish-spectrum4.png source : https://politicspoliticspolitics.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/the-danish-political-spectrum/ edit ( 2 ) : oh this one is actually easier : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_parties_in_denmark, 
  you know that there are different kind of corporate taxes and it would be practically impossible to implement what you just proposed ? 
  in the netherlands , it is the patent taxation . 
  in ireland and luxembourg , something different . 
  internally these taxations have a function ( fiscal policies ) -- externally they are being exploited by the big multinationals . 
  my greater worry is that multinationals * can * ( and do ) negotiate the tax rate with our fiscal officials -- this is legal fraud in my eyes . 
  i am also going to sleep . 
  this thread is about france and germany , but since you mentioned the netherlands in economic aspects , i feel it is relevant to link this : http://www.government.nl/issues/international-relations/germany, 
   i think we 're both talking about different sides of feminism here : you seem to be tackling the more abstract and philosophical sides of the movement , whilst i was more referring to the practical , everyday use of feminism . 
  spot on . 
  i went deep into feminism . 
  read all the [ topics ] ( http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-topics/ ) . 
  they put a lot of emphasis on equality so i read some of [ that ] ( http://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/s/sen80.pdf ) . 
  i read the book of steven pinker ( the bank slate ) -- read chapter gender probably 5 times now :p . i learnt about the * suffragette * and have huge respect for their courage . 
  1922 was a special year . 
  as i am very familiar with philosophical debates in ethics and politics , understanding feminism was an easy hobby . 
  moral movements could be divided into two aspects , the descriptive and normative premises . 
  a feminist could only hold the latter , but that is rather hollow and almost none does that . 
  if science portrays us the asymmetry in gender , what implications does it have on equality , fairness and justice ? 
  but , reading on i have to say , you are in my view awfully mistaken to say the following :  whether or not feminism manages to understand human nature is n't really relevant to most of the goals of the movement . 
  you have little to no idea how wrong this is . 
  i argue the very opposite , namely this is the very core debate that divides feminists and why feminism is so unpopular in society . 
  christina hoff sommers has -- for this reason -- introduced the term equity feminism and gender feminism . 
  i have argued -- as has pinker and wendy mcelroy -- that many feminists in practice -- while unaware -- actually promote or maintain the incidents of rape , sexism and injustice .
