  the argumentation is too long to copy paste here . 
  it boils down that most feminism could be dismissed and morally criticised with * argumentum ad ignorantiam * . 
  swinging your justice swords blindfolded causes harm . 
  very relevant quote from the book of pinker : * the difference between gender feminism and equity feminism accounts for the oft-reported paradox that most women do not consider themselves feminists ( about 70 percent in 1997 , up from about 60 percent a decade before ) , yet they agree with every major feminist position . 
  the explanation is simple : the word `` feminist '' is often associated with gender feminism , but the positions in the polls are those of equity feminism . 
  faced with these signs of slipping support , gender feminists have tried to stipulate that only they can be considered the true advocates of women 's rights . 
  christina hoff sommers tries to save feminism -- as it is slipping away -- by criticising it . 
  feminists denies that christina hoff sommers is a genuine feminists . 
  * for example , in 1992 gloria steinem said of paglia , `` her calling herself a feminist is sort of like a nazi saying they 're not anti-semitic . '' wendy mcelroy ( horrific rape victim and also feminists ) also criticises feminism , especially their rape culture . 
  * as the economist jennifer roback points out , `` once we observe that people sacrifice money income for other pleasurable things we can infer next to nothing by comparing the income of one person with another 's . '' what does this mean for the differences between men and women in high paying jobs ? 
  feminists simply ignore this problem . 
  understanding human nature is essential for all moral or political movements that wishes to make a difference in society . 
  there is an argument that this is so important , it is simply logically absurd to reject it . 
  pinker dedicated an entire chapter to this specific feminist point view ( chapter gender ) . 
  solution ? 
  the irony of this all is in order to save the remaining ( still relevant ) factual feminism , we need to criticise the awful non-factual feminism that lacks scientific understanding . 
  criticising feminism to save feminism . 
  it is what pinker , sommers , paglia , mcelroy and it is what i also do . 
  edit : and reddit does that on a more satirical level . 
  they are not delusional . 
  many feminists are . 
  i will just leave this here ... http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/18/us/harvard-chief-defends-his-talk-on-women.html, 
  yeah i should elaborate , sorry mate bit lazy today . 
  *  the majority of reddit has this weird idea that feminism is only focused around trigger-words , pronoun-fanaticism and neurotic man-hatred . 
  none of that is true anywhere outside of tumblr . 
  taking this with a grain of salt and being charitable ( or lazy ) -- echoes what i say ; reddit 's general view on feminism is not delusional . 
  but i can already hear you think ; `` but these are the minority ? 
  the noisy ones . '', 
  it does not render to delusion . 
  criticising the crazy ones is good -- i rarely hear it from the feminists themselves , except for some like : camille paglia , christina hoff sommers , wendy mcelroy . 
  furthermore , to the point where i wanted to go -- to go a step deeper ; i think that the main critique towards feminism -- whether one is aware of it or not -- is that it severely lacks scientific understanding of human nature ( see pinker and christina hoff sommers ) . 
  especially evolutionary psychology . 
  pinker argues that the entire discipline of psychology should just be evolutionary psychology ( in his book how the mind works ) . 
  contemporary feminism often despises ep and this leads to the irony i want to end this with , namely this renders those ( if not most ) feminists to being delusional . 
  -------------------------- i think that reddit 's view on feminism reflects this , but on a more superficial level . 
  some jokes and rhetoric , but i do not think that reddit hold delusional views on feminism . 
  examples of this is the wage gap & more standard deviation among men , leading to more variations and extreme --  more men top and bottom bla bla you know the drill . 
  * do n't even try the straw man card  .  *, 
  so , not delusional ... 
  this is fucking stupid . 
  by this reasoning , you could ascribe everything to grexit -- see chaos theory / / ripple effect . 
  we are talking about direct causes -- the chain of causation is infinite . 
  this is a well known graph . 
  the fact that austerity does not work ( in depression ) was not really a surprise . 
  but -- dijsselbloem also has a point . 
  it worked for ireland and other peripheries . 
  you mean it is rather delusional ? 
  nah not really . 
  which only echoes my point that politics can do very little when it comes to fertility rate . 
  i am also of the opinion that politics should never go into those personal stuff . 
  * if * they want to do that -- some radical conservatism shift ought to be made . 
   the cause of a grexit would cause germany more than 120 bln euros , france would lose 90 bln euros and spain would lose 50 bln euros . 
  120 +90 +50 = 260 costs could be 500 bln in total being generous . 
  source : yanis varoufakis . 
  i am sure he is very objective and has absolutely no incentive to exaggerate ... 
  it does not affect the usa that much . 
  i am more worried about the uk than greece . 
  uk leaving is a heaver blow . 
  without going in too much into detail , do you know how [ this ] ( http://www.yummymummyclub.ca/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/elastic-band.jpg?itok=s5zejzw8 ) works ? 
  why is it mind-boggling ? 
  11 trillion -- hahaha . 
  that is ~ ~ ~ 3 ~ ~ 2 trillion bigger than the entire economy of china . 
  might as well buy greece . 
  silly delusional rant . 
  the highest fertility rate are african countries . 
  one of the more capitalistic countries ( the usa ) with no ( mandated ) maternity leave have 1.9 fertility rate -- higher than avg . 
  europe . 
  usa : 1.9 uk : 1.9 france . 
  2.0 sweden 1.9 those are opposites when it comes to the politics basically . 
  no ( significant ) correlation . 
  not everybody ought to have children . 
  this is a non political issue . 
  greece 's economy ( and its debts ) are relatively small , the consequences wo n't be that bad . 
  that is the ~ ~ irony ~ ~ hypocrisy ... [ yanis varoufakis calls for end to ` toxic blame game ' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32113699 ), 
  i have listened to many interviews with varoufakis . 
  he keeps stating that we should have a convergent negotiation strategy , not a divergent one -- insinuating that greece has been doing the former , while the rest has been doing the latter . 
  this seems ironic if not hypocritical to me . 
  edit : to add , v has also told us to stop the * blame-game * ... : /, 
  yet ...  however , on saturday mr tsipras warned the greek people to prepare for a `` difficult compromise '' . 
  false , dijsselbloem and co. . have proposed and v rejected it outright without close counter proposals . 
  * vaffanculo *, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xi3iqhv9yo ( dutch ), 
  if the sample size is random , ~ 280 respondents would be enough for 95 % certainty and 5 % accuracy of an ** infinite ** population . 
  good point . 
  http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/education-index sweden is 12, 
  it 's ben van beurden not `` ben van buerden '', 
  he does not . 
  mark rutte ( vvd ) is more conservative than hollande and merkel . 
  i could see why the uk might think that their closest ally could be the netherlands . 
  and both are subsidised . 
  you have not really answered his question . 
  ah good spot , you 're right . 
  wsj saying the opposite : [ greece 's creditors reach consensus on deal proposal to athens ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/greeces-creditors-reach-consensus-on-proposal-to-athens-1433242935 ), 
  too many people are too focused on greece . 
  if greece is allowed to default and leave the euro , then the other southern countries ( including ireland ) will be on shaky grounds , assuming they wo n't get special treatment . 
  when greece leaves , the currency ( euro ) will rise , crippling the competitiveness of the remaining weak economies in the eu . 
  i fear the rest could follow sooner or later ...

  nah , the french are rarely cringy when it comes to art and music . 
  he is reading it haha,
