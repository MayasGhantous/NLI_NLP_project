and in the netherlands , for politicians and football hooligans . 
  excuse me , dear belgians , but how are you planning on solving the problem of an aging society ? 
  it 's a small country , so almost everything is destined for export . 
  for instance , we eat tomatoes from spain , while sending ours to germany . 
  oh neat , no idea it was hungarian !, 
  interesting . 
  is farmeron mainly targeting the us ? 
  because of this page : https://www.farmeron.com/about.aspx photomath is badass !, 
  i did n't know it 's croatian . 
  thanks !, 
  as for the netherlands , i 've got a few that i think are cool . 
  * [ 3dhubs ] ( http://www.3dhubs.com/ ) , local 3d printing services and printers ( basically \u00fcber or airbnb for 3d printing ) * [ blendle ] ( https://blendle.nl/ ) , basically itunes for journalism . 
  they just got funding from the ny times and german publishing powerhouse axel springer * [ peerby ] ( https://peerby.com/ ) , basically airbnb for sharing things close to you . 
  * [ yournalism ] ( http://yournalism.nl/ ) , crowdfunding for journalism * maybe [ shapeways ] ( http://www.shapeways.com/ ) , although i think that 's no longer a startup ... or dutch . 
  did i miss anything ? 
  since the 2009 henry handball i guess . 
  i used to live in between belgium and germany . 
  i know of several kids whose parents moved to belgium because of lower taxes . 
  nearly every capital : arrogance . 
  suck it , finland !, 
  perhaps we could finally be a republic again !, 
  the united netherlands has quite a ring to it , no ? 
  do n't go there , though . 
  from what i can tell , it 's terrible . 
  for tech stuff : https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/, 
  ideally : switzerland , norway , and iceland to join ; uk , denmark , sweden , czech republic , poland , hungary , slovakia , croatia , romania , bulgaria , latvia , and lithuania to start using the euro ; ukraine to apply for membership ; serbia in the process of getting membership . 
  plus a better defined common foreign policy , a unified financial system with fiscal control on a european level , a true single market with one copyright system . 
  realistically : more of the same but a bit better and a bit more unified . 
  i 'm surprised no dutch people have said belgium ( well , flanders , really ) yet . 
  especially growing up in dutch limburg , belgian limburg is pretty much the same as home . 
  thanks !, 
  paams ? 
  yeah , spending 50 or a 100 million after cutting 1 billion . 
  we 're supposed to shrink our budget to 1,15 % of gdp by 2017 . 
   anglophone club with honorary meatshield nations, 
  yeah the accent was n't really spot on , but i still thought it was funny . 
  the netherlands : health insurance premiums are expected to rise by about $ 10 per month this year , but / u/jhsnl explains why this is actually not a bad thing : http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/2f09af/kan_iemand_me_uitleggen_waarom_de_zorgpremie/ck4np8g ( dutch ) the netherlands to join nato rapid reaction force with britain , denmark , latvia , estonia and norway . 
  [ english article ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2014/08/the_netherlands_set_to_join_na.php ) / u/victorvan drew an excellent [ map of dutch stereotypes ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/2ept81/stereotypes_of_the_netherlands_oc_2000x2255/ ) and it went viral . 
  albert blokker is dutch , though . 
  so who makes this index and how ? 
  yeah , i think urban area is the most useful metric . 
  heh , i actually ca n't tell if you 're being sarcastic or not ... 
  please do n't make it out like it 's all just a bunch of foreigners who misunderstand our traditions !, 
  really ? 
  people actually went to the streets for this ? 
  what is this , a parade ? 
  good points . 
  but clearly their actions have influence outside of their own countries , especially in the context of the eu . 
  ( see my example above . ), 
  so is n't there a discrepancy ? 
  yeah , it 's not like we grow tons of flowers and tomatoes and have lots of cows and sheep walking around or anything . 
  would hurting the citizens of russia really improve the situation , though ? 
  we 're not swamp germans . 
  they 're dutch people with a weird accent !, 
  in the netherlands we were mostly claiming that they 're playing a dutch style of football . 
   / r/europe takes an article about the chinese military spying on european firms and turns it into a lets bitch about american festival . 
  are you in the right thread ? 
   since no dutch person has commented yet , their royal family is incredibly well liked , they 're a symbol of the nation that almost all the dutch are incredibly proud of . 
  there would have to be something really outrageous for them to change their minds . 
  i think it 's not so much that they 're popular , although they are -- what i think is the bigger reason is that they have n't done enough things that were shitty enough for people to dislike them , so most people do n't really care enough to abolish the monarchy . 
  i am very surprised rotterdam is so high on the list . 
  there are 5 freaking oil refineries there !, 
   also raw herring is lovely !, 
  said almost no one , ever . 
  in the netherlands , political parties agreed on the implementation of a loan system : students in tertiary education will now get loans instead of subsidized education ( in the form of grants ) .

  [ this is an english article about it ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2014/05/students_furious_as_agreement.php ) . 
  while the dutch one is 130km/h , a lot of roads actually have lower speed limits . 
  i 'd bet that most traffic is actually < 130km/h . 
  haha , cool . 
  how did they do that ? 
  is that even legal ? 
  please remember that in exit polls , people may not want to ` admit ' they voted for wilders . 
  how does something stagnate 1.4 % ? 
  source : walking outside anywhere in the netherlands . 
  right , i guess i read the question wrong , i meant it as in , no it 's not new * this year * , it 's new entirely . 
  no , it is not . 
  dutch people trust scandinavians more than themselves ... and apparently italy is the least trusted . 
  no problem . 
  are you really austrian ? 
  your dutch is excellent . 
  i 'm sorry to be a grammar nazi , but your post made me google it and now i want to share this with everyone . 
  i thought `` therefor '' looked kind of weird , but apparently it 's a correct word ( i always thought it was therefore ) . 
  however , in this context , you apparently mean `` therefore '' . 
  [ source ] ( https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/58616/what-is-the-difference-between-therefor-and-therefore ) . 
  so that must have been [ berlusconi ] ( http://media.economist.com/images/images-magazine/2011/06/11/ld/20110611_ldp001.jpg ) 's plan to eliminate the mafia all along -- just ruin the italian economy !, 
  that area has a large population of russian speakers . 
  to be perfectly honest i had never heard of the place before i started making this map . 
  haha , thank you !, 
  thanks !, 
  this was just a joke that came up last night after a few beers . 
  haha , or try doing something spontaneous with a dutch person . 
  `` oh yeah , we can go see a movie , i think i have an opening in my agenda three months from now . '', 
  wow , thank you very much . 
  author 's response : `` thank you , belgrade guy ! '', 
  oh , my bad . 
  i copied that part from someone else . 
  all i know for sure is that it calls at hs . 
  that 's odd . 
  i saw that train with my own eyes , at hs , last friday .
