  in the netherlands , all train tickets are always the same price . 
  the only discount you could get , is if you buy an off-peak-hours discount pass for $ 60 ( i think that 's how much it is , not 100 % sure ) . 
  this limits your travel to outside rush hour , but your tickets will be 40 % cheaper . 
  trains in the netherlands are expensive , too . 
  yay , privatisation . 
  i think it 's awesome that they stepped up and took responsibility to form an agreement instead of saying : `` wah , this is n't 100 % what we want ! '', 
  nope , poland 's economy is smaller . 
   most of the rest of the world calls chips we call crisps chips in dutch speaking countries . 
  they call them french fries because they 're `` frenched '' , which basically means to cut them au julienne like they do with carrots . 
  at least that 's where i think the term originated from . 
  i 'm gon na print out a report card , go there , and see how much candy and cash i can get !, 
  dominant , not dominate . 
  and no . 
  and europe was never a dominant world super power . 
  individual european countries , maybe . 
  when the pvv started , i thought it would be just like the lpf -- in that it would break up very fast . 
  i 'm actually surprised that there have n't been more people leaving or being kicked out of the party . 
  fewer . 
  sorry , i had to . 
  because it 's so big and there are so many people . 
  you 'd think they 'd have at least one red region . 
  not a single region in france ? 
  surprising . 
  [ modern stuff , too ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cerbimspsqw ) . 
  also , [ golden earring ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwqmkf7r7xg ) is probably the most well-known dutch band . 
  for the eurovision song contest ?!, 
  that 's got ta suck even worse than being evicted for something worthwhile . 
   but what i meant by that is that the world is entering a darker phase than when the eu started . 
  and i disagree with you . 
  my point is that the world is continually becoming a brighter place . 
  sure , there 's some turmoil now , but there 's always turmoil . 
  i was just clarifying what i thought vayl meant . 
  [ check out this ted talk ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violence.html ) . 
  pretty much every generation ever has thought that they were or would be on the brink of destruction . 
  you know , in the cold war they thought ( nuclear ) wwiii was imminent , before that it was the scare of communism and fascism , etc. 
  but throughout history , the world has almost always been improving . 
  individual countries might be , but a unified europe is n't . 
  though it could be a huge force to be reckoned with if it acted as one . 
  then again , would we need to ? 
  we already basically have such a thing in nato and that 's even bigger . 
   just like most spanish do n't speak all languages , most canadians do n't speak french and most british do n't speak scottish gaelic , obviously nobody would demand people to know all european languages . 
  but he 's saying at least the people who speak scottish gaelic speak english as well and the people who speak catalan speak spanish as well . 
  i do n't know if the french canadians speak english , though . 
   that was okay in the good times , but now the world is getting darker . 
  what ? 
  no it is n't . 
  i do believe he argued for the exact opposite -- regional planning . 
  could you post the source to this article ? 
  yeah , i would n't trust that article . 
  quoted in handelsblatt ? 
  that 's a german word . 
  plus no source or anything , either . 
  or just sexism !, 
  why is it sorted by males and not females or even average ? 
  20 \u00b0 c , sometimes 21 \u00b0 c, 
   by that logic , those who did n't vote for him but voted for someone else are n't responsible for what he did . 
  that 's just one reason why we should n't generalize an entire people by tis government . 
  i agree wholeheartedly . 
   so , about greece : why does everyone keep saying they 're nothig but uncivilized scum with child brains who ca n't even run a country ? 
  because they are , and any other `` humanitarian '' explaination can go fuck itself . 
  whoa man , that 's a lot further than i would take it . 
  they 're not scum or anything . 
  i just wanted to make the distinction that it 's not like they were n't living in a democracy . 
  my point was just that they voted for these people , it 's not like their government was oppressing them . 
  is n't a government a representation of the people ? 
  people elect the government based on what they stand for , right ? 
  italians voted in freaking ** berlusconi ** more than once . 
  do they deserve to be humiliated for that ? 
  well , maybe not every single one of them personally , but they ** voted for him ** . 
  so i did a bit of math with this data . 
  i took all that money that each country spent and put it in excel . 
  then i divided it by each country 's population and then i divided that by the number of years each country appears on that website , so that you get the amount of money spent or received per capita per year . 
  [ this is what came out ] ( http://gyazo.com/14df7c7d48f2797ee8ac3b116831c2ce ) . 
  now , the flaw obviously lies in the population size , since that 's not a constant . 
  but i think it 's still kinda interesting . 
  for instance , i did n't expect sweden to have paid ** that much ** or italy to have been a net spender at all , more than denmark , even !, 
  and on the receiving side , i 'm wowed by lithuania and ireland . 
  but yeah , greece . . been receiving the most money from the eu for 29 years . 
  they do n't sell plantains in regular grocery stores there ? 
  sweet , [ i posted it to r/pics ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/pbj1j/pictures_of_the_snow_and_cold_around_the_world/ ) . 
  while the us went through the enlightenment , they also had the [ great awakening ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_awakening ) which , in many ways , was like an ` undoing ' of the enlightenment . 
  if they do n't join the eu , i think i can expect a marriage proposal from my girlfriend . 
  i ca n't really tell if you 're being serious or not . . 
  hm , so you 're arguing that the euro is n't working , rather than the eu . 
  i 'm not sure you can say that the piigs countries being in recessions/depressions is the fault of ( just ) the euro and therefore it 's not working . 
  i think there were also ( many ) other reasons . 
  also , maybe you 're thinking too short-term . 
   it is n't working without it now . 
  says you . 
  meanwhile we 're not at war and we 're all pretty well-off . 
  which i think is the point of the eu , right ? 
   as we 've seen the one leads inevitably to the other , you join the euro , you enter a federal europe , whether you like it or not . 
  because there is a federal europe right now ? 
   let us not forget that within the current arrangement the uk has progressed over the last 30 years to a reversal of the situation where the `` typical '' french and german were considerably richer than the `` typical '' brit . 
  is that actually true ?
