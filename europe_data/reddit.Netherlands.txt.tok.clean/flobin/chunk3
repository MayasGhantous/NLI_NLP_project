  in the netherlands , it 's 200 grams of vegetables and 2 pieces of fruit ( * 2 ons groente , 2 stuks fruit * ) per day . 
  i think i usually manage to get this , but not always . 
  yeah , i only saw it on reddit , too . 
  i do n't even really follow dutch news all that well , but no dutch people had posted about the netherlands , so i thought i 'd chime in . 
  the netherlands : 1 . 
  [ robben scored the winning goal in the champions league ] ( http://i.minus.com/ifw43yru3ner6.gif ) . 
  [ the end of may has been super cold ] ( http://resme.me/3ujvls.jpg ) . 
  the whole [ `` sharia triangle '' thing ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1f1049/dutch_anxiety_over_sharia_triangle_police_nogo/ ) in the hague that was completely blown out of proportion . 
  did i miss anything ? 
  is that still true ? 
  most people i know have contracts . 
  wait , is n't greece considered a small economy ? 
  sounds like every eurovision act ever . 
  i do n't think you understood what an apostrophe is ... 
  sorry , i forgot about our flemish friends !, 
  ah , that would make sense . 
  i do n't think anyone ( except limburgers ) says appelsien though . 
  edit : clearly i was wrong . 
  i see people talking about cambridge , estonia , dublin , finland , sweden , etc. 
  whereas in the us , they 're all around the san francisco bay area . 
  really underlines the article 's point . 
  chicken and egg problem , though . 
  they see themselves as turks because of the antagonism / there is antagonism because they still see themselves as turks . 
  correlation does not imply causation though !, 
  the british took/bought/stole most of the cooler ones . 
  new amsterdam , for instance . 
  imagine if it had still been dutch-speaking !, 
  i 'm not sure if the others are seen in a particular way . 
  suriname 's been a source of great football players . 
  indonesia almost does n't seem like a colony , they 're so different from us . 
  however , there are plenty of indonesians ( moluccans ) in the netherlands and we are very grateful for their culinary contributions , as dutch food sucks . 
  oh and we * love * afrikaans because it sounds hilarious to us . 
  perhaps you could have posted an even lower quality and smaller picture . 
  because i can still make out some of the words . 
  okay , sorry to be a smartass , but that is a tiny picture !, 
  that 's okay . 
  they have their own awesome beers . 
  i would n't have minded so much . 
  the netherlands would get a lot of the ruhrgebiet . 
  we 'd be * so * rich !, 
  getting rid of hollanders and their crappy beers in favor of german ones ? 
  that does n't sound so bad ... 
  i disagree . 
  they do n't need to be stricter ( if anything , they should be less strict ) . 
  but my point was n't even about strictness . 
  they should be more efficient and work in our favour . 
  for instance , i think it should be much easier to come live and work here for ( highly ) skilled people . 
  and to think you did n't even qualify !, 
  this 'll probably get buried , but : 1 . 
  do n't equate nationality with ethnicity . 
  do n't just privatise and liberalise things because you think everything should be that way and also do n't just feel like everything should be nationalised either . 
  privatise and liberalise the things that benefit from it ( store opening hours for instance ) and vice versa ( maybe we should reconsider privatising the trains -- at least the way we did it is n't great ) . 
  hopefully 1 . would fix our dumb immigration laws . 
  erm , why ? 
  are they out to destroy us ? 
  so basically croatia gave up , because they had no other choice ? 
  [ why not put them all in one flag ? 
  ] ( http://oma.eu/projects/2001/eu-barcode ), 
  why are almost all of the financial and accounting executives women ? 
  since hungary eats more eggs than the entire us , i 'd say they do n't eat very many at all . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but have n't dutch police been using drones to try and find marijuana plantations for years already ? 
  based on how brabanders react to it , actually, 
  oh god , that song is so terrible !, 
  that 's true . 
  so the idea would be a couchsurfing community for / r/europe members exclusively ? 
  that 's pretty specific . 
   we could start a couch surfing community ( check couchsurfing.org ) for redditors wanting to travel the continent in a different ( and inexpensive ) way . 
  couch surfing is usually even more fun when you have things in common with your host/surfer , and reddit has a certain ... selection bias among its users , that could potentially be very successful . 
  it might also help some people connect more with other people who are having trouble doing that . 
  [ there already is one ] ( https://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=26199 ), 
  try telling them exactly this : `` sorry , ik spreek geen engels . '', 
  heh , good joke , and i do n't mean to be a buzzkill , but do n't you mean flood the polders ? 
  as canals already have water in them and you would n't march in a canal . 
  yeah but he wo n't be prince anymore !, 
  you mean koning pinteman !, 
  what happens to the countries currently inside there though ? 
  we 'd like to keep the antilles , or are you guys planning to take those from us , too ? 
  how come they do n't show the netherlands antilles ? 
  that goes for every newspaper . 
  the first part : `` european . '', 
  i would be fine with this if they re-introduce the regular amsterdam - brussels intercity . 
  i usually get off at mechelen and fyra does n't stop there at all . 
  first of all , that 's not actually true . 
  and people may speak english , but might prefer to speak ( well , write ) dutch . 
  second of all , to share interesting things that are in dutch . 
  sure there is . 
  it 's for everyone who speaks nederlands . 
  well , the coastal part of croatia just feels very mediterranean to me . 
  in terms of lifestyle , architecture , food , and nature -- although the latter is n't relevant as it does n't relate to culture . 
  plus , you know , istria was part of various italian kingdoms/republics for a very long time up until about 1947 i think . 
  there are still areas where over 50 % of the people speak italian . 
  almost correct , because i 'd say the croatian coast is more like southern europe than central europe . 
  possibly one of the most important italian books ever : [ i quattro libri dell ' architettura by andrea palladio ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i_quattro_libri_dell%27architettura ) . 
  also , [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_architectura ) , but i 'm not sure it counts . 
  yeah , my bad , i guess i should have included spinoza !, 
  children 's literature is literature , too !, 
  what kid did n't grow up with jip en janneke , or pluk van de petteflet ? 
  you mean hongerwinter ? 
  for the netherlands , as with other countries , it probably depends on what period of time you 're talking about . 
  for instance , in the middle ages , it was probably reynard the fox , although it 's a bit of a stretch to call that dutch .
