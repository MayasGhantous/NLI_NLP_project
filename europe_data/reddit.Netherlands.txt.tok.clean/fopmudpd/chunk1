i 've had those in istanbul but they were only 3 litres . 
  we split with 5 or 6 people so it kinda defeated the purpose since we still had to get new ones after each beer . 
  10 litres sound so much better !, 
   10l glass of beer i need to get to prague . 
  but how does a black man on a flight from liberia have a higher chance of having ebola than a white man on the same flight ? 
  they 're both coming from the same area ... 
  there are more black people infected because there are more black people than white people in the ebola area ... 
  yep , it 's still considered the city centre actually ... 
  not really :p, 
  quite dry actually . 
  contrary to popular belief , most of the people in zeeland live on the `` land '' part instead of in the `` zee '' ... 
  [ middelburg , the netherlands .

  romans south of the rhine . 
  germanic tribes north of it . 
  batavian rebellion in 69 ad where the batavian tribe clashed with the romans . 
  starting from the first half of the 3rd century most tribes are considered frankish tribes . 
  two types of franks ; the ones in the area that 's now the netherlands are the salian franks . 
  they started pushing the romans back to the south and basically held the area now known as flanders at the end of the roman period ( around like 400ad ) . 
  also there were the frisians up north but they resettled elsewhere around 300ad for some reason . 
  tl ; dr romans vs tribes, 
  the florida one looks like a villain 's palace from a 60 's james bond movie, 
  you 're absolutely right , i do too ... did n't really read the title too well it seems, 
  i 've never heard of those ( they sound northern ? 
  ) , the ones that i hear/use are `` gat '' ( hole , sometimes boerengat ( peasant 's hole ) ) , `` timboektoe '' ( timbuktu ; when talking about some place far away ) , `` verweggiestan '' ( `` far away-stan '' , also used for places far away ) , '' ( midden ) in de rimboe ( in [ the middle of ] the ` rimbu ' , used when describing a really remote place , usually in africa ) . 
  also `` midden in de polder '' is used a lot in my area , though it 's more descriptive ( `` in the middle of the polder '' ) . 
  reminds me of `` twelve months '' in estonian ... `` cocks taste good '', 
  ten cows to you , too !, 
  ^ ^ \\ ( dzi\u0119kuj\u0119 ^ ^ sounds ^ ^ like ^ ^ `` tien ^ ^ koeien '' ^ ^ in ^ ^ dutch , ^ ^ which ^ ^ means ^ ^ `` ten ^ ^ cows '' . 
  ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ together ^ ^ with ^ ^ `` piwo '' ^ ^ and ^ ^ `` na ^ ^ zdrowie '' ^ ^ the ^ ^ only ^ ^ polish ^ ^ i ^ ^ know ... ), 
  [ `` significantly '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kt6mfqhzvm ) the guy is some sort of language wizard . 
  which makes it a problem for the eu as a whole, 
  i know the difference between bulgaria and hungary , thank you . 
  but i used the example of hungary because i had a conversation about this exact issue with a hungarian guy recently . 
  he told me that out of 6 million financially active hungarians already 400.000 people left the country for work since joining the eu . 
  and i saw it for myself on the highway from budapest to vienna on a sunday afternoon : hungarians returning to austria in austrian cars after visiting their families for the weekend . 
  but you 're probably right by saying that the problem is more prevalent in bulgaria than hungary . 
  and countries like romania and hungary where all educated people leave because they get paid more abroad . 
  we have an [ actual mountain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_scenery ) in the netherlands now , actually !, 
  it 's on the other side of the world , though . 
  [ do n't worry , they got this !,

  the aquaducts ? 
  did n't think of it that way . 
  thanks for reminding me that i need some coffee . 
  of course not in a good way , otherwise it would n't be humiliating ... 
  time for ukraine to send troops to russia to protect ethnic ukranians , right ? 
  is it a bird ? 
  is it a plane ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ which ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ technically ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ plane the longest `` official '' dutch word ( which is in the van dale dictionary ) is meervoudigepersoonlijkheidsstoornis meaning multiple personality disorder . 
   the dots are colored based on how far removed they are from the actual country , with the most accurate responses in red and the least accurate ones in blue [ article ] ( http://m.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/04/07/the-less-americans-know-about-ukraines-location-the-more-they-want-u-s-to-intervene/ ), 
  did n't the colour represent how close they were ? 
  raki is delicious . 
  it 's sort of like ouzo ( but do n't tell any turks or greeks i said that ... ) , anise taste . 
  eat your heart out ... : http://uglybelgianhouses.tumblr.com/archive, 
  ah yes that 's true . 
  ic direct is n't high speed though ( top speed 160 km/h ) . 
  fyra would 've been 250 . 
  so if `` fyra '' was removed from the legend the map would be correct . 
  you forgot the thalys , which does go from amsterdam to paris ( via rotterdam , antwerp , brussels ) . 
  they share the same colour on the map , so it 's actually correct . 
  but yeah , fyra does n't really exist anymore . 
  i was in riga in february . 
  no other tourists around . 
  plus , there was snow , 
  [ probably this ] ( https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/53/drain_nl.png ), 
  old * er * than we were , 
  funny related story : in a bar in tallinn a shitfaced older estonian dude ( ~ 40 or so ) started talking to me and a few friends . 
  apparently he was a lawyer of some kind . 
  his english was terrible , him being blackout drunk made it even worse . 
  he bought us a few shots ( the most expensive shots they had in the bar ) and asked us questions like `` you go defend netherlands when russians come ? '', 
  and said `` you go invade belgium '' . 
  his third and final question was ( took him about a minute to phrase it ) : `` how deep drink water in netherlands ? '' . 
  after i could n't give a satisfactory answer he turned around and left the bar ( another dude called a cab for him , fortunately ) . 
  so yeah , that 's my uninteresting story about estonian water ... 
  i think he was referring to the typo in the title ... that being said , from what i remember malm\u00f6 is beautiful . 
  i was about 8 years old when i visited though . 
  really want to go to copenhagen and malm\u00f6 again !, 
  really want to see the turning torso ... 
  the only ones i got right : - english - dutch - german - yiddish - faroese the first three are not surprising since i speak all of those languages . 
  i remembered that yiddish has a lot of `` sh '' sounds so that 's why i had that one right . 
  faroese was surprisingly easy , probably because i know it well from the band t\u00fdr ( [ they sing in faroese mostly ] ( https://youtu.be/3zy60ygs81k?t=60 ) ) . 
  i 'm ashamed to say i switched afrikaans and west frisian somehow ... 
   i 'm classified as a meat popsicle the souvlakia have become self-aware !, 
  i think they 're in the wrong order : in image 10 they ask * if * it happened , in image 9 they ask * when * it happened ( if it happened at all ) . 
  * dutch ( native ) * english ( c2 - passed cpe exam in high school ) * german ( b1/b2 according to the high school final exam levels , but it 's more like steinkolendeutsch ) * french ( je suis une baguette-level ) * italian ( only food-related stuff , which is all you need , really ... ) so in practice : dutch , english and german . 
  the way he writes it makes it sound a little bit like flemish as well , so maybe / u/myoldacchad1bioupvts is from a border region ? 
  your german reads like i could 've written it ... ( a.k.a. 
  is that dialect ? 
  i love hopping on a random tram to see where it takes me . 
  lviv looks beautiful , will try to visit it some day !, 
  preferably cheese but restaurants and pubs usually give you crisps or salted peanuts . 
  well i do n't necessarily agree with the comment being downvoted without explanation . 
  but as i understand it - you 're referring to croatia as a nation still heavily influenced by a guy who was in power before the fall of yugoslavia ? 
  probably because todoroslavia does n't really exist ? 
  googling only leads to that guy 's comments on reddit ( [ mainly this one , where he explains the term ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2v5z4t/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_08022015/coj8031 ) ), 
  the difference between two languages is a function of the amount of alcohol consumed in a certain time frame, 
  what do you mean by unsourced ?
