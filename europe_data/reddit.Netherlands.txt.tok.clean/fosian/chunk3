  this is also what the council said today in their statement :  in the future , we hope to have the uk as a * close partner of the eu * and we look forward to the uk stating its intentions in this respect . 
  any agreement , which will be concluded with the uk as a third country , will have to be based on a balance of rights and obligations . 
  ** access to the single market requires acceptance of all four freedoms . 
  ** all i am saying is the position of the treaties which govern the single market , and the position of all of the individual heads of state , and the position of the european institutions , * about access to the single market * . 
  this ** requires ** the four freedoms . 
  in the margins of that , or , without access to the single market , anything is possible . 
  what is n't possible , is whatever boris johnson meant in his column , getting rid of eu law , getting rid of freedom of movement , yet somehow keeping all current rights . 
  i 'm not talking about attacking anything . 
  i 'm talking about enforcing the law : which means , ( since 1951 ) freedom of movement . 
  the four freedoms are fundamental to the single market , and they wo n't be budged upon . 
  in the margins of that , anything is possible . 
  yes , the uk is pretty magnificent , but i very much doubt boris johnson 's idea of getting rid of one of the four fundamental freedoms of the single market is going to happen , ever . 
  its been in the treaties for forever . 
  keep in mind , as well , that the financial industry * relies * on the single market - that provides 11.6 % of the uk government tax receipts . 
  tarrifs will hurt both ways , which is why there probably wo n't be many of those ( there are n't many with the us either ) , but free trade and the single market are two fundamentally different things . 
  hopefully . 
  multiple council members have said that treaty change is not necessary , that instead they 'll work with the lisbon treaty , and additionally ` finish ' the single market , for digital services and energy . 
  we 'll see in september - there are enough ideas whizzing around the various think tanks in brussels now . 
  true . 
  but on the other hand , he 's has n't actually answered anything on a scottish secession , and as we have seen with the brexit , the day after a referendum is a different world . 
  besides , he wo n't * really * be pm in two years time , will he ? 
  i mean ... no ? ^ please ? 
  yes , but his voters are n't in catalonia , and there 's a fair bit of anti-catalonian/united spain kind of thinking among his base . 
  so , not so much an idiot , as a politician representing his voters ( while enriching himself and his fellow-party members , it should be added ) . 
   they would ruin scotland before even allowing the possibility of even remotely hinting that it may be possible to talk about joining the eu after secession . 
  as far as i could tell from the video , he 's very specific about being categorically against scotland negotiating with the eu on a matter scotland has no competences to negotiate on . 
  that 's rather different from ruining scotland . 
  that 's very much a soundbite , but also the legal reality . 
  i typed this up for another redditor : he says , about scotland , in response to a question by a reporter , who asked that , given nicola sturgeon was talking to schultz and juncker , what spain 's position was regarding an independent scotland . 
  his reply is : ( 1 ) there are regions , autonomous communities in spain and other countries , who have their ` institutional space ' and ` competences relating to the eu ' , and with those competences many regional bodies are in brussels for various things . 
  ( 2 ) having said this , and ** specifically about the article 50 negotiations ** , scotland has * zero competences * to be negotiating on behalf of the united kingdom . 
  ( 3 ) as things are now , then , scotland would leave the eu along with the united kingdom , because they are part of the territory of the united kingdom . 
  ( 4 ) as for the rest , about independence , etc. . . he says that is a ** british internal matter ** and it is not up to him to speculate about that future . 
  i assume you mean the elmundo.es article ? 
  it was a bit light on details , so instead i listened to rajoy 's talk after the meeting this morning . 
  he says , about scotland , in response to a question by a reporter , who asked that , given nicola sturgeon was talking to schultz and juncker , what spain 's position was regarding an independent scotland . 
  his reply is : ( 1 ) there are regions , autonomous communities in spain and other countries , who have their ` institutional space ' and ` competences relating to the eu ' , and with those competences many regional bodies are in brussels for various things . 
  ( 2 ) having said this , and ** specifically about the article 50 negotiations ** , scotland has * zero competences * to be negotiating on behalf of the united kingdom . 
  ( 3 ) as things are now , then , scotland would leave the eu along with the united kingdom , because they are part of the territory of the united kingdom . 
  ( 4 ) as for the rest , about independence , etc. . . he says that is a british internal matter and it is not up to him to speculate about that future . 
  does that help ? 
  easy , they 're against eu - scotland talks , because scotland is not a sovereign country . 
  spain would not want the basque autonomous region negotiating with the eu , nor would the dutch want friesland to do so . 
  that is entirely different from being against scottish accession to the eu , * should they become independent according to the british constitutional and legal requirements . 
  * edit : rajoy says the same - `` very clear ** scotland does not have the competence ** to negotiate with the european union '' . 
  also , i was wondering how long he will remain pm mostly because the pp is laughably corrupt , yet completely unpunished by this , not because of any direct relevance to catalonian independence . 
  partido popular - the centre-right party headed by rajoy and now in government , and one of the two parties that have switched power between themselves since the dictatorship . 
  [ notable for being dogged by all kind of corruption scandals at all levels of government , with a quasi-official slush fund ( `` caja b '' ) in which bribes by construction companies in exchange for public contracts were distributed amongst its members . ], 
  what he also said is :  `` i want to be very clear ... scotland does not have the competence to negotiate with the european union . '' which means that if scotland should gain , according to the legal and constitutional requirements of the united kingdom , the competence to talk about eu membership , then he might not be so much against it . 
  the pp 's line to catalonia is that the entire spain needs to agree to changes , not just one region , because that 's what is stated in the spanish constitution . 
  a tight political knot the country 's been thrown into ... 
  he 's witty and funny , but he also believes in something - the very opposite of someone like johnson . 
  so what 's the chance that unidos podemos and rivera get together , and hash out a compromise with the psoe ? 
  c 's gets some things , podemos gets other things for their bases ? 
  or did c 's go full : podemos are dangerous chavistas ? 
  time will tell , i suppose . 
  i did see a headline on el pais that sanchez wo n't abstain , nor join a coalition with the pp and rajoy , so forming an actual government will be very hard . 
  however , as the belgians know : an acting government can do a lot . 
  i always celebrate europe day as well !, 
   i mean , it is a remarkable achievement , which has been lost in the psuedo-economic talk that politics has become . 
  i wonder how long he 'll be pm for ... 
  if it is done according to the constitutional requirements , then there is nothing wrong with separatism . 
  they 've always said that they will not oppose an independent scotland if that independence is achieved through legitimate means according to the british constitutional requirements . 
  which is code for : we 'll only let catalonia go if the entire spain agrees , not just catalonia . 
  the british politicians were playing a double game , [ pro-european on the continent , skeptics at home  ( https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/uk-politics-path-to-brexit-by-carl-bildt-2016-06 )  when british leaders crossed the english channel to europe , however , everything changed . 
  leaving their euroskepticism behind , they continued to deepen the uk 's role in europe . 
  when i was sweden 's foreign minister , i attended more than 130 meetings of the eu 's various ministerial councils , and i can honestly attest that the uk 's voice was among the most prominent in every one . 
   the truth is that the eu that has emerged over the last decade has been shaped in no small part by the uk . 
  progress on the single market has helped to boost competitiveness . 
  new free-trade agreements are giving european economies access to major markets around the world . 
  the achievement of a global climate agreement promises not just to protect the environment , but also to cement europe 's role as a leader in sustainability . 
  and enlargement has enhanced europe 's security substantially . 
   these are , by all reasonable standards , remarkable uk-led achievements . 
  but this was mostly a well-guarded secret back home . 
  and that is the failure that lies at the root of the calamity that is brexit . 
  that 's carl bildt , ex-prime and foreign minister of sweden . 
  [ here ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/europe-day/schuman-declaration/index_en.htm ) :  `` world peace can not be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it . '', 
   `` europe will not be made all at once , or according to a single plan . 
  it will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity . '', 
   `` the pooling of coal and steel production ... will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war , of which they have been the most constant victims . '', 
  more seriously , i fail to see how a group of smaller nations can possibly tackle international terrorism , an enormous ecological transition away from fossil fuels for climate change , a multi-polar world with massive trade blocs to the east and west , a refugee crisis , and a resurgent russia individually by themselves , without some form of transnational cooperation and solidarity . 
  pvv and fn - both popular in polls , anti-eu , and pushing the centre right parties more to the right . 
  difference is that the tories were also eurosceptic , the british had nostalgia for their empire , and had a europhobic tabloid press - none of this things are the case in the netherlands or france . 
  the breakup of the eu is hyperbole , but i do think that brexit will lead to a re-evaluation of the eu and how to sell it to a more sceptical public . 
  it did n't really start as an economic group - that was always , from day 1 ( 9 may 1950 ) a means to political unity and ever closer union . 
  pretty much : single market without freedom of movement is never going to happen . 
  what of course might happen is single market * with * freedom of movement , and i imagine there 's a lot of lobbying the tories now to make that a reality . 
  leave voters might find themselves a bit ... deceived ? 
  also , do n't worry about farage and the ep - he 's been doing that for years . 
  17 years , in fact , [ and not much else ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-nigel-farage-2.html ) . 
  746th in attendance in a body of 750 . 
  not only an ignorant assumption , but [ spectacularly so  ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/europe-leaders-crunch-talks-brexit-fallout )  cameron reportedly told the commission 's president , jean-claude juncker , at a 2014 g20 summit that he could win a referendum ** `` by a margin of 70 to 30 '' . 
  ** juncker replied that even luxembourg would not vote to stay in the eu by such a big majority , according to one eu diplomat . 
  if it 's any consolation : a lot of politics is messed up now . 
  my spanish friends are still in shock that after so much obvious corruption , as well as * fresh scandals that have come to light * since the last elections in december ( corruption in valencia around rita barbera ) , the pp managed to grow in size !, 
  and in the netherlands , which used to be known as ` beacon of progressiveness and tolerance ' , there 's been so much ugliness and racism these last few years around every november/december , with the annual zwarte piet discussion . 
  and of course , anti-immigration rhetoric with our geertje . 
  so - now the uk 's ugly side of politics is visible , but every nation has it . 
  yes , i know , but medical is ( at least , if the dea is n't looking ) . 
  recreational is in colorado - by ballot initiative , as well .
