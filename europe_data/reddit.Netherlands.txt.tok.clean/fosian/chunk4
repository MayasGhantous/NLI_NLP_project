  yes , and legalised cannabis as well . 
  you get the good , the bad and the ugly , and you somehow need a political culture with healthy debate and that takes it seriously . 
  no - the french and germans pushed ahead with the ecsc , and later the economic communities , which were very successful . 
  the dm was also quite strong , and one story is that the euro came about [ as the price of german reunification ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-price-of-unity-was-the-deutsche-mark-sacrificed-for-reunification-a-719940.html ) - that mitterand , nervous of a united germany , wanted to tie germany even closer to the rest of europe . 
  remember , the european project has never been solely about economics , but about unifying a warring continent , and tightly integrating the different countries with each other . 
  i 'm a bit confused . 
  the truth is that the uk ** did ** get a lot out of membership , and it 's also true that in the 60s the uk ** was ** called the ` poor man of europe ' , and petitioned many times to join the economic communities , but de gaulle kept vetoing them , because he felt the british economy was incompatible with the european ones . 
  in 1973 , de gaulle was dead and pompidou let the uk ( and others ) in . 
  that has nothing to do with the empire , or handing the same empire over to america . 
  economically , a lot has changed in the uk , and a lot of that is also due to its engagement with ` the continent ' . 
  no , not at all , because they live in the netherlands , feel ashamed of and betrayed by england and happen to have an irish grandparent , allowing them to apply for irish citizenship and hence eu citizenship . 
  or scottish , if they go through with independence ( which at this point , many in europe would welcome ) . 
  what a fantastic expression !, 
  before joining in 1973 , the uk was known as ` the poor man of europe ' . 
  they 've gotten a lot out of it . 
  52 % of those able * and willing * to vote then . 
  still , a huge turnout by any metric - us election usually get a turnout of about 55-60 % , this was higher . 
  and it was also more about the eurozone , and not about the entire eu . 
  note that they 're also not negotiations of the uk with the other 27 , but negotiations * between * the 27 member states about what to do with the uk . 
  article 50 :  1 . 
  any member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements . 
  a member state which decides to withdraw shall notify the european council of its intention . 
  in the light of the guidelines provided by the european council , the union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that state , setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal , taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union . 
  that agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with article 218 ( 3 ) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  ** it shall be concluded on behalf of the union by the council , acting by a qualified majority , after obtaining the consent of the european parliament . 
  the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or , failing that , two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2 , unless the european council , in agreement with the member state concerned , unanimously decides to extend this period . 
  for the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3 , ** the member of the european council or of the council representing the withdrawing member state shall not participate in the discussions of the european council or council or in decisions concerning it . 
  ** a qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with article 238 ( 3 ) ( b ) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  if a state which has withdrawn from the union asks to rejoin , its request shall be subject to the procedure referred to in article 49 . 
  during the tsipras speeches about dignity last year , a montenegran commenter made the following astute observation :  there is this simple balkan rule of good vs bad that has not failed me yet . 
   the guy who reminds you of your nation 's past glory , swears that you will never bend your knee , recalls your dignity and heroic acts , discovers ever bigger imf/illuminati/papacy conspiracies against your nation - ** that guy is always a crook . 
   it would be a diplomatic nightmare . 
  looks at brexit vote . 
  yeah , about diplomatic nightmares ... 
  how patriotic . 
  [ this article ] ( https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/gilbert-ramsay/we-can-only-contemplate-leaving-eu-because-its-miracles-have-become-banal-brexit ) gives a rather interesting perspective , arguing that the eu should n't be compared to nation-states , but to other supranational bodies like nafta . 
  with this in mind , it is vastly more democratic :  this , if it happens , will be tragic . 
  for all its faults -- which , though very real , are inherent to the grandeur of its virtues -- the european union is arguably the greatest thing human beings have ever achieved in the political sphere . 
  ...  whenever people criticise the european union for its many real , and its many imaginary faults , it is legitimate to ask ` as opposed to what ? ' . 
  this is n't to reiterate the tired challenge of the political centrist to any demand for radical change . 
  * after all , the european union is n't just the devil that we know . 
  it is the foothills of something truly new , something not quite like anything that has existed on earth before . 
  * more than that though , it is here now , at least in rough draft . 
  and what makes it radical is , in large measure , precisely the same as what makes it achingly dull . 
  ...  various memes are flying about to the effect that the eu is actually more democratic than the uk ( since the council of the european union is made of ministers from elected national governments , whereas the house of lords is unelected ) . 
  but perhaps these miss the point . 
  * compared to its obvious peers , the eu wins hands down . 
  where is the nafta parliament , for example ? 
  which specific political assembly exists to hold the wto to account ? 
  *  in the end , the eu is n't definitely one thing or the other , and the point is that it does n't have to be , because the future of human institutions does n't have to be defined by the categories of the past . 
  what the eu obviously is , is an attempt to impose ** some kind of political accountability on transnational trade and to build political community without violence . 
  ** and it is not just an attempt , but a real , concrete example -- the only one there is . 
  the european union , vastly , magnificently imperfect beast that it is , has made political miracles so ordinary that we too easily forget that they even exist . 
  you know , he actually says quite the opposite , that the clear democratic will of the english people must be respected , and that he is saddened by the hateful way in which the campaign ( s ) were run : outright lies on borders , the nhs , nazi-style propaganda demonising refugees , and spineless cowards for the remain side which refused to make a positive case for europe . 
  but never did he say that the business of democracy is terrible , or that the referendum result is any less valid . 
  there 's enough of that kind of scapegoating in dutch politics , and if the reactions to brexit are worth anything , the government is only talking about ` instability ' and ` markets ' , instead of any kind of substantive idea about the european project . 
  difference of course , is that we also have loudly pro-european parties as well , and in general a far more diverse political landscape with healthy debates . 
  i am very saddened ( first it was hilarious , then came the anger ) by the leave vote . 
  all the english i know feel betrayed by their country , or in some cases even by their own family . 
  but the responsibility for this tragedy lies with the ( 1 ) europhobic tabloid press , ( 2 ) spineless politicians and ( 3 ) opportunistic demagogues that wanted to gain in the polls , and ended up pushing leave on top . 
  and i very much doubt your optimism , that the leave vote will ` expose the corruption rife with national government ' . 
  farage et al have woken up a mob , and the mob does n't reason like that , they 'll just get angrier . 
  all the english people i know - living in the netherlands - feel betrayed by their own country , and are looking into acquiring irish or scottish nationalities . 
  two things : ( 1 ) if brexit proved anything , it 's that politics trumps trade - so i do n't understand where the confidence of farage et . 
  suddenly comes from , that the eu ` needs the uks trade , and therefore will cave ' . 
  we also have our own politics , the arrogance that only westminster counts is staggering . 
  ( 2 ) the british certainly had an enormous influence on eu law , behind the scenes , they were quite influential . 
  they just played a shell-game with their electorate :  when british leaders crossed the english channel to europe , however , everything changed . 
  ** leaving their euroskepticism behind , they continued to deepen the uk 's role in europe . 
  ** when i was sweden 's foreign minister , i attended more than 130 meetings of the eu 's various ministerial councils , and i can honestly attest that ** the uk 's voice was among the most prominent in every one . 
  **  the truth is that the eu that has emerged over the last decade has been shaped in no small part by the uk . 
  progress on the single market has helped to boost competitiveness . 
  new free-trade agreements are giving european economies access to major markets around the world . 
  the achievement of a global climate agreement promises not just to protect the environment , but also to cement europe 's role as a leader in sustainability . 
  and enlargement has enhanced europe 's security substantially . 
   these are , by all reasonable standards , remarkable uk-led achievements . 
  but ** this was mostly a well-guarded secret back home . 
  ** and that is the failure that lies at the root of the calamity that is brexit . 
  that 's carl bildt , ex-prime and foreign minister of sweden , [ writing about the uk 's contribution to europe . 
  ] ( https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/uk-politics-path-to-brexit-by-carl-bildt-2016-06 ), 
  interesting for me was that apparently the brits have been playing a double game for years now : [ pro-european in brussels , eurosceptic at home .

  front nationale will go into the second round , and then collapse as the ump and socialist voters band together . 
  le pen will not win the french presidential election . 
  additionally , in southern europe , eurosceptic parties are nowhere near majorities . 
  even the new podemos is pro-european , although they want european reform . 
  they 'll get an fta - they wo n't get the single market , unless they are willing to settle for a norway/swiss style relationship . 
  that means : ( 1 ) no say in eu law , most of which would still apply . 
  ( 2 ) free movement of persons , ( 3 ) contribution fees .
