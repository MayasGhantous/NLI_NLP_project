  shocking as it may be , the other eu countries are also democracies with their own politics . 
  there wo n't be any of the having-a-cake-and-eating-it-too that the leave campaign has been promising . 
  he literally never expected to , or wanted to win - instead , lose by a small margin , gain popularity , a bump in the polls , etc. . . now the entire leave camp is in disarray , labour split in two , cameron disgraced , and the only politician with a bit of gravitas is nicola sturgeon and the scottish nationalists . 
  and the [ leave voters ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/divided-britain-brexit-money-class-inequality-westminster ) will be left in the cold . 
  oops indeed . 
  why would you think that ? 
  the european parliament was far more recent than the postwar european project . 
  he was dutch resistance , went to the ecsc . 
   ironically , you 've done it again . 
  it went from stupid british voters , to voters confusing the uk and the eu , to a bunch of political opportunists masquerading as issues-based campaigners fooling those stupid voters . 
  and the common denominator there are stupid voters . 
  there are several reasons for their stupidity . 
  maybe i 'll be more reflective and empathetic when i 'm less angry ( in fact , i 'm pretty sure i will ) , but yes , i 'm angry . 
   let 's not get into appeals to emotion shall we ? 
  is n't that the crime you accuse the leave campaign of having committed ? 
  no , the crime of the leave campaign is campaigning on the big scary other , eu myths , lies , and racism . 
  emotions are involved , but crucially , so are , as you put it :  the wrong reasons they campaigned on the wrong problems , for the wrong reasons , with a terrible result that wo n't make their economic stagnation any better , and will affect the lives of many vulnerable people . 
  your thinking is akin to victim-blaming : oh , she got raped because of her mini-skirt , not the rapist . 
  yes , i suppose i am being illogically patriotic for the eu . 
  because it 's the greatest political project of the last few hundred years . 
  because my grandfather , tortured , beaten , starved almost to death by the germans , later went and worked in the council of ministers with those very same germans . 
  of course its imperfect - i 'm not denying the very real crises that it is facing , and which the * current generation of political leaders * ( not , as you suggest , the ** entire eu history pre-brexit ** ) is struggling to solve . 
  but what i am not doing is shifting the goalposts . 
  the plight of the english leavers has nothing to do with the institutional functioning of the eu , and the laughable ` deal ' that cameron got had nothing to do with this either . 
  discontent in england with their establishment is what is wrong . 
  an establishment which was content to use the eu as a scapegoat while at the same time hamstringing it . 
  arrogant , ** solution-less ** political opportunists have seized this discontent , agitated it some more , helped along by the tabloids , in order to gain a bump in the polls . 
  now those same demagogues are stuck with their pants down , hastily retracting what they said , and both the vulnerable and the very people that voted leave will pay the price . 
  pardon me for thinking that they are stupid : they have not , by any stretch , proved otherwise . 
   being incapable of understanding why other people do the things they do , or of considering their point of view , is pretty much arrogance . 
  it 's not about not understanding : you say yourself that they vote leave because things suck . 
  well , yes . 
  but the reasons why the things suck has nothing to do with eu membership . 
  which is why it 's stupid . 
   in that sense , fear of an unknown negative outcome is always better than accepting one that is certain . 
  you have two option : shoot yourself in the foot , or take an aspirin ( which is engaging in * real * deliberation and advocating real and positive solutions ) . 
  the leavers decided not to go for the aspirin , because of various reasons , and shot themselves in the foot . 
  now they 're getting drunk , and leaving the aspirin for the morning after , when they 'll also be dehydrated and their foot will have developed tetanus . 
  the ` markets ' are the least consequential thing about it : it 's that the very real crises we are faced with at this point in history , are impossible to solve within the confines of national borders . 
  i 'm not at all convinced by silly rhetoric about `` gilded chains '' and `` uk being finally free to chart its course '' . 
  that 's patriotic nonsense , that , at the end of the day , will be proven wrong . 
   if what you are saying is true : ` none of these can be solved with the eu or some other kind of european cooperation ' , why should uk voters ( or any voters anywhere ) wait for a decade or two while the eu tries to figure out how to structure itself to meet its needs ? 
  well , now they wo n't , eh ? 
  the eu wo n't blow itself up , there is too much history there , and maybe the only positive thing about this travesty is that it 's a wake-up call to the other european leaders to see britain drowning at sea in the sunset . 
  all because some arrogant political masterminds decided to be opportunists , agitate some discontent , and whip up some misguided fervour . 
  fervour which you , it seems , have fallen for . 
  quite the opposite about the euro :  we believe we urgently need to revive this spirit to carry the debate forward . 
  and it is the responsibility of our two countries to bilaterally proceed beyond that . 
  we have to acknowledge that the requirements of membership and the fiscal implications stemming from the common currency have been higher than one could have expected when the euro was founded . 
  ** we must therefore respect the wish of others to decide on their own when to join the euro . 
   not only is it an example of the arrogant idea that voters who voted leave are just stupid voters , but it also assumes that none of the problems of the eu written about repeatedly in the media and the sub ever happened . 
  yes , the leave voters are stupid . 
  and you yourself have said that they did n't vote leave because of the eu , but because things are n't rosy for them . 
  you might call that arrogant , but that 's just your political opinion . 
  `` standing up to the eu '' , as you put it , accomplishes nothing whatsoever . 
  secondly , although nobody denies the problems ( at least i do n't , and neither do the radical left who has actually tried to face down the eu , unlike this farcical nonsense in britain ) faced by the eu , none of these can be solved without the eu or some other kind of european cooperation . 
  which makes attempting to blow up the european project ( the wet dream of a lot of these leavers ) , again , stupid . 
  philip pullman 's view remains the most on-point : `` we had a headache , so we shot ourselves in the foot . 
  `` now we ca n't walk , and we still have a headache . '', 
  really ? 
  you ca n't take that seriously ? 
  yet somehow , that 's exactly the argument you bring up :  nobody ever thought that these might be the people left behind in english society -- the ones whose regions * lack meaningful work , have dim prospects , whose people live on benefits and are marginalised , and whom the ` amazing ' machine of capitalism has forgotten . 
  *  particularly , the eu referendum is a * symbolic * revolt against the powers of the status quo , even where it has racist overtones and * essentially blames the big ` other ' . 
  *  nobody seems to understand that * life in plenty of places in the uk was not rosy * , and the inability of the power structures and institutions to rectify this inequality created the space for this leave vote to grow . 
  no , nothing would have changed , not as long as there was a tory government that did n't care about them . 
  it also had nothing whatsoever to do with the eu , an internal political affair , to be solved by british politicians . 
  quoting philipp pullman -  `` we had a headache , and we shot ourselves in the foot . 
  now we ca n't walk , and we still have a headache . '', 
  they had a reason , yes . 
  it 's just that the connection between that reason and the vote is non-existent . 
  those people will still have dim prospects , still lack meaningful work , except now the wider economy is suffering and they lost all kinds of structural funds and infrastructure investment . 
  the number one priority is preventing contagion , nipping these demagogues in the bud in other eu states . 
  the sight of the uk markets crashing ( and now , barclays ) is a start , and i imagine that ( 1 ) the uk breaking up , ( 2 ) the uk joining the single market , with attendant contribution fees , free movement of people and relevant eu legislation , and ( 3 ) the slide to recession and social unrest if they do not join the single market will also serve . 
  the second is a democratisation of the eu - far too many self-serving politicians have taken credit for the good things , and blamed ` brussels ' for the bad ( while , as noted above , is bullocks because in the end a lot goes by consensus ) . 
  this needs to be visible , and there should be more emphasis on social programs ( like the economic community had , before thatcher ) the third is solving the north-south economic imbalances , facing a combative russia , dealing with instability with our neighbours in north africa and the middle east , refugees , and whatever shit history throws at us next . 
  the english people , not the british people . 
  ftfy . 
  how hard is it for people to understand that national representatives decide on eu legislation ? 
  both in the council of ministers , and in the european council ?? 
  donald tusk is a mediator , he facilitates discussions between cameron and all the other heads of state . 
  the commission has an important role as the european civil service , but in the end legislation is passed only when most member states agree . 
  that means cameron . 
  that means your civil service , which transposes eu directives ( and often makes them more burdensome out their own volition ) . 
  that means your ministers . 
  oh well ... enjoy brexit - quoting phillip pullman :  `` we had a headache , so we shot our foot off . 
  now we ca n't walk , and we still have the headache . '', 
  that is true , and credits to them . 
  but they did in the negotiations right after the december elections . 
  and a lot of the spanish i talked to were quite frustrated - they wanted to change the country , while podemos was playing party politics . 
  look , if you ask me , there 's nothing wrong with holding a catalan referendum . 
  gets them to shut up about it . 
  but if you promise the world as a progressive party , and then make a side issue a red line for coalition negotiations , do n't be surprised that a lot of people on the fence would bail . 
  edit : maybe it 's not completely clear : the referendum is n't insensible . 
  it 's insensible to erect that as an obstacle when you know damn well that other parties ( psoe in andalucia ) wo n't go for it . 
  the brexit referendum kind of beats the pp winning again and political stalemate when it comes to * laughing stock * . 
  belgium even took longer to form a government than iraq , has been called ' a failed state ' , yet the brexit referendum is even more laughable . 
  that said , wtf spain ?!, 
  i kind of get it , because podemos was boneheaded in the coalition negotiations , but still ... rajoy ? 
  who `` spoke to rita barbera , who assured him she was not guilty '' ?
