  so no , the government has not been replaced , just the president ( although if you 're from a more autocratic area of the world , like russia , i can see why you 'd think the two are the same ) . 
  and ukraine is not at war with it 's own citizens , it is at war with russia , who is n't even bothering to hide it anymore ( except when they are smuggling buk missiles back into their country after hitting a commercial jet and subsequently obstructing investigations ) . 
  yes , those things are true . 
  but what is also true is that he is currently placing himself out of the political machinery of the two major parties , which is an undeniable change . 
  it really is hard to tell these days , poe 's law and all ... 
  on brexit :  `` but as the currency depreciates and inflation will be the driving force that will lead to declining living standards . 
  it is going to take some time but when it does happen they 'll realise that they are earning less than before because wages wo n't rise as fast as the cost of living . '', 
  on trump :  `` obviously he will divide because he considers that he embodies the will of the people and therefore anybody who disagrees with him is not really part of the people . '', 
  itt : triggered right-wingers and american basement dwellers . 
  we wo n't get wilders in march , because he ca n't play nice with others and nobody will want to form a coalition with him . 
  no first-past-the-post , it 's glorious . 
   i read on the internet . 
  did you do some source criticism ? 
  i ca n't tell whether this is satire or not . 
  well , from today on , banana republic in the us is confirmed . 
  well , yes and no . 
  the president changed , the regime did n't . 
  please try to pay some attention . 
  and as for everything being ` fine ' , it 's still a corrupt kleptocracy that 's also in a war with the russian federation , so there 's that . 
  months and months , they 've only been saying that the single market ca n't be had without any responsibilities . 
  that 's not threatening , that 's the truth , and the message has finally gotten through it seems . 
  the independent has the shittiest titles , pure and utter clickbait . 
   what illusions ? 
  you , fortunately , seem to be well-informed and under no such illusions . 
  leaving the eu * does * mean leaving the single market , financial passporting and a return to customs at the border . 
  however , maybe you could inform your own political class ? 
  because when boorish johnson , a week or so after the vote , publishes a column stating that the british will continue to have access to many eu benefits , without any responsibilities or when he talks about the four freedoms as being negotiable , he is very much under a spell . 
  yes , indeed , and the regime in ukraine did n't change . 
  instead , there was a transition government and new elections . 
  the parliament and all of the institutions continued functioning . 
  this german fellow is just a fuckhead though . 
  and who are these ` leftists ' and ` commies ' you keep referring to ? 
  maybe you should take a deep breath and try some empiricism . 
  a lot of that ` christian land ' disagrees with being ` christian ' though . 
  what does your racial fantasy of the us have to do with a german fuckhead ? 
  id cards are actually very common in the netherlands , especially since you always have to carry some form of identification . 
  islamism is a dangerous internationalist ideology , not a culture . 
  those are not the only policy responses that are available , even if you want them to be . 
  yes - new arrivals are being shipped back according to the turkey deal . 
  frontex is active and there is a more effective policing of the external border . 
  failed asylum seekers are being deported , although this is difficult . 
  radicalisation is ** not ** inevitable , and i 'm rather baffled by this idea . 
  mass immigration is a paranoiac right-wing delusion . 
  radical imams are not a real problem , mostly theyre a symbol - radicalisation in prisons and on the internet is . 
  and people who recruit terrorists and indoctrinate them are absolutely being prosecuted . 
  what ** actually ** works , rather than just making sickfucks feel good about themselves , is intelligence work . 
  and that is working . 
  i did n't manage to reply earlier , but essentially : language learning , employment chances , a robust anti-discrimination policy , and agressive anti-radicalisation efforts , both with an eye on prevention and repression ( mostly through the intelligence services ) . 
  [ this is working ] ( https://www.scp.nl/nieuws/hoger_opleidingsniveau_migranten_leidt_amper_tot_betere_arbeidsmarktpositie ) - at all levels , dutch citizens with foreign parents ( from suriname , turkey , morocco and antillen ) are doing better than before , and a majority of the second generations identify themselves as primarily dutch . 
  those are from earlier migration waves , which were put into ghettoes as part of the dutch system of ` pillarisation ' . 
  now , there is a far more pro-active response , and at least for * syrian * refugees , this is effective . 
  you are lying when you say that nothing is being done about it , or that no one wants to do anything about it . 
  pfff ... 
  nothing !, 
  `` what has rome ever done for us ? '', 
  i mean , she could declare a state of emergency , then renew it five times , but will that change anything ? 
  no , staying the course is the most reasonable thing - working to integrate the refugees , process asylum seekers , deport migrants , and securing outer borders while continuing intelligence work . 
  anything else , any ` action ' for action 's sake , will be as empty as you find her words . 
  that 's true , its difficult to deport failed asylum seekers , and people fall through the cracks . 
  but that does n't mean it 's not happening , or things are n't changing . 
  the turkish deal , for example , basically closed off the balkan free-for-all , but you would n't notice this if you read the comments on this sub . 
  [ not quite true there ] ( http://mobile.reuters.com/article/iduskbn13c25s ) . 
  although more needs to be done , these things take time . 
  also , i 'm baffled that the police should ` keep track of all immigrants ' . 
  even the biochemist christian syrian whose 5 year old daughter i teach ? 
  surely the intelligence services should rather focus on radicalisation and actual extremists ? 
  and those are not limited to new arrivals , but are also homegrown . 
  difficult , yes , but possible . 
  the dutch model is also rather successful , combining traditional repressive measures with a system of ` wijkagenten ' and social services . 
  sadly , that is n't true . 
  religious fanaticism and extremist ideology can appeal to broader groups , unfortunately . 
  but certainly most of the perpetrators of is attacks in europe seem more motivated by a fascination with violence than any deep religious piety . 
  no , it seems to be supporting frontex to have a capable external border , deporting migrants that do not fit the refugee criteria , and intelligence work . 
  but whatever figments you want to spin for yourself , sure , whatever ... 
   we must continue discussing the refugee situation , and how our society and the countries around europe should react to the human disaster currently unfolding in syria . 
  how many people are we able to help , and where , and how , should we help them ? 
  this is a debate with many questions and seemingly few answers . 
  refusing to help the people standing right in front of us , needing care and assistance , corrupts our moral values and perceptions about decency and common humanity . 
  it is a dangerous path to choose . 
  it breeds a cynicism that may well poison the remnants of solidarity in denmark , and actually unravel the social fabric that some of our opponents , in a misguided way , are actually trying to protect . 
  right now , too many people are quietly looking on while our core values are being undermined , because defending them may prove too expensive in terms of public opinion . 
  i thought we were better than that . 
  really , i did . 
   the danish state church is protestant , and we call ourselves christians . 
  we tell our children the story about the good samaritan who did not turn his back . 
  we demand that immigrants in our country learn , and adopt , our danish values . 
  so how are they expected to understand that in denmark we punish people for compassion ? 
  why ? 
  first of all , that 's assuming he knows where his brother is , which is not a given . 
  second of all , torture ( which is what you 're advocating ) is provably ineffective at eliciting accurate information . 
  the german intelligence service should certainly interrogate this person , but this should be done in a professional manner that has results . 
  your car battery scenario would ( 1 ) not lead to accurate information , ( 2 ) but would probably make you feel better for some reason . 
  why you get a kick out of degrading and inhumane acts is anybody 's guess , but i suggest you go talk to a shrink or your local priest . 
  a democratic and accountable eu , based on parliamentary debate rather than back-room deals . 
  what do you want ? 
  why would you spread this nonsense ? 
  why is it dishonest - this is an absolutely serious question , please do answer ? 
  while i do n't understand people who want to have guns , it was apparently legal to have them ? 
  and `` there is no god but allah '' is an incredibly common islamic phrase , essentially meaning `` there is nothing worthy of worship except the lord '' . 
  in other words , there is no * specific * link between radical islamist terrorism and this religious expression ?
