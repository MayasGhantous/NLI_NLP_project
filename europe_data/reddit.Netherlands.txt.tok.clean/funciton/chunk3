  a quick look at his history makes me think it really is him . 
  i guess they could theoretically pull it off with a soyuz mission , although they might have to depressurize the whole orbiter , soyuz 4 style , and it would require some serious space acrobatics . 
  three backups is pretty common in space technology , replacing a clock would likely be more expensive than building and launching 4 new satellites . 
  brexit ... ... ... . . obviously . 
  we were talking about brexit the whole time , in case you did n't notice . 
  no , it 's indicative of a mindset to not spend time and money on helping a country out of a crisis that they caused themselves , when they 're perfectly capable of managing it themselves . 
  conclusion : people in the eu do n't want to give humanitarian aid to a first world country . 
  not sure what that 's got to do with punishment . 
  and then lose it again in a week . 
  the uk is not everybody else . 
  it 's a threat to their plans to annex them . 
  [ ftfy ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ghkos ) ^ ( still was too lazy to remove that text over the coast though ) ^ ( , also apologies for the jaggy edges , i threw a quick dilate filter over the dotted lines to remove them , but it left this behind ), 
  what 's the problem with calling nationalist anti-immigrant conservatives far-right ? 
  except nobody says that . 
  because what far-right eventually boils down to is ` us before them ' , whatever ` us ' and ` them ' may mean . 
  everyone is increasingly voting for it , and jews and gays are part of everyone . 
   do you think you could just restart you life elsewhere easily ? 
  not easily , no , but the longer you wait , the harder it gets . 
   or do you think you life would mainly be put on hold until you can go home and those issues fixed . 
  getting home , or rather what 's left of it , * if * anything is left of it , wo n't magically fix their issues . 
   also their lives are put on hold anyway , a life is not a fucking phonecall, 
  this is inaccurate . 
  in a proper dutch voting guide , all paths should lead to the party for the animals . 
  brexiteers seem to disagree, 
  do you really believe a lynch mob would care whether it does ? 
  things ca n't really get worse than [ hutspot ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zjbzmdwv2z8/vijs7j0qbsi/aaaaaaaafjw/q_-tljxlwmu/s400/img_9728.jpg ) . 
  i do n't understand the appeal of fake meat anyway . 
  there are plenty of tasty meat replacements that are not fake meat , so why pretend to eat something you do n't like ? 
  what we think about that book is irrelevant . 
  what matters is whether the russian government takes it seriously . 
  `` zuckerberg is an ass , and we wo n't be working with him again '' \\ - angelam, 
  why ca n't they ? 
  they already do censor posts that contain bigotry , racism or [ too much cleavage ] ( http://www.gelderlander.nl/regio/nijmegen-e-o/nijmegen/facebook-weigert-nieuwe-videoclip-ronnie-ruysdael-1.6465208 ) , so i do n't see why not . 
  i 'm honestly not quite sure about that . 
  directed by frank darabont, 
  what you believe is irrelevant to what someone else feels . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it 's exactly what he said . 
  would you want a sitting duck as prime minister ? 
  yes , lol , jokes on us, 
  so why should i vote for the party that promises a lot but wo n't do anything ? 
  so all people of an entire ethnicity should suffer because it 's better for you when a few of them are gone ? 
  that 's incredibly selfish . 
  yes , it 's pretty simple for the creator of the map , but not for the webbrowser . 
  it is hard to implement . 
  you 'd have to make guesses as to what representation of colors gives the best readability , which depends heavily on the content of the image . 
  what i got from this is that they built a giant merry-go-round . 
  in other news , scientists found a correlation between the number of beach visitors per day and the current weather , indicating that beach visitors are a major contributing factor to global warming . 
  yet they voted * for * it in the referendum . 
  yes , designated smoking rooms are allowed , so , like i said , it should be blue on the map, 
  this map is outdated , the netherlands should be blue . 
  the exemption of the ban for smaller pubs has been overthrown in court . 
  i 'm glad that this image is built up out of fsc certified pixels . 
  in my experience nobody knows what they 're going to vote until they filled in the stemwijzer one day before the election , even though its result will be respectfully ignored , because it always tells them to vote for the party for the animals . 
  edit : typo, 
  gfk 's definition of purchasing power is different from the rest of the world . 
   southeast asian islam tends to be more liberal and secular than mena islam tell that to the christians there . 
   rt claims [ eastern european country ] are nazi 's nothing new here . 
  slightly more liberal translation : `` i would n't stand a chance as a presidential candidate '', 
  note that this is the number of people that rated it 10 on a scale from 1 to 10 , where 10 means ` absolutely important ' . 
  i would n't have rated it at 10 , simply because there are more important things than democracy , such as healthcare and education . 
  universal declaration of human rights , article 21.1 :  everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country , directly or through freely chosen representatives . 
  1 year ago trump 's odds to win any election whatsoever were laughable . 
  this looks as if when two parties can not come to an agreement , they lock the doors and only unlock them when there 's only one winning party left . 
  not too different from how it would 've been under the usa 's rule . 
  in fact , cuba 's incarceration rate is lower than that of the usa . 
  make the netherlands slightly greater again !, 
  [ not quite accurate ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/lion_distribution.png ), 
   in batista times they have only 12 for all cuba well that 's not very surprising . 
  you do n't need many jails if criminals are n't prosecuted . 
  [ well it 's not exactly * new * zeeland , but does zeelandic flanders count ? 
   peat is used for both * turf * and * veen * in english in the context where * peat * translates to * veen * , * veen * refers to the decayed plant matter . 
  however in dutch , * veen * can also mean * peatland * , whereas in english , * peat * is never used as a synonym to * peatland * . 
  it would not be correct to translate * het veen bij de amstel * , where * veen * means * peatland * , to * the peat at the amstel * . 
  * mire * or * peatland * would be more accurate translations of * - veen * . 
  * peat * translates to * turf * . 
  except this name is more common than john johnson . 
  correct , they would prefer someone who would take measures to * solve * the issue , rather than someone who whines about it for the sake of drawing votes . 
  the cda wo n't want to be in a pvv coalition any time soon . 
  the last time they tried it it cost them half of their followers . 
  perhaps pvv , vvd , 50 + would be an option , but then they 're still 9 seats short according to the most favorable polls ( 30 , 26 , 11 according to peil.nl ) . 
  i do n't see how any other pvv coalition would work . 
  a bit of a clickbait title . 
  those two new scary euroskeptic parties are one-issue parties that address issues that are already addressed by other political parties , mainly the pvv . 
  as such , they do n't really have a lot of support . 
  i 'd be surprised if they got any seats at all . 
  especially that self-proclaimed `` most important intellectual of the netherlands '' . 
  as a side note , the 29 seats for the pvv is according to last week 's peil.nl polls by maurice de hond . 
  those polls are n't exactly known for their accuracy , and tend to favor the pvv . 
  20-25 is a more realistic number . 
  [ here ] ( http://frontbencher.nl/peilingen/ ) are some other , probably more accurate polls . 
  note that this article is about refugees that arrived since the start of 2015 . 
  i in fact like modern architecture . 
  it 's the 70s ' blocks of concrete that i do n't like . 
  [ why not both ? 
  ] ( http://defotograaf.eu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rotterdam4.jpg ), 
  you call it functionalism , i call it throwing down blocks of concrete wherever you can without giving a flying fuck about the end result . 
  human rights are not a subjective philosophy . 
  and 4 months in prison is not excessive ? 
  that worked out well in charlottesville,
