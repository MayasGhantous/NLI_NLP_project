  that is what discourse is , and it is healthy for the growth of movements if people continue debating and critically analyzing their own movement . 
  feminism is n't a monolith . 
  `` tumblr feminists '' barely even is a thing that matters in the greater framework of things . 
  it is insane that reddit focuses so much on a few adolescents and teenagers with blogs instead of the real deal . 
  the best way i 've heard it put is that a lot of `` tumblr feminists '' ( as far as you can even speak of such a group/movement ) are mostly teenagers that are exposed to complex sociological ideas without understanding the finesse and context of those ideas . 
  then , they apply their basic and grossly oversimplified understanding of these ideas in awkward and forced ways on their own writings , leading to the `` tumblr feminist '' . 
  i ca n't stress this enough by the way : the `` tumblr feminist '' does n't really exist in the way reddit thinks it does . 
  tumblr is a huge website , which is for 99 % non-social justice related blogs . 
  radical feminism is n't interchangeable with fringe feminism . 
  radical feminism is n't female supremacy or batshit insanity either ; that is how radical feminism is misrepresented by mras on reddit . 
  it would be inaccurate to say that radical feminism is negligible , because it is n't . 
  it is also inaccurate to say that radical feminism is female supremacy/fringe feminism , because it is n't . 
  liberal feminism : changing women 's positions through laws radical feminism : changing women 's positions through laws and through reshaping societal foundations regarding gender that 's it . 
  this is of course a simplification still , but it does the trick of explaining how `` radical feminism '' is a fixed expression and not a word denoting fringe ideas . 
  feminism gets a bad rap on reddit , but do n't believe the hype : the overwhelming majority of feminists are a positive force in our society . 
  feminism is n't female supremacy , as it is often misrepresented by many a redditor with an agenda . 
  because sweden offers them permanent citizenship , allowing them to build up a life instead of getting sent back after a few years . 
  i meant workplace protection . 
  i do not envy your two party system and deadlock which is dominated by unqualified weirdos . 
  it is a disgrace that a donald trump can hijack your elections so much for example . 
  also , there is so many laws in the u.s. still on the books that should have been repealed in the 1970s . 
  same goes for any country that is not iraq or syria . 
  i can hardly blame these people that , now that they are in the land of opportunity , they use our open borders to travel further . 
  that does indeed make them economical immigrants ; they are not terrible humans because of it . 
  also , the end result would be the same , if they 'd get citizenship in greece at one point they could migrate to any other european country after some years . 
  it appears you 're indeed more one suited to a sword with a sharp edge . 
  yeah , you would know , what with your perfectly oiled political and governmental machine . 
  the u.s. can barely agree on ending the discrimination of lgbt people , to name one of a few things where the u.s. lags behind . 
  you and your fearmongering are bizarre . 
  a couple of thousand of refugees hardly constitutes a great migration . 
  third world countries regularly deal with ** millions ** of refugees from neighboring countries . 
  `` blend in with the other refugees '' is n't really possible since they still have to prove , using documents , that they are from syria . 
  also , your username is a dead giveaway that you are doing the whole national socialist fearmongering thing . 
  and rules are also standardized agreements that have been made ** beforehand ** instead of on the fly . 
   is n't there a problem of swedish women getting gang raped by `` refugees '' ? 
  what the fuck is wrong with sweden ? 
  i see you 've read right-wing fearmongering . 
   there is nothing more pathetic than a wannabe good-two-shoes doing something solely to get a pat on the head ... sweden is doing this for humanitarian reasons , not to get `` a pat on the head '' from other countries . 
   assange did call sweden the ` saudi arabia of feminism ' for a reason . 
  that reason being that assange is a rapist . 
   have n't you seen the pictures of people from libya to iraq holding pictures of merkel and chanting her name ? 
  please post them . 
  your username gives your agenda away . 
   in dutch ( which is pretty much low german ) kom vechten dan . 
  you guys have a specific word for `` even the siren '' ? 
  how often do you use it ? 
  the word you are looking for is transitional . 
  iirc , transit has to do with traffic . 
  except that we can just close the borders if we want . 
  we 're not obliged to host refugees . 
  actually , if you read the article , it says that a whopping 96 % think there are enough refugees . 
  66 % think there are already too many . 
  ethiopia is also a magnificently beautiful country , yet poor as dirt and a shithole in many many ways . 
  it 's unrelated to landscape . 
   problem is that anyone who does n't agree with their politics is , according to them , a ` troll full of hatred ' . 
  which is a rhetorically terrible way to build consensus , as it drives voters away from them even further . 
  no one likes to be insulted . 
  development is not one to one connected to age . 
  some people take longer to reach certain developmental stages than others . 
  unless you have a birth certificate , it is impossible to prove his real age . 
  i gather she does it as her job and not as a volunteer . 
  most people ca n't just leave the financial security of their job all of a sudden . 
   the greek crisis is still going on yes , but without new developments . 
  the situation is stagnant . 
  for the refugee crisis , it is likely that new developments will keep occuring as it is an important and immediate issue for most european governments . 
   the ukraine crisis still continues it is a de facto stalemate . 
  no real conflict has occured for months now . 
  because a little more than half of the refugees are not from war zones , mostly countries like morocco , algeria , tunisia , egypt , pakistan , iran , ghana and nigeria . 
  ( although for the last one there is a case to be made that northeast nigeria is an active warzone ) . 
  the third world is not going to get magically super rich anytime soon ( sadly enough ) , so this refugee crisis is not going to stop anytime soon either . 
  there is even a theory that this will only increase because most of these people are leaving countries whose economies are hit by climate change-caused turmoil . 
  the migrant crisis will not dissappear from the news anytime soon . 
  it 's been in the new for months now and there is a precedent for news stories that take up front pages for years on end , such as the syrian civil war . 
  the migrant crisis is the most important problem that europe faces in the coming years . 
  do n't forget that korfbal is mixed gender by design , as teams consist of four men and four women . 
  are there any statistics on the literacy and education rates of them ? 
  you know what i mean . 
  do n't be obtuse . 
  i do n't think you can trust official figures in russia . 
  actually , the hierarchy of needs dictates that those kind of refugees are too busy with trying to not get shot or starve to actively care about pressuring aid workers for a shiny new car or sexually harass people . 
  no , the question is : ` is there a purpose or not ? ', 
  humans often falsely think that everything or at least most of the things that happen must have a purpose and that everything can be explained using logical axioms . 
  in reality , most of us have no idea what is happening most of the time , and that adage holds true for our rulers too - an angela merkel probably thinks she is doing the morally right thing , does n't really know what the refugees are really like , and neither does the common man . 
  it is a much scarier thought also , that there is no master plan , no purpose , no people pulling the strings of some sort of macabre puppetry play . 
  we 're all just a couple of billion mostly hairless primates hurling about through space on a big-ass piece of rock , and in the end stuff just happens for no particular reason or purpose . 
  millions of poor people from outside the eu apparently want a shiny nice car and a mcmansion , and now we 've a problem on our hand that was n't caused by anyone in particular . 
  that should n't even be that surprising . 
  the culture of a country is defined by the values of the majority of the people in that country . 
  if a country has a culture that is misogynist , it seems obvious that the majority of that country 's inhabitants then subscribe to misogynist values , right ? 
  you do n't solve global poverty by moving all the world 's poor to rich western countries . 
  ignoring the difficulty of integration and the cultural incompabilities for a moment : if the world 's poor move to the western world en masse , western economies will collapse , and then we have only increased the problem even more . 
  so this woman , who testifies of the horrible experiences she has had , is completely irredeemable because she realized later than you did that many refugees are misogynist ? 
  she is n't allowed to change her viewpoints and you 're going to hold it against her that she was once naive about this whole affair ? 
  millions of people are part of the `` refugees welcome '' crowd out of naivety , not malice . 
  the average citizen knows little to nothing about this all - she was just initially under the impression that she was doing the right and moral thing , and it testifies of her sanity that she has changed her viewpoints after witnessing what the refugee centres were really like . 
  it actually contrasts nicely with your ideological rigidity , the harshness with which you view this woman . 
  i dislike all religion , but the religion threatening humanism the most is islam . 
  it has a power to corrupt young children like this , a power that has n't been seen on such a large scale in christianity for over a century . 
  i also have grown disillusioned with the concept of a ` moderate ' islam - the basic fundamentals of islam are already at odds with humanism , so a truly ` moderate islam ' would n't really be islam anymore . 
  there are british stag parties in krakow ?
