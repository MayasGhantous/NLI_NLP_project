  i thought that horrible phenomena was confined to just amsterdam . 
  my condolences . 
  what is that amorphous blob in the photo of birmingham ? 
  i definitely like the jews , i just do n't like the israeli government . 
  bro have you taken a look at the gobbledigook ** you ** speak ? 
  iwgoslafaidd seems to be ` yugoslavian ' in welsh indeed . 
  what a wild ride it has been . 
  there were , uh , some growing pains , but in the end it turned out to be a pretty alright nation . 
  no , you got that wrong , it 's spelled * hamburg * . 
  is that the german version of ` deus vult ' ? 
  the housing estates - soon to be ghettos - to house them in already exist , it appears . 
  this is going to be disastrous . 
  yes . 
  i was referring to the person whose quote was used as the title . 
  ' * but what about the evil evil nazis ?? 
  * ' that is what these people sound like . 
  by ` regressive left ' i mean the political factions that claim too uphold humanist values but in reality only protect islam . 
  i care and i said what you said in other words : i want a paradigm shift to come about that makes it possible to talk about this in the open instead of being shamed for it and being called a racist by the regressive left . 
   ah yes , the `` migrant '' culture , which is one homogenic bloc of people who all think the same . 
  underdeveloped pre-sexual revolution islamic patriarchical societies . 
  that is the common cultural heritage of 90 % + of the migrants . 
   your comment is representative a wider cultural tendency amongst some other people , you can guess what it is , it starts with an r and ends with m. skin colour or ethnicity does n't play a role here . 
  culture is the factor i am talking about . 
  some cultures are better than others . 
  western humanist values are superior when compared with islamic cultures from the middle east . 
  i hope that these news events will cause a paradigm shift in the public opinion , where we view the negative aspects of immigration from third world countries in a transparent manner instead of engaging in apologetics for the crimes of migrants . 
  it is long overdue that we stop reasoning away the downsides of migration through magical thinking . 
  i hope that the borders will be closed . 
  meanwhile , i also hope no further harm will be inflicted , not ** by ** refugees , as well as not ** on ** refugees . 
  ` random rapes ' is a misnomer . 
  these assaults occured in a disruptive crowd of migrants in once concentrated location . 
  the police should have broken up the crowd by force after the first riotous behavior started . 
  i replied to your comment . 
  i replied that generalizations are possible because these men are representative of a wider cultural tendency among these people . 
  it is better to translate `` sollen '' with ` allegedly ' than ` would ' . 
  the young men that committed those assaults are representative of a misogynist culture that clashes with western humanist values . 
  yes ? 
  that was the most neutral term i could think of . 
  both ` economic migrant ' and ` refugee ' imply an adherence to a particular narrative . 
  they should have used the water cannon on new year 's eve , not to disrupt the civilian 's right to protest . 
  they abuse our hospitality . 
  they have overstayed their welcome and we should completely close the borders as soon as possible . 
  no more migrants . 
  good . 
  the migrants have overstayed their welcome . 
  smells like a troll . 
  and tastes like vomit, 
  clapping is * so * american though . 
  he is the scapegoat . 
  the actual people that can be blamed for this are the german politicians . 
  i hope the german public votes them out . 
  among these ` innocent refugees ' are also th men that raped women on new year 's eve . 
  the current calls for a stop to the stream of refugees are not baseless . 
  sure , the majority of migrants are good people , as the ratio of kind people to utter fuckwads is roughly the same all over the world , but the clash of cultures and the abundance of young men raised in religiously conservative third world environments has led to a wave of sexual assaults . 
  hypothetical example : 50,000 radicalized salafist muslims in france could sign a petition calling for the french government to drop a nuclear bomb on washington d.c. ; that does n't mean that `` the french call for a nuke on the capital of the u.s. '' , it just means that a small but vocal minority has publicly declared their viewpoint . 
  ** act like an ordinary person , that way you are already acting more eccentric than necessary . 
  ** this is a loose translation of the dutch saying ' * doe maar normaal , dan doe je al gek genoeg * ', 
  imposing tough guidelines ? 
  how can guidelines be tough and be imposed ? 
  you 're confusing the huffington post and the washington post . 
  this article is by the washington post . 
  were you born in the us or in hungary ? 
  the polish political party that changes their stance on russia will be completely annihilated in the next election . 
  it 's not going to happen . 
  there is not a shred of popular support for that . 
  hungary , on the other hand , might be more likely to change its geopolitics . 
   we do n't even know if he 's a foreigner yet . 
  in the wake of the previous attacks , it 's likely that he 's a french national . 
  might be , but all perpetrators thus far have a foreign background , i.e. 
  either their parents or grandparents were born in a non-western country . 
  it does n't make sense to let even more people like that in our countries . 
  sure , the ratio of nice people versus utter fuckwads is roughly the same throughout earth , but the clash of cultures is what creates these terrorist attacks . 
  integration has largely failed . 
  why ? 
  there is no precedence for accomodating other religious groups this way , why should muslims get a special treatment ? 
  i have the horrible feeling that we might see another , succesful attack today too . 
  to have leverage over potential hostages maybe ? 
  it does n't make sense to criticize the police . 
  criticize the politicians that defunded the police . 
   it 's all your own fault ladies , stop having fun and being so independent !, 
  it 's victim-blaming . 
  disgusting action by the city council . 
  this will create an incentive for others to try it too . 
  mark my words , within a week we 'll see a news article on a migrant being run over by a train in the channel tunnel . 
  oh , i have enough sympathy . 
  they should seek refuge in the nearest safe country , not go windowshopping for welfare and end up in the uk . 
  we ca n't host all of the third world . 
  sun to square ? 
  what does the second icon say ? 
  sadly , i know and i think you 're right . 
  romania is outstanding when it comes to creative ways of corruption . 
  the parliament should vote to close that loophole then . 
  if lukashenko dies tomorrow , another leader will be propped up by russia . 
  belarus is almost an extraterritorial province of russia . 
  i suspect schengen will fall before that happens . 
  schengen is not natural law , it 's just an agreement between countries . 
  then it is time to hold germany accountable for once , similar to how germany always holds other countries in the eu accountable for their actions . 
  on facebook , you can just defriend someone . 
  there is a case to be made that our generation 's reliance on customized social media feeds have made us want to ban stuff that we do n't like , because we 're accustomed to doing the same on social media . 
   also change that disgusting alias this is not your facebook feed where you can just delete that which you do not like .
