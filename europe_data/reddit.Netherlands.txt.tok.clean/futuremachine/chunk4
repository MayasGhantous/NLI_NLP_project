  mark rutte is actually a pretty good orator . 
  i am directly at odds with him on a lot of viewpoints , but you ca n't deny he is one of the few dutch prime ministers we 've had whose rhetoric abilities are decidedly not sub-par . 
   the emotional state of doubt and quivering shame that assuages someone who 's pretending like they know , perfectly well , where and what the baltic countries are canada 's new prime minister trudeau experienced this exact emotion a little while ago . 
  op is not american , op is french . 
  salmiak is god 's gift to humanity , the hate is unfounded . 
  it is an acquired taste . 
  semantics . 
  but it is through tv licenses . 
   year in memes  from punching sharks to pizza rat - what went viral in 2015 ? 
  to all britons , this is what your taxes pay for . 
  ` record-high lows ' is a very poor word choice . 
  they were locals visiting a fortress in their own region , which makes them tourists . 
  no , just plain old caucasian jihadi 's . 
  that region is an hotbed of islamist terrorism . 
  i know , but for the casual onlooker it might not be immediately clear and they might think there is a big diplomatic dispute between belgium and the netherlands where there is n't any . 
  `` force '' is a bit of misnomer for that treaty . 
  no , you shall not pass . 
  your police literally had to go to your own peninsula by boat because you had no permission to travel via dutch territory . 
  the netherlands , proudly reclaiming land from the sea and its neighbors alike . 
  disappear for a couple of months ? 
  `` dissappearances '' in a political sense are permanent . 
  that 's a very inaccurate and hopelessly romantic view of russian history . 
  wwii is pockmarked by the disregard for human life from the soviet side . 
  the soviet generals sacrificed millions of men in meatgrinders for little reason . 
  many soviet soldiers died unnecessary deaths because they were assigned hopeless tasks where 90 % died and all those who fled were shot for desertion . 
  the red army raped and killed civilians en masse . 
  then , when wwii was over , eastern europe was subjected to the warsaw pact . 
  any dissent was crushed . 
  millions were deported and/or killed in the ussr . 
  ethnic groups were displaced , constituting what would be labelled genocides these days . 
  the soviet and warsaw pact economy did n't grow that well compared to western countries . 
  the dismantling of the ussr and the change to oligarchy is something that was largely orchestrated by opportunist businessmen , who enrich themselves at the expense of the masses . 
  russia is a nation that is characterized by tragedy , human suffering and failure . 
  as if that was a huge mystery, 
  eastern-orthodox and catholic influence more likely , right ? 
  though i understand the ussr also considered homosexuality bourgeous initially . 
  turkey will not join the union for decades . 
  would it make sense for moldova to integrate into romania ? 
  how strong are irredentist sentiments in both countries ? 
  it consolidates the influence of the european union in the balkans . 
  got ta catch 'em all . 
  ah that makes sense , i thought you were referring to an hypothetical ` syrian defence forces ' . 
  minor correction , it is usually referred to as the saa , not the sdf . 
  why would you feel guilty about not giving to roma beggars ? 
  they are part of organized beggar syndicates . 
  that money ends up paying for a rich roma 's villa . 
  why ? 
  we 've never had harsh winters , but it 's definitely been warmer across the board the past two decades or so . 
  we used to get a winter with a week of snow every now and then , but now that does n't happen anymore at all . 
  calling the left `` liberals '' is a dead giveaway that you 're american . 
   waiting for the army marching into ghettos . 
  what makes you think that would happen ? 
  this is what winters have been like for decades now over here in the netherlands . 
  occassionally we get a little bit of snow , which usually turns into slush and meltwater the next day . 
  it would be a truly weird winter if iceland of all places did n't have a decent amount of snow . 
  fun fact : here up in the north of the dutch language area , the `` zalig kerstfeest '' ( `` a blessed christmas '' ) in your opening post is something that mostly only deeply religious dutch people say . 
  i believe it is much more common among secular flemish people though . 
  corporations have got something to gain from more immigration , as immigration drives down wages . 
  there is thus an incentive to not act . 
  i believe certain european nations ' indifference to the problems in this process is because the powerful have got something to gain from this . 
  why would people other than belgians make that decision ? 
  we know this . 
  we 're criticizing it . 
  laws do n't dictate morality , they merely influence it slightly . 
  i never knew willem-alexander preoccupied himself with dj ` ing . 
  what is the austrian treatment of ' 99 ? 
  an annihilation in the next elections ? 
  german ( and many dutch ) toilets have a small shelf , presumably so you can smell your own shit , idk . 
  i say `` houdoe '' ( dialectical greeting ) when departing the bus over here in nijmegen , the netherlands . 
  we do n't do this in the netherlands despite our countries being very similar in other respects . 
  indeed . 
  islam as an idea can and shouldbe criticized . 
  it is not good to throw all muslims under the bus , but it is a harsh reality that a majority of the muslims adhere viewpoints that are at odds with western values . 
  this does n't mean that these people are inherently bad , it means that the religion in which they were raised is bad . 
  i 'll reiterate : islam should be criticized , as all religions have been criticized in the past and the present . 
  islam does n't require a special exception to that long tradition of dialectic between critics and apologetics . 
   speaking in the southern city of toulouse , mr cazeneuve said ** 10 attacks ** had been foiled in france so far this year . 
  we have most likely hosted the people behind those foiled attacks , their parents , or their grandparents with lots of hospitality , and this is our reward . 
  how ungrateful . 
  how is that related to him being or not being a leftist, 
  not at all, 
  `` traditional marriage '' is a disingenuous phrase . 
  it just hides that one is a homophobe . 
  homosexuality is not immoral . 
  do n't tell me what to do , kid . 
  yes , but the plane was en route from mauritius to france , ca n't imagine there are terribly many mauritians vacationing in france this time of the year , but probably a hella lot more frenchmen . 
   flight af463 , with ** 459 passengers and 14 crew members ** on board if it is really a bomb and it had went off , it would be the biggest terrorist attack on european nationals ever . 
  / r/conservative and most of the republican party of the usa will gladly oblige . 
  ( sadly enough ), 
  too much charles dickens . 
  the idea of a white christmas entered european folklore largely because of his books . 
  coincidentally , charles dickens youth was marked by the longest streak of white christmases the uk had seen for quite some time . 
  in the netherlands , we call the dutch christian lobby the `` polder taliban '' . 
  i find it really interesting how much this submissions was downvoted initially . 
  68 % of the dutch are against more refugees . 
  less than half are in favour of asylum centers in their town without any conditions . 
  the 71 % includes those who said there 'd be scenarios where they 'd be okay with it , under conditions . 
  29 % are against it no matter what . 
  the south african nazis use a symbol that is eerily similar to the manx tripede . 
  the signage itself is intuitive , but i frequently find myself wandering aimlessly for some time because for some reason i keep missing stuff like gate numbers and so on .
