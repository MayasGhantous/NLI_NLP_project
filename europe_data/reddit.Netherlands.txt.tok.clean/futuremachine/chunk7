  they did n't fly over estonian territory , just very near to it with their transponders off . 
  just the geopolitical version of `` i am not touching you '' . 
  just a minor correction : turk , not turkmen . 
  japan is n't even that out of the ordinary : russia and japan have a long-standing territorial dispute over the kuril islands . 
  between putin bringing out his dog during merkel 's visit , fully knowing that merkel has a phobia for dogs ever since being bitten as a child by one , the constant violations of european airspace and the quirky photo ops doing karate with tigers in a submarine , i am fully convinced putin is a manchild and schoolyard bully who accidentally became president . 
   `` everyone said , ` you ca n't do this , ''' according to a former staffer , `` but she said , ` in romania , a minister can do whatever they want . ''' so telling of the general atmosphere in romanian politics . 
  an irishman ? 
  what 's that union jack doing in your flair ? 
  [ are these two news items connected ? 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/howlin-forecasts-spectacular-growth-of-7-for-2015-1.2460622 ), 
  interestingly enough , a lot of podemos supporters have organized themselves on reddit in / r/podemos . 
  a good friend of mine is a well-integrated roma . 
  we just do n't really notice them because they are outwardly consistent with our idea of what a roma looks like , and they have often been integrated in european society for more than a century . 
  i am still under the impression that well-integrated roma are sadly few and far between in western europe however . 
  you ca n't imagine how disgusted i am by my own country 's handwashing habits . 
  that 's why tens of thousands of kosovars are applying for asylum in west europe . 
  hate to burst your bubble , but kosova probably has the lowest living standards in all of europe . 
  gypsies originate from neither romania nor egypt . 
  they are originally from northern india . 
  looks like it is inside the pyramids of gizeh, 
  even the name al\u00feingi sounds cute !, 
   were those awful commie block apartments with satellite dishes build very recently ? 
  they 're from the 1950s and 1960s , build when housing was scarce after wwii . 
  we mockingly call them schotelparadijsen ( `` satellite dish paradises '' ) . 
  transport plays a super minor role in the budget of all nations , no exceptions . 
  the big money drains are welfare and health ( note : i support that , i am not a small government guy ) . 
  me and my friends drove to bertrix ( yeah , that village where dutroux kidnapped some of his victims ) for a vacation , so we drove through maastricht and straight from the netherlands to wallonia . 
  the difference in roads and urban planning cracked us up for the rest of the road trip . 
  you 'd expect a city called nice would have nice roads . 
  no , they 're not , you russiaweeaboo . 
  russia started this war . 
  god , can you throw in any more baseless buzzword accusations in there ? 
  up north in the netherlands those certainly exist . 
  similarly , there are communities in the netherlands where absolute majorities vote for a conservative christian party that is comparable with the religious right factions in the american republicans . 
  these kinds of insular political oddities are not even that rare . 
  in the netherlands we have four leftist parties with parliamentary representation : a labour party that fits your description of only being concerned with multiculturalism , a social democrat party that is still primarily concerned with worker 's rights , and two environmentalist parties . 
  right-wing parties in europe are n't traditionally fascist either anymore . 
  that 's not the point . 
  according to international conventions , every asylum seeker has the right to be entered in an asylum procedure that determines whether they can stay or not . 
  norway is now offering a lump sum , which is ** less ** than the cost of the asylum procedure , to people under the condition that they opt out of the asylum procedure and return to their own country without having entered the asylum procedure in the first place . 
  so it is essentially norway saving money and man hours . 
  it costs them less to offer these asylum seekers a bribe than to have them enter the asylum procedure . 
  that would cost the norwegian state even more money to organize that . 
  you 'd need to continuously track those people 's locations in third world shitholes and you 'd need to make sure that the money arrives at the person you intended . 
  the norwegian state does n't care what those people do with that money . 
  they do n't care about guiding these people towards a good life . 
  they just want them out , ** and rightfully so . 
  ** they 're essentially offering those asylum seekers a bribe with the condition that they fuck off to wherever the hell they came from . 
  it even saves them money , because those bribes are less expensive than that person entering the asylum procedure . 
   and then sweden send them elsewhere . 
  that would be somewhat unexpected and un-swedish . 
  sweden is probably the last country to introduce sensible immigration policies . 
  they had food and a safe place to stay in turkey too . 
  according to international conventions , they deserve to have their asylum request processed . 
  that costs the norwegian state a lot of money . 
  however , a lot of asylum seekers have discovered upon arriving that they wo n't be eligible for asylum . 
  the norwegian state is now offering them money to leave straightaway , instead of waiting out the asylum procedure . 
  the amount of money offered is ** less ** than what the asylum procedure will cost . 
  hence , the norwegian state is saving money and man hours , and as a bonus they get rid of those thousands of people whose asylum request will not be granted anyway . 
  * shi'ite and sunnite , sunnites are in the majority, 
  i was n't trying to be an ass , i just was genuinely curious . 
  why are you even responding to him in french ? 
  he most likely does n't even speak it . 
  of non-state actors . 
  holy shit , this bot is good , it almost fooled my tired mind . 
   i do n't know whether there 's a denomination of islam that 's compatible with these things , but so far it looks unlikely , in my very limited experience there is [ ahmadiyya ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ahmadiyya ) , but non-ahmadiyya muslims hate their guts , unfortunately . 
  `` summarising the islamic faith , ahmad writes : '' * `` there are only two complete parts of faith . 
  one is to love god and the other is to love mankind to such a degree that you consider the suffering and the trials and tribulations of others as your own and that you pray for them . 
  '' * `` concerning terrorism , the fourth caliph of the community [ of ahmadiyya ] writes : '' * `` as far as islam is concerned , it categorically rejects and condemns every form of terrorism . 
  it does not provide any cover or justification for any act of violence , be it committed by an individual , a group or a government '' * `` ahmadi muslims believe that there can not be a conflict between the word of god and the work of god , and thus religion and science must work in harmony with each other . '', 
  `` the ahmadiyya movement in islam universally accept in principle the process of evolution , albeit divinely guided , and actively promotes it . 
  over the course of several decades the movement has issued various publications in support of the scientific concepts behind the process of evolution , and frequently engages in promoting how religious scripture supports the concept . '', 
  whatever it is what op allegedly did , calling somebody a `` racist '' without a good reason only serves to shut down the discussion . 
  of course , but the only example that directly threatens european safety that i can think of right now is islamism . 
  wbc is a few loonies with no support outside their own church . 
  that does n't compare to the literal millions of people supporting isis . 
  am i my brother 's shepherd ? 
  that notion you propose seems more like blackmail to me - `` you will take these people , or else they will kill ! '', 
  unbelievable . 
  just absolutely , utterly insane . 
  this is what it has led to , the notion that any criticism of islam is morally reprehensible . 
  ca n't hover over it on my phone, 
  meh , i am a progressive leftist myself , i just hate islam . 
  i just do not get the regressive people defending a hateful ideology that is counter to all liberal humanist values that i stand for . 
  i am in fact leftist myself , i just hate islam . 
  what point do you so desperately want to extract out of my comment ? 
  i quite clearly condemned the people that enable islamism , and only them . 
  whatever man , you go do you and believe what you wan na believe i supposedly said . 
  i did not say that . 
  you read that into it . 
  it is not clear from your flair which country you 're from . 
  the ba'athist party under hussein 's leadership harshly repressed political factions in the shi'a iraqi community . 
  while several shi'ites were highranking members of the ba'athist party , hussein himself was sunni and his foreign policy is marked by his struggle to ensure that shi'a majority countries did n't gain more political power . 
  hafez al-assad , an alawite shi'a , and the iranian government , which is twelver shi'a , hated ba'athist iraq and hussein , and vice versa . 
  i am not saying that . 
  do n't extract an absolute statement out of my comment that is not there . 
  i said that the ones enabling islamism are culpable , not `` all '' leftists . 
  that will never happen , because catholic churches are funded by the holy see , which is obviously a foreign entity . 
  enabling a situation that makes terrorism likely makes people culpable in my mind too . 
   the murder of two dutch people ( one of them being a politician ) to finally get rid of that terrible climate .
