  theo van gogh and pim fortuyn were their names , for the non-dutch people reading this . 
  pim fortuyn was a presidential candidate and the leader of the lpf party . 
  he was murdered - shot to death - in 2001 by a radical leftist activist . 
  van gogh was a film director and columnist renowned for his firm stance against the islam . 
  he was murdered in 2003 , by an islamist . 
  saddam hussein was sunni , not shi'a, 
  really ? 
  i live in nijmegen and i did n't even know that . 
  sealand , not zealand . 
  you know , the micronation on that oil platform . 
   surprisingly for a right-wing party , quite popular with gays , particularly in paris . 
  the ( hard ) right wing in europe is usually not associated with conservative christianity , so many of those parties , especially in western europe , are not opposed to same sex marriage . 
  many gay people feel threatened by the insane homophobia that comes with islam . 
  many have experienced harassment by young muslim youth . 
  # ** rightful sealand clay !, 
  the russian conquest of the far east . 
  i ca n't read serbian . 
  a translation other than a shoddy automated translation would be nice . 
  no , because he would n't be able to proof that the name in the computer is him . 
  he 'd need an id for that . 
  yet you chose to represent yourself with a limburgian flag , not a dutch flag . 
  that says something about regional identity . 
  too little people to have any real regional identity separatism . 
  also , 2/3rds of them live in the capital city anyway . 
  what even happened to the rhine delta in my cpuntry ? 
  anyway , the fact that it includes cornwall but not limburg is a serious oversight . 
  oh , and ** where ** are luhansk and donetsk ? 
   if you truly have to have that explained to you then you are absolutely not worth the effort . 
  maybe you do n't know how to explain it concisely ? 
  is that it ? 
  the horseshoe theory is not taken seriously in political science . 
  what can an average french citizen do to stop this ? 
  okay so the situation is as follows : 1 ) we have a group of people , among which are many that cause trouble , disproportionely so compared to the rest of the population 2 ) `` you know what we should do ? 
  let ** more ** of those people in our country i do n't understand that . 
  muslims are fine , as long as they become more moderate or secularize . 
  islam is the cancer , and we should n't let more immigrants come to europe when we do n't even know how to secularize the existing immigrant population . 
  correct . 
  wilders is a left-wing progressive with anti-immigration and anti-islam viewpoints . 
  what is front national 's gripe with jews ? 
  i 'll gladly play whack-a-mole with salafis . 
  do n't ask saudi arabia to stop . 
  stop saudi arabian funding from arriving in your country by enacting legislation against foreign funding of religious institutions . 
  how is that misogynistic ? 
  i did n't ? 
  the perpetrator was male . 
  i think it is fair to label this guy a * cunt * instead of the more palatable * prick * . 
   there are currently conflicting information , according to tabloid daily kurir the man ** complained that he had lost his mind ** and wanted to take them all together with him to allah . 
  but in the interview to tanjug ( serbian news agency ) , hc vojvodina president milan djukic who was on the plane , told that his impression was that the man was ** psychologically unstable ** and that what he had done was not an attempted act of terrorism . 
  emphasis added by me . 
  those two things are the same right ? 
   united kingdom  get a license and take a gun ( if your country 's laws allow it ) ; yeah , about that ... 
  while that is true , wahhabism , the doctrine of the house of saud , became big because of western nations supporting the saudi 's . 
  why the non sequitur reference to france then, 
  i am not from france though lmao, 
  that does n't mean i agree with that however . 
  neither civil law nor common law are based on christian law . 
  `` it 's not a phase mom , this is who i am ! '', 
  did n't the ira target on a near-weekly basis ? 
  this underground legal system should be completely eradicated to the core . 
  everything about it is wrong and at odds with the liberal , humanist foundations of european civil society . 
  it simply ** ca n't ** co-exist with the current legal system . 
  the focus should be on complete assimilation of immigrants in the host country 's culture . 
  modern feminists most definitely often declare their denomination . 
  on reddit , / r/feminism is mostly populated by liberal feminists , / r/feminisms ( with an extra `` s '' ) mostly by radical feminists , and / r/srsfeminism mostly by socialist feminists/intersectional feminists and womanists . 
  and that is just for online feminism on reddit , irl groups tend to be associated with political parties and movements , which is even more partisan . 
  my grandparents are dutch reformed church , but they idemtify themselves as christians first when asked about their religion . 
  surely it is not inconceivable thay feminists do the same ? 
  after all , it is a little pretentious to say in a casual conversation : `` i am a trans-inclusionary intersectional feminist with womanist and lacanian influences '' . 
   i 'm sure they exist in that some people have tried to invent them , but they 're definitely not widely used . 
  you could not be more wrong . 
  feminism has a long and rich history of lots of infighting and faction-formation . 
  leftist movements are ** notorious ** for their sectarianism . 
  there is a saying that there are as many socialist movements as there are socialists . 
  the same goes for feminism : the sheer amount of infighting and sub-movements is a testament to the complexity of the history of activism . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/feminist_movements_and_ideologies it does n't make it so that you have to automatically agree with feminism now , but i would like to say that it is important to research a subject a little before speaking with authority on a subject . 
  as a sidenote : the patriarchy is understood to be an unorganized societal attitude , not an organized conspiracy . 
  eh , those denomination names definitely exist , not sure what you 're on about . 
  patriarchy is not a conscious conspiracy in the traditional sense , but a largely unorganized societal attitude . 
  support for iraq invasions stretches ` deep into parts of blair 's brain ' , says anonymous redditor . 
  i live in one of the 10 poorest neighborhoods of the netherlands and i am doing just fine . 
  you could always move to a cheap flat in a rural town if you 're so hellbent on avoiding immigrants . 
  besides , check out this : https://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/de/us as for the us justice system : it is inconsistent , suffers from a blue wall of silence and it often suffers from miscarriages of justice . 
  also : the shitty parts of american cities are really shit , compared to europe . 
  yeah , and your story belongs there too . 
  you are a pussy anyway if you get driven out of your country by a burglary and a subsequent error of justice . 
  the us is much worse when it comes to crime rates and police handling of crimes . 
  / r/thathappened anyway , no one cares . 
  so 2 % of the total kosovar population requested asylum in less than one year 's time ? 
  that 's insane !, 
  wonder what 's prompting such a massive displacement . 
  what are secondos ? 
  the tiny nation of gambia ? 
  why is that ? 
  that you 're doing the right thing probably , if the kremlin condemns you . 
   so this article has been lifted exactly word for word from this reuters article . . reuters is a press agency . 
  news outlets buy their articles . 
  you 're confusing hungary and finland , mate . 
  syrians and iraqi speak arabic , a ** semitic ** language . 
  he knows . 
  / u/executivemonkey is / r/europe 's resident troll .
