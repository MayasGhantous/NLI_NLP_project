  ireland , uk , you feel our pain , right ? 
  apparently , also a lot of cocaine use . 
  i 'd be drugged up all the time as well if i had to live in such an isolated community . 
  it used to be an island , but then we decided to polder it . 
  worst . 
  decision . 
  ever . 
  a concrete jungle . 
  when it 's a terrorist attack , we should start calling it what it is , not sweep it under the rug as an ` isolated incident ' . 
  however , anyone who believes this was a terrorist attack should go back to whatever nationalist circlejerk they came from . 
  this is * not * a terrorist attack . 
  it 's a crime of passion . 
  thankfully , americans are n't very good with drawing the map of europe either . 
  it 's hard to draw a map , so i 'll take that for granted , but naming all the countries on a blank page ... not that great . 
  that said , most europeans could only identify a few states . 
  that looks pretty . 
  well , that was surprisingly well made . 
   a ) no central language - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistic_diversity_index - as an example , india 's primary language for the army is english because of the immense diversity in language across the country hence what would be the central language ? 
  english when we 've left the eu and stuck two fingers up to it ? 
  no idea under what rock you 've been living , but it 's come to be quite accepted that english is the predominant 2nd language for many people in europe . 
  english will do just fine . 
   b ) this is would be a sign of aggression that russia or china will not like one bit . 
  that 's no surprise , but it 's not as if russia or china have any moral high ground here . 
   c ) it will lead to a decrease in overall european army strength . 
  economies of scale , cutback on defence budget as there is no need for large individual armies when there is one overarching one . 
  you are wrong . 
  plenty of sources suggest that the overall defense budget of the european countries are way too low , with a few exceptions . 
  ( poland , turkey , norway , uk ) and most of the armies are technologically advanced , but few in number . 
  the amount of non-operational vehicles in storage are staggering . 
  few armies in europe have the mobility necessary on the battlefield . 
  if you 'd like , i could delve a bit and find these sources , but to give you an example , [ germany 's few tanks left are underequipped ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11420627/german-army-used-broomsticks-instead-of-guns-during-training.html ) . 
  juncker , even though i find it a generally unlikeable fellow , made the same suggestion orban did a while ago . 
  in the research , the result was that europe would have a ** more ** effective fighting force , for ** less ** financial costs . 
  europe would have a stronger army , not a weaker one . 
  i agree with him . 
   d ) what would happen with france 's nuclear weapons ? 
  if a european army occurred , you can fuck right off if it meant that a nation like italy starts trouble whilst posturing with nukes . 
  mussolini died more than 70 years ago . 
  take it easy . 
  but i see your point : other countries could abuse it . 
  but i 'm fairly certain this wont happen . 
   e ) why do you need one when you have nato ? 
  nato is not a reliable initiative if more than half of its members ca n't assemble an effective fighting force . 
   f ) soldiers from estonia dying for french victims of a terrorist attack due to a european general ordering a ground troop strike on is in syria ? 
  logic . 
  i see your point . 
  this makes sense . 
  this needs to be taken into account . 
   g ) it would not be in the us ' interest at all to have a european army as it would deeply upset the geopolitical situation + the uk would certainly not want a great big fucking army on its doorstep . 
  the us has interest , or at least would be ambivalent to it . 
  after all , we 're still nato . 
  uk included , and i most certainly do n't see why anyone in europe would want to invade the uk . 
  ( not anymore , at least ) why would they be afraid ? 
   h ) if it ever did occur , its defence spending ( presuming taking advantage of economies of scale and cutting it down overall ) would be eclipsed by far by the us ' / china 's / india 's defence spending ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/348164/20140821_dcdc_gst_5_web_secured.pdf - page 94 ) and only slightly larger than russia . 
  i do n't see your point , to be honest . 
   i ) military complex of europe would collapse . 
  aerospace industry take a huge hit if they want efficiency and homogenisation across the board . 
  want efficiency and want to cut costs ? 
  amazing !, 
  so you want one jet with one engine type to cut costs ? 
  even better ! . 
  let 's give the contract to dassault and make the dassault rafale with its snecma engine the rule across europe . 
  goodbye saab and eurofighter consortium , goodbye rolls-royce because you wo n't be needing them if you are creating a single jet , single engine type et al , only need one r&d department for all that and goodbye millions of jobs across europe if you include cutbacks on the amount of troops , hardware such as tanks and vehicles and shipbuilding industry . 
  military contractors will fill in where needed . 
  such is the market . 
  i do n't see the issue - as it will cut back costs for all governments on their military spending . 
   j ) someone wants to increase defence spending , someone wants to decrease defence spending ... you tell me who dictates what ? 
  france wants to build an aircraft carrier , why should latvia foot the bill for that ? 
  spending should be defined by the money that is provided by the nations . 
  there would be a budget - latvia alone would n't foot the bill for it , but merely contribute a part . 
  also , in your case , france ca n't just decide to build a carrier : it would have to be in the interest for all countries involved . 
  war exhaustion most likely . 
  the armenians ( which had barely a standing army to speak of ) and the greeks were the ones who fought the hardest . 
  the other western countries involved were too busy licking their wounds , i guess . 
  you 're actually right about that , my apologies . 
  fixed up my comment . 
  sorry for being a bit late on this , but i 'm pretty well aware with what you mean . 
  i wrote a pretty sizeable comment about it a year ago . 
  [ here it is ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3jwxaf/israel_plans_to_demolish_up_to_17000_structures/cutb3dv?st=ir1elvvo&amp;sh=e9b73c46 ) . 
  in retrospect , i would 've phrased a few things about it differently , but in the gist of it , i 'm pretty content with what i wrote . 
  no , i do feel a bit different on how we mean fearmongering . 
  there 's a threat , and it 's not one made up - it exists and it 's very real . 
  past events have shown this , and there 's a good amount of people who would like nothing more than to see israel gone off the map . 
  but netanyahu promotes a hawkish lobby , and uses it to gain support as well . 
  with how he does so , it 's fearmongering in my book . 
  however , i 'm convinced that the idf in and of itself handles the situation quite decently and moral under the given circumstances , though i do not particularly sympathize with how the israeli state deals with foreign policy - especially in the palestinian west bank . 
  i 'm just glad knowing most turkish , especially in the western part of the country , are n't really happy with it either . 
  i have faith in that . 
  not sure how that runs in germany , but the burger king is dirt cheap in the netherlands . 
  you get a small meal for $ 2 , burger , fries and a soda . 
  not a bad deal if you ask me . 
  state welfare for the disabled . 
  not entirely certain how it works in france , but most european countries have a welfare state that 's somewhat comparable . 
  i 've been on welfare for disabled ( had a burnout ) , which is quite generous . 
  i also know someone who 's still on the ` old ' system , which is ridiculously generous . 
  you can easily afford a small vacation if you save up . 
  after i finish my study and get a job/internship , it 's likely it 'll be removed , but that 's okay . 
   pretty sure it 's just a meme . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  i 've seen that one getting mixed up by non-europeans/aussies a lot of times .
