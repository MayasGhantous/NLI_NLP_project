  just like when people in online gaming ask me `` where you 're from ? 
  '' , i respond with `` i 'm dutch '' and 9/10 times people assume i 'm german . 
  i 've come to learn that responding with `` holland '' or `` netherlands '' is the best way to go : never imply you 're dutch . 
  it 's a bit of an annoying mix-up , but it 's understandable . 
  just like austria/australia . 
  yeah , was about to say the same . 
  this is * far * from unresasonable . 
  the eu military is a joke anyway . 
  i give junckers right on his part to create a fully unified eu army . 
  it 'll be cheaper * and * more efficient . 
  the huge lack of equipment and vehicles ( that are n't in storage and in need of repair ) are staggering . 
  missing ? 
  nah , they 're on their way to erdogan 's secret underwater lair . 
  go back to / pol /, 
  it 's like a kickstarter funding . 
  it 'll be there in 3 months . 
  we 're just making some ` calibrations ' and ` transitions ' right now , but it 'll be there soon . 
  you mean 100 reichsmark ? 
  what do you need 200 reichsmark for ? 
  it 'll need quite a match to light that powderkeg , but i would n't be surprised if kosovo could let it blow . 
  the ottomans , apparently . 
  it 's a little different then that . 
  it surprises me few people know this ( at least , in the west ) , but at the end of the 1st world war there was the [ treaty of sevr\u00e9s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_s%c3%a8vres ) , which was a proposed partitioning of the lands of the ottoman empire . 
  anatolia itself was sliced up by european imperialists , as well as greece taking back old land ( and areas inhabitated by plenty of greeks ) . 
  when the turkish war of independence started , mustafa kemal ataturk - and others - were the leading front to fight back . 
  in the end , they won . 
  ataturk 's leadership thereafter left his legacy the most , though , completely restructuring and modernizing the country . 
  though not truly one , his reign had numerous influences you see in fascism . 
  during the 2nd world war , they had a pact with the western allies , but they left shortly after the capture of france , deciding to stay completely neutral instead , fearing possible war with russia and germany 's allies . 
  due to these things , the impact of fascism and the horrors of the war and extremist politics were n't as close to home . 
  that does n't mean they were oblivious to it , but were n't as affected by it . 
  there was n't really a generation that remembers it the same way the other countries in europe do . 
  it is possible ( though , by speculation ) that these methods as this flourish better nowadays than most of europe . 
  and do n't forget , turkey is right in the thick of war and international tension right now . 
  fearmongering is an effective tactic when your country 's on full alert . 
  a good example of this is netanyahu 's government in israel , able to strengthen his grip on the country simply because many israelis are rather ` safe than sorry ' and will buy into fearmongering . 
  one of my best friends is from saudi arabia , he studied here some time ago and went back . 
  ( call me paranoid , i 'm going to leave out the details ) ever since he went back , he 's having a reverse culture-shock and is somewhat vocal on his social media . 
  i 've helped him out how to use a vpn before he left ( just in case , glad i did ) , it 's been a while now and every time he drops off the radar for whatever reason more than a few days , it always itches me `` what if he 's in jail , or worse ? '' . 
  i 've urged him plenty of times to go somewhere else . 
  he 's well educated and speaks fluent english . 
  ironically , me , him and a mutual friend of ours agreed turkey was the best option . 
  ( in the west , a visa might 've become a problem ), 
  saw a documentary on it a while back . 
  you dont join a gang , you 're in one depending on your neighbourhood . 
  you do n't have a choice , whether you like it or not . 
  family is less related to it . 
  you do realize that the vast majority of shootings are targeted right ? 
  it could just so happen that if you 're unfortunate you get caught in the crossfire , or have a particularly unfortunate incident with an armed robbery . 
  i might have dropped an / s there somewhere . 
  ca n't find it though . 
  yep , that 's what i meant . 
  at least we did n't drive our only cannon into a ditch . 
   modern era  still uses old cannons kek, 
  being skeptic is different than saying `` i want it all to crumble down '' and comparing it to a tyrannical regime . 
  you 're like a real life version of fox 's `` fair and balanced '' slogan . 
  because you 're not . 
  i 've been saying the same thing for years . 
  they should be one of the ` ruling parties ' , and we 'll see how fast it 'll come crashing down . 
  my money would be on the coalition partners saying `` fuck it , i 'm done '' , but there 's a chance the pvv itself will simply collapse on its own . 
  mostly due to the fact most of the pvv politicians are absolute fucking idiots . 
  it makes wilders look reasonable , calm and collected in comparison . 
  good . 
  i 'll get rid of the post then . 
  too bad netherlands is n't on it . 
  would 've liked to know . 
  on the other hand , i 'm pretty sure i 'd expect what the results would be . 
  ( fairly much like the other countries ), 
  to be fair though , sicily was a muslim possession under the fatimid caliphate for some time . 
  but that was over 1000 years ago so it is n't accurate anymore . 
  do you even car , bro ? 
  i always thought that were vice-versa . 
  quality kek here . 
  we 've pretty much annexed half of their countrysides by now with our cheap caravans , so i do n't think that will be necessary . 
  just a shame a lot of people 's reviews are equally as hateful . 
  damn shame . 
  [ except for this one turkish fellow ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/hatemo%c4%9flu+otel/@39.720853,43.052963,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m7!1e2!3m5!1s-usco7h-m5fa%2fwn2guylbbvi%2faaaaaaaaas4%2fzvir95_ftfmhc7dhelpq4zeforj_6i7dwcjkc!2e4!6s%2f%2flh5.googleusercontent.com%2f-usco7h-m5fa%2fwn2guylbbvi%2faaaaaaaaas4%2fzvir95_ftfmhc7dhelpq4zeforj_6i7dwcjkc%2fw137-h90-k-no%2f!7i585!8i383!4m7!3m6!1s0x0:0xfc2d3f6d6b0f425f!8m2!3d39.720853!4d43.052963!9m1!1b1!6m1!1e1 ) rating it 1 star . 
  that 's kinda cool . 
  oh and someone posted a summary of the history of the yamato battleship along with his review . 
  falcon kick !, 
  i expected france to be more religious . 
  also due to a relatively high amount of migration . 
  portugal is an example of that as well . 
  this just in : netherlands expels turkish turkeys , only to realize shortly afterwards there were none . 
  in outrage by the lack of turkeys , protesters responded by burning the turkish flag , but it turned out to be the [ tunisian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/flag_of_tunisia.svg/2000px-flag_of_tunisia.svg.png ) one . 
  the un is a joke anyway if you ask me . 
  they might not lack motivation , but they lack any strong means to wrestle against a defiant nation , whether with armed forces ( unprofor ) or with political and economic sanctions . 
  to make matters worse , they often resort to co-operation in negotiations . 
  while that might not sound bad , [ we get shit like this ] ( https://www.unwatch.org/15032-2/ ) that makes me lose faith in the un . 
  saudi arabia has an atrocious record in human rights violations . 
  they should * not * be in the seat of the un human rights commission . 
  nothing will improve , they 'll just abuse their seat . 
  it 's like giving switzerland the position in command of the international naval trade . 
  as long as you 're not working as a representative , such as a diplomat , politician or in public office , where open show of religion is frowned upon , i.e , church and state , i understand this ban . 
  for pretty much every other job , blue and white collar work in particular , i think it 's absolutely bullshit to have a ban for this . 
   if i was a soldier there , i would have fought to death to protect those bosnians . 
  i would have probably not succeeded , but i would n't have dishonored the duties entrusted to me . 
  and i would n't have dishonored basic humanity . 
  this is exactly why it 's such a hot issue . 
  if the peacekeepers had done anything , they 'd probably all have been shot along with the civilians , nothing would 've changed .
