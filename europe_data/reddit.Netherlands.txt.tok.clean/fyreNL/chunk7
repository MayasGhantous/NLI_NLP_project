  the rationale speaks in favor of not acting at all . 
  the other hand , where one willingly signs up to become a peacekeeper and knowingly does not act to help those they should have defended is morally wrong . 
  dignity would 've spoken in the favor of this . 
  honestly , i do n't know what i would 've done in the same position . 
  i likely would have chosen the latter , but i would 've subjected my comrades to the same fate , with or without their permission or knowledge . 
  i do n't think i could do that . 
  you 've never played dota then . 
  that would make me incredibly sad . 
  [ nooooooooo !!!!,

  i kinda like ayran though . 
  no offense , but it looks like a woman in a red/white dress hanging herself from a tree . 
  that does n't give them a free pass for the iraq-iran war in the 80 's . 
  that shit was horrible . 
  apart from that , yeah i guess it 's rather accurate . 
   spain  superior economic position nigga pls . 
  just looking at the sub 's banner image triggers me . 
  besides , as long as nato exists poland will have m.a.d supporting them . 
  we dont need more nuclear weapons . 
   and of course still getting nothing in return from usa . 
  am i glad we 're in america 's sphere of influence ? 
  certainly on the trade deals and political obligations . 
  that said , that they do n't do anything for us - that 's mistaken . 
  just because much of europe ca n't be arsed having a proper military , america 's picking up the pieces . 
  besides , this is a two-way street . 
  if we had nothing to gain from it we 'd have rejected their sphere of influence already . 
  we 've already done so a bit after the disaster that was the military mission in afghanistan and iraq . 
  we 're not going to do such a thing again . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  as a brit , you should know with the amount of indian people in the uk . 
  i do n't want to pay 3 eldery off my salary for the next 25 years . 
  it is simply unmanageable . 
  because immigrants get old too , silly . 
  i did n't say we 'd get a permanent android workforce . 
  honestly i am not even anti migrant , but this is seriously short-term thinking . 
  we need long term solutions to a possible permanent problem . 
  getting migrants as a workforce wont fix it , it might for now , but if they stick around we 're back off to where we started . 
  stimulating birth rates is a serious priority really . 
  whaddya mean ? 
  i ought to believe you should get your act up . 
  like , rather today than tomorrow . 
  or maybe just acknowledge that greece would 've suffered anyway , with or without a eurozone and germany has helped out not allowing greece to tank . 
  instead of covering debts , would it be an idea the eu would invest in greece 's economic oppertunities instead ? 
  maybe the construction of ( high-tech ) industry might work if there 's any demand for it . 
  we did the same in the netherlands years ago when traditional economic oppertunities ( mining , textile and related industry mostly ) were dwindling , now we have a massive ( petro ) chemical industry , especially in the south . 
  you 're not going to be welcoming it when the young working class is going to financially support 3 elderly people on average on their salary . 
  agreed . 
  most birth rates were around or above the replacement rate before the collapse of the ussr . 
  edit : [ here 's a handy-dandy little graph . 
  ] ( https://www.google.nl/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;idim=country:cze:svk:hun&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:cze:svk:hun:blr:bgr:lva:ltu:pol:rom:rus:ukr:est&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) good news is that it 's been getting a bit better over the last few years , but birth rates are still low . 
  or we need to boost overall birth rates . 
  surely that wo n't come easy , but we 've got ta do something or else we - and specifically * us * ( considering i 'm fairly certain the average age here on this sub is between the age of 18 and 30 ) will have to carry a massive burden . 
   the average number of children per woman in saxony was 1.49 in 2010 , the highest of all german states . 
  dresden 's birth rate of 1.58 is the highest of all german cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants . 
  it 's still really , really low though . 
  goddamn germany , get your shit together . 
  italy , greece and portugal too while we 're at it . 
  i find that there 's a serious difference between wearing a heardscarf and a lack of human dignity . 
  if we were talking about a niqab on the other hand , that 'd be different . 
  edit : you guys do know that when visiting catholic and orthodox landmarks in southern europe and asia minor/west arabia require women to wear a headscarf too , right ? 
  it 's not a foreign concept or anything . 
  look , really , i get the irony here , but i sincerely believe that it 's not that big of a deal . 
  yeah , i kinda am . 
  in my defense , i try not to intimidate them , just trying to be casually oblivious to the existence of it . 
  well , he 's not wrong . 
  we 're phobic for corrupt , paternal autocratic regimes alright . 
  it is more than fair to expect foreigners to come to your country to act by your customs . 
  equally so , this should also be the other way around . 
  in-joke that needs context : german tourists often flock to the dutch coastline in summers . 
  as such , scheveningen is the most ` german ' of dutch towns . 
  well i 'll be damned , it really is . 
   `` the modern town of ifrane was established by the french administration in 1928 during the protectorate era for their administration due to its alpine climate . 
  ifrane was conceived as a `` hill station '' or colonial type of settlement . 
  it is a resort town set high up in the mountains so that europeans can find relief from the summer heat of tropical colonies . 
  ifrane is also a popular altitude training destination . '',

  not all bikes under 50 are stolen dude . 
  new bikes are n't always that expensive . 
  i just get second hand ones though , for sometimes obscenely low prices . 
  best one i ever got was for 4eu . 
  but , you know , that was n't completely a legal transaction ... 
   how are you doing , ~ ~ french part of belgium ~ ~ northern france ? 
  ftfy, 
  i come across a lot of slovenians on online gaming for some reason . 
  i just casually mention that slovenia is not even a real country . 
  they take the bait more often than not , and then i mention `` oh you mean slovakia ? '', 
  to get them really salty . 
  works every time . 
  i find it hard to believe they would be ranked above belgium . 
  like , no fucking way that american craft beers can topple belgian beer . 
  he does n't get much support from the younger generations it seems . 
  many turks i met dont like the guy , some bitterly hate him even . 
  why ? 
  finland is like your clingy , slightly psycho ex that whines about needing to have some space , but gets annoyed when you do n't give them attention at the same time . 
  holy shit , a german with humor . 
  nah ca n't be - must be a brit . 
  with all due respect , i dont think a petition from change dot org is gon na save him . 
  worth a try though , so i signed . 
  i wish you all the best tonight , and good luck !, 
  with a bit of hope this might work out .
