  all countries are red , but some are more red than others . 
  well , good thing eating a whole kapsalon is quite a challenge , so they 're usually split between 2 people . 
  many food joints also offer small servings . 
  but trust me , even a small serving 's a challenge . 
  a delicious , greasy , mouth-watering challenge . 
  as a dutchman , i kind of agree after our debacle with ukraine ... 
  even the rest of europe agrees , it seems like there 's a turkish kebab place for every 10 people in any decently-sized city . 
  [ kapsalon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kapsalon ) is love . 
  fabulous , probably . 
  that 's okay , just threaten to demolish the la chouffe , chimay and duvel breweries and everyone else will panic and beg for forgiveness . 
  ` all of a sudden ' let 's be honest , it 's not that sudden . 
  i 've seen this picture used as a meme before ... 
  the scale of the cities does n't match up really . 
  it makes amsterdam look way larger than it actually is , madrid and athens should be larger as well . 
  apart from that , cool map though !, 
  i liked [ this one better ] ( http://scottwesterfeld.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/leviathangrandmapbig.jpg ) it 's a map of europe ( based early 1900 's ) from the book series leviathan . 
  i found one hilarious where one man teaches his dog to react to the command of `` sollen wir die juden vergasen '' synonymous for `` lets take a walk outside '' . 
  of course , the dog becomes excited and energetic . 
  it 's a bit distasteful maybe , but i thought it was hilarious . 
  because they 've got wealth . 
  white south africans are n't much better off these days unless they 've got old money running in the family . 
  eu law does n't discriminate on race , so whatever ancestry , lineage or are even able to fluently speak a european language , does n't matter . 
  education and wealth are the only things that matter . 
  or a refugee status . 
  how the fuck did zanger bob only now become a meme . 
  [ i mean this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uryjmwqonxa ), 
  no more in number than the previously aforementioned english speakers . 
  same here , though i have n't been in the east . 
  was just fine in the inland though . 
  the tourists , or those attending festivals ? 
  dutch people at festivals do n't have a really good rep. 
  any volunteers to make a / r/polandball out of this ? 
  migration is more or less a result of those factors . 
  factor in how it will cause ( social ) conflict , famines and epidemics , it is somewhat concerning . 
  so how many kilometers is a distance ? 
  yeah , but it does hold like twice the hangar capacity . 
  well , we europeans already were like `` nu-uh '' and classified ourselves as our own continent instead of combining it with asia , it would be overkill to have the british isles as a separate continent do n't you think ? 
  swamp-german *, 
  that 's my first name , and it 's caused some confusion to people more than a few times . 
  agreed , otherwise we 'll get [ shit like this . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kar%c3%a1nsebes ), 
  i love that unit in wargame . 
  good shit . 
  most european armies are in no fighting shape . 
  an eu army would be more able to efficiently spend centralizing an effective force . 
  in doing so , it will also save us a lot of money , not to mention the costs of r&d . it 'll please the pacifists and militarists alike . 
  the only issue i see here is in regards to foreign intervention . 
  some countries want nothing to do with it , whereas others will . 
  ( such as the uk and polish troops in iraq ) but i 'm sure we can find a way to make that work . 
  while i agree with you on the basis of following a country 's law , this is something that 's been set in law for quite a long time . 
  effectively , these are two laws that are conflicting one another . 
  i think you were looking for / r/european and seriously , while this sub does have a relatively large amount of right-wingers holding their own opinions , it 's not the common practice to slam islam or the likes , and the mods * certainly * are n't . 
  why would n't she say that ? 
  `` i never thought i 'd die fighting side by side with a muslim turk '' `` how about side by side with a friend ? '', 
  `` da , i could do that '', 
  blade runner called , they want their stage decor back . 
  [ they 've got it covered , do n't worry ] ( http://imgur.com/udq31kh ), 
  or how the entire coastline is now filled with obscenely rich people and yachts . 
  [ it 's meant as humor , but here 's a dutch one . 
  no translation though ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fdezwgomty ), 
  shame that it 's not called futti ballo in italian . 
  `` give me 10turns to prepare '', 
  the biggest *, 
  patrolling the mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter . 
  go back to / r/murica, 
  you should try the dutch bible belt . 
  they 've got a lot in common with american sects . 
  `` mmmyes , that 's what we wanted you to think ! '', 
  ca n't remember . 
  wish i held on to it , but i put it with the other paper for recycling tbh . 
  it did n't mention gypsies . 
  it was mostly economic and political stuff close to home , had nothing to do with gypsies . 
  do n't get me wrong , it was n't a stupid pamphlet , but it was n't factually correct , and everything else was just the typical anti-eu fearmongering . 
  it was n't from geenstijl , it was a civil committee that spread them - geenstijl had nothing to do with it . 
  i honestly did n't see any spelling mistakes on mine , or at least not noticeable ones . 
  glad to hear . 
  that referendum was ridiculous . 
  i remember getting a pamphlet in my mail box with a list of ` reasons to vote no ' . 
  half of the bulletpoints listed on it were n't even factually correct . 
  not really , but the banouilles are pretty bad . 
  * usually * not . 
  it 's by no means as common , but it happens . 
  men-on-men happens more often though . 
  hell , i 've had it happen to me once and it was pretty awful . 
  no idea how you did that , over here chrome refuses to believe that the greek alphabet is n't english and does n't need translated . 
  ireland and belgium were a surprise . 
  just a random thought : with high unemployment rates , and the working class working many hours , would it work out for greece if part-time employment would be stimulated ? 
  that 's an interesting read . 
  thanks . 
  i never wished for it beforehand , but just by this statement alone i wished the russians would 've won the war against you . 
  you guys literally put marshmellows on a pizza . 
  i will not take a finnish opinion about pizza seriously . 
   beef - and pineapple-pizza leave this place !, 
  meh , it 's not all fantastic . 
  some places are fairly poor , whereas others make great doner . 
  2,50 for a small kapsalon at the deventer train station . 
  and it fills up really well too . 
  i want to try this . 
  and poutaine . 
  bossche donerpoint in den bosch ( netherlands ) is the best kebab i ever had .
