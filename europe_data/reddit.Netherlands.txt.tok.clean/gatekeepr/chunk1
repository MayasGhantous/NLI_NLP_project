[ english article here ] ( http://europe.leadstories.com/000657-breaking-dutch-weblog-claims-enough-signatures-to-force-referendum-on-eu-treaty.html ), 
  i am looking forward to the sticky containing the moderators joint statement on this matter . 
  edit : they removed this thread from r/europe, 
  has the kremlin confirmed this conversation took place ? 
  according to his instagram elton has [ spoken to ukraine president poroshenko ] ( https://scontent-fra3-1.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/e35/11849905_146668255677121_1147148959_n.jpg ) too . 
  ask him why the migrants choose sweden over denmark . 
  the next generation 's money actually, 
  first of all you are technically correct . 
  however there is this eu law called the [ dublin regulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation ) . 
  it causes asylum seekers to migrate towards the richer countries , before requesting asylum . 
   one of the principal aims of the dublin regulation is to prevent an applicant from submitting applications in multiple member states . 
  another aim is to reduce the number of `` orbiting '' asylum seekers , who are shuttled from member state to member state . 
  the country that the asylum seeker first applies for asylum is responsible for either accepting or rejecting asylum , and the seeker may not restart the process in another jurisdiction . 
  this regulation has unwanted effects : refugees will claim they unknowingly arrived in for example sweden ( i got of the boat , was put on a truck and now i am here ) southern countries , where boat refugees arrive , are closing their eyes to trafficking and border crossing , because if they grant the refugees asylum , they are stuck with them . 
  jews will claim it, 
   well , keeping them out is just too difficult australia can, 
  i think the issue is simpler , the mods do n't want to see top posts and comments disagreeing with eu policy . 
  mods are we allowed to mention immigration related topics in here ? 
  why wo n't you mods just let up and down votes determine what articles reach the top ? 
  it is in the article  `` parliament 's institutional communicators must have the ability to monitor public conversation and sentiment on the ground and in real time , to understand ` trending topics ' and have the capacity to react quickly , in a targeted and relevant manner , to join in and influence the conversation , for example , by providing facts and figures to deconstructing myths . '', 
  also i would n't dismiss this as tinfoil hat material . 
  online reputation management is big business . 
  it would not surprise me if / r/europe is ( partly ) being modded by an european union online propaganda team . 
  as you can read in [ this februari 2013 article ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/9845442/eu-to-set-up-euro-election-troll-patrol-to-tackle-eurosceptic-surge.html ) :  key to a new strategy will be `` public opinion monitoring tools '' to `` identify at an early stage whether debates of political nature among followers in social media and blogs have the potential to attract media and citizens ' interest '' . 
   justice cooke said hayes was the `` centre and hub '' of the manipulation . 
  so was he thrown under the bus ? 
  it is such a legendary scream i hope someone isolates it and i will hear it in movies, 
   kiev is trying to persuade foreign private creditors to make concessions to ukraine and to restructure $ 23 billion of its $ 70 billion debt . 
  why would the private creditors make big concessions when the eu government seems willing to bail out the ukraine ? 
  your government just sold your country, 
  looks like a proposal to split up the euro :p, 
  so after years of bailing out banks and imposing austerity this is where we are now . 
  you have n't had a proper reply on your obvious and relevant question . 
  the current situation is a result of the schengen agreement ( free travel within eu ; no border controls ) and the [ dublin regulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation ) . 
  the dublin regulation states that asylum seekers can only seek asylum in 1 country , and that this country then becomes responsible for the asylum seeker . 
  this results in ( southern ) countries closing their eyes on arrival and border crossings of illegals . 
  illegals arriving in northern eu countries will almost always declare that they were put on a truck after crossing the mediterranean and act surprised that they ended up in the uk or sweden , which then grants ( temporary ) asylum . 
  who even elected that guy in the first place ? 
   pushing european integration without a democratic mandate this has been modus operandi from the start, 
  how bad is it ? 
  are people stockpiling food ? 
  do stores still have supplies ? 
  are people protesting ? 
   calm you mean cultured, 
  i 'm actually getting used to having all this shit shoved down my throat . 
  it does n't anger me as much as it used too . 
  in case countries become poorer , will their birth rate go up again ? 
  there is no singular european culture, 
  her firstborn [ william iii of the netherlands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_iii_of_the_netherlands ) was quite a character . 
  there are persistent and substantial rumors he was infertile due to syphilis . 
  if he indeed was infertile , his successor queen wilhelmina would not carry his blood and would not be of russian royal decent . 
  thing is , the russians brutally murdered their aristocracy . 
  if there was any bloodline , it died in 1917 . 
  the dutch king however has a vacation home in greece , his neighbours are putin and george clooney . 
  if you understand dutch you can read original sources , it 's quite interesting material . 
  well our monarch and putin are [ best buddies ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gg2hzl9.jpg ) so i 'm sure it will all work out, 
  just like the eu constitution, 
  i figured it were gypsies but this makes sense too . 
  paradrop them, 
  yes it is here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drug_policy_of_the_netherlands#implications_of_international_law if i recall correctly there is also a ( eu ? ), 
  treaty ( might be one of the ones mentioned above ) that prohibits taxing cannabis . 
   never got really integrated since the government expected them to return they never got integrated because they choose not to . 
  although i personally know some exceptions . 
  is it really that bad in rome ? 
  he has pretty much the entire eu by the balls . 
  after years of not enforcing his borders he now gets payed to take back the migrants he let through . 
  i consider arguments concerning autonomy and self-governance rational . 
  you can even venture into self-sufficiency and non-interventionism and still have a rational discussion . 
   factory farming is shitty and cruel . 
  actually by increasing the scale you can improve animal well being . 
  imagine a multi-story building with a slaughterhouse on the ground floor . 
  this way the pigs wo n't have to go on transport . 
  cost reductions through scale allow giving the pigs more space and installing a proper fire control system . 
  the stories can have balconies so the pigs can go outside . 
  with a sizable operation a veterinarian can be full time employed . 
  energy can be derived from the pig 's waste products . 
  build it near a harbor and/or in an industry zone so that little nuisance will be caused since people do n't tend to live in industry zones . 
  industry zones also have good road access . 
  [ purno de purno ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuibd-sasjo ) is the best in my opinion . 
  the episode i linked has english subs . 
  this series was broadcasted as childrens television from 1989 to 1996 . 
  i do not consider the results pretty meaningless . 
  the amount of people who voted ` no ' is similar to the amount of people who voted for the winning party in our latest parliamentary election . 
  there have also been calls not to go voting in case you support the agreement so that the 30 % turnout would not be reached . 
  the 30 % turnout requirement makes evaluating the results and the validity of a referendum as a democratic instrument more difficult . 
  do n't underestimate the geopolitical implications of the eu association treaty with the ukraine . 
  russia will react once us/eu/nato troups get stationened in the ukraine , which economy is very oriented on russia . 
  if however the us/eu/nato would not interfere , it is highly unlikely tensions will develop on the ( ever expanding ) eastern border of the eu . 
  might be a pretty decent idea not to interfere with the ukraine and keep a buffer zone between russia and the american empire and it 's european vassal states . 
  the european official 's support of the coup in the ukraine was a terrible decision too . 
  it is pretty well known among the people who plan to vote ` yes ' that the ukraine officials are corrupt . 
  [ ukraine ranks as the most corrupt european county . 
  ] ( https://www.transparency.org/cpi2015 ) the yes-voters however argue that eu interference will reduce the corruption and better the situation for the population of the ukraine . 
  many people in the netherlands will vote against the association agreement because they are dissatisfied with the political process , on a national or european level . 
  the pm is trying to safe face . 
  we can change it back, 
  the article references a publication by professor ruud koopmans . 
  here you can find it in full : [ religious fundamentalism and hostility against out-groups : a comparison of muslims and christians in western europe . 
  ] ( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183x.2014.935307 ) *** abstract ***  on the basis of an original survey among native christians and muslims of turkish and moroccan origin in germany , france , the netherlands , belgium , austria and sweden , this paper investigates four research questions comparing native christians to muslim immigrants : ( 1 ) the extent of religious fundamentalism ; ( 2 ) its socio-economic determinants ; ( 3 ) whether it can be distinguished from other indicators of religiosity ; and ( 4 ) its relationship to hostility towards out-groups ( homosexuals , jews , the west , and muslims ) . 
  the results indicate that religious fundamentalist attitudes are much more widespread among sunnite muslims than among native christians , even after controlling for the different demographic and socio-economic compositions of these groups .
