  alevite muslims from turkey , by contrast , show low levels of fundamentalism , comparable to christians . 
  among both christians and muslims , strong religiosity as such is not ( among christians ) or only mildly ( among muslims ) related to hostility towards out-groups . 
  fundamentalist believers , however , show very high levels of out-group hostility , especially among muslims . 
  i heard the following about the muslim families in amsterdam from a social worker . 
  ( i will be generalizing ) . 
  the average family is large and lives in a tiny house . 
  children share rooms . 
  boys are treated like princes , while girls are expected to do household chores from a young age . 
  men call the shots . 
  conflicts are often resolved with violence . 
  there is high instance of sexual abuse . 
  there are ( open ) secrets , and many taboo subjects which are never discussed . 
  one of the reasons the youth hang around in the streets is that their homes are n't exactly a nice place . 
  `` we need a bigger haystack '', 
  let 's start our own guantanamo on greenland, 
  reminds me of a 2007 tv interview with arthur van amerongen , dutch journalist and arabist , he lived undercover in the muslim community in molenbeek for 1 year . 
  the words he then spoke pretty much made him a persona non grata among the mainstream press . 
  he foresaw the current situation in molenbeek .

   in an interview with die zeit newspaper , german interior minister thomas de maiziere said integrating new refugees could be more difficult than previous groups of migrants as up to 20 percent of them might be illiterate and could struggle to find work . 
  [ reuters ( 2 september 2015 ) ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-germany-idukkcn0r21dg20150902 )  over 80 percent of the asylum seekers recently arrived in germany have no formal qualifications , and only eight percent have a college degree , local media reported citing research by the country 's federal employment agency .

  well we do have [ the dutch army bicycle band ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo8dlbksw_w ), 
  i am familiar with the material but there are some distinctions that are often overlooked . 
  saddam wanted to switch from dollars to euros [ ( both fiat money ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiat_money ) while gadhaffi wanted african and muslim nations to join an alliance and [ switch to a gold backed currency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_gold_dinar#libya ) . 
  both plans would have threatened the stability of the dollar but gadhaffi 's plan would have had much greater economic implications .

[ ( 21-01-15 ) dutch intelligence services aivd and mivd walk on the leash of usa 's national security agency ( nsa ) and are `` extremely docile '' and seen as `` subordinates '' , says former nsa and cia employee edward snowden in an interview to volkskrant and nieuwsuur .

  it is n't about ` the right thing ' , it is about who gets to transport oil across syria . 
  the planet is overpopulated . 
  if starting a federation is the answer , split it up a northern and southern one . 
  bruxelles as capital for the northern federation containing benelux , germany and austria .

  there were the [ two mistral warships that france was building for russia ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33798102 ) . 
  the deal was signed during nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in 2011 . 
  after russia 's annexation of the krim , france , under pressure from it 's western allies , canceled the deal last year . 
   some islamic groups said that by voting for same-sex marriage , mr khan was `` selling out '' his religion . 
   mufti muhammed aslam naqshbandi bandhalev , head imam of the jamia islamia rizvia mosque in bradford , issued a fatwa against mr khan declaring that he is an `` apostate '' from islam who must `` repent before allah '' . 
  a head imam of a community of muslims in britain is making death threads to politician . 
  if all muslims were as enlightened as mr kahn there would n't be much of a problem , but most muslims are very conservative . 
  you mean the man who was the subject of a [ fatwa ] ( http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/02/18/labour-mp-sadiq-khan-receives-death-threats-for-supporting-same-sex-marriage/ ) calling for his death after he voted in favour of same-sex marriage ? 
  it is not a phobia , it is recognizing that islam is incompatible with western values . 
  they 're not stupid . 
  these migrants use social media , exchange information on facebook groups and are well aware of rules and regulations , and where they differ from country to country . 
  those who are willing to integrate will do so . 
  problem is that many migrants reject western values and culture , and adhere to their orthodox beliefs . 
  disarming the population has nothing to do with preventing terrorism . 
  it is about the state protecting itself against it 's own citizens .

  mein kampf is mostly interesting for the persons hitler mentions . 
  he praises henry ford for staying clear of jewish control . 
  in 1938 ford gets rewarded and accepts the grand cross of the german eagle , an award of the german nazi regime , predominantly given to foreign diplomats . 
  you have got it the wrong way around . 
  there are regions on this planet that have much higher population density and growth than that region can sustain because of resource distribution . 
  if that war heats up a bit we can sell weapons to the ukraine which they can pay for with the money the eu gives then as aid . 
  it will be very good for our economy . 
  no need to worry about that once we all have a microchip in our shoulder . 
  these things do get reported in the media . 
  however the individual cases do n't get translated to english that often . 
  not everyone goes to the police , although the police does have a special team of gay officers where you can report the crime . 
  many people consider reporting minor incidents futile . 
  biggest problem is that if you were to suggest that there is a pattern in these cases where 9 times out of 10 the perpetrators are second generation immigrants you are marked as a racist and the discussion is over . 
  police often has trouble finding and/or convicting the perpetrators . 
  the perpetrators often dress alike and have similar haircuts and hair color , for the victim it is hard to remember distinguishing features . 
  i also recall an incident in which the police forgot to request security cam footage of the incident from a gas station in time . 
  and another one where the perpetrator was a 17 year old from belgium and the prosecutor did not see much of a chance to get him convicted so that was the end of that . 
  here in amsterdam there are ` incidents ' . 
  pretty much every summer for the past years someone i know has been hospitalized after a gay bashing by youth from a muslim background . 
  less severe violence and random name calling is more common . 
  and then there is the weird stuff where muslim taxi drivers harass drag queens during a fare or whip out their dicks and ask to be sucked off . 
  [ this longread ] ( http://www.newenglishreview.org/nicolai_sennels/muslims_and_westerners%3a__the_psychological_differences/ ) might give some answers to your questions . 
  how much of the shift in age of death can be explained by a child mortality going down ? 
  well the nimby 's near that former runway are n't weeping they probably saw their property value increase . 
  guess this is what they call `` tyranny of the masses '' . 
  that explains it thanks, 
  you completely missed the primary reason ; family reunification laws .
