  i hope in the netherlands , it stays like this . 
  i think many of the meme/humourous pictures/jokes are a bit of culture dependant , not understood by all living on this continent . 
  i think it 's not such a good idea . 
  yes , thunderdome !, 
  i grew up with this music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=purkzlyjjls the only dutch music that sounds realy nice :d, 
  i do n't like negative bots o_o, 
  no song will ever make dutch sound nice :( the problem for me is , i ca n't hear how dutch sounds to foreigners . 
  dutch is automatically put into words , sentences and meaning when i listen to it . 
  i do n't hear sounds , but meaning . 
  but i heared from foreign people dutch sounds a bit like pigs making noise , so i do n't think any song will make it sounds nice . 
  dutch is just a terrible , ugly sounding language . 
  here is a list that tries to put diversity into data and makes it visible in a list : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_ranked_by_ethnic_and_cultural_diversity_level without a list like this , you can discuss this subject for ages , but it will always stay at the `` usa is more diverse/country xyz is more diverse '' level :( problem is also that americans use a different perception of diversity then people in european countries . 
  americans regard different colours of skin as diversity : white , black , yellow . 
  many people from european countries see different ethnicity/language as diversity . 
  because of this , every discussion about this subject will culminate into a yes/no discussion :(, 
  i think i do . 
  i listen mainly to mixes ( acidhouse , other house related music ) so i have no idea where most of the music is produced . 
  i realy do n't care as long as it sounds nice , 
  from much of the music i listen to ( acidhouse and acid in general , everything with a 303 sound in it ) i have no idea at all in which country it was produced realy . 
  but from one producer i know : legowelt . 
  here are some of his songs : [ the netherlands ] [ acid/electro ] legowelt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezfinodiqoi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ou4xxrdc30 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb-oreuorhq https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg_9ejhqg54 https://nl.reddit.com/r/acidhouse/comments/48dskc/legowelt_sark_island_acid/ ?

  i always use this dutch fitness tune : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idlisimyx04 and also non-dutch fitness music : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g22x5x49vhm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ybvp3616wc, 
  whatsapp , most people use it . 
  then you would be a refugee . 
  we are discussing immigrants here . 
  but i have my serious doubts about this one :(, 
  ok , now i am sure you are hiding behind a austrian flag . 
  a troll , so to say . 
  you try to avoid the question with a silly reply . 
  let me try it again . 
  are you realy a austrian citizen ? 
  i do have serious doubts about this , based on your uneducated reply . 
  preference does n't mean it exclude it . 
  there are many people who say america too , just like others like us or usa . 
  this is ask europe , not ask latin america o_o, 
  this is ask europe , not ask latin america o_o, 
  maybe you are right . 
  it was absolutely not my intension to be aggressive or hurtful in any way . 
  and it is . 
  when they mean the continent , they will say north america . 
  are you realy a austrian ? 
  i ca n't imagine that the education level in austria is so low that they never teached you the difference between america the country and north america the continent . 
  or did you spend your childhood in a poor 3rd world country and returned to austria at a later age ? 
  stupid . 
  the same as telling you went to africa or asia , implying that in one visit you have seen a whole continent , instead of visiting one particular country . 
  there are laws in place to make sure that immigrants are a bennefit to a country . 
  that laws were made by a democratic elected parlement - the people of the netherlands . 
  why should random individual people with no specific education or work experience in this field have a better judgement then trained and educated civil servants who follow the law made by all dutch people ? 
  immigrants want to move to the netherlands to build up a new life and work here and pay taxes to benefit dutch society . 
  we must welcome them with open arms , and let them feel part of our country by letting our ( immigration ) law be the judge . 
  not some random tom , dick and harry . 
  that is back to medi\u00ebval times . 
  i think your idea is very dangerous and negative . 
  it almost feels trumpy . 
  in the netherlands , we divide students into 3 grades : - vmbo - havo - vwo vmbo is leading towards mbo , a education for practical jobs like plummer or gardener havo is leading towards hbo , a education for middle management jobs vwo is leading towards university , a education for higher mangement jobs and r and d , etc. 
  from what i know and heared is that lille is the cultural and economic center of northern france , but is in a very poor region . 
  it is like `` a island of hope and civilisation in the middle of a sea of waste and dispair '' . 
  i work on a school as a librarian/educationer in a library/pc room . 
  my pay is good and i have no debts and some nice savings as a buffer for when big apliances ( like a washing machine , car , computer , fridge , etc ) would all get broken at once . 
  i just want to be sure i still can go to the shops and buy all of these new again at the same time . 
  i am howerver in debt with a mortgage . 
  i have repaid half of it and repay every month a fixed amount to the bank . 
  no problem with that . 
   when people run out of arguments they also tend to throw around with holier-than-thou wisdoms in order to hide the fact that they 're wrong . 
  again you try to steer away from the fact that you run out of arguments , please stay on topic . 
  ok , you are crazy :(, 
  when people run out of arguments , they tend to make a silly remark and avoid the arguments given . 
  that is what you are doing here . 
  please try to stay on topic with arguments , own arguments , not mindless parrating around what other people say please . 
  because football was invented and first played in the uk , so the first matched were matched between provinces , . 
  only later , when the sport became popular in the rest of europe , countries began to play amongst eachother . 
  because the uk had already the provincial teams , they did n't gave that up . 
  i am sure that if football would be a german invention , it would still have different bundeslander have different bundeslander/states in play ate the ec and wc , just as the uk has today . 
  you just realy compared wales and scotland with the netherlands . 
  shame yourself , you are crazy !, 
   this is complete bullshit . 
  scottish nationalism and independence are widely discussed in public in scotland and the rest of the uk . 
  but no here in these treads , that i thought were interresting because of all the nationalistc scotish here :( i was hoping that they would go indepht about there thoughtprocesses ( or the lack of it ) and how nationalism played a part in this ( was it the reason , or was there something more fundamental that would explain their views ) . 
  now i have to conclude , just on a small basis of a few people , that it must be a infuriority complex of some sorts . 
  but becuase many did n't want , or were able to ) give me a insight in their thoughtprocesses , i ca n't be sure about my conclusion . 
  i have no choice then make a interpretation a basis of a few serious answers and my own observations . 
  because this is such a taboo subject among scots , many avoided a serieus , indebt answer :( the most just shout nationalistc propaganda , without asking themselves why they say what they say . 
  it 's sad :(, 
   it is a hot topic because they have hard feelings for historical reasons , a recent referendum , present political system is n't ideal , they feel dictated by westminster , but also their mps can make life miserable for the english & welsh . 
  so it is a inferiority complex as a underlying basis for their nationalism . 
  that 's so sad . 
   not trying to poke fun at stereotypes , but are you high !? 
  please stay on topic . 
  when people do n't have any valid arguments anymore they tend to try to steer away from the topic at hand , like you are doing right now . 
  could you please react on the question i raised in my previous reply , and not trying actively to avoid it ? 
  i understand it is a taboo subject in scotland , but still very interresting . 
   every person in the uk would call england , scotland and wales countries when people run out of arguments they begin with making their statements in a bold lettertype and stop using rational arguments . 
  you use `` every person in the uk '' , which makes your statement already crazy o_o so nationalism should be the reason for calling a province a country . 
  but why are only the scotish reacting so angerly ? 
  if nationalism would be the core reason , why not also english and welsh ? 
  they do n't react like the scotish are on this subject . 
  maybe it is because of a infuriority complex : compensating for the insecurity caused by the fact that england ( with london as a capital ) is the economic and political hart of the uk , not scotland . 
  maybe the scotish persons who react like this feel small and insignificant and compensate this with irrational nationalistic behaviour ? 
  because without the anesthetizing effects of nationalism , they would have to rationaly think this over and feel the hurt and pain it would cause .
