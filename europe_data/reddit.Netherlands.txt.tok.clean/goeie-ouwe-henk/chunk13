  so it would be better to shout nationalistic rethoric to stop thought and reasoning ? 
  if scots are moreso offended by your silly remarks that scotland is a province it 's probably due to the scottish independence movement . 
  so nationalism is the reason why you keep calling your province a country o_o, 
   and football is n't the only sport we do this in most big international sports are invented in the uk , so also for them goes the football explanation . 
  it is not , i was only correcting some one in a reply . 
  and then the scotish nationalists came in . 
  i think it is very fascinating to see this , it gives a insight in the inner workings of nationalism and how people are affected by it ( they stop with rational thought , they keep replying what other people have thought them , they stop with independant thought ) . 
  i try to find out why espacially the scotish are so affected by this nationalism , the other areas in the uk seem not so much affected . 
  why is this ? 
  i tried to ask it some of the scotish people here in this tread , but they avoid the question . 
  are they afraid for the anwer ? 
  are they incapable to answer the question ? 
  is it some sort of taboo in their society ? 
  i like to find out . 
  yes , i am sure . 
  but i have raised this province question before , and it are always scotish who go bonkers , not the english , or welsh . 
  why is this ? 
  and why is my question avoided again by you ? 
  please answer my question . 
   all the people react like it is important . 
  this is not particularly scottish but it is . 
  i have raised this province question before , and it are always scotish who go bonkers , not the english , or welsh . 
  as long as they do n't call it a country , they are ok . 
   other countries are different from the netherlands ofcourse , you could also name them states , for example , or bundeslander . 
  because football was invented and first played in the uk , so the first matched were matched between provinces , . 
  only later , when the sport became popular in the rest of europe , countries began to play amongst eachother . 
  because the uk had already the provincial teams , they did n't gave that up . 
  i am sure that if football would be a german invention , it would still have different bundeslander have different bundeslander/states in play ate the ec and wc , just as the uk has today . 
  ofcourse they know how their country works o_o i am debating that scotland is a province . 
   my dear henk . 
  you are in the wrong . 
  just this one time . 
  accept it and move on !, 
   when people run out of arguments , they tend to make a silly remark and avoid the arguments given . 
  that is what yuo are doing here . 
  please try to answer my question though : why are only scotish people reacting like it is important ? 
  why is this such a hot topic/taboo among scotish people , while it is not in the rest of the uk ? 
  no it is not . 
  i will try to explain it again to you : scotland was never a colony . 
  it gave up it 's independance , and was incorpurated into the uk . 
  that never happened with our former islands . 
  our provinces however , are much more like scotland : they were never fully independant , but had great aotonomy , and gave that up to join together to form the proto-dutch country of the republic untied provinces . 
  we call these entities here in the netherlands provinces , not countries o_o a better example for the analigy with the dutch carrebean islands would be the uk territories like gibraltar , british virgin islands , etc. 
  in the dutch situation , they would be called a dependent state . 
  scotland would be called a province . 
   but why are you also avoiding my question ? 
  why are only scotish people reacting like it is important ? 
  why is this such a hot topic/taboo among scotish people , while it is not in the rest of the uk ? 
  and again you avoid it o_o why are only scotish people reacting like it is important ? 
  why is this such a hot topic/taboo among scotish people , while it is not in the rest of the uk ? 
   oh piss off please stay civilised . 
   know when to admit you 're wrong henk , this is just pathetic . 
  when people run out of arguments , they tend to make a silly remark and avoid the arguments given .

   i believe my ` qwerky ' ideas are shared by all 65 million people in the uk . 
  i can tell you that statement is a lie because it would mean uk people are one hivemind o_o you are lying !, 
  yes , ofcourse this is the defenition of a country in english , to explain why they call a province in the uk a country o_o  i 'm looking forward to visit the province of the netherlands sometime in the future . 
  i 'll make sure not to walk on cycle lanes .

   just that they are also countries in their own right now you are not rational anymore :(, 
  no they do n't . 
  they never object when i call their particular subdivision a province . 
  onlyt scotish people react like they have been stung by a bee . 
  but why are you also avoiding my question ?

   i have never heared a english person say this , only scotish people do this . 
  why are only scotish people do this ? 
  like i said before , this question gets activily avoided by scotish people all the time . 
  is this a sort of a taboo among scotish people ?
