  turkey is a poor country , and dependant on money sended and invested by turkish people who live in western europe . 
  the easier it is for turks to move to other countries , the more money is sended back to turkey itself . 
  the same mecanism is in play for other countries like morocco , romania , bulgaria , phillipines , bangla desh , etc. 
  all dirt poor countries without much of a developed national economy . 
  most of these countries depend also heavely on tourism : sunshine is their only friend o_o http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/country/home/tags/turkey http://web.worldbank.org/wbsite/external/topics/extpoverty/extpa/0,,contentmdk:20205436~menupk:435735~pagepk:148956~pipk:216618~thesitepk:430367,00.html http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/05/turkey-official-poverty-figures-corner-government.html http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/two-thirds-of-children-live-in-poverty-in-turkey-report.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=65461&amp;newscatid=341 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oastqohuhd0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muv5qlmh_ks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zkrgasdw7q http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/how-many-millions-of-people-living-in-poverty-in-turkey-.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=68172,

   most economists will tell you that immigration improves things for most people in the host country , and as a matter of principle i think we should listen to economists . 
  let 's live in a capitalist utopia : it will raise us all out of poverty !, 
   a person of some european ancestry calling himself chinese would be laughed out no matter how flawlessly he speaks the language if he would be born and raised in china and be part of chinese culture , why would he not be chinese ? 
  just because of the colour of his skin ? 
  you have a very racialy view of the world , that almost sounds racist to me : / there is a difference between being dutch ( having a dutch passport ) and being part of dutch culture . 
  there are people in the netherlands who are born and raised here and have the dutch nationality , but are outside of dutch culture and seen as second rate citizens ( turks , mocrrocans , etc ) . 
   netherlanders of 1200 bc '' are essentially the same in their `` contents '' as they are now after the romans left , the indeginous people of the netherlands at that time dissapeared . 
  it is not known if they left volenteery , were forced out , killed or were mixed with the germanic people that came to replace them ( probably of bit of all the options ) . 
  but the culture dissapeared and was replaced with a germanic culture . 
  this happened around 500 . 
  it happened both in the north of the netherlands ( where there were no romans stationed ) and in the south ( occupied roman territory ) . 
  from that moment , germanic people were settled in the netherlands . 
  for a interresting look at the movement and spread of germanic people around europe you can listen to these podcasts , they give a great insight in the history of germanic people and the languages they spoke : http://historyofenglishpodcast.com/page/9/ the germanic people came from the indo european , so it 's better to start at episode one for a good comprehention of this subject . 
  the first episodes are not constrained to the uk alone , they also are interresting for the netherlands . 
   i 'm not even an american though that makes it even more sad :( edit : for a good ( but simplified ) view on the germanic migrations : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migration_period, 
  but a very yummi local variety , 
  they are etnic dutch , just as people from zeeuws vlaanderen : they are part of the flemish community ( spread out over belgium , the netherlands and france ) but are integral part of the etnic dutch . 
  the same goes for the frisians ( and the twente people and the limburgians , etc ) . 
   yet you would make a distinction between an irish-american person and a native-american cherokee person would n't you ? 
  oh no , you are one of those `` so much % of this or that herritage '' nutters o_o that explains your comments here . 
   5000 years ago ) were predominantly germanic in their racial character please take a look at this page : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic_peoples#origins you can see there are no germanic tribes in the netherlands at around 1200 bc . 
  ( that 's 3200 years ago ) . 
  please take a look at this page : r/shitamericanssay it is defenately not a nice page , but it is full of examples of people like you who have very akward ideas about immigrants and people from other countries . 
  for a outsider , nothing will change  you are not a eu citizen now , so the brexit will not influence you directly . 
  you will be seen and treated as a us citizen eu wide . 
  they are etnic dutch ,, 
   if you have an american passport , you are cherokee . 
  after a few generations , most irish immigrants will be part of cherokee society ... am i doing this right ? 
  no idea what you are trying to imply here ??? 
   there is a huge difference between immigrants and settlers if you would read careful enough , you would see that only the first farmers and the germanic tribes were settlers , all the rest were immigrants . 
  the people the netherlands needs right now are again immigrants . 
  nobody has said anything about settlers . 
   stop pretending like netherlands is some sort of `` international airport '' you make no sence anymore . 
  serious question : are you a bit drunk at the moment ? 
  and currysauce , never forget the currysauce . 
  if you have a dutch passport , you are dutch . 
  after a few generations , most immigrants will be part of dutch society . 
  the netherlands was always a land of immigrants , they came in waves : - first wave was when people started to change from hunter-gatherers into farmers . 
  the netherlands was then a swampy area where sea routinely swallowed land area , and rivers flowed into the sea . 
  it was very furtile land , so the first immigrants ( settlers ) started to make a permanent living in the netherlands . 
  - the second wave were the romans , they came and tranformed the southern half of the netherlands directly into a border area along the rhine ( with many soldiers staying here ) and the start of the villa system ( but those where probably mainly local upper-level people adjusting to roman customs ( they were romanised ) . 
  the northern half of the netherlands stayed out of the immigration zones , but was influenced by roman goods and trade . 
  - third big wave was when the romans retreated and the people of the netherlands almost all left or dissapeared or mixed with the immigrating germanic tribes , which settled in the netherlands and which are for the most part our direct forfathers . 
  they gave our language and traditions ( this started around 500 after 0 ) - forth big wave was during the 17th centuary when the netherlands had a global empire . 
  there were not enough dutch people to act as sailors and soldiers , so many immigrants from the surrounding countries came here to settle down , also many theological refugees came here to avoid prosecution and death in their country of orrigine ( like the french hugonots and the portugeese jews and flemish protestants ) . 
  - fifth wave of immigrants was when we lost the colony of netherlands east indies ( now indonesia ) . 
  many dutch east indies people came to the netherlands , including people from islands that helped the dutch , such as molukan people . 
  - sixth big wave was when the netherlands had a economic boom starting in the late 60 's . 
  many immigrants from portugal and italy , later on from morroco and turkey . 
  - seventh wave came when suriname became independent and a lot of suriname people ( some estamates are half of the population of suriname ) came to the netherlands . 
  there will be a next wave for sure and it wil change the netherlands again o_o, 
  it is a first step towards this goal . 
  we were debating your claim , that you ca n't support with data . 
  now you try to get away from the argument because you ca n't show any data to support your claim . 
  you are a 100 % troll . 
  i ca n't take you serious anymore :(, 
   but antisemitism remained present again , not a economical argument . 
  and again , no data . 
  why are you trolling ? 
  does it give you a nice feeling ? 
   i take op 's question as `` is there currently any `` elite '' ethnic group in your country '' . 
  that is your interpretation of it , i have another one . 
   second , jews where a powerfull economic group throughout  history . 
   jews have always been dominated and disliked all over europe  for this in a previous comment , i was talking about the economic factor for jews as a whole , not other factors . 
  you still ca n't show any data to support your claim . 
  you are defenately a troll , trying to use the jews as a means to create a riot here in this tread o_o please show me i am wrong with believable data . 
  please !, 
  turkey is a poor country , and dependant on money sended and invested by turkish people who live in western europe . 
  the easier it is for turks to move to other countries , the more money is sended back to turkey itself . 
  the same mecanism is in play for other countries like morocco , romania , bulgaria , phillipines , bangla desh , etc. 
  all dirt poor countries without much of a developed national economy . 
  most of these countries depend also heavely on tourism : sunshine is their only friend o_o, 
  first , op did n't ask specificaly for current etnic groups . 
  second , jews where a powerfull economic group throughout history . 
  and third , you ca n't give any data to support your claim . 
  you are a troll . 
   jews in france ( and probably a few others , but less than a century ago ) . 
  so jews as a group were economically succesful in france , is a untrue stereotype ? 
  do you have sources or believable data to support your claim that they were not succesful ? 
  what is the escalation ? 
  not realy here in the netherlands . 
  weve got some etnic groups : moroccans , turks , armenians , antillians , surinamese , molukkans , cape verdians . 
  but these groups are much poorer then etnic dutch people ( strange to say etnic dutch btw o_o, 
  western europe as a whole has two big problems : - aging population - a shrinking population in numbers in the netherlands , we need immigration in order to make sure our population will not shrink and enough young people are there . 
  they are needed to keep the economy running , to have enough people paying taxes to keep our infrastructure and programmes payable and to make sure all the old people are taking care of .
