  so we are absolutely dependant on immigrants . 
  that said , we do n't need just any immigrant , we need immigrants that are skilled for whatever job that has been unfulfilled by a dutch person . 
  i do like the american greencard system . 
  you can choose who is immigrating . 
  so you could screen for people you do n't want to immigrate in to the netherlands . 
  for example : then you can screen for people who have a believe , and then keep them out . 
  all in order to make sure our society keeps free from any believe system whatsoever , and we keep on being a secular society o_o, 
  every year , we have a big birthday party , because our king is getting one year older : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d8rjuqvnng https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bg88hmrvuc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmwrw9d3wg4, 
  why not ? 
  and why would anybody have a opinion about it ? 
  it is just a visit from one country leader to a other country . 
  hapens all the time around the world . 
  why would this be so special ? 
  nothing positive , in the netherlands we are in a long proces of getting rid of christian influence on society . 
  a new believe would mean we would have to start this proces all over again . 
  right now , islam is a tiny minority ( i thought it was around 6 % of the population ) . 
  hopefully it stays that small , or even better , it will decline . 
  i live in a country that is democratic , peacefull and open minded and not religious . 
  what islam has to do with that ? 
  nothing i ques o_o, 
  we have a festivity during wintertime : sinterklaas sinterklaas : http://i1.wp.com/stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sinterklaas.png?resize=1400%2c700 zwarte piet ( black pete ) : http://www.hartvannederland.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/zwartepiet.jpg i have played sinterklaas once at a hospital in enschede ( the city in the netherlands were i work ) at the oncology section ( cancer patients ) . 
  it was much fun and also very depressing at the same time o_o a colleague of me was zwarte piet . 
  this site has a lot of dutch cultural habits listed http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/complete-list/, 
   by `` technically ' i meant a democratic process exists , but its controlled strictly by the two-party system with little room for independents . 
  if you go to vote , and your vote is lost because of this state-level elections , then i would n't call it even a `` technically democratic system '' . 
   what is your favorite football club ? 
  how many games do you go  to per year ? 
  do you have a favorite supporter chant ? 
  here in the netherlands , football has a social function : it gives `` paupers '' ( chavs , hillbillies ) a place to vent their anger and agrassion , and can drink loads of beer after the game . 
  it would be terrible if football clubs would dissapear , the paupers would have to drink and be agrassive somewhere else , maybe even in a place i would be bothered with these people :(, 
  wrestling is n't popular at all in the netherlands . 
  you can see it once every four years on tv during the olympic games ( if you wanted to , but almost nobody does ) , but that 's it . 
   the world rally championship is popular in europe , at least  compared to america never heared of the `` world rally championschip '' o_o, 
   `` technically '' democracy . 
  not by western european standards though o_o, 
  when you have graduated highschool , it 's tradtion to hang out the dutch flag with your schoolbag attached to it . 
  so the whole street knows the good news  http://www.rsgtrompmeesters.nl/sites/default/files/afbeeldingen/algemeen/01_nieuws/160616_vlag_geslaagd.jpg this is one of the very few moments it is socialy acceptible to put out the dutch flag . 
  this is my basic understanding : you have a two party system : democrats are rightwing , conservatives are freakishly rightwing / theocracts , one party rules in one of the 3 branches of your political system : president , lower house and upper house . 
  all of these 3 entities do have some function and power and each can stop legislation from becomming a law . 
  this makes it very difficult to govern properly when 1 or 2 entities in your two party system do n't want to cooperate . 
  also , because you have elections by state , a vote of a citizen is not a `` one man one vote '' . 
  also the way your politics is organised , there is much influence of outside entities by financing campaigns for candidates . 
  all of this makes the us political system very undemocratic , ( almost ) a dictatorship by two groups in your society . 
  i realy ca n't believe us citizens realy believe they live in a democratic country o_o how is this possible ? 
  is your own political system not a subject on your schoolprogrammes/schoolclasses ? 
  never heared of this , this is defenately not a dutch thing : i am peeing standing in front of the toilet my whole life , and i never heared any men sitting down for that o_o maybe your girlfriend is a freaky controlbitch ? 
  do n't be her slave !, 
  that 's true , whenever i cross the border with germany ( i live in almelo , the netherlands ) i can speak dutch and they will speak german , works fine o_o but i still am ashamed i do n't speak proper german though . 
  dutch would be a wrong choice , it 's useless outside of the netherlands and the northern part of belgium and suriname . 
  just learn a important language , german or english would be ok , also french and spanish are usefull . 
  but not dutch , defenately not dutch . 
  please do n't . 
  you would waste your time . 
  i can understand german perfectly , but i ca n't speak it well , only on a touristy basic level :( dutch and german are not as close as some latin languages are . 
  i think dutch is almost as closely related to english as it is to german . 
  germany is the most important economic country in the eu . 
  the netherlands is dependaant on it 's trade with germany . 
  so germany sets out the economic policy for a lot of countries , who are also dependant on their trade with germany . 
  do n't learn dutch , it has only a very small area where it is used and almost all dutch and flemish people can speak english . 
  nato is a group of countries that wants to defend itself to outside threats , first it was the warschau pact , nowadays it is not very clear who this threat is . 
  if the us would leave nato , the urge to defend itself will remain with the remaining countries , so there will come a succesor to nato , and i could imagine it would be integrated into a eu framework , maybe a european army ? 
  who knows ? 
  or nato will continue wwithout the us . 
  why not . 
  but whatever happens , it would mean new priorities because nato uses a lot of us transportation devices now . 
  i do n't understand why a leaving us would mean that war would become a serious possibility in western europe ? 
  no , but friesland has a demographic problem , i tried to explain . 
  apperantly , you do n't understand this . 
  i try again . 
  friesland is , history wise , been a bufferzone between holland and the german states/prussia/germany . 
  the core of the netherlands has always been holland , and still is . 
  holland is the place where big industry and companies are rooted and where you have to go to make a career in the netherlands . 
  many young people in friesland ( and other dutch bufferzones like limburg and zeeuws-vlaanderen ) are moving away to the western holland region for higher education and they overwelmingly stay there to persue a career and have a family there . 
  the bufferzones are loosing there young people and old people are staying behind , becomming more and more a bigger part of the demogrphic in friesland province . 
  also , the region has cheap houses , and has a lot of vollages and towns where all the hustle and bustle of big city life is abscent , making this a very atractive place for pensioners . 
  that makes friesland even more a province with older people . 
  that is not good , because young people outside of friesland will not teach their kids frisian , but english as a second language ( frisian has no use outside of friesland , english s the lingua franca that makes you connected to the rest of the world ) . 
  frisian will slowly dissapear , spoken by less and less people over time . 
  it will become a `` frisian language wasteland '' , a place where once a language was spoken , a language that has been documented and recorded , has all the rights as a second language in friesland province itself , but that after generations is only spoken by some old people who are slowly dying out and with them the frisian language . 
  it 's a sad place :( i hope this was easy enough for you to understand o_o, 
  you realy do n't want to live in friesland province . 
  it 's on the edge of dutch civilisation . 
  young people try to get away from there as soon as they finish highschool , mainly to the urban western part of the netherlands to pursue a career and to start a family http://www.confirmeonline.com.br/confirme/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jovens-felizes.jpg http://previews.123rf.com/images/luckybusiness/luckybusiness1207/luckybusiness120700273/14332327-group-of-young-people-happy-excited-smiling-friends-standing-and-holding-hands-up-stock-photo.jpg when people are retiring , some go living in friesland province because it is cheap living and is without all the hustle and bustle of modern life . 
  it is the place where people like to go to spend the end of their lives . 
  it 's a sad place :( http://www.ondertussen.nl/img/sites/ondertussen.nl/files/news/imagebig/10/09/bejaarden_wfa_nils_schoonhoven.jpg, 
  my house in almelo , the netherlands ( the city i live in ) was build in 2008 , the oldest building i will set foot in today is from 1865 ( trainstation almelo ) , so not that old also http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/16029977.jpg i work in a building from 1929 ( a former bank ) . 
  it still has the orriginal safe in it 's basement . 
  this is by far the ugliest building in almelo , the netherlands ( the city i live in ) : the old cityhall http://www.tubantia.nl/polopoly_fs/1.3950745.1376036986!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_800_600/image-3950745.jpg they build a new one , looks a lot better then the ugly old one : http://img.rtvoost.nl/t3/237615.jpg i think the most prettiest building is the castle in almelo : http://www.andrewolff.nl/fotoserie/wandelingen/huize_almelo/slides/almelo_130914_1230-4.jpg i live near it ( almost 100 meters from it , i walk along side it everyday towards work ) . 
  no such thing as a fish , from the qi elves : https://soundcloud.com/nosuchthingasafish ask historians podcast : https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/wiki/podcast big picture science : http://radio.seti.org/episodes history on fire : http://historyonfirepodcast.com/episodes/ the history of english : http://historyofenglishpodcast.com/page/9/, 
  as long as chiana would allow free access to vessels from other nations , there would be no problem for the netherlands . 
  but control over the south china sea is a unwanted situation due to the fact that they could block access . 
  that would hurt the dutch economy very hard , because the netherlands is very dependable on transferring goods and distribution via the port of rotterdam and schiphol airport and it 's system of roads and canals that connect it to it 's neighbours of germany and belgium . 
   imagine france seeing the channel up to denmark 's water as  french because paris sees it like that . 
  this argument is , for the netherlands , less important . 
  it will matter more for the countries surrounding the south china sea . 
  my first thought was : far away from the netherlands , so why would i care ? 
  but then i thought of all the ships going from china , japan , singapore , taiwan , etc through the strait of malakka and the suez canal to the port of rotterdam , and then it came to me that it is of vital interrest to the netherlands . 
  china wants to control this body of water ( shipping lanes , possible a lot of oil and fishing rights ) . 
  other countries have the same ambition , like taiwan , singapore , brumei , japan , vietnam , philippines . 
  i know all of these countries are investing hughe amounts of money in warships and subs , there is a massive build up of weaponry in south east asia .
