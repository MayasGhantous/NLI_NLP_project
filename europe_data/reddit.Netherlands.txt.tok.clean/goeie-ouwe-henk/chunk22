  and nobody thinks it 's nuts that 's exactly the taboo i was decribing : you talk about it , but nobody dares to say to you it nuts o_o, 
  still in stage one o_o, 
   i can identify that my none of my asian friends do it while my white and likely german friends do , etc. 
  but those `` german friends '' are americans too , just as you are . 
  this sounds more and more delusional as this tread is progressing o_o, 
  so it is a taboo topic , not be discussed , again you try to avoid it . 
  let 's break with taboo : is it something everybody thinks it 's nuts but nobody want 's to point out to somewhone who says he is irish-american , german-american , etc ? 
   that 's blatantly untrue stage one : denial, 
  i ca n't take you seriously anymore , you sound bitter and stupid now o_o, 
   most people , in my view at least , do n't have a worthwhile job you have a self-esteam problem . 
  every job is important , otherwise it would n't be a job . 
  you are part of a society that needs your job to be done . 
   other americans we do have things in common with but what do you have in common with these other americans , besides that you a ancestor comming from some part of the world ? 
  that would be the same as identifying with other americans who had once in their lives a pair of blue shoes . 
  it 's meaningless , hollow and sounds realy crazy to people from other countries . 
  why do you want to get away from the topic of discussion , the fact that americans identify to cultures they have nothing in common with ? 
  is this a taboo subject in us culture ? 
  is it something everybody thinks it 's nuts but nobody want 's to point out to somewhone who says he is irish-american , german-american , etc ? 
  you are right , u/adsrelease said this , he / she is the one who borders to nazi eugenics . 
  you are just delusional . 
  then why are you indentifying yourselve with a culture you have nothing in common with ? 
   someone with an irish background can be different from someone with a chinese background but you all have a american background o_o, 
   no , you sound ignorant . 
  you realy said this , i 'm not making this up : `` irish-gened americans '' . 
  that borders to nazi-eugenics . 
   your ancestors , given that your ancestors were from the  netherlands , have been there forever . 
  in the us we have a very  recent path of people immigrating  have some idioms persisted in the family which gives us at least a moment of pride for those who went a long way for us to be here ? 
  yes again : you were born in the us , you were raised in the us , your parents too , you have not lived any time in wales . 
  you are a american . 
  why do you think you are part of welsh culture ? 
  it 's such a crazy thing to say/think . 
  i have never heared this from people from other countries , it realy sounds so delusional . 
  why are you ashamed of your american culture ? 
   shared traits among them and much of the public display of  their culture is born out of having once been marginalized . 
  you were born in the us , your parents were born in the us , you were raised in the us . 
  but you identify with a other culture o_o that 's coocoo . 
  are these people ashamed to be a american ? 
  or do they want to be something else , something interresting , not as all the other normal plain americans ? 
   going to explain your objection they are human beings doing a job , just like other human beings doing their jobs . 
  they are not gods or superhero 's . 
  i never seen this obsession with this outside of the us realy , that is why i commented this as a example of a idea/custom within american culture would n't translate well into any european culture . 
  it is almost like the us is living inside it 's own us bubble , not aware of how people in other countries think and see the world around them , us citizens in general seems to be disconnected from the reality outside of their country . 
   i 'm not talking about the military or police here . 
  i 'm talking  about people who actually do worthwhile work . 
  but they do worthwhile work , just as anybody else in society . 
   an identity with other irish-gened americans so you have `` culture genes '' in the us o_o you sound realy stupid now :(, 
  it 's a prejudice from a time when the british and dutch fought wars against eachother . 
  greediness is universal , a human thing . 
  exactly , this is so normal in the us , they do n't get why this is so strange , the idea that you think you are part of a other culture while being born and raised in the us . 
  it 's almost like they do n't want to be a american . 
   i honestly do n't see what 's wrong with thanking people , like firefighters , who literally risk their lives to save others , for what they do ? 
  and again o7 you just confirmed a prejudice 3x . 
   i do n't think this is as true as seemingly most people seem to  think it is german-american , irish-american , italian-american , greek-american , etc. 
  all very normal in the us o_o, 
  greediness is universal o_o, 
   if anybody in society deserves to be thanked , it 's those who regularly save others lives . 
  i think it 's  sort of sort of simplistic , if not outright naive , to pretend like  professions like firefighting and medical stuff are `` just jobs '' . 
   very few other people have as much on the line every time they  go to work . 
  and not everyone can handle that sort of stress . 
   beyond that , they provide a genuine and incredibly worthwhile  service to humanity o7 and you are doing it again , americans just love to worship these people . 
   and now i realize you might actually have been agreeing with me no  i 'm a little drunk `` little '', 
  most dutch people have a `` basic channel '' subscription on cable tv : you get the national state tv channels and a few dutch commercial tv channels , also some channels from neighbouring countries : belgium , germany , france , uk , and some special interrest channels like euronews , cnn international , national geoghapic , eurosport , etc. 
  most young people do n't watch much tv anymore , mostly old people have a subscription on a broader package of tv channels on their cable . 
  if you want to recieve more , you can buy subscriptions on satelte tv , then you can recieve tv channels from all around the world ( and see that also in other countries tv is boring ) . 
   honestly , i think this sort of thing is overplayed/overrepresented on reddit o_o reddit is not my only source on us news  i only occasionally see military members thanked for their `` service  i would actually love to see firefighters/medical personnel thanked more regularly you are doing it here and now o7, 
   well , what 's the distribution of satellite tv like in the netherlands with a satelite dish . 
  there is a boxy thing between the dish and your tv that you can fill with subscription cards for certain satelites . 
   beyond that , just because you have satellite tv , does n't mean you get every single channel available like i said before , it depends on how much you want to pay for it . 
  because of satelite-tv distribution , everybody on the whole pleanet can recieve hundreds/thousands of tv channels , it 's just a matter of how much you want to pay for it . 
  strange question o_o, 
  o7 thank you for your service . 
  this idea of worshipping soldiers , police , firefighters , etc. 
  they are seen here in the netherlands as people who do their jobs , not as heroes . 
  this mixture of politics and religion in the us , the idea of everybody for him/herself , the workslave mentality , extreme nationalism , the idea of being part of a foreign country while you were born and raised in your own country , etc. 
  there are a lot of differences between the netherlands and the us o_o, 
  yes , it is dutch greediness in the netherlands , belgian greediness in belgium , spanish greediness in spain , etc. 
   exploring urban areas  it 's not super expensive  it 's possible to take a swim in the [ ocean/sea/lake ] . 
   it 's possible to chill on the beach . 
   you can shop but wo n't drop  something unique . 
  every country has ofcourse it 's own laws on this subject . 
  it would take far too much time and effort to look them all up and post them here o_o, 
  even then it is profitable to water it down : here in the netherlands , when you ask for a water , you get a brand of bottled water ( brands like sourcey , spa ) , so cheaper tapwater also leads to a profit for the bar/restaurant . 
  here in almelo ( the city in the netherlands where i live ) is one of the cheapest area 's for houses . 
  but 20 kolometers from almelo ( on the other side of the border with germany ) , houses are much cheaper still . 
  i ques that it depends on the availability of jobs and urbam ar\u00e9as , the places where people like to live nd can afford higher prices . 
  ice is basicaly water , so yes , every bar/cafe/restaarant loves to water down your drink for higher profits . 
  they like that the world around o_o, 
  whoow , that are realy nice houses !, 
  these houses are 50 meters from a castle , and 1 street from the historic center of almelo . 
  i quess you have to pay 3 or 4x as much if you want someething like that in amsterdam ( if even possible ) o_o, 
  around 220.000 euro 's . 
  but houses here in the east of the netherlands are cheap , in the west of the netherlands , houses are a lot more expensive . 
  my brother lives in amsterdam , on the other side of the country , and when i hear how much houses costs over there , i realy wonder if i live on the same planet o_o, 
   what is people 's problem with the selection of the european commission i have never heared someone saying : `` i have a problem with the proces of selection of the ec '' op , why do you think people have a problem with this ? 
  i used the guilder for a long time in my life , and rather liked it . 
  i know it was a deutsch mark in disguise ( the guilder was pegged to it ) , but still i liked the modern design of the guilder : http://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2012/12/8/4/6/7/46755630-239d-0130-a7cc-0050569446fe.jpg and http://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2012/12/8/4/6/0/460d67c0-239d-0130-a7cc-0050569446fe.jpg http://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2011/6/16/2/f/5/2f566cd0-7a3d-012e-a281-0050569439b1.jpg and http://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2011/6/16/3/0/2/3021aaa0-7a3d-012e-a281-0050569439b1.jpg now we have these badly designed euro 's which looks like they were designed 100 years ago :( we have been going back in time unfortunately , we have ugly money in the euro zone o_o or maybe i 'm getting old and nostalgic ... 
  a random street in almelo , the netherlands ( where i live ) : https://www.google.nl/maps/place/almelo/@52.3598061,6.6708342,3a,75y,80.22h,87.24t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1serppxzcs-kjgybldk0jvgg!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3derppxzcs-kjgybldk0jvgg%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d181.92574%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x47b80621c73bb0f5:0x754b2911047bb446!8m2!3d52.3670267!4d6.6684919!6m1!1e1 row after row , the same houses , all very tiny ( compared to us houses , but build very sturdy and with better materials . 
  almost alll houses are made out out stone and a sort of concrete slabs . 
  everything in the netherlands is central planned by the government , also the housing , it makes it very uniform throughout the country . 
  you ca n't tell where you are based on houses alone ( ofcourse in the old parts of town , there are regional differences , so does farmbuildings have ) .
