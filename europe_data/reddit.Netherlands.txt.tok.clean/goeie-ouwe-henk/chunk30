  have n't people and/or society moved on and evolved since those times long gone ? 
  castro and his movement helped cuba to free itself from being a american colony , so that 's ok . 
  he wanted to help his country to get out of poverty by implementing communism ( understandable , capitalism brought so much poverty and missery ) was ok too . 
  but then he failed to bring his country to a social-capitalistic society like so many western european countries have , that was not ok , . 
  he kept his grab on power , despite the poverty in his country and the knowledge that it would never get better under his leadership . 
  but now his brother is at the helm , and he makes the difficult adjustments now . 
  cuba was already opened up for western tourism some years ago , but now finaly also us citizens can visit cuba and leave their money behind . 
  i hope cuba can keep it 's social policies intact and earn some euro 's ( and dollars ) from tourism and trade . 
  he was our lord , so he was our leader . 
  worst dutch leader would be depending on the time and on which side you were . 
  it 's impossible to say realy . 
  any answer would be highly personal and totally biased . 
  philips ii , he was so terrible , we started a war to get rid of him .

   i 'm just unsure why the number of world cup victories matters when competing in a euro cup are you not realy a american , one that thinks he 's `` so many of a percent of greek '' ancestry o_o world cup victories always matter !, 
  good answer , i upvoted this answer so hard , realy hard . 
  it 's all a matter of history : football is a english sport , and as such they played first against other provinces in the uk first . 
  after that , they went international , but the uk kept their provincial divide also in international games . 
  i am sure that if foorball was for example a german sport in origin , there would only be one uk team , not different provincial teams . 
  yes , it 's just a matter of common sence , that 's all . 
  just be friendly , keep your voice down , do n't be a dick and do n't expect them to speak a other language fluently . 
  tl dr : basically be a friendlier version of yourself . 
  i think you do n't get it . 
  op was talking about spheres of influence , where you could say germanic was the main characteristic . 
  austria has been a german state for a long time , and belongs to the area of the german states . 
  very germanic ( and german ) . 
  why did you think the people in austria where so happy when the nazi 's came to annex them ? 
  the people of austria were happy that they finaly were admitted to the german sphere , they were finaly home with the other germans . 
   so similar and therefore confusing . 
  in german it 's deutsch . 
  germanic people moved towards the south over 2000 years ago and have merged with many other cultures and people since then and that is what we mean today with germanic people . 
  so austria is a german country ( identity ) and speaks a germanic language , but is n't `` germanic '' ? 
  no , they are dutch . 
   austria is n't a germanic country ??? 
  wa n't it austria-hungary fighting against prussia for the leading position amongst the german states ? 
  there is a german community in the east of belgium , but we do n't have that in the netherlands . 
   after having taken an interest in european politics in the last few years even here in the eu , not many people are interrested in eu politics . 
   it 's at a crossroads with other very important issues in mainland europe , including the migrant crisis and a number of insolvent states in the debt crisis ( greece there is not realy a crisis at the moment in the eu : the migrant `` crisis '' was mainly blown up a lot by the media , those tens of thousands of people are nothing compared to the 400 million inhabitants of the countries of the eu . 
  the economy of greece is much too small ( only a few procent of the eu total ) to ever become a crisis . 
   would the uk not benefit from leaving the eu to at least have more of say in the number of migrants that immigrate first , europe needs a lot of immigrants , the uk is not a acception on this . 
  we are getting a slightly shrinking population that is getting older fast . 
  we need people to sustain our economies . 
  immigration is a good thing . 
  most immigrants are internal immigrants : people who move from poor eu countries to rich countries to work there to improve their personal future . 
  they are hard working people ( for example polish people ) and pay taxes in the country they work in , they do n't `` suck up social benefits '' . 
  there are also some illegal immigrants in the eu , so also in the uk . 
  but because they are illegal , they are not entitled to social benefits . 
  the only group that en masse makes use of social benefits and are entitled to do so are the rufugees that have gotten a right to stay in the eu . 
  that are not that many people , most refugees are refused a right to stay . 
  so do n't worry about the social welfare systems in the eu , the uk in particular . 
   due to your country not having an army to ensure its sovereignty eu countries do n't see eachother anymore as a treath , but as partners : the first and main goal of the eu !, 
  no more war amongst countries on the european continent . 
  there are already combined army segments from different countries working together : i know a few : - dutch and belgium combined airforce and seaforce : https://www.defensie.nl/english/topics/international-cooperation/contents/other-countries/the-belgian-and-netherlands-navies-under-1-command - dutch and german combined armygroup : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i._german/dutch_corps it 's mainly also a matter of cost reducing goals : the army is expensive , it 's better to invest your money into better things , so reducing costs is looked on very favourable . 
   use of military force for countries that refuse to participate in the eu or eventually choose to leave you confuse the eu with the us  does this not set the stage for eventual european wars between dissident nationalist groups within countries and across states lines within the eu ? 
  nationalists are just tiny splintergroups in eu society . 
  war among eu states is almost unthinkable : our economies are very intertwined , people here hate militarism and war ( do n't forget , in the eu everybody grew up with the horrible stories about wwi and wwii ) . 
  you can put down your tin foil hat again o_o the feeling i get when i read your opening post , was that you are having your information from very scaremongering media . 
  also , try to get a good history book and try to understand why we needed a eu in the first place . 
  it did n't come into place out of thin air , it has a very long history , understanding it will make you understand why the eu members will go to almost any lenght to make it work . 
  a brexit is from a eu standpoint , 1 country less in the group . 
  for great britain , it would mean getting become a country on the outside of the european heart . 
  a country on the edge of the european continent . 
   german community of belgium , nl there is a german community in nl ? 
   germanic by language but culturally distinct from germany/austria germanic is realy the term for a group of languages . 
  to connect these languages to a certain culture is realy a random act . 
  for example : the netherlands and great britain have languages that are realy very closely related , but culturaly they are both distint different countries . 
  tl dr : language and culture are not the same , both are a product of history , but their paths did n't go the same way . 
  btw : a discussion is not a drama , it 's a discussion o_o, 
  well , join the team then :d, 
   that situation is entirely different as england is n't a nickname for the entire uk in english holland is also not the nickname for the entire country in the netherlands . 
  in the south and the east people say netherlands , holland is primaraly used by people living in the former hollaand area ( nowadays north and south holland ) . 
  to be hilarious in front of the whole world , 
  it 's hilarious indeed . 
  germany , it 's always germany . 
   `` holland '' is a commonly used , universally understood , somewhat informal reference to our entire country but it is still a nickname , it 's not the official word . 
  if i would say `` england '' for the uk , i would also be understood in the whole world , but it would still be terribly wrong . 
  same with holland and the netherlands !, 
  but it 's made in china , not made in usa . 
  that was one of the criteria that op stated in his question . 
   which is why i used an english word that describes our entire country the word is `` netherlands '' , not `` holland '' o_o, 
  no , i gow by the name of goeie-ouwe-henk . 
   varieties of sambal i ca n't live without sambal brandal : http://www.theboxofholland.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/2d12616c85881aa4f0699d4316899e1c/i/m/img_3758_conimex_sambal_bra.jpg and https://sambalshop.nu/media/catalog/product/cache/2/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/a/sambal_brandal_1.jpg and http://www.specerijenberg.nl/online/wp-content/uploads/1036.jpg and https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/bc/29/0a/bc290ad15e188788052958ea7d4634ac.jpg i put it on everything , on peanutbutter , cheese , eggs , pizza , asian foods , kroketten , spaghetti , fries , etc. 
  i use it daily , i 'm a bit of a sambaloholic o_o, 
   here in holland `` here in the netherlands '' our healthcare system is a country wide system , not a provincial or regional one . 
   much hotter hot sauce is available here much hotter hot sauce is availeble here too , but you were talking about `` premium '' brands . 
  you remebered a tread of two years ago !, 
  you have a phenomenal memory o_o, 
  if they consider themselves a country , and ( almost all of ) the rest of the world do too , then it 's a country . 
  you could debate over it 's problems and if it could survive in the long run , but for now it 's a country . 
  the same goes for south-sudan : a lot of minorities , a brutal civil war , corruption , killingsprees amongst it civil population , shortages of all kinds , almost no infrastructure , oil boycots by sudan , , inflation , etc. 
  but despite all of its problems , it 's a country proper . 
  well , there are not many products sold here that are made in the us . 
  it has been a long time since i saw `` made in the us '' on a product , exept for some food products . 
  the only thing i can think of that would be considered `` premium '' in the netherlands would be tabasco sauce http://mycouponexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dcs-153b_1z.jpg other then that i ca n't think of anything else realy . 
  there is nothing that 's comes to mind if i think of `` made in the usa '' . 
  the problem is mainly that those products are much too expensive , and made a lot cheaper in south east asia . 
  also . 
  i do n't see a lot of advertising done by us companies here in the netherlands , other then ford , microsoft and google :( ( maybe i am forgetting some companies here ) . 
  there are also some us products that are a standard here in the netherlands , like office from microsoft and google search from google . 
  but those are the industry standards , not the `` premiums '' and i am not sure if they are `` made in the usa '',
