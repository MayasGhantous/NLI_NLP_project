  me too !, 
  great city , sitting next to the rhine river in a outside bar ( with view on the rhine ) with a big glass of german beer and a little sunshine is sooo relaxing . 
  and a few streets away is a realy good bratwurst shop , 
  because the eu is much more then only the uk ? 
  and maybe because the uk could be out of the eu soon , so he could not travel and stay ( as a portugeese ) freely in the uk ? 
  please go read a historybook , because what you are saying is just nationalistic propaganda :(, 
  today you learned o_o, 
  like shooting a gun ? 
  i was talkong about the present , not the past o_o, 
  vla , that 's realy the only dutch dessert worth mentioning . 
  not as a dessert : /, 
  russia is only taking area 's that were lost during the crumbling of the soviet state ( stalin had given some russian area 's to other satelite states ) . 
  it is not taking new area 's o_o, 
  it is !, 
  kingsday is , in the morning , buying trash from people in your neighbourhood , walking around town meeting people/friends , drinking beer and eating streetfood . 
  in the evening drinking a lot more , 
  deserts are not realy a big thing in the netherlands . 
  pointing your indexfinger to your forehead means `` you 're stupid '' in dutch http://static1.hln.be/static/photo/2013/12/4/5/20130311104536/media_xll_5635640.jpg this handgestere means `` you 're smart/clever '' in the netherlands : http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/arbeider-die-een-gek-gebaar-maakt-27811879.jpg this gesture means that `` the food was very nice/good/yummi '' in the netherlands : http://us.123rf.com/450wm/novic/novic0803/novic080300163/2683689-lekker-lachen-model-met-ok-gebaar-met-goed-geconditioneerde-huid-en-de-tanden.jpg?ver=6, 
   but this is just a fear , it 's not a rational thought based on facts , because ttip is not yet implemented . 
  you see myself quoting here . 
   i want to know how people perceive things , not how they really are . 
  this was why i refered to the r/europe sub . 
  on this sub ( r/askeurope ) are ( well , most of them ) people who are commenting based on facts rather then opinions and/or feelings . 
  on r/europe you will find people who just tell you what they feel about something , not based on any thinking or rationality . 
  more a mindless horde of blobs realy , not rightwing perse, 
  it has not been released officialy , but segments of the agreement have been discussed in dutch media . 
  then it 's better to go to r/europe , there are more `` percieving people '' on that sub . 
  the ttip agreement is so vast and complicated , that i ca n't understand it properly . 
  it 's basically to complicated for me to form a opinion about . 
  what i 'm worried about is the minimum food standard : i 'm afraid that ttip will allow for subpar food standards in dutch supermarkets , allowing food producers to use ingredients imported from the us and canada , where food standards are lower then in the netherlands ( i 'm thinking for example about the use of `` pink slime https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5gu9byhqmo and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87ubmxdiyjo '' ) . 
  but this is just a fear , it 's not a rational thought based on facts , because ttip is not yet implemented . 
  if i had to leave the netherlands , i would probably feel most at home in denmark or sweden . 
  after that , i would choose germany and the northern part of belgium ( flanders ) . 
  no bias realy . 
  i 'm not from the amsterdam area , but my brother lives in this city , so i come there regurlarly . 
  it is a very small city packed with history . 
  but it 's not a museum town like venice is . 
  people live and work amids the old houses . 
  realy worth a visit . 
  it are sprinkels made out of chocolate and you sprinkel them on your bread . 
  i asumed you would have them in the us also : / http://www.deruijter.nl/media/581749/xlhagel_nieuw.png, 
  british from the outside , but orange inside , 
  not toast , just normal bread . 
  never tried cereals before . 
  i always have breakfast with bread and cheese , in the weekends i go nuts with some chocolate sprinkles on my bread , 
  so much to see !, 
  i never have heared of any person in europe who does n't have a sence of regionalism . 
  it 's basicaly a standard . 
  so to make sence of op 's question , it 's more interresting to see how you would present yourself to a foreigner . 
  otherwise the answer to op 's question would be : everone in the eu would feel rooted in the community they grew up . 
  but that is bassicaly a given for every human being o_o, 
  i think that in a foreign country , you would present yourself as dutch first , not as a ( insert random dutch regional identity ) . 
  i 'm sure it will be televised and it will be a news segment on the news . 
  but nobody will realy care . 
  so that means dutch first , then region . 
  that sounds like a solid answer to op 's question to me . 
  i interpreted the question of op as how you would present yourself to a foreigner . 
  it 's silly to say to a other dutch person that you are from the netherlands , they can hear that when you are talking . 
  i think that in a foreign country , they would present themselves as dutch first , not as a `` frisians '' . 
  i think that in a foreign country , you would present yourself as dutch first , not as a `` hagenees '' . 
  those are all people on the edge of society , they do n't fit in properly . 
  also , i think that in a foreign country , they would present themselves as dutch first , not as a `` inhabitant of their province / area '' . 
  not here in the netherlands , you are dutch first , then you could specify that with a particular region or province/city . 
  that would explain why i have never encountered them . 
  only european responses here . 
  in the netherlands , all buildings are made of brick , also new houses . 
  i have never seen a building made of wood here , so you are wrong about the new buildings made out of wood !, 
  i think you posted on the wrong sub , this is `` askeurope '' o_o, 
  no opinion realy , never had any interaction with us military people here in the netherlands . 
  i do n't know if any are stationed in my country : / i realy do n't care if they are here or not . 
  can confirm , in the netherlands it 's also like that . 
  i live 100 meters from a castle and the lord of the castle has a small zoo with raindeer ( native to the netherlands , geese who are also native and some scottish highland cows , who are not native to my country . 
  otherwise , there are no big animals here :(, 
  i live in the center of almelo , a city in the east of the netherlands . 
  getting around to visit friends or shopping , i do by walking . 
  to get to my work i first walk to the trainstation , it 's a 15 minutes walk . 
  then i take the train to enschede , the city i work ( work is near the trainstation there ) . 
  for getting to my family , i use my car . 
  they live on the other side of the netherlands , a 3 hour drive !, 
  that 's too far to do with a bus or train . 
  i use a dutch gps voice , why would i use a different one , like a flemish ? 
  when i 'm driving , i do n't want to be distacted by the voice , it must be `` not noticable '' . 
  why would i use a english voice on my gps ? 
  that 's ridiculous o_o, 
  it depends on the climate . 
  i think it is a strange question , in the us climatecontrol usage also depends on the climate in wich you are living . 
  never visited the us , but many people i know have . 
  what people tell me who visited the us is that it is a geographical varied country with cold and warm areas , and with woods and deserts . 
  the landscape is empty and there are even patches of land wich are just simply not used , left alone . 
  this is in sharp contrast to the netherlands ( where i live ) . 
  the people in the us live in urban areas with hughe areas in between those urban areas where not many people live . 
  the urban areas have a sharp contrast between rich and poor , very extreem i heared . 
  the rich live in `` gated communities '' and the poor in a sort of caravans . 
  the middle class live in wooden !, 
  houses . 
  society seems very hierarchical , poor and rich do n't mix much , seems to avoid interaction with eachother . 
  the infrastructure overall seems in a poor state , people tell me there are things that are called `` putholes '' in the roads and that you have to avoid them to keep your car from damaging . 
  also there seems to be not much maintenance done on roads , structures and grids . 
  the eastcoast seems a lot more developed and more `` like the netherlands '' then other parts of the us . 
  people who visited the us tell me that the eastcoast feels like a normal developed first world area .
