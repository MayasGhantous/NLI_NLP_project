from the article you linked :  the early anti-smoking campaign was considered a failure , and from 1933 to 1937 there was a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in germany . 
  [ 13 ] the rate of smoking in the nation increased faster even than in neighboring france , where the anti-tobacco movement was tiny and far less influential . 
  between 1932 and 1939 , per capita cigarette consumption in germany increased from 570 to 900 per year , while the corresponding numbers for france were from 570 to 630 . 
  i would n't call this successful . 
  i searched a bit on the internet and the perpetrator 's motive does n't seem to be clear . 
  apart from a lot of conspiracy theories i found [ this nos page ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/154052-terugblik-op-de-aanslag-in-apeldoorn.html ) saying that he called willem-alexander a fascist and a racist . 
  but even if we do n't know his exact motive , the fact that he targeted the royal family is already a strong indication for a political motive . 
  that one was not in alphen aan de rijn, 
   it also lacks the 2011 alphen aan den rijn mall shooting , which killed 7 . 
  this attack had no political motivation so it 's not considered terrorism . 
  this had no political motive . 
  it should be pointed out that the word ` slaaf ' is almost never used to refer to a slav in dutch . 
  we generally talk about ` slavische volkeren ' ( slavic peoples ) and usually do n't refer to people as slavs but just as russians , poles etc. 
  i just pointed it out . 
  dutch actually uses the same word for both , only the ethnic group is written with a capital s. 
  suck it finland !, 
  i looked up the mirror article and it said that not all votes in rotterdam were counted yet . 
  the following day , when all votes were counted , the websites of the dutch newspapers ad and nrc said that the vvd got 803 votes more than the pvv in rotterdam . 
   take rotterdam , for example : a city governed by pvda which has been won by pvv in the election . 
  the vvd got most votes in rotterdam . 
  i hate pennsylvania nazis . 
  i have read that in the past , the catholic south of the netherlands was disadvantaged ( i ca n't quite find the right word ) compared to the protestant north . 
  this caused resentment among the southerners towards the government in the hague , which is still around today even though the southern economy is doing better now . 
  this anti-government attitude leads many people in the south to vote for populist parties . 
  at least that 's what i read . 
  i believe it has more to do with high birth rates in conservative christian circles, 
  i think it has more to do with high birth rates among conservative christians though, 
  iceland is a lot lower than i expected . 
  i just made a translation . 
  that 's the disadvantage of link posts : you ca n't add text to them so you have to post your text in the comments . 
  translation of the article ( satire ) : the diplomatic row between the netherlands and turkey has prompted a number of angry dutch people to a remarkable protest action . 
  to show their dislike for the erdogan administration , they destroyed the moon and a number of stars yesterday . 
  the destruction of the celestial bodies refers to the turkish flag , but the turks do not seem to be impressed . 
  `` this is quite amusing , '' laughs fatih kerimoglu , netherlands-expert at the istanbul university . 
  i 'm sorry about the planetoid impacts , the shorter days and the end of solar eclipses . 
  and the fact that earth is going to spin wildly is n't fun . 
  but it 's not like this protest hits the turks in their hearts . 
  ( please let me know if i can improve this translation ), 
  many native dutch do n't vote in the dutch elections , does that make them not dutch ? 
  i 'm pretty sure there is an african-american culture that is distinct from white american culture . 
  but i think this questions is best answered by an american . 
  what 's up with the inscriptions outside the roman empire ?

  have n't seen anyone drink that in at least ten years . 
  in the netherlands , every new year 's eve a cabaret show ( essentially a comedy show with an overarching story and often a few songs ) is broadcast on television . 
  in these shows the * cabaretier * talks about what happened in the past year . 
  in 2012 the cabaretiers ( usually it 's a one man show , but 2012 was an exception ) on this show talked about how the netherlands always performed high on international rankings , yet were still always below finland . 
  at the end of the show they pretended to be the first humans going to [ mars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mars_one ) , but after landing they discovered there was a finnish guy already there . 
  hating poles was the thing a few years ago . 
  it 's all about romanians and bulgarians now . 
  since pis won and poland refused to take in refugees , the populist right is suddenly much more positive about the polish people .

  can someone explain why the price is n't higher in prague ? 
  i get the value of their currency plays a role , but the czechs drink the most beer of all nations and tourists drink a lot too : would n't this demand drive the price up ? 
  yes but not european . 
  just like siberians are not european . 
   no other country in europe was ever so close to us slovakia ?

  mezzo mix tastes more like cola than like fanta though, 
  if it were all of romania , there would be 2,2 billion romanians . 
  most indo 's ( mixed-race indonesians , far more common than full-blooded ones ) are mostly christian or atheist like other dutch . 
  they were legally considered dutch in colonial times ( not all of them , but those that were n't stayed in indonesia . 
  it 's a complicated story ) . 
  full blood indonesians are mostly christians from the moluccan islands . 
  de sjaak, 
  he is real and actually mentally disabled . 
  i would add that after completing vmbo/mavo or havo , it 's possible to `` move up a level '' under certain conditions . 
  so after vmbo or mavo you can follow the last 2 years of havo , and after havo you can follow the last 2 years of vwo . 
  you ca n't really compare second-generation muslims in france to the 30th ( or whatever ) generation living in bulgaria . 
  second-generation immigrants often still have significant ties to their parent 's country . 
   very few of us know that it is coming from yiddish and tells about life difficulties of jew people in s.s.c.b. 
  no it 's about a rabbi who gets happy ( probably with the help of some alcohol ) and invites two fiddlers , two [ cymbalists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cimbalom ) and two drummers to play for him .

  yes , yiddish . 
  how did the song get known in turkey ?
