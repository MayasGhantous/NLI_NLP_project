  i always thought it was much higher in south korea . 
  `` gooi dit niet weg '' means `` do n't throw this away . '', 
  before i made this account i already had had multiple reddit accounts , which i always deleted after a relatively short period . 
  but at the beginning of this year i decided to make a definitive account that i would n't ever throw away . 
  in some yiddish dialects they say u instead of o. 
  in dutch , meer means lake and zee means sea . 
  in german , meer means sea and see means lake . 
  has the word russ anything to do with russia ? 
  not much , although they seem to be more okay with poles since pis won the absolute majority and poland protested against the eu refugee quota . 
  a couple old ones : [ goodnight , mister president ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkymqbnxilk ) . 
  this song sarcastically tells president johnson not to think about all the innocent victims in the vietnam war . 
   do n't get too scared when in your dreams  you see all those innocent people  that died there at the fighting  and ask you how long this has to go on [ over the wall ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rar6xkhfxy0 ) . 
  this song talks about the division of berlin and the flaws of both communism and capitalism . 
   and only the birds fly from east to west berlin  they do n't get recalled and do n't get shot down  over the wall , over the iron curtain  because sometimes they want to be in the west , and sometimes in the east, 
  everything regulated . 
  then i 'd at least know what i have to do to stay safe . 
  you posted the same song twice, 
  / u/thedatim gives the best explanation imo . 
  i must add that serbs refers to the ethnicity while serbians means inhabitants of serbia . 
  the term babyboomer has often been used here to refer to people who were born in the first years after ww2 , so from 1945 until the early 50s . 
  the last years i suddenly read everywhere that the babyboom generation lasted until 1964 , but i still ca n't see people born in the early sixties as belonging to the same generation as people born just a after ww2 .

  was n't sweden where one of the green party politicians supported the grey wolves ( turkish ultranationalists in case you do n't know about them ) ? 
  which country, 
   `` we are n't like the rest of them !, 
  i know how to manage a company , i 'll manage a country ! '', 
  - currently in the governing coalition , corruption scandals , conflict of interest scandals why does this sound so oddly familiar since january 20th ? 
  wilders is part indonesian too and he is 1,95,

  * spanjool,

  yes i meant the northwest, 
  i always ( well , sometimes ) hear bad things about saarland . 
  any truth to this ? 
  the northwest was my first impression of czechy , after crossing the border from former east germany . 
  one of my fellow travelers described it like this : `` it looks like austria but * fucking poor * . '', 
  edit : northwest not northeast, 
  perkele is actually the name of a god ? 
  we did it for a few weeks in the pe lessons in my high school . 
  after having learned all ( or at least enough of ) the rules and techniques , we played our first game . 
  we spent about half of the time trying to figure out what we were supposed to do again . 
  ftfy, 
  nice colors , but because i have seen it so many times on products , advertising etc. 
  i ca n't really see it as the serious symbol of a country . 
  in my mind i associate it more as a logo than as a national symbol . 
  you guys liberated my country, 
  no russians ? 
  netherlands , in case you were wondering . 
   [ one of fabrique nationale 's handguns , a model 1910 semi-automatic pistol in 9 \u00d7 17mm ( .380 acp ) ( serial number 19074 ) was one of four weapons that were taken from the assassins of archduke franz ferdinand of austria , although it is unknown which of the four weapons actually fired the fatal round .

  it is an old germanic tradition celebrating the arrival of summer , and as such fertility . 
  hence it is a giant ~ ~ phallus ~ ~ upvote . 
  they do n't have snickers in germany ? 
  in most countries conservative/religious people are more nationalistic , so they would be more likely to get offended if you confront them with touchy subjects in their country 's history . 
   why moldavian ? 
  [ moldovan flag ] ( https://static.reisgraag.nl/images/cached/gs-69b5f-vlag_moldavie.png ) [ andorran flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/flag_of_andorra.svg/2000px-flag_of_andorra.svg.png ) the flair is too small to see what kind of symbol the flag has , and i did n't know what the andorran flag looked like . 
  why is the show called poland ? 
  on an unrelated note : i just saw that your flair is andorra . 
  until now i thought it was moldova and you were a moldovan immigrant in catalonia . 
   masakr ( massacre )  krut\u00fd ( cruel ) i wonder why negative words are used positively in the slang of so many languages . 
  in dutch it only means horny . 
  i remember feeling really uncomfortable when i first went to germany and a guy told me that my coat looked really ` geil ' . 
  the province of limburg is practically half flemish in culture . 
  the other half is german . 
   i do n't see what 's wrong with `` the czech republic '' well you can only use it for the modern-day country , not for the area in earlier periods when there was no such republic . 
  you can travel to neighboring countries relatively easy by car or train . 
  * the usa because i want to know what it 's * actually * like , not only what i see in the media .

  conflicting username . 
  first monday . 
  apparently other countries do n't test their air sirens every month . 
  i was taught american history in the second grade of high school ( when the students are 13 or 14 years old ) . 
  it started with the first colonization ( not only british but also spanish , french and dutch were briefly mentioned ) and ended with the civil war . 
  in other years we only learnt about the american influence on international history : ww1 , roaring twenties/great depression , ww2 , cold war and a little bit about the war on terror . 
  for the non-dutch people : the subjects of the history exam curriculum are different each year here . 
  this year it will be about the dutch republic , the enlightenment + democratic revolutions , germany from 1871 to 1945 and the cold war . 
   we had no trouble kicking you out you mean [ the french saving you from a crushing defeat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten_days%27_campaign#the_military_campaign ) ? 
   i 'd even venture to say gun ownership is above average here people have more guns in the bible belt ? 
  most likely a literal translation of bijgeloof ( superstition ),

  if the dutch army can beat them , something must have gone terribly wrong .

  the dutch wikipedia calls them [ p\u00e8re ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexandre_dumas_p\u00e8re ) and [ fils ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexandre_dumas_fils ) . 
  but the father is much more famous than the son so he is often referred as just alexandre dumas . 
   lots of people seem to be 2 seconds away from throwing punches . 
  during the whole `` dutch are fascist '' - crap last month i came to the conclusion of what 's the biggest difference between dutch and turkish culture : it seems to be a turkish cultural treat to make a big deal out of everything , while dutch culture is practically the opposite . 
  when erdo called us fascists he most likely thought that we would completely lose our shit , but we were just like `` what an idiot , now what 's for dinner ? '', 
  when you bring up [ zwarte piet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwarte_piet ) , however , our culture of not giving a shit immediately goes out of the window . 
  last week i went to a show of an islamist comedian . 
  believe me , it was a blast .
