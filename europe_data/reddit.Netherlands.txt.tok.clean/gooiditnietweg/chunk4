  the reason people deny the holocaust is not that the holocaust showed the nazis were evil . 
  they deny the holocaust because it showed the jews were powerless . 
  the fact that the jews could n't prevent the holocaust from happening does n't fit really well into the ` jews secretly control everything ' - narrative . 
  / u/rgbpeter already mentioned turks with phone repair stores . 
  we also have many snackbars run by chinese and pizzerias owned by turks . 
   there are very long queues after they put some security measures . 
  when where those introduced ? 
  i went there a year ago and do n't remember long queues . 
  you guys even practically [ composed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdtluywupds ) ( relevant part at 0:59 ) their [ anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn_qj2kn74w ),

  the period from the end of ww1 until about 1950 is really interesting to me , because it was still old fashioned but at the same time already modern in many ways . 
  for example many people , especially in the countryside , still used horses for transport but there were also already cars . 
   i do think it should be gender neutral which it currently is n't . 
  [ it will be gender neutral from next year on ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2159830-militaire-dienstplicht-nu-ook-voor-vrouwen.html ), 
  because ` amstelveen ' is n't english anyway . 
  i was thinking about english-speaking redditors who might pronounce amstelveen in the english way . 
   amstelveen is ghetto city never been to amstelveen ( this does n't rhyme in dutch btw ) but i never heard about it as a ` ghetto ' city . 
  more as an ` old people city . ', 
  it 's really weird how completely absent the baltic states are from our consciousness . 
  we do n't even have stereotypes about them . 
  in both maps . 
  why is austria central european according to you but germany is n't ? 
  in contrast to the others in this thread i personally do n't consider the german-speaking countries to be central european . 
  for me central europe consists of countries that have both significant eastern european and significant western influence . 
  as far as my knowledge knows this includes poland , czechy ( the polish name just sounds so cute ) , slovakia , hungary , slovenia and croatia ( croatia is catholic , was ruled by austria-hungary and there was much italian influence in dalmatia ) . 
  the baltic states are on the borderline between being central european ( catholicism and protestantism are the predominant religions , the region was long ruled by scandinavians and [ germans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_germans ) and estonian is related to finnish ) and eastern european ( russian/soviet rule and russian minorities ) . 
  the only eastern european influences in germany that i know of are the communist legacy in the east , a [ story i happened to read in elementary school ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krabat ) and some surnames that end in ski or owitz . 
  i believe the situation in austria is the same , and switzerland never had any ties with eastern europe . 
  people still drink buttermilk ? 
  geert wilders has advocated for a merger between the netherlands and flanders .

  the only americans i ever met were distant family members who had emigrated from nl . 
  so i do n't have enough experience with americans to answer this question . 
  i do n't know if it represents the general dutch view of americans , but a year ago my school 's civics textbook contained a paragraph explaining the differences between dutch and american society . 
  one of the sentences literally said something in the spirit of : `` americans are generally friendly and helpful people . '', 
  so we literally learn in school about how friendly and helpful you guys are . 
  : i never worked from that textbook , because i had already completed civics at my former high school ( it 's difficult to understand if you are n't familiar with the dutch school system ) . 
   where does that friendship come from ? 
  carpathians so hungary could n't invade poland . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainbow_flag_ ( lgbt_movement )  in 1979 the flag was modified again . 
  when hung vertically from the lamp posts of san francisco 's market street , the center stripe was obscured by the post itself . 
  changing the flag design to one with an even number of stripes was the easiest way to rectify this , so the turquoise stripe was dropped , which resulted in a six stripe version of the flag -- red , orange , yellow , green , blue , and violet . 
  i learnt it as red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , violet . 
  but in daily life nobody ever talks about indigo and violet so we generally just say red , orange , yellow , green , blue , purple . 
   but it was later revealed he was never in america he went to the us in 1908 , but this was years after having written his western books and he never got further west than buffalo , ny . 
   the multicolored ones though ... not so much . 
  you mean [ vruchtenhagel ] ( https://www.heimweewinkel.nl/lay/media/producten/023019-de-ruijter-vruchtenhagel.jpg ) ? 
  i agree with you on that . 
  [ bosvruchtenhagel ] ( http://www.appiehein.com/268-1120-thickbox/bosvruchtenhagel.jpg ) is much better . 
   chocolate is perfectly fine on rolls or sliced bread damn , i thought we were unique with our [ hagelslag ] ( http://www.derit.nl/wp-content/uploads/hr-_hagel-melk.jpg ), 
   kabanosy from polish shop kabanosy are polish ? 
  i always thought they were greek . 
  i remember learning in high school that before voting on a law , mp 's have the right to propose amendments . 
  these amendments are then discussed and voted on before the second chamber can pass the law . 
  the procedure is actually somewhat more complex , but i do n't remember the details and do n't have the time to search for the exact procedure . 
  the great majority of second-generation migrants often visit their parents country . 
  so you would n't often see one who has never been to their parent 's country , except maybe children of refugees who ca n't go there because there is still a war . 
  edit : second-generation , not second-migration, 
  depends on which country they feel most connected with . 
  to me they are dutch when they identify themselves with the netherlands rather than with their parents country . 
  i assume the three choices would be joining serbia , joining albania and independence . 
  what would happen if none of these options gets more than 2/3 of the vote ? 
  and why does it have to be 2/3 , and not just 50 % ? 
   the plebiscite will decide what areas go to where . 
  you mean that the parts of kosovo where the majority votes against joining albania , will become part of serbia ? 
  in this case , what would happen if this created serbian enclaves inside albanian kosovo ? 
  i believe that if this is implemented , bosnians in srpska should be given the opportunity to go to bosnia , and serbians from kosovo should get the opportunity to move to serbia . 
  also [ north kosovo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_kosovo ) should be annexed by serbia , while giving the albanians who live there the opportunity to go to albanian kosovo . 
   sirloin with cream sauce and dumplings what are those white cubes inside the meat ? 
  do you mean those locks on bridges ? 
  i once read that those originated in a city somewhere in serbia , but i have forgotten where i read that . 
   peddlers trying to sell lighters and assorted junk on the street i always thought only touristy areas had those people trying to sell you crap . 
  where do you live ? 
  expected a cover , was disappointed because lil kleine and ronnie flex do n't have a german accent . 
  maybe because france does n't collect ethnic statistics . 
  this must sound ridiculous to somebody who does n't speak dutch . 
   i believe that the uk has the biggest black population in europe so that 's no real surprise . 
  i think france has more . 
  look at the name of this sub . 
   and if its true , then why is n't the german government doing anything about it ? 
  of course this is far from a desirable situation , but i have heard that it also keeps turkish muslims away from isis-style extremism . 
   people there are traditionally catholic but pretty irreligious today . 
  they have many regional identities and speak various dialects , most of which are practically dead today . 
  they have a reputation of being able to enjoy their life and they love their carnival . 
  apart from the dialects being dead , this is a perfect description of the neighboring dutch province of [ limburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limburg_ ( netherlands \\ ) ), 
  it just stayed under british control . 
  dammit , there goes our cover . 
   spain would have sided with the allies with the risk of german occupation , which could have given the germans access to gibraltar .

  i think ` western culture ' would be a better word . 
  i feel the culture of my country has more in common with american culture than with russian culture , for example .
