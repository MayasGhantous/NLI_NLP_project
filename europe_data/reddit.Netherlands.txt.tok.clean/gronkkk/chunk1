that was what i was saying . 
   `` perpetual neutrality '' was the condition for the soviet union ( and the rest of the allies ) to actually , vienna would be [ nuked ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_days_to_the_river_rhine ) in one of the soviet defense scenarios . 
  . . and new missiles for buk . 
  old ones are gone . 
  that depends very much on location . 
  friend of me is living somewhere in the inlands of portugal and gets his internet by a usb internet stick , with a max rate of 300kb/s . 
  if it 's up . 
  about expectations : i 've visited poland somewhere in 2005 , and was surprised by the cars over there -- cars were usually bigger and newer over there than in the netherlands . 
  nothing at all like the ` lada paradise ' you ` ld expect from a former eastern block country , even as it was 15 years after 1989 . 
  what !, 
  no queues ? 
  this must be soviet propaganda !, 
  shale gas is a temporary solution . 
  you get two , three years before the inevitable crunch happens , only now you have polluted you drinking water . 
  i guess that would have to be negotiated . 
  scottish independency would keep politicians and civil servants busy for years ;-), 
  the real nugget is here :  britain [ . . ] has already warned that an independent scotland would have to leave the pound . 
  which makes sense , of course.you ca n't be independent and not have a central bank . 
  so you need a ` central bank of scotland ' , with either its own currency , a scottish pound , or adopt either the sterling or euro . 
  sterling is not an option according to london ; the scottish pound would be ok , if there was n't rbs with its debt overhang way above scottish gdp . 
  and i 'll bet that downing street would very much like to pass that hot potatoe to the scots . 
  so an independent scotland would have to join the euro , but i wonder whether everyone would become happy from that ... 
   rumour has it that spain has more diplomats in paris than in the whole of asia . 
  politics , do you understand it ? 
  to riga it is , then . 
  international wrestling fund ? 
  most of germany could be on utc too . 
  people forget that the cost of solar is not only in the panels , but that currently , for small-scale installations , a significant portion of the full installation price is the cost of the inverter and installation . 
  actually , ` trouw ' is usually a decent newspaper ( christian/dutch reformed church-oriented , so it 's not really committed to the rah rah muslims everywhere-crowd ) , but there are one or two journalists connected to that paper who write pieces that would n't differ from a daily-mail article . 
  it is n't . 
  trouw ( the paper where the ` muslim triangle ' - article in was published ) has had earlier cases of similarly bad reporting on immigration/integration issues . 
  inventing something is one thing . 
  putting it to use is another . 
  maybe even the [ dutch vvd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos_van_rey ) could take romania as an example :d, 
  bank teller : ` this is a picture of money . 
  can you go now ? ', 
  actually , they also drive 150 in the right lane . 
  that 's because in the left lane you end up with an audi driving 180 up your back . 
  of course , you always have stupid dutchmen who insist that they should adhere to the local speed limit ( 120/130 ) * and * have the right clog up the left lane like they 're used to in the netherlands . 
  events happened outside the netherlands during wwii ? 
  heresy !, 
  duh , basically everything after wwii is skipped in class , basically ` because you probably already have learned about that from the newspapers ' . 
  the loss of colonies by the european powers was discussed in my class , but korea , vietnam , ` domino theory ' , the foundation of israel , the cold war and the hippie movement was not considered ` required knowledge ' . 
  broad question . 
  what exactly do you mean ? 
  the netherlands : we like to tell each other that every single dutch citizen hid jews in his cellar and was a member of the underground resistance fighting the awfull nazis , apart from a small bunch of criminals who openly collaborated with the germans . 
  also , we do n't like to be reminded of the fact that our carefully maintained muncipal population registers ( which included religion ) made it very easy for the germans to single out the jews . 
  we also do n't like to be reminded that dutch government/dutch police was quite cooperative ( to the point that the president of then-dutch railways asked the government in exile what they should do about the ongoing deportations . 
  answer : [ ` nothing , continue with it ' ( dutch link ) ] ( http://gerard45.bloggertje.nl/note/58212/deportaties-naar-westerbork-moesten-doorgaan-van.html ) . ), 
  almere/zoetermeer/nieuwegein are exchangable to me : cheaply built ` sleeper cities ' with no history/city centre . 
  almere , the netherlands . 
  closely followed by zoetermeer . 
  ah , makes more sense . 
  and the whole thing is absurd , but you just ca n't stop politics . 
  yeah , it 's a much better solution to plaster your front window with toll stickers for every country you ride through . 
  related : a european motorway tax would imo be a better solution for the pkw-maut . 
  no , most japanese debt is ( indirectly ) hold by citizens of japan . 
  hrm , when i was in paris ( of all places ) , english was just as acceptable as french . 
  waitresses ( it appeared to me to that there were a lot of british students working a summer job in paris ) were just as fluent in english as in french . 
  german was sort-of an accepted third language . 
  ditto in frankfurt/berlin : you can get around with ` european english ' . 
  the ecb being in frankfurt helps a lot , of course . 
  but even in the smaller german towns you could fall back to english if you could n't express yourself in german . 
  the same holds for portugal/spain : the accepted ` esperanto ' is english . 
  [ same thing in the netherlands ] ( http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1014/bizar/article/detail/3457369/2013/06/12/werkloze-straatveger-moet-voor-uitkering-straten-vegen.dhtml?cw_agreed=1 ), 
  unless you want to die from boredom . 
  european motorway tax . 
  soon all the other countries will do the same , so you would end up with this situation anyway . 
  added bonus : your windshield is kept clutter-free from all the stickers you need for every country . 
  hell , i could even see that the eu might aid in constructing international/multiple country-spanning highways . 
  [ joachim gauck ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joachim_gauck ) seems to [ disagree ] ( http://www.dw.de/german-president-gauck-raises-prospect-of-world-war-two-reparations-for-greece/a-18424011 ) with you . 
  that 's for something different :  the total under negotiation was 16 billion marks of debt resulting from the treaty of versailles after world war i which had not been paid in the 1930s where greece is balking about , is on ( iirc ) 500 million of loans they had to give to the nazi regime in wo-ii , which they never got back , plus the complete destruction of a village by the nazi 's . 
  interest on interest for 70 years makes this a large sum . 
  ukranians have live exercises with russians for about a year now . 
   printing 60.000.000.000 euro every month , b they do n't print money . 
  m1/m2/m3-figures are actually going down in the eu . 
  please do n't do this . 
  exactly . 
  you see the same thing with financial crises : people forget why regulation was needed , ` red tape ' gets cut , and 20 years later shit goes down the drain . 
  i hope i do n't live to see the genocides from ww3 . 
  shit is an awful lot more efficient compared to ww2 . 
   and i doubt there will be a pan european army setting up bases in greece anytime soon . 
  greece is pretty close to ukraine ... of course , romania or poland would be better ( and i guess poland would certainly welcome it . . ), 
  but it 's not the netherlands !, 
  renewable energy is for stiiinkin ' hippies !, 
  we 'll just build higher dikes and put our fingers in the dikes ( ha , ha , we made us a joke ) . 
  / o god , we 're doomed . 
  can i still emigrate to switzerland before it 's too expensive ? 
  not only the neocons . 
  dutch vvd ` ers ( centre-right liberals ) also think austerity and balanced budgets even during crisis are the best thing since sliced bread . 
  one of the things that has n't been tried is ` replace greek/portugese/spanish bureaucracy with european one ' . 
  yes , that too will show signs of corruption , but most likely far less than the current greek government . 
  also : the traditional family had the male working outside , and the wife available during business hours for shopping and stuff . 
  and then have all the problems that the bigger subreddits suffer ? 
   thomas mazetti , co-founder of studio total , which organized the july 4 toy drop , says he received the e-mailed summons saturday . 
  it demands that he and two colleagues appear before the kgb within 10 days , threatening them with `` fines or two years of correctional work '' if they do n't show up . 
   the team has not decided if it will go . 
  ` yeah , i do n't know whether i 'll accept your offer to stand trial and be sent off to the gulag . 
  let me think about it . ', 
  mining was n't something special for the north .
