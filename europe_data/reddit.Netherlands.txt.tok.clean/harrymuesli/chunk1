yeah that 's that last paragraph . 
  my bad for assuming it also meant the 2000 euro demand was off the table . 
  ran it through google translate and indeed it does n't say that . 
  well my german is a bit rusty , but i assumed that the last sentence meant everything was fine again . 
  one could also argue he returned to his country of birth as soon as its internal violence subsided . 
  demanded . 
  after a hearty talk they gave up both their demands and their hunger strike already . 
  i would vote yes . 
  the more the merrier !, 
  sad but not surprising . 
  this exact thing happened two days ago in croatia too . 
  [ dutch source ] ( http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/09/20/opvanglocatie-voor-vluchtelingen-in-duitsland-in-brand-gestoken ) * `` it 's not the first time a refugee center has been set ablaze in badem-w\u00fcrttemberg . 
  in august , an empty building in weissach im tal was largely destroyed by fire . 
  refugees would have been sent there too . 
  * * shortly after , a gymnasium in nauen , west of berlin , was also set ablaze . 
  ( ... ) the far right was immediately blamed for the fire in nauen . 
  in the weeks before the attack , members of the far right npd party stuck stickers and threw paint bombs on the local party offices of the socialist and left parties , which were in favor of the refugee center . 
  * `` during the night , unknown persons lit a refugee center on fire . 
  two people were injured . 
  ( ... ) * * in the town of wertheim , badem-w\u00fcrttemberg , an arson attack on a planned shelter for refugees reportedly took place during the night . 
  * * `` the fire started in a gymnasium during the night '' , the police told early in the morning . 
  firemen came and put the fire out . 
  * * the gymnasium can not be entered at the moment due to fire damage , said the heilbronn police . 
  no people were at the gymnasium during the time it was ablaze . 
  two employees of a neighboring nursing home have been sent to a clinic because of suspected smoke intoxication . 
  more details will follow on a press conference later this morning . 
  that danish government 's `` stay away ! '', 
  ad in lebanese newspapers -- priceless . 
  ( around 03:00 ), 
  * `` instead of honestly making provision for the immigrants , it sent them straight to hungary . 
  what kind of european solidarity is this , '' szijjarto asked at a press conference in his home town of dunakeszi , adding that hungary would speed the building of a fence `` where necessary '' along its croatian border . 
  * * `` once again , hungary has been left in the lurch , '' he said . 
  `` we will defend the european union , the borders of the schengen zone , and we will defend hungary in accordance with european rules . 
  apparently the initial number is 500 reservists , just read that elsewhere . 
  very fence . 
  second that . 
  all the best . 
  at least they finished their croatian border fence already . 
  travajo , si ? '', 
  very shock . 
  much surprise . 
  that 's disturbing . 
  if you 're ever in holland ( province of utrecht , right bam smack in the center ) , you can always send me a message :p, 
   harmica do you happen to have a source for that ? 
  ca n't find it unfortunately . 
  bringing weed has made me numerous friends among local berliners many times . 
  [ croatia says hungary has agreed to let vulnerable migrants in . 
  hungarian gvt spokesman : `` that is not true . 
  we have never reached such an agreement . 
  we would like to ask the croatian government to stop spreading lies . 
  '' ] ( http://www.dailystar.com.lb/news/world/2015/sep-18/315841-croatia-says-hungary-has-agreed-to-let-vulnerable-migrants-in.ashx ), 
  yep . 
  it 's like watching a game of `` who gets the refugees now '' sprinkled with well-meant but unfounded and ill-thought through humanitarian speeches , with a dash of hypocritical condemnation of neighbors and a whole lot of freaking out once the actual problem arrives . 
  a bit like croatia 's shift in the past two days . 
  `` oh wait , shit ! '', 
  `` that 's enough !, 
  send 'em back to hungary ! '', 
  it appears that slovenia , realizing it 's way too small to really do anything about this , just went ahead and talked to germany and austria , while hungary and croatia are bashing each other 's skulls in over the refugees themselves . 
  yeah , it is , which is why half of europe wants federalization ( with a real , powerful , europe-wide government ) and the other half says that wo n't ever happen and the whole eu idea has failed miserably . 
  be happy you just have the house , senate , supreme court and state gvt 's and one different language ( i.e. 
  spanish ) to worry about :p, 
  i guess you 're right . 
  as long as economic migrants still have the idea that they , too , in addition to ` real ' political refugees , can come to europe without much hassle to get better-paying jobs , ` share the wealth ' , etc. , no fence or navy patrols will stop the influx of more migrants . 
  the only real way to stop it is enforcing very strict eu-wide immigration policies . 
  well , the socialists/liberals/etc . 
  are united in large parties in the european parliament , but still , they are internally divided -- east/west , north/south , on a range of different matters . 
  and even if they got together and all agreed , there are many eu-wide governing bodies and political powerhouses that need to agree too : european parliament , european commission , council of ministers , etc. 
  then if they all agree as well , the european court of justice has to okay it and 28 or more national parliaments have to be prodded too , and then the provincial/local state gvts ... plus translating all that legislation in two dozen official eu languages ... 
  it 's a bitch . 
  and romania i guess , if you only count the hungarian brethren in transylvania . 
  we know these people are gon na keep us busy during the coming months . 
  i mean , winter * is * coming ... 
  this is a rather low estimate . 
  i suspect [ one hundred billion . 
  ] ( http://www.gamesparks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/100-billion.jpg ), 
  dutch here . 
  it looks legit . 
  it uses cbs ( national governmental statistics bureau ) data and looks like an anp article ( national press agency ) . 
  do they have any idea when that fence will be finished ? 
  i mean , there might be tens of thousands of others which might have to be moved across the country before that fence is up . 
  did n't the hungarians introduce severe punishments for entering the country haphazardly ? 
  [ it 's a trap !, 
  ] ( http://starwarshq.com/uploads/monthly_2015_07/admiral-ackbar-its-a-trap.jpg.9d3969f6562f31a3ead18f072a5498d3.jpg ), 
  what ?!, 
  i 'm moving there !, 
  germany !, 
  germany !, 
  she probably did n't understand them , after which they registered her name as not sure . 
  dutch here but insulted by proxy . 
  if they stayed there we would n't have to deal with the problem . 
  `` let us gooo , let us gooo , ca n't hold us back anymore ... '', 
  german nihilists are the worst . 
  `` give us ze money , lebowski ! '', 
  some hungarians i know are pretty salty about it . 
  of course , it 's nothing compared to how salty many still are about the soviet union and trianon . 
  not entirely . 
  hungarians typically hate turks because during the 150 year turkish occupation of hungary , the turks destroyed most hungarian medieval architecture like gothic churches and whatnot ( or transformed them into mosques ) . 
  edit : changed 300 to 150 . 
  china is a country . 
  islam is not a country .
