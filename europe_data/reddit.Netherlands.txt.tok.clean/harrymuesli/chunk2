  do n't worry about it , the spectrum 's gray on both sides . 
  there is no black and white divide here . 
  it 's 106 miles to brussels , we got a full tank of gas , half a pack of cigarettes , it 's dark and we 're wearing sunglasses . 
  hit it . 
  i agree . 
  but i 'm not saying that , am i ? 
  that whole `` any of the 1.5 billion muslims worldwide is part of ` my people ' '' thing which is often used to justify practically anything , annoys the fucking shit out of me . 
  this . 
  i like this . 
   liked to unionist terrorism i read that a lot the past few hours . 
  do you have articles or something that explain this ? 
  it 's a very grave thing and i 'd like to know more , 
  yeah i 've been to ireland a bunch of times and you guys never struck me as particularly irritable . 
  `` do you prefer czechoslovakia or protectorate of bohemia and moravia ? '', 
  is about as legitimate as a question . 
  get with it !, 
  `` inhabitants of the island called ireland '' then . 
  oh wow , cool !, 
  today i learned , 
   do n't say northern or regular . 
  sorry , was n't trying to offend anyone - so just call everyone ` irish ' ? 
  collecting [ flippo 's ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=flippos&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewil4cwlx7duahuculakhdmiay4q_auicigb&amp;biw=1097&amp;bih=512 ) , for sure . 
  they came in bags of chips . 
  the point is , the scots are arguing whether they want to call for another referendum . 
  whether or not it happens is irrelevant , as the london gvt actually calls the shots ; it 'll actively block any more referanda until the early 2020s , no matter how many scots would want it to happen again : https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence-blog/live/2017/mar/28/scottish-parliament-debate-independence-refeerendum-indyref2-sturgeon-mayor-urges-eu-citizens-to-press-for-brexit-deal-that-does-not-punish-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-58da66ade4b01ea2330bce0a, 
   it does n't though ? 
  but it does : https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence-blog/live/2017/mar/28/scottish-parliament-debate-independence-refeerendum-indyref2-sturgeon-mayor-urges-eu-citizens-to-press-for-brexit-deal-that-does-not-punish-uk-politics-live, 
   if scotland wanted to break away , which it does not it does , but parliament does n't let them hold a second referendum . 
  like in the good ole days , when all those pesky minions * also * had no say . 
  `` lol our 500 year old policy of conquest by colonization through exporting people , breeding a lot , and fucking up the local economy and power structure seeds discontent to this day :d :d roflmao 10/10 would do again 5/7 '', 
  well it is a solution . 
  i just do n't know if it 's a * final * solution . 
  if you ca n't recognize how your own comments in this thread have been quite patronizing to macedonians , danish , dutch and others , then pointing it out through reddit banter is n't gon na be of any help , i 'm afraid . 
  also , i think the totally legit republic of macedonia will be fine whenever it wants to enter the union . 
  i do n't think greece will be as adamant then as they are right now . 
   sidestepe no sidestepe on sidepepe, 
  ha , there you schooled me bro !, 
  or was it patronized ? 
  plus , you do your fair bit of patronizing other eu citizens ( and macedonians ) throughout this topic , so i do n't know what you 're talking about here . 
   i also expect some pressure on greece from the eu they 'll probably start painting hitler mustaches on pictures of european leaders again , as is tradition over there by now . 
  well , let me spell it out then . 
  you 're saying patronizing member states is the true spirit of the union . 
  as you 're patronizing macedonia itt , they should become a member state . 
  that way you can continue belittling your northern neighbor , as that 'd be the ` true spirit of the union . ', 
  indeed i too shudder at the thought, 
  true . 
  if germany were to reoccupy that part of europe they 'd both be your bitch !, 
   ahh patronising other member states . 
  the true spirit of the union right there . 
  so now you 're saying macedonia * can * join the union ? 
  i was paraphrasing , obviously . 
  you asked me where i read it , not if i can look up another source in a language convenient for you . 
   also the geographical region called macedonia is like , 10 % of the state . 
  the netherlands were a large part of what the romans called belgica , while parts of current-day belgium were named differently - acquitania , gallia , whatever . 
  you do n't see us dutch complaining about ` belgian appropriation of our heritage ' either , right ? 
   do n't forget their territory disputes too those russians were just on holiday . 
  upvoted for dankness, 
   and you just read that where ? 
  i just read that ancient ( city state ) greeks thought macedonians were backward half-idiots who were nomads , spoke in a laughable and unintelligible dialect , and were uncultured barbarians . 
  if that 's the case , why have they suddenly become so important ? 
  why appropriate * their * history as if it is the greek ( city states ' ) national identity too ? 
  you 're welcome , danskfriend !, 
  for anyone outside greece/macedonia it 's just amusing , but at the same time when it does get serious/geopolitical like blocking accession to eu and nato , it instantly seems incredibly petty . 
  it 's like some kid blocking chad from the playground because his parents named him chad . 
  go away ! '', 
  do you know why the uk was so against albania entering the eu ? 
  sounds weirdly specific somehow . 
  @ people saying scotland/north ireland/catalonia : so we 'd see breakaway nations become members first , and not one of the pending states like serbia , bosnia , montenegro , macedonia , georgia , albania , ukraine or moldova ? 
  that 's why they can not into nordic . 
  i 'm dutch so i 'm cheap and refuse to take a taxi . 
  that means crashing at someone 's place or biking home . 
  as for beers ( .25 l ) , they 're usually $ 2,50 to $ 3 each . 
  hard liquor $ 4 or $ 5 per shot . 
  wine about $ 4 per glass . 
  a game of billiards/pool/snooker sets you back about $ 10 an hour , a plate of [ party mix ] ( https://www.mora.nl/media/image/003270_partymix-xl-zijaanzicht.png ) type of food ~ $ 7 or so . 
  so , all in all , about 50 bucks i 'd say . 
  depending on how much you drink , and whether or not you want fancy stuff like cocktails for lady friends or whatnot . 
  long island iced tea 's usually ten bucks or so . 
   call it 40-50 euro if i walk home . 
  2 nights of that in a row + ryanair flight from amsterdam ( 30 $ ) + bus from dublin airport to the city center ( 5 $ ) + 2 nights in a hostel ( 40 $ ) = 175 for a grand ole time . 
  say 250 including some food and regular tourist expenses . 
  can confirm , am dutch but visited hungary half a dozen times . 
  both price ranges sound about right . 
  not uncommon in nl at all . 
  have worked regular saturday jobs from ~ 14 years of age onward , and had a paper route from ages 11 to 18 . 
  most people i knew back then did the same . 
  nothing much . 
  they 'll continue having lots of affairs , making and drinking wine , refusing to speak english while being perfectly able to do so , and being snobby while smoking cigarettes , all at the same time . 
  yes . 
  though it elevates your social status when you try to minimize or lose your accent . 
  so on the whole they 're diminishing . 
  you arrive , table with three people there . 
  first one checks your id , second one marks some sort of list , third one gives you a ballot . 
  then you go to the voting booth thingy and use a red pencil to mark one of the candidates or parties ( depending on which election sometimes you vote for a person , sometimes a party ) . 
  then you fold the ballot and put it in the box . 
  we can talk about english speakers behind their backs but not the other way around . 
  never ceases to amuse me ever so slightly . 
  dad jokes are the highest attainable level . 
  of course you can stay . 
  you guys are our homies .
