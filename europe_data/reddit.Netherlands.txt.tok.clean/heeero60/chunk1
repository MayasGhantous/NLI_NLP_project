i have the xkcd extension in chrome where all instances of the word car get changed to cat . 
  this thread is rather macabre to me , with the people accusing each other of loving to burn cats and cat parts everywhere . 
  the first two also exist in dutch ( `` verweggistan '' and `` de provincie '' ) , the first one also coming from donald duck magazine . 
  of course de provincie is only used in amsterdam , it is the place that `` boeren '' ( farmers ) come from . 
  the highway from arnhem ( netherlands ) to ruhrgebiet is made out of slabs and has no speed limit . 
  same goes for parts of the highway from dusseldorf to kassel and through the ruhrgebiet . 
  i poop on german concrete slabby highways . 
  dutch highways are way better quality . 
  they are too dense and busy to support the light speed limit though . 
  i like that they bumped it up to 130 though . 
  never heard of that . 
  i do mean eradicate . 
  my point is still valid though . 
  how can they find a safe and good way to carry on their business alone if it is illegal to buy their services ? 
  also , the aim of this set of laws seems to be to irradicate prostitution from the eu . 
  i think this is simply not possible , as there will always be women who want to use their body in this way as a source of income , and there will always be men to buy uit from them . 
  there is a great historical novel by ildefonse falcones , called [ the cathedral of the sea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cathedral_of_the_sea ) which gives a glimpse into the life of late medieval spain , where one also sees the workarounds christians and jews use for this rule . 
  it is really a great novel , i can recommend it to everyone . 
  spain definitely has loads of those . 
  ` los amantes pasajeros ' for instance , and also ` una pistola en cada mano ' , though both of those probably woud not rate an 8 . 
  uk is a whole different story , there are loads of romantic comedies set in the uk , ` four weddings and a funeral ' and ` notting hill ' probably being the best known ones . 
  it is not really my genre though , so could not tell you too much about that . 
  i did recently see ` austinland ' , which was hilarious . 
  apart from ` the pianist ' i do n't know any polish movies , so yeah . 
  it is set mostly in poland though . 
  like `` the pianist '' , `` simon '' and `` pan 's labyrinth '' you mean ? 
  edit : also , `` a clockwork orange '' and `` the celebration '' seem to fit this criterium . 
  my absolute favorite time in spain i had at [ benicassim festival ] ( http://www.fiberfib.com ) . 
  great bands ( the strokes were there at the time ) , hanging out at the beach all day before the music starts and goes through the whole evening and night . 
  awesomenes !, 
  it is a known law that driving skill decreases exponantially if you go south . 
  even in the south of france peopl drive worse than they do in the north . 
  but italy and greece are the absolute worse in europe . 
  hm , i am used to reddit users comparing others to nazi 's , but to compare your own country to nazi germany is definitely a new one for me . 
  they did cut of limburg though , so something went right . 
  maybe it 's a future map . 
  i was not so surprised that they did not know where the netherlands is , but more that they did know where luxembourg is . 
  there are like 3 people living there . 
  [ gabin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gabin ) is also things though ... 
  til : luxembourg is better known than the netherlands to americans . 
  and we had so many posts on the front page lately ... :-), 
  you should , it 's nice there . 
  thats the baltics . 
  i 'm pretty sure slovenia lies north of croatia , which is in the actual balkans . 
  thanks !, 
  indeed . 
  i am hoping for switzerland , cameroon and iran , but experince tells me spain , chile and usa is way more likely . 
  there are no very good teams in pot 3 and 4 though , so a real group of death is unlikely . 
  no plane for the away match means all players will be seasick when they arrive at the stadium . 
  thanks !, 
  we 're not used to being called not very insignificant . 
  well , we do have to house over 3 times the amount of people that live in norway , so we do need some space . 
  but indeed we are pretty small . 
  i can drive from my home in amsterdam to the german border within the hour , but also to the sea in 20 minutes . 
  if i had a car , that is . 
  the first bit is indeed a ferry , though it can only go in high tide , as the sea just leaves on low tide . 
  edit : nifty website , by the way . 
  [ norway is tiny compared to us !, 
  ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=fernandolaan&amp;daddr=rue+de+vis%c3%a9%2fvis%c3%a9straat%2fn653&amp;hl=nn&amp;ie=utf8&amp;sll=53.294362,5.363388&amp;sspn=0.326687,0.617294&amp;geocode=fbbslgmd6z9paa%3bfybzbgmd-izxaa&amp;oq=maastricht&amp;t=h&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrsp=0&amp;sz=11&amp;z=11 ), 
  probably the [ delta works ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delta_works ) in zeeland . 
  this really is what makes the dutch unique in their way of dealing with water . 
  plus , structures like the [ maeslantkering ] ( http://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/images/maeslantkering%20met%20panorama_tcm174-138127.jpg ) and the [ schelde flood barrier ] ( http://www.bus-idee.nl/neeltjejansstormvloedkeringkl.jpg ) are truely impressive . 
  it is the only place in poland i have been so far . 
  in fact , a lot of people i know have been there , while very few have been anywhere else in poland . 
  yeah , i think ours are the result of the last iceage . 
  if only we had regions with so little precipitation it would be an actual desert . 
  i am now look outside , not really looking forward to cycling home later ... 
  i think / u/sleepinginseamen is refering to the mountain we are [ apparently planning to build ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2032230/mountain-holland-engineers-brainstorm-ideas-jokey-request-journalist.html ) . 
  it is probably the most european non-european country though . 
  am here for four days celebrating my parents 40 year anniversary . 
  had an awesome time with the riga festival . 
  we saw a great air show today , and the most spectacular fireworks i have ever seen . 
  expect a post in / r/latvia about it . 
  man i was scared today . 
  riga festival was so threatening !, 
  especially all the kids playing violin and flute in the street , it was awful !, 
  so today it 's my first day in latvia . 
  thanks for the news flash ... 
  thank for the link . 
  it is something like what you said . 
  it is only municipal waste though . 
  also , they count anything that is not landfilled as recycled . 
  it is also noteworthy to look at [ this ] ( http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/municipal-waste-generated-per-capita/municipal-waste-generated-per-capita/figure%202.2-municipal-waste.eps.75dpi.gif/download ) figure of the total amount of waste produced per capita . 
  yes , stuff . 
  but what kind of stuff , and measured in what ? 
  electronics , plastics , paper , water , volume , mass , number of things , people that do recycling ? 
  so what exactly is this a percentage of ? 
  as it says in the article , europol is mainly an intelligence agency , it does not hold the power to make arrests . 
  i 'm confused . 
  am i missing something ? 
  we actually went on holiday to slovakia and austria last summer , it was great . 
  especially bojnice was a wonderful place . 
  friendly people , beautiful surroundings , we loved it . 
  and still italian tourists in amsterdam start speaking in italian to random locals and expect them to understand . 
  portal 1 and 2 are by far my favourite games ever . 
  when i was young i liked games like kings quest and command and conquer : red alert . 
  more recently i was into minecraft . 
  right now i 'm into factorio . 
  except they do n't have university that actually teaches science . 
  both amsterdam and rotterdam do , and also got the description .
