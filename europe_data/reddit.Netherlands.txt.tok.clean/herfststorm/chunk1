well . 
  no , not everything . 
  there are nice things , like the louvre . 
  but the overall feel of the city is just not my kind of thing . 
  ( or well , the touristy part . ), 
  edit : might also be because people speak so highly about it , it 's easy/easier to be disappointed . 
  and all the new buildings at the river , like the operahouse . 
  and \u00f8restad has some nice architecture too . 
  and the university buildings . 
  was there with uni * for * the architecture . 
  it 's just everywhere . 
  so awesome . 
  ca n't really explain it what 's missing in paris to like it . 
  why is it so bad to dislike paris though . 
  edit : and parisians do n't make it any easier . 
  i fell in love with it as well , such an awesome city . 
  also , danes really know how to do architecture right . 
  that 's good , though . 
  to each their own . 
  when we were in london , the business people in the centre would just sit down in the grass , enjoying their lunch and listen to the music . 
  i just do n't think things like that would happen in paris . 
   ( it was a special '' music week '' . 
  we didnt know about it - good surprise tho ) . 
  my opinion of paris changed after i visited . 
  everyone says it 's a beautiful and lovely and blah blah blah . 
  typical stuff . 
  i really do n't like it and i think it 's ^ ^ ^ ugly . 
  london though , one of my favs . 
  i 've met people from ukraine , they visited here . 
  that changed my way of viewing things in nl a lot , actually . 
  things that are normal here , are n't there , and obviously vice versa . 
  well . 
  what can we say . 
  they 're used to running and or walking long distances . 
  did russia show evidence in which they did n't shoot down the plane ? 
  if you can get people in space , you probably also have the possibilities to spy wherever . 
  but what do i know . 
  i 'm pretty sure some countries * can * show evidence . 
  but you know why they wo n't ? 
  because then they 'll give away their spying abilities . 
  but oh well . 
  putin 's photoshop did work for russians , apparently . 
   hateful western ukraine . 
  am laughing . 
  putin hates the west . 
  so yes . 
  we can assume that it 's his goal to not let ukraine join the nato/eu whatever is more west than russia will ever be . 
  let 's just say that without putin 's rebel no planes would 've been shot down at all . 
  difficult thing . 
  their goal was to kill anyway . 
  murder means you 're killing with premeditated thought . 
  ( i 'm not sure if this is the right term in english , in dutch it 's '' met voorbedachte rade . '' ), 
  except now it was a civil plane instead of a fighterjet . . 
  because people do n't understand that lowering standards of the first world does n't help the 2nd & 3rd world at all . 
  are you sure europe is the * only * place for people to live . 
  last time i counted there are ^ only ^ a ^ few more safe countries ... 
  i see , well , that does it explain it , haha . 
  but we decide where the waves go . 
  this . 
  i do n't know anyone who would want to switch with him . 
  we do have the northern lights . 
   ^ ^ ^ sometimes, 
  and you moved to nl ? 
  because that does sound familiar ... 
  netherlands : - 2nd ww - all the fucked up stuff that happened in the dutch indies - losing belgium ( jury is still out on that , i guess  ) - disaster year, 
  got it . 
  edit that comment so . . hopefully that helped , haha . 
  you do realize the '' throw bigger stones '' was n't that the police should actually throw canon balls across the border . 
  i do n't understand why they 're not using * their * ways to break up these stupid fights . 
  not necessary this one tiny fight . 
  things like this in general . 
  should n't be allowed . 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'll ^ ^ ^ add ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ nice ^ ^ ^ big ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ something ^ ^ ^ next ^ ^ ^ time ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ make ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ comment ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ bigger ^ ^ ^ stones ^ ^ ^ one, 
  where did i say that . 
  i also meant the size . 
  look on the worldmap . 
  it 's just not possible to get them all here . 
  we should help them * there * . 
  are there no teachers in those millions of people in that camp ? 
  i do n't really believe it ... eastern europe is happy enough they 're not under the ussr flag anymore . 
  they have to fix their own problems first with corruption , etc. 
  and the refugees do n't want even live in those places because no ` free money ' . 
  they could use them as cheap laborforce though . 
  for infrastructure or something . 
  i think it would stop if it 's clear that getting here on your own way does n't get you anything . 
  how cruel that may be . 
  if we 'd cut the benefits othey get when they managed to get here or so , would help as well . 
  money is n't free , that 's what they should learn/realize . 
  i think the same rules for working apply in nl . 
  tbh , nl is a tiny country . 
  hell , europe is a tiny continent . 
  it 's so full already . 
  :( that 's why i 'm more for the help them locally thing . 
  they know that place . 
  less stress ( for everyone involved . ), 
  edit : and if we 're going to with the '' pick them from camps '' - thing . 
  in my opinion , women & kids should go first . 
  when women lear a new language , they will teach others . 
  men will use it for power .
