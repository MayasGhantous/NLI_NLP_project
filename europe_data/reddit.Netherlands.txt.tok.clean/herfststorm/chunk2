  but we would be * sure they are n't economical immigrants . 
  when we take the refugees from the camps the whole pilgrimage to europe will stop . 
  traffikers/smugglers wo n't get money . 
  less people drown . 
  i 'd rather see the camps in those countries too though . 
  we ca n't get the whole world come to us just because we managed to have a good life here . 
  we should give them the ability to do the same in their own country . 
  ( for economical immigrants - that is . 
  and for refugees , obviously but eh that 's only * a bit * more complicated ), 
  why would that bring more problems ? 
  logistics wise ? 
  eh , there are zoos that give money to people that preserve nature . 
  so , no circus needed . 
  this . 
  they should understand that violence does n't get them anything but a trial . 
  if the eu will do the '' taking refugees from the camps '' , there should be a way to teach them how it works here . . 
  i always thought people from that area liked stones ? 
  should 've thrown back bigger stones . 
  ^ ^ ^ figure ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ speech . . edit : i said this because i do n't get how the police / border guards do n't ( maybe because they ca n't . ), 
  do anything against the violence . 
  the refugees also use violence because it is getting them things they should n't get it * that * way . 
  or , the second best option : chocolate on bread, 
  tbh , has there ever been no war at all in that part of the world ... 
  yes . 
  you 've the right to ask for ^ * it . 
  does n't mean the government * has * to * give * it to you . 
  ^ * ^ edit, 
  it was a one-way direction + the authorities were very strict . 
  i feel stupid . 
  ^ ^ but ^ ^ hmph . 
  ^ ^ weed ^ ^ is ^ ^ a ^ ^ herb . 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ not ^ ^ a ^ ^ spice !, 
  that makes sense to me . 
  but there were probably more millers who did n't make flour than ones who did . 
  so millers  millers + bakers . 
  so . . different surnames :p, 
  the miller and baker are very different though . 
  miller lived in/close by a windmill and milled grain/wheat to flour / saw wood / made paint/made paper . 
  thanks !, 
  of course !, 
  got ta remember our glorious empire . . right ? 
  is # 1 de jong or de groot ? 
  :p where did you get that list from ? 
  am wondering about the other names . 
  this exactly . 
  there is a huge shortage of student rooms in the netherlands ... and the waitlist for an house is a few years . 
  also the reason that a lot of people are angry that refugees get a house faster than dutchies who have paid for their waiting time . . 
  true about the bread . 
  scandinavians make delicious bread too . 
  but our cookies are the best . 
  the allowed max speed was 6 km/h . 
  aid workers are/were attacked for helping people . 
  ( too sick for words . . ) . 
  that 's why there are a few things that are different when someome attacks an aid-worker ( is that the right translation . . ? ) . 
  that 's why they changed a few things for those trials . 
  you mean the other way around ? 
   they had to get rid of their flour and whatnot . 
  hahaha yes . 
  thank god that is n't the case . 
  agree , in this case it is n't real violence . 
  but how they acted at the hungarian border tho ... maybe i should 've placed that comment on another post :p even though it 's a general thing that i noticed . 
  people are also named ` van de ( n/r ) heuvel ' here . 
  and heuvel = hill . 
  insulting = verbal . 
  physical = violence or agression . 
  i do n't know anything about austrian law either , but i ca n't imagine the law in austria would be that much different re : insults/violence towards the authority . 
  maybe it was 200 years ago , though . 
  i expected surname visserto be used more . 
  shouldve been arrested for violence against the police . 
  just because they can go against authorities they do n't have in their country , does n't mean they can do it here ... violence gets them everything and so it 's worth using it . 
  you 'd almost think they wasted their right for asylum . 
  ~ ~ ungrateful assholes ~ ~, 
  being in germany , such a nightmare , syria right now is a dream , obviously , ^ s, 
  german and danish . 
  german i can sort of understand mixing the two up when spoken . 
  but danish ? 
  nope, 
  let 's forget putin is backing up assad . 
  and he does want to destabilize europe . . 
  but wai ? 
  wie dutsj ka n't spiek without butsjering de language . 
  that 's sort of phonetically how we pronounce words . 
  so i ca n't really see the '' rad '' thing xd, 
  i can understand written german . 
  ca n't speak or write it ( anymore ) myself though . 
  can understand frisian , and because of that written norwegian/danish and swedish a little bit . 
  fluent in english - but i hate speaking it because of that godforsaken ugly dutch accent :(, 
  did n't know ukraine joined the eu . 
  yeah they sub the strong accents/dialects here too . 
  do you subtitle dutchies on belgian tv ? 
  because we subtitle flemish , sometimes . 
  good one !, 
  or the whales they hunt/kill on the faroer islands . 
  should work too . 
  i love how instead of blaming assad/russia/is + others ( ? ), 
  and whatever else is going on in the middle east , they blame hungary . 
  a country that 's protecting their own border . 
  that 's true and the engineering takes a few years too . 
  ( i should 've known that , except that i 'm construction engineerng and not infra/civil . ), 
  but it was just the first thing i thought of .
