  haha , you included the strikes already ? 
  you mean a few extra maasvlaktes ? 
  joking aside , big european wide infrastructure projects are probably the way to go . 
  enough countries who need their roads ( fixed/upgraded ) anyway . 
  best thing would be helping their country though . 
  difference in wages is only one thing . 
  the costs for living somewhere are just as important . 
  wages in western are europe higher , but everything is also more expensive . 
  true , i should 've mentioned it was also a bit of an ironic/sarcastic comment . 
  sssh . 
  do n't tell them we 've some good food too !, 
  and alcohol, 
  we should scare them away with our gross nw - european food . 
  refugees work now ? 
  the journey is difficult . . why would you not stop in first safe country ? 
  that 's the part i do n't get . 
  and i 'm sorry to say this - but the demanding and entitlement is really ridiculous . 
  as if everything is for free here , as if money grows on trees ? 
  '' we '' ( not my generation , but the older generations . . ) have worked very hard to get where we are today . . do n't really understand the rivalry thing either . 
  why would n't you be happy for someone that got something good ? 
  no matter what it is . 
  and no - i 'm not against helping refugees . 
  just think it should be done in a completely different way . 
  grass is always greener ... 
  because decisions on these issues should n't be influenced by emotional feelings . 
  the traveling circusus are definitely more cruel and i 'm very happy it 's banned now !, 
  i 'm just surprised that the dolfinarium is n't included . 
  shows with dolphins are okay - with sea lions are not . 
  i just do n't see the logic in that , that 's all . 
  good news !, 
   unfortunately het dolfinarium ( our very own sealife ) is n't included - because it 's not a traveling circus . 
  iirc it 's not for the guests but for the employees . 
  it 's not a binding referendum though ... 
  no idea , but my guess would be 1 % . 
  why would you care about the treaty itself if ( you think ) you can use it , to say you 're against the eu ? 
  today we saw why referenda about complicated things that people do n't care about are a stupid idea . 
  e : it 's too late for normal sentences . 
  that 's . . democracy at work or something . 
  exactly , which is why this referendum is so stupid . 
  the reasoning lots of people use is n't even about the eu-ukraine relationship , but between nl-eu at the expense of ukrainians . 
  still in doubt if i should vote ( i 'd vote yes , btw ), 
  denmark for sure as our twin . 
  it 's real !, 
  here 's some information ( dutch only though . . ) : [ ijsselkogge ] ( http://www.ijsselkogge.nl/ ) . 
  in no particular order i 'd say : denmark , germany and belgium ( mostly flanders ) . 
  because ? 
  russian composers are probably my favorite , they wrote the most beautiful choral music . 
  ( vespers is truly amazing ) also , honorary mention : alexander borodin . 
  well , that too , but i meant invading the island , 
  at last ...

  [ not a city , but still ; fort bourtange ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfmcqhutoau ), 
  [ the national galery ( london ) ] ( http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/ ) is also worth a visit . 
  i like rembrandt and vermeer - but i adore these paintings by monet : [ the water lilies ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=claude+monet+pond&amp;espv=2&amp;rlz=1c1avnc_ennl573nl573&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj1ge7uuf3jahvb0bokhahsboeq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=claude+monet+water+lilies ) and [ the japanese bridges ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=claude+monet+pond&amp;espv=2&amp;rlz=1c1avnc_ennl573nl573&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj1ge7uuf3jahvb0bokhahsboeq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=claude+monet+japanese+bridge ) .

  there 's not much racism in the usa ? 
  are you serious . 
  marriage is about love , person 1 loves person 2 . 
  i ca n't and do n't understand how people against marriage equality do n't ( want to ) get that . 
  there 's this thing where people can use a surrogate , donated sperm or adopt children . 
  of course they can have children , just like non fertile couples . 
  except it is n't biological . 
  more like , poland ca n't into 21st century, 
  i really hope you 're trolling and/or forgetting your ^ / s here , tbh . 
  why should n't they be able to marry to each other ? 
  does it hurt you when they do ? 
  it does n't make you unable to marry and it does n't '' degrade '' marriage in any way . 
  also , people in a ` everything other than hetero ' - relationship can have children anyway . 
  e. words, 
  you do realise gay people do n't choose to be gay either ? 
  just like straight people do n't choose to be straight , or to be able to have children . 
  not that you need to have children when you 're married and vice versa . 
  e : word, 
  you do n't know how many attacks the mi did prevent . 
  the microscope was invented here too . 
  lens makers and all that . 
  interesting timing, 
  army knife !, 
  1 ) norway / sweden . 
  i really love it there  3 ) denmark . . there 's only one problem . 
  ^ the ^ ^ language ^ ^ ^ obviously, 
  maybe that 's why they chose an army base . 
  two birds , one stone . 
  with that logic : better attack a government building ( where the people are who make the actual decisions to fight somewhere ) . 
  i guess i ca n't disagree with that  well , the tea is a coincidence , but i feel like i should try it  which kind of spices are in it ? 
  ^ did ^ they ^ add ^ glorious ^ empire ^ spices ? 
  are you sure you want to do that ? 
  war makes money and all that , 
  well , if you take the danes , we 'll take the swedes . 
  frietsaus and mayo are different . 
  i 'm not at all , but theology is very interesting . 
  why should religion get the special treatment ? 
  but that 's why it can never work out and should only be thought of as something that will only work in theory . 
  communism is * in theory * a good idea . 
  but then you get these things where everyone is equal , but some are more equal than others . 
  and there goes your communism down the drain . 
  the hunger winter happened because there were almost no food supplies .
