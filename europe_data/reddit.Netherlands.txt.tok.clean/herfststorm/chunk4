  people ate 600 calories a day and would go on journeys across the country for food . 
  never heard of people eating tulip bulbs ? 
  and there was almost no fuel . 
  and then you see these people complaining about eating bread twice a day . 
  that 's what we do here , get used to it . 
  but they would probably feel just as european as the russians in the rfa . 
  ( and i think that 's not a lot ) . 
  this indeed . 
  making the distinction of ( geo - ) political europe and cultural/historical europe is so important . 
  i mean , kievan rus , anyone ? 
  guess some people here also know some tulip bulb recipes . 
  i 've always learned that russia till the ural = europe . 
  and i 'd say that the very few who live in the russian far east are asian russians . 
  or so . 
  yeah , that 's it . 
  they 'll only give a medicine if your body ca n't handle an illness on it 's own . 
  which makes sense , especially with antibiotics . 
  or the expectation was too high . 
  i mean - depends from which side you look at it , right ?

  what about the riverfloods ? 
  huge parts of gelderland would drown without them . 
  the latin word for wolf is lupus , i 'd say that 's where loup/lupo derives from , 
  [ enjoy ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxijcfvds0e ) he was n't popular at all , but it 's ridiculous , so . 
  what is wrong with him being able to play a playstation ? 
  ooh , i see . 
  that makes sense . 
  i always thought it was meant to feel what it is like to miss your freedom . 
  you have everything you 'd have normally , except that you ca n't go outside whenever you want . 
  but your reason makes more sense , imo . 
  oi , do n't forget mongolia , they should pay europe !, 
  do n't forget norway and sweden . . 
  in amsterdam you 're also really close to other beautiful/interesting cities that are worth a visit : utrecht , delft , den haag . 
  amsterdam is n't the only city with canals , 
  you should try mixing mayo with curry . 
  so much better than ketchup . 
  oops , my mistake . 
  i did n't even see this thread was this old already . 
  blackface is the purpose of making fun of black people for being black or so ? 
  we do n't have the blackface history over here like it does exist in the usa ( and other places ?? ), 
  you understand that i 'm asking for a source ? 
  yeah , because a kid who wants to die ( and parents understand , etc etc. ), 
  having to find their own way is civilized ? 
  is that what you mean ? 
  edit : words, 
  the army is overthrowing the government . 
  those windturbines are structures though , not buildings . 
  i 'd say [ de maastoren ; 165m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maastoren ) is the tallest building . 
  edit : i mixed up two wikipedia pages , [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tallest_structures_in_the_netherlands ) says it 's 182m . 
  nl ca n't hold a binding referendum without changing the constitution . 
  i know . 
  i 'm just responding to the thing that being born here does n't automatically make you dutch like it would in america . 
  not that it 's the only way to become dutch . 
  nope . 
  you \u00b4 re dutch when one of your parents is dutch . 
  well , good thing we 've that covered too . 
  the meuse is a ` rain river ' . 
  jan van der heyden : the fire hose, 
  [ well , we 've the infrastructure already . . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defence_lines_of_the_netherlands#pre_1874_defence_lines ), 
  on every cycling-in-the-netherlands-video : '' you should wear helmets ! '', 
  we really , really should n't . 
  and finland !, 
  you could argue that she was a terminal patient too . 
  what 's the stance on euthanasia in the uk ? 
  seems like most of the politicians are against it , unfortunately . . 
  i do n't understand that either . 
  part of the fun is deciding what you want to see and where to go !, 
  interesting that you bring that up , because in our parliament the chairman ( woman in our case ) is a morrocan - dutch woman and she does n't take any bullshit from denk . 
  same with the mayor of rotterdam . 
  olaf koens said he sometimes pretends to be belgian , haha, 
  that 's interesting , in dutch you say `` i do n't speak chinese , do i ? '', 
  when the other person does n't understand you . 
  i 'm a nazi remnant , of course i 'm downvoting comments i disagree with . 
  ^ i ^ didnt ^ downvote ^ btw, 
  maybe berchtesgaden would be a fitting location ? 
  all the more reason not to include them . 
  thank fucking god for that . 
  or when people complain the pvv has too many votes : imagine if the cda and vvd did n't pretend to be pvv-light . 
  except that the pvv has been around way longer and actually was in the minority coalition after the 2010 elections . 
  he quit when the coalition had to make difficult decisions regarding the economy . 
  result : no one wants to govern with him . 
  that combined with his bs ideas makes him a less than favorably coalition partner . 
  edit : forgot a word, 
  edit : words , it 's late . 
  i think it 's one of the few parties who had '' discussieavonden '' here . 
  wow . 
  cda gained 6 seats ( !! ), 
  i remember when on schier the sgp had the most votes , herman de schermman went '' probably a bible belt family on vacation . '', 
  i do n't think the vvd is too keen on having a coalition with the pvv again . 
  i 'm not a fan of too many small parties in the parliament and ( binding ) referenda are a dealbreaker for me . 
  and because of those points i did n't check what other stuff they suggest , would 've been a waste of time . 
  apparently they do because the sp gets 14 seats . 
  was hoping the same , same for fvd . 
  the '' voting at the beach '' is at the uninhabited marker wadden . 
  the parties have to form a coalition to have the majority in the parliament . 
  the party with the most votes does n't mean it will end up in the government . 
  there 's a good explanation in [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zdblx/dutch_general_election_2017_megathread/ ) . 
  my bad . 
  i wanted to say ; * forming the coalition .
