  * even if he gets the most votes , it does n't have to mean anything . 
  do you know how the election proces works ? 
  surely you mean #bumor !, 
  it 's a damn shame you blame another country for your own fuck ups . 
   i do n't think defense spending needs to increase  but netherlands should play a greater role in the levant and middle east . 
  pick one . 
  yeah . 
  we can vote between 7.30 - 21.00 and the polling stations are at all different kind of places : town halls ( obviously ) , schools , train stations , shopping malls etc. 
  according to the government : a major reason is that the elementary schools , where many polling stations are established on that day are burdened the least . 
  iirc last time google had an election/results page as well . 
  i agree that there should be at least a treshold . 
  right now the threshold is 0.67 % , increasing that to 5 % is a big step though . 
  so i 'd go for 2 % - 3 % threshold instead . 
  ah yes . 
  just let turkey do whatever it wants abroad . 
  that 's a not a bad thing at all , right ? 
  this is what happened : 1 / turkish mfa minister urges dutch turks for a mass protest 2 / turkish consul misled the mayor of rotterdam on the arrival of the ( spare ) minister family matters 3 / minister is , beforehand , denied access to the netherlands 3 / convoy drives minister netherlands still inside , splits to avoid dutch police 4 / upon arrival of the minister at the turkish consulate refuses to cooperate 5 / fear of armed turkish security guards when expelling the minister 6 / minister resists and locks herself in a car 8 / forced deployment of a specialist police team 9 / expelling the minister and her entire entourage in dutch cars accompanied by the police helicopter . 
  i 'm not worried about who takes which side . 
  i meant that the turkish government is playing the victim at every opportunity . 
  ( i know why they do , though ), 
  either that or burning the french flag . 
  this indeed . 
  i 'm wondering if foreign media explained the whole story behind '' nl expells turkish minister '' . 
  and it all comes down to sovereignty . 
  turkey ignored it and some people have been giving nl too much shit for protecting it . 
  it 's so annoying to see they keep playing the victim card . 
  when you keep poking a beehive , do n't get angry if/when you get stung . 
  pointlessly complex ornaments ? 
  like the stars on usa 's flag ? 
  what an original joke !, 
  did you just think of it yourself ? 
  how can you even compare the two ?!, 
  there are only a few rhinos left , they 're going extinct . 
  i love them though !, 
  the behind-the-scenes of zoos is really interesting . 
  poor vince . 
  :( [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzg-chjh-8i ) is a baby vince . 
  and [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/lhfemh5rba0 ) he 's going on the transport to france . 
  ( dutch ), 
  poor vince .

  ( dutch ), 
  this is great , thank you for sharing !, 
  i once read that to make butter ( or just dairy farming in general ) the surroundings had to be extremely clean . 
   belgians are good with their hands this made me laugh way too loud . 
  nah , it 's tyskland in the scandinavian languages and duitsland in dutch . 
  do you really not get what hailzorp is trying to say ? 
  because they are n't staples like potatoes , cereals and rice, 
  because obviously euthanasia is a treatment suggested by doctors , instead of it to be required to be requested by the person in question . 
  it 's a humane way out , not an easy one . 
  and then we 've also moddergat ( mud hole ) and muggenbeet ( mosquito bite ), 
  maybe they are related , i 've no idea , haha . 
  they 've done the same thing with the netherlands : [ huis ten bosch ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/huis_ten_bosch_ ( japan ) ( dutch ) i find it a bit creepy , to be honest . 
  strange how they say the waddenzee is n't endangered . 
  [ because it is : drowning and gas drilling ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/16/gas-grab-and-global-warming-could-wipe-out-wadden-sea-heritage-site ), 
  wow , there 's still no bot for that stupid comment ? 
  i 'm sure it will . 
  there 's always the north sea we can steal from . 
  oh wow , did n't expect that . . you 're right , compared to the other percentages we 're really low . 
  if there 's no ` normal ' , then you also ca n't say 40 % growth in 50 years time is n't crazy or insane . 
  i agree , there are always ways to deal with population growth/densely populated cities . 
  part of the question is if that 's a way we want to live . 
  okay , and what is a normal population growth according to you ? 
  and there 's the fact that nl has a very high population density already . 
  what 's a normal population growth according to you ? 
  in nl it has been insane too 1963 :12 million 2017 :17 million the central agency for statistics expects 18 million in 2034 . 
  sadly , no one seems to care though . 
  how much km ^ 2 would we have to reclaim to keep the same population density ? 
  because what the hell . . 
  today i learned about [ the art of onfim ] ( http://www.goldschp.net/sig/onfim/onfim.html ) . 
  a 7-year old boy who drew on birch bark in the middle ages . 
  i do n't know why , but it makes me happy that nothing really changed about the way kids draw . 
  [ nytimes article with more info ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/world/europe/where-mud-is-archaeological-gold-russian-history-grew-on-trees.html ), 
  and they 're eastern europe to . 
  it becomes stupid when people mix up geographical europe and historical europe . 
  ( which is often the case on this sub and it 's annoying . ), 
  and because trees ended up as ships . 
  someone [ made a visualisation ] ( http://www.dwarshuis.com/various/airbnb/amsterdam/ ) where every dot is the first time an appartment is rented out , with the name of the owner . 
  sad times . 
  welcome to nl , where people complain about too many animals burniing to death , yet refuse to pay more for the locally farmed , more eco/animal-friendly meat . 
  it 's called biologie when we 're talking about the flowers , bees and trees . 
  science of natural law would be natuurkunde ( physics ) . 
  wiskunde = the art of of knowing / being certain meetkunde ( meten - measuring ) = so the art of measuring scheikunde ( from scheiden ) = the art of seperating, 
  architecture is n't bouwkunde though . 
  architecture = architectuur and built environment = bouwkunde . 
  architecture is just a part of built environment . 
  * dutch indies , not indonesia . 
  it 's really stupid how there 's barely any focus on the asian theater in dutch high schools . 
  had to learn most from family , if they wanted to even talk about it . . 
  because that 's bs what he 's saying . 
  sinterklaas is centuries older than that . 
  of course it 's a map for nl . 
  if you are interested in cartography/topography , check [ this site ] ( http://www.topotijdreis.nl/ ) . 
  they uploaded maps from the year 1815 - 2016 , and to get a more detailed map of a specific area you just have to zoom in . 
  guessed all the cultural/historic questions , so not too bad i think !, 
  i find dutch police cars way easier to recognize than of other countries . 
  you 'd almost think it depends on what you 're used to . 
  great work , op !, 
  you should n't only compare them with the richter scale , but with ground acceleration as well .
