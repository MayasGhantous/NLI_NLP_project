   the calendar has been printed in dutch , arabic , spanish , english and russian to maximise its impact , and a $ 800,000 reward is being made available for those whose information ends in a successful conviction . 
  i thought you were joking . . but that makes me sad to hear that 's what the media say . 
  a ) amsterdam has worldclass museums ( van gogh , rijksmuseum , anne frank huis - to name a few ) . 
  b ) weed and rld is n't only in amsterdam . 
  re : your edit ; no worries - i misread that too . 
  why would you go to amsterdam for that , ee is much closer for you . 
  straight out of [ fanfare ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8ia00cj8ne ) ( by bert haanstra ) !, 
  mashed potato is obviously the better choice for dinner ( and actually prefer it for that too compared to snacks ) . 
  but taste wise ? 
  no way , 
  it 's not the best ( that 's the indonesian food ) , but it 's not the worst either . 
  imho the worst is either fish/seafood or the mashed potato dishes . 
  the 2 % was just a random number as an example . 
  i agree with you , all these small parties is really stupid . 
  i do n't know how it would work out if the minimum requirement to govern would be 2 % , but they could still be opposition if the party does n't get that amount of votes . 
  wat de boer niet kent ... ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ stick-in-the-mud ... 
  i 'm quite certain the holodomor happened before the holocaust . 
   did you think british , american , or even french forces would have been punked out by serbian thugs ? 
  you decide , considering they refused to give air support . 
  the local community gets drunk tourists vomiting in the hallway . 
  yay ? 
  ca n't blame them they do n't know every detail , considering it was kind of a huge war and they do n't know all the languages either so they need help with that too . 
  also , if you know something about ` x ' of the war , you 're welcome to send them a message . 
  and whatever his surname is , he still did what he did . 
  i mean . . there is a reason we call a bike '' ijzeren/stalen ros '' ( iron/steel horse ) . 
  stupid leaders and and the first modern war . 
  did the great war ever tell how they got to be leaders in the first place ? 
  i ca n't really remember . 
  ah , genocide and the man who sent people up a mountain mid-winter in -20 c weather ; [ the great war - ottoman disaster ] ( https://youtu.be/ew39inpunoy?t=3m43s ), 
  the university of franeker got closed in 1811 , thanks napoleon . 
  the university of groningen should have been added , it was founded in 1614 . 
  the european eel is a critically endangered species . 
  since the 1970s , the numbers of eels reaching europe is thought to have declined by around 90 % ( possibly even 98 % ) . 
  contributing factors include overfishing , parasites such as anguillicola crassus , barriers to migration such as hydroelectric dams , and natural changes in the north atlantic oscillation , gulf stream , and north atlantic drift . 
  recent work suggests polychlorinated biphenyl pollution may be a factor in the decline . 
  in dutch it 's called europese nerts . 
  you do n't have to be nationalistic to prefer stuff from your own country - supporting shorter transport is a good thing !, 
  that 's what ive read before , that the tomatoes are too watery . 
  i prefer [ these ones ] ( https://versenhandig.nl/image/cache/data/fruit_groenten/snoeptomaten_groenten-1000x667.jpg ) . 
  this . 
  i 'm also curious about per km2 . 
  why not ? 
  people also post pictures of just different mountains . 
  wtf . 
  probably almere , but expected that would be more 35 + . . 
  obviously , the area is 6 metre below sea level . 
  for me it 's the other way around , i think living in a valley would make me feel claustrophobic . 
  [ of course it is !,

  you can only see the ijsselmeer ( the lake side ) . 
  however , there 's at least one spot where you can easily stop and stand on top of it . 
  it 's so boring ... i was so happy i had tailwind when i cycled from north holland to friesland . 
  erdogan is wearing an eyepatch . 
  i see , thank you for the explanation !, 
  i should read more about ww2 . . 
  i thought he invaded norway to get acces to their heavy water plant . 
  no frisian cities other than leeuwarden . . harlingen , franeker and dokkum are beautiful , maybe even more so than leeuwarden . 
  damn it , finland . 
  i do the same , i like to know where i 'm going and it 's just as much part of a vacation as actually being there is . 
  nope . 
  wow , who would 've thought the little mermaid is tiny . 
  the building is actually [ 2 centuries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/binnenhof ) older !, 
  i mean , what does holland mean in this case . 
  the holland region ( which south holland is a part of ) or the rest of the netherlands ? 
  i 'm wondering what they mean to say with it . 
  as for frisians , they have been around longer than dutch people , so it surprised me they did n't get any samples . . 
  they probably would 've been close to danes and norwegians . 
  holland and south holland , obviously that makes a lot of sense ... and frisian is n't mentioned at all . . ? 
  excuse you , it 's obviously dutch clay , it 's all in the name !, 
  depends on at which faculty you study , i guess . 
  do n't you have a class after the exam + grading where the lecturer tells how the exam went etc ? 
  that 's what we had , and if you doubt you should just ask them about it asap . 
  that 's what i experienced too at a uni of applied sciences . 
  the minor was in english and 1 or 2 of the lecturers spoke stonecoal english , those classes were terrible . 
  so basicly how it is now . 
  industries where english is used , use english . 
  everything else dutch , problem solved . 
  too bad there are n't any lecturers that speak sort of decent english . 
  beautiful !, 
  going to visit luxembourg in a few weeks , ca n't wait !, 
  there was a truck attack in the center of stockholm this year . 
  weird , how only the dolmens in wales are mentioned . 
  drenthe has a lot of those too . . 
  poor belgium ... , i say as a dutchie . 
  and stole our flag !, 
  yeah , iirc they also built the them using old techniques , like the rigging etc. 
  there 's also a skelet of another ship at bataviawerf , but it went bankrupt . 
  no worries , haha . 
  they 're well worth a visit , but it 's also a bit of ` when you 've seen one , you 've seen them all . ', 
  no [ batavia ] ( http://www.1dagzeilen.nl/images/slideshow/171_qj9p.jpg ) at the bataviawerf ? 
  or the [ amsterdam at the maritime museum ] ( http://www.tinker.nl/media/imagick/2149_1200_800_crop.jpg ) ? 
  i know they 're not originals . . but they 're pretty good copies . 
  oh , okay , we do n't have that here . 
  what 's may 1 ? 
  then you would know that having a king does n't mean there is no democracy ? 
  nl is a parliamentary representative democary . . and the king is ceremonial, 
  if only you would just read a wikipedia page for once . 
  because symbols mean influence ?
