  we do n't elect a pm , because of the coalition system . 
  but otherwise we have a similar system, 
  he is n't saying anything about being a better or worse person . 
  i do n't think you quite understand that the persons above me are replying to someone with a us flair ? 
  of course i know what a constitutional monarchy is , i live in one ... ? 
  that 's not even what he 's saying ? 
  they vote for their head of state , which is how they ended up with the current situation . . 
  i agree , it 's nice for longterm relationships between countries too . 
  which is how they ended up with the current situation ? 
  edit ; i thought they were talking about the us because of the flairs . 
  apparently not . 
  seems like all republicans are triggered just by seeing a picture of a king ? 
  you think ? 
  maybe money-wise , but i doubt anyone wants to be in his shoes . 
  you 're saying that a country should n't be a welfare state , but at the same time people should live in freedom and be able to live their lifes . 
  how do you not see that those are the exact opposite . 
  you 're basicly saying only rich people should be able to live their lifes and poor people do n't matter . 
   and country shouldnt be a welfare state  it should give people more freedom and let people live their lives . 
  what ? 
  do you realize those are opposites ? 
  and sint maarten, 
  whoa , the silkroute . 
  we 've a specific word for that in dutch too , ` graat ' . 
  in my time ; primary school around 300 ( 20-25 per class ) high school 1200 total ( 25-30 per class ) , only havo/vwo . 
  and it 's on of the many locations of the ` scholengemeenschap ' uni of applied sciences ; 25k students, 
  i 'd say robbert dijkgraaf is doing well too , freek vonk is also succesful ( not counting his tvshows ) . 
  i know , i prefer rotterdam too , but the fact is that groningen --  rotterdam/amsterdam is closer than rotterdam/amsterdam --  groningen . 
  i can see the international thing . 
  however the wiet tolerantie , architecture and gezelligheid is how i 'd describe 95 % of the cities , so in that case amsterdam really is n't that special . 
  amsterdam the best , sounds like randstad arrogantie  . 
  i honestly do n't get what 's so great about amsterdam , apart from the world-class museums , which are the only reason i visit every now and then . 
  the randstad . 
  happens often enough that people respond in their native language . 
  just saying he does n't always sugarcoat stuff . 
  and there 's also the tv-series '' hij is een zij '' ( he is a she ) , where they follow transgenders , when they 're in transition . 
  since when does nl border canada ? 
  the only occasion i can think of is shows/games with [ harnassed frisian horses . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0guid0i-hi&amp;t=14s ) . 
  i think it 's required for whatever reason . 
  i 've never heard of pickled walnuts before , are they any good ? 
  i 'm sorry to say but maybe you should put some effort in first , before asking a question like this . 
  if you take the effort of a whole 2 seconds you find [ these kind of sites ] ( http://www.mastersportal.eu/ ) . 
  i used this site to see which universities offer the study i want to do . 
  then you can check what the requirements and tuitions etc. 
  are per university . 
  good luck . 
  i 'm from the north of nl , but i imagine someone from southern nl ( brabant & limburg ) would say something different . 
  same here . 
  i get why we are lumped together with belgium - but i feel a lot more culturally closer to northern germany and denmark . 
  the only ` summer camp ' i know about are the sailing camps / sailing schools . 
  the ships itself are at least 100 years old !, 
  when the farmers did n't have any cargo , they could sometimes win a cash prize of the organized competitions . 
  there 's a fixed number of ships : 14 and belong to a town , in a way it 's a bit like sports clubs . 
  fierljeppen originated from farmers who had to use poles to leap over small water drainage channels to access different plots of land . 
  nice !, 
  very complete , but since friesland is the ( edit : one of the ) odd ones out in nl , here 's a small addition : - - ga last name endings are also really common - landscapes : there 's the [ ` wouden ' ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationaal_landschap_noardlike_fryske_w%c3%a2lden ) in the eastern part , lakes and canals in the south western part . 
  and let 's not forget the [ waddeneilanden ] ( http://www.tenthuisopvlie.nl/wp-content/uploads/luchtfoto.jpg ) - which brings me to the summer sports : sailing / skutsjesilen ( sailing with 100 + year old barges ) and fierljeppen ( far leaping ) . 
  kaatsen ( 16th century handball ) is still played in south-west frisia . 
  - and i ca n't leave out the delicious [ oranjekoek ] ( http://payload48.cargocollective.com/1/6/203897/3278412/oranjekoek%20de%20groot%20web_1200.jpg ) or [ s\u00fbkerb\u00f4le ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=fries+suikerbrood&amp;rlz=1c1avnc_ennl573nl573&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewijrdpg59vuahvgkfakhe9vbx8q_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974 ), 
  the north eats patat and the heretics call it friet ( en ) . 
  i think it 's [ the landscape paintings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacob_van_ruisdael ) [ by ruysdael ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacob_van_ruisdael#/media/file:the_windmill_at_wijk_bij_duurstede_1670_ruisdael.jpg ) and [ the bull by paulus potter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paulus_potter#/media/file:paulus_potter_-_de_stier.jpg ) . 
  landscape paintings were n't a big thing until then , but they made it a new genre and painted them as an ode to the work that went into making the land ( aka the polders ) . 
  that 's the best ingredient of snert . 
  there are plenty of lakes , but eh , they do n't really count as a beach imho . 
  the wadden islands are the closest . . 
  especially combined with red cabbage . 
  did you do any research yourself . . ? 
  check the tourism sites ( for example , [ the dutch one ] ( http://www.holland.com/be_nl/toerisme.htm ) ) . 
  booking.com is nice to find places to stay ( from budget to 5 * ) . 
  tripadvisor for if you want reviews . 
  ( split pea soup . ), 
  this . 
  and when you do get compliments they actually mean something . 
  the indigenous cultures , they 're fascinating , but i find southern africa and latin america also really interesting . 
  i can understand english , dutch and spoken frisian ( reading is meh ) . 
  can get the gist of german , and i can get the gist of written danish/norwegian/swedish . 
  ca n't really remember we 've been taught about the japanese occupation of the dutch indies . 
  hell , it 's probably becoming less of a taboo to talk about it now . 
  what i know about is via documentaries/tv shows . 
  we do !, 
  also used to make oliebollen for new years eve . 
  this , they 're more cultuurlandschappen , but still beautiful . 
  examples : [ 1 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/be/e6/03/bee60374c65231ef3cd47677d5f39829.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.strandexpress-ameland.nl/images/oerd.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.holland.com/upload_mm/9/8/c/52743_fullimage_1_nederland%20waterland_nationaal%20park%20de%20biesbosch_resized_560x350.jpg ) . 
  it 's also convenient it stays concentrated in one spot . . 
  i agree with you that there 's a lot wrong in iran , but it 's also a country that 's worth a visit . 
  okay , what 's your point ? 
  there 's a reason the lanes are red ... 
  i did get red for florida , but houston instead of louisiana . 
  [ i got this ] ( https://nyti.ms/2rpqzdn ) . 
  newark , yonkers & jersey city . 
  too much focus on europe / 17th century . 
  not enough about how shitty nl was in the 19th century . 
  i would 've liked if more oriental / middle eastern history was included . . 
  why obviously ? 
  my grandparents visited the country and it was one of their favorite vacations . 
  did n't feel unsafe either ( they were part of a group though ) . 
  i 'd say fixing the problems in groningen is the biggest project . . 
  those silly southerners bring the average down , apparently people from groningen and frisia are the tallest in nl . 
  i 'm 1,75 m - average for women , i think . 
  however , i feel short because most women i are either just as tall , or taller . 
  edit : living in the north , no idea if that matters , tho .
