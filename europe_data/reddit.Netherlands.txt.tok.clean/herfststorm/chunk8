  never seen the waddenzee video before , thanks for sharing !, 
  regarding the afsluitdijk and the ecological disaster , they 're planning to build a [ fish migration river ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdo6dx7hksc ), 
  between 20-25 . 
  i read your comic when you posted it on polandball , you 've an awesome drawing style !, 
  and the little things like the framed pictures are so funny too . 
  will you make more grandpa < x  stories ? 
  adding [ nederland waterland ] ( https://www.vpro.nl/speel~rbx_vpro_1571673~nederland-waterland~.html ) to that list . 
  you should !, 
  i do n't like mustard , so i expected to dislike mustard soup too - but the opposite is true !, 
  these ones , in no particular order : pumpkin soup mustard soup tomato soup asperagus soup iranian soup with legumes and pulled meat is probably the best i ever had though . 
  they also make a really delicious lentil soup . 
  [ social liberalism ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=70.1&amp;d=60.1&amp;g=66.2&amp;s=73.9 ), 
  never seen one, 
  yeah , we say spaniard now too . 
  it was just a ( failed ) 80 years war joke . 
  would you prefer to be called * spanjool * ? 
  e : changed the demonym, 
  yup , it was named van diemensland before it was called tasmania . 
  our zeeland , abel tasman discovered it . 
  easy , the year where the french , english and the bishop of m\u00fcnster attacked at the same time : [ the disaster year , 1672 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rampjaar ) . 
  no , born early '90s, 
  living in frisia , and it certainly beats the randstad . 
  it 's relaxed , quiet and i 'm at two of the wadden islands ( my favourite place in nl ) in 2 hours . 
  living in overrijssel/gelderland sounds nice too though , especially the places along the ijssel/hanze cities . 
  i do n't know what the accents in gelderland sound like . . but plat amsterdams , haags & utrechts are the ugliest , imho . 
  i see , in that case the hills * are * ancient , since the first ones were built 500 bc . 
  when is something ancient ? 
  fav in nl : rotterdam , i ca n't even explain why . 
  as for the world . . 
  i really like the generic irish and scottish , but southern english / rp can sound so calm and soothing . 
  we had a '' last school day '' / examenstunt , but that 's before the exams start . . 
  it 's funny , because i feel like we 're much more like denmark than belgium . 
  it 's probably because i 'm from above the rivers . . 
  nice list !, 
  if anyone is interested , [ here ] ( https://www.friesmuseum.nl/en/collection/icons/traditional-frisian-costume/ ) is a bit more information about the frisian costumes . 
  yes !, 
  my parents do n't like hot weather - so we mostly went to germany , austria and scandinavia . 
  and they preferred the small , simple campings , ca n't really remember playing with other kids . . 
  the wadden islands - amazing beaches and just such an amazing atmosphere , can not recommend them enough . 
  reminds me of [ eddie izzard 's sketch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hjqsvoy6vu ) . 
  '' because there 's a fucking * h * in it . '', 
  and the result is shitty puns , [ 1 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a1/8d/ce/a18dce58e73c3b515bc9376e6cff7f5c.jpg ) and [ 2 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/c9/ba/cc/c9bacc21224452b1a72017361231ed90.jpg ) . 
  sigh . 
  wow , the vakwerk/timber framing is beautiful , never seen it on farms in nl . 
  also interesting dakpannen are used more , and of course the squared / innercourt buildings , not used in the north !,

  it 's probably a lot different down south . 
  a lot of rainforest gets cut for oil palm plantations . 
  you should try to avoid using stuff with palm oil as much as possible , even though that 's difficult because it 's in so many things . 
  we had 1 year of religion / spiritual thing , only 1h a week , public primary school . 
  it could 've been very interesting ( more about the history side of things ) but it was too ... mushy . 
  i think religious schools do the whole prayer thing ( ? 
  ) , but everything probably differs per school . 
  the year after we had 1h/week of humanism , which was definitely better than the religious lesson . 
  in some high schools you can choose to follow philosophy , have n't heard about ethics classes . 
  nop , i dont have a recipe, 
  okay , okay , you win  do n't use mustard though - use [ curry ketchup ] ( http://www.hollandforyou.com/images/stories/virtuemart/product/hela-curry-ketchup.jpg ) . 
  no no , i 'm sorry . 
  i did n't see your link . . you 're right , there is no difference . 
  ( except maybe the rookworst ), 
  =( i was so happy you wanted to try traditional dutch food . 
  this is way too vague , did you do any research of the areas you 're going to visit anyway ? 
  there 's plenty of information to find about '' must sees '' ... and did you check / r/travel ? 
  in french : \u00c9tape boulevard b\u00e2bord , cabillaud en cahute dr\u00f4le mannequin drogue brandevin gribouiller too many to name here : [ in japanese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glossary_of_japanese_words_of_dutch_origin ) maelstrom and a lot of naval terms made it into other languages, 
  polders might be boring for us , but if you 're living anywhere else it must be weird to see the flatness . 
  agree , but when you 're in copenhagen , you might as well go see it + the vesting is close by iirc . 
  amsterdam is beautiful , but the architecture is shared by a lot of dutch cities . 
  i definitely do recommend to visit the museums !, 
  i loved all of the ones i visited . 
  amsterdam , the only thing that 's unique for the city are the museums . 
  everything else ( canals , weed , rld < overrated as well , but ok ) is found in 99 % of the other cities too . . 
  my maternal grandfater lived in the dutch indies during the japanese occupation as a 10 year old boy . 
  after the war they were interned by the japanese to protect them from the indonesian independence army . 
  they managed to go to nl relatively quickly after ww2 ended , thank god . 
  he does n't like to speak about it at all . 
  and for me it 's difficult to comprehend that your oppressor became your protector . 
  my maternal ( great ) grandmother hid people in their house . 
  my grandmother does n't mind talking about it and showed where they hid people/great-grandfather ( for when he had to hide because of the razzias ) . 
  my paternal grandparents lived in limburg , but they fled to the north when it became the frontline . 
  iirc they were in a train that was bombed/shot at ( ? ) . 
  they survived it though . 
  i do n't know if they talked about it , because they died when i was only 8 years old or so . 
  my dad does n't mind talking about it though . 
  so no fighting , but surviving . 
  jeans , shirt , sneakers . 
  people suddenly stopping , and especially crowded places or end of the escalator . 
  lately excited , planning a long vacation  5 . 
  do n't have an answer , really . 
  shittiest sleep rhythm . 
  sleep late , wake up late . 
  we say , '' am i speaking chinese ? '', 
  but that 's when someone else does n't understand you . . 
  het spaans benauwd krijgen : getting the spanish anxiety ( transl ? 
  ) : meaning : being very afraid/worried/anxious . 
  meaning : `` working fast but delivering a product of low quality . '', 
  apparently the term was used in the seventeenth and eighteenth century in horsemanship . 
  i know people already said there are too many travel/tourism topics and it 's really annoying to see people not do some research themselves . 
  however , people being people , maybe there should just be a monthy/biweekly sticky to streamline it ? 
  or force people to assign a flair to their topic ?
