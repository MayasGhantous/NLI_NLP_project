  ah , the randstad syndrome . 
  i never get that brand , and considering they 're with caramel i probably wo n't like them either . 
  ( did n't see your question in your earlier comment  ), 
  oh , right . 
  i did n't check the brand , i just thought they made stroopwafels too but with caramel or sometimes even honey . 
  guess that 's not true . 
  edit : does n't starbucks have stroopwafels ( with caramel ... ) ? 
  apparently there are stroopwafels in the usa , but with [ caramel ] ( https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/43voffjmh5le3wcxyx5b/im-4200x2544/v1/c700x420.jpg ) instead of syrup . 
  why !, 
  the $ 34k is bruto too , but i 'm not sure how it works with healthcare . 
  afaik that 's seperate from income here . 
  it is considered high for dutch standards though , modal salary would be ~ 34k here .

  [ like this ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=indonesische+rijsttafel&amp;rlz=1c1avnc_ennl573nl573&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjg6upk_zdtahxoc8akhcvxdpcq_auibigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974 ), 
  persian food . 
  it 's delicious . 
  a few months ago i went to a persian restaurant and it was the first time i ever ate something middle-eastern . 
  do recommend . 
  and of course rijsttafel , which is always good . 
  to be honest , i only know about him because there was an exhibition of his work a few months ago and it got a lot of visitors . 
  [ the bull by paulus potter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_young_bull#/media/file:paulus_potter_-_de_stier.jpg ) or [ ruysdael 's landscapes ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=ruysdael+landscapes&amp;rlz=1c1avnc_ennl573nl573&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjw3fsilpdtahukisakhwc6bt0q_auibigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974#imgrc=g5o-hiaprs1crm: ) are iconic because they were one of the firsts painting the landscape .

  but one of my favorite paintings is [ old woman and boy with candles by peter paul rubens ] ( https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/the-collection/artworks/old-woman-and-boy-with-candles-1150/ ) ( i 've too many favourites though ) . 
  you have lawrence alma - tadema and he 's quite famous , but i would n't know what his most known painting is . 
  the girl with the pearl earring by rembrandt ? 
  european : eesti and iceland non-european : botswana and nepal , because it 's not a rectangle . 
  flemish is very different from dutch , have you heard them speak ?!, 
  these elections the pvda ( labour party ) lost 75 % of their seats . 
  i obviously do n't know how much only dutch speakers understand of ( for example ) danish , but i feel like having 2 native languages helps a lot . 
  i never learned to speak frisian though , only reading and listening . 
  dialects are something different yeah , but i thought we were talking about standardized dutch here . 
  you can know how it 's pronounced by the way it 's written for most words , but there probably are exceptions . 
  the pronunciation . 
  you just have to guess if you did n't hear it before . 
  wtf is that ? 
  dutch is so straightforward compared to that mess . 
  i ca n't really say that knowing frisian made english that much easier . 
  i do think it makes it easier to understand scandinavian languages . 
  i guess i feel a connection in the way that i find it amazing people managed to live in a swampy , humid and cold area that endured a lot of floods . 
  and i sometimes wonder what our politics ( in general , not necessarily the government etc ) would be like if it was n't for the fact people had to find consensus to be able to manage the water . 
  yup , schier & vlieland are my favourite islands , but the other islands have good beaches too . 
  probably not , but since it was n't mentioned by anyone ... 
  adding to this : hiding easter eggs for kids to find . 
  and we 've the whole '' going to the furniture mall ( woonboulevard ) '' on easter monday . 
  and big countries can never be real friends . 
  i could n't find a lot of history about my town , except that the church was built in either the 11th or 12th century and it had a monastery . 
  here 's a bit of general information about the habitation of friesland . 
  the province of friesland is bordered in the north by the wadden sea . 
  in ancient and medieval times , habitation in friesland occurred only in those areas which were elevated above sea level or on artificially built mounds known as terp , weird or ward . 
  these mounds were areas of refuge in times of flooding . 
  the artificial mounds became redundant after the building of the dikes on the border of the wadden sea . 
  archeologicla finds show there was already habitation of this area in the stone age ,, 
  true , but did n't erik van muiswinkel start it ? 
  finland : rankings . 
  so searching would probably work too . 
  it was really weird , i was on vacation in northern norway when it happened . 
  we were not really following any news ( camping ! ), 
  and my brother texted us in the evening . 
  could n't believe it , but then we saw the newspapers . 
  it felt awkward to be there ; as if you 're an intruder to something very private . 
  in the '70s there have been a few hostages : 1 . 
  in 1975 a train was kept hostage for 12 days : [ train hostage crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_dutch_train_hostage_crisis ) 2 . 
  in 1977 two hostages happened at the same time : [ again a train hostage crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_dutch_train_hostage_crisis ) and [ a primary school hostage ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/gijzeling_lagere_school_in_bovensmilde ) . 
  both hostages lasted for twenty days . 
  i 'm not really sure * why * , but i think it had something to do with wanting an independent moluccan country from indonesia . 
  oh god ... we do : [ lief klein konijntje ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwdhzl_o6qy ) ( cute little bunny . . ) and [ het vliegerlied !,

  luxembourgs , for obvious reasons . 
  and the colours of the estonian one just fit together so well . 
  one has a fake language and the other is a fake country . 
  they were negotiating to have the campaign/speech at a smaller place , but turkey did n't want to get to a solution . 
  during those negotiations turkey started threatening with sanctions . 
  that 's the moment nl banned them . 
  edit : to be honest , i have n't paid too much attention to the polls . 
  i honestly expected wilders to get less votes because other parties hardened their stance . 
  why is it antidemocratic and why would wilders get more votes with this ? 
  i would say the post about [ kaas ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/3qe8f3/kaas/ ) ( cheese ) and the [ follow up ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/3zpx63/kaas_van_brokjes_naar_plakjes/ ) for our country sub . 
  they 're about the problems when slicing cheese . 
  that 's true . 
  guess this is what happens when you ignore what the receiving state says . 
  there are quite a few articles explaining the diplomatic side of this incident . 
  for people who do n't know why she was expelled : [ here 's the official statement ] ( https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2017/03/12/government-statement-concerning-turkish-minister-kaya%e2%80%99s-escorted-departure ), 
  nah , he 's only on the coins . 
  the guilder banknotes didnt have beatrix either, 
  landmarks : afsluitdijk or the oosterscheldekering or maybe a map , [ something like this ] ( http://www.let.rug.nl/~maps/images/blaeu/deventer.jpg ) persons : willem blaeu , eise eisinga , erasmus , van gogh . 
  or maybe one of the 16/17th century painters and scientists . 
  thank you for that ( long ! ), 
  list . 
  i 'm going to try to find them here in nl !, 
  what are , in your opinion , good movies about life in the ddr ? 
  the ferry to oslo is relatively cheap and short compared to the westcoast . 
  so when you 're there anyway , you might as well spend a day or two as well .
