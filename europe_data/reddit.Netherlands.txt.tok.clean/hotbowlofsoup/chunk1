yeah ... because if a european does something great without comparing it to something american , did he really do something all that great ? 
  who cares whether this is european or american . 
  how is that relevant ? 
  this is something we should be proud of as the entire human race . 
  if your goal is to feel better about russia you mean ? 
  sure . 
  there are russian laws that forbid gay `` propaganda '' . 
  but a pro lgbt rights song like this getting the third most votes from russian viewers at the contest , and this song being the most downloaded eurovision song on itunes , that ca n't be censored . 
  it shows there are more people who are pro lgbt rights than the russian media would like everyone to believe . 
  and you could argue people just liked the song , but at least they did n't think it was morally wrong to vote for it or download it . 
  i can imagine if you 're gay in russia , seeing plenty of russians embracing this song , its performer and its message , could be encouraging . 
   it 's goddamn absurd that putin actually pouts like a child at this , i do n't know if he is serious about his social conservatism or if it 's just a persona he put on to get votes . 
  when russia had chances of winning the contest with lesbian act t.a.t.u in 2003 there were no complaints from putin , were there ? 
  are the itunes charts of any importance in russia ? 
  because the austrian song is the highest selling eurovision song at the moment in russia , [ at number 9 ] ( http://esctracker.com/ ) , while the russians own song is at number 41 . 
  i can understand why putin is upset about this chance the people are getting at showing their support to lgbt rights . 
  i do n't like eurovision becoming political , but if this song can give a voice to people in support of lgbt rights in russia , i 'm all for it . 
   not that eurovision was ever about actual quality of music . 
  the contest has n't been about quality of music since the mid 1960 's . 
  which is actually why it survived , it 's why it 's entertaining . 
  a serious music competition wo n't be watched by 180 million people , or by anyone really . 
  i myself am a big eurovision fan , but it 's not because of the music . 
  there 's no one i know who watches it just for the songs . 
  not to say there have n't been some memorable songs , but i 'd say no more than 100 out of the more than thousand songs performed in six decades . 
  also if you listen to the winning song this year without looking at the bearded woman , it 's actually pretty decent . 
  not to everyone 's taste , but not bad either , and sung incredibly well . 
  some people like the song only because of the beard , but just as many people immediately dismiss the song the song only because of it . 
  ironically enough the song is very conservative , so the most conservative people should like it the most . 
  it 's too unclear indeed , but maybe what they mean is : i think it 's wrong , but it should n't be forbidden . 
  i think it 's wrong , so it should be forbidden . 
  i do n't think it 's wrong . 
  ah , thanks . 
  i thought i already had . 
  that 's funny , in dutch snavel means beak . 
  as does schnabel in german . 
  how does @ look like a little duck ? 
  i 'm dutch , i do n't think anyone in the us actually cares . 
  nor do i , but i still do n't think it 's exactly appropriate . 
  but then again , if anyone wants to make a cookie in my likeness , i 'd like that very much !, 
   wilders : we need to put a stop to all these criminal moroccans . 
  no , he said : we need to put a stop to moroccans . 
  what he should have said is : we need to put a stop to criminals . 
  the fact that they did n't try to mock him , or be funny , which is the case with caricatures , is what is the inappropriate thing . 
  can you imagine the belgian king visiting the us , and then the belgian embassy getting a cookie that was made to look like him ? 
  - dutch prime minister appeared in children 's news program , at own request , to reassure moroccon kids that they wo n't be deported . 
  because without the racist thing , making a cookie out of a country 's leader is totally appropriate ... 
  what the hell hungary , get with the times !, 
  it 's the muslims who are to blame for everything !, 
  icelands population surviving the next 4 years is killing your buzz ? 
  got any proof for that ? 
  [ eurovision song contest radio ] ( http://www.escradio.com/ ) your question is n't really as clear as you think . 
  do you mean folklorist traditional music ? 
  just non-english music ? 
  or a station that plays abba , nana mouskouri and radiohead ? 
  that 's what people always say about their `` crazy '' papers ( or even all crazy thing in their country ) . 
  apparently people do take these seriously , or they would n't exist . 
  is n't it the third largest paper in spain ? 
  with a daily circulation of over 240,000 ? 
  immigration is equal to replacing people now ? 
  for every new immigrant one german is killed ? 
  something like that ? 
  how does this take away the contrast ? 
  preserving culture does n't make sense , because culture is n't static and is n't set in stone . 
  japanese culture in 1990 was different from japanese culture in 2013 . 
  preserving something made up , at high costs , is at least useless , at most dangerous . 
  but japanese are n't considered racist because of them trying to preserve their culture . 
  it 's about how they think of people from other countries as less than themselves . 
  it 's understandable why many japanese are like this , it 's not that weird to be afraid of something you do n't know . 
  that 's why in cities with large muslim populations , people do n't care about them , but once you go to places with little muslims , people all of a sudden see a big threat . 
  japanese are generally considered to be quite racist , yes . 
  and it 's going to bite them in the ass when their older generation dies out . 
  it all depends on what your definition of lovely is . 
  to us , houses from before the 1920 's seem cute and are like little doll houses . 
  but to the people living in them in those days they were cramped , filthy , unhealthy , dark and shabby . 
  so when they came up with stuff [ like this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/onderlangs_betondorp_amsterdam_5.jpg/800px-onderlangs_betondorp_amsterdam_5.jpg ) in the 1920 's . 
  comfortable , spacious , green , light , affordable housing , it seemed like a blessing to them . 
  people always wonder how old buildings from before the war got demolished over the years . 
  but they forget the living conditions in those houses , before the 1980 's , were below par . 
  then when the car became affordable in later decades , the old cities of the netherlands , not build for cars at all , seemed even more hopelessly obsolete . 
  in the seventies still , people were glad to get out of the cramped old houses and streets of amsterdam , into the new , houses of almere and the [ bijlmermeer ] ( http://www.pieterboersmaphotography.com/archief/bijlmer/slides/hogevecht%20%20bijlmermeer%2002-1971.1981-10.jpg ) . 
  the [ population of amsterdam ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/nl/timeline/f5aa586d25539e186985dfaaea529e92.png ) went from 870,000 in 1963 to 680,00 in 1984 . 
  amsterdam still has n't recovered from that . 
  that 's why there were plans in the 1960 's to turn the canals into motorways . 
  in utrecht they even started with a similar ridiculous plan ( which they 're now trying to turn back ) . 
  i guess i digress . 
  but it shows how places like almere and the sorts did n't come out of nowhere . 
  the old housing , we now think of as charming , just did n't work either in those days . 
  to us now it seems the other way around . 
  i guess it 's a case of the grass is always greener on the other side . 
  like how people from the country long for the city and vice versa . 
  even in amsterdam , most people do n't live in those canal houses you mentioned . 
  i grew up in something [ like this ] ( http://imganuncios.mitula.net/woonhuis_noorderkroon_amstelveen_98290481686212986.jpg ) . 
  a contemporary variation might look [ like this ] ( http://payload57.cargocollective.com/1/2/94826/3440516/vinex_claudiakorpadi.jpg ) . 
  lots of people live [ in these ] ( http://www.inruilwoning.nl/registreren/images/userfiles/u295-h305-f1.jpg ) . 
  nowadays these [ retro 1930 's houses ] ( http://www.verkuylen.nl/projecten/woning_07.jpg ) are popular , i think . 
  you have to understand it 's not the religion that makes anyone do anything . 
  mentally troubled people do bad stuff and then use their religion to justify it . 
  but this can be any religion or ideology . 
  that 's why million of muslims never hurt anyone and it 's still news when one does . 
  i know i 'm talking to a wall .
