  beaches and water sports, 
  could you list the cities you visited based on best to worst ? 
  ** the netherlands ** ** drenthe ** no one wants to live here , but mostly farmers live here . 
  ** flevoland ** flat , dull , no shared values and flat and dull ** friesland ** think they have their own country . 
  not everyone knows how to speak dutch . 
  hardworking stubborn people that are obsessed with skating . 
  ** gelderland ** friendly farmers . 
  area with minimum stress where people are stressed very easily . 
  ** groningen ** province full of xenophobe unfriendly farmers , stiff people , poor socialists , do n't like change and are pessimistic . 
  do n't like foreigners and do n't even like people from holland . 
  city of groningen is where people go to study and then leave . 
  ** limburg ** easy to corrupt , not so intelligent , xenophobes . 
  area with lots of ` mountains ' and some castles . 
  talk like belgium .

  place where germany tourists go .

  the major problem with the eenvandaag opiniepanel is that there is no control of the validity of the candidates . 
  anyone can fill in anything in . 
  i could say i am a 19-year-old girl with children between the ages of 13 and 15 , living in the province of groningen in the city amsterdam . 
  there is no check in place . 
  which makes the results even less accurate than what de hond does . 
  i understand and that is why i would love to get my hands on the research papers to see the method used and to see if they have done research to understand why they do not feel comfortable holding hands in public . 
  unfortunately , they would not send it to me . 
  this image is healthily altered . 
  [ this is the same area in google maps . 
  ] ( www.google.nl/maps/place/westerdok,+1013+amsterdam/@52.3847238,4.8902646,18z/ ), 
  let me try to explain what i intended to say . 
  we as a dutch society tent to be direct and tent to generally value people that are not very outgoing . 
  that is why we have sayings as `` doe maar gewoon , dan doe je al gek genoeg '' and `` wie het hoofd boven het maaiveld uitsteekt , wordt zijn kop eraf gehakt '' walking hand in hand as an adult , heterosexual or homosexual can result in friends or strangers looking at you differently or making remarks . 
  yet this directness is not always meant as harmful . 
  that directness also applies to heterosexuals . 
  being direct is not something that we as a society discriminate about . 
  try walking hand it hand and kissing in public as an heterosexual adult and i am sure you will get remarks from friends and family as `` act normal '' or `` get a room '' or `` look at these guys thinking they are kids '' or `` do n't be so disgusting '' . 
  it is not a coincidence that thinks such as `` just act normal , that is crazy enough '' and `` whose head is above the crowd , will get his head cut off . '', 
  are typical dutch sayings . 
  expressing things with no intention whatsoever of harming them is very dutch and can be seen harsh by other people . 
  are you talking about [ east-european ] ( http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/side_a_rainbow_europe_map_-2015_a3_image.png ) or [ africa and asia ] ( http://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/legacy/2014/02/05/olympic_tolerance.jpg ) ? 
  ironically , in many muslim-dominated countries it is very common for men to walk hand in hand and greet each other by kissing . 
  yet not allowed when people of the opposite sex do it . 
  i can not remember seeing adult 's bike hand in hand . 
  perhaps it is because i live in a bigger city . 
  no , unless you are a young teenager , but even then it is not common . 
  as a dutch man , i am surprised about the outcome . 
  i contacted the organization that did the research to find out more about the methods used and exact questions used . 
  they refused to send me a copy :( for anyone interested . 
  in 2008 there was a research done called '' [ terug in de kast ? 
  ] ( http://www.art1middennederland.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/terugindekast.pdf ) '' which translates in to `` back in the closet ? '', 
  where 78 % of homosexual couples said they did not feel safe walking had in hand and would adjust their behavior to feel safe . 
  their perception was that people would act differently or even verbally or physically attack them if they walked hand in hand . 
  the dutch association for homosexuals did an experiment and turned out that in nearly all cases there was nothing to fear and that it was the perception of the people . 
  in the same way that people are afraid to go jogging in the woods at night for fear of being raped or killed . 
  but the reality is that if you go jogging at night in the woods the chances of getting raped or killed are nearly non-existing . 
  since 18 % of the economy of spain is a shadow economy . 
  a part of those unemployed could have a job , just not a job that pays taxes .

  [ this video explains why these things are popular .

  the source is the social media page of one person claiming it . 
  [ basically this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abkebp4p0jq ), 
  as stated on the website of ehic  does ** not guarantee free services ** . 
  as each country 's healthcare system is different services that cost nothing at home might not be free in another country . 
  why ? 
  what is the story behind it ? 
  it is based on john 8:57  so the jews said to him , `` you are not yet fifty years old , and have you seen abraham ? '', 
  interesting enough the tradition with the dolls is only a few generations old . 
  since the average age [ for men is 34,8 and 32,2 for women ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_at_first_marriage#cite_note-unece-12 ) this must be something that happens to many people . 
  what is the origin of this tradition ? 
   pool party : one party goer will have woken up disappointed after realising he missed the opportunity to jump in the bath with four women , as he was too busy sleeping on the toilet join a bath with 4 naked women or put your head on a toilet . 
  hard choice he had to make . 
  30750 asylum applications from syria to be exact . 
  [ most are from kosovo ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/bd/five_main_citizenships_of_first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_1st_quarter_2015.png ) last year , [ they where also mostly from kosovo ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/b7/five_main_citizenships_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants%2c_2014_%28number%2c_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iii.png ), 
  renault has a 43.4 % controlling stake in nissan and the french government owns 19.7 % of renault . 
  resulting in more government contracts and more positive endorsements for nissan compared to toyota . 
  resulting in increasing sales for nissan for the past few years . 
  that is not the main thing . 
  nissan has been making some very successful cars for the last few years . 
  including the qashqai, 
  the prison population of san marino was just 2 . 
  [ here you can see it for your country . 
  ] ( http://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison-population-total?field_region_taxonomy_tid=14 ), 
  that slogan `` very strong in damage work '' as if isis deliberately stole ( or bought ) it . 
  in this case , it is not about student benefits . 
  it is about national and eu funds that do not look at personal wealth . 
  btw you do not need to own the car . 
  you can setup a foundation that owns the car ( without paying all the taxes ) and provides the car to you in the form of charity . 
  in fact , you can get subsidies for that foundation to buy the car . 
  in essence , these funds are created for people from poor families who have the intelligence to attend university but not the funds . 
  in reality , those people ( especially the ones from developing countries ) do not even know these things exist . 
  those that do do n't always have the knowledge to correctly fill in the paper work . 
  so they get abused by those who can , such as the people with lawyers and accountants to fill them .
