  same case with other subsidies . 
  our queen gets millions of subsidies intended for farmers , so does the british royal family and it has been going on for over a decade . 
  [ take a look at this ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/who-gets-eu-agriculture-subsidies-german-minister-blocking-push-for-transparency-a-621469.html ), 
  at my university , there was a person who got subsidies from the european union and several national culture funds . 
  this resulted in free housing , no tuition , a monthly allowance , payment of books and trips from and back to his parents in the summer . 
  his parents lived in a tax haven outside of the eu and both did not work for a living . 
  so officially , he was from a low-income family outside of the eu and fitted the profile to get financial aid . 
  everybody knew he was not poor , as he owned a big range rover , which was clearly noticed by the staff . 
  last year turkey had 1.680.000 refugees . 
  iran had to deal with 982.000 . 
  lebanon , a country with a population of 4,5 million had to deal with 500.000 . 
  in 2014 there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide . 
  a 17,5 % increase compared to 2013 . 
  it is an international crisis that needs to be fixed at its core . 
  there would be a few million budget . 
  but 80 % of it would be spend on meetings where people get to argue about which country and which parts of the country should be in the video and in which order . 
  then the budget will need to be doubled . 
  from that 50 % would be spend on more meetings and 60 % on the eu representatives traveling to all the different europe 's cities ( first class and in 5 star hotels ) . 
  finally more budget would be needed so some firm can create a crappy version of this , which no-one outside of a small group will see . 
  because there would not be enough budget for promoting it . 
  it also depends if refugees are added as in some countries refugees are not allowed to work . 
  so about 98,5 % of ukrainians that seek asylum do it in russia . 
  but also those who do not seek asylum seen to move to russia . 
  taiwan and the netherlands are not only very similar in size . 
  they both have around 25 % arable land and 1 % permanent crops, 
  when you call it out and provide sources , people who want to push a message ( on all sides ) will downvote that . 
  the downvote and upvote have turned into like and dislike . 
   the schwarz group , which started in the 1930s as a grocery wholesaler in germany , is now one of the world 's largest and fastest-growing retailers , and its head , dieter schwarz , is one of the world 's richest men , worth an estimated $ 21bn . 
  how about not giving out any free tax payers money to organization to expand , but reinvesting it in the people . 
  those organizations should use their own money or take out a loan . 
  yet it does not seem to have any effect on prices of 4 and 5 star hotels . 
  the prices if hotels are higher then a few months ago , based on my own observation . 
  this is what you get when you allow all these immigrants from north-africa and middle east . 
  they bring their weather with them . 
  the sharia triangle was made up by a journalist , who got fired for making things up and reporting it as news . 
  interesting that syria was not on that list , despite an large group of syrian refugees in 2013 . 
  denmark has one of the lowest naturalization rates with 0.5 % . 
  last year from the 626.000 refugees who applied , only 24.000 officially got to stay [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) this year , in q1 there where 185.000 applications . 
  26 % from kosovo , 16 % from syria and the percentage from sudan and lebanon where under 1 % . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6887997/3-18062015-cp-en.pdf/4457b050-26f9-4cf1-bf27-9ffb73ff8c7b ) you ca n't send people back to syria or other countries in war . 
  the problem is not refugees who get to stay , as the amount that gets to stay was 24.000 in 2014 and that was a record year . 
  the problem is illegals , which illegally move around in europe and because they have no source of income , they have to do illegal things to survive . 
  another problem is that it takes too long to process people ( for various reasons ) . 
  while more come , the number being processed keeps on increasing . 
  it went from 350.000 in january 2014 to 500.000 in january 2015 . 
  while it is very profitable for certain individuals and companies ( one of the reasons it takes too long to process ) it is a burden on governments who already have a hard time due to the financial crisis . 
  indeed, 
  it 's even cheaper if you are famous . 
  do n't have to pay in a lot of places because e people ` know ' you . 
  interesting that belgium is higher than the netherlands . 
  it used to be common for people from the netherlands to move to belgium because of lower taxes and more affordable homes . 
  it could also be that the belgium has less non tax gdp while having a lower tax . 
  and every news outlet seems to publish everything they say and do . 
  they seem to have a powerful pr . 
  did buzzfeed start writing titles for cnn ? 
  it is worse here between 01:00 and 06:00 cet . 
  my guess is that none-europeans from certain groups have discovered this subreddit . 
  you should look at the comments in / r/news one of the top comments was that all muslims in europe should be put in prison camps . 
  not sure if they are neo-nazis or isis supports . 
  both seem to want to radicalize people . 
  what makes you think that france has so many terrorist ? 
  there have been 2 attacks this year , but the number of attacks is not the same as the number of terrorists . 
  imagine how bad it was to flying in the 80s . 
  in the netherlands it has been on the decline since the 80s when about 40 % of the people smoked daily . 
  in 2004 it was 28 % and in 2014 it was 19 % . 
  16 % of people with a high education smoke and 27 % with a low education . 
  it is not cool or fashionable among teenagers and adults . 
  [ here are the latest european stats from oecd ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-europe-2014/daily-smoking-rates-among-adults-2012-and-change-2002-12-or-nearest-years_health_glance_eur-2014-graph40-en#page1 ), 
  i was thinking the same thing . 
  that site does have a lot of strange sensational articles . 
  local data shows something else . 
  the average income before taxes in 2013 was [ 33.600 euro ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=71511ned&amp;d1=a&amp;d2=a&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=a&amp;vw=t ) . 
  making the net earnings 24.192 euro . 
  much lower than what this chart shows . 
  these could be the annual earnings , but they are too high for net earnings . 
  the focus of the program was to show the mismanagement . 
  from strange costs , such as the example i made . 
  to incompetence , such as spending 75 million for bus station which was not high enough for the busses to enter !, 
  the focus was not to punish the people who did the mismanagement . 
  as far as i recall , nothing happened to the people responsible . 
  this is very common practice . 
  there have been many example where at best people just step down . 
  many examples of whistleblowers having their life ruined for coming forward . 
  this form of corruption is institutionalized and legalized and thus not considered corruption . 
  the people responsible for the ` mismanagement ' are protected by contract and law that they are not responsible for their mistakes . 
  as it is not seen as corruption , but simple mismanagement or a lack of proper insight . 
  there used to be a tv show in the netherlands about such waste . 
  it was called `` over de balk '' and would look at wasteful projects and money that was disappearing . 
  they would find very suspicious projects . 
  i remember one time a government organization had spent 1.2 million on building 8 lamps on a road . 
  when they asked offers of companies that could build such a project . 
  the estimate was 10.000 to 20.000 . 
  a lot of shady things happen when people can get ` free ' money without any consequences if they ` mismanaged ' the funds . 
  at worst they just resign and get a different post . 
  if you look at percent of population and look at total , then in both cases it is not true . 
  according to the [ un ] ( http://esa.un.org/unmigration/timsa2013/data/subsheets/un_migrantstock_2013t3.xls ) . 
  europe 9,8 % of its population are migrant workers , north america is 14,9 % and oceania is 20,7 % . 
  there are 7,3 billion people worldwide . 
  20 % would be 1,46 billion . 
  the whole population of europe is 0,57 billion .
