   more than 600,000 people sought refugee status in europe last year 625.920 to be exact . 
  but only 23.295 got a positive final decision . 
  do you have any source for that ? 
  the only sentence regarding asylum seekers on the bbc article is the one you quoted . 
  rejected asylum seekers are a major contributor to illegal immigration . 
  in the first round about 55 % get rejected http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_instance_decisions_on_ ( non-eu ) _ asylum_applications , _ 2014 _ ( number , _ rounded_figures ) _ yb15_iv . png and in the final decision 82 % get rejected http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_instance_decisions_on_ ( non-eu ) _ asylum_applications , _ 2014 _ ( number , _ rounded_figures ) _ yb15_iv . png about 8 % get to stay . 
  part of that 92 % that get rejected are send back . 
  but a portion do n't get send back and become illegal . 
  the people coming to west-europe , whether coming on boats , by car or going with a backpack in the jungle of hungry . 
  the vast majority wants to apply for asylum to be a resident and be able to profit from the advantage and freedoms . 
  serbians nationals where one of the top origins of none eu asylum seekers in 2013 and 2014 . http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:countries_of_origin_of_ ( non-eu ) _ asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states , _ 2013_and_2014_yb15_iii . png, 
  a lot of these companies are not startups . 
  some of them are up to 17 years old . 
  the population growth of africa is a major problem for the countries in africa and outside of africa . 
  they went from 500 million in 1987 to 1.100 million in 2012 and are expected to reach 1.500 million in 2025 . 
  last december 3500kg of cocaine was ceased in the netherlands . 
  a professor that does research on the price of drugs said that it would hardly effect the price . 
  i imagine that loosing 500kg of heroin for the total heroin trade is not enough to effect it . 
  is n't part of being muslim that you can not drink alcohol ? 
  * move to alcoutim when your wife is 8 months pregnant * collect 5000 euro after birth * move away from alcoutim, 
  it could also be that most people want to solve the problem with diplomacy . 
  also , about 44 % of the people they asked where 55 years and older . 
  15 % where 65 + . 
  do n't think lots of 60 year olds want to go to war . 
  only 10 % of the people they asked in morocco where 55 years and older . 
  are n't men in morocco allowed to have multiple wives ? 
  are n't women allowed in the moroccan army ? 
  if both answers are no . 
  then russia and thailand are going to have competition in terms of mail bride companies . 
  in what context is this asked ? 
  if they ask people in the netherland in the context of the war in iraq . 
  then it is not surprising that this is low . 
  but if the context is that that the nsdap are back in power and germany just started attacking us . 
  the % will be much higher . 
  it depends on the country . 
  some countries have a more affordable european package . 
  you can really do a lot with free wifi . 
  lots of hotels and restaurants offer it and some small cities offer it . 
  if you are doing it for navigation , get an offline option such as nokia here . 
  nokia here maps is a great free offline navigation software with maps , public transportation and other information . 
  drei.at has european prepaid data cards if you need that . 
  that is because reddit did not post it as it was a reply to a deleted post . 
  a post that is now undeleted . 
  is there a source of what the judge said within the full context ? 
  is there any source other than the telegraph , daily mail , daily express and others who use the same syndication ? 
  we did not leave syria alone . 
  lookup friends of syria , which is modeled after friends of libya . 
  ( i had a long reply with sources , but since a mod deleted every comment here , it would not publish and was lost . ), 
  really !, 
  which part of the netherlands is that ? 
  i really do n't understand . 
  the top comment was something in the line of `` i wish we had not bombed libya '' with a reply `` and iraq and syria '' . 
  nothing that is against the rules of reddit of / r/europe . 
  do n't understand why they where all deleted . 
  we should contact the mods !, 
  or you could use a [ nuts-2 map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/nuts_2_regions_eu-27.svg/1039px-nuts_2_regions_eu-27.svg.png ), 
  with the charlie hebdo shooting fresh in our memory , i can image most people would think of that . 
  for the last decades the deathliest attracts in the netherlands have not been attacks by extreme islamists . 
  yet they did not get as much media attention and yearly media recurrence as the ones that were . 
  they were not . 
  there was an actual discussion going on . 
  instead of the normal `` it is an invasion '' or `` how is multiculturalism working out for you '' , or `` we should sink the boats before they arrive '' type of posts by new accounts that get lots of upvotes and then disappear . 
  or accounts that usually only post whiterights , european and other such subreddits . 
  perhaps it is part of the reddit crackdown on vote manipulation accounts . 
  nope . 
  the netherlands , not latin and yet 3 kisses . 
  what just happend to this topic ? 
  why have so many accounts been deleted ? 
  [ this image from the shooting ] ( http://nos.nl/data/image/2015/06/09/165212/xxl.jpg ) and the shooting was near a school where children witnessed it !, 
  our motorcycle gangs are not a real big problem and really not big players in terms of crime , especially murders . 
  they are also called 1 % clubs , because 99 % of their members do nothing illegal . 
  it is the organized crime syndicates that have assassination on a weekly basis . 
  usually with deadly precision and rarely any innocent bystanders . 
  our minister of safety and justice had to step down because of lying about laundering money for a crime boss , which was done by our secretary of state of justice . 
  shockingly it was not considered a crime for the government to launder money for a crime boss . 
  last year we had 137 murders and 24 of them where liquidations . 
  for us a big deal , but nothing compared to a country like the us who had 14.000 to 15.000 murders . 
  most of the liquidations are still liked to [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/willem_holleeder ) and [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/willem_endstra ), 
  dutch organized crime . 
  the only time they are 2nd are in polls carried out by de hond . 
  in which election have they been 2nd ? 
  the pew research marketing team sure have discovered reddit . 
  the same things from different sources leading to them keep on getting posted and get dozens of upvotes within minutes of getting posted . 
  we are slowly taking what could have been ours after wwii . 
  it 's not only italy . 
  he is not anti-immigrants . 
  he is anti-islam . 
  his wife is from hungry . 
  do n't forget that our king , queen and their children are considered allochtone according to the dutch definition .

  as far as i understand . 
  the school director banned a few girls for wearing a long skirt . 
  as a protest the rest of the girls started wearing long skirts . 
  i do n't think any nation should use saudi arabia as an example for human rights . 
  gulf cooperation council countries have offered zero resettlement places to syrian refugees . 
  according to the un there are 664 refugees and asylum seekers in saudi arabia . 
  [ turkey 1.76 million according to the un ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=224 ) [ lebanon 1.18 million according to the un ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=122 ) [ egypt 0.13 million according to the un ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=122 ) [ 0.25 million applications in europe ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/asylum.php ), 
  perhaps they define tourist differently . 
  there are 761.000 british residents in spain . 
  if they travel to and from spain 3x a year .
