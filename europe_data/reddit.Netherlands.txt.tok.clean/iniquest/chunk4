  then you suddenly have 2.3 million tourists who stay at their own homes in spain and spend less . 
  some countries define it based on the hotel night stays per person . 
  others on the amount of people who travel to the country . 
  i am not sure if there is an eu standard . 
  taxes are also an important part . 
  there is much more tax benefit and more net income for 2 people working 24 hours , than for one person working 48 hours at the same hour wage . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  germany did not get 1.000.000 immigrants in the past 3 years . 
  according to eurostat and bamf it has been 407.000 and 203.000 of them where send back . 
  it is 204.000 in the last 3 years and the biggest group are christians from syria , followed by christians from serbia . 
  in 2014 denmark had less than [ 15 thousand applications ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/2/2d/five_main_citizenships_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants%2c_2014_%28number%2c_rounded_figures%29_yb15_ii.png ) and only a fraction of those get to stay in the country . 
  1 miljoen in 3 years never happend . 
  thank you . 
  mostly negative about ukrainians and russians . 
  why is that ? 
  that is interesting , specially due to the high numbers and past tensions . 
  ida-viru and harju seem very popular among russians . 
  do they identify them selfs as russians , or do they view them selfs as estonians ? 
  interesting to see that most of the people moving to estonia are former ussr countries . 
  according to stat.ee there are less than 20 africans living there . 
  can you please translate [ this chart ] ( http://www.sanep.cz/repository/grafy/sanep_teroristicke_utoky_v_evrope_11_3.jpg ) ? 
  ethnic groups according to the cia * estonian 68.7 % * russian 24.8 % * ukrainian 1.7 % * belarusian 1 % * finn 0.6 % * other 1.6 % * unspecified 1.6 % how does the general public view russians and ukrainians living in estonia ? 
  i wonder in what situation one would need 1 gb/s now . 
  perhaps in a fews years . 
  i downgraded from 200/40 to 130/30 and have never experienced a moment that i found it too slow . 
  yet it saves met 120 euro a year . 
  sure . 
  these are the dutch sources . 
  [ 78 page police report ] ( https://www.politieacademie.nl/kennisenonderzoek/kennis/mediatheek/pdf/89392.pdf ) [ this news item ] ( http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/binnenland/oost-europese-criminelen-overspoelen-nederland ) this easter to translate and so is [ this news item ] ( http://www.panorama.nl/blog/magazine-blog/steeds-meer-oost-europese-criminelen-nederland ) if you look at where people come from . 
  cbs shows . 
  netherlands antilles heritage 5.6 % where suspected of a crime moroccan 4.5 % where suspected of a crime east european 2.9 % where suspected of a crime . 
  this are people who have officially registered as a citizen . 
  if you count the people who travel to the netherlands and not register . 
  the estimated number is 4.2 % . 
  this is the fastest growing group . 
  the interesting thing is that crime among non-natives has been declining for years . 
  specially among people from the middle-eastern and north african countries . 
  according to [ the cbs and the dutch police ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rgzerkb.png ) . 
  cbs is the central statistic agencies and klpd is our national police . 
  my point is : economical immigrants ( which both groups are ) will come in search of a better job and better life , even if their country is not ` fucked up ' . 
  if african countries where less ` fucked up ' the very risky boat migration might reduce , but people will still find a way . 
  perhaps with less people on a better boat , or by submarine if there is enough money in it !, 
  for thousands of years people have migrated in search of a better life . 
  such as the huge migration from europe to us and canada . 
  even when a country is not ` fucked up ' people will do it . 
  africa has a population of 1.2 billion . 
  it is projected to be 1.4 billion in 2020 . 
  even without wars , there would be hundreds of thousands looking for a brighter future in europe . 
  you hit the spot with mentally in a different category . 
  if you look at statistics in the netherlands crime rate is the highest for people from netherlands antilles . 
  if you look at the most rapid growing group and the most violent it is from eastern-europe . 
  if you look at most car accidents due to drunk driving , people from eastern-europe are by far the highest ranking . 
  in terms of crime rate asylum seekers score lower than any other group . 
  yet mentally people experience it differently . 
  perhaps the best and brightest but it could also be the most ruthless who are willing to do anything to get out . 
  in the netherlands the biggest group of immigrants by far are people from poland . 
  their numbers are 5x higher than the second group , which are people from syria . 
  and these are registered immigrants from poland . 
  if you include the number of unregistered immigrants ( people who come here just to work and do n't officially register ) the number would double . 
  poland is not a fucked up country . 
  [ here is a graph including dutch description . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4mkhftf.png ) the problem is complex , that is why there is no easy solution to the eu immigration problem and especially when it comes to the problem of people coming from north africa and turkey by boat . 
  this topic is not about the ones the come from boats to italy . 
  it is about europe in general . 
  according to eurostat for italy the top 3 are nigeria , mali and gambia . 
  the total amount of immigrants from syria have been 14x higher since the war there . 
  syria is by far the main country and was the number 1 country of origin in 2013 and 2014 according to [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a4/countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states%2c_2013_and_2014_yb15_ii.png ) . 
  in 2014 there where 123 thousand from syria vs 37 thousand from eritrea . 
  ethiopia was less than 5 thousand . 
  before the war libya gdp - per capita ( ppp ) was [ $ 24,700 ] ( https://www.cia.gov/llibrary/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2004.html#ly ) . 
  major government funds have been cut and the poor have become desperate . 
  gdp - per capita ( ppp ) of $ 24,700 was along with countries such as greece and portugal and higher than most east european countries . 
  people from other african countries would migrate to libya . 
  are you sure about that !, 
  the un stats that there is no proof that gadafi tried to air strike a crowd of protesters . 
  between 13 and 16 january 2011 , upset at delays in the building of housing units and over political corruption , protesters in bayda , derna , benghazi and other cities broke into , and occupied , housing that the government had been building . 
  protesters also clashed with police in bayda and attacked government offices . 
  by 27 january , the government had responded to the housing unrest with a $ 20 billion investment fund to provide housing and development . 
  total protests decreased , but the violent ones by rebels increased . 
  on the 25th of february human rights watch said that at least 233 people had been killed in the libyan government 's crackdown on protests and fresh violence erupted after strongman moamer kadhafi 's son warned the country faces civil war . 
  the arming and training of rebels ( by qatar , france and the uae ) started before the civil war . 
  and if you look at civilian casualties . 
  more people were killed because of the war and by the rebels the west supported , than by the government of libya . 
  there were much bigger [ protests in bahrain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bahraini_uprising_of_2011 ) . 
  100.000 to 300.000 protestors in a country of 1.300.000 people !, 
  the reaction of the government was much more violent than in libya . 
  yet no international intervention and hardly any media coverage . 
  the two countries currently responsible for the most refugees coming to europe are the same two countries that we helped into a mess . 
  since the war in libya gdp - per capita ( ppp ) has gone from $ 24,700 to $ 16,600 . 
  major government funds have been cut and the poor have become desperate . 
  according to the un over 10 million syrians have fled their homes . 
  3.9 million of them went to turkey , lebanon , jordan , iraq and egypt . 
  0.2 million to europe . 
  there are also more than 2 million refugees from libya that went to neighboring countries such as tunisia and less than 0.1 million to europe . 
  strangely the same people who are in favor of booming countries and arming ( isis ) rebels . 
  are the same people who are surprised that immigration increased due to the wars . 
  like you said . 
  we really fucked up there ... or better our governments and special interest groups really fucked up there . 
  wo n't the camps be flooded with immigrants ? 
  according to the un over 10 million syrians have fled their homes .
