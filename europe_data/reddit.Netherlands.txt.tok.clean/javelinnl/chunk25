  it 's like the way europe is dealing with putin , we 're playing checkers , he 's boxing . 
  i did n't call them legos , i called them legos . 
  see ? 
  did n't even capitalize it !, 
  is that a video of the decoy car they sent ? 
  pretty cheeky of them to turn that into an anti-dutch thing . 
  we should sell them dutch flags . 
  and oranges . 
  i mean , why not make a quick ~ ~ buck ~ ~ euro coin , right ? 
  real dutch wares , get them while they 're hot ... and apparently about to get considerably hotter !, 
  yay , `` our '' sister club . 
  when the stadium collapsed during an unfortunate renovation accident , they immediately offered our boys to train in theirs . 
  top lads , true gentlemen . 
  this was hardly a neutral video just encouraging people to vote and i very much suspect these people do n't know the first thing about the dutch electoral system . 
  i do n't mind other views and insights , as long as they have a proper foundation . 
  this , this is n't that , just the usual anglo style liberal hysteria , as seen on the rest of reddit . 
  and that 's something the european left can do without . 
  so the `` be informed '' part is pretty hypocritical . 
  so . . if someone were to vote for wilders , how evil would they be on a scale of 1 to 10 megahitlers ? 
  got ta stop those evil mysoginist populists and their fake news and alt-right hackers !, 
  i 'm glad that videos like this make progressives out to be such openminded and reasonable people and i really appriciate a foreigner educating me on what my political options and opinions should be . 
  thanks dudes , you 're a gift that never stops giving . 
  first legos , now this !, 
  hell , you ride bicycles so you 're even * civilized * . 
  is n't that just a negotiation tactic ? 
  you should pay us !, 
  * no , you should pay * us !, 
  ultimately ending somewhere in the middle . 
  hopefully . 
  in a stellar display of reasonable and adult behavior , the dutch flag has been removed from the consulate and [ replaced with a turkish one ] ( http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/buitenland/provocatie-in-turkije-rel-turkse-vlag-boven-nederlands-consulaat ) . 
  - edit - the dutch flag has returned . 
  turks upset , accuse dutch of `` spawncamping '' , will `` noscope noobs '' on next round . 
  they 're going to do something stupid like arresting a bunch of random dutch nationals , are n't they . 
  wilders is n't a fascist though and the sp is n't communist . 
  they 're more alike than different . 
  `` peace in our time '', 
  the refugee deal , according to dutch journalists in brussels . 
  he keeps creating new streams every time he restarts . 
  that 's why i said 2 , i might vote for them so i did n't want to exclude them , 
  that sounds awesome . 
  how do they decide which party gets which ministry though ? 
  biggest gets to choose first ? 
  they 're one of the main reasons why the dutch political landscape is so fractured right now , and the system is n't designed for so many parties . 
  it gets ... wait for it ... clogged !, 
  and here 's the latest development in this cat and mouse game , a turkish minister is trying to still hold a rally by going by car instead of an airplane , this was countered by allowing her to enter the consulate , because she has diplomatic immunity ... but to restrict other people from getting there . 
  - edit - apparently , her convoy just got stopped by the police . 
  - edit edit - ~ ~ livestream ~ ~ at consulate ( now live again ) - edit x3 - dutch public broadcaster is now saying that turkish media are calling on dutch turks to join the protest . 
  - edit x4 - more and more protesters , atmosphere is getting grim . 
  - edit x5 - surprise , surprise . 
  dutch ambassador no longer welcome in ankara . 
  - edit x6 - new ~ ~ stream ~ ~ , apparently over 1000 people now ~ ~ and a possible stabbing ? ~ ~ unconfirmed - edit x7 - turkish tv [ stream ] ( http://www.trthaber.com/canli-yayin-izle.html ) , police taking up positions . 
  - edit x8 - turkish minister of family affairs : `` netherlands is violating all international laws , conventions and human rights by not letting me enter turkish consulate in rotterdam '' . 
  i think she 's a bit upset . 
  ~ ~ new stream ~ ~ - edit x9 - speech started at consulate anyway , not entirely clear who is speaking . 
  - edit x10 - police apparently getting into action now . 
  - edit x11 - turkish tv plays up all the drama , painting the dutch police as monsters . 
  dutch state tv downplayed the events and muted out the chanting . 
  ~ ~ new stream ~ ~ - edit x12 - minister exited her car to enter the consulate , stopped by police , returned to car . 
  she is still upset . 
  crowd is upset as well . 
  - edit x13 - the local pro-erdogan party just reached out to the media to comment on current events . 
  they state they have no comment . 
  - edit x14 - a bit more serious , the police is apparently going to start charging . 
  or just postering ? 
  [ stream ] ( https://www.periscope.tv/w/1ynxapplbnwjj ) - edit x15 - police . . apparently surrounded the ministers car , might break it open ? 
  strange news but from a [ reliable newspaper ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/03/11/turkse-minister-tegengehouden-bij-rotterdams-consulaat-a1549924 ) - edit x16 - rip livestream , battery out of power . 
  thank you streammandude . 
  - edit x17 - turkish minister arrested by dutch police according to two sources . 
  apparently because her bodyguards were armed . 
  ohhhhh boy . 
  - edit x18 - nope , she was n't arrested , just 8 diplomats she had with her . 
  minister remains in car , still upset . 
  crowd likes chanting allahu akbar . 
  and apparently do n't like jews . 
  - edit x19 - emergency measures extended to whole city center - rotterdam municipal press release . 
  - edit x20 - minister - is - getting arrested and possibly deported to germany . 
  - edit x21 - minister refuses to leave armored car . 
  car is being towed away . 
  she 's still upset . 
  - final edit - riots !, 
  dutch police chopper is following minister to make sure she leaves the country . 
  never a dull time in the 21st century , eh ? 
  - final stealth edit - ok , so apparently there were several decoy cars sent by the turks to mislead dutch authorities . 
  you ca n't make this shit up . 
  not really . 
  a party like the cda ( christian democrats ) might under other circumstances , there are other small right wing groups , i can even see the socialist party working with him , but given the total number of parties needed to get 76 + seats , and how virtually all `` major '' parties have declared they do n't want to cooperate with him , including the vvd , nr 2/1 in the polls and a previous natural ally , there is zero chance of him getting into a position of power . 
  first-past-the-post is what is wrecking the us , not the threshold imho . 
  although i agree that 5 % would be an overkill to introduce in our system . 
  2 % seems more reasonable , 3 seats ? 
  perhaps 2 ? 
  just to prevent those single person splinter parties . 
  there are no second rounds , we - always - have coalition . 
  the biggest party tries to form that coalition with others and usually supplies the pm , it does n't always work out that way though , you can be the biggest but if the others form a coalition without you , you 're sol . 
  the king used to be involved in this process , but his role was abolished a few years ago . 
  - edit - oh and you do n't vote * directly * on a pm , you vote for an mp and the party this person belongs to . 
  yay !, 
  we 're * special * !, 
  a grand total of 28 parties have registered to take part in the elections , i wonder how big the ruling coalition will have to be . 
  hope it gets limited to 5 or less , it 'd be * so * messy otherwise . 
  i 'd like to believe that , but with the banning of ypg symbols ( our allies ! ),
