  because otherwise , it 'll be like european federalization , without a concrete roadmap or plans to address the fact that some nations would never join a federal europe , there 's just not much to trust about an institution like that , either they scheme in the dark or they muck about without knowing what they 're doing . 
  some actual leadership would be nice , democratic legitemacy through the ep would be nice , but as it stands it ca n't even tackle the moving to strassbourg thing . . 
  i hope i 'm wrong btw . 
  i can see the `` european dream '' , i just do n't believe in it any more . 
  i think i 'd like to though . . 
  damn you finland . 
  damn you . 
  hang on , i disagree with you on grouping the likes of le pen and wilders together with golden dawn and neo-nazi movements , the difference being that they do n't call for violent methods . 
  conflating them is like piling socialists ( not social democrats , actual socialists ) and stalin together , it 's just not the same thing . 
  fair enough . 
  i guess you 're right in that it 's like arguing over what is better , rape or murder . 
  oh , yes , maybe i 'm giving the impression i 'm a nazi apologist somehow here , i 'm not . 
  well , sure , if you include the nazi 's . 
  i 'm talking a bit more recently though . 
  [ i ca n't find the original source anymore and it 's driving me crazy . 
  anyway , this is a poor approximation , because it does n't break down the numbers , like deaths etc ] ( https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3a%2f%2fupload.wikimedia.org%2fwikipedia%2fcommons%2fthumb%2f9%2f9a%2fterrorist_attacks_in_the_eu_by_affiliation.png%2f420px-terrorist_attacks_in_the_eu_by_affiliation.png&amp;imgrefurl=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fterrorism_in_europe&amp;docid=6qdfipuzz1jsam&amp;tbnid=isnoaeffocganm%3a&amp;vet=1&amp;w=420&amp;h=270&amp;bih=670&amp;biw=1024&amp;q=left%20wing%20vs%20right%20wing%20terrorism%20europe%20statistics&amp;ved=0ahukewjx-vvqqmlrahxdwcwkhcoocsqqmwgdkaiwag&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8 ), 
  europol , ca n't find the link though , otherwise i would have included it in my original post . 
  not for a lack of trying though and it 's pissing me off . 
  it was n't a report ... 
  i think . 
  anyway , here 's a [ graph from wikipedia ] ( https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3a%2f%2fupload.wikimedia.org%2fwikipedia%2fcommons%2fthumb%2f9%2f9a%2fterrorist_attacks_in_the_eu_by_affiliation.png%2f420px-terrorist_attacks_in_the_eu_by_affiliation.png&amp;imgrefurl=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fterrorism_in_europe&amp;docid=6qdfipuzz1jsam&amp;tbnid=isnoaeffocganm%3a&amp;vet=1&amp;w=420&amp;h=270&amp;bih=670&amp;biw=1024&amp;q=left%20wing%20vs%20right%20wing%20terrorism%20europe%20statistics&amp;ved=0ahukewjx-vvqqmlrahxdwcwkhcoocsqqmwgdkaiwag&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8 ) . 
  that 's a really good point . 
  i ca n't find the source i 'm looking for , it was europol and that 's what i was basing it on , but most violence came from independence movement , by a - lot - , but you 're right , that does n't include the nature of the violence . 
  no , i was just showing that this stereotype that far * right * violence is somehow more prevalent is wrong . 
  each one of those _ by themselves _ are more violent , not lumped together . 
  probably simply because there are more of them , if i had to guess . 
  statistically , the far left , islamists and independance movements are all more likely to be violent then the far right is . 
  the dutch flag will probably appear after the field is done defragging . 
  right , that 's what i meant , they needed to add the uk to even the numbers because of the north not being as densely populated . 
  why on _ earth _ would the entire world isolate it ? 
  yes , boycotting one of the biggest economies on earth that also houses the world 's banking centre and has a permanent seat on the security council and is one of the closest partners of the most powerful country on earth out of pure spite seems like a really good idea that could n't possibly backfire in * any * way whatsoever . 
  no it has n't . 
  the un has classified the baltic states as part of their northern europe group for * years * . 
  also , according to the un themselves , they 're not an authority on naming regions , they just split up europe in groups with a comparable amount of people , so you end up with the uk in northern europe as well . 
  why yes , i - am - fun at parties !, 
  i do n't think anything can top this when it comes to absolute clogginess . 
  so , according to the google translated article , russia is spreading fakenews in sweden and the proof of this is that a think tank ca n't rule out that they - did n't - try to spread it . 
  that 's proving a negative btw , which is impossible . 
  either the original report is garbage , or , also a very likely option , this metro article is , because free publications like this really are the bottom of the barrel . 
  around these here parts , yes . 
  note that i 'm talking * considered * here . 
  yeah , more or less , i think being a native dutch speaker helps . 
  got ta say , i kind of fundamentally disagree with the notion that a right to self-determination has to be `` earned '' in one way or another . 
  also , one could easily argue that when secession is n't allowed in a constitutional way , unilateral action would count as a `` remedy of last resort '' . 
  `` the right to self-determination is appliable by peoples that are actually captivated/opressed '' no it does n't . 
  where on earth are you getting that definition from ? 
  i 'm not saying he was an important part of the nazi apparatus , of course he was n't . 
  that 's not the point , it 's that he - does n't even care - that he was emptying other people 's houses . 
  no sense of guilt or empathy whatsoever . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_wednesday he was trying to do to russia what he did to the uk . 
  congratulations , that means * you * have conscience . 
  his argument is that if he did n't do it , someone else would have , so he does n't bear any personal responsibility . 
  you do n't have to be a communist to hate the likes of george soros . 
  you might want to look up who and what he is , it makes the american allegations of foreign meddling in internal political affairs a lot more amusing . 
  he owns the democratic party , he has politicians in just about every western country on his payroll , he is persona non grata in russia because he tried to crash their economy and the eu had to get his permission to create the euro . 
  he also uses ngo 's to further his own political agenda . 
  and the real kicker : he was a nazi collaborator and describes that period as the happiest time of his life . 
  i 'll refrain from wishing him dead because of legal reasons , but if there are people deserving such a fate on this planet , he 'd be a prime candidate . 
  looks like it , or at least an attempt . 
  probably going to be overshadowed by the turkey news . 
  aaand it 's off to an awful start , hundreds of north africans stopped by police in cologne , a large terror attack in istanbul in a night club with hundreds of people ... christ . 
  i hope 2017 is n't going to be even worse . . 
  ah right , totally forgot about those . 
  i guess i 'm kind of a peasant like that :p . also , happy cake day !, 
  15 languages in the netherlands ? 
  that seems a bit ... overly optimistic . 
  looking at the source , all dialects are counted as separate languages , that should probably be cut down to dutch , frisian , low saxon and limburgish . 
  oh , plus dutch sign language . 
  i think that 's a thing ? 
  [ association of southeast asian nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/association_of_southeast_asian_nations ), 
  ... why is the article accompanied by an image of an officer with a ski mask and a rifle ? 
  * edit * to comment on the contents of the actual article itself and be a bit more relevant : it gets even worse : /  his twin sister was also taken to hospital suffering from mistreatment and malnutrition . 
  fining is exactly what is now being proposed : http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2016/12/17/germany-fine-facebook-e500000-fake-news-post/, 
  just skimmed through the [ eu directive proposal ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=celex:52016pc0593&amp;from=en ) ( skimmed , way too much heavy text for casual reading ) , ca n't see a lot of fair use in there . 
  the text never mentions individuals , only companies and institutions and all in all the text is mostly just focused on compensating rights holders , but would n't existing national laws cover fair use scenario 's ? 
  the outline in the beginning was a bit vague on that . 
   when relevant , and while ensuring that the objectives of the directive are met , room for national decision has been preserved . 
  when the objectives call for `` fair '' compensation , that really does n't help . 
  `` fair '' is n't exactly an objective standard . 
  same thing over here in the netherlands , young people tend to be the eurosceptic ones and pvv voters . 
  that 's assuming polls are `` wrong '' because of error margins though , not because of sloppy non-random samples or implicit or explicit bias by the pollsters . 
  of course they should n't be ignored , there are n't any alternatives , but looking at real world results they seem better suited at just showing trends . 
   sz reports that the `` start-up '' cash for a family of five , if they decide to leave before their asylum claim is rejected , can be $ 4,200 ( # 3,580 ; $ 4,383 ) . 
  that is in addition to the basic financial support that most migrants get from the international organization for migration ( iom ) . 
  so what exactly is preventing people from going to germany for the sole reason of claiming this free money ? 
  no wonder there are record numbers . 
  what 's the fluctuation in water levels like on that location ? 
  if it went from 2.5 m to 1m , that 's kind of a big deal . 
  1.10 to 1 , ehh , not so much . 
  i never said i * trusted * the guy , i 'm aware of the stuff he pulls and why he 's trying to change the constitution . 
  still , you know ... christmas . 
  also , i wish you a merry christmas as well !, 
  and a happy new year . 
  ... golden diamond-studded helicopters ? 
  a little chinese boy as his own personal assistant ? 
  a really neat backscratcher . 
  happy christmas lass , get well soon !, 
  i do n't like him , but screw it , i 'll try not being miserable and cynical if only just for a few days a year . 
  merry christmas to you too mr. erdogan !, 
  may your trees be green and your presents be plentiful .
