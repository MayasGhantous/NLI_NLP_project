  fair enough , i did n't start it though , i was responding to a claim which i thought was just plain stupid . 
  but yea , us and eu situations are very different, 
  except by being in the us illegally , guess what , you 're already a criminal , just not locked up yet . 
   immigrants to the us commit less crimes than natives . 
  now lets look at that number per capita , shall we ? 
  this is the same retarded argument feminists use when talking about the wage gap . 
  if there are more native people in the us , it stands to reason that * in total * they commit more crime, 
  outposts , forts and trade posts, 
  no one needs to be french , to just look at the things going on and then make a judgement about that, 
  oh oh , looks like someone is breaking the sub rules !, 
  btw i voted vvd, 
  are there really that many decendents of europeans in eastern russia ? 
  also fucking lol at turkey being `` disputed '', 
  hmm something something [ `` we will conquer them not through the sword , but through the womb '' ] ( https://books.google.de/books?id=jeaw2w7yqf8c&amp;pg=pa124&amp;lpg=pa124&amp;dq=we+will+conquer+them+not+through+conflict+but+womb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t_oetwj3dq&amp;sig=1stychk-etrnu75tto7fledrz_w&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewij6ug-793sahwljsakha7vayuq6aeijtaa#v=onepage&amp;q=we%20will%20conquer%20them%20not%20through%20conflict%20but%20womb&amp;f=false ), 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-03/germanys-open-door-refugee-problems-12-months-on/7811116 )  more than 30,000 refugees have secured low-paid work in restaurants , in construction or bakeries . 
  a few hundred are doing traineeships . 
   despite more than 660,000 job vacancies , the nation 's biggest companies find the refugees do not have enough skills , and do not speak german . 
  so , 1.2 million migrants , 30.000 jobs filled . 
  woop woop !, 
  i definitely did not see that coming !, 
  seriously , anyone actually suprised by this ? 
  hmm i wonder what they would say !, 
  i feel like some people would prefer a return to soviet style regimes at this point . 
  am i taking crazy pills ? 
  3 centuries ? 
  what ? 
  i do n't know what you mean . 
  muslims where in spain as early as 750 ad . 
  just read [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crusades ) . 
  ever heard of the ice age ? 
  the earth got through that on its own just fine . 
  not saying we should n't do anything about it , but honestly , i have faith in mother nature and her ability to correct things, 
  please calm it with the doomsday thoughts . 
  climate is changing , but the pace with which this is happening , is a lot slower than models from the 90 's would have us believe . 
  first of all , i realise the climate is changing . 
  how fast this is changing , is very debatable . 
  other than that . 
  why do we need globalism to work towards more green energy production ? 
  that just one example though , i meant it in the grand scheme of things . 
  because they had to buddy up with the pvda , they had to lean left a little bit , now that there are more right leaning parties , i hope they stick to that . 
   people are generally good sorry burst you bubble buddy , but not all people are `` good . '', 
  people want what is best for them , not what is best for the collective . 
  we are not the borg from star trek yet ( fortunatly ) do n't forget that globalism will leave a lot of people behind in society , it is not always a good thing, 
  that is how spinning a narrative works . 
  because he was high in the polls , he has `` lost '' according to the left . 
  i hope the vvd take a * harder * conservative course over the next 4 years . 
  the vvd was basically the same as d66 the last 4 years, 
   because in my mind they do n't seem to work together with globalization did it ever occur to you , that some people do n't really want globalism to go overboard ? 
   but if you start to argue that the crusades were justified then you are no better . 
  nobody is saying the crusades were one big party and nothing bad happened . 
  but it was a * reaction * to islamic conquest, 
  til : 6 bankrupties , 50 other succesfull bussinesses = failure and has no leadership i 'd like to see you do better . 
  even if you do inheret a lot of money . 
  haha , already saw it !, 
  have been subscribed to them for over a year now , great videos !, 
  no worries , i deleted it we differ in opinions , shit can get heated . 
  not my first rodeo , haha, 
  i do . 
  but ive been banned twice now and i 'm not keen on being banned again . 
  mind you , that wasnt for insulting anyone , it was for having the wrong opinions , 
  i quoted it, 
  it should tell you , that certain groups of people , have certain tendencies to commit certain acts . 
  it 's just an example statistic . 
  that 's what it should tell you . 
  to jump straight to : dutch police are racist !, 
  is just plain dumb . 
  morrocans , turks and other people with foreign background also work as police men . 
  so i doubt they are racist . 
  great points !, 
  except they only count , for people who actually * join * the fucking workforce !, 
  for this to happen , they have to be housed , fed and educated . 
  and not just for 1 week mind you . 
  more like 5 to 10 years . 
  i think the costs might be a tad bigger than the gains . 
  oh then there is the cultural differences, 
   people should be proud of their actions and not because of certain privileges they were born with . 
  when i look at people i do not see race , gender , sexual orientation , or where they are from . 
  very nice !, 
  neither do i !, 
  but then , when i point out that , for example , that 51 % morrocans between 15 and 24 have come into contact with police , i 'm called a racist or , when i voice my worries or fears about a certain religion or culture , because of their customs and extremes , guess what , i am called a racist again !, 
  how about we fix that first , being able to discuss things without being insulted would be very nice . 
  alright , i hope i run into you guys on a thread where you will finally answer the question then !, 
  looking forward to it !, 
  dodged very nicely . 
  let me know when you feel like answering the question, 
  since it 's clear you all disagree with me and my views . 
  i would like you to answer 1 simple question also posed by another commenter here . 
  how does europe , or germany itself for that matter , benefit from these high rates of immigration from third world countries ? 
   suffer from widespread genetic defects and disorders due to cousin marriage and incest that is so popular in arab culture . 
  i agree this is a bit of a long shot haha . 
  i do n't think there is a lot of evidence supporting this claim also i do n't think we will be intermixed , at the current rate of immigration . 
  but , i do have my reservations about immigration from third world countries . 
  especially if the rates are so high , that we ca n't properly integrate them . 
   ah look a nazi talking about freedom . 
  i see you read [ this book ] ( http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hitler-750.jpg ), 
  exactly , no one in their right mind wants to take away freedom of speech or freedom of religion . 
  but some people are getting desperate . 
  then this is what happens, 
   but feel free to explain to me the benefits of that kind of migration . 
  i would very much like to see your answer to this question .
