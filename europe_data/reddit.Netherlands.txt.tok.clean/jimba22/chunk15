  there is a big difference here . 
  i am not denying that christians or people of other faith commit violence, 
   plenty of christian and even buddhist violence does it really come anywhere near the amount of violence islam commits thought ? 
  what , in your honest opinion , is the best way to deal with terrorism and radicalisation in europe ? 
  pretty sure the death threats are real . 
  and what the hell does his appereance have to do with it ? 
  if people made fun of how hillary or any other female politician looks , they would be called sexists, 
  but they do seem to be over-represented in the recent terror and crime statistics . 
   past or present . 
  please do n't bring up the crusades, 
  good point , i honestly do n't know . 
  because if you were to treat catalonia as it 's own country , people that moved there 40 years ago , would probably have a catalonian passport , and they could vote, 
   any catalan born doesnt this seem the most obvious ? 
  i mean this would mean that you are `` catalonian '' what do you think ? 
  we shall see , after the coming elections, 
  that 's the power of putin and making his people focus more on nationalism than things that actually matter . 
  like their tanking economy, 
  is anyone even suprised anymore ? 
  rest assured that everyone in europe is being monitered and listened to, 
  that 's just outright stupid . 
  men are better at some things , just as women are better at other things, 
   and do n't race each other to the neoliberal bottom . 
  do n't you feel that much of europe has already arrived there ? 
  have they not got some more pressing issues to worry about ? 
   but that looks impossible given the stance of spain 's prime minister mariano rajoy , who said earlier this month that he would not allow a referendum `` that seeks independence and the break-up of spain '' . 
  ofcourse spain would not allow it . 
  so much of their gdp is generated in catalonia, 
  so i guess you missed the part where thousands of african migrants crossed the mediterranean sea to europe ? 
  you are making the classic mistake of thinking these 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants will just magicly renounce their faith , for reasons unknown . 
  this is the same kind of stupid thinking as : when you bring 3rd world migrants into a 1st world country , they will be just like us within a week or so !, 
  wow , of all places , they accuse germany of racism ... 
  the country that let in the most refugees in europe , really ? 
  very well done , but this is assuming they only have 1 child . 
  and that is not the current trend among must muslims in europe i understand the point you are trying to make however , that eventually loads of people will die, 
  most migrants did just fine before hungary put up their wall though, 
  [ sweden ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/1gjdax7.gif ), 
  netherlands : sodom ? 
   you ca n't ban i.e. 
  french muslims to come to germany and reproduce . 
  lol , ofcourse not , i meant it in the sense that , everyone who is in the eu as of now , fine . 
  but lets pump the immigration brakes a little bit, 
  we do n't have to * `` deport all muslims hurr durr !, 
  '' * not a fan of that idea at all . 
  we can at least put a good 10 year ban on immigration period . 
  a society needs time to integrate the new arrivals . 
  if we keep adding and adding , the system gets overloaded , and then nobody benefits . 
  have a look at [ this ] ( http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/explorer/custom#/?subtopic=15&amp;regions=europe&amp;charttype=pie&amp;data_type=percentage&amp;year=2050&amp;religious_affiliation=all&amp;age_group=all&amp;pdfmode=false&amp;gender=all ) and tell me what you think . 
  they do n't end up with  `` exact same population figure . 
  ( lower actually , since you need a little extra just to cope with non-natural losses ) '' there is an increase from 43 million to 70 million ( and i do n't believe this takes into account immigration ), 
  so a plane or bus filled with lets say , between 30 and 80 migrants going back to where they came from . 
  roughly 1 million came into germany . 
  ca n't bothered to do the math , but i 'm guessing it would take quite a while . 
  420 light up !, 
  most parties are * saying * they would not make a coalition with him . 
   will have to go back home as soon as the situation in their home country allows it right ? 
  do you really believe this yourself ? 
  as soon as a politican says : `` maybe we should start deporting some people . '', 
  he/she will be shouted down as a racist . 
  do n't kid yourself , the people that arrived in 2015/2016 , are staying . 
  the same amount ( maybe even more ) are telling us that everything is fine and that there is nothing we should maybe talk about within our society, 
  it would be quite a big change to step away from this . 
  like the article says , 98 % of all dutch homes use gas to cook food for example . 
  this would mean we would have to import all that gas , or lay down new infrastructure , which would not be cheap . 
  i am not pushing a narrative . 
  and i can back my claims up this is what i looked at : [ source ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/23/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group/ ), 
  first i was like , [ what ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/993/875/084.png ) then i was like , i see what you did there . 
  [ it seems so ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/23/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group/ ), 
  so what 's the highest ? 
  hillary happened, 
  do you know how reproduction works ? 
  if you have 2 or 3 kids , and those kids have 2 or 3 kids ... do you see what i mean when i say `` exponentially increase '' ? 
  i am not fear mongering , i am pointing something out !, 
   unfortunately geert wilders is the only person who wants to talk about this i think this is a serious shame . 
  i could without all the bs in his political plan about banning the koran and closing mosques , that 's useless . 
  but he does have some very serious points , that no one else likes to talk about, 
   overall , the muslim population in germany has increased by roughly 1.2 million since that last study was conducted which was in 2011 ... 
  so a 1.2 million increase in 4 years . 
  while the native german population is decreasing . 
  so , lets say this number does not increase exponentially ( which it will ) that means that by 2051 , there will be 10,8 million muslims in germany . 
  ( probably even more ) and people still do n't see why some people think this might become a problem ? 
  well , who would have thought ? 
   in the daily record , khan claimed that nationalism is effectively the same as `` trying to divide us on the basis of background , race or religion '' no khan , it is not . 
  it is about wanting and doing the best for ones country . 
  this means that even a muslim of pakistani parents , living in the uk , can be a british nationalist . 
  it has nothing to do with hating someone else 's skin colour or religion . 
  unbelieveable !, 
  he 's the worst man alive !, 
  lighten up people, 
  well there you go , so it * does * depend on culture . 
  well , that was a bit of a bad trend ... 
  but we were n't the only ones !, 
  because people keep bringing up that hillary won the popular vote , like it matters even one bit . 
  as if that somehow makes trumps presidency less real . 
  deal with it, 
  oh you do n't have to explain it to me mate , i know full well why it exists . 
  most people on this sub , do n't understand it one bit, 
  i was extrapolating that the commenter would have preffered hillary, 
  * trust me , i know the eu *, 
  we were such trendsetters back then, 
  the turks are known for doing some pretty damn succesfull coups .
