i seem to have been able to avoid those places mostly . 
  except for that flirt/date/babe in almere , but i hated the place . 
  so she spent most time here with me . 
  it 's better here in rdam . 
  a transplant ... , 
  [ rotterdam ... gestolen stad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgdz0r85nie ), 
  not really odd , it still needed vertical lift shafts ... 
  as rotterdammer , i 'm not even offended . 
  it 's an acquired taste , like caviar . 
  while amsterdam wastes money like it 's rain water , in rotterdam nearly every large project has stayed within budget . 
  the new ` vertical city ' by koolhaas , the new central station , not a cent over budget . 
  it 's in the dna of this place i think , where people work rather than talk , and projects are not delayed by endless whiney complaints like in amsterdam ( rijksmuseum : `` we need a bicycle path right through it !, 
  another erasmiaans alumnus here ... , 
  not true . 
  it 's been quite full of people every single day so far since the opening . 
   you can find a lot of modern architecture in the netherlands , ** but ** most of it is really well done in my opinion . 
  you make it sound like these two naturally contradict each other ... 
  i think nsfw is kept out of ` trending ' actually . 
  * diplomat for lithuania * would have been more correct indeed . 
  honorary consuls rarely are from the represented nation . 
  `` u '' is the polite version of `` you '' in dutch . 
  in the southern dialects and flemish there 's also `` ge '' and `` gij '' but the connotation is less formal . 
  click on the subtitles tab in the lower right corner . 
  yep , that 's terrible shitspeak too ... , 
  `` act normal , that 's stupid enough already '' . 
  sums up the dutch . 
  it 's in our [ geography and culture ] ( http://www.welkoopgiessenburg.nl/images/schaatsen.jpg ) ... 
  1 . football 2 . field hockey 3 .

  in my country [ anton mussert ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anton_mussert ) can be considered the epitome of ` bad guy ' . 
  received the death penalty after ww2 . 
  ok , thank you . 
  that clarifies it a bit . 
  well , from anecdotal personal experience , i suspect these to be highly correlated . 
  eta - ok , apparently this is not so clear-cut and rather design-dependent . 
  not if it takes you double the time . 
  and then it 'll just take more time to vacuum clean your home . 
  no gain there really on its co2 footprint . 
  what a nonsense . 
  how many hours do we really use our vacuum cleaners per week ? 
  the difference will be too insignificant to justify a regulation . 
  my 2000w siemens is struggling enough to get all the cat hair off fabric . 
  they become stateless persons . 
  we 've already withdrawn passports now in 11 cases . 
  and stopped social welfare benefits to jihadists traveling to syria . 
  but this seems more difficult with university grants : there are hardly laws that allow the withdrawal of payments for study grants . 
  the only thing that 's within the regulations at the moment is turning gifts into loans ( for being late with exams ) , so that jihadists will end up with debts . 
  totally off-topic , but as photographer i hate it how they cropped out the creator 's watermark . 
  different countries , different laws . 
  where i live it 's just not permitted for anyone to wear masks or disguises in public . 
  it 's about public safety first : you should always be recognisable . 
  there 's only an exemption for carnival . 
  not wrong . 
  he can post whatever he likes . 
  but it 's just soapboxing disguised as question . 
  yep : `` this is why i 'm so hateful towards ukraine '' . 
  there 's also a weird hololympics vibe to this post . 
  yes !, 
  i doubt we 'll have to wait long before it goes around the intertubes . 
  latest reports here are that 50 flights with material have been completed between ukraine and holland by yesterday . 
  the situation on the ground has been too dangerous to fully explore the site and our investigators have been withdrawn from the scene and flown back home yesterday . 
  it 's not really clear if enough material has been collected to ever conclusively report back . 
  about half of the victims have been identified now through their dna , and most effort now goes into returning them to their families . 
  i do n't know where that idea comes from . 
  the dutch are very dedicated to unravel the truth . 
  we owe it to almost 200 of our countrymen . 
  another desperate attempt to please their crowds with ` doubt ' . 
  it 's simply been agreed conduct to not release anything prematurely . 
  let them just finish their investigations . 
  what has this got to do with europe ?? 
  yeah , i always try to be helpful too . 
  but sometimes it 's just impossible . 
  the world is not disneyland with a top attraction here and there . 
  start growing your own curiosities . 
  read books , national geographics for all i care . 
  there 'll be a moment where you think : `` i want to know more about that . 
  now that 's what i want to see for myself . '', 
  if someone really says to have no idea where they want to go , then why go away at all ? 
  be curious . 
  i hope this is satire . 
  exactly . 
  that 's where reddit is at its best . 
  personal opinions that can not be googled . 
  `` what was your favourite big city with a beach ? '', 
  `` i love butterflies , what 's the best place to see those ? '', 
  but the `` i 'm sitting at my desk , bored . 
  where shall i go ? '', 
  questions are the worst . 
  better questions on reddit can get you amazing answers . 
  but shit questions will give you shit . 
  with r/solotravel i feel almost the opposite : `` how is this about solo travel ? '', 
  it 's the same sort of advice wanted about destinations as found in r/travel . 
  i am a pure solo traveler too , and have been a subscriber for years there , but i find very few posts in that sub about that specific aspect of travel . 
  `` three days in lisbon , what to do ? '', 
  will not give you answers specifically suitable for solo travelers . 
  nothing that would help me much as solo traveler . 
  a list of museums and sights . 
  posts are usually in the same ` i 'm too lazy to do any research on my own ' attitude . 
  but that 's a reddit site-wide issue basically . 
  to be honest , who needs all that fragmentation ?
