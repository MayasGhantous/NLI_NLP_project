  i met a people smuggler in amman last year . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  they plan round-trips making visas obsolete . 
  he smuggled iraqis to amsterdam by booking tickets amman - marrakech , then marrakech to istanbul via amsterdam and istanbul back to amman . 
  the klm flight will then look like a stopover on a giant roundtrip , but in amsterdam all his clients would apply for asylum . 
  there 's no way the airliner could know this or be punished for it if there 's no schengen transit visa requirement for iraqis with layovers . 
  or if required , they would get those as ` tourists ' . 
  eta - if they were checking at the plane gate , he 'd fake a heart attack right there ...

  i thought i was discussing with you why this post lacks the quality needed as submission to a news/discussion subreddit , but seeing that you prefer the censorship circlejerk , i 'm just wasting my time here .

  it still leaves me wondering what 's happened , to whom , when , why . 
  that 's why reliable news sources are better as submissions than isolated photos from an event . 
  thank you . 
  op should submit the news source instead of a single image without context .

  i hope you 're just trolling and not really this confused about the meaning of words and rules . 
  i already did to op . 
  see thread . 
  please use reliable news sources to discuss current affairs , not vlogs and blogs with unknown journalistic standards . 
  a very simple quality requirement i 'd say . 
  did n't you already answer that question with your own quote ?
