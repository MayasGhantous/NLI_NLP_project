  please stop equating quality management with censorship , it muddies the waters . 
  we 're a big sub now , and our subscribers expect it to be about the topic it claims to be about : europe . 
  this is no different from how painters in hong kong add marks in the streets . 
  yes , it 's interesting to watch , but off-topic .

  it 's only been off the air for ten minutes or so . 
  it 's simply old news from two days ago . 
  not really upvote worthy probably to most . 
  you really need someone to explain you the difference between a highly political unsourced topic and an humor post ? 
  it makes it an unreliable source of news and information . 
  as subreddit with nearly half a million users , we deserve better than a random youtuber as starting point for discussions . 
  because there 's no way of knowing the journalistic standards of random youtube vloggers . 
  there 's too much propaganda flying around , so please use reliable quality sources when posting .

  i was convinced it was a duplicate from two days ago , but when searching i could only find a photo submission , not a report . 
  so it was re-approved . 
  looks like a mistake , should be visible again .
