  translated : onnen - in onnen was the saturday night party . 
  in the yard of nolda and jonathan tipping were the inhabitants of the local refugee center and interested people are invited to come and eat together , drink and dance . 
  `` we saw all the refugees long walk and we thought we can try to better know instead of staring ` says nolda . 
  `` we like to also let people take their own food as you experience each other 's culture better . 
  if you only drink coffee and eat biscuits then do not come to the same contacts . '', 
  a few hundred people came to this private initiative . 
  eritreans , syrians and people from onnen and environment . 
  residents found the evening a great success and are planning to hold more frequent meetings similar . 
  you can find the appropriate rail ticket links in the sidebar of r/travel .

  so many safeguards have been built into the system . 
  it 's actually bloody difficult to add or remove something from the constitution . 
  the parliament that proposes a constitutional change is not the parliament that can actually change it . 
  only after new elections have been held and new representatives have been elected , the proposed changes can be voted on . 
  it then still needs a 2/3 majority in the senate to be passed . 
  constitutions are written for the ages , not for the taste of the day . 
  i really ca n't follow . 
  if people were discussing online how your house should be burned down , you 'd not feel threatened ? 
  calling for violence is only one example of prohibited hate speech . 
  constitutions reflect a culture 's values , and should n't be changed on a whim . 
  oh , but they voted on the anti-discrimination clauses exactly in the way that could be expected of them ( and their parties ) when elected into parliament and senate . 
  this is n't controversial in any way . 
  no , that 's not how our democracy works . 
  we vote on representatives as law makers that we think best reflect our ideas . 
  yes , that 'd be more accurate . 
  while unpleasant when someone touches you in the streets , it 's of totally different order than rape . 
   lastiggevallen harrassment - calling that ` rape ' is quite a stretch ... try to stick to the facts please when commenting . 
  this looks dishonest really . 
  i ca n't find that `` two girls were raped '' claim anywhere in your sources . 
  can you link me more precisely to it ?
