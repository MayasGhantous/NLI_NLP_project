  i hope it 's a movie set ... , 
  we 're a democracy where more than 2/3 of the voters put anti-discrimination clauses into the constitution . 
  maybe as society we prefer the right to live without fear over the right to hate . 
  it does n't happen very often . 
  i think the last time it happened was with the `` monkeys ! '', 
  comments on a dutch black football player 's group photo on facebook . 
  usually the prosecution wants to give a public signal about the unacceptability of discriminatory behaviour online . 
  you never need to mop your kitchen i suppose ... 
  no , they 're considered lethal weapons and you need a permit . 
  terrorists try to conceal their shovel under their beard . 
  i live almost 10 meters below sea level , yet my feet are dry .

  why do people always compare mods to nazis ? 
  from [ this photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0zxhda2.jpg ) of our last meet-up in amsterdam it appears we 're not nearly as impopular as reddit claims . 
  yep , that 's how we came up with idea . 
  we reached 60k today . 
  we 're preparing a merger with / r/murica though , so we 'll surpass your tiny / europe sub soon enough . 
  we even gave you gold !, 
  you 've been banned from r/thenetherlands . 
  please do n't contact the mods . 
  good luck to all the new mods !, 
  and do n't burn out too soon , you 're needed !, 
   if ten thousand people would vote for `` the donald duck party '' , the same people would be just as likely to sign a petition to get it on the ballot . 
  there 's a $ 10,000 euro registration fee for new parties to get on the ballot . 
  that money is returned to the party when they win at least one seat . 
  i once ran through a morrocan airport with him and his children . 
  he 's witty as fck . 
  `` i 'll just close the airspace above rotterdam forcing us to land there so we all save time '' .
