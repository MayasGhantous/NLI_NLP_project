  there 's r/solotravel , r/backpacking , etc etc. 
  i believe in large subs with many voices , not small echo chamber subs . 
  all those posts would be welcome in the bigger sub too . 
  who would n't want to read about your less traveled destinations in r/travel ? 
  sub would only get better with that sort of input . 
  yes , if you ignore all the low-effort noise and spam , r/travel is a fun subreddit . 
  suffers from the usual legacy-modlist problems . 
  but it can be inspirational too , and people share a lot of their experiences , which is what i like best about reddit . 
  crowd-sourcing knowledge . 
  he commented to me yesterday . 
  i think there 'll be internet in most places he 'll spend the night from here . 
  no , i was asking you a simple question . 
  account was only 7 minutes old when you made that comment . 
  and while you 're at it , what do you think of eu vice-president kroes ' assessment of the hungarian press situation at the moment ? 
  you just created this account to make this comment ? 
  he 's nearly daily on r/travel . 
  if pm ` ed i 'm sure he 'll find the message soon-ish . 
  probably not . 
  that 's been covered before by the european commision . 
  [ recent blog post by commissioner kroes : media freedom under threat ... ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/blog/media-freedom-remains-under-threat-hungary ) for example . 
  eta - for easy acces since the site seems acting up : [ post by vice president kroes screenshot 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pgds7qc.jpg ) [ screenshot part 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z3p0rvf.jpg ), 
  spam . 
  source : http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2727266/sainsbury-s-strips-kosher-food-shelves-fear-attacks-anti-israeli-protesters.html, 
  they 've been members of the [ ebu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_broadcasting_union ) from the beginning . 
  if you mean qgyh2 ... then keep scribbling . 
  dude does n't mod at all in his subs . 
  unless a group specifically wants to create * terror * for the sake of terror , i 'd avoid it yes . 
  i disagree . 
  the term is just too loaded to use in reporting , unless you clearly want to express your opinion on a party . 
  just like the kremlin used the word ` terrorists ' for the maidan protesters . 
  better avoid it . 
  i remember dutch cheese having been banned once when there was n't a fence around a farm 's truck loading deck . 
  russian standards are very high ... 
  it 's not the sort of term a news source should use for insurgents . 
  yep , together with rt and all those bs conspiratard sources . 
  how else would you go into syria at the moment ? 
  everyone travels there via turkey . 
  wished they would use more neutral terms in their write-ups . 
  `` according to the terrorists ... '' is not a very unbiased description . 
  the russian people should be very happy with a consumer protection agency looking so well after them . 
  9 days ago : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2cu3xj/parliament_buildings_of_europe/, 
   it was a parody of all the x of europe posts !, 
  you did n't parody anything . 
  you asked others to do that work for you . 
  bad reddiquette then . 
  discuss your issues with those responsible for that decision first . 
  that 's the polite way of dealing with a sub 's moderators . 
  you did n't parody anything . 
  you requested others would make that parody . 
  yep , it baffles me too . 
  i 'm not coming to this sub to see everyone 's favourite naked babes . 
  on top of that : why ca n't op make that post himself if he thinks this an important part of our culture . 
  writing up this whiny post cost him more time probably . 
  some of those will be redundant with little extra gain in time when the lines are already highspeed . 
  no need for an extra amsterdam-bremen connection of course to win 30 minutes compared to amsterdam-dortmund-bremen . 
  shit 's expensive you know ... 
  you should message the mods with questions about removals . 
  not make posts about it . 
  also , your post was not discussing anything relevant to europe , it was just a request for pr0n . 
  strange . 
  i could read the full article yesterday . 
  kremlin 's plan seems obvious : deploy armour and deny it ; induce bombardment ; claim aid convoy attacked ; send in more armour ... 
  ah , another putinista shill not liking the truth . 
  yep , all of them . 
  what does siberia have to do with europe ? 
  redditor for one day ... 
  i think i remember your banned racist ass from yesterday . 
  as i said , that was a mistake . 
  sorry , mistake . 
   i do n't even know the god damn subreddit that 's why it 's in your post title . 
  man , enjoy that shithole with the racist mods and neonazi posters , if that 's what you want . 
  nah , i just commented to the bot . 
  then you neonazis came in . 
  would depend on my situation . 
  but if i needed the money , then yes , sure i would . 
  i do n't blame any of the polish friends i made for making that choice . 
  it really changed their lives and possibilities back home . 
  no , x-post references are usually used to spam a subreddit . 
  there 's no additional value in that . 
  since it 's in the fcking title , this discussion is relevant . 
  stop spamming that neonazi shithole . 
  i 'm not a mod here , so do n't make me comment on actions i did not take . 
  but it 's been a bad habit of mine to tag people in res . 
  and * every * poster there somehow seems to have a racist or neonazi tag . 
  goes to show what that sub is really attracting under the umbrella of ` free speech ' . 
  even their mods are posting racist shit . 
  because that 's what that sub is about . 
  a neonazi club-house . 
  is n't that a euphemism for not tolerating bigotry ? 
  i 'm glad the mods here do n't tolerate racism , antisemitism and hate speech really . 
  but enjoy your containment zone . 
  the more of you guys posting there , the less we get that shit here . 
  just stating the fact that all their mods were banned here . 
  not without reason probably . 
  that 's why all the neonazis that were banned here for racism and antisemitism are mod there . 
  for their ` unappreciated opinions elsewhere ' . 
  aka the neonazi clubhouse . 
  but thanks for linking bot . 
  not really back then . 
  this was before poland joined the eu .
