  now they can . 
  it was even more tragic than just salary . 
  a guy i worked with designed a whole citybus cleaning machine line . 
  then the drawings were signed by his communist party member boss as being the designer of it , with him getting all the credit for the designs , involving promotions and salary increases . 
  while this dude was still on a ten year waiting list for a flat for him and his wife and child , still living with his parents . 
  that bulb month was his glorious time in life , making ten times more money . 
  at least you 're living in the future . 
  `` i want some adventure , let 's go pick asparagus for 10 hours a day in dutch bumfuckhausen and sleep in the farm 's dorm with 20 others for a month '' . 
  very adventurous yes . 
  not about euros at all . 
  this was in the nineties . 
  but i still highly doubt that all the polish asparagus pickers and flower bulb sorters come here `` for the adventure '' . 
  it 's always been for the money . 
  it might be different now . 
  but when i went flower bulb sorting to make some money for travel , the only other people there were poles . 
  some of them engineers even . 
  but they all made more money in those one or two months in holland than during a whole year at home . 
  in my country it 's usually asparagus picking in the south ( and flower bulb sorting in the west ) . 
  it 's not so much an unwillingness to do hard labour , as it is not structural enough as source of income . 
  traditionally these fruit and vegetable picking jobs have always been done by travelers going from picking season to picking season in various countries . 
  but if you need to pay your mortgage and insurances , there 's just not much to gain from a single month 's work in the country . 
  you 'll want a real job , not a circus act . 
  next to the historic port of town . 
  still city proper . 
  not ` happens to be gay ' , it 's when the violence happens because of someone ` being gay ' . 
  it 's a hate crime targeted at a certain minority . 
  well , good thing is that if you need a new kitchen , you do n't need to go far . 
  you win  / thread . 
  it 's been dark and raining here all day . 
  stop drinking your obesitas fuel and get yourself some proper drinks . 
  my graphic designer friend is dyslexic like alphabetic dice . 
  doing all her spell checks . 
  should x-post this to / r/thenetherlands . 
  nissan already announced they would reconsider their investments if the uk would leave the eu . 
  nissan 's new model will be built in sunderland , where it employs 6,500 . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-24859486 ) but of course the uk does n't need those jobs really . 
  we 'll happily accept nissan in the eu though . 
  `` a representative of local investigation authorities made a public statement that kuashev 's body bore no traces of violence and that the authorities had no grounds to suspect that his death was the result of a crime . 
  however , rustam matsev , a local human rights lawyer who had worked closely with kuashev , told human rights watch that the forensic doctor who performed kuashev 's autopsy noted a trace of a needle prick , likely an injection , under kuashev 's arm . '',

  that 's dumb . 
  they completely miss how fragile those alliences are already these days . 
  no need for knives on the table . 
  le top lel . 
  funny how they report to the wto when they themselves go out of their way with their boycotts `` for hygienic concerns '' to avoid involvement of the wto . 
  just imagine the evening news  with us all looking up in our atlases wtf the scilly islands were ... 
   for the first time in 335 years the scillonians could sleep safety in their beds , for as the ambassador remarked ; `` it must have been awful to know we could have attacked at any moment . '', 
  hehe ... great story . 
  glad we 're friends now . 
  we 're not only the tallest men in the world , we also carry that unmentioned burden . 
  childhood memories . 
  must have seen them all with my grandmother , who was a big fan . 
  good times . 
  here in nl we mostly need penis size reduction surgery to fit in our pants . 
  wtf ? 
  on what grounds were they acquitted ? 
  so tiny tits are bigger than us ? 
  mothers and fathers , hide your children . 
  i 'd like to see it correlated to the extend of mental care coverage by the national healthcare insurances/services . 
  infrared recordings . 
  just ban image links ... done . 
  i should have screenshotted the site . 
  it was pretty good crowd-sourced evidence . 
  underneath their article they already had this ` support us ' kickstarter link , but i could n't have known they would actually pull it so soon . 
  but they provided evidence for every claim they made . 
  yeah , enjoy all your laughs in your new racist sub . 
  actually i posted one of those investigations recently : [ evidence of sam 's in rebel territory ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2bfdmg/evidence_that_russian_claims_about_the_mh17_buk/ ) but that website decided to go black and all kickstarter or something to finance future reports . 
  they showed evidence of the exact spots where the youtube footage of the buk trucks was taken , and dismissed the lies of rt and the kremlin . 
  with the help of google streetview and locals they could pinpoint the spot on the map , right in the middle of rebel territory . 
  yes , but the iragi wmd debacle gets tiresome as rebutal to every news about russian troop movements in that region . 
  it 's no longer only about satelite imagery . 
  especially when internet sleuths have proven youtube footage to be correct when pointing towards pro-russian rebel territory . 
  it looks like coming from a standard kremlin propaganda sheet . 
  find something a bit more original than that . 
  they 're just not a very good news source ? 
  is sadam 's wmd becoming the standard putinista mantra ? 
  not a human rights court . 
  [ volkskrant article ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2668/buitenland/article/detail/3703227/2014/07/28/rusland-moet-aandeelhouders-yukos-50-miljard-dollar-betalen.dhtml ) said it was the [ permanent court of arbitrage ] ( http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=363 ) : `` the pca , established by treaty in 1899 , is an intergovernmental organization providing a variety of dispute resolution services to the international community .

  that was pretty shocking to read . 
  but seeing this post : http://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/2bpd61/the_adventures_of_tin_tin_in_sweden/ by one of your fellow mods and you doing nothing about it , certainly makes you complicite . 
  at least it sets the tone for the new clubhouse when racists lead the way . 
  where did i say i feel superior ? 
  debating racists is just not something i enjoy spending my time on . 
  same with jehova witnesses because it 's all wasted effort . 
  not feeling superior to them , it just leads to nowhere . 
  nah , i 'm tired of debating neonazis and bigots on reddit . 
  have fun in your own little white clubhouse . 
   we 're not racist , but ... 
  is n't that usually how racists talk ? 
  it has been the basis for human right protections in many constitutions though . 
  taking it from there ... yes .

  well pretty much every country except saudi arabia signed the universal declaration of human rights : http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ so that makes it ` real ' enough as political reality , not always the same as real life reality of course . 
  yes , it 's not like it really worked for them  [ kazakhstan in group c. . . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ozrujvq.jpg ), 
  itt : idiotic stereotypes , negativity , bs . 
  more countries qualifying through uefa ( 53 countries for 13 berths ) than through afc ( 43 for 4 ) gave them better hopes i think for qualifying . 
  a non-issue imho . 
  does n't google chrome already give you an automated translation option ? 
  i like to see more varied sources from different countries .
