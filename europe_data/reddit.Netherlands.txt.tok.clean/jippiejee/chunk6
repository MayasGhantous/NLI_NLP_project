  i 'm slow it seems . 
  freedom ... the right to fly your car through the air . 
  cool , thank you . 
  will start reading it . 
   the leaked cables on wikileaks a couple of years ago had the american ambassador to the netherlands explain this in detail to his superiors do you happen to have a link to those ? 
  would be interested to read these . 
  like two fathers or mothers do n't have real names ... 
  what a great way to celebrate this year of dutch-russian friendship !!, 
  they were at least a lot safer that night he was taken away . 
  wished the russians would be more embarrassed about having sent such a vodka-head here to represent them . 
  a normal decent progression would have been to lift his diplomatic immunity so that a court of law cold look into the child abuse case , instead of starting this shit circus . 
  it 's sad you sympathize more with the shitfaced drunk russian father than with the children that would enjoy some immunity ( from physical abuse ) too . 
  the hague police actually has a long file about repetitive reports of child abuse . 
  go and enjoy your vodka-styled fathering . 
  but not here please . 
  dutch : language is the only country i live in . 
  english was always pretty easy compared to the other languages , apart from the causative ` have ' constructions . 
  always struggled with those . 
  `` i had him cook it '' . 
  that 's because we are all so handsome . 
  life is a very serious matter . 
  and i do n't think it 's up to germans to decide how seriously we should take the holocaust . 
  if applied to any other company than a big fascist war profiteer , yes . 
  if the concept is used for daimler-benz , no . 
  disgusting and tasteless really . 
  yes , but it 's still a very poor and insensitive choice by those students . 
  a little inappropriate maybe to associate that company , that avidly supported nazism and in return received arms contracts and tax breaks to grow by a whopping 830 % during the fascist rise , now with anti-nazism ? 
  ** netherlands ** a new party is required to register in all 19 voting districts and needs 30 signatures from citizens in those districts : 570 supporters in total . 
  candidate signatures are allowed as long as in their own voting district . 
  on top of that a $ 12000 euro registration fee needs to be paid as deposit , which will be paid back if 75 % of the necessary votes for a seat has been achieved . 
  it serves as a security against a flood of nonsense parties . 
  so why not wei\u00dfru\u00dfland then ? 
  what 's the rule about \u00df 's ? 
  * wit-rusland * in dutch as well . 
  it 's great to have you with us . 
  cheers . 
  no more wars . 
  yeah baby ... , 
  i 'm fcking drunk like a swede already ... < 3 anouk !, 
  yay netherlands ... 
  how 's that undemocratic ? 
  he went to parliament and senate ( a joined session ) today and asked for approval . 
  four members out of 225 decided to stay away ( let 's assume they were the nay sayers ) , all the others gave him their support . 
  brilliant . 
  thanks for posting . 
  duty hike on booze and tobacco by a large margin ... :( ( nl ), 
  it gives a sense of community and security in neighborhoods when its inhabitants are not anonymous . 
  there were two admins involved in the conversation , and they both basically repeated and restated that they have no way to verify that this girl is actually sick , nor that this family does want to receive all those postcards . 
  they consider it doxx and therefore a shadowbannable offence . 
  our modmail in / r/thenetherlands with admin screenshots as proof . 
  it means the admins cancel your account and you 're no longer visible on reddit , without you knowing it . 
  posting personal information like people 's addresses breaks one of reddit 's prime rules . 
   so feel free to share it here no , users have been shadowbanned by the admins over that yesterday . 
  and latin for ` the good light '' ...

  that 's pretty standard on reddit , only 1 % or so actively participates on the site , most visitors only lurk . 
  it means half of those who are active filled out the survey . 
  coffee of course !, 
  please check the sidebar wiki links of r/travel , it 's all there . 
  the same newspaper actually just posted a column saying the same thing : this is territory for social workers , not the police .

  that 's how you troll the trolls . 
  +1 for russia . 
  why not try the swedish subreddit for such a local question ? 
  / r/sweden, 
  please try / r/whereisthis for questions like this . 
  now , that 's a train i 'd like to be on  fun alternative to the trans-siberian rail route . 
  the inner workings of reddit 's spamfilter are a mystery to mods . 
  nobody knows . 
  please use / r/europemeta for meta discussions . 
  but your posts have not been deleted , they were in the spamfilter . 
  people speak english in the tourist circles you 'll hang out in . 
  oh op never stated it had to be a national . 
  in that case my vote goes to mussert too . 
  [ seyss-inquart maybe ?

  please be reminded this is r/europe : answers should relate to european countries to be on-topic . 
  try / r/samplesize instead if you want to poll reddit . 
  we 're not a free survey focus group , thnx . 
  upvoted for title . 
  this has already been posted an hour ago . 
  removed !, 
  yes you 'll be fine . 
  embarassingly shitty english , some worse german and french . 
  please try / r/iwantout for this , they 're much more experienced with these kind of issues . 
  most hostels are  18 and older only , and i think the same counts for workaway programs . 
  this question is better suited for / r/travel maybe where more people hang out who 've done this before . 
   the circle diameter to gdp is accurate though . 
  do n't you think that highly misleading in a graph ?

  spot on . 
  newspapers have never printed * every * letter to the editor . 
  editors selecting what 's valuable , and what 's not , is not censorship .
