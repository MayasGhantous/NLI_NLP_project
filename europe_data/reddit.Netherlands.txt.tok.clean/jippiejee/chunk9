  they 're all citing the bbc as source , who make no such claim . 
  there are hundreds of people on the greek ferries . 
  tourists too . 
  turks and greeks too . 
  `` identified as refugee '' in your title ? 
  that 's highly misleading . 
  well , that 's just an rt assumption . 
  the actual source of their story ( bbc ) never stated that . 
  more people take trains , ferries and buses in europe , without posing as refugee . 
  he simply travelled the same route . 
  yep , and the bbc never claimed they were posing as refugees , only that they were on the same ferry , like so many other travellers who were also not refugees . 
  yes , that source never states he did so as refugee . 
  he simply travelled back to europe through greece , which is quite a normal route for europeans really .
