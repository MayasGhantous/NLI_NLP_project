  did n't poland take some land from czechoslovakia as well in 1938 ? 
  this is standard for politicians in many countries . 
  i agree it 's ridiculous but it 's not just an eu thing . 
   the size of the hole in the center of the disc is the size of the dutch 10 ( guilder - ) cent coin . 
  and the size of the outside was determined so that one of beethoven 's symphonies would fit on the memory , per request by one of the bosses at sony, 
  impressive that they found a way to make ede even more of a shithole than it was already, 
  wtf are you on about, 
  maybe do one post with all of them rather than posting each country individually ? 
  to be fair the party for the animals says it represents all animals _ including _ humans,

  literally just some lines and words on a piece of white . 
  no labeled axes , no title , no explanation at all . 
  i know what pca is , but what are the data points themselves ? 
  how do i read this plot ? 
  hahaha, 
  we remember the big events from the past , not the day-to-day drivel . 
  in 30 years , we will remember the big events happening now , not the reality tv . 
  he died of cardiac failure so i doubt they will give his heart to someone, 
  to be fair there is still a lot of room for improvement if people like amri can somehow slip through despite being flagged several times . 
   you and your people have brought a blight of terror onto all of europe  some shame and a few apologies for the terror attacks you have caused generalisations and blaming civilians is sure to help promote your cause !, 
  you 've linked a wikipedia article with the image opened , rather than the image itself . 
  i suggest deleting this and re-submitting with only the image url : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/1644_europa_recens_blaeu.jpg, 
  4th and 5th paragraphs in the article . 
  what is the point of paying for intelligence , which clearly works if these people are apparently noticed beforehand , and then not acting on it ? 
  excellent descriptive title, 
  where exactly is `` out of the country '' ? 
  you can hardly just dump them in your neighbour country, 
   brejmen yep , sounds 100 % dutch, 
  we would have gotten away with it too , if it were n't for those meddling anglophones,

  there is a lot of overlap between the two now, 
   typical european no such thing, 
  european number plates are functional , which is all a number plate should be, 
   [ 5 ] vvd , pvv , sp , gl , fvd | 83 seats this would be fun, 
   there were plans to drain the lake and build another polder there .

  the other comment shows how little dutch people generally know and care about nassau :p, 
  i think you mean by the grace of god , king of the netherlands , prince of orange-nassau , jonkheer van amsberg , marquis of veere and flushing , count of katzenelnbogen , vianden , diez , spiegelberg , buren , leerdam and culemborg , burgrave of antwerp , baron of breda , diest , beilstein , the town of grave and the lands of cuyk , ijsselstein , cranendonk , eindhoven , liesveld , herstal , warneton , arlay and nozeroy , hereditary and free lord of ameland , lord of borculo , bredevoort , lichtenvoorde , het loo , geertruidenberg , clundert , zevenbergen , hooge and lage zwaluwe , naaldwijk , polanen , st maartensdijk , soest , baarn , ter eem , willemstad , steenbergen , montfort , st vith , b\u00fctgenbach , dasburg , niervaart , turnhout and besan\u00e7on, 
  i really do n't see fvd and denk both pulling 2 tbh, 
  note that `` irish '' usually refers to `` irish gaelic '' . 
  there is also a [ scottish gaelic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_gaelic ) language , which is not the same as [ scots . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scots_language ), 
  well that 's a late reply, 
  rita was not as extreme then as wilders is now , and she did not have a lot of support from the vvd leadership ( although the referendum in 2006 between her and rutte was quite tight ) . 
  i do not think the vvd leadership would allow the party to become what the pvv is now . 
  and without screaming populism , i do not see wilders becoming very popular . 
  wilders would never have been more than a fringe member of the vvd . 
  he would not have been able to launch his current platform under the vvd banner and thus would not have been able to make use of the populist strategy . 
  i do n't think his leaving the vvd is proof that he actually believes what he says . 
  i would be surprised if the vvd is willing to work with the pvv again considering how wilders dropped them previously, 
  i doubt it , americans are famed for their sense of humour and understanding of sarcasm, 
  huh , i never realised he wrote gijsbrecht van aemstel . 
  he does n't , he let one of the governments fall just to purge his own party members [ ( source ) ] ( http://www.nu.nl/boek/2945779/wilders-stapte-kabinet-brinkman.html ), 
  probably * ' t kofschip * , the rule for how to write down the perfect form of a verb . 
  `` i have played '' -  `` ik heb gespeel ** d ** '' `` i have biked '' -  `` ik heb gefiets ** t ** '' whether you use a d or a t depends on whether the third last letter of the infinitive ( all regular verbs end in - en so it 's the letter before that ) is one of the consontants in the phrase * ' t kofschip * or not . 
   sweden is n't some islamic rape-paradise with sharia laws . 
  shakira * laws, 
  why not uzbek ?
