how about this one http://i.imgur.com/uc4zhmo.jpg, 
  do you like burek with cheese or burek with meat ? 
  yep , i use my dutch one . 
  nothing odd about that, 
  the ring ? 
  as mildly colorblind that graph is annoying . 
  especially because they chose gradients instead of flat colors, 
  guy in your pic is a kakket . 
  i do n't like them eithet, 
  funny how i associate indian food with chicken . 
  i love brazil 's passport for interplanitary travel . 
  switzerland 's clean design is just downright delicious and vatican city 's is so classy . 
  why did you explain it to me while the american got downvotes ? 
  nah , ( old ) dutch houses have big windows because of calvinism . 
  you could look in , because everyone was modest and had nothing to hide . 
  there 's a saying here : act normal , that 's already crazy enough . 
  i 'm bosnian and i noticed in general we ( i also know croats and serbs here ) tend to show off more , and value clothes which look fancy . 
  i sometimes go out in my shitty baggy yoga ants to the store and some family members find it silly . 
  they would n't dare . 
  me neither, 
  but none of them have somon and pogaca !, 
  development in yugoslavian countries kept going between 1945-1990 though . 
  slovenia ( or croatia ) need not be mentioned in this thread . 
  their situation was different . 
  hmm ? 
  the balkans have the best reputation . 
  number one best integrated former refugees in netherlands , germany and austria . 
  look it up . 
  there was a similar fear back in the 90s that the sudden influx of ex-yu people but it turned out good . 
  but no one really is fleeing from the balkans these days . 
  there 's no war . 
  just a handful of fortuneseekers but they get sent back right away . 
  one of the most annoying things in life is when you want to quickly pay your groceries but there 's an old person in front of you paying with cash . 
  what 's even worse is if the cashier asks if the old person collects airmiles or some other crap . 
  than not only do you have to wait for the change to be given back , but also that collectible crap . 
  our biggest chain , albert heijn , always has that stuff . 
  oh and for discount you need to give them a discount card to scan , and old people generally do n't give that right away , also adding to my wait time . 
  rant over , sorry . 
  yep . 
  last time i purposefully took cash from the atm to pay for stuff has been years ago . 
  one way to fight that behavior is to stop making jokes like this . 
  i 'm sure they 're tired of it, 
  girls say that utrecht has lots of attractive men . 
  coincidentally , the female/male ratio is the biggest in utrecht . 
  in delft it 's the lowest . 
  personally i like colorful clothes on girls who are into something creative . 
  so i tend to think voorstraat and between janskerkhof and neude with the studenty and hipsterish cafes has pretty people . 
  but in general i tend to prefer bigger cities like utrecht and amsterdam , any city where there 's a creative or just an indie or alternative scene . 
  here where i live ( rhenen , with nearby veenendaal ) is the opposite . 
  sure , the girls here have pretty bodies but their mentality and demeanor ( like most people here ) is unnactractive to me . 
  small town syndrome and all that . 
  i 'm asking again , what is wrong with her * policies * ? 
  those sound like good initiatives . 
  what is wrong that message ? 
  the policies she can set are probably sound . 
  i 'm bosnian but i grew up here in the netherlands . 
  i live in the utrecht province . 
  i grew up in rhenen on the south-east edge of the province but generally spend my time ( and sometimes live in ) the city of utrecht . 
  have n't watched tv in 12 years . 
  ever since torrents became a thing, 
  my flair is dutch cause i lived here all my life , but ethnically i am bosnian, 
  i am very familiar with our rakija . 
  how does it compare to moonshine ? 
  i do n't get triggered by national things, 
  use trains would be my biggest recommendation . 
  cute coastal quaintness i do n't really associate with our coasts really . 
  my proposed city trip : luxembourg city - liege - maastricht - valkenburg - den bosch - utrecht - amsterdam, 
  you can be fancy and say it 's due to the legacy of coffee culture from vienna and the ottoman empire influencing the balkans . 
  i disagree . 
  it 's basically `` how much time do people spend at doing x in your country ? '', 
  my family is the same , and still go together on vacation in towns with little cultural or historic value , just beaches and bars . 
  a couple of my cousins love it and still go with them as well . 
  just lay on the beach for a week and go the bar at night . 
  they do n't understand why i do n't want to go with them . 
  it used to be tucepi , then makarska , both towns in croatia . 
  meanwhile , historic split and dubrovnik are mere hours away and no one ever wanted to go there . 
  last year i took my revenge and did a solo trip , visiting 8 coastal cities in 2 weeks . 
  i find it odd that you do n't understand . 
  i thought eastern and southern europe were a bit similar . 
  in ex-yugoslavian countries ` how are you ' is also a greeting just like in the uk or us . 
  you just say ` fine , how are you ' or elaborate a bit and start the conversation . 
  the percentage of people incarcerated in the us is way bigger than for europe . 
  try south america , or perhaps south africa . 
  but i understand you want to know about europe . 
  okay , so i was lazy and did n't open every crevice to fill with liquid ( melted ) butter . 
  instead i dipped the potatoes in the pan with the butter and put them on an oven plate afterwards . 
  probably wo n't reach inside the crevices , oh well . 
  edit : the butter reached the crevices reasonably well . 
  it helped that i had really small potatoes . 
  so the crispy outside and soft inside felt kind of like a potato croquette . 
  i added cumin , paprika powder , pepper , vegeta and chives to my butter . 
  i knew the chives would burn but they surprisingly tasted good . 
  next time i 'll separate the chives and butter-spice mixture through a sieve and add them on the potatoes afterwards . 
  i also did n't bother with cheese , somehow i forgot . 
  i put them in the oven , wanted to grab grated cheese from the fridge but somehow something else came up and i promptly forgot about it . 
  anyway , here 's a photo : http://i.imgur.com/7jb5ops.jpg, 
  i am no aficiniado , so i would n't know what the difference is between the two . 
  here 's a list of links of all the american ones i could find on the website of the biggest dutch supermarket : https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi234377/brooklyn-brewery-lager https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi398865/anderson-valley-holy-gose https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi231279/anchor-go-west-ipa https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi385779/kona-castaway-ipa https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi234382/flying-dog-raging-bitch https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi398871/boulevard-calling-ipa https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi385795/boulevard-tank-7-farmhouse-ale https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi407347/spencer-india-pale-ale https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi398863/anderson-valley-hop-ottin-ipa-india-pale-ale https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi398916/sierra-nevada-pale-ale https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi398917/sierra-nevada-torpedo-extra-ipa all of them quite strong , because they 're ipas . 
  i 'd be curious trying a normal one . 
  yeah they are similar .
