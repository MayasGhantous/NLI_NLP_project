  our kebab plates do n't include cheese so i guess that 's why we have the kapsalon . 
  that bread looks interesting , what is it ? 
  the doner box is also available in the netherlands . 
  though we also have our own specialty called [ kapsalon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kapsalon ) . 
  http://www.bosschebasakdoner.nl/images/b2.jpg ( fries , kebab , melted cheese , garlic and sambal sauce , salad ), 
  we have foreign craft beers nowadays in the netherlands . 
  from the us and new zealand and probably from canada as well . 
  our dutch supermarkets now stock a few american microbrewery beers . 
  they 're quite good , but usually too strong . 
  try some . 
  hmm yeah you got a point . 
  the melted cheese counteracts the crispyness of the butter . 
  i 'll try and make a few tonight , in various options . 
  in bosnia we would put cream on it as well , and perhaps more butter than you guys would , but not as much as in your example . 
  still , the example could be nice if everything was done in smaller amounts , and only one type of cheese used . 
  i would put a pea-sized amount of butter in every cut , sprinkled with vegeta and pepper and then in the oven . 
  and sour cream at the end . 
  anything involving surstr\u00f6mming is the worst example of a thing you can do with surstr\u00f6mming, 
  the french people i meet at parties or festivals i strike up a conversation with just fine . . ? 
  all those rappers suck . 
  stick to the indie scene i would say . 
  qn5 , rhymesayers and doomtree , stuff like that . 
  you 're generalizing . 
  generalizing is bad , so if you know you are doing it , why do you keep on doing it ? 
  you , you , you i 'm sure you happen to be talking to the quintessential american , who happens to be every thing you see in the media, 
  my school has a lectorship called co-design . 
  i think that 's the buzz word you should be looking for . 
  we got neum !!!!!!!, 
  yeah , it 's annoying . 
  people like to stereotype and be dicks for no reason . 
  i almost never smoke weed or hash but if i happen to buy a joint at a coffeeshop , i just pay with my debit card like i do everywhere else . 
  when talking about illegal drugs and paying without cash is fine , i transfer the money with a banking app . 
  as a joke sometimes i thank them for the drinks last night . 
  it helps that the people i buy from are usually friends . 
  radio kootwijk in the netherlands is pretty remote . 
  it 's a village in the middle of the nature park veluwe . 
  there 's a building there which housed radio equipment which was used to contact indonesia ( former colony ) . 
  the remoteness was ideal due to lack of interference for radio signals . 
  technically suho meso is not ` raw ' per se . 
  try the dutch ` filet americain ' http://i.imgur.com/cp7gag0.jpg, 
  what 's with the gangsta hiphop in this thread ? 
  funny how all the european rappers posted here happen to dress and behave like they came from the same inner city neighborhoods like their american counterparts . 
  i thought op wanted good rap in this thread . . 
  i mostly dislike gangsta-rap and generally stay away from commercial hip-hop which is musically uninspired or not innovative , or with uninspired lyrics . 
  ________ i live in the netherlands , there 's some good instrumental hiphop producers but i will refrain from posting them since you specifally asked for rap . 
  so here are artists who rap : * [ pete philly & perquisite ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3outxj4ll7u ) were really good . 
  pete philly rapped about life and love , while classically trained perquisite made beats infused with classical instruments . 
  * i think the guys from [ dope d.o.d. 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-zl_padvtc ) share my opinion about the state of dutch hip-hop , and thus have emerged on the scene as a an opposing voice with a dirty and dark sound i welcome very much . 
  _____ i 'm originally from bosnia . 
  there 's plenty of rap across the ex-yugoslavian countries but too much angrily rapped lyrics over beats i consider mediocore . 
  * i do n't know anything about bosnian-based [ helem nejse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncawp8mv7vk ) , but the beat is made by billain , an accomplished dnb-producer . 
  * from croatia i really enjoy [ djecaci ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uggrwrov0mg ) . 
  their beats are so diverse , sometimes changing completely within one song . 
  suitable for things other than hip-hop as well . 
  the lyrics are quite funny and witty if you take the time to translate them . 
  i also appreciate that their raps flow much smoother than most slavic-language rap . 
  less syllables and harsh sounds than usual . 
  * also from croatia , [ tbf \\ ( the beat fleet \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtr0e-vghuo ) . 
  i do n't know them all that much but they 're not as electronically oriented if i had to guess . 
  a third league is like 3rd class . 
  ( i know nothing of sports ), 
  ask the band [ the cyclist conspiracy . 
  ] ( https://thecyclistconspiracy-trashmouth.bandcamp.com/track/the-great-staurocycle ) they 're pretty experienced . 
  why is ** third ** in bold ? 
  i 've had good experiences at meneer smakers in utrecht and byron in newcastle . 
  g0od meat , good bread . 
  i 've never seen mall culture in the netherlands . 
  i mean , we have them , but it 's not part of a lifestyle . 
  i 'd rather have tex mex than bland dutch mex, 
  the meat is fresh and very tasty, 
  . . it 's a joke, 
  way to make it awkward !, 
  i love you . 
  nope , difference between the two as seen from the point of view of an outsider to both countries !, 
  the reason i started this thread is because there was one about the experience europeans have in the us when it comes to infrastructure , service and amenities . 
  i wonder how things go in canada so i wanted to look up first-hand experiences of europeans who 've been to both , to read about the differences . 
  thanks for writing it up . 
  i can infer the differences and similarities from your post , but my question is more aimed at people who 've been to * both * countries , who can personally point out the differences , big and small . 
  bosnian here . 
  i harbor no ill will to anyone . 
  i have friends and am a fan of musical artists across most of ex-yu . 
  tientje could be translated as tenner, 
  i just read the wiki and plans changed ; it 's going to be used . 
  how 's about storing it ? 
  or selling ? 
  or training new people to field it ? 
  you should google belgrade on the water, 
  where did the extra student come from ? 
  why ? 
  can you draw the layout ? 
  i wonder how the situation demands it, 
  bosnian here . 
  i notice bosnian serbs are different than serbian serbs in their demeanor . 
  i wonder how serbs from serbia view them . 
  not that i 'm an authority , i grew up in the netherlands . 
  in my circle the bosnian serbs and bosnian croats are way more similar to the bosnians than they are to serbs . 
  likewise the bosnian croats i know are different than croatians i encounter in croatia proper . 
  i agree with you , 
  for the future people,
