  bosnia . 
  live in the netherlands . 
  born in 1989 , came to the netherlands in 1993 . 
  now it 's 2017 . 
  bosnian here . 
  i 'm not really familiar with folk music . 
  and i try to separate it from the pop folk and especially turbo folk . 
  i despise those two , and because of that i never really bothered to look into the main folk genre as a whole . 
  though i am quite familiar with rock and new wave from the area . 
  but there 's plenty of contemporary artists whose musical basis is some kind of folk music , but with modern elements . 
  _____ [ mostar sevdah reunion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ievueusdrzi ) , sevdah/gypsy/folk . 
  sevdah is traditional bosnian folk music . 
  _____ [ bozo vreco ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgn7gucmfp4 ) , he sings sevdah sometimes acapella , but usually in a band with a jazzy feel , and he collaborated with a drum 'n bass artist and a triphop band . 
  best thing is he 's a queer man full with religious tattoos of multiple religions playing traditional music in the southern balkans , who are not known for their supportive stance on homosexuality . 
  _____ [ divanhana ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltenfasenrm ) , folk with a poppy jazzy feel . 
  _____ [ velahavle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfcmjgwhuag ) , feat . 
  this is the aforementioned trip-hop band . 
  the band is bosnian , the singer bulgarian . 
  so i guess the folk element here is bulgarian . 
  _____ shoutout to goran bregovic , a croatian/serbian guy born in sarajevo , bosnia . 
  not sure what you should call him , but it does n't matter in this thread , his music encompasses so many elements . 
  i 'd say gypsy comes closest . 
  he was the main creative force behind the bosnian rock band [ bijelo dugme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qhd7ukrety ) and his contemporary solo work is more gypsy/serbian / [ greek ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68670tqwo6c ) oriented . 
  netherlands here . 
  i saw a pop-up store in utrecht . 
  empty , with 3 tables right after the entrance with a skinny legged hipster behind him selling the stuff . 
  behind the store along the canal there 's the occasional stall which sells clothes , belts and shoes . 
  and now also fidget spinners . 
  i walk around there every morning before the stalls are set up and i saw lots ripped open fidget spinner packages on the ground from the day before . 
  the craze is apparently so big people do n't throw the packaging in the bin !, 
  did n't know gods give out healthcare and education . 
  what 's a jute ? 
  but yugoslavia was n't aligned with the soviet union, 
  trieste kind of works, 
  rijeka has a good mix of architecture in the city center . 
  i adore it . 
  i like boston for its european style streets, 
  nothing really . 
  i do n't ever start but if someone else does i do n't mind . 
  no it is not , they 're good pizzas . 
  i always put ketchup on half of my slices . 
  i like it the regular way , and a few slices with cold ketchup . 
  same reason i dip sausages or whatever in condiments . 
  i like the meat taste as is , but i also like to dip it in a condiment . 
  just try it . 
  dutch , iranian , german , and me , bosnian, 
  what you linked there , i would n't want to put ketchup on . 
  it 's not a substitute , i never said that . 
  you add it when the pizza is served . 
  the pizza and tomato sauce and the toppings are hot , the ketchup is cold . 
  try it . . 
  so what about stuff in konzum ? 
  the cold sweet ketchup goes well with the warm tomato sauce . 
  i put ketchup on pizza . 
  in the balkans when you get pizza served , you get a tray of ketchup to pour it over . 
  do n't knock it til you try it . 
  london for the lively music scene and the sheer amount of things to see and do . 
  i love architecture 2 . 
  barcelona , similar things , but for the weather too 3 . 
  utrecht , my social life is concentrated there and i used to live there as a student . 
  need to go back soon maybe hmm hmm, 
  die = that, 
  i 've actually bought american style a few weeks back in a spar , hoping it was the sweet american variety . 
  turns out it was the same as calve , but with way more peanuts . 
  best crunchy goodness i 've had with peanut butter so far !, 
  that too !, 
  have fun visiting all the villages of the world . 
  - euro - schengen - drive on the right side - abiding by all the rules like every other state - clean up corruption and solve problems in the lower layers of society , like the large amount of homeless and homeless guestworkers, 
  big cities have multiple hot spots , especially ` newer ' ones . 
  i think for la sunset boulevard ( the iconic palm tree lined street ) , hollywood boulevard ( the walk of fame ) , rodeo drive ( shops ) and venice beach ( beach ) are such places . 
  but looking at them in google maps , it all seems so sparse aside from venice beach . 
  it 's not as cozy or tight as i 'm familiar with in europe . 
  but a city like san francisco , new york or boston i believe do have those qualities more . 
  where do you live ? 
  go to belgium from the netherlands , both having the same climate and you 'll notice it instantly . 
  good, 
  have n't owned one for almost 15 years . 
  when i lived as a student for 2 years , i had the old hdtv of my parents but only used it for videogames or to hook up the laptop to watch movies and shows . 
  i see automatic more and more in the netherlands . 
  it has almost become the new norm . 
   it would just sound pedantic to assume people speak english . 
  i disagree . 
  it 's a fair assumption , and it happens to be true in countries other than france , wallonia or italy . 
  plenty . 
  i 'm bosnian living in the netherlands , and aside from these languages and english , i also listen to afrikaans , jamaican patois , turkish , italian , german , french , spanish , portuguese , icelandic , swedish , russian , greek , arabic , thai , indian , and japanese . 
  on the regular . 
  not sure if the touareg have their own language , but i guess it 's either berber or arabic . 
  cevapcici in the coastal cities are just not as good . 
  though i have seen a shop with `` original sarajevo cevapcici '' in split . 
  have n't tasted it though . 
  please keep qi , big fat quiz , 8 out of 10 cats , taskmaster and so on . 
  real one meaning the hallucination causing one ? 
  that was because of the high levels of copper in the water which was used . 
  as in , the production process used to be unsanitary . 
  just send in kontrust with their videoclip of bomba . 
  standing ovulation . 
  yeah but seriously , they 're everywhere . 
  it 's so blatant, 
  judging from the influx of new ` beggars ' i see in utrecht , maybe it 'll be a thing in a few years . 
  here on reddit i write in us english .
