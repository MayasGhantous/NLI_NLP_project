  it 's one of many things , it 's not more influential than the other ones . 
  i recognize that so i know not to place too much importance in it . 
  and you know what happens when people or politicians do that . .  it 's not wrong to be proud of who you are , so as long as you do n't corrupt it into nationalism certainly . 
  but it 's also not wrong to not place importance on that . 
  like this melania trump , or at least your perception of her . 
  personally i do n't see the need for it . 
  truthfully i think people who sometimes do n't look at the broader picture but only within their own culture so may not get exposed to other ideas . 
  i value being exposed to other ideas so i can look at myself from a distance and learn something new about myself . 
  so , you know , the fact that you were a tad bit condescending about melania based on that piece of info ( she not talking in slovenian ) left me with a bad taste in my mouth . 
  whether or not she 's a shitty person is not really dependent on the fact of whether or not she talks in slovenian , be it in public or not . 
  who knows , maybe she does but outside of the public eye . 
  like i said , in my view , it 's one of soooo many things comprising a person and his or her identity , and it 's not good or bad if one does n't partake in it . 
  certainly it should n't you grant you to judge her poorly because of that tiny little thing . 
  apparenly 500px is not from the us , but from canada , so there 's that . 
  what 's also interesting that flickr too was developed by a canadian company . 
  nowadays yahoo owns them and they \u00e1re american . 
  yesterday i made potatoes + red paprika + onions + chicken filet in a red curry sauce . 
   never heard her speak slovenian . 
  i think that tells you enough about her heritage and her pride of it . 
  it tells maybe something about the amount of things you 've seen her in and how you base your opinions . 
  and also your perception on the importance of things . 
  chill the fuck out , if she really does n't speak much about it then that does n't mean she is not proud or something . 
  and even not , why is that important ? 
  why should a person feel ` proud ' about something his or her ancestors did while he or she did n't take part in it . 
  [ george carlin says it better . 
  probably because the country as a whole is poorer ? 
  there are more well off people here so they wo n't bother with doing porn . 
  the ones that do are the ones too lazy/stupid/drugged up to get even benefits . 
  so that 's why our porn is full of crack skanks and theirs feature normal beautiful girls . 
  where do you live ? 
  i 've seen the larger packs in london and in around newcastle . 
  could be , yes . 
   i 'm afraid that i 'm based in the uk and i 've never seen 200g packs those are the small ones , we have those as well . 
  but i 've seen bigger ones . 
  a quick look at the tesco and sainsbury 's website confirms there are 150g packs . 
  just not 200g , which is odd . 
  but really , every country i 've been to has big packs , not just the small snack-sized ones . 
   ` everyone ' buys 25g or 34g packs as they are the practical size for one serving for one person . 
  really , so you 've never eaten a big pack ( or can ) by yourself ? 
  it 's a thing people here do sometimes , a guilty pleasure , working their way through a 200g pack of chips . 
  i 'm sure it 's the same in the uk . 
   i note that your lays in the netherlands are in 225g packs not 200g . 
  yeah that 's new . 
  the normal sized ones are 200g but lately there have been unconventional sizes . 
  would n't it be easier to just ask everyone how much a 200g package costs ? 
  it 's the normal size everyone usually buys and is familiar with , it 's the practical ` scale ' , so to speak . 
  not that euro per kg stuff . 
  no one buys chips in bulk so as to think in terms of euros per kg . 
  anyway , here are the prices from a big supermarket chain in the netherlands : http://i.imgur.com/nbulcpl.png, 
  every american student or fellow tourist i 've met were a delight socially . 
  the openness of the people . 
  i thought he meant how you can use it as a verb . 
  the personal experiences i 've had here in the netherlands were good . 
  in our old flat a syrian family of 4 from damascus moved in and i met them when i came to get our mail . 
  the mother was a php-developer and the father sold houses , from what i could gather from his description . 
  i 've been there a few times and always got offered juice , candy or fruit . 
  they also asked me to stay over for spaghetti but i already had plans . 
  at my previous job in a magazine we had one refugee syrian as far as i know . 
  he was 17 when i was still there and he worked really hard . 
  nice guy too . 
  reminded me of young polish summer workers we get every year . 
  for a few days i also worked as a cameraman at a small family-oriented camping festival , where they invited lots of refugees from the local center to participate . 
  they received tents and they mingled a bit with the locals . 
  the kids understandably easily but the parents kept more to themselves . 
  i did get nice homemade kebab from them during bbq-hour . 
  -- i 've also read last year about a classical music concert they held here . 
  they invited musicians and student musicians from the refugee center and together they composed something and some time later performed it for a huge crowd . 
  -- as for negative things ? 
  i do n't know . 
  what dominated the discourse here was mostly the gypsies immigrating from other parts of europe and scamming people on the streets , inter-turkish tensions and fights because of the erdogan-gulen rivalry and turkish and moroccan shithead vloggers who wreck shit and fight people in their youtube vids . 
  then other turks or moroccans stepped up and put them in their place . 
  not that they listened though . 
  whenever syrians or other refugees came in the news it was in a positive light , sometimes when they were victimized .

  uk inter-city trains are expensive though . 
  sweet . 
  next time i visit any other country than the uk , i 'll just buy an uk sim card . 
  yeah but you live in london . 
  i 'm sure certain neighborhoods in american cities are the same . 
  well , the uk is closer to iceland than austria is . 
   why `` w\u00fcrdest '' and not `` m\u00f6chtest '' ? 
  or does both make sense ? 
  second is better translated as `` want '', 
  i 'm sure he 's asking whether or not you 'd visit them and why . 
  they do n't have a sign with their name on it ? 
  bosnian here . 
  my mother makes it herself by mixing cream ( the watery tasteless one ) and creme fraiche together . 
  cheese souffle . 
  not that unique , 
  * with margarine, 
  schuddebuikjes are just small pepernoten . 
  i 've had both in a bowl of milk . 
  still waiting on bosnia, 
  ah , yes , moving the position . 
  you can see the steering wheel in those cars ? 
  not sure , but everything was written in english . 
  never encountered this . 
  they still sound proper in my circles . 
  i 've had a good normal tasting budweiser in croatia .
