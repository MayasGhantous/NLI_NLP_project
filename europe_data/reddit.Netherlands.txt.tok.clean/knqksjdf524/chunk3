  yes , we 're very [ densly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/area_and_population_of_european_countries#countries_and_dependencies ) population . 
  holland ( the provinces ) and flanders ( northern belgium ) perhaps even reach 500 people/km2 . 
  they take up a defensive role whilst russia is on the offensive . 
  the nordic council ( 26 million people ) and the benelux ( 28 million people ) should cooperate more , we 're very similar . 
  because people want to be treated differently in the eu . 
  we 've different views on social security , some prefer it to stay limited whilst others love to spend money on it . 
  you will never get all 28 members to agree on such a vital subject . 
   astana it looks horrible !, 
  golden towers , seriously ? 
  another city , just like in the gulf , without a soul build with oil money . 
   austria has 10 governments still different than belgium 's situation . 
  local governments in belgium have more power than the federal government financially , when excluding social security . 
   all nations should just replace each top government with the eu-parliament , that 's enough saving and great individual democracy for each region . 
  so , social security will get managed by the eu ? 
  bravo romania , bravo !, 
  ugh , can he not be more like van rompuy ? 
  it would just be like belgium institutionally , but on a larger scale . 
  they 've 6 governments for 11.5 million people . 
  it 's probably nothing significant knowing that two of its members are at war . 
  [ benelux for the win !,

  til switzerland has turkish immigrants . 
  i never knew they 'd allow poorer immigrants from non eu-states in . 
  / r/conspiracy might be able to help you with that . 
  how does he make the uk interesting ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that the belgians have important scientist as well , perhaps not as important as darwin but still . 
  just accept that apart from london , the uk is boring as hell . 
  you 're also getting more and more irrelevant by the day . 
  what 's interesting about the uk ? 
  apart from having a rather large population by eu standards , what else do you guys have going along ? 
  the only non-boring countries in the eu are france , italy and spain if you ask me . 
   the poor chaps are running out of interesting things to put on their money , obviously . 
  ever looked at your own currency ? 
  news flash : the queen is n't an interesting person , nor is a bridge , a coat of arms or a tree an interesting object  . 
  edit : butthurt brits downvoting me , hilarious !, 
  that is if the chinese are really going to invest in this . 
  wishful thinking . 
  do n't get your hopes up . 
  you 're dealing with the chinese here . 
  another empty chinese promise . 
  that 's their thing , they promise to invest but never do . 
  knowing belgium they 'll probably give in . 
  the french can be cry-babies at times and mature governments do n't have the time/energy to deal with that . 
  unemployed , unarmed , uneducated muslims . 
  hitler and napoleon were white and european so there 's that . 
  i 'd bet all hell would brake loose if the pakistani rapist scum were polish or worse , western european . 
  what ? 
  why did n't they abort it ? 
  you want us to invade you ? 
  just go and join belgium , do n't whine when your infrastructure is all messed up after a couple of years though , 
  brabant can not into independence on its own , you need holland . 
  flanders is more interested in holland anyways , just saying . 
  brabant can into france without holland , no nordic for you guys then . 
  absolutely , tumblr might be leaking . 
  that 's not an official definition . 
  the un defines `` racial discrimination '' and nowhere do they mention religion . 
  what ? 
  why germany ? 
  we 've been waiting for flanders ever since 1830 , germany should fuck off  !, 
  what does being a `` brit '' mean these days ? 
  there 's more chance that this guy is a dress wearing long-bearded sharia preacher with his heart in the middle east than him being someone who actually cares about the uk and europe in general . 
  downvote him/it and move on . 
  you 're basically the only one who thinks it is n't funny . 
  also , no one is making a fuss . 
  i 'm just pointing out that you 're missing the point . 
  having said that , you 're entitled to your opinion . 
  moving on now , bye . 
  that 's the point , they 're joking to entertain their viewers . 
  lots of north-african muslim immigrants living there so it is an easy target . 
  the uk and france followed soon after though . 
  the moors were berbers , the arabs like to brag that andalusia was theirs exclusively , but no . 
  i 've no idea why today 's berbers allow that myth to stay alive though . 
  so what did your politicians exactly do ? 
  talk . 
   one piece of a multibillion dollar package the country needs to avoid collapse, 
  verhofstadt is really passionate about the eu , he needs to calm down . 
  absolutely . 
  people like to over-exaggerate the freaking differences between flanders and the netherlands , they 're marginal people !, 
  eastern and western germans are different , northern and southern french/italians/swedes / fins / are different , the swiss differ , the americans differ tremendously , ... 
  i hate that we 're the only thing in the western world that so obviously belongs together but the people refuse to do just that . 
  luckily , politicians and leaders on both sides disagree and come closer to each other every single day . 
   and remain a strong ally of the united states . 
  that 'll most likely never change . 
  sure , we have our disagreements at times ( same thing happens * within * the eu ) , but at the end of the day , the us is our greatest ally followed by canada and australia . 
  it 's not a huge investment . 
  people win this amount of money in the damn lottery . 
  you can be brothers with those german speaking belgians who ironically , dislike you guys . 
  oh , you can take those frenchies too . 
  we 're bros with flanders , so they 're taken . 
  $ 100 million is a drop in the bucket , this is purely symbolic . 
  what in the world ? 
  why are you that upset ? 
  you should rejoice as people in europe finally start to realize that we are n't partners , that 's what you guys wanted , is n't it ? 
  switzerland can do its thing and we 'll do ours , no `` special '' relationship , no `` special '' treatment . 
  just two neighbors , just as we 're neighbors with russia or turkey & co just as the french dude said . 
  jesus fucking christ , even after / u/gerbaire explains his situation you 're still not capable of even showing an inch of empathy . 
  just , wow !, 
  sooner or later reality will hit you guys , isolationism does n't work in the 21th century and switzerland is * not * as sovereign as your delusional politicians think .
