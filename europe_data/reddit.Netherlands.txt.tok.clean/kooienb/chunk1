  i think he 's talking about the grenade attack in the capital of djibouti ( which is also named djibouti ) . 
  [ link ! ], 
  ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/05/two-blasts-rock-djibouti-cafe-20145241974687176.html ), 
  that statement is a bit shortsighted i think . 
  the slow us growth last quarter was mainly because of the cold weather ( growth went back to normal when the weather went back to normal ) and france 's growth has been slow for a very long time because of the structural issues they have . 
  would n't the eastern ukraine the first one to be annexed next ? 
  after that kazakhstan and belarus seem like the most likely targets i think . 
  why would you want portugal in an eastern european military ? 
  no , only about 2100 soldiers and those 18 tanks are under german command . 
  it still is about 10 % of the dutch land forces though . 
  the translation by google translate is a bit shit . 
  what we have is 4700km of bicycle lanes not separated from the road ( so only sprayed red for example ) and 30300km of properly separated bicycle paths ( not tracks , those do n't get counted and we do n't have room for unpaved tracks ) . 
  denmark still has a looong way to go if they want to become a better cycle nation than the netherlands , because the only thing they are doing better right now is pr . 
  it 's like lecturing the ceo of a company while you 're working in the mail room . 
   people from the uk , belgium , france , spain and portugal especially even less relevant than belgium :(, 
  this whole post is one giant clusterfuck . 
  what the hell is an attentat !, 
  yup , we spent most of our time talking about the french occupation/revolution in the netherlands , our first constitution and the ` cultuurstelsel ' in the east-indies . 
  really . 
  i finished high school this year and i had to learn about the personal union from wikipedia . 
  the belgian independence also almost does n't get mentioned and is n't part of the stuff you are supposed to learn to pass the central history exam . 
  i do n't think it is actually , the 19th century is underrepresented in our national history curriculum . 
  there is a difference between an intra-eu surplus and an extra-eu surplus you know ... 
   the netherland 's trade surplus intra-eu is 2.5 times the size of germany 's . 
  in absolute figures . 
  when you take into account population size ... rotterdam effect . 
   belgium 's trade-surplus intra-eu is almost as high as germany 's . 
  please also consider population size here . 
  antwerp effect . 
  but most of the the packets say ` source : the netherlands ' , so there must be some secret relabeling going on if what you say is true . 
  but how do you achieve closer cooperation without transfer of powers ? 
  those eurobarometer polls also show that we 're not too fond of the idea of an ever closer union . 
  we just really like the current situation and do n't want to change it . 
  yeah , guess what , every organisation lives or dies with the opinion of big nations . 
  the eu , nato and others are great examples of that . 
  you do know the un is more than just the safety council or are you too stupid to understand that ? 
   we could as well abolish it and nobody would care . 
  no , the un is one of the most influential organizations on the damn planet . 
  abolishing the un would mean abolishing the unhcr , unicef , undp , wfp , etc. 
  saying it is better to just abolish the un is probably the most stupid thing i will hear this week . 
  groningen is an awesome place to live ( biased ) . 
  buy a bike and you 'll be fine . 
  do n't poles spell vodka with a w ? 
  suriname also became a constituent country within the kingdom of the netherlands ( to please the un/us ) in 1954 , so the the netherlands completely stopped bordering france in 1954 . 
   and correct , the country of the netherlands no longer borders the republic of france . 
  but the kingdom of the netherlands still does !, 
  the netherlands has n't shared a border with france since 1954 . 
  st. maarten was part of the netherlands antilles from 1954 until 2010 , which , just like st. maarten now , also was a constituent country within the kingdom of the netherlands . 
  you can see it on the map , the netherlands is a very light shade of blue . 
  maybe northern-europe should be number 2 ? 
  i mean , if even the united kingdom wants to be a part of it , it must be fairly prestigious . 
  nah , we 've been disconnected for about 500 years ( and even before us leaving the hre the netherlands were substantially different from the german states ) . 
  such a long divorce tends to change things . 
   the netherlands  central europe because , uhm , yes , why ? 
  possibly , but that 'll depend on what happens in the balkans . 
  if the chinese wo n't be able to build a shitton of infrastructure there ( because such a big port needs highways , train connections and an proper airport nearby ) the port of piraeus wo n't grow that much . 
  growing a port is n't easy . 
  it requires a ton of investment and good connections to a rich hinterland . 
  also , if polar shipping routes become viable , piraeus will never have an edge above rotterdam/antwerp and growth will stall . 
  it 'd have to become 22 times as big as it is now to become as big as the port of rotterdam ( which also is growing ) . 
  good luck with that , because greece would have to become economically stable and a working part of the eu to achieve that . 
  read the wiki , the swedish and belgian data is from 2013 . 
  according to the wiki the italian data is from 2015 . 
  that is n't old at all . 
  i vote for japanese !, 
  it seems like that the dutch people you have met were hippies/ecotourists . 
  ` normal ' dutch people do n't ask questions like that i think . 
  only got dutch , english , german , afrikaans and frisian . 
  the rest sounded scandinavian or like a german dialect to me . 
  or maybe , just maybe , poverty + instability and religion are to blame ? 
  and when it 's about christianity it is ... ? 
   if you 're really that patriotic , you 're in the minority . 
  so maybe it 's you that should leave , since most of the country disagrees with you :d [ citation needed ], 
  what ? 
  you do know they teach german/french in high school , right ? 
  it 's 2015 you know . 
  let 's rotate the board !, 
  in tonnage the netherlands is n't always the biggest exporter of onions , but in value the netherlands is the undisputed king of onion exports . 
  nl might not export the most amount of onions in the world , but all the onions it is exporting are of great qualify and because of that the netherlands as a country the most amount of money in the world from onion exports . 
  i looked it up too and it turns out the infographic is wrong . 
  according to this [ source ] ( http://agriexchange.apeda.gov.in/product_profile/major_exporing_countries.aspx?categorycode=0201 ) ( government of india ) the netherlands is the biggest exporter of onions in the world though . 
  we 're just overcompensating for our size . 
   flanders ( northern belgium ) even does a better job than the netherlands but they 're too small and part of belgium to score that high on the rankings . 
  do you have a source for that or are you talking out of your arse again ? 
  it 's very sensible to think that is why the netherlands is such a big exporter of agricultural products , but it 's actually wrong . 
  we are one of the biggest producers of agricultural products * in value * ( important ! ), 
  because we produce a shitton of very expensive products like flowers ( flowers are worth way more than things like potatoes ) . 
  stuff that we reexport without adding value to it is n't counted in the official figures . 
  some extra facts : - the netherlands exports 1/4 of the world 's tomatoes . 
  - ~ ~ the netherlands is the biggest producer of onions ** in the world ** . ~ ~ the netherlands is the biggest exporter of onions in the world . 
  - the netherlands exports 45,2 % of the worlds flower bouquets . 
  - the netherlands is responsible for 22 % of the world 's potato exports . 
  - more than half of the netherlands ' total land surface of 4.15 million hectares is used as farmland . 
  56 percent if used for arable and horticultural crops , 42 percent is permanent grassland and 2 percent is used for permanent crops .

  i liked learning german at school because it is such a structured language . 
  french was a bitch though , i dropped it as soon as it was possible . 
   constructing ' artificial islands ( belgium ) belgium has artificial islands ?
