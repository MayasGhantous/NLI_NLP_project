  greece is a nation to the east of the adriatic . 
  it contained some of the greatest philosophers in history , and it gained independence from the ottoman empire in the 1830s . 
  its culture mostly derives from the late eastern roman empire , or byzantine empire . 
  even though the byzantine empire fell in 1453 , greek culture would live on in the mani peninsula , by the maniots who would later join greek insurgents during the greek war of independence . 
  in the 1920 's , following the first world war the greek people tried to take defeat turkey to complete the megali idea . 
  however , this failed . 
  later , ionnas metaxas became the fascist leader of greece , being the only fascist fighting on the allied side . 
  he also envisioned a `` third hellenic civilization '' with alexander 's greece being the first , and the byzantine greece being the second . 
  this idea died with him .

  edit : why do you downvote ? 
  are you really that sad of a person that you have little fits of spite and have to reach out through a medium that has nothing to do with validity ? 
  you do realize karma is worthless right ? 
  and that downvoting a comment does n't do anything to the legitimacy of what 's in the post right ? 
  or do you just ignore all of that because you 're butthut and have to lash out like a baby in need of a circumcision ? 
  i mean seriously !, 
  you ca n't have a conversation with someone on the internet without angrily clicking the downvote button ? 
  do you feel like you 've had vengeance on me or something ? 
  i personally do n't care about downvotes either way ( by all means , call your silly downvote brigade on me , it means nothing at all to me ) , but i just find it funny how seriously you and others like yourself actually take these imaginary internet points . 
  reddit really is all you have , huh ? 
  damn do i feel bad for you . 
  but you know what ? 
  i do n't care !, 
  you 're logic is flawed , kiddo . 
  do n't like what people are doing with it ? 
  downvote me , that 'll show 'em !, 
  go ahead and press that down arrow , i know you 're itching to do it . 
  think you 're contributing to the community ? 
  `` doing your civic duty '' ? 
  nope . 
  you 're just decreasing a meaningless number on the internet . 
  you just want to hop on the bandwagon . 
  well pounce !, 
  o can hear you as your feet land on the cold real steel of the inside of the wagon . 
  you know what ?
