if your neighbor kills his family are you embarrassed and ashamed ? 
  if not , why would you be for someone whom you do n't even know ? 
  i know that dutch people call dutch citizens of moroccan origin who were born in the netherlands immigrants but this is not want immigrant means . 
  immigrant is a person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country . 
  and foreign country is a country one is not a citizen of . 
  so foreign citizens living permanently = immigrant ( unless you come from a western country , and in this case you 're allowed to call yourself an expat ) . 
  unrelated to the topic : thanks for posting in french and english !, 
  i 'm learning french right know and this is helpful . 
  yes , i 'm the one of the romanianbulgarian organized crime members who invaded nl . 
  why the fuck would i deny there is a invasion of beggars in nl ? 
  am i denying there are is an invasion of romanian beggars in sweeden ? 
  you are the one full of shit : `` in amsterdam is not so bad with the beggers '' . 
  right , because there is none . 
  nice comparison there . 
  the rapist are exactly like beggars . 
  every day they come to the city center , they sit in their spot and start rapping people . 
  the police ca n't do anything about it even though they could have arrest them since is illegal to rape people . 
  `` the argument `` problem x is n't a problem , because in place y it 's way worse than here ! '', 
  is retarded . '', 
  no , you 've said an `` invasion '' , not `` a problem '' . 
  and it 's a lie . 
  there is no invasion in the netherlands . 
  dude : 1 . 
  i 've lived in the hague for 2 years . 
  in 2012 i was in the hague . 
  i do not recall such a problem with the beggars . 
  you have no idea how bad the situation is in stockholm . 
  that is an invasion . 
  since the banning was introduced in 2012 there should not be any more problems in 2014 , right ? 
  the way you 've posted the message was suggesting the whole country is invated by beggars `` literally flood the streets with beggars '' which is a straight forward lie . 
  the netherlands does not have any problem with beggars , no matter which nationality they have . 
  c'mon , stop the lies with romanianbulgarian beggars . 
  of course i got out of the house . 
  and in the center there were only some street musicians , like this one : http://static2.ad.nl/static/photo/2013/13/7/14/20130424102624/media_xll_1621739.jpg, 
  no , i know . 
  i 've lived in the hague for 2 years ( in the last 4 years ) and i 've kinda missed this beggar invasion you 're talking about . 
  when you say is n't that bad , it means there are beggars but not so many , right ? 
  where are the beggars ? 
  i live in amsterdam and i bicycle every day / every weekend , i go to different locations in amsterdam and other cities in the randstad . 
  i have n't seen any beggar . 
  and which other city besides the hague is invaded with these romanianbulgarian beggars ? 
  i 've been there last week . 
  rotterdam - none , den helder none . 
  there has to be news articles about this `` beggar invasion '' , right ? 
  if it 's that bad . 
  could you post a few links to such articles ? 
  wow , the streets are flooded with romanian and bulgarian beggars . 
  the beggars are everywhere . 
  jesus , what a lie . 
  could you give me an example ( or maybe more ) . 
  where are the beggars in the hague ? 
  where are the beggars in amsterdam ? 
  most gypsy people live like this : http://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-586284-galleryv9-wtlw.jpg or this : http://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-586294-galleryv9-gvmi.jpg so yes , i would say they look like poor people to me . 
  romania does have the largest roma population in europe , but it 's only 9 % of population ( same as in slovakia for example ) . 
  there are other countries is eastern europe with large roma population : bulgaria , hungary , slovakia , serbia : source ( european council ) : http://cdn3.spiegel.de/images/image-585996-galleryv9-djdq.jpg . 
  so saying 92 % of roma gypsies came from romania is a bit stupid . 
  but i do n't even know why i bother replying to you . 
  what does some roma gypsy gang in ireland has to do with romania ? 
  there is nothing in that article about romanians , in fact nowhere in the article there is mentioned the gang members citizenship . 
  i 've never seen beggars in nl and i 've traveled to a lot of dutch cities , only some people playing music in the street , but most of them were dutch . 
  i meant the article is stupid . 
  the pathetic british press as usual , oh look how bad other countries are doing . 
  because there are 2000 people standing in a queue does not mean anything . 
  in uk there are 1500 people standing in a queue for jobs . 
  what conclusion do you draw from this ? 
  well , it 's the same in uk : `` 1,500 queue for just 40 supermarket jobs '' http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/466520/employment-crisis-1-500-queue-for-just-40-supermarket-jobs, 
  the problem is that the controversial statements were made about moroccans and the moroccans he was talking about were dutch citizens , they are born in the netherlands and in many cases their parents are also . 
  romanians ( and bulgarians ) do not have the right to work at least until 2019 so i really doubt they are `` enraged '' or that they particularly cared about working in switzerland when they can work in the whole eu . 
  no one thinks is switzerland duty to hire unemployed and unskilled worker from other countries . 
  it 's about breaking a treaty they signed . 
  what 's so hard to understand this ? 
  hmm , i 'm not sure how much of a romanian invention `` mici '' is . 
  this is cevapi : http://www.flickr.com/photos/su-lin/4511498869/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%86evapi, 
  hmm , according to the article one of them is a is the gypsy criminal . 
  which one ? 
  i only see an italian , a constructor worker , and a rat with an eu flag t-shirt . 
  what 's that has to do with gypsies ? 
  i did not contest the fact that eastern europe are all net recipients , but the statement that they get `` huge amount of money '' . 
  yes , taken as absolute numbers they get a lot of money , but if you calculate as a percentage , what eastern europe get is not that much . 
  but is always eastern europe bashing , how the eastern europe is a burden to the western europe when for instance estonia gets 400 mil eur , slovakia gets 500 mil eur . 
  portugal gets 3.2 billions extra . 
  most of the eu budget goes to western europe countries . 
  if you look at this chart ( data for 2012 ) : http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-spending-contributions-european-union ( source : http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) you can easily see that except poland , most of the eastern countries get small amounts . 
  for example , in case of romania + bulgaria they get 3.7 billions and they contribute 1.5 billions , so in fact 2.2 billions . 
  in western eu : portugal gets 3.2 billions extra , spain gets around 4 billions extra , and greece gets around 5 billions extra . 
  and the german doctors were hired in australia because they were cheap immigrants , right ? 
  there is no shortage of doctors in australia . 
  the australian doctors just refuse to work on those salaries . 
  actually , what do you know about the romanian vocational training system ? 
  well , you think it sucks , because romania . 
  that 's your proof . 
  at this moment , the vocational training in romania is done in the same way as in germany : you have schools who have contracts with factories and the students are trained in the factories for a number of hours ( days ) per week . 
  this is one of the schools : http://www.sgk.ro/ro/ ( translated school name is kronstadt german vocational school ) if you look at the bottom you 'll see quite a few german companies that have factories in romania where these students are trained . 
  i do n't think skilled workers are hired based on their price , i.e : who 's the cheapest gets the job . 
  i was asked how much i want only at the last stage of every job interview i had . 
  if you 're a ( skilled ) unemployed person you do n't say : oh , it 's a piece of cake to get a job , i 'll just have to be the cheapest one . 
  yes , but i would not have payed 2000 eur , i would have rather install the parquet myself ( or use something else cheaper ) than to pay 2000 eur . 
  and this point is missed by many . 
  because some person is asking a price it does not mean that there is someone willing to pay for it . 
  so well , if it costs 2000 eur i 'm not buy it and if i can buy something cheaper it does not mean you 've lost 2000 eur .
