the real fact is , that this comes from a billionaire , who lives on his own private island in the caribbean ... 
  i have to admit i did n't go further than the title  but still . 
  i also find it hard to believe that the eu does not want to cooperate with the brittish army . 
  it 's just more fear mongering , if you ask me . 
  the title says it all : * could be ... * just wait until vw starts building cars with build-in galileo navigators . 
  i find it hard to believe that the uk is being left out . 
  i 'm more curious to the opposite . 
  what is the eu going to say if the uk is doing fine , with being a member state of the eu ? 
  and what are ( the people of ) other member states going to say ? 
   we fled this kind of terrorism and it is following us here well ... 
  if you point them out , that would be very helpfull ... everybody wins . 
  all the bits of information help , you know . 
  we 're confident you can contribute . 
  and we make sure you can do it anonymously ... 
  also not true . 
  wilders has a problem with certain questionable aspects of islam teachings . 
  things like the supression of woman , discrimination agains non-muslims , the call to destroy isra\u00ebl , murder all jews , jihad against the west and the desire to introduce sharia law in the netherlands ( and other western countries ) . 
  a really ca n't say i disagree with that view . 
   someone who disagrees with people simply because of their heritage sorry to burst your bubble , but this is simply not true . 
  wilders himself said this in an [ interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvuvxdtz5i8 ) . 
  he does n't have a problem with muslims at all . 
  he has a problem with immigrants ( that mostly happen to be muslims ... ) who behave like complete assholes and refuse to adopt out western values . 
  to put it bluntly : * `` if you do n't behave , you 're not welcome . 
  that 's the thing . 
  on paper they could lift the borders , but in reality they will always exist . 
  especially in europe . 
  because europe is a vast collection of many different ethnicities , cultures and languages . 
  borders define and protect that . 
  that 's why we have them in the first place . 
  so , yeah , people will see it as a thread when burocrats start messing with their borders . 
  and rightfully so , imho . 
  i also do n't see the need to lift borders . 
  or why we need brussels . 
  i like germans , brits , french , etc for what they are . 
  we can get along just fine , without being forced into a european burocratic nightmare , where a small group of unelected burocrats dictate the member states what to do and what not to do , with little respect for who we are . 
  i very much agree with nigel farage , when he said : * `` i understand europe much better than those burocrats in brussels '' * nationalism and patrionism have been twisted to words with a negative meaning . 
  but in reality , it 's a beautifull thing . 
  there is nothing wrong with loving your country , wat it stands for and wanting to protect it . 
  to put it into perspective . 
  i get along great with my neighbours . 
  but knocking down the walls between our homes and tearing down the fence between out yard will end in tears . 
  and if you 're afraid that europe will be plunged into war , as soon as we lift brussels , i 'm not concerned about that at all . 
  my generation ( i 'm 35 ) grew up with a very international mindset . 
  we like to explore and know other cultures and we love and appreciate them for what they are . 
  the next generation even more so . 
  we need each other for trade and we know it . 
  with democratic governments , it 's a lot harder to declare ware . 
  and nowadays , annexing land through conquest just does n't work anymore . 
  so , there you have it . 
  i 'm very nationalistic and anti-eu . 
  but that does n't mean i think we should lock our borders and mind our own business . 
  on the contrary !, 
  i 'm very much in favor of international cooperation and working together . 
  ** truely ** working together . 
  with mutual respect and appreciation for each other . 
  you are the exeption , not the rule . 
  most people get born and die in the same country . 
  because most people identify with their own nationality , heritage , culture , history , language , etc. 
  in my own case , i feel dutch , not european . 
  and that is why most people see globalism as a thread to the very things they identify themselves with . 
  i disagree . 
  and that 's putting it mildly . 
  probably making empty promises . 
  how she would prevent burocratic insanity from brussels that will totally destroy them . 
  like the [ discard ban ] ( http://www.antidiscardban.eu/en/ ) . 
  try [ lekturama luistersprookjes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdm3vadykb4&amp;list=plzjt2hg3hh1jxklzq9pyoves6fti7woh8 ) . 
  these are books with common and well known fairy tales . 
  anyone who grew up in the netherlands during the 80-ties and 90-ties is familiar with these . 
  * the narrating is professional and easy to follow . 
  * the stories are well-know in most countries and cultures , making it more easy to understand . 
  * you can read along . 
  he is just speaking slower/more clearly than other dutch people, 
  it 's [ alexander pechtold ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_pechtold ) reminiscing how he went to paris , with [ halbe zijlstra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halbe_zijlstra ) , to attent the opening of a [ rembrandt exposition ] ( https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/kaplan-louvre-rembrandt-vermeer-869633 ) in the louvre . 
  on the way back he drove through a pothole on the infamous belgian roads and lost his gearbox , totalling the car . 
  the belgian roads [ motivate dutch politicians ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adxfmiaay_g ) to keep our roads nice . 
  what about [ urk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urk ) ? 
  it was an island before . 
  i assume it will still be an island today , if the dikes were removed ? 
  taking offense in every little thing or comment does n't help anyone . 
  people seriously need to chill out these days . 
  ** if ** they want ... 
  but yeah , there was a bit of stereotype mixed in there , 
  my point is that any nation should be free to run their country however they see fit and deal with the consequences themselves . 
  good or bad . 
  a borderline dictatorship in brussels dictating ( pardon the pun ) all memberstates what and what not to do , does n't allow for that . 
  in my mind , the eu is a runaway train and should be brought back to it 's roots . 
  the eeg . 
   the fact that it would make the entire eurozone , and thus the internal market , more stable and richer [ ... ] i am very pessimistic and sceptic about that . 
  in contrast of the usa , europe is a patchwork of many different cultures and mentalities that will never be forced into a made-up-uniform-this-is-the-european . 
  there is still the us-and-them mentality ^ \\ ( * ) and i never see that going away . 
  and you know what ? 
  that is fine . 
  why should it be a problem ? 
  let the french be french , the germans be german , the greek be greek and so on . 
  we can get along just fine without brussels telling us what to do . 
  if the greek want to retire at 53 ? 
  fine !, 
  but let them pay for it themselves . 
  the same goes for the french . 
  and let the dutch work until they are 65-67 , because they do n't mind going that extra mile for a high standard of living .
