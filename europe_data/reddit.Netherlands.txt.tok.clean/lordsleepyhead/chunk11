  and well , if painting your face black is going to categorically be considered offensive for ever and ever until the end of time , fine , whatever , so be it . 
   this has finally opened the doors to a discussion that we should have had a long time ago . 
  i dunno , because first of all , the discussion has been going on for * years * now , and schools , parents , and the sinterklaas-committee are all poised towards gradually changing zwarte piet over the course of many years , to unnoticeably phase out the part where he looks like a blackface character . 
  second , by dragging this out into the open and having all kinds of high officials speak out about it , it is actually * enforcing * the hidden racism that still exists in many dutch people . 
  it provokes them to break out and find in eachother a social acceptance of racism that only encourages their behaviour . 
  this way racism refuses to die because they 're constantly rekindling the fire . 
  huh ? 
  what the fuck do muslims have to do with any of this ? 
  goddammit some people are so fucking stupid , they 're ruining it for the rest of us . 
   you should acknowledge that we do . 
  every damn year . 
  foreigner : `` wtf ?? 
  '' , us : `` yeah , i know how this looks , sorry . 
  he 's a nice guy though , no negative stereotype intended . '', 
  but sometimes this is followed with a : `` that 's not good enough !, 
  you are obviously all racists !, 
  stop it immediately ! '', 
  and then we 're like : `` no . '', 
  i can understand what you 're saying . 
  i imagine dealing with racism day in day out would make you sensitive to these things . 
  a few points though :  see them be able to take off that wig and wipe off that paint at the end of the day and get back to being white . 
  they ca n't take off their hair like a wig this strikes me as really racist . 
  it sounds like you 're implying black people would actually rather be white and are sad that they are n't . 
  another thing is that dressing up with hair and make-up is not always blackface , in the sense that it is making fun of ` the black man ' . 
  dressing up like a circus clown with pasty white make-up and a big red nose is not a caricature of ` the white man ' , he 's a fictional character and so is zwarte piet . 
  zwarte piet only became definitively established as the companion to sinterklaas in the 19th century , by which time he was a convoluted mess of different characters , both real and folkloric . 
  before zwarte piet took centre stage , saint nicolas either came alone , or with any type of different krampus or sack man-like characters . 
  there was no one true story ; all that mattered was that it was a story that had both a festive element and an element to scare children into good behaviour . 
  now at the time the story finally crystallized into the form as we recognize it today , catholicism was oppressed in the netherlands and contact between dutch protestants and spanish catholic dignitaries was non-existent . 
  what * was * still a fresh and traumatic memory , though , was the threat of the barbary pirates who would regularly capture european sailors into slavery right up into the 19th century . 
  yeah , those pro-zwarte piet , anti- `` zeurpiet '' comments are completely over the line , detrimental to any kind of discussion , and quite obviously racist . 
  what occurred to me , though , is this : * yes , zwarte piet is black * yes , he bears a resemblance to historical american blackface theatre * yes , i can see how someone can take offence in that but * the character is not a slave * he is not stupid , lazy , or a criminal * he is a fictional character , like santa 's elves or the easter bunny so the offensive part about zwarte piet comes from this train of thought : * `` on the surface , this character looks like this other character that i find offensive , therefore they are similar enough that this character is equally offensive to me as that other character . 
  '' * in this way , there is indeed no denying that zwarte piet can quite plausibly cause people to take offence . 
  that still does n't make it racist though . 
   obvious racial undertones to black pete absolutely . 
  he 's black . 
  i heard that one too . 
  i think there are about 10 different origin stories for zwarte piet . 
  there is no ` official ' one . 
  you know , this occurred to me : just because someone is offended , does n't automatically make it racist . 
   i 'm not sure about it , but i think it 's actually where `` knight '' comes from in english that 's right . 
   the moorish pirates came from north africa , and they were n't very black at all . 
  well , that 's where the whole mix-up starts of course , because the truth is , dutch people of the time were totally ignorant of the different peoples living around the mediterranean . 
  as far as the dutch were concerned , everyone there was `` black '' , simply because they were not light haired and pale skinned like people in the north . 
  there was a lot of exaggeration going on . 
  the whole point of zwarte piet is that they needed a story device to scare children into behaving , and a mediterranean pirate who would kidnap you and take you away to a far away , scary , foreign country fit the bill perfectly . 
  during festivities , people would dress up as zwarte piet , and since they had to disguise themselves so the children would n't recognize their fathers and uncles , they would use soot to darken their skin , simply because soot was cheap and readily available , and sort of approximated the darker skin colour , as the dutch saw it , of anyone living south of the mediterranean . 
  this is probably where the absurdly black skin of zwarte piet comes from ( and maybe even where the other , seemingly absurd , explanation comes from that piet is ` black from the soot of the chimney ' ? ) . 
  in the end , the result of years and years of mistranslations , exaggerations , practical considerations and general ignorance have turned zwarte piet into the character we see today , who strongly resembles old-timey american blackface theatre , and as such is perceived as offensive . 
  do n't feel bad . 
  dutch people in the olden days were completely ignorant about spain , except that it 's this far away country we were once at war with , and that at some point it was full of scary dark-skinned moorish people . 
  `` spain '' was just placeholder for `` a scary place you do n't wan na go to '' of course nowadays we come by the thousands and act like assholes on your beaches . 
  i dunno , if a dutch farmer hires a * knecht * , it 's not a serf . 
  it 's just a boy who does odd jobs around the farm for low pay . 
  afraid not . 
  but in any case , this is why zwarte piet wears colourful 17th century clothing and is decked out in gold and exotic feathers . 
  the schoolteacher who codified the version of zwarte piet as we know him today needed a ` plausible ' version of a [ sack man ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sack_man ) and came up with a moorish pirate . 
  get this : [ zwarte piet ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/zwartepiet.png ) actually * is * related to slavery in a way , but it 's not how you 'd expect . 
  in the various saint nicolas traditions of europe , the saint , who is patron saint of children , is [ accompanied by evil beings in some form or another ] ( http://www.ripleys.com/weird/files/2011/10/krampus2xx.jpg ) whose job it is to punish bad children . 
  in 17th century holland , as it was a seafaring nation , the most evil thing imaginable was the moorish pirates of north africa who would raid your ship , capture you , and sell you off into slavery . 
  so in the netherlands , saint nicolas ' helper became black pete , a nasty pirate who would kidnap you and take you off to his faraway country where you would never see your beloved parents again . 
  today this origin story is forgotten by 99 % of dutch people , and zwarte piet is n't evil any more . 
  the holiday has become more child friendly . 
  but at the end of the day the connection between zwarte piet and slavery is actually a valid one , except zwarte piet is not a slave , but a slave trader . 
  so if this is true , the countries in central asia , the middle east and africa are absolutely right when they say we 're imperialists ? 
   people with lots of money telling people with no money they need to pay shit they borrowed back . 
  i 'm sorry , but this is a sweeping statement lumping a whole country into one single entity , and as such is ineffective at refuting the central point you do n't agree with . 
  in the specific case of greece , it was the rich greeks who created the debt , but it is the poor greeks who are now paying for it . 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  maybe it 's a wag the dog ? 
  i know russia 's gazprom is trying to close a deal with our gasunie , which will effectively mean russia will control our natural gas supply . 
  either someone is stirring up shit to frustrate the deal , or someone on the other side is stirring up shit to draw attention away from the ( unpopular ) deal . 
  incidentally , the greenpeace operation from a few weeks ago was directed against a gazprom drilling platform . 
  no more than any other western european country . 
  in fact , during the dutch golden age , czar peter the great came over to the netherlands to study shipbuilding and was so enamoured by amsterdam , he decided to model the inner city of st petersburg after it with canals and such . 
  hahahaha , busted , rosbif !, 
  to be fair , there 's always quite an amount of rainbow flags in amsterdam , regardless of what time of year it is or whether anybody important is visiting . 
  when someone graduates high school , it is customary to fly the dutch flag with a school bag hanging from the flagpole to signify this to the neighbourhood . 
  aside from weapons there are also the options of mind games , psychological abuse , emotional blackmail and shaming , which women on average seem to be better at than men . 
  and if all else fails , there 's always poison . 
  local city newspaper * parool * did a series called * amsterdam onbewolkt * ( amsterdam on a clear day ) , of which you can view some photos [ here ] ( http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/2848/foto/photoalbum/detail/2817540/303156/0/amsterdam-onbewolkt.dhtml#photo ) . 
  alternatively , you can just [ google image search `` amsterdam onbewolkt '' ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=amsterdam+onbewolkt&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=co5buuhgb5gb0wxjp4cobg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1304&amp;bih=689&amp;dpr=1 ) to get ton more of this series .

  yes .

  many river barges are n't the small family business ships they used to be . 
  [ shipping by river is serious business these days . 
  port of vlissingen is pretty big . 
  it 's not just me then . 
  thank you . 
  jesus christ , you are literally too stupid to argue with . 
   a ferry company 's decision to change its routes and thus delay the opening of alternative and cheaper ice roads to certain islands i understand this can be hugely frustrating to those affected , but can someone explain how this is so awful that it generates threatening and offensive comments and insults ? 
   well , then you agree that perhaps bulgaria and romania were not ready ? 
  yes , but that 's not for lack of trying . 
   what in make bosnia ready then ? 
  the question is not whether bosnia is ready * now * . 
  the question is if it is possible bosnia will be ready for it some time in the future . 
   if we had proper checks , they will not be let in , that is perhaps cruel , but true . 
  they are not going to be allowed to join tomorrow . 
  the way it works is that an assessment is made whether the country in question can be ready at some point in the future .
