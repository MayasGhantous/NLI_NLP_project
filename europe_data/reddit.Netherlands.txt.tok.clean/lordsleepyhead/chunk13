  you 're good !, 
  i 'm aware that dutch drug policies are hard to understand and create false stereotypes about us , but let me put this into simple terms : 1 . 
  greenpeace activists \u2260 hippies . 
  these are professional troublemakers who take calculated risks , not free love advocates who wear baggy , flowery clothes and misunderstand buddhism . 
  the dutch drug policy deals with pot , not opium , what the russians claim to have ` found ' on the ship . 
  yes , we all do drugs in the netherlands . 
  this obviously fries our brains to the point where we 're stupid enough to take opium with us when we try to get ourselves arrested by the russians . 
   claims it 's related to the greenpeace affair . 
  this i highly doubt i think it 's very much related to the greenpeace affair . 
  russia is notorious for having drunk diplomats all over the world who get themselves arrested , upon which russia can technically claim the country violated the treaty of vienna and hold it against them during other diplomatic negotiations . 
  so in effect , what russia is doing is abusing diplomatic loopholes to gather ammo to diplomatically blackmail countries who are n't doing what they want . 
  also , i think greenpeace is not a victim in all this : getting arrested and causing diplomatic ties to worsen between the two countries is exactly what they want . 
  it does n't have anything to do with the gazprom offshore drilling platform itself ; it 's about worsening ties between russia and the netherlands in order to frustrate the deal between gazprom and gasunie , a deal which will essentially allow gazprom to own our domestic natural gas market ( making it near impossible to enforce our own environmental regulations on our natural gas consumption ) . 
   old russians customs trick they 're using an old russian customs trick in a high-level diplomacy dispute ? 
  tax on tobacco on the other hand balances it back out . 
  it both was and was n't , depending on what was being taught . 
  it 's these stereotypes the russian government is hoping to exploit . 
  maybe it will be only just believable enough that the public buys it . 
  i remember during the us ' republican primaries , the netherlands was a favourite talking point for those candidates to spread falsehoods about . 
  we were this liberal socialist hell-hole where everyone was on drugs , children were forced to become gay , and we killed the elderly . 
  by the way , it was n't pot they claimed they found . 
  it was opium . 
   the source of countless mournful folk songs . 
  which in turn became part of the recipe of what was later to become pop music . 
  i wonder if the russian government realizes how silly this claim sounds , that greenpeace sailed up to the arctic to protest and be general troublemakers with about 99 % certainty they would get arrested ( it 's what they 're actually counting on ) , but decided to take a bunch of drugs with them for no clear purpose whatsoever . 
   a housing bubble burst recently haha , the housing bubble has n't burst yet . 
  it 's about to , though . 
  i 'm surprised netherlands is so high up on all 3 of these you posted . 
  i was actually under the impression our education system was less than adequate . 
  russia is trying to hold on to influence in former soviet territories by making them economically interdependent through the eurasian customs union . 
  any trade deal struck with other economic blocs , especially powerful ones , seriously threatens the `` inter - '' part of the `` dependence = influence '' scheme . 
  make baby formula . 
  sell to china . 
  they 're importing the stuff by the kajillion tons a second ever since they stopped trusting their own domestic formula after the poison scandals . 
  just going through the diplomatic motions . 
  business as usual , really . 
  i was thinking of aquaman , but this is good too . 
   you were more or less outside the ( remnants ) of the pillarized society i think i was one leg inside , one leg out . 
  british dad , dutch mum . 
  imagine how unsettling it was to me , as a small kid , to read about the four anglo-dutch wars in * van nul tot nu * . 
  i did n't know who to root for !, 
    what were the `` van nul tot nu '' accents ? 
  i 'd say , in my opinion , * van nul tot nu * is a standard `` vaderlandsche geschiedenis '' narrative , simplified for children , but told with more nuance and relativism ( for instance , it does n't sugarcoat dutch conduct in indonesia , or the poverty that existed during the golden age despite the money being made by the merchant class )  quite a few people of these generations are still around !, 
  and even though you distance yourself from it , you only have to listen to wilders and his followers to know that for some these stories are very much alive i absolutely agree with you . 
  the point i took issue with is that you equated this narrative with vpro , which i think could n't be further from the truth . 
  ( and probably was n't true for the pseudo-philosophical , guitar strumming , `` jesus was just far-out , man '' types of the christian left in the 60s either ), 
   how old were you when you had your primary education ? 
  the same as eveybody else : 6 to 12 . 
  i think you mean `` how long ago did you have your primary education ? '', 
  to which the answer would be `` 30 years ago '' . 
  i was brought up on a diet of * vpro-gidsen * , my british dad 's british history books , a library card , and * van nul tot nu * . 
  so yes , there 's your `` vaderlandsche geschiedenis , '' but it 's really not as relevant as you think , apart from being something my grandparents were taught , an archaic version of history that 's historically interesting in itself . 
  something people used to tell eachother to form a narrative about themselves . 
  i 'd agree with you , except that this change happened more than 40 years ago . 
  if a portion of christian left members stuck with the organisation back then out of tradition , they 're mostly dead now . 
  the vpro have been making a certain type of programming since the 1970s , and the result is not a slow dying off of their membership . 
  instead , they 're still going strong . 
  obviously , their ` image ' , or ` branding ' , or whatever , is something people today still want to subscribe to . 
  even today , when visiting someone , and you see a * vpro gids * lying on their coffee table , it projects off this subconscious image : * `` these people are progressive , educated , intellectual , '' * something like that . 
  does n't necessarily make it true about that particular person , but that 's what the brand projects . 
  besides , i 'm not even sure the `` christian left '' even exists any more , as an identifiable school of thought at least . 
  i think rensch did a good job at setting up a first post , and anarchistica did great at some much needed quality control . 
   on a sunday afternoon in the 70s the vpro and their membership went from total protestantism to total secularism what ? 
  that 's the exact opposite of what i 'm asserting . 
  you said :  your version of vaderlandsche geschiedenis was obviously more influenced by a ** leftish-protestant ** view ( i.e. 
  vpro ) to which i said :  one of the few broadcasting organisations that consistently makes documentary programmes that look at our history with a critical note then the discussion took a turn :  do you know what vpro actually stood for ??? 
  which struck me as odd , because that is n't relevant to anything vpro has made since the 70s :  i know what vpro stood for , although it does n't mean a thing in relation to what the organisation stands for today you went on :  the fact that people are a member of the vpro does not mean they are the same as the vpro . 
  i used the vpro as shorthand for the left protestant paasheuvel crowd/pillar . 
  again , the association with the christian left has long been non-existent :  vpro has n't had anything to do with the christian left since at least the 70s you :  so the fact the vpro suddenly changed course did not mean all those members suddenly walked away did they ? 
  obviously not , because that would have been the end of the organisation . 
  so why did n't they all suddenly walk away ? 
   the members did n't walk away when the vpro changed course is due to the fact that * its members had already become mostly secularised * , and the organisation merely followed suit check this out :  *** its members had already become mostly secularised *** you :  change - historical change - is a * process * and not a sudden change exactly !, 
  the * process * of secularisation had long been happening within the membership of vpro ( and its programmes were hardly religious anymore too ) . 
  by the end of the 1960s , the protestant roots of the vpro had become so irrelevant , that they changed their organisation structure to no longer include ministers , and they started to do risqu\u00e9 programmes aimed at the young people of the 60s and 70s . 
  since then , vpro has mostly done documentaries , high-brow comedy , and slightly off-beat children 's programming . 
  it 's mission is no longer protestant . 
  it 's members are no longer protestant ( or if they are , it 's not the reason they choose vpro ) . 
  there is nothing about vpro these days that is relevant to the christian left . 
  look , i 'm not sure what you 're trying to say here . 
  that vpro is n't secular ? 
  that it is , but its members are n't ? 
  that there was or was n't a big change in direction in the 1970s ? 
  please restate your assertion so i do n't have to go spend time looking stuff up for you if it means you 'll just dance around the facts . 
  the fact that the members did n't walk away when the vpro changed course is due to the fact that its members had already become mostly secularised , and the organisation merely followed suit . 
  whatchu on about , man ? 
  vpro has n't had anything to do with the christian left since at least the 70s . 
  yes , i know what vpro stood for , although it does n't mean a thing in relation to what the organisation stands for today . 
  in the end though , vpro is the closest dutch programming comes to making bbc-quality documentaries . 
   your case where your version of vaderlandsche geschiedenis was obviously more influenced by a leftish-protestant view ( i.e. 
  excuse me ? 
  in fact , * de gouden eeuw * was a direct response to jan peter balkenende 's unfortunate speech in which he suggested we should rekindle our `` voc-mentaliteit '' . 
  balkenende 's speech was met with laughter and ridicule , but goedkoop decided he 'd actually look into it objectively , instead of going along with the politically correct mantra that we were all horrible slave trading brutes who built our fortune with violence and blood money . 
  it 's a good programme , you should check it out if you have n't already . 
  well , there was [ a permanent settlement ] ( http://www.vadertjestaat.nl/bin/new-amsterdam-new-york-spier-1048.jpg ) with houses and a city wall and a governor and everything , but the dutch themselves were n't very interested in settling there ( life was pretty good in the old country at the time ) , which is reflected in how the first governors managed the island : more like a company with employees rather than like a town with citizens . 
  as a result of ordinary dutch people not being very interested in settling there , and the governor 's policy of not allowing tradesmen to form guilds , many english , german , french and swedish people came and settled there instead , since they would be allowed to practice a trade without having to be allowed into a guild . 
  this resulted in new amsterdam becoming the first cultural ` melting pot ' of the north american continent , a continuity which carries right through to present-day new york . 
   the arrows on motorway signs point in the wrong direction ( down instead of up for straight ahead ) . 
  misconception . 
  there are signs with up arrows too , which do in fact mean `` straight ahead , '' however the ones with the down arrows mean `` get in this lane '' . 
  this is excellent .
