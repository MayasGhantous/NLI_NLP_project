  i think a critical reader can learn to recognize these types of headlines . 
  anything that reads '' ( mister so-and-so ) denies doing ( this-and-that ) '' or `` did ( mister so-and-so ) do ( this-and-that ) ? '', 
  is basically a news editor declaring `` warning : following article contains baseless claims but we wanted to publish it anyway because bullshit sells ! '', 
  i suggest a moderator put a `` misleading title '' tag on the submission then ?

  ** netherlands ** i like the film [ ober ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/waiter_%28film%29 ) , by alex van warmerdam , who recently did [ borgman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borgman_%28film%29 ) , which will the dutch entry for the next oscars . 
  yeah new amsterdam was settled by the dutch and administered by the dutch but from the get-go it was already kind of a hodgepodge of european nationalities . 
  wow , way to get the facts wrong . 
  our deputy justice minister is not albayrak but fred teeven . 
  anyway , the main issue this article is getting wrong is this : we 're not closing prisons because somehow magically our crime rate has drastically fallen , we 're closing them because over the past 10 years or so we built too many . 
  the reason was this : for the past 10 years or so politicians have been promising to get tougher on crime , and to increase prison sentences , but the fact of the matter is that conviction rates and jail sentences were already quite adequate and upping prison sentences just to score political points really has nothing to do with justice . 
  so the politicians ordered all these prisons to be built expecting they would be needed , which they were n't , and now it 's become too expensive . 
  i kind of suspect they knew this though , and i think it was just another massive scam to give real estate developers more lucrative projects . 
  i 've seen this happen in my country in many public sectors : school mergers , reorganization of police force , all of them measures to supposedly cut costs and be more efficient , but they always seem to involve building a massively expensive new building . 
  [ the veluwe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ymd4i.jpg ) is quite nice , only instead of running into foreign tourists , you 'll run into droves of elderly dutch tourists instead . 
  amsterdam 's chinatown has street signs in chinese , but that 's not really what you mean is it ? 
   general civilized dutch we simply call it general dutch now ... 
  ooh , i know this one !, 
  is it germany ? 
  by seeing this as an excellent opportunity to sell out every single public service into privatization . 
   ( about the size of romania )   the north speaks flanders [ great start for this series op !, 
  :d ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/005/970/i-can-count-to-potato.jpg ), 
  there are . 
  http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/lijst_van_nederlandse_bieren here are a few i like : * [ la trappe dubbel ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_trappe_dubbel ) * [ jopen extra stout ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/jopen_extra_stout ) * [ ' t ij natte ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/natte ) * [ brand up ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/brand_up ) * [ gulpener ur-amber ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulpener_biologisch_ur-amber ) then there 's [ this one ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/i.p.a . ), 
  which is brilliant but unfortunately it 's a limited edition and is hard to get . 
  and of course then there 's the good old trusty [ hertog-jan ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/hertog_jan_pilsener ), 
  that . 
  was . 
  awesome . 
  do n't we all ... 
  jumbo . 
  fuck albert heijn . 
  apart from the royal family who are generally respected , albeit begrudgingly by some , most other celebrities , when they are popular with one demographic , are pretty much either ignored or reviled by the rest of the population . 
  we admitted we 're a tax haven , apparently , and the judge upheld the decision that the state can be held responsible for the deaths of 3 bosniaks during the srebrenica snafu . 
  also in the news : it 's almost time for the yearly government budget so big words and arguments left and right about how stupid the other side is . 
  yay . 
   airports getting closed and what-not wat i believe there are a few tiny regional airports that operate in the summer season for charter flights to holiday destinations , but if you 're booking regular flights you wo n't even go to these airports . 
  why bother `` fighting back '' ? 
  about a third of this is true and actual things we should be ashamed of , another third is extreme hyperbole or irrelevant , and a third is the pot calling the kettle black . 
  and then of course there 's the glaring absence of things that are not convenient for the us in this rant . 
  i should have clarified '' ... does not * exclusively * mean ` from the netherlands ' ... '' which is why it would be a very clever thing for william to say . 
  he identifies as `` deutsch '' , which is technically correct ( the best kind of correct ) , and in the low countries this word has a connotation of familiarity to it . 
  in holland it even meant `` goed hollandsch , goed rond , flink , vroolijk '' . 
  how positive !, 
  what a great guy !, 
  in the end , the song was n't written by william himself , but by his assistant , who was a writer and a diplomat . 
  the word `` duits '' was an excellent choice . 
   in general , as a scientific-minded person i 'm not a fan of the method of putting yourself in their shoes . 
  you 're absolutely right , it 's not very scientifically sound . 
  it 's fun though , and as long as the premises are right you can play with it . 
  picture this : i 'm loafing about being a minor dignitary in gorinchem or some place , and a dude with a funny accent comes up to me and says * `` ick binne wilhelm , ick comme aut nassau , end ick binne deutsch . 
  '' * ( i do n't know what rhine-franconian sounds like , bear with me ) now i can understand what this guy is saying , ( although i have to concentrate because he sounds pretty funny ) and he tells me he is `` deutsch '' . 
  now since there 's no place called `` deutschland '' yet , i can safely translate what he 's saying to that he 's * duits * , meaning `` dutch '' , which , by the way , does * not * yet mean `` from the netherlands '' . 
  this guy is allright !, 
  he 's dutch/duits/deutsch , not one of those stinking frenchies or spanish !, 
  he 's one of us !, 
  which is exactly the most important message william of orange-nassau would want to convey to the people when he became stadhouder of holland . 
  got my besiegers and besieged mixed up !, 
  i do n't * really * know what i 'm talking about . 
  i 'm not a linguist or historian , but a philosopher ( as in i studied philosophy ) , which means i always risk the possibility of being wonderfully full of shit . 
  as such though , i take a broad interest in a wide range of topics ( as do good philosophers ) , and history and language are among my favourite . 
  i find it interesting to imagine how thoughts about the self and the identity reflected in language through the ages and in different contexts . 
  i mean , * really * put myself in the shoes of the person who was speaking , or hearing this , and * feeling * what it meant to them as a person . 
  making an effort to disconnect myself from what it means to * me * . 
  i do n't have any sources handy , other than what you probably already googled yourself : - https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/advies/ben-ik-van-dietsen-bloed - https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/advies/dutch it 's pretty interesting to note , though , that willem himself , aside from french and latin , would have spoken rhine-franconian ( he was from dillenburg after all ) , a [ franconian language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franconian_languages ) related to low-franconian , aka dutch , which he would also have no trouble with . 
  speaking to his troops/allies/subjects he would refer to himself as `` duits '' ( or whatever the translation of * duits * was in rhine-franconian ) , and translated into any other regional dialect it would have still meant `` one of us '' . 
  sounds cool . 
  i 'm all for it ; message the mods !, 
  i think we 're pretty much on the same page here , but i wanted to clarify a bit as to the context of the word in the 16th century : there was no `` germany '' back then , nor had the concept of a `` netherlands '' as a united people really taken hold yet . 
  what we were , was a continuum of germanic speaking people stretching from east germany to the north sea , divided into counties , duchies , bishoprics , provinces and other small administrative divisions , and all these people would refer to themselves , collectively , in their native language , as some variation of the word `` duits '' . 
  it did n't mean * `` dutch '' as opposed to `` german '' * because the distinction * did n't exist yet * . 
  he 's from nassau ! '', 
  - `` oh , then i guess he 's ok ; he 's * one of us * , he 's * dutch/duits/deutsch / diets / ( whatever you called it in your local dialect ) * '', 
  right , what i mean is that all the people living in the aforementioned lands at the time would have used some variation of the word ` duits ' to refer to themselves , their own people . 
  i think , very loosely , it has the connotation of the word `` us '' . 
  the dutch national anthem uses the melody of a french catholic soldiers ' song about besieging a city full of protestants . 
  you can not ignore my girt, 
   actually at the time of writing duits could have referred to dutch as well as german . 
  almost . 
  the word `` duits '' , `` deutsch '' or `` dutch '' all have the same root and simply mean `` the people '' . 
  the term roughly refers to all of the peoples living between the oder , the north sea , and the alps . 
  i clicked the link and suddenly got the urge to put a camera on my car 's dashboard . 
  the `` being of german blood '' part was n't so strange , since he was indeed from nassau , in present-day germany , and the dutch provinces and the german duchies , counties , and whatnot were all part of the holy roman empire anyway . 
  the line about the king of spain was to signify that he had no beef with the king of spain , only with the king 's proxy who was sent to govern over the dutch provinces . 
  i did not know that . 
  wow , it sounds very desperate . 
  ha , you better not let any swedes catch you saying that !, 
  you 'll never live it down !, 
  but i agree , it 's quite beautiful . 
  i never realized `` deutschland \u00fcber alles '' were n't the original lyrics to this song !, 
  that 's actually really beautiful . 
  interesting . 
  do you have a link to the actual song being played with lyrics ? 
  your food is better in general . 
  you 're also more polite and have better grammar . 
  is there any other decade we could have built such a monstrosity in ? 
  that 's the shape of the shopping mall/station complex hoog catherijne . 
  the original train station is n't even there any more . 
  already was . 
  omg !,
