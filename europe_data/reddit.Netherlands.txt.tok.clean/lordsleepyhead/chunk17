  some of the simpsons production staff is in south korea . 
  that 's the netherlands for you : not very good at bread , excellent at dairy . 
  this is subjective as hell of course , but here are my favourite three : - [ alfred j. kwak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfred_j._kwak ) - [ keek op de week ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/keek_op_de_week ) ^ sorry , ^ dutch ^ wiki ^ page ^ only ^ :( - [ beagle : in het kielzog van darwin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beagle:_in_darwin%27s_wake ) we also invented reality tv as it exists today . 
  sorry world . 
   on italians -- `` - what do you call an italian with his hands in his pocket ? '' `` - a mute '' i heard a variation of this joke :  `` how do you get an italian to shut up ? '', 
  - `` you tie his hands behind his back . '', 
   `` you mean those filthy , scheming , theiving pencil stealing * terrorists !, 
  * '' ftfy there , now i brought the nsa into this thread . 
  in amsterdam , it would have been a feat if you 'd arrived at something * other * than albert heijn . 
  damn near impossible . 
  but look at how cute they are !, 
  i fucking love those little hat-men in berlin !, 
  i 'd very much like to have them here . 
  this has been posted to death in other subs , but i think you may [ need the lesson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee_iupineuc ) . 
   i always through holland = the netherlands still ? 
  i am disappointed in you , neighbour from across the water . 
   somehow everyone around the world seems to make fun of the dutch language . 
  we have the second silliest accent in europe , after the french . 
  it is a proven scientific fact . 
  source : that reddit survey from a while ago, 
  it 's not so much that it 's a good one . 
  it 's just the most well-known dutch beer abroad . 
  they have a very successful marketing strategy . 
  i think literally every country or city or even neighbourhood has their own version of this joke . 
  keeping up appearances is shit . 
  * good * british comedy shows are : monty python , fawlty towers , blackadder , a bit of fry and laurie , absolutely fabulous , only fools and horses , the young ones , the vicar of dibley , dad 's army , red dwarf , the office , the thin blue line , black books , little britain ... * bad * british comedy shows are : benny hill , are you being served , ` allo ` allo , bottom ... 
  heineken is looked down upon by many dutch though . 
  we find it weak and bland . 
  no , the brits know the difference . 
  it 's more to do with netherlands being a much smaller country than the uk so the comparison is less obvious . 
  being drunk makes you careless . 
  being stoned makes you paranoid . 
  `` the problem with poor americans is that they do n't see themselves as poor , but rather temporarily embarrassed millionaires . '', 
  - john steinbeck, 
  as usual , ignoring the dutch . 
  i 'm half dutch , half english , have lived in both countries , and can assure you that the english have more in common with the dutch than with the germans . 
  in fact , we are frightfully similar . 
  albert heijn . 
  holy shit that store is everywhere . 
  be prepared to run into a wall of bureaucracy , discrimination and prejudice . 
  europe is good to europeans . 
  outsiders , not so much . 
  i 'd guess slavic is the largest group , what with russia and all . 
  we have this one with a dutchman , a german and a belgian . 
  also that we stay in the left lane forever , holding up traffic . 
  i 'm surprised the germans have this stereotype though . 
  i thought we all went to france with our caravans . 
   but that joke is not based on a stereotype ... 
  i think it 's probably a leftover from the war , where dutch people would always try to screw the germans in some way or another , as a form of `` resistance , '' even though most acts of `` resistance '' were actually silly or ineffective . 
  [ this comedy duo did a short film about this back in 1985 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x67rym66tbs ) . 
  it 's a fake documentary about two brothers who go to their garden allotment during the liberation day celebration , and keep going on about the older brother 's `` act of resistance '' during german occupation . 
  apparently , when he was a 14 year old during the war , when a german had asked him for directions to the train station , he had pointed him in the wrong direction :  * `` wo ist der bahnhof ? 
  '' * it 's these tiny acts of questionable `` resistance '' old people like to brag about , that have become a running gag in the netherlands . 
  any misleading act , that in actuality does n't exceed the scope of your typical innocent high school prank , becomes a `` heroic act of resistance '' in the context of nazi occupation . 
  the film also pokes fun at the dutch old people 's massive blind spot for how large parts of society actually collaborated with the nazis . 
  the two brothers talk about their dad like he 's some kind of resistance hero , but if you listen carefully the picture emerges that the man was actually a huge nazi collaborator scumbag . 
  he 's not the person i want to take this `` point '' from . 
  first , the government he belongs to does everything in its power to fuck up the economy and worsen unemployment and labour laws , and then he turns around and starts sounding the alarm about eastern europeans coming in and working for less than a dutch living wage , under lax labour laws and deregulation that * his * government made happen . 
  well , fuck him . 
  ha , you 're right !, 
  but who needs a male line right ? 
  that 's just sexist anyway , 
  he 's a direct descendent of william the silent so it 's all good . 
  tell me a dutch joke !, 
  i 'll tell you a german joke : a dutch guy is walking along the canal in amsterdam . 
  he sees a guy scooping water out of the canal with one hand and drinking it . 
  he walks up to the guy , and says `` you should n't drink canal water , you 'll get sick ! '', 
  the guy responds `` was sagst du ? '', 
  lodewijk ascher is * not * `` level-headed '', 
  it 's almost budget time for the cabinet so they 're trying to create a distraction by shouting that * them foreigners tuk er jerrbs !, 
  fuck off russia , nobody likes you . 
  fucking brilliant !, 
  you 'd make an outstanding eu bureaucrat !, 
  they are responsible for all the common sense labour laws we take for granted nowadays : minimum wages , protection against unfair layoffs , safety in the workplace , sick leave , abolition of child labour , no forced unpaid overtime , etc etc. 
  they did this by organizing as a group for increased bargaining power , sometimes using methods like strikes or blockades when bargaining fails . 
  yet these days , many people tend to view them negatively , due to their sometimes disruptive effects on public services or seemingly stubborn , inflexible nature . 
  also because of how corporate media likes to portray them . 
  yeah , same here . 
  in fact , it 's policy to add more trees whenever possible . 
  wow , that is so useful . 
  i hope you realize i was making a joke . 
  why , i like everything about france , of course , except that it 's full of french people . 
  ** netherlands ** - we buried a dead prince - austerity - minister complains about eastern europeans who * tuk er jerrbs !, 
  * - everybody thinks the government is handing the recession wrong except the government, 
  i think maybe tuscany or catalonia , though i 'm pretty content where i am tbh . 
  i 'm sorry , this article is horribly written . 
  as long as we get frickin ' sharks to put these frickin ' lasers on their heads it 's fine by me . 
  i think you 'll find plenty of `` lads '' getting shitfaced in amsterdam , but indeed , it 's not just the `` lads '' . 
  they come from many places . 
  i think it 's not so much a single country or countries , but that there is a single monetary policy being applied to many different economies who are all struggling for very different reasons . 
  and here i am , getting my hopes up ... :(, 
  well obviously that 's just not feasible in a lot of cases . 
  besides , sticking to the speed limit is better for the economy : less carbon emissions , smoother flow of traffic , less stressed out people who call in sick or people who get into accidents . 
  sticking to the speed limit is just common sense . 
  does this mean all those loud and obnoxious drunk twenty-something weed tourists will fuck off to albania instead ? 
  i vote * yea *, 
  maybe so , but the point i was making is that discrimination does n't always stem from racism . 
  in this particular case , it was discrimination on religious grounds . 
  it 's not racism , it 's discrimination . 
  but yeah , it 's pretty sad .
