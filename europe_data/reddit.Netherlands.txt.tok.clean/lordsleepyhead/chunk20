  it 's obvious why those would carry over but the other terms would n't . 
  greetings from cannabis !, 
  the word * snip * for a fl .100 , - note simply came from the fact that for a time , it featured a picture of a [ snipe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_snipe ) . 
  the other slang word , * meier * , comes from the hebrew * mei'oh * ; `` hundred '' . 
  bulgaria ? 
  that is indeed a lovely word . 
  but i can do you one better . 
  i bet you never heard this word before : http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/achenebbisj read more : http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/achenebbisj, 
  indeed it is !, 
  i forgot about that one !, 
  actually , a lot of slang for money comes from the dutch slang language called * bargoens * , which was a mixture of dutch , german , yiddisch , hebrew , and roma languages and was spoken by criminals and beggars as a sort of `` secret code language '' to avoid eavesdropping police from understanding them . 
  many other now common dutch words come from * bargoens * too : * bajes * = prison ( proper dutch : gevangenis ) , * gabber * = friend or pal ( proper dutch : vriend ) , * jatten * = stealing ( proper dutch : stelen ) , * smeris * = policeman ( proper dutch : politieagent ) , * gozer * = young man ( proper dutch : jongeman ) ... ... * hufter , penoze , temeier , saffie , doerak , nor , juut , snikkel , trut , naatje , prammen , jottem , * etc etc. . . 
  never heard that one either . 
  i 'm guessing this one is because a lot of idiots can not into greek ? 
  never heard that one before . 
  countries with multi-party systems do it all the fucking time . 
  does n't bother me in the slightest . 
  people all over the world lump other groups of people who live far away together in broad categories ; how often do you not hear people talk about the people in `` the far east '' , `` the arabs '' , or `` the africans '' ? 
  it 's just what people do . 
  what does annoy me is how some brits will talk in terms of `` the uk '' versus `` the continent '' , as if you 're so different , or something special , and all of us are in `` that other thing , over there '' . 
  as a dutchman , you and me are pretty much indistinguishable , from say , a romanian 's point of view . 
  stop acting like you 're not europe . 
  unfortunately , the introduction of the euro was the death of all our wonderful money slang ( the 5 cent coin was called a * stuiver * ; the 10 cent coin was a * dubbetje * ; 25 cents was * kwartje * or * heitje * , 1 guilder = * piek * or * pop * or * pegel * ; the 2,50 coin was called a * riks * or a * knaak * ; a 10 guilder note was a * joetje * , a 25 guilder note was a * geeltje * ; a 100 guilder note was a * meier * or a * snip * ; a 250 guilder note was a * vuurtoren * and a 1000 guilder note was a * rug * or * rooie rug * ) we lost all that , unfortunately . 
  we did , however , keep the slang words for money in general , such as * poen * , * doekoe * , * flappen * , * pegels * and * duiten * some annoying pseudo-posh college douchebags , however , will refer to more than one euro as * euri *, 
  this actually says more about the press in italy than about the people . 
  yeah , ` secretly ' ... 
  estonia wants into nordic but his buddies wo n't let him :(, 
  give us our weather back , finland !, 
   most supermarkets in the netherlands do n't look like this in my experience . 
  you 've never been to a jumbo ? 
  that was absolutely magnificent !, 
  such is life ... 
  it 's funny they would call him `` metropolitan '' and `` out of touch '' in the same sentence , considering the vast majority of uk residents live in cities . 
  you have to buy us dinner first ... 
  i kinda like it . 
  it has an interesting and unusual chord progression , dark and enigmatic lyrics and the way she sings it is sharp and chilling . 
  refreshing change of pace from all the major-key happy-happy formulaic shitstains we sent to all the previous editions . 
  huh , surprisingly low for the netherlands . 
  i thought we were doing really well in this case . 
  i 'm wondering what the remaining inequalities are that make this figure so low ? 
  i 'll catch it on the news when it 's over . 
  i 'm just glad my country 's entry is n't an embarrassing piece of crap this year . 
  too many years we sent complete fools to the contest . 
  it 's no secret that welfare systems are exploitable . 
  ever since its conception , it 's been a cat-and-mouse game between the government and the potential exploiters . 
  and it 's not bulgaria 's and romania 's problem . 
  it just happens , this time , some bulgarian and romanian criminal organisations are doing this . 
  in the netherlands , the scandal is not that they do this . 
  that 's hardly a surprise . 
  the scandal is that apparently it 's been going on for a long time and the responsible deputy minister did n't do anything about it . 
  so we 're not mad at eastern europe . 
  we 're mad at criminals and our own government . 
  [ everyone 's a little bit racist ] ( http://youtu.be/rxnm1uhhsoi ), 
  i think we used them for about 5 seconds after they were introduced and then we just went `` fuck this shit , we 're not using this tiny money any more '' and now we just round up or down to the nearest 0 or 5, 
  that 's pretty fucked up . 
  i 'm sorry have i personally offended you in a different thread or something ? 
  i did n't even know europe day existed . 
  these brussels politicians are really not trying at all to sell the idea of the eu to us . 
   some czechs and slovaks feel nostalgic about it as i understand it , many citizens from central and eastern europe feel a sort of nostalgia for the protection and community spirit the old regimes offered . 
  like , they may have been poor and lacking freedom , at least the people cared about eachother and there was more equality . 
  something like that , is what it seems like at least , from an outside perspective . 
  so mostly nostalgia . 
  wo n't ever happen . 
  at least not in the way this conservative dickwad wants . 
  i see them . 
  i see them looking around , wondering if we think they 're doing something wrong . 
  watching their step , trying to look ` normal ' and ` harmless ' . 
  sometimes our eyes lock and i can see them thinking , `` i 'm sorry '' and i think , `` no , * i 'm * sorry . '', 
  nobody needs to be sorry . 
  well , that 's one thing we 've got . 
  i think i remember the film . 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 are you fucking kidding me , eu ? 
   did n't the netherlands recently reject a new round of austerity ? 
  ugh , we do n't know * what * we 're doing at the moment . 
  austerity on the right , investments on the left . 
  that 's what you get when you get a left-right coalition government . 
  shit 's confusing , yo . 
  love you too , bro . 
  you mean alsace-lorraine ? 
  if you get too carried away with your natural resources you end up contracting [ dutch disease ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_disease ) it 's like diabetes for countries . 
  the economy is shit so voter mood swings are happening all over europe . 
  we just had a spell of right wing frenzy ourselves . 
  i ai n't even mad any more . 
  it 's pretty much split 50-50 here . 
  despite being a `` donor '' country , there 's a large portion of our population that demands that we should be growing other euro countries ' economies as well as our own . 
  they are our largest market after all . 
  plus , it 's just the right thing to do . 
  germany , the netherlands , and belgium have always been the biggest proponents of european unification , and now the single market is affecting certain regions negatively , we ca n't simply stand back and let 'em stew . 
  right-wing media in our country try to portray southern european countries as lazy and wasteful . 
  i think that 's biased and unfair towards the citizens over there . 
  i think the more pressing issue is corruption ; money intended for growth and stability not reaching the people and businesses who need it , but instead ending up in politicians ' , and their little circle of business partner 's pockets . 
  i think our biggest concern should be stability for the people through employment and properly functioning social safety nets . 
  well , that 's just like , your opinion , man . 
  the german commander announced the capitulation on the 4th , but stated it would be effective starting the next day . 
  have fun . 
  off to groningen myself . 
  merkel is becoming more and more isolated as the proponent of austerity . 
  it 's only a matter of time before the proponents of growth models get the upper hand . 
  * the new king - queen beatrix abdicates after being head of state for 33 years ; willem-alexander takes the throne ; the whole day goes off without a hitch and is very festive * rememberance day - the dutch remember the people who died in the ww2 and beyond ; a small debate erupts about whether or not it is okay to remember the german soldiers who died here too * liberation day - every provincial capital has its own festivities , which include live music , theatre , debates , and lots of alcoholic beverages * massive tax fraud loophole discovered linked with bulgarian gangs ; responsible deputy minister claims he did n't know about it , evidence suggests otherwise * ruling labour party deeply divided over the status of illegal aliens ; cabinet wants a strict approach , party members want a more humane approach, 
  i 'm thinking it * might * be a good idea to have rich foreigners buy abandoned villages * if * they are able to breathe life back into the area , while treating the culture and landscape respectfully .
