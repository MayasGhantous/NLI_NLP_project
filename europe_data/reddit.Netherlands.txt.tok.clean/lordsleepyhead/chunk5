  ireland stronk !, 
  even most european muslims think isis is creepy as fuck and batshit insane . 
  but , to answer your question : i do n't know as long as i do n't know what the plan is . 
  i 'd say the attitude towards germany is generally positive . 
  i think it 's a tough one . 
  i really ca n't decide whether i favour germany or belgium . 
  does the uk count as a neighbour ? 
  if so , i think the uk is maybe * slightly * less favourable . 
  which is funny because i 'm originally from there . 
  the point of a tram is that it * can * share space with other traffic in dense inner-city areas , but where space permits , you can have it run on a grassy median like in this photo . 
  it looks nicer and also muffles the tram 's rumble a bit . 
  most cities have a combination of shared space stretches and dedicated stretches . 
  i guess i 'll have to add that to my ever-growing list of places i want to visit but probably wo n't , 
  i have n't been to the anne frank house since i was 10 years old . 
  this was in 1988 . 
  these days , the queue in front is absolutely insane . 
  peles castle is absolutely gorgeous !, 
  this thread is about trams , not metros  but yes , there is a new metro in the netherlands . 
  it 's the [ alstom metropolis ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/gvb_metro_m5%2c_station_lelylaan.jpg ) and it was ordered for usage on amsterdam 's new north-south line ( still under construction ) , which will be line number 52 . 
  at the moment , the trains that have already been delivered are servicing the ring line and the east line . 
  i like that the pantograph is red as well . 
  great post !, 
  i especially like the szczecin tram design . 
  it seems like former eastern-bloc countries have held on to their trams much more often than their western european counterparts . 
  over here , after wwii there was this belief that everyone would become rich and own a car , and trams were ripped out of cities everywhere . 
  of course that only led to congestion , traffic deaths and pollution so now you see the reverse trend where every self-respecting city wants a tram again , except this shit has gotten massively expensive so many cities ca n't afford it . 
  such a shame . 
  so colourful !, 
  this is hardly surprising any more , is it ? 
   and yes , islam is an intolerant , backward , stone-age cult . 
  the stone age was long over before any of the abrahamic religions were founded . 
  also , islam is the youngest of the big 3 . 
  a lot of cities play around with the concept of trams , trying to make them more up-to-date and efficient . 
  utrecht and amsterdam have the `` sneltram '' ( quick tram ) which is a high-floor tram with long stretches of separated track and high platforms . 
  in amsterdam the sneltram is even capable of sharing the metro tunnels . 
  brussels and antwerp have the `` premetro '' , in which trams run through stretches of tunnels under the city , which may later be converted into proper metro tunnels . 
  excellent post !, 
  much appreciated . 
  first of all , if you may remember , this conflict has been going on since way before mh17 , and so has the sanctions-war . 
  i 'm sure you recall the `` referendum '' in crimea and the mysteriously well-armed `` civil guard '' that appeared on the streets of simferopol to `` oversee '' the process ? 
  the conflict in ukraine has had `` russia '' written all over it since the very beginning . 
  second , each successive round of sanctions is targeted specifically at those closest to putin , in the hopes that he will lose support within the tight-knit circle of oligarchs that help him maintain power . 
  if anything is going to trash their economy , it will be these , russia 's retaliatory sanctions that , while indeed somewhat hurting eu companies , will actually wreak havoc with consumer prices in russia itself . 
  on the part of the `` who 's to blame for mh17 '' thing , you are absolutely right . 
  the sanctions , however , are a different story : eu+us sanctions on russia are targeted at the oligarchs , the state-run companies and the financial institutions that handle their money . 
  the sanctions in op 's pic refer to bans on imports by the russian quality watchdog on eu products . 
  so the eu+us sanctions are hurting the russian upper class , while the russian sanctions , in retaliation , are hurting their own lower and middle class . 
  lol , that 's brilliant !, 
  utrecht [ has those too ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/qbuzz_4203_utrecht_europalaan_2014.jpg ) ( and they also have a [ tram ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/qbuzz_5022_als_u-tram%2c_jaarbeursplein.jpg ) , which , since op is a bundle of sticks , is n't in the gallery ), 
  oddly shaped driver 's cabin . 
  you do n't see that often . 
  they are the trams of classic bond movies . 
  this should be in / r/noshitsherlock, 
  probably . 
  i remember when amsterdam-groningen was still being serviced by icm . 
  during busy parts of the day it was impossible to find a seat . 
  not only were people standing on the balconies , but they were shoulder-to-shoulder along the aisles as well . 
  i 'm glad they switched to virm for that line . 
  why not / r/trams ? 
  yeah , france does n't fuck around . 
  iirc antoni gaudi was killed by a tram . 
  i like the double-decker one with the open top floor . 
  really ? 
  are people still able to find a seat ? 
  yeah , op missed a huge number of tram cities . 
  looks like once again , op is a bundle of sticks . 
  part of it is . 
  yeah , sorry about that italobros . 
  personally , i would like our country to take on more of that responsibility , but our centre-right government chooses instead to pretend the problem does n't exist . 
  meh , is that really famous as a church though ? 
  i 'd say it 's mostly the tower that 's famous . 
  maybe , as a famous church as a whole , the st. bavo in haarlem or the st. jan in 's hertogenbosch ? 
  and , off the top of my head , nancy and mulhouse as well . 
  and there 's probably many more cities with trams in france too . 
  edit : [ yep . 
  many more tram cities in france ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trams_in_france#current_tramway_systems ), 
  yeah . 
  i like this `` x in europe '' series , but this one is lacking * a lot * of tram cities . 
  while we have some nice churches in the netherlands , i do n't actually think any one of them is the * most famous * . 
  no , those are older than virm . 
  they 're refurbished dd-ar from the early 90s , now called ddz . 
  this album is missing quite a few cities . 
  do you take the intercity from almere to zwolle ? 
  cause that has free wifi . 
  well , eastern european countries have been getting hit with random russian sanctions for quite some time now . 
  every time a former soviet-bloc country even so much as glances in the direction of brussels , russia mysteriously finds something wrong in one of their agricultural exports and promptly bans them . 
  this time , though , it is indeed our fault lithuania is getting hit so badly . 
  so we better step up and do what 's right . 
  weird . 
  may be one of the last intercity trains to not have wifi then . 
  you 're unlucky :(, 
  well i hope you 're not implying we should just say `` fuck lithuania , let 'em rot '' ? 
  what ? 
  all trains i 've been in had free wifi ? 
  which trains do you use ? 
  ok so if the eu member states do n't show solidarity to lithuania during all this then we have failed the european project . 
  i kinda like it . 
  it has a rugged soviet aesthetic . 
  yeah no . 
  we do n't demolish trains that easily here in the netherlands .
