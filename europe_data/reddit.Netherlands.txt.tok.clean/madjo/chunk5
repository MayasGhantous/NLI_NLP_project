  so i would n't at all be surprised if it 's not held to the same standard as the german text on this thing . 
  it seems rather more accidentally correct than intentionally . 
  not = emergency hahn = cock as in rooster . 
  ( other meanings of hahn are tap and faucet and of course valve ), 
  ` and a wizard 's staff has a knob on the end . ', 
  hahn = cock as in rooster , right ? 
  i started to wonder how they 'd do this in baarle-nassau/baarle-hertog , then i realized that there 's not language barrier there . 
  she just rolls her eyes when he talks with her . 
  yes it 's celebrated every year , but only an official holiday ( as in officially a day off ) every 5 years . 
  yes and no . . 
  in the case of for instance christmas , you can be sure that most of your family ( if they do not work in a service-related field ) will be free off work too , and make it easier to meet up . 
  otherwise you 'd have to set a date somewhere , and it 's a hassle to get everyone 's schedules lined up . 
  so , those 7 public holidays are in a way a godsend . 
  on the other hand , why do we have a public holiday on ascension day ? 
  i 'm not religious ( for that matter easter and pentecost are pretty ridiculous too , and technically you could count christmas there as well , but most people i know celebrate it , even though they 're not religious anymore , it 's not so much the birth of christ that gets celebrated but rather the togetherness and the midwinter-feast that it 's originally supposed to be . ), 
  i do n't mind having a free day off ( one that is n't deducted from the annual amount of hours that we get ), 
  til . . 
  i do n't follow the news about it . 
   in that case , no idea why we do n't get a day off every year . 
  not quite sure the reasoning , other than you have nice round numbers in years , every year ending in 5 and 0 . 
  but on those special years they do go all out with festivals around the nation and a few big acts being flown from location to location . 
  we only have 7 public holidays ? 
  new yearsday , good friday , easter monday , king day , liberation day ( once every 5 years ) , ascension day , pentecost monday , first christmas day , second christmas day . 
  i count 8 or 9 . 
  \\* edit * oh i just found out that good friday is n't an official holiday . 
  and the map maker did n't count liberation day , as the next one wo n't happen until 2020 . 
  so indeed , 7 . 
  too expensive , for sure . 
  i 'm sure they can make their own high quality domestic paint thinner . 
  do n't go to finland if you want to keep drinking alcohol .

  yeah but them * insert people from neighbouring nation * are weird , unlike us , we 're completely normal !, 
  my head hurts . 
  am i spanish , german , french , dutch and kenyan , at the same time ? 
  let 's just get rid of borders altogether . 
  are you pondering what i 'm pondering , cameron ? 
  i think so , may , but where are we going to find a dead pig at this time of night ? 
  we will not go quietly into the night !, 
  we will not vanish without a fight !, 
  we 're going to live on !, 
  we 're going to survive !, 
  vive la france !, 
  please clap . 
  seven points for germany ... sept points pour allemagne . 
  great band though, 
  there are more countries with royals than just sweden . 
  for instance great britain , which i assume is the reason for the quotes . 
  our monarch has almost no power left . 
  it 's mostly symbolic in nature . 
  i may not always agree with royalty , but i sure as hell do not want a president . 
  wait ... you gave an argument against the monarchy ? 
  i must have missed that in your one line post . 
  `` is bad joke '' is not an argument . 
  the looking around , i 'm guilty of that too . 
  but i do wish we would incorporate the british way of queueing more often . 
  some mediamarkts have started to use them ( the one in eindhoven certainly does ) but most other shops ... by gum , it drives me insane , having to choose which line to take only to see that the line at cash register 2 goes twice as fast etc. 
  why have one queue that moves relatively quickly , when you can have 5 that do n't move at all ? 
  yes but my point is that my google search for `` syria false flag chemical attack '' only gave me those types of websites and not nyt or wapo , or other more mainstream news sites . 
  my initial post was removed , here is the url ( but altered ) www breitbart com / national-security/2017/04 / 11/putin-syria-chemical - attack-was-false-flag-more-provocations-are-coming /, 
  i agree that it was probably a smart move . 
  i 'm not sure about the long term strategy and the us would be wise to not remain too trigger happy in that ( very unstable ) region , but it probably was a smart move . 
  i disagree with the rest of your statement . 
  obama was plenty criticized for his actions abroad , with the exception of him getting osama bin laden . 
  btw , it 's putin that 's saying that the chemical attack was a false flag . 
  most credible news sources are n't calling it a false flag . 
  politifact even said that that claim is unproven : http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/apr/07/unproven-online-theories-doubting-syrian-gas-attac/ it 's infowars , breitbart and russia today that are calling it a false flag . 
  not exactly news sources i 'd put a lot of trust in . 
  which ones ? 
  honestly curious . 
  `` trump did nothing wrong . '', 
  triggered yet ? 
  according to the daily mail , the sun causes cancer . 
  so , i hope you used protection when you looked at it . 
  i do n't believe that , sure the french do have a lot of vacation time , but , surely , no bank would close for an entire month , especially in a tourist 's village like paris . 
  welcome to the netherlands , land of possibilities . 
  i think the russians have all of you beat . 
  that 's the one i picked too !, 
  early ** 30s ** , ** full time working ** heterosexual male atheist jedi , from western/northern europe , here . 
  one point of contention with the survey ... downloading copyrighted material is for the most part legal in my country . 
  so `` downloading illegal material '' is a bit of a misnomer for me , but i understood the intention of the question . 
  i would n't call criticism on the israeli state ` antisemitism ' . 
  i still support the jewish people , it 's just the israeli government that i do n't agree with . 
  this is my view as well ( dutch ) . 
  enough tourists to help you brake , ie bump into . 
  especially around amsterdam . 
  never knew that michigan had that many tall / r/trees . 
  i guess i avoided our news broadcasts a bit too much . 
   have n't seen a nos journaal in weeks . 
  you can get one at many petrol stations for a euro or so . 
  this is news to me . 
  i 'll have to look into my tomtom to see if i can turn off the already very paranoid speed camera warning system . 
  ( it 's not live updated , so it uses a pre existing speed camera database , and it warns about a possible speed camera about every 2 kilometers . ), 
  according to this site : https://happeningo.com/the-europe-song/ there are 12 words in the song . 
  they 're all made up . 
  so to answer your question , probably none . 
  btw thank you for housing sinterklaas for us during the months when we do n't need him . 
  excuse my klatchian ... 
  i do n't think we say something like that in dutch . 
  and erdogan , too . 
  if she really thinks it 's going to stop terrorism , she 's woefully inept and stupid as a brick .
