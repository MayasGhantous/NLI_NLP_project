  in places like berlin or munich or frankurt it might take even a month . 
  where do you get flats to house them in ? 
  or do you just keep building them , so you always have some empty spares for when the need arises ? 
  and why would anyone be homeless if they can get homes ? 
   in practice , in overburdened offices they do n't bother much with this part , they just do the payment , either directly or hand you the money . 
  does n't that get exploited enormously ? 
  hell , we have to have year-long waiting lists and background checks for the food banks , otherwise everyone 'd park their mercedes around the corner and abscond with the food and there 'd be none left for the actual poor . 
  in an overburdened office in the netherlands ( of whatever kind ) they 'd likely just throw your application in the trash to be rid of it and mark it as completed . 
  they 'd certainly not get to spend extra money on you because they were overworked and said `` well , this way it 'll be handled in time and it 'll be at least enough even if it might cost us some extra '' . 
   chinese people should have a higher acceptance rate than fucking tunisia why ? 
  i could understand if they are falun gong members or democracy activists or something , but the vast , vast majority of chinese are n't , and otherwise china is stable and safe and not even that poor anymore . 
  and having said that , the democracy activists are unlikely to flee , they 're so driven to improve their country that they will spit in the face of the dictatorship , they 're not people who will move to europe for their own comfort and leave everyone else under the dictatorship . 
  if they had that mindset they 'd never have become activists in the first place . 
  it 's not . 
  they have free shelter when it is freezing , that 's all . 
  when it is not freezing you have to pay for the shelter too , about three bucks per night usually though that differs per city . 
  in fact , you ca n't even register for the waiting list for social housing if you 're homeless , because you need to have an official address to register . 
  you ca n't register for welfare either . 
  what you 're supposed to do is go to your family or friends and register at their address , and once you 've done that you 've found a couch to sleep on too . 
  then you register for welfare at that address ( it will be reduced because you 're living in a household with an income ) , and then you can register to wait for social housing , but the waiting list for that is several years at a minimum . 
  ideally of course , you start sending out resumes and find a job at this point but there 's a bit of a work scarcity at the moment . 
   glad to see germans still efficient at camp organisation apparently they 're not efficient at all , if it takes them over a week to figure out the difference between a tourist and an asylum seeker . 
  i wonder how long it would 've taken if it had been an arab tourist ( from dubai or something where people are n't fleeing ) . 
   including a flat , permanently really ? 
  is that just on paper with a 100-year waiting list or is that an actual real thing that happens , that homeless people can simply * get a home * if they just apply ? 
  but would you want them in your country ? 
  if a bunch of them showed up , would you grant them asylum ?

  * \\* bang \\* * shit , wrong wire ... *, 
  would n't it depend on what constitutes `` fighting for your country '' ? 
  most people i know would probably fight if there were an invasion right here , especially if the fight seems winnable , but i do n't know anyone who 'd go join the army to go conquer some oil in the middle east at the usa 's behest . 
  where would you go ? 
  if germany is fucked , europe is fucked , and outside of europe nobody takes refugees , especially not in the numbers you 'll get if europe really is fucked . 
  with the numbers for the netherlands and turkey , erdogan could probably pull a crimea on rotterdam and our government would probably accept it rather than send the army in and reconquer it . 
  especially if they could get a treaty about the harbour . 
  though maybe such an event would raise dutch interest in fighting . 
   an is contact man suggested to the 17-year-old that he drive a car into a mass of people . 
  the perpetrator rejected the suggestion , * justifying himself by saying he did n't have a driver 's license * . 
  instead , ahmadzai announced , he would board a train and attack the first passengers that are convenient . 
  killing people is fine , but to stoop so low as to break the traffic regulations , that 's unthinkable . 
  i do n't think so , black people ca n't swim !, 
  ( that 's an actual stereotype about black people that they have in the us ), 
   grod forbid they get their own brexit referendum . 
  the eu without germany would be like the ussr without russia at this point . 
  the whole thing would fall apart . 
  greenland actually left , over fishing rights iirc . 
  were those really free elections though ? 
  i heard he was only there so long because the russians wanted him , and he only left because he started going senile . 
   the us has one of the highest : 76.6 % of prisoners are re-arrested within five years . 
  the us also does n't really have any kind of social safety net , and nobody is willing to hire an ex-con . 
  you really do n't have much of a choice to go back to crime then . 
  he probably already looked like that . 
  i doubt he 's all there given how he * flew to china unannounced * . 
  and that he thought his online ` girlfriend ' was real to begin with . 
  i think he 's just the village idiot . 
  beijing seems to have managed just fine , and china has a reputation for shoddy quality . 
   `` see if it comes up , and if so , deal with it then '' it has already come up . 
  [ sometimes , people even have to go back to the very company that fired them . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/03/dwp-benefits-electrician-work-placement-labour ), 
  well , i guess we 've now figured out that it was corporate lobbyists who came up with this idea . 
  the problem is that with a scheme like this , the companies will fire their menial labour and then get them back via the government . 
  now the workers no longer get paid but still have to work , and the government ends up basically subsidizing the companies . 
  depends on the industry . 
  banking is about 10 % in the uk . 
  for us , yes . 
  hey , at least we do n't have to make up jokes anymore , we can just look at real life . 
  the pvv dislikes the amount of foreign influence over dutch society and wishes to reduce it . 
  similarly , denk dislikes the amount of dutch influence over dutch society and wishes to reduce it . 
  i do n't think they 've really thought it through . 
  the government of moldova once published a `` moldovan-romanian dictionary '' where almost all of the words were the same . 
  where there 's a will , there 's a way . 
  on the other hand , they were apparently only two men , armed only with knives . 
  they did n't have guns or explosives or anything . 
  they could n't have taken a crowd , even an unarmed crowd . 
  they still failed but `` at least '' they got the priest , which they would n't have managed otherwise . 
  make britain great again !, 
   the trend is towards increased trade , increased liberalization , increased connectivity . 
  they said the same just before ww1 . 
  by then , they will be the establishment parties , and the cycle will begin anew . 
  the turks here all have dual citizenship . 
  wait , why does albania need its magistrates to be appointed from the outside ? 
  that seems a very dangerous step to take , they 'll basically lose control over their judiciary . 
  the entitlement . 
  it boggles the mind . 
  if we put secular turks in with the turks we 've already got , we will have civil war . 
  nobody is going to kick turkey out of nato . 
  nato needs to hold on to the bosporus to stop the russians from getting into the mediterranean . 
  erdogan could get away with literal genocide and nato still would n't harm him . 
  ( however , if he tries to leave nato himself to ally with the russians instead , * then * he 's going to find himself on the business end of a `` grassroots '' `` democratic '' `` revolution '' . ), 
  i 'm becoming more and more convinced that most of today 's `` art '' is just one big subsidy scam . 
  belgium : at least it 's not baghdad !, 
  so when will the government come pull it down ? 
   the usa is a dysfunctional society you mean that country where they have race riots every week ? 
  are n't the people they hate white as well ? 
  at least here in the netherlands , you can get away with paying migrant workers from eastern europe according to the minimum wage in * their * country instead of here . 
  they also usually live on site , so you can `` make your money back '' by housing them in the cheapest , nastiest facilities you can find and then charging them rent through their noses for the privilege . 
  they also often do n't know what their rights are .
