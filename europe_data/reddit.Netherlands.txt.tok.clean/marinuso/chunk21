  is everybody who 's supposed to keep an eye on this just really corrupt ? 
  that 's the only explanation i can think of . 
  well , what 's a little bribe when his heart is so obviously in the right place ? 
   is it worth sacrificing everything for a utopian dream ? 
  or just compromise with an imperfect reality ? 
  you could say the same thing about keeping the eu , where the utopian dream is european integration , and the imperfect reality is that everyone has their own goals ( both on the individual and national level ) . 
   everything that can be used against trump will be used . 
  he seems quite immune to it , he gets away with everything . 
  ( i think the trick is simply not to apologize . ), 
  i wonder why this is being pushed so heavily all of a sudden . 
  it went from idiotic fantasy to serious proposal seemingly overnight . 
  [ in the usa , parents can get in trouble if they let their children walk around town by themselves . 
  ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/04/13/parents-investigated-letting-children-walk-alone/25700823/ ) which is , of course , considered ridiculous there as well , so that 's probably what he 's mocking . 
  whoever is not in power is in favour of democracy and free speech , because that creates an opening for them to gain power . 
  whoever * is * in power is against democracy and free speech , in actions if not always in words , because it creates an opening for others to gain power at their expense . 
   the us has always been interventionist only since world war 2 . 
   wonder if they were asleep or what the fire did happen at night . 
   nuclear launch program , is just a windows 95 pc , siting there [ believe it or not , it 's actually worse with the nukes , or at least it used to be . 
  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7097101.stm ), 
   one only needs to look at california to see how having lots of referenda can mess up public finances or frustrate the will of the people . 
  better public services ? 
  lower taxes ? 
  hell yeah , i 'll take that too !, 
  but switzerland does n't have this problem , so it 's not unavoidable . 
   finally , the wording of the questions at a referendum matters hugely , and who would be in charge of that ? 
  have representatives from both camps come to an agreement . 
   humanity collectively is n't capable of coming up with answers on it 's own -- it needs to be guided by a firm hand into the future . 
  that `` firm hand '' always belongs to someone who is just as human as the rest of us . 
  also , what future ? 
  we can choose our future . 
  not everyone wants to go where you want to take them . 
   but you 'll probably place them somewhere that voted fpo . 
  that 's usually how it works . 
  why not ? 
  what are they going to do , vote fpo ? 
  they 're voting fpo already . 
  it 's not like you 'll lose votes over it . 
  it makes perfect sense . 
  well , blondes are very easy to come by . 
  they 're just walking around on the streets undefended , you can just take one . 
  which is the exact attitude that has bred this whole problem . 
  nobody dares to touch them and they know it , is it any wonder that some of them start to act like it ? 
  it is n't even like all of them are like this . 
  there must be plenty of law-abiding moroccans who get tarred with the same brush . 
  if you want to `` help minorities '' this is * not * how you go about it . 
  this ridiculous policy hurts everyone , except the assholes . 
  if the police can stop right-wing assholes , they should also be capable of stopping moroccan assholes . 
  why do n't they ? 
  i agree that trying to bring in the identitarian resistance to deal with them is a cure that might well turn out worse than the disease , and in that sense it 's right that the police want to stop it , but none of this would ever have happened had the police just done their jobs in the first place . 
  if people are setting fire to cars , * arrest them * . 
  how hard can this possibly be ? 
  the government is n't unable to take action , it 's unwilling . 
  as you see , it is perfectly capable of taking action when it wants to . 
   their nato membership is going to be on thin ice . 
  some turks may think they are irreplacable , but nobody is . 
  nato is n't just about strength , it 's also about values . 
  no way in hell . 
  turkey controls the bosporus and the dardanelles . 
  that 's what keeps russia out of the mediterranean . 
  nato is not going to give that up . 
  they would happily ignore genocide if that is what it took . 
  they 're certainly not going to care about a few journalists . 
  on the other hand , if turkey were to try to leave of their own accord and ally with russia instead or something , nato would do quite a lot to stop that . 
  no doubt if erdogan tried something like * that * , he 'd suddenly wake up to a `` grassroots '' `` democratic '' `` revolution '' . 
  i do n't get how you can really admire hitler . 
  even the racists ought to hate him . 
  the man is a failure in every sense of the word . 
  he started a war and lost it . 
  on his watch , germany was bombed to bits and occupied by foreign powers . 
  germany was only reunited in 1990 and it 's still missing a quarter of its interwar territory . 
  and the war ended up killing so many germans that they had to import foreigners afterwards just so they 'd have enough workers . 
  hitler wanted a big , monoracial germany , and it is due to him that germany is the opposite of that today . 
  you 'd think the alt-right should hate him . 
  if he 'd gone to art school instead , germany would probably be closer to the alt-right ideal than it is now . 
   they 're the only people in europe that got in varietate concordia right . 
  the only thing that can ever really unite people is a common enemy . 
  yes , but you said ` the most popular ' . 
  the pvv is ahead of everyone else in [ the polls ] ( http://frontbencher.nl/peilingen/ ) , which makes them * the most * popular , at least if you trust the polls . 
  ( and if you do n't , then it 's completely meaningless to call anyone popular , since there 'd be no data . ), 
  and given that the pvv is indeed basically just wilders , that makes him more popular than all of groenlinks together . 
  since the other 3/4ths of the country are divided among at least 11 other parties . 
  it looks more than decent to me . 
  then again , i 'm dutch and over here pretty much every intersection and every little plot of grass has something like [ this ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:rotterdam_kunstwerk_gestileerde_bloem.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:rijnsweerdzuid1.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:sculpture_aarhuslaan-helsinkilaan_wentgebouw_utrecht_v1.jpg ) on it , so i might just be ruined . 
  he 's going to kick all of the whites out of london , all five of them . 
  if you wear a bnp t-shirt to school , surely that will get you into trouble ? 
  [ apparently you get handed into the police merely for looking at the ukip website ] ( http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/education/14304854.schoolboy_questioned_by_police__after_looking_at_ukip_website_/ ) , so i can only imagine what would happen if you actually and openly supported the * bnp * . 
  here in the netherlands , pupils have gotten into trouble for wearing dutch flag pins to school . 
  you 'd not get into official trouble for a hijab . 
  this does n't work . 
  not in the least because terrorists have been known to organize in the open on facebook . 
  there 's so much data to sift through that it 's pretty much impossible to actually find people even without encryption being used . 
  encryption backdoors obviously are n't going to solve this . 
  all this will do is hurt normal , law-abiding people by making their computers less safe . 
  anything the government can get at , hackers can also get at . 
  even if you trust the government and `` have nothing to hide '' this is still a huge problem . 
  just recently the cia lost control of a bunch of its hacking tools , and now every script kiddie can listen in on people via their smart tvs . 
  ( do n't buy a smart tv , people . ), 
  this is dangerous . 
  they 're from algeria , right ? 
  no way algeria is taking them back though .
