  it still makes some sense for china to do this . 
  they do n't have all that much coastline and they 're surrounded by the us navy and us allies and/or protectorates . 
  this way they have alternatives in case shit hits the fan . 
  see also [ this map ] ( http://japanfocus.org/data/scappaturapivot06.jpg ) . 
  if the malacca strait is blocked , they 're basically fucked . 
  and that 's * on top * of food and accomodation , it 's just spending money . 
  did n't all the other parties band together , so they need 51 % of the popular vote and form a non-coalition government ? 
   more like ic . 
  india is n't doing too well either . 
  half the kids are starving ( [ and that 's not even an exaggeration ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/10/child-malnutrition-india-national-shame ) ) , that 's not an economic power . 
  they make botswana look like switzerland . 
  and china is losing momentum pretty quickly . 
  so much for the brics . 
  is the power out again ? 
   and the `` rape '' `` gangs '' that are made of a `` specific ethnicity '' are also `` neonazi '' `` conspiracy theories '' . 
  well , to be fair , that was because of the police refusing to stop them . 
  any ethnicity will start committing more crimes if they can get away with more . 
  and there are white rape gangs too , for example the bbc and the house of lords . 
  i fucking hope not . 
  well , they do drink a lot . 
  i presume those are conservative arts students . 
  france is the way it is because of the people who live there . 
  of course every individual only plays a tiny part , but as a whole , the french have made and still make france . 
  you can not just say their living standards are unfairly high and should be lowered for the sake of others . 
  also remember that by this way of thinking , * your own * living standard is also unfairly high . 
  i can tell by the fact you speak english and have internet access . 
  are you willing to take a hit yourself ? 
  from each according to their ability , right ? 
  * can * you house a refugee ? 
  then , to each according to his need . 
   sure they will find out , but it takes way longer . 
  if they know they might be shadowbanned for the things they post , which everyone who posts `` controversial '' things will , they will most likely check regularly by looking at reddit from a `` private browsing '' window and seeing if their posts are still there . 
  ( that 's how easy it is . ), 
  if there 's a real person behind them they 'll figure out soon enough that they 've been shadowbanned . 
  an ip ban is probably better for these cases . 
  also , `` push an agenda '' tends to just mean `` say something the mods do n't agree with '' . 
   recruiting a `` substantial '' amount of new mods it also depends on who is recruiting and who is recruited , of course . 
  it also does n't mean neutrality - perhaps the exchanging of one agenda for another , depending on who is recruiting/ed . 
  55 % said no . 
  45 % said yes . 
  if that 45 % was armed ... 
  i did n't . 
  the bible belt only makes up ~ 3 % of the population . 
  that 's less than the muslims . 
  but they do exist , and they mostly live together in villages along the southwest-northeast diagonal . 
  this exists . 
  the not-as-progressives ( ca n't really call them conservative in the us sense , but they mostly are conservative in the `` let 's keep things the way they are '' sense ) , however , make up far more of the population . 
  just look at the last elections . 
  and this is stronger in the countryside than it is in the randstad . 
  of course it is not all of us , but you ca n't deny that it is part of us . 
   i have never seen any of the things you just said and im from one of the most religious parts . 
  are you saying you have n't seen places where dutch is the only language used in public , and where people tend to be wary of new ideas or foreign influence ? 
  i sure have . 
  i grew up in a village like that , and it was n't even particularly religious . 
  i also live in utrecht nowadays ( i studied there and found a job there ) , so i 've seen its surroundings and they seem similar . 
  as for christian fundamentalists , i can offer you [ this proof ] ( http://www.elsevier.nl/wetenschap/nieuws/2010/1/staphorst-mist-bijbelse-versie-in-archeologisch-rapport-elsevier257027w/ ) , where the municipality of staphorst had an archeological report changed because , you know , the earth is only 6000 years old . 
   a great ` fuck you ' statement quite literally , too . 
  given the huge amount of publicity it got it might well have made its & euro ; 200.000 back . 
  but will people come to rotterdam just to view kabouter buttplug ? 
  there are far better things to do in rotterdam , which people would probably come visit anyway even without kabouter buttplug . 
   sponsoring another production of do n't - care the musical or putting it in yet another museum of fuzzy caps or whatever but they do these things because of the art budget . 
  if it were left to private initiative , they would think about their investments and sponsor things they think they would make money on . 
  you only get do n't - care the musical because the civil servants do n't care either , they just have to get rid of the money . 
   `` multilingual , progressive , and quirky '' description of the dutch . 
  this is mainly amsterdam . 
  amsterdam is mainly a tourist attraction . 
  perhaps utrecht also counts , but it has the country 's largest university , and a lot of international students to boot ( it 's a very good university even internationally ) , so perhaps that 's to be expected . 
  then there 's rotterdam , which is a cosmopolitan , business-oriented city , so it matches `` multilingual '' , but not `` quirky '' , and only occasionally `` progressive '' . 
  think `` new york '' , not `` portland '' . 
  the hague does politics , both national and international ( eu/un ) , so `` multilingual '' still matches , but they act like , well , politicians . 
  these make up the randstad , the main point of contact with the outside world . 
  it should be noted that the only city of these where ( native ) dutch people are * not * in the minority is utrecht - and that 's basically only because of all the students at the university . 
  so , while this is where all the foreigners meet us , this is not a very dutch place compared to the rest of the country . 
  after all , it is also where we meet the rest of the world . 
  go outside of the randstad , however , and things turn to iowa soon enough . 
  ten miles is enough , usually . 
  all the multilingualism , progressiveness , and quirkiness is gone . 
  sure , people still speak english if pressed , but everything will be in dutch . 
  they 're tolerant enough to let you live your life without beating you up , but that 'll be it . 
  quirkiness will be met with `` act normal , that 's crazy enough '' . 
  we even have a bible belt . 
  it stretches in a narrow line from the southwest to the northeast of the country . 
  this is where you 'll find the bible-thumping calvinists . 
  the deal with them is basically that in their villages , they get to keep their lifestyle mostly unimpeded , while in return they will stay in their villages and not try to impede progress in the rest of the country . 
  their stance on , say , homosexuality ... well , you 're an american , you can imagine . 
  you will not be surprised that any dutch people who like multilingualism , progressiveness or quirkiness move away from these places to the randstad , further cementing the divide . 
  there are cities outside the randstad as well , but they 're smaller . 
  the attitudes in these tend to be somewhere in between . 
  generally , big city \u2192 international \u2192 open , multicultural , modern ; small village \u2192 local , traditional . 
   actually the current king is over 90 % german by blood i doubt you could in any way tell the difference between dutch people and germans from their blood . 
  this is what happens when you give municipalities an art budget . 
  which they must , of course , spend in full every year , because otherwise they 'll get less next year . 
  it results in some pretty ridiculous shit , and it would surprise me very much if there were n't kickbacks involved . 
  this thing cost nearly & euro ; 200.000 , and there was a big row over it back when it was installed . 
  the neo-nazis will threaten you and break your stuff , because you disagree with their political goals . 
  the antifas will threaten you and break your stuff , because you disagree with their political goals . 
  you used to have `` funniest home videos '' type shows which basically * were * `` ow , my balls ! '' . 
  and the only reason they 're gone is that we use youtube for that now . 
   it is unfair for the ones with special needs to pay for the other 's meals but get nothing themselves . 
  is it any more fair to take everyone else 's food away just because one parent thinks their kid is special ?
