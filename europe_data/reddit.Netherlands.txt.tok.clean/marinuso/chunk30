  there should be a law to make sure all media is clearly marked with the ultimate owner . 
  everything owned by murdoch should be clearly labeled `` murdoch '' , etc. 
   bobbe is especially enthusiastic about the communications team that handles all the questions from the press . 
  `` if a journalist approaches us , we just refer them to one of the press coordinators and let them handle everything , '' he says . 
  `` which is kind of a new way of working for us as well . '' they have such confidence in their project that they 've started out by limiting media access . 
  there is n't freedom of speech here . 
  the biggest protection we have is that the government may not demand prior censorship before publishing . 
  but once you 've gotten your ideas into the world , you can certainly be punished for them . 
   i ca n't speak directly for the netherlands in general , if you call these moroccans `` dutch '' to their face they 'd consider it a personal insult . 
   republican party allowed a populist to pass through while the democrats stacked the deck against the populist making waves among their ranks . 
  the republicans tried to stop trump too , they just failed . 
  partly because they have more candidates to begin with and seemingly less control , but also partly because [ the democrats had their allied media push trump because they thought it 'd be an easy win against him ] ( http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/hillary-clinton-2016-donald-trump-214428 ) . 
  trump took full advantage of that , of course . 
  that 's a bit stupid of him . 
  he got off without a punishment . 
  the next judge might not be so lenient . 
  [ article 137d ] ( http://www.wetboek-online.nl/wet/sr/137d.html ) : ( i 'll translate it so all the english people can follow it ) 1 . 
  he who publicly , in speech , writing or image , incites hatred or discrimination of people , or violent actions against person or property of people , because of their race , religion , philosophy , sex , hetero - or homosexual orientation , or their physical , psychological or mental handicap , will be punished with * imprisonment of at most a year or a fine of the third category * . 
  if the offense is committed by * a person who has made it into a profession or habit * , * or by two or more associated people * , imprisonment of at most two years or a fine of the fourth category will be prescribed . 
  so a pissed-off judge could put him in jail over this , for a year . 
  maybe two - this is n't his first brush with the law , and he put `` close the mosques '' in his election platform , so if the judge wants to say it 's his `` profession or habit '' that could be defended . 
  i could also imagine the judges getting pissed off over wilders prolonging the trials to use them as a public platform , and deciding to send a message . 
  that 's due to their first-past-the-post elections . 
  it makes it so that there are only two viable candidates , and if there are only two candidates then they have to try to take each other out . 
  you ca n't ever be nicer than the other , because that 'll lose you the election , so you have to fight dirty . 
  everyone has skeletons in their closet , so winning the election means convincing people you 're not as bad as your opponent ( by hammering on your opponent 's weaknesses ) , which leads to the dirty fighting . 
  european countries generally have parliamentary systems , so mud-slinging does n't work . 
  multiple candidates means that to win by mud-slinging , you 'd have to take them all out , which is not doable ; and the parliamentary system means that individual people do n't matter as much as parties anyway . 
  the best strategy here becomes to try to show your own strengths rather than your opponents ' weaknesses , so that 's what generally happens . 
  ( with the exception that everyone in politics is opposed to the rising populists and vice-versa , so between the populists and the established politicians you get mud-slinging , but at that point it 's a struggle between two factions again and not ` normal ' multi-party democracy . ), 
  [ the judge can already disenfranchise you and/or ban you from running for office again , as an add-on to any punishment of at least a year in jail . 
  ] ( https://www.kiesraad.nl/verkiezingen/inhoud/tweede-kamer/stemmen/uitsluiting-kiesrecht ) this was actually what i expected they were going to do . 
  if you want to get rid of the populist right , taking away the focal point is going to help a lot . 
  like with fortuyn , when he was shot the whole movement collapsed . 
  so give him a year in jail and ban him from politics . 
  but they did n't even end up giving him the $ 5000 fine . 
  what 's the point then ? 
  all he got is free publicity . 
  i ca n't keep track of all the allegiances anymore . 
  [ in germany they can apparently already ban you from seeing your own kids for wrongspeak , and it 's been like that for over a year . 
   there are many of these young people who do not know exactly how old they are , because it 's not something that you register in their home countries in the same way as in denmark oh , come on , that 's patently untrue . 
  even a shithole like eritrea keeps population records , never mind north africa or the middle east . 
  it 's not europe but these are n't some kind of pseudo-edenic amazon tribes . 
  they absolutely do record births . 
  the medieval caliphates already had serviceable population records , for crying out loud , and these people show up with iphones so they 're not * that * ` unspoilt by the modern world ' . 
  yes , they * do * know how old they are . 
  they also know that they can get free shit by lying about it . 
   we 're not likely to purposely destroy ourselves ( at least not militarily , we do have certain nations helping to do it with climate change ) . 
  we 're not likely to purposely destroy * ourselves * , but that only works if we all have to share the same planet . 
  we are * very * likely to purposely destroy * the other * , which is what it would become if we had multiple planets . 
  if flying cars are ever invented , they 'd be banned immediately . 
  think about it , you 'd have a thousand 9/11s every day just from people who are texting while flying . 
  there 's nowhere to go off this planet . 
  there are no habitable worlds within reach . 
  besides , imagine what would happen if we * did * have different planets ? 
  we 'd immediately start trying to blow each other 's planets up or otherwise render them uninhabitable . 
  we 'd probably succeed , and then we 'd wipe humanity out . 
  we need our petty tribalism to protect ourselves from the other guys ' petty tribalism . 
  these two are n't mutually exclusive . 
  this has been a thing for a long time . 
  in the netherlands we always use red pencils for voting , to prevent this kind of complaint . 
   with all the traffic between italy/germany passing through . 
  which causes environmental problems seems like they should 've voted for hofer if they wanted * that * to end ... 
  in the netherlands it 's 88 % , according to [ official government numbers from 2015 ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?vw=t&amp;dm=slnl&amp;pa=37325&amp;d1=a&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=0&amp;d5=0-4,137,152,220,237&amp;d6=0,4,9,14,18-19&amp;hd=151214-1201&amp;hdr=g2,g1,g3,t&amp;stb=g4,g5 ) . 
  there are 2.038.509 ` non-western immigrants ' out of 16.900.726 total population . 
  but this is a rosy picture . 
  first of all , there are only 13.235.405 actual dutchmen ( only 78 % ) . 
  second , that number actually includes third-generation immigrants . 
  yes , if your family has lived here for 3 generations , you are suddenly dutch , no matter that you grew up in a moroccan enclave , hold a moroccan citizenship , and do n't speak dutch . 
  actual ethnic statistics are n't kept , at least not openly . 
  third , that number has been holding mostly steady . 
  in the last 21 years , population has grown by 1.406.837 people , of whom only 240.231 ( 17 % ) dutch . 
  so 83 % of population growth in the last 20 years , and likely even more due to the third-generation crap , is immigrants . 
  fourth , the migrant crisis migrants have n't been added to this yet , and i would n't be surprised if there 's going to be over a million of them once all the family reunions have been done . 
  do n't worry , probably something else will go wrong this time . 
  it 's only the * third * attempt . 
  would n't that be funny ? 
   zero chance of staying here there 's a general pardon every few years . 
  all you have to do is hold out for a few years . 
  we do n't even deport illegals . 
  there 's zero chance of being formally * accepted * , but nobody ever leaves . 
  hell , it 's probably actually better if you do n't get accepted . 
  if you get official refugee status , there 's always a chance that they 'll review your case in a few years and decide it 's time for you to go home ... 
   this sign reads `` free haircut for everyone who brings a receipt of converting 300 dollars to lira '' . 
  or free food for 250 dollars . 
  the turks who live over here will sell you way cheaper food and haircuts . 
   voting for your interest is about as smart as trump dodging taxes ( or anybody for that matter , be he claimed it made him smart ) . 
  paying more taxes than you absolutely have to , now that 's the mark of intelligence . 
  the fact is that if you 're running any kind of business , all your competitors will use every loophole they can find , so if you do n't , you wo n't be able to compete . 
  that 's how it will always be , and the only way to fix it is to simplify the tax code so that there are n't so many loopholes . 
  ( though that is also nearly impossible , tax codes get that complicated because everyone with a lobbyist buys himself an exception , let that go on for a century or two and you 'll piss off literally the whole country if you try to make any change at all , because everyone 's depending on something . ), 
   voting for your interest is about the dumbest thing there is not as long as everyone else does the same thing . 
  it 's bad for everyone individually , and it 's bad for society as a whole , but if there is one altruist among all the selfish people , the altruist will suffer the most . 
  so , as an individual , voting for your interest will hurt you less than trying to ` do the right thing ' . 
  see also : [ prisoner 's dilemma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prisoner's_dilemma ) , though you probably already knew that . 
  the problem is n't that everyone could be better off if they cooperate , the problem is that you hurt yourself by cooperating if nobody else does , and you help yourself by defecting if you 're in a group of altruists . 
  solve them , and people will switch without it being mandatory . 
  if you need to make it mandatory , that is a good sign that the technology is not good enough yet . 
  if people choose to * pay for gasoline * rather than use electric cars , that 's pretty damning . 
  i 'm not shocked that a news organisation would be partisan .
