  it 's pretty much the same with any kind of change . 
  in the usa , when people want to change something , there are supporters and opponents . 
  in the netherlands , things just change , and while there are people who cheer and people who lament , there 's never any real opposition , even when the changes are obviously for the worse . 
  let alone with something like the gays , who are n't hurting anybody , so live and let live seems to apply . 
   until the lgbt community has equal rights in the law as a `` standard '' heterosexual couple , these marches should continue . 
  they do , in the netherlands . 
  they implemented it way back in 2001 , and did it by scrapping references to sex from the marriage laws . 
  it 's literally the same thing legally speaking , there 's no `` gay marriage '' , just marriage . 
  wherever there are differences lawfully speaking , it 's actually in favour of them ( higher punishment for beating them up etc ) , . 
  the one in amsterdam furthermore has the reputation that it 's completely commercialized . 
  companies fight over permits to get a boat in there . 
  it 's one big marketing opportunity . 
  this whole movement came from the us , they 're just true to their roots . 
  there are millions of turks . 
  they probably could . 
  as for the netherlands , i could certainly imagine that erdogan could pull a crimea in e.g. 
  rotterdam after scenes like [ these ] ( https://static.fd.nl/media/images/09/01/37/inline/1280x0/high/turken-rotterdam-hh.jpg?v=1 ) . 
  i would n't expect the dutch government to try to hold it . 
  they 'd much rather negotiate with the turks for access to the harbour than to see it destroyed in the war the turks could start with just the people that are here already , even though we could win that war if the government were willing to fight it . 
  would berlin be that much different ? 
  if anything the german government has even less of a backbone than the dutch one when it comes to standing up to anyone except eastern europeans . 
   one company , aquaminerals , turns wastewater into calcite pellets , which are great for water softening remember this , next time you 'd filter your water because you do n't like the taste of hard water . 
  if they went to syria and are stripped of british citizenship , they ca n't come back . 
   usually people tend to mean legally impossible when they talk about actions from a state though . 
  if anything , that holds way less for governments than in any other case . 
  normal people have to abide by the laws because the government can enforce them with violence . 
  for governments , it only matters whether some other country is willing to embargo you or maybe go to war . 
  this is quite the other thing . 
  there was nothing nazi about the restaurant at all . 
  some pegida members had the habit of eating there - and not doing anything else , mind you . 
  the municipal government then tried to pressure the owner into banning the ` nazis ' from his restaurant , and after he refused , he somehow attracted the attention of antifa , after which he had to close . 
  this is tyranny , and on top of that it is petty and needless tyranny . 
  it 's not like this is going to be the final nail in pegida 's coffin . 
  the god damn * government * just bullied some poor sap into closing his business just because he served people food . 
  ( if anything pegida has an opportunity here . 
  they could help the guy get set up somewhere else , and then have a new member and a pegida-supporting restaurant - and a ` success story ' so that the next guy the government tries to bully knows he has options ... ), 
  ok then , lobby for this , and when it gets though nobody will link to you at all anymore . 
  my god , you still have sauna ? 
  come on , it 's 2017 . 
  [ nepal will drown before we do . 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/7o8n5phoyjny.png ), 
   the day the average turk will be as rich as the average italian or spanish , sure we can talk , but that day is definitely not this century . 
  italy and spain are getting worse and worse , so that day may come sooner than you think . 
  then they 'll be able to stop the migrants from coming in the first place . 
   left wing state being successful i would n't call loss of territorial control successful . 
  in fact , that 's the very definition of state failure . 
   what makes this retard more newsworthy than all the others ? 
  because i doubt `` linda wenzel '' has a muslim background . 
  when dogs bark it 's normal , when the cat starts doing it , now it 's news . 
  i do n't think that counts as proper conversion . 
  also , old people can just work longer . 
  they also live longer , and remain healthy longer . 
  the previous dutch retirement age of 65 was set way back when that was more or less the life expectancy , which is almost 80 now . 
  raising it makes a lot of sense . 
  it 's a rock concert . 
  you start fights because you 're drunk and/or on drugs , not over ideas . 
   more than 20 illegal incidents were reported , mostly of illegal displays of `` symbols of unconstitutional organizations '' ( including nazi symbols ) , as well as eight incidents of criminal property damage , illegal drug use and verbal abuse , all committed under the influence of alcohol , police said . 
  six thousand people , and only ~ 20 crimes , most of which were just waving banned flags , and then on top of that verbal abuse , so less than 8 real crimes committed by six thousand people . 
  that 's one well-behaved rock concert . 
  people go to kebab shops for cheap fast food , not for a gourmet experience . 
  if you want to eat kebab for the taste , you 'd go to a real restaurant . 
  just like if you want a good hamburger , you do n't go to mcdonald 's either . 
  soon there will be an eu army too , so then we can have our very own civil war . 
  they have billionaire backers . 
  soros is disliked for a reason . 
  on top of that , the ngos doing this that people actually know about tend to have a good reputation , e.g. 
  doctors without borders is very much involved in the migrant smuggling . 
   if we take the h&s as representative of communism it 's simply not as unambigiously ` evil ' of a symbol as the swastika the swastika is an ancient symbol that has been used for a lot of things , only one of which was evil as far as i know . 
  ( i mean , [ these guys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jainism ) abhor violence to the point where they 're all vegetarian . 
  maybe `` clockwise swastika at a 45-degree angle in a circle '' would be a better comparison to the hammer and sickle . ), 
  the hammer and sickle , on the other hand , specifically represents communism . 
  and communist regimes have been every bit as horrible as fascist ones . 
  name anything horrible hitler did and stalin has done it too . 
  concentration camps ? 
  [ check ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulag ) . 
  [ check ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decossackization ) and [ check ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) . 
  starting ww2 ? 
  [ he ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) [ certainly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) [ helped ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_invasion_of_poland ) . 
  he 's actually responsible for more death than hitler . 
  but he won the war , so he 's the hero . 
  you could say that other communist regimes were n't quite as horrible as stalin 's , but then again the other fascist regimes were n't quite as horrible as hitler 's either . 
  hitler was pretty uniquely evil . 
  other fascist dictators never got anywhere near him , brutal though they were . 
  not franco , not salazar , not metaxas , not even mussolini . 
  stalin , however , is easily joined by mao , kim il sung , and pol pot - who wiped out a fourth of his country in four year 's time and famously ordered everyone killed who wore glasses . 
  oh , come on . 
  people do n't criticize soros because he 's jewish . 
  people criticize soros because he became super-wealthy by tanking currencies on purpose , and then uses his money to push his values onto people and mess with their lives . 
  he 's the left-wing version of the koch brothers . 
  who by the way are also jewish . 
  should they be immune from criticism , too ? 
  it used to be the flemings , until a bunch of reforms starting in the 1960s that basically established separate governments for both parts . 
  the belgian government is of unrivaled complexity nowadays , it 's one big clusterfuck . 
  the country is pretty much split in two along cultural lines . 
  there 's a federal government , three community governments , two regional governments , and then provincial governments under that , which have their own subdivisions . 
  and brussels is its own very special clusterfuck . 
  if you live in belgium you have * six * governments above you , all of them with their own specific competencies , which are n't even always well-defined and can conflict . 
  all of this for a country of only 11 million people . 
  the flemings have still not really forgiven the walloons . 
  ( vandalizing bilingual road signs is still pretty common , and do n't try to talk to old people in french . ),
