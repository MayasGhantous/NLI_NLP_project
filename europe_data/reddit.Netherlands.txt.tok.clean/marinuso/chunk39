  but not deported . 
  there 'll be a mass pardon in a year or so , do n't worry . 
  we 're overdue for one , and besides , klaver would n't be klaver if he did n't get that done . 
  ( at least he 'll have to compromise on the over-the-top environmentalism , i guess . ), 
  do n't people get angry that they have to pay taxes in order to fund the healthcare of illegal immigrants ? 
  it reads as if anyone who wants to can just come to spain and get healthcare at the spanish taxpayer 's expense . 
  the nhs in britain [ apparently has notoriously awful working conditions ] ( http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/12/solidarity/ ) . 
   it 's not like you could carry out investigations in silent and then go public after you are done with it . 
  what they are doing is publicly suspecting every single soldier of being a nazi . 
  they 're probably just trying to stay ahead of the media . 
  this way they at least ca n't claim it 's structural . 
   odinsknoten [ the german football association has one on its logo ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutscher_fu%c3%9fball-bund ) . 
  if even the germans are n't worried it might have nazi connotations , it probably is n't nazi . 
  i think if you had a referendum like that , and it would actually * pass * , then you 'd have bigger problems than just the referendum . 
  if a majority of the country really thinks that systematically killing minorities is a good idea , you 're probably past the point where the laws will stop them . 
   this is interpreted as including the death penalty . 
  only until they decide to interpret it differently . 
  even the constitutional court are still people . 
  not that it really matters because the eu does ban it . 
  when you 're really dealing with a dictatorial government , they 'll find ways to kill people anyway . 
  you might not get an official death sentence , but there 'll just be polonium in your tea one day . 
   many in the party think marine is too `` moderate '' so they just never want to be elected ? 
   but oh boy do they love to put security on our nuclear power plants on high alert . 
  in the netherlands [ they once tried to sabotage a nuclear waste transport ] ( http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/article20833150.ece ) . 
  thankfully , we apparently take safety seriously when it comes to transporting nuclear waste , but the fact that they even tried speaks volumes about them . 
  we pretty clearly do n't . 
  the people in the `` iran 1970 '' photo are part of a small westernized elite though , and the people in the `` afghanistan 1967 '' are probably straight-up westerners and not afghans at all by the looks of them . 
  there 's blondes in there for christ 's sake . 
  the vast majority of those countries were rural , conservative muslims even back then . 
  ( edit : these do in fact seem to be examples of rural conservatives overcoming a small globalized elite . 
  see also : other political trends . 
  i do n't think it 'll happen in the west because it is more urbanized , but erdogan is like this too and even trump is , a bit . ), 
  at least according to the referendum , the turks in germany are far more pro-erdogan than the turks in turkey . 
  why should they be against the death penalty ? 
  that was a real scandal . 
  she kept classified emails on an insecure server that she had deliberately set up outside the normal government systems . 
  then some of the emails leaked out and there was a lot of damning stuff in them . 
  * then * they tried to divert people 's attention by claiming it had been russian hackers , and hillary wiped the server when the fbi came looking . 
  undoubtedly memes were made about it , but it was a real scandal , not just something 4chan came up with . 
  it 's not thousands . 
  [ in russia there are only three journalists in jail , and while turkey is a lot worse it 's still only 49 . 
  ] ( https://rsf.org/en/barometer?year=2017&amp;type_id=235#list-barometre ) there 's also still a big difference between red countries like russia and turkey , and black countries like china . 
  in china there 's an official censor . 
  they tell you what to write about and what not to write about , and all media is subordinate to it , by law . 
  if you do n't play ball they simply shut you down . 
  that goes a lot further than what you see in russia or turkey - both countries at least still pretend to have some press freedom . 
  i 'm not . 
  a stickied , updating `` look what the muslims did * today * '' thread sounds more like something the_donald would do . 
  in 25 years : cyprus 2.0, 
  the election was so close it had to be redone once because it was too close to call . 
  here 's how ~ ~ bernie ~ ~ melenchon can still win !, 
  poisoning can be a very grueling experience that lasts for hours . 
  hanging is probably better , though it would depend on the poison . 
  it 's also a good place for political parties to put people they have no real job for but ca n't drop . 
  it 's the political drain of europe . 
  as a party , you put people in the eu parliament if you do n't want them in your own . 
  nobody cares about the ep , and it does n't have a lot of power anyway , so it ends up mattering to nobody . 
  the common people do n't show up for the elections either . 
  of course , the weirdos and no-lifers * do * show up for the elections , so all manner of idiots get elected . 
  if you had the american system with only one round and an electoral college , le pen would be president now by the looks of it . 
  it 's pretty much the same university system already , is n't it , high prices included . 
  continental universities are generally quite different from anglo-american ones . 
  it 's a hunger games reference . 
  the eu just nixed our net neutrality too . 
  that 's going to cost support , the techies were all very pro-europe generally and i 'm sure some changed their mind now . 
  probably because it makes money and russia is n't that rich . 
  ca n't just spend money studying literary criticism and self-actualising when you need to survive . 
  iran is actually similar . 
  many women in the sciences there . 
  there was an international incident just days before the election . 
  [ the wikipedia page on it is pretty in-depth . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_dutch%e2%80%93turkish_diplomatic_incident ) from the dutch side at least , it looks bizarre . 
  the government reacted very uncharacteristically strongly . 
  it made rutte look like he had a spine , and it gave erdogan the opportunity to show his people an enemy . 
  in the [ formation letters ] ( https://www.kabinetsformatie2017.nl/binaries/kabinetsformatie/documenten/verslagen/2017/03/27/verslag-verkenner-schippers/verslag+verkenner+schippers.pdf ) , rutte says he wants the next cabinet to a ) lower taxes , b ) invest in nursing homes , c ) improve the labour market , d ) clean energy and e ) more money to the army and the police . 
  nothing about immigration . 
  meanwhile , d66 and gl specifically name a ` humane refugee policy ' , and rutte has already given gl the clean energy thing for free . 
  he basically helped erdogan win his referendum in exchange for erdogan helping him win the elections here . 
  it gave them both an opportunity to play the tough guy for a grumbling audience . 
  he also spent the campaign period saying he 'd do something about the immigration , and has seemingly already dropped it ~ ~ during the coalition talks ~ ~ before the coalition talks even started ( edit : wording ) . 
  nobody cares about that either . 
   there was a map on this sub a few years ago that showed the more religious ( generally more right-wing ) parts of the netherlands had lower vaccination rates than other parts of the country . 
  that has nothing to do with american coastal liberals . 
  it 's always been the case . 
  these people are serious fundamentalist christians ( though still not the american brand of fundamentalist christians ) , and they believe vaccination to be against god 's will . 
  ( do n't ask me why . ), 
  these are the kind of people who wear black stockings and do n't have tvs in their home . 
  the vaccination rate among them has actually been going up in recent years ( and so has tv ownership ) . 
  they 're not necessarily `` right-wing '' either , in the mainstream sense , it 's more complicated than that ( though they sure are socially reactionary ) . 
  they generally live in their own little villages , which are run as near-theocracies ( the police there will fine you for swearing , no joke ) , and they are not part of the mainstream at all . 
  instead , they have their own political party , the sgp , which has 3 seats in the national parliament but absolutely dominates the local governments in those villages . 
  ( this is how they can democratically run their near-theocracies . ), 
  the deal with them is basically that the national government leaves them be and in return they leave us be . 
  i also do n't really think that it 's ignorance in their case . 
  they know that vaccines will prevent diseases , and they generally do n't believe that they 'll make you sick or that they cause autism or anything like that , it 's just against their religion so they refuse . 
  -- what * has * been happening in the netherlands lately is that the vaccination rate in cities like amsterdam has been going down . 
  * that * is wannabe american coastal liberals mimicking the real ones . 
  it 's stupid but it 's true . 
  in the netherlands it has to pass twice , first with a simple majority , then new elections must be held , then the new parliament must pass it with 2/3rds . 
  that is so that the people get a chance to vote on it as well .
