  so , we 'd not just need to get rid of your monarchy but of the very idea of denmark , as well as your language , your family names and even your pastries . 
  good idea ? 
  but what do you do if one member state wants to do something another does n't ? 
  for example , consider this scenario : italy is suffering riots . 
  it decides it wants to use the army to stop them , but the eu parliament has human rights concerns . 
  meanwhile , milan burns down . 
  or this one : italy is suffering riots . 
  it is trying to deal with them in a civilised manner and does n't want the army , however , the eu parliament decides enough is enough and sends the army in anyway . 
  italy ca n't stop them , and what amounts to a foreign army seizes and occupies milan . 
  or this one : russia invades romania . 
  germany and france vote against involvement , because they think romania is a shithole and not worth sacrificing their own young men for . 
  romania has no army and ca n't defend itself . 
  russia takes it without firing a shot , and the eu parliament ends up formally ceding it , cheering at how much money was saved by not defending romania . 
  and then there 's the issue of sovereignty . 
  at least now , if the eu issues a batshit directive we can choose not to obey it , because the national governments hold military control over their territories and therefore the final say about what happens . 
  that would be gone . 
  then why do n't you stop it ? 
  i mean , could n't you just send the army in ? 
  they could beat the rioters with their broomsticks  ( or , you know , just fill a water cannon with waterproof ink . 
  you can arrest everyone who got stained at your leisure afterwards , and then next year there wo n't be riots . ), 
  no , it 's not . 
  immigrant = someone who moves to a country to make it his new home and settle there . 
  expat = someone going abroad temporarily for work or study expats tend to be from rich countries , because if their host country is significantly better than their home country , they would be tempted to become immigrants . 
  those moroccans or tunisians probably are n't going back to morocco or tunisia , which makes them immigrants . 
  and yet norway and finland are similar , and do n't seem to have gone off the deep end like sweden has . 
  or does sweden just get all the bad publicity ? 
   i find it peculiar how people so rarely distinguish between different types of immigrants . 
  highly-skilled migrants are n't very visible , especially since they do n't cause trouble and there are n't very many of them . 
  and they live in expat bubbles . 
  unless you 're in their circles , you hardly know that they exist . 
  they also typically do not settle here , and they have no direct cultural influence . 
   it seems like you 'd want to distinguish between people opportunistically seeking ' a better welfare state ' , and people who are genuinely in need of asylum from wartorn areas . 
  that difference is just one of degree . 
  how much should your life suck before you 're no longer an opportunist but a refugee ? 
  it also does n't really matter to the host country : they have to be fed and housed all the same no matter why they are here . 
  should we take in people if there 's war in their area ? 
  what about a famine ? 
  what if it 's just poor ? 
  what about if there 's a dictatorship ? 
  at this point it just becomes triage , assuming you do n't just let them all in . 
  if you want to distinguish , you should distinguish between people who are here temporarily and people who come here to settle . 
  you appear to trust them on their word . 
  you also appear to think that no changes will be made , and that all the backdoors everyone will ask for will not be granted for once . 
  on the other hand , if you have a cellphone , the point is moot because they track those anyway . 
   they are still judged first as a foreigner rather than as a citizen of whatever country they were raised in . 
  to be fair , they all hold either dual citizenship or just the foreign citizenship . 
  even three or four generations in . 
  even if maintaining their old citizenship means going off to fight in the other army for a bit . 
  so this is not 100 % our fault . 
   they learned how to debate , speak , negotiate in school dutchman here . 
  no we do n't . 
  perhaps in the best schools in wassenaar they do , but the schools us mortals attend certainly do n't teach that . 
  i 'd like to say we 're taught to write correctly , but lots of people do n't even manage that . 
  i grew up near the border and everyone who could , sent their kid to school in belgium . 
  if they care so much , let them take the migrants . 
  their country is mostly empty . 
  a lot of it is n't even cultivated . 
  you could put 20 million people in the midwest and nobody would even notice . 
  the refugee problem would be solved in an instant . 
  this is not actually the structural problem that it is always made out to be . 
  there 's a glut of old people due to the postwar baby boom , but beyond that , the population triangle looks normal ( if steep ) . 
  once the 1950 generation dies , we 'll be back to normal . 
  india is hardly a successful example of anything . 
  [ nearly half the kids are starving . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/10/child-malnutrition-india-national-shame ) it makes botswana look like switzerland . 
  [ 400 million people do n't even have access to electricity . 
  ] ( http://www.psmag.com/nature-and-technology/indias-struggle-get-reliable-power-hundreds-millions-people-93186 ) furthermore , the `` tolerance '' does n't really exist either . 
  there 's basically a hindu part and a muslim part , and there are frequent killings on the `` border '' . 
  the smaller religions also kill each other constantly . 
  [ everyone hates everyone else . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religious_conflicts_in_india ) of course , religion is n't the only thing they fight over . 
  [ this communist rebellion has been going on for four decades now . 
  ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeracorrespondent/2011/10/20111019124251679523.html ) and if there 's nothing else , there 's always good old [ racism ] ( http://www.iwgia.org/news/search-news?news_id=616 ) . 
  comparing it to neighboring , mostly homogenous china , which was worse off than india in the 1970s but did manage to make progress , makes the whole thing an argument * against * diversity , and most of india would probably have been better off if it had been 20 separate countries like it was before colonization . 
  so * now * they 're against immigration ? 
  i wonder if it has to do with the fact that the blue area used to be german . 
  after wwii , stalin wanted more territory , so they moved poland west at the expense of germany . 
  [ see this map ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:border_changes_in_history_of_poland.png ) . 
  they did try to ethnically cleanse the area , but as you know such things rarely fully succeed . 
  you can also interpret it to mean greece is going the way of the ukraine . 
   that is why bernie sanders has been so much more effective than any similar candidate in the us . 
  bernie does n't stand a chance of even becoming the nominee . 
  i do n't know if you can call him effective . 
  ( it 's too bad , really . 
  i would 've wanted to see sanders vs trump , i think it 'd make for an entertaining spectacle . ), 
  [ at least for china it does n't seem to be comprehensive . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/rail_map_of_china.svg/2000px-rail_map_of_china.svg.png ) given that , i would n't trust its completeness anywhere else either . 
  women have always worked . 
  for that matter , children used to work too . 
  it was due to the fruits of a hundred years of industrialization , coupled with the labour movements , that single-income families even became possible . 
  now they seem to be on their way out again . 
  is this `` women 's liberation '' or is it simply the lower classes becoming worse off once more ? 
   despite the protest , that saw some people carrying sticks and iron bars and burning tyres imagine how this would 've been reported had the protesters been right-wingers . 
   so inviting in millions of people will replace the germans and keep germany ( stan ) competitive economically . 
  but what use is this ? 
  it would n't be germany anymore . 
  it does n't even make sure the current germans will have a decent old age . 
  once the young people are mostly immigrants or immigrant-descendants , they 'll go `` wait a minute , why are we paying the pensions of these people we have nothing at all to do with ? '', 
  there are no thresholds in the dutch system . 
  there are 150 seats , if you get 1/150th of the vote you get 1 seat .
