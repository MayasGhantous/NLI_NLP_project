  changing the constitution on the other hand is harder : it would require 66 % approval in the lower house , then 66 % approval in the upper house as well ( which is appointed by the provincial boards , which are elected in separate elections ) , then the lower house would be dissolved , new elections would be held , and if you get the 66 % approval * again * , then you can change the constitution . 
  well , [ they had will.i.am at davos ] ( https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/will-i-am-let-s-put-our-optimism-goggles-on/ ) , so who knows . 
  well , it 's vox . 
  what did you expect ? 
  it says a lot that the gypsies are no longer dead last . 
  it was the same for the czech one that came by earlier . 
   public money should not be spent on this . 
  ( before complaining about erdogans calls for censorships a few days later . ), 
  there 's a big difference there . 
  erdogan wants total control over the media . 
  ( even in foreign countries ! ), 
  afd guy just does n't want to be made to pay for agitation against him . 
  ( this is why i 'm against government-owned media on principle . 
  they always toe the party line of whomever is in power , they must because that 's who pays them . 
  with private media , at least the money comes from advertisers and subscribers , i.e. 
  people who choose to pay for it , rather than from everyone . ), 
  now define `` equality '' and `` fairness '' . 
  that 's were the real disagreement is going to be . 
   i would quit my office job in a second well , buy some land and start a farm !, 
  what 's wrong with czechoslovakia ? 
  there was no violence and both countries are doing decently . 
   the native population still scoring high , but the newcomers are scoring lower and thus dragging down the average . 
  this stat demonstrates that the native population is n't getting as impacted and now sweden is educating a lot of migrants . 
  not necessarily . 
  first of all , they 're obviously not managing to educate the migrants to an acceptable standard , or the scores would n't tank that hard . 
  second , the extra attention that the migrants need means the natives will get less attention , and will as a result also do worse than before . 
  lose-lose . 
   ruins the public support . 
  depends on which segment of the public . 
  especially if it 's clear that the force is necessary , i.e. 
  if they do show up with battering rams again . 
   no retarded law , enacted by retarded lawmakers can force anyone to break the math behind encryption and succeed . 
  no , but they can certainly jail you for failing to . 
  they probably ca n't even tell whether you 're actually incapable of breaking the encryption or simply refusing to cooperate , and even if they could i doubt they 'd care much . 
  the result will be that companies do n't implement such encryption , or at least do n't offer it in france , because they 'll know that if the government says `` decrypt this '' and they ca n't , the government will jail them . 
  end-users can of course still download open-source encryption programs and do it by themselves , but that was n't what this law was supposed to prevent anyway , as it targets companies and not end-users . 
  i have n't seen any in flight either , but they * do * seem to be landing everywhere nowadays . 
  so , you 're saying that a big influx of people from elsewhere will greatly change a community , and not necessarily for the better ? 
  violence + violence = peace . 
  if they keep fighting each other , eventually there will be nobody left , and then there will be peace . 
  hungary built a fence , and it mostly worked . 
  the response was : a lot of `` nazi ! '', 
  shouts , then a whole lot of nothing , then gleeful gloating in the press as some of the migrants cut holes in it and tried to sneak through . 
  ( despite the fact that they were caught doing this , and can therefore now be jailed and then banned , so they are still stopped . ), 
  so even * if * trump gets elected ( which i doubt ) , and even * if * he gets to build his wall afterwards ( which i doubt even more ) , then we 'll probably see no more change in western europe from it than we did from the hungarian fence . 
  they 'll just call him names and gloat at every mexican who gets in despite it , even if it ends up cutting the flow by 90 % they 'll still call it an absolute failure . 
  i do n't see how his stance on immigration will help us in any way . 
  it 's not been obama inviting all these people in , so it 's not going to be trump who stops the flow either imo . 
  the only way he could help is by stabilizing the middle east , which i do n't see him doing . 
  part of it is how easy it is to get a teacher in trouble over `` violence '' against his students . 
  we really need to bring back `` innocent until proven guilty '' . 
  you accuse a teacher of being violent ? 
  ok , you prove it , and you also prove that it was excessive and/or undue . 
  and until then we leave the teacher alone and do n't punish him . 
  edit : made a logic mistake ( i had ` prove that it was ** n't ** excessive or undue ' , of course they should prove that it ** was ** ), 
  wait ...  afghanistan  gulf state  emir i think something is not quite right here . 
  which is itself based on a true story , so apparently this kind of thing happens more . 
  i do n't think you 'd want any organs you 've fished out of the canals of amsterdam . 
  well , i understand that reading assignments are a lot harder when you do n't speak the language ... 
  remember when blaming rape on the victim was considered a conservative position , and it was the left wing that advocated against it ? 
   can they even pinpoint these countries on a map ? 
  they seem to be able to find it pretty well . 
   us presidents are almost always english ancestry . 
  funnily enough , even the current one !, 
  ( through his mother . ), 
  he said 200 years , not 20 . 
  german . 
  i do n't think there even is a coherent eu policy , it 's all done at the national level . 
  god damn immigrants coming here and bringing their ideologies . 
  we should have some kind of restrictions on who can get in here . 
  wait ... 
  but this is exactly my point . 
  the fact that people will trust even the russians over the german police in a case like this is exactly the kind of thing you 'd bring upon yourself by cover-ups like this . 
  is n't it a sad state of affairs ? 
  the facts of the matter are these : the germans tried to cover up the cologne attacks , failed , and in doing so encouraged everyone else to speak out as well . 
  it turned out that half of europe had been hushing up migrant crime for years . 
  in the face of that , a 13-year-old claimed to have been raped by muslims , and then the police said she was making it up . 
  that was the information we had . 
  can you really blame anyone for trusting the girl over the police at this point ? 
  and of course the russians jumped on it , because they have a lot to gain by destabilizing the eu even further . 
  the russians are probably dancing with joy at this point . 
  and now it turns out the 13-year-old was in fact covering for herself . 
  at least the proper facts came out . 
  ( and she was still abused by two turks , if the article is to believed , but at another time ; she 's too young to consent in any case . ), 
  but what i meant to say is this : if there had been no post-nye coverup , pretty much nobody would 've believed the russians over the germans . 
   huh , but reddit and russia said it was a high ranking conspiracy by the police and merkel to cover up a refugee crime . 
  well , the thing is , once you cover up refugee crime once , people will assume that you 're going to do it more . 
  the police and the media have squandered quite a lot of trust when it comes to these issues , due to their prior behaviour . 
  then add in the right-wingers going `` see ? 
  see ? 
  we were right all along !, 
  about * everything * we were saying !, 
  '' , and now it 's * they * who get the benefit of the doubt . 
  this is why covering things up ` not to give ammunition to the political right ' is such a bad strategy . 
  no way eastern europe is going to accept a harmonized migration policy , especially since under germany 's leadership such a thing is going to turn out to be the resettlement of the entire middle east into the visegrad countries just as a fuck you . 
  the french canadians are most certainly still around though . 
   doubting the inevitability of progress of civilisation that 's far from inevitable . 
  it 's not like civilisations have n't collapsed before . 
  besides , progress towards * what * exactly ? 
  so it 's a population density map ?
