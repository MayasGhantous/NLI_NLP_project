  we have a soft g and can pronounce `` goederenwagon '' without any issues . 
  i do n't know in what kind of society `` silencing dissenting opinions using violence '' would be considered progress . 
  but the gist is that because of bird flu ( and therefore rising prices ) we imported a lot of eggs from other countries . 
  the problem is that eggs from ukraine ( that are n't up to our environmental standards and rules for animal health ) were cheaply imported through poland under a polish label , meaning they are automatically approved for the european market . 
  this makes it impossible to compete for western european countries with ukrainian export . 
  you 're right , since 2015 they have a two-child policy . 
   the existence of organisations like the antifa does n't make afd , pegida et al more acceptable . 
  i never argued that , but you ca n't accept one , and dismiss the other . 
  i want to make one distinction though . 
  pegida and antifa are dangerous action groups and should n't be lumped in with the political parties . 
  `` i 'm allowed to physically abuse a person just because of their opinions . '', 
   aka admit being a fuckin nazi q.e.d. 
  i voted against the association treaty with ukraine because i feared for animal rights ( and rightfully so , if i heard the recent messages about the chicken industry ) . . 
  this subreddit branded me as a right wing populist and downvoted me into oblivion when i mentioned i voted against . 
   im actively antifa ( far left ) this gets upvoted . . try saying you 're a member of pegida , or even a afd/pvv/trump supporter and you 'll get lynched on this subreddit . 
  that is also visible in [ this table ? 
  ] ( https://i.sli.mg/kydrr8.png ) i think i do n't understand what information you are exactly looking for . 
  only really stupid people or people powerful enough to know people wo n't care will admit they censor shit . 
  ridiculously higher . 
  ( like 3-4 times higher ) see the linked table . 
  dutch ( 0.83 % ) 2nd gen westerners ( 1.16 % ) 2nd gen westerners from new european states ( 1.59 % ) 2nd gen turks ( 3.62 % ) 2nd gen moroccans ( 7.36 % ) * i double checked this one . . 1st gen was 2.52 % * 2nd gen surinamese ( 4.41 % ) 2nd gen antillean ( 4.53 % ) average non-western 2nd gen ( 4.54 % ), 
  yeah , let him prove that finnish police did n't say something . 
  could we just make a deal with chinese farmers ? 
  they want a son because of their one-child-policy , so they could just send all their unwanted girls to europe . 
  those girls are n't being murdered , en we get cute chinese women . 
  it 's a win-win !, 
   such illegal entry which hurts no body ) it does n't ? 
  who do you think has to pay for food and housing ? 
  also , if you want to exclude victimless crimes , you should do that for every crime without victims ( like tax evasion , public indecency , etc. ), 
   alt-right is ( ironically ) a bit like fundamentalist religion you mean they are misunderstood , because alt-right has nothing to do with extremists and we should n't focus on the few that ruin it for the mass but respect their culture ? 
  yeah , because people love getting ads for products they just bought . 
  schr\u00f6dinger 's migrant : he is a refugee if he needs food and housing , but he is n't if he turns out to be a criminal . 
   her party is full of socialists , protectionists, 
  far-right is a shitty term : right-wing economics + left-wing social views = centre party left-wing economics + right-wing social views = far-right . 
  makes literally no sense . 
  why are we so triggered by the use of words like `` virtue signalling '' and `` social justice warriors '' while at the same time have no issue calling people `` facists '' and `` alt-right neonazis '' ? 
  it 's not like we could n't make a gutmensch calendar with made-up words to dismiss right-wingers . 
   i am absolutely sure it has nothing to do with colonial powers , it must be something else . 
  australia and canada are indeed corrupt shitholes . 
   worse would be not having the infrastructure in place to know any of this information . 
  worse would be knowing the information and failing to neutralise the obvious threat to society . 
  exactly !, 
  wtf is that canadian thinking by putting european citizens first ? 
  ridiculous !, 
  they will be the first colonists of mars . 
  we did the same with australia and that country worked out fine for the most part . 
  i would never argue for dissolving the eu . 
  does n't mean we have to grin and bear everything . 
  everyone who wants to critique the eu is bombarded as being an eu-hating-russia loving fascist , and that is getting really annoying . 
  i like the european union , but i fundamentally disagree with the current `` more eu will solve everything '' course that verhofstadt and this subreddit seems to push . 
  there is no support among the people for federalisation , nobody in my country feels a connection between them and for example estonia , portugal or croatia and forcing further integration will do more harm than good . 
  hmm . . what 's the difference between late '90s europe and 2010 's europe ? 
  forgetting about terror attacks ironically proved his point . . a sad truth . 
   he said , adding a message for the attacker : `` if he does not like the way people live here , just leave the country . '' even the muslim community itself are racists according to redditors on this subreddit . 
   the inactivity of the governments in the nothern eu . 
  we 're not completely to blame . 
  it 's not like the eastern countries are so welcoming to refugees . 
  but why keep him alive and in the truck during the final stretch ? 
  that seems like a liability to me . 
  and this is why nobody takes the left seriously . 
  [ last week ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xrsgjbbr60&amp;t=89s ), 
  even though he 's right , i did n't hear cox when verhofstadt blamed farage for aleppo . 
  i have zero empathy for terrorists . 
  nobody would 've dared to tweet that shit when breivik murdered those children . 
  okay , you are right , muslim extremism is completely fine then . 
  my bad . 
  move along everyone . 
   in every country are extremist . . you dont have to be a refugee to be one . 
  well , there is one common factor though ... 
  accident is apparently still a possibility . 
  that would be the craziest accident in the last decade . . 
  you 're right ; i meant prime-minister . 
  it 's called `` minister-president '' in dutch and it 's late , alright !, 
  wilders is doing well , but because of our multi-party political system he probably wo n't become prime minister . 
  people are completely stupid in these live threads , i 'm not even sure about that . 
  poe 's law in action . 
  why would an alt-right neonazi attack a christmas market ? 
   it disgusts me so much that everyone has to use this as a mean to push their agenda of banning refugees from our so-called `` developed countries '' . 
  well , it disgusts me so much that you and other people use this thread as mean to push their agenda that it 's `` not that bad '' even though people died . 
  probably not , i would guess the same , but i rather wait for conformation . 
  only that he 's caught . 
  pale , black hair probably ? 
  because obviously germany needs your respect . . 
  uuh , no they are n't wrong ? 
  english | nederlands : -- | : -- athens | athene baku | bakoe belgrade | belgrado berlin | berlijn brussels | brussel bucharest | boekarest budapest | boedapest copenhagen | kopenhagen lisbon | lissabon london | londen luxembourg | luxemburg moscow | moskou paris | parijs prague | praag vienna | wenen warsaw | warschau yerevan | jerevan the rest is the identical to english . 
  i 'm not saying it is , but what makes you so sure ? 
  it 's not like they will calmly execute the guy and put a `` state sanctioned '' - sticker on the body . 
  edit : [ looks ] ( https://twitter.com/charles_lister/status/810901783421841411?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw ) like he was a police agent . 
  also , they updated the article with moving footage of the assassination attempt . 
  ( caution : shocking footage ), 
  possible assassination of an ambassador ... that 's a casus belli . 
  very bad news . 
   she could potentially have been sentenced to a year in prison but escaped a sentence and emerges from the trial without a criminal record . 
   explaining the verdict , which took many by surprise , judge martine ract madoux was quoted by reuters as saying : `` the context of the global financial crisis in which madame lagarde found herself in should be taken into account . '', 
  she also cited ms lagarde 's good reputation and international standing as reasons . 
  in dutch we call this ` class justice ' . 
  it says plenty that only one country has a `` pro '' - argument that is actually beneficial for the eu , and that 's only a `` potentially one day '' - scenario . 
  does that average include all `` non-native '' dutchmen ?

  pvda is probably the party with the most ridiculed eufemisms .
