  because they have too many differences : we have left cosmopolitans ( groenlinks ) , eurocritical socialists ( sp ) , trying-to-save-the-earth leftists ( pvdd ) and leftwing-with-no-spine ( pvda ) . 
  `` the one i like is superreal and the one i did n't like is fake news '', 
   yeah , but is christmas specific to german culture ? 
  you are not in the place to judge whether or not something is german culture . 
  you are just grasping at straws here . 
  well , everybody knows that progressives have no biases . 
  you forgot to mention the fact that the german teacher are paid from german tax money , kinda important detail . 
  and it is . 
  we have the highest sentences of europe and our prison system is considered one of the best of the world . 
  i never said either . 
  are we comparing terrorists and murderers with innocent children now ? 
  not a good basis , but it should be an important part of a sentence so everyone still respect the law . 
  our justice system gets praised constantly for their reform rate , even though we have harsh punishments . 
  it seems like we do reform better than other countries , even if we have the possibility for life-long sentences . 
  did their victims need to die ? 
  very probable . 
  d66 is as federalist as can be , even throwing 50 years of their hard work under the bus , just to please alde . 
  and the senators of the other party ( cda ) already said they are heavily pro-ratification , going against the wishes of their own members of parliament . 
  it 's probably 2005 all over again . 
  well , funny thing ; it turns out if you do exactly what the eu wants you to do , they have no problems at all . 
  but please , do n't start thinking for yourselves , they hate when countries do that . 
  if verhofstadt becomes chairman , there is hardly any difference . 
  both get a hard-on for unbridled expansionism , and both make ridiculous accusations like verhofstadt blaming ukip for the deaths in aleppo . 
  research was published in november 2016 . 
  ah , another one spewing fact-free bullshit . 
  that was only 3 % of the no-votes . 
  luckily the radboud university did an actual study instead of voicing their fee-fees as facts . 
  most important reason to vote yes : -- reason | % of the voters -- | -- support ( the population of ) ukraine | 37.7 % economically positive | 21,0 % voting rights | 7,9 % against poetin and russia | 7,2 % pro-eu | 6,7 % against the organisation of the referendum | 1,5 % [ national referendum research 2016 ] ( http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/813323/web_96646_onderzoeksrapport_nro_2016nw.pdf ) , p. 17 most important reason to vote against -- reason | % of voters -- | -- the corruption in ukraine | 34,1 % fear of a eu-membership for ukraine | 16,6 % vote against the eu | 7,5 % not wanting to anger russia and putin | 4,5 % voting against our government | 3,2 % voting rights | 2,3 % [ national referendum research 2016 ] ( http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/813323/web_96646_onderzoeksrapport_nro_2016nw.pdf ) , p. 18 [ post in dutch ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/5iitpd/deal_in_eu_rutte_gaat_toch_instemmen_met/db8j3zx/ ), 
  they wo n't . 
  they will always bend over for our european overlords . 
  do you really think they need a majority to do some major damage ? 
  this is the perfect example of integration . 
   heads up : it was in dubai , not saudi same shit , different sandbox . 
  good . 
  at least one person in european politics with a spine . 
  [ is the leaked strategy of the dutch parliament good enough ? 
  ] ( http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/sites/default/files/content/documents/2016/02/18/46_vragen_oekraine_referendum.pdf )  5 ) i think our country has a good feeling what this referendum is about : how we should work together with an eu-neighbour without it becoming a member . 
  you mean that time when they said they wanted to help investigate the situation but could n't facilitate safe access to the crash site and failed to give us their radar imaging ? 
  yeah , we did n't forget . 
  i forgot that we became part of the usa after the marshall plan . . 
  i fail to see why that should be our problem . 
  you forgot inhumane and corrupt as shit . 
  so ; first the pro-people ridicule the anti-voters by saying `` lol it is n't even about eu-membership '' . 
  now the news comes out and everyone starts saying : `` of course it 's about membership , what did you expect ? 
  i think i missed that memo that association agreements are a one-way street . 
  we could do the same with association agreements . 
  we do n't need them in the eu for that . 
  you want to deny the facts then ? 
  poland now receives around $ 10b from the eu , while our highest net payer is germany with $ 9b . 
  greece has been with us from 1981 and still cost us $ 4,6 b a year , and that 's excluding the extra financial help we had to send . 
  even the netherlands , who 's considered to be a rich country , `` only '' adds $ 2,2 b to the eu . 
  there is no way one of these countries will be even close to net payers in our lifetimes . 
  yeah , we are totally going to profit from countries like poland , hungary and greece . 
  does n't matter that they cost europe billions per year , just a few more years and we will make bank !, 
  because it 's not true , and you are spewing fact-free nonsense . 
  it 's only 13 % for christians , fyi . 
   can you link this survey ? 
  https://www.wzb.eu/en/press-release/islamic-fundamentalism-is-widely-spread  i regard my love for my boyfriend more important than the laws of my country . 
  am i a criminal ? 
  no , but it 's starts being criminal if those two values start to clash , like discriminating gay or jewish people . 
   how many christians in western europe think the laws in the bible are more important than the laws of their country ? 
  only 13 % . 
   will you prosecute all people who believe their religion to be more important than their nationality ? 
  or will you just single out islam ? 
  not prosecuting for that idea , but their freedom of religion stops at the moment they stop respecting the laws of their country . 
  yeah , we see how that turned out in the usa . 
   it 's relevant here . 
  no , it 's assassination of character . 
  not every person critical of the islam has a swastika on their arm . 
  still , ignoring issues now will put us further on that dark path . 
  you ca n't just disregard every issue with ethnic minorities by comparing it to 1933 . 
  that will only validate the anger of the people , especially if you keep covering for them . 
  sure , we should be careful not going too far of the deep end , but for example trying to sweep example 2000 counts of rape on one single night under the rug , just because the alternative could possibly lead to a new politician that would argue for lebensraum is equally ridiculous . 
   is is such a myth . 
  i 've been hearing that since i was a kid , but it does n't happen . 
   anyway , what happened in london does n't prove what is going to happen in all of europe so , how far are you going to move these goal posts ? 
  it could save us some time to get that out of the way right now . 
  to be fair , we have a new party called denk that took pictures with turkish grey wolves and only right-wing populist media mentioned it . 
  if you read the rest of his comments , it becomes harder and harder to know when he is serious . 
   ur so racist , stupid bigot  oh , really , the race-card again ? 
   lol ur triggered , such thin skin it 's kinda ironic that people get so elitist about their reasonable worldview , they become completely unreasonable . 
  he looks like emperor palpatine . 
  at least in the netherlands nationalising a bank is a temporary solution with the primary goal privatising the bank again as soon as possible , because every day the bank is state property it 's draining funds . 
  this basically turns a `` game-over '' in a soft-reset , lowering the risk of shareholders . 
  the worst part is that during one of our last nationalisations ( fortis bank ) the dutch government did n't buy shares of the company , making it possible for shareholders to profit from tax money injection as their dividend share . 
  but that means a bank is effectively invincible ? 
  if a bank knows they will get bailed out , they can take bigger risks than they usually would , effectively committing fraud with their interest rates . 
  i 'm not saying they should do one way or another , but this `` too big to fail '' - crap with the current banks needs to be stopped . 
  yeah , those wacky federalists believe everything . 
  that 's pizzagate levels of conspiracy theories . 
  also , reports of gunshots coming in . 
  stay safe . 
  it 's funny , because wilders always complains that these so-called `` d66-judges '' are way too lenient in their punishments . 
  it makes his point in two ways though . 
  he is a martyr for free speech , and he showed that the `` d66-judges '' ( in the netherlands , a lot of judges vote for d66 , a political party that thinks reform is more important than punishment ) are way too lenient in their punishments in his eyes . 
   rome was n't build in a day . 
  sure , but i think that even remus and romulus would frown when they realised they invested 5 billion euro and have yet to see a single tavern . 
   individually , lobbyists are n't neutral , of course , but because lobbying happens from all sides , they work out overall neutral . 
  that 's just na\u00efve . 
  big pharma lobby 's are more succesful than poor patient lobby 's , because they have money .
