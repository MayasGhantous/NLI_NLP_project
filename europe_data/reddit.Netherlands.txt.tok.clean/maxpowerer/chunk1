this was widely written about back in april : http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/04/17/novorossiya_is_back_from_the_dead_putin_russia_ukraine, 
  you 're right , it 's been a while since i read about this . 
  let me revise my first point then : the horde under \u00d6gedai had plowed through russia , poland , and hungary with little difficulty , and as the western half of europe was then composed of tiny feuding feudal powers , the horde was likely at the cusp of invading and conquering europe . 
  upon his death the warlords and lesser khans were recalled to deal with a succession crisis that saw the mongol empire ruled by \u00d6gedai 's wife for five years . 
  \u00d6gedai did not die in battle , but died while drinking . 
  he was a renowned alcoholic . 
  in this case the person that stopped the mongol forces from conquering europe was \u00d6gedai himself , together with his love of booze . 
  i will go with some lesser known individuals : 1 . 
  at the time of ghengis khan 's death the golden horde stood at the cusp of invading and most likely conquering europe . 
  at the time of his death , all mongolian forces were ordered to return to mongolia . 
  although the cause of his death is not certain , there seems to be some consensus around the idea that he died from an arrow wound in battle . 
  that anonymous archer may have singlehandedly altered the course of history in europe more drastically than any other individual in the last 1000 years . 
  on a similar note , it is said that the black plague first entered europe in 1340 when a mongolian force catapulted the corpse of some poor plague victim over the battlements into genoa . 
  within 3 centuries , one third of the population of europe was dead . 
  that flying corpse changed things quite a bit . 
  in 1983 , stanislav petrov singlehandedly prevented a nuclear holocaust when the soviet early warning system detected a false alert . 
  thousands of warheads pointed at europe would have been otherwise been set off . 
  whoever had the final say in the board of admissions at the art academy of vienna in 1907 and 1908 . 
  and marco polo , since nobody mentioned him yet , and his tales of riches in the east helped set in motion the building up of naval powers , the age of exploration , and the whole project of colonialism .

  were n't the german crusaders your enemies 850 years ago ? 
  not even eurovision . 
  they let australia in last time , for fuck 's sake . 
  i believe this is because of the dublin protocol , which states that migrants can only apply for refugee status in the first country in which they arrive/make themselves known to the authorities as refugees . 
  they are all trying to get to germany and other western european countries , and they all know about this rule , that 's why they do n't report themselves to greek or hungarian authorities . 
  i believe they think that if they accept the food or water that it legally implies that they are declaring themselves as refugees to the police , and thus negating any chance of doing this in other countries later . 
  essentially , they think the hungarians are trying to trick them , and if they accept their help they will never make it to their destination or be allowed to settle in the wealthier countries . 
  that 's also why they seem angry . 
  also , because germany has accepted so many migrants already , there is a good chance that some of the people going there now are reuniting with family members and taking advantage of these family members having a head start on life in europe, 
  the concept of universal human rights is a western concept , and not universal . 
  i think one of the reasons this is a common practice is because it 's something that 's probably been re-invented many times . 
  turning a flag upside down is an easy way to show disrespect or disagreement with that flag , or symbolize `` you 've turned this country upside down ! '', 
  i do n't think you have to be too clever to think of that yourself , even if you 've never heard of a distress signal .

  in 1664 , during the 2nd anglo-dutch war , the english invaded nieuw amsterdam and it became new york . 
  the dutch countered by invading suriname . 
  in 1667 the treaty of breda was signed . 
  not knowing that there was peace yet , the english retook suriname . 
  afterwards the colonial possessions were restored to what they were at the time of the signing of the treaty , so suriname returned to the netherlands and new york remained english . 
  but wait , there 's more !, 
  in 1673 , during the 3rd anglo-dutch war , a small fleet operating under the authority of admiral cornelis evertsen the youngest ( keesje de duivel ) invaded and occupied new york , appointing captain anthonij colve as the governor of the colony . 
  new york was renamed new orange ( because evertsen and colve were from zeeland and did n't want to glorify holland by using the name ` nieuw amsterdam ' again ) , and this was indeed the only successful occupation of any american colony by anyone except the english . 
  it was returned to the english and renamed new york in 1674 under the terms of the second peace treaty of westminster .
