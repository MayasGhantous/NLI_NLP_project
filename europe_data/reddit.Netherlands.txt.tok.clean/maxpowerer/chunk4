  add red wine , thyme , rosemary , bay leaves . 
  pour this mixture over the ribs in the pan . 
  seal and bake at 250 for 2.5 hours . 
  meanwhile , cook white polenta with milk , butter , and cheese . 
  serve the rib on top of the polenta , and garnish with pressed raw garlic , lemon zest , and parsley mixed with olive oil , salt and pepper . 
  next day , leftover meat is mixed with salad greens , shredded carrot , and served in a tortilla as a taco . 
  one unique peculiarity of the dutch healthcare system is that they rarely give you painkillers when you are in pain ( even after minor surgeries and such ) , or if they do , they are weak and there are few of them . 
  they often just tell you to take an ibuprofen for whatever pain you have . 
  i suspect this is more to do with staunch calvinist tradition than modern healthcare rules , and i think it would be the same if everything was totally privatized .

  did you get hit by a fracking-induced earthquake as you typed that last bit ? 
  you must have mentioned it at the last meeting .

  wow , you even marked the locations of all the houses, 
  excellent potato quality, 
  they also built a fucking road on the sea in big floodistan , it 's pretty tight, 
  yeah , you know , crazy frisians , turn your back for one second and [ bam ] ( http://www.groepfanauwerk.com/ynterfryske%20kaart%202010.jpg ) , they 'll annex anything between here and denmark that 's not nailed down .

   it is not a great idea to carry a plank of wood down a busy sidewalk . 
  ** nor should you ride a horse while drunk ** , or handle a salmon under suspicious circumstances . 
  but should such antics be illegal ? 
  still ? 
  wtf , yes , such antics should be illegal , riding a horse while drunk sounds like a terrible idea . 
  it 's like driving in a car , except requires more specific training , a sense of balance that is impaired by alcohol , and involves an animal that is 10 times your size and can kick straight through your skull . 
  if they make it to england , they 're no longer in france . 
  sounds pretty nice , if you 're french .

  would you prefer to have hitler in charge over merkel ?

  `` regen '' means `` rain , '' and it 's raining right now . 
  the city looks practically the same as in the film , even the colors are pretty much the same on such a dark winter day .

  great ... 
  a better engineered , more efficient kebab . 
   pussy police `` drop your panties !,

   appearing before her supporters , ms. 
  le pen called it a `` magnificent '' result , saying the national front was `` the only party that can reconquer the lost territories of the republic , of calais , where we won 50 percent of the votes , or of the suburbs , '' she said . . '' sounds metaphorical to me . 
  i 'm no . 
  the benelux , germany , and austria ? 
  why not the western edge of poland too ? 
  and a little bit of the czech republic ? 
  eh , i guess that is some kind of progress ? 
  today they respect 10 , maybe tomorrow it will be 11 . 
  though actually the comments are people saying all gays should be respected and the article 's author is an idiot . 
  i see opinions of russians have not changed at all . 
  also , the french die in war and the germans die in wine ?!, 
  those open-hearted germans and their wine ... 
  when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature 's god entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the removal of kebab . 
  and i 'm sure the turks and the kurds will have no problem cooperating . 
  `` ok , it looks like you 've been approved for residency in sweden , congratu ... april fools !,

  they 're not terrorists , they 're arms smugglers !, 
  they 're not trying to kill innocent people , they 're just selling weapons to people who use guns for illegal purposes .

  but yeah , anyway , not terrorists , just misunderstood businessmen ( who murder the police with assault rifles ) . 
  i like that they named it leopold [ and deployed it in africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgian_frigate_leopold_i_ ( f930 ) \uff08 \u00b4 _ \u2283 \uff40 \uff09, 
  the problem is that all these groups are lumped together in the media as `` kurds '' and not only think of the positive things they 've heard about other kurdish groups , but also feel sympathy the kurds because they are seen by outsiders as a persecuted minority ethnic group in turkey . 
  and everyone knows how it ended last time the turks persecuted an ethnic minority . 
  well i 'm sure he would n't have worn it had he known that .

  it 's nice to see some mythology explored besides the standard greco-roman or norse stories .

  hmm , indeed . 
   most notable were their contribution to local toponymy and anthroponymy , as personal names borne by the sueves were in use among galicians up to the low middle ages , while east germanic names in general were most common among locals during the high middle ages . 
  from these names is derived also a rich toponymy , found mainly in galicia and northern portugal , and made up of several thousand place names derived directly from germanic personal names , expressed as germanic or latin genitives : sandi\u00e1s , medieval sindilanes , germanic genitive form of the name sindila ; mondariz from the latin genitive form munderici munderic 's ; gondomar from gundemari and baltar from baltarii , both in portugal and galicia ; guitiriz to witterici . 
  another group of toponyms which point to old germanic settlements are the places named sa , saa , sas , in galicia , or s\u00e1 in portugal , all derived from the germanic word * sal - ` house , hall ' , and distributed mostly around braga and porto in portugal , and in the minho river valley and around lugo in galicia , totalling more than a hundred . 
  in modern galicia , four parishes and six towns and villages are still named suevos or suegos , from the medieval form suevos , all of them from the latin sueuos ` sueves ' , and referring to old suevi settlements . 
  `` guys , stop the boat , let me off .
