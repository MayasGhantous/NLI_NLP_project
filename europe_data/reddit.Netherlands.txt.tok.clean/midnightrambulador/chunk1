i read that as `` christian orthodox state of dumbass '' at first . 
  fitting . 
  patience , my friend ... patience . 
  danmag removing kebab and gefilte fish from premises ? 
  when i saw this on my front page , i first thought this was a post on / r/thenetherlands . 
  but lo and behold , lady europa is noticing us !, 
  poland is secretly the most tolerant nation of europe . 
  in the uk , bigotry has always been overridden by omg hawt lesbians . 
  the [ strahov stadium ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strahov_stadium ) puts all of them to shame . 
   when it was an active sports venue , it had a capacity of around ** 250,000 ** , making it the largest stadium in the world . 
  part of me wants sparta prague to renovate it and start actually using it as their home ground . 
  sure , they 'd never fill the place , but how awesome would it be to be able to say , `` our stadium seats 250,000 people '' ? 
  call it london . 
  sure , the republicans will hate it at first , but watch how quickly their tune changes when the money from confused tourists and bankers starts streaming in . 
  i 'd count spain and italy as well , but not a whole lot beyond that . 
  i never said * we * were . 
  neither of us has qualified for `` major european country '' status since sometime in the 18th century . 
   sweden 's new center-left government will recognise the state of palestine in a move that will make it the first major european country to take the step , prime minister stefan lofven said on friday . 
   sweden  *** major european country *** my sides, 
  italian trains , huh ? 
  [ i can sympathise . 
  we love to argue about beer in the netherlands but ( almost ) everyone agrees that bavaria is the worst beer ever . 
  i shudder to think what the exported version must taste like . 
  i did a blind test with grolsch and hj once , it was very easy to taste the difference . 
  i do n't think heineken would be much more difficult . 
  would be interesting to correct it for alcohol percentage : `` litres of alcohol ( from beer ) per capita per year '' . 
  german beer for example tends to be very light ( possibly explaining germany 's high score ) , whereas belgians drink a lot of fancy heavy beer . 
  heineken is dishwater . 
  try hertog jan for a good dutch beer . 
  i did a sizeable chunk of the rhine route this summer . 
  beautiful !, 
  the map sure puts amsterdam far to the north , by the way ... 
  got ta love the italian preparations : `` donkeys inspected for war . '', 
  also , the creator of this map must have been feeling particularly sarcastic when he noted the dardanelles had been `` made famous by winston churchill '' . 
  of course . 
  but it just seems like an extremely petty and backwards thing to do . 
  parading captured enemies through the streets ... ? 
  what year is this , 1600 ? 
  we 'll use zeppelins for that part . 
  yeah , he would be terrified of anything involving rainbows . 
  he 'd run crying to his mommy about `` gay propaganda '' :d, 
  so am i , but i do n't think maastricht is important enough for high-speed rail . 
  amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague , utrecht , yes ; eindhoven , * maybe * ; but maastricht ? 
  seriously ? 
  that 's part of the sanctions . 
  great video , only the accent ruined it for me . 
  he sounds like lt. aldo raine from * inglourious basterds * . 
  do n't be fooled , they 're secretly preparing for a new stormaktstiden . 
  sabaton is actually a resistance group trying to warn us of their government 's plans . 
  i went there with my mum and stepdad when i was ... 9 ? 
  it was good fun . 
  [ obviously i 'm not as well-travelled as i like to think ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jxvzmdj.png ) . 
  especially seeing how much of germany i 've never visited came as a bit of a shock . 
  my travel plans for next year include eastern germany and the czech republic . 
   reality has brought at least * some * humbleness to our government/media . 
  the way i see it , we 're just replacing one unrealistic approach ( '' [ come to us all who are heavily laden ] ( http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/matthew-11-28/ ) , there 's room for everyone ! '' ), 
  with another ( `` hey , let 's create some magical safe spaces in the poor/unstable/oppressed regions these people were fleeing from in the first place , then they 'll stop coming here and they wo n't be our problem anymore ! '' ), 
  short of machine-gunning everyone who tries to get in , there are no easy ways out of this . 
  even denmark . 
  which of course have nothing to do with the sudden influx of russian tourists to the eastern ukraine . 
  * internal * disputes ? 
  think again . 
  19th century ? 
  most feudal , authoritarian and generally backwards country of europe . 
  20th century ? 
  stalin , and even after his death , four more decades of dictatorship and brutal oppression of the eastern european countries . 
  censorship , massive corruption , murders of journalists , and oh hey let 's start harrassing the ukraine again . 
  show me one place and time where anything remotely democratic has flourished under russian rule , anything that did n't have to be held together with truncheons and jackboots . 
  but the knives would have little fold-out guns on them, 
  downputin 'd, 
  i 'm not sure . 
  they might , if they tried . 
  the swiss are dangerous people . 
  if the swiss had run the show there would n't be a single jew left alive today . 
  or the stab-in-the-back legend . 
  * and when you gaze for too long into / r/mensrights , / r/mensrights gazes also into you . 
  no russia , you tried to help serbia before , it did n't go well . 
   if you visit poland you will see overwhelming majority of people that look slavic so , lots of tracksuits ? 
   although the new coin will be legal tender in germany , it will probably barely be used for that purpose . 
  rather , the target demographic are collectors and prospective collectors . 
  huber : ` this modern coin should particularly garner interest among young people . ', 
  so basically , the whole thing is a desperate attempt to draw young people into some obscure hobby ? 
  what 's next , eu-funded model trains ? 
  ( also , the header about `` ten years of research '' reminds me of the song about [ the mad professor who spent thirteen years developing a new letter for the german alphabet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ixgxbvttge ) . ), 
  within two weeks everyone starts murdering dolphins because they believe wading in the blood will make them geniuses . 
   russia 's interior ministry told reporters this week the average bribe may have doubled from around 109,000 rubles last year to 208,000 today . 
  in dollars , that increase is nowhere nearly as high : a little over $ 3,050 in 2014 vs. $ 3,400 now . 
  but in rubles , it is n't pretty . 
  wait , how does that work exactly ? 
  is there some funky non-linear exchange rate at work here ? 
  well , look at it this way -- would you really want * reddit * to decide instead ? 
  well , his scandinavia is pretty far off too ... 
  i 'm with dawkins on this one . 
  i 'm no fan of the sweden democrats or similar parties , but a gay pride march through a muslim-majority neighbourhood does n't sound like a bad idea -- both as moral support for gays within the muslim community , and to gauge the reactions in general . 
  then again , if people deliberately came to my neighbourhood waving banners and chanting slogans just to see if i was outraged by it , i 'd probably be all ` wtf , leave me alone . ', 
  the nicest approach would be to get local gay circles involved and really make it a thing * by * the local community rather than a bunch of outsiders shouting * at * the community . 
  which obviously is n't what the sweden democrats are planning . 
  huh , you learn something new every day . 
  edited my post . 
   ** gordon ramsay ** , 40 , from invergordon , said six to eight frenchmen grappled with him and tried to forcefully seize his documents before ruining the fish .
