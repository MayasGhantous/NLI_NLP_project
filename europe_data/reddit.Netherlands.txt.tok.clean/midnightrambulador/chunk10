  a europe that properly coordinates its own transition to a sustainable economy . 
  a europe that sets aside petty local squabbles for the sake of a common cause -- and encourages its brightest minds to make a career out of serving that cause . 
  one great big oasis of peace , prosperity , freedom and good governance , encompassing 600 million people or more , making them proud to be imperial citizens -- proud to be europeans . 
  a man can dream . 
  the last 10-15 years , we 've seen a rise in anti-eu sentiment in all the western member states , but it seems like britain has been reluctant towards the european project ever since it joined : always asking for an exception on this or an opt-out on that , always intensely suspicious of the `` ever closer union '' . 
  also , where in other countries `` anti-eu '' is more or less synonymous with `` anti-establishment '' , in britain euroskepticism reaches to the top of the political elite , as can be seen quite clearly with prominent conservative politicians campaigning for a brexit . 
  in no other european country would the prime minister have to promise a referendum on leaving the eu in order to keep his own party together . 
  ( and for some anecdotal evidence , i ca n't help but notice that the most stridently euroskeptic comments on / r/europe are often from users with british flairs . ), 
  so , i guess what i 'm asking is -- why always britain ? 
  why is it britain that has always been reluctant about european integration and is now even going to vote on leaving the eu , and not france or sweden or austria ? 
  is it just a cultural thing ? 
  ( also published as a blog post [ here ] ( https://bismarx.wordpress.com/2016/06/23/thoughts-on-the-morning-of-the-brexit-vote/ ) ) *** * we march to victory , or we march to defeat . 
  but we go forward . 
  only forward . 
  * -- stannis baratheon , * game of thrones * ** i ** the brexit referendum is finally upon us , and the thought of a `` leave '' victory really scares me . 
  if we lose britain , we lose our second-largest economy and military -- but the psychological fallout would be even worse . 
  so far , the european project has always had a sense of unstoppability about it : slowly as it may roll , there are no brakes on the european train , and certainly no reverse gear . 
  when that aura shatters , when it becomes clear that european integration is reversible -- on the retreat , even -- that will be a huge morale boost to anti-eu forces everywhere : these past few weeks i 've heard the words `` nexit '' , `` frexit '' , `` swexit '' , `` dexit '' and even `` czexit '' floated a few times more than i 'm comfortable with . 
  a brexit would weaken europe , not only materially but also morally , to such an extent that any hopes of europe setting its own course in the world will be crushed for the next 50 years , if not longer . 
  ( not even a 3-0 loss against wales will be able to wipe the smirk off vladimir putin 's face . ), 
  as for the brits themselves , the idea that they have anything to gain from a brexit is based on a delusional view of how much power they can still project on their own -- [ which is apparently somewhat of a chronic disease for them . 
  ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/eu-uk-referendum-brexit-campaign-is-a-battle-for-the-past-as-well-as-the-future-history/ ) however , i will say this for the brexit referendum : it 's a legitimate question to put to a vote . 
  we ca n't very well * force * any country to join the eu or to stay in it . 
  if britain really wants out , out it goes . 
  i ca n't say the same for another recent referendum -- the dutch vote on the eu-ukraine association agreement . 
  needless to say , i cast my vote in favour , but it seemed quite silly that we dutch voters should get to decide this at all . 
  and i mean , we technically did n't : the referendum was explicitly an advisory one , and our parliament is free to ignore the outcome entirely and ratify the agreement anyway ( which i 'm afraid they wo n't have the guts to do ) . 
  but hang on a minute -- why should the * dutch * parliament have anything to say about an * eu * treaty ? 
  suppose germany signs a treaty with some other country -- say , mexico -- and a bunch of people in one of its federal states -- say , saxony -- hold a referendum about the treaty and reject it . 
  the landtag of saxony follows this decision and refuses to ratify the treaty . 
  would n't the bundestag then tell the landtag of saxony to get stuffed ? 
  federal states do n't make foreign policy in germany , only the national government does . 
  ** ii ** go up one layer , to the european union , and this basic logic -- different powers for different tiers of government -- no longer applies . 
  the curious fact that a handful of dutch malcontents can hold eu decisions to ransom is just one symptom of the eu 's most fundamental problem : particularism . 
  particularism basically means `` putting the interests of a part ahead of the interests of the whole '' . 
  it 's one of the problems that ended the dutch golden age : because almost everyone in the governing elite was only out to get the best deal for their town or region , and there was no central government that could overrule these squabbling city bosses , coherent policymaking for the dutch republic as a whole was next to impossible . 
  particularism runs rampant in brussels today , and the way european institutions are set up only encourages it . 
  not only do eu treaties need the approval of national parliaments besides that of the european parliament ( whereas even in the loosest federations , foreign policy and defence are the two policy areas that fall to the central government ) . 
  two much bigger flaws are the existence of the council of ministers as a legislative power alongside the european parliament ; and the fact that the same european parliament is composed of `` delegations '' elected separately by each member state ( instead of a single europe-wide election where the same candidates are on the ballot everywhere ) . 
  fix these two design flaws , and you 'd ease a lot of the eu 's biggest troubles . 
  ** iii ** first and foremost , the `` democratic deficit '' would vanish . 
  anti-eu campaigners have a point when they call the eu `` undemocratic '' : in the council , ministers from national governments -- most of whom are n't elected -- decide on eu legislation . 
  these ministers form the executive branch of government in their home countries , so this legislative role violates separation of powers . 
  cut the council out of the loop , and the eu ( finally ) becomes a normal democracy . 
  then there 's the matter of actual policy , which , in the current particularist setup , is all too often a fractured mess . 
  one retired legal translator [ ( link in dutch ) ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/vonk/-meneer-dit-is-iets-dat-u-niet-begrijpt-dit-is-politiek~a3581933/ ) complained that ` texts coming from the commission are often reasonably coherent . 
  it 's in the negotiations between member states where they fall to pieces . ', 
  every one of the twenty-eight member states wants to see their own touch in the final text -- something the ambassadors and ministers can proudly show to their colleagues at home : * look , we got the czech/italian/irish viewpoint in there !, 
  * this leads to bloated and often outright contradictory legislation . 
  budgeting is no better -- european court of auditors member alex brenninkmeijer summed up member states ' attitudes on eu money as ` better poorly spent in our country than well spent elsewhere . ', 
  and what about brussels 's legendary near-total absence from the mental universes of ordinary europeans ? 
  well , might that have something to do with the fact that we 've never had truly european elections ? 
  european parliament elections are separated by country . 
  the campaigns are run by national parties ; the candidates are figures from national politics . 
  change that , put the same names on the ballots everywhere , and you force the creation of a truly integrated european political class , one which will have to campaign for votes and reach out to voters all across europe -- something generations of brussels politicians have failed to do . 
  except for diehard brussels watchers , nobody has heard of european `` parties '' like alde or the epp or the socialists & democrats ; that will change when these parties are on our ballots and campaigning for our votes , instead of venstre or the cdu or the parti socialiste . 
  an end to the particularist setup would also make the union more robust against shocks coming from a single country . 
  remember when greece accounted for ' 2 % of european gdp but 98 % of european meetings ' ? 
  if the dutch province of limburg turned out to have been lying about its finances for years , that would hardly pose an existential threat to the netherlands as a country . 
  oh , and while we 're at it , we could cut the european commission from its current ridiculous size ( twenty-eight ! ), 
  to a more practical number -- say , ten or twelve commissioners . 
  can you imagine how bloated the french cabinet would be if there had to be a minister from each department ? 
  ** iv ** the end goal must be a federal republic of europe , on the german model ( there admittedly is n't much of a case for calling it `` imperial europe '' , [ as i proposed earlier , ] ( https://bismarx.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/europe-visions-of-empire/ ) beyond `` it would be , like , * totally awesome * '' ) . 
  the member states as we know them now will remain a relevant layer of government , with the final say in a range of policy areas such as education , health care , policing , taxation and public transport -- but decisions taken on a european level must be taken * by the european parliament * ; what the parliaments and governments of slovakia , portugal or the netherlands think about it does n't matter . 
  by this point anyone with a more pragmatic mindset will have told me a dozen times that this is all well and good , but it 's not `` politically feasible '' . 
  and sure enough , it 's a rotten time for plans like these ; we 've let the undemocratic , uninspiring version of the european union plod on for so long that ordinary europeans ' indifference to the project has turned into outright hostility in many circles . 
  but the defeatism in the pro-european camp is a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  politicians who are pro-eu on paper refuse to defend the union with any shred of passion , because they fear too enthusiastic support for `` brussels '' will run against widespread anti-eu sentiment and cost them votes . 
  ( in the run-up to the dutch ukraine referendum , all the moderate dutch parties were in favour of the treaty , but only one of them campaigned for a yes vote with any sort of conviction . ), 
  but how are these anti-eu sentiments ever supposed to * change * if no one is telling any positive stories about europe , at least not at a volume exceeding a half-hearted mumble ? 
  pro-european politicians need to show backbone instead of meekly swaying with the breeze of populist rage . 
  clearly say what you want with europe and why , and stand for it ; that will win you a lot more respect than the current politics of appeasement . 
  the crucial arguments for european integration are barely heard in any debate beyond a tiny circle of enthusiastic europhiles . 
  screw the hazy calculations about economic growth ; let 's talk about how much more coordinated european energy policy needs to be if we want to secure a reliable energy supply in the future . 
  about why we need military cooperation to guarantee our security in an unstable world -- something we ca n't leave to the americans forever . 
  about why the solution to the migrant crisis is effective control of the external border , not the return of internal ones . 
  about the fact that britain , germany or france -- let alone belgium or latvia -- will never be taken as seriously in washington , moscow and beijing as a united europe would . 
  and let 's build an effective , democratic european union to achieve those goals -- hopefully with britain . 
  ( also published as a blog post [ here ] ( https://bismarx.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/notes-on-islam-and-notes-on-europe/ ) ) ** i ** is islam compatible with european culture ? 
  it 's a question that has obsessed european political life for the past fifteen years , and not one to which it 's easy to find a straightforward answer . 
  can you live as a practising muslim and a well-integrated member of european society at the same time ? 
  i do n't know ; i 've never taken much of an interest in islamic theology , and i could n't cite a quran verse if you held me at gunpoint ( so if i ever fall into the hands of isis or al shabaab , i 'm doomed ) . 
  it probably depends on which imam you ask -- revealed truths have a habit of being open to interpretation . 
  i do , however , know a few things that definitely * are n't * compatible with european culture : 1 . 
  the idea that a woman is under the guardianship of her husband , father or brother , rather than a free human being who makes her own choices . 
  a social code which greatly constrains individual freedom in the name of `` family honour '' . 
  rejection of homosexuality . 
  claiming an untouchable place in the public sphere for any religion . 
  a sexual morality which holds that women must cover themselves when they leave their homes , because men are horny beasts who wo n't be able to control themselves otherwise . 
  the question , then , could be rephrased as : to what extent can these [ `` touches of medieval darkness '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy_s66kxzxm ) be separated from islam ? 
  i am reminded of an interview with two female , reformist members of saudi arabia 's shura council , the closest thing the country has to a parliament [ ( link in dutch and , unfortunately , behind a paywall ) ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/buitenland/-kies-je-gevecht-de-rest-komt-wel~a4317964/ ) . 
  they point out that the most reactionary elements in saudi society come not from islam but from a tribal culture that long predates it , and actually use `` society should be based on islam '' as an argument for * less * conservative policies . 
  but in the european context , whether or not these elements have anything to do with islam on paper is a largely philosophical distinction ; the point is that they often come bundled with it in practice . 
  ** ii ** islamic or un-islamic , whenever arabic tribal culture rears its ugly head in europe , the response from institutions -- schools , social workers , police -- is often less steadfast than one might hope . 
  the furious rhetoric of the populist right dominates the political debate , but `` in the field '' we often see the opposite problem . 
  consider the case of the syrian family living in switzerland , whose two teenage sons refused to shake their female teachers ' hands . 
  [ the family 's swiss citizenship procedure was suspended , ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/19/switzerland-suspends-citizenship-process-muslim-family ) and rightly so , but only after a media storm provoked the interference of the federal government ; initially the school had found a workaround by requesting the boys not shake their * male * teachers ' hands either . 
  * i do n't want to shake a woman 's hand . 
  i do n't want my child to learn about homosexuality in school . 
  i do n't want a male doctor to treat my wife .
