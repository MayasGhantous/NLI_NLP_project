  i ca n't say i 'm too happy about this crosspost ; i was thinking of posting it to / r/europe myself . 
  of course , i should have done that sooner if i did n't want someone else to beat me to it , and it 's not like there 's a rule against crossposting other people 's posts , but still . 
  next time it would be nice to ask permission before crossposting someone else 's oc .

  he 's right , of course . 
  however , he fails to address one important problem . 
  mass immigration will raise more problems than it solves , unless these immigrants : 1 . learn the language of their new country ; 2 . have or learn some useful skill that 's in real demand on the labour market ( he specifically mentions `` high-skilled workers '' ) ; 3 . accept some basic cultural norms of their new country . 
  if these conditions are n't met , you 're importing people who wo n't be productive members of society , but only -- to put it bluntly -- cost money and cause trouble . 
  however , making sure they * are * met will require billions of euros of taxpayers ' money as well as a staggering bureaucratic effort : language courses , screening procedures , etc. , etc.

  everyone from germany to poland to the ukraine would rejoice . 
  yeah , this one 's obvious . 
  i would also switch places with friedrich ebert during the 1918 - '19 revolution and , y' know , maybe * not * give my greatest enemies ( freikorps , basically proto-nazis ) weapons to shoot at my own supporters ( working-class social democrats ) . 
  really , if the spd leadership had n't stabbed themselves in the back in the stupidest way possible back then , things could have gone so very differently for germany . 
  no weimar republic , no 3rd reich , no wwii , no ddr ... 
  chamberlain 's policy of appeasement is usually portrayed as either spineless or stupid , but in fact it was a deliberate strategy . 
  he reasoned that britain did n't have the resources to hold onto her empire * and * fight a war in europe ( which proved entirely correct when the empire fell apart after 1945 ) . 
  hence he threw germany some bones -- sorry czechoslovakia -- in the hopes that hitler would be satisfied and leave it at that . 
  unfortunately , hitler 's ambitions reached much further ; he wanted to turn germany into a superpower of a size that would have been completely unacceptable for britain . 
  hence appeasement failed . 
  not as awkward and delicate as you 'd think . 
  the relentless persecution and eventual extermination of jews was a unique obsession of hitler and a small clique around him ; it went far beyond what even the most rabid anti-semites in germany had advocated before 1933 . 
  as historian sebastian haffner wrote : ` even without hitler , there would probably have been some kind of dictatorial state after 1933 ; even without hitler , there would probably have been a second war ; but not a million-fold massacre of jews . ', 
  so yeah . 
  if you 'd put someone else in hitler 's place , that person would probably have little difficulty in halting or strongly toning down the anti-semitic measures . 
  well , # 14 and # 22 are accurate ...
