  jan de quay , prime minister from 1959 to 1963 . 
  i 'd have established a fund for the natural gas revenues from the groningen field -- like norway did with its oil money -- rather than just spending it all directly as it came in . 
  we 'd be super-rich now , and we 'd be able to cut back the gas extraction ( as is necessary now because of earthquakes , and will be * more * necessary in the future as the field runs out ) without creating immediate budgetary problems . 
  his request was denied because ` voting for yourself is poor sportsmanship , ' according to council officials . 
  i meant reddit 's `` new message '' symbol , the little orange envelope . 
  tsjek orange l\u00e4tters .

  i do n't think russia has much to fear . 
  the americans ca n't even occupy wall street . 
  first the armenian genocide recognition , now this . 
  francis is on a roll . 
  so ... spain is actually taking much * fewer * refugees than it would have to under a `` fair '' system , and italy and greece are more or less meeting the quotum ? 
  so far , any talk i 've heard of a `` fairer distribution '' seemed to be aimed at decreasing the burden on spain , italy and greece . 
  that 's all well and good , but we 're never going to build up europe as a superpower without a credible military force , and we 're never going to get that without germany taking the lead . 
  with attitudes like these , we 're pretty much doomed to remain a collection of bumbling american vassals forever . 
   `` eu is not tough enough with russia on ukraine '' : 26 %  `` germany should play a more active military role '' : 25 % goddammit germany ... get over your stockholm syndrome already . 
  i remember a video of a `` dj '' just moving to the beat behind his panel of buttons , and occasionally pretending to twist a knob without actually touching it . 
  a european equivalent to the american trope of `` stuff built on ancient indian burial grounds '' . 
  did a wizened old jewish grandmother appear and curse the lithuanian power grid for all time ? 
  1667 was an excellent year . 
   tfw meme circles get posted outside of the meme circle sub by a meme circle mod, 
  can we ask you anything ? 
  i parsed ` brexit ' as ' * brazilian * exit ' rather than ` british exit ' for a moment . 
  i wonder what this says about me . 
  he 's like a younger version of berlusconi . 
  i 'm 100 % with the ukraine in this conflict , and i have nothing but hate for russia and its puppets , but i do n't like the tone of the comments here . 
  yes , this man is a sick fuck . 
  there are many sick fucks fighting with the separatists . 
  there are many sick fucks fighting in the ukrainian army as well . 
  do n't get me wrong , it 's great that this kind of journalism is being done and that these things are reported on . 
  but to stand here and collectively voice outrage at these kinds of horror stories ( `` see , the other side really is terrible ! '' ), 
  seems a bit shallow and na\u00efve . 
  what are we , americans ? 
  so , how does one become president of finland ? 
  and is it the kind of presidency with actual political power ( e.g. 
  france , usa ) or more of a `` cool old guy in residence '' job ( e.g. 
  germany , italy ) ? 
  disgusting but not much of a surprise , really . 
  reminds me of the comintern days when moscow dictated the policies of a bunch of communist parties . 
  actually that might be a good analogy to use against the fn in debates . 
  french redditors , how do le pen c.s. 
  feel about communists ? 
  i 'm sure they wo n't like being compared to those guys . 
  what 's that dense string of sites on the french-belgian border ? 
  my first thought was that it would be ww1-related , but it does n't seem to match the frontline very well . 
  they 've gotten sloppy because they build everything with lego . 
  fake-fake ... 
  does this remind anyone else of the thing with pofalla , db and der postillon ? 
  and russia is n't ? 
   anti-habsburg alliance always a good thing . 
  til russia is in the `` council of europe '' ( but belarus is n't ),

  in less masculine countries ( such as my own ) , these symbols on the side of a tram would probably mean something along the lines of `` look , thanks to this tram we 're cutting 4 cars ' worth of carbon dioxide emissions ! '', 
  of course , even the fucking * trams * have dashcam ... 
  i paused laibach for that video ... 
  somehow i do n't hear much of a difference . 
  they 're probably a bit ... * flexible * on the `` without accidents '' part . 
  after all , the land of the glorious leader loves to make things look more glorious than they really are .

   ( 1 ) whosoever publicly , in a meeting or through the dissemination of written materials ( section11 ( 3 ) )  1 . insults or maliciously expresses contempt of the federal republic of germany ** or one of its states ** or its constitutional order ; or  2 . insults the colours , flag , coat of arms or the anthem of the federal republic of germany or one of its states shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding three years or a fine . 
  if they 're going to fine everyone who has ever insulted bavaria , they 'll have enough money to fix every road , bridge and railway in germany -- and then some . 
  i remember reading that it 's illegal in germany to call the flag `` black-red-yellow '' rather than `` black-red-gold '' , because it 's associated with nazi sneers at the flag during the weimar era . 
  do you know if this is true ?

  * i 'd find it beautifully symbolic if we had a second battle of poltava , except marking the end rather than the beginning of russian power . 
  where is that from ? 
   jokes aside , i really hope the eu will man up and turn itself into a true world superpower , instead of being america 's sidekick . 
  always nice to hear someone who agrees with you on this point :d we should have a subreddit or something . 
  ( and no , i do n't mean / r/yurop . ), 
  it would be amusing if the serbian units became the most feared in the european army , similar to the gurkhas in the current british army . 
  though , they might have to compete with the finns for that status ... 
  inb4 he turns out to be a golden dawn member,

  just want to note that this is the first time i see someone actually use `` czechia '' outside of discussions of the name change itself . 
  ... yeah , ok , my bad . 
  i should have thought those last two comments through for a few minutes before hitting `` save '' -- then i 'd realised that it 's silly to point a finn at other countries ' experiences with russia because you guys have plenty of your own . 
  and also that i know way too little about finnish history ( something i plan to remedy eventually ) to have an informed discussion on that point . 
  forgive me .
