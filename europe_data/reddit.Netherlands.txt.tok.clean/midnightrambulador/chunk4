  / u/maxbiggavelli wants you to know that he created / r/argrd for this purpose . 
  like , * [ really ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qonzl7p.png ) * wants you to know . 
  \\  implying there are poor people in finland, 
   such is life in / r/europe . 
  all through the album i was waiting for the depression joke . 
  the title just sounded too much like `` a normal day in [ country x ] '' which is always applied to bizarre , stereotype-confirming pictures from that country . 
  but no , it actually * is * a regular guy 's regular saturday in finland . 
  or geenstijl , as we saw in our ukraine referendum ... 
  source ? 
  i find this very hard to believe - health care and social security are such a huge portion of any european government 's budget ... and `` migration and integration '' can be defined as widely or narrowly as you like . 
   we 've never civil wars you accidentally a [ huge history mistake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_civil_war ), 
  oh look , this overblown propaganda piece came from an hour-old account * what a surprise * . 
  forgive me if i do n't take your `` analysis '' entirely seriously . 
  that does n't sound very plausible to me . 
  they did have a puritan dictatorship under cromwell ... 
  somehow i find this an unsatisfying explanation . 
  we 're sitting on the largest gas field in europe , and we 've traditionally been quite enthusiastic forerunners of european integration . 
  disagree . 
  threats have never made anyone any friends . 
  remember that the scottish independence referendum was heading for an overwhelming no for a long time , and the yes camp only closed the gap in the polls after westminster politicians started making threats about how an independent scotland would suffer . 
  moscow quite openly * opposes * europe , on the political , cultural and -- in the ukrainian conflict -- military fronts . 
  ( really , since the revolution in 1917 russia has stopped even trying to pretend it 's a european country . ), 
  the continued russian occupation of k\u00f6nigsberg is an unfortunate historical accident . 
  what 's a photo from russia doing in a compilation of * european * villages ? 
  population of estonia : 1.3 m population of latvia : 2.0 m population of lithuania : 2.9 m if we 're going to make provinces * that * small we 'd need 200 + provinces to cover all of europe . 
  we simply disagree on this point , then . 
  i 'm against single-issue parties , and having 16 ( ! ), 
  different parties in parliament like we do now is just a godawful mess to me . 
  ( to be fair , that 's not only caused by the lack of a voting threshold , but also by the ability to take your seat with you when you leave your party , even when you only got in because you were on the party list -- a serious bug in our constitution . ), 
  we 've seen the past 3-4 years how complicated governing becomes when everyone and their mother has to be courted for support . 
  in parliament , i want to see large , professionally organised parties with a commitment to serious policy-making , not the latest opportunistic project from some hero brinkman or jan nagel , nor single-issue wonks like the pvdd . 
  * yeah , and ? 
  i 've never seen the point in promoting languages that have no standardised written form and are only spoken by a handful of greying farmers . 
  i 'm more a fan of standardised forms that can be used for serious intellectual discourse ( like your * hochdeutsch * or our * algemeen beschaafd nederlands * ) . 
  * this is exactly why these prefecture borders would n't work so well in practice ; they 're meant more as an interesting thought experiment . 
  a more practical way to even out province sizes would probably be to just carve up the largest countries . 
  * god no . 
  creating a unified political class at the european level is the entire point of this plan ( the counterexample would be belgium , where elections are split between flemish voters voting for flemish parties and walloon voters voting for walloon parties , resulting in two separate political elites , which greatly frustrates cooperation ) . 
  besides , mmp is just too devilishly complicated -- voting systems should be straightforward , like simple pr . 
  * i just like the idea of the elite/civil service having an excellent `` broad '' education * ( bildung ) * , i guess . 
  those who rule over us should not be complete nitwits when they get out of their specialistic fields ; they should have a decent idea of history , literature , nature , etc. 
  * yes . 
  if we do n't actively protect our interests worldwide , china , russia and the us will call the tune everywhere beyond our own borders , which will definitely hurt us at home in the long run . 
  yeah the specific provincial borders were more an interesting thought exercise than a practical proposal . 
  a better solution , if you really wanted roughly equal-sized provinces , would be just carving up some of the larger countries ( and * maybe * merging some of the smaller , e.g. 
  the three baltic states ) . 
  there actually was a [ system ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4e2a4q/prefectures_of_imperial_europe_2050/d1wd4jf ) behind it , to some degree . 
  yeah that was a tough one . 
  there were n't any more relevant cities i could use in that area :p, 
  this is probably the most relevant the song [ `` servant in heaven , king in hell '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_brvfuiz2c ) is ever going to be ... 
  this article is garbage . 
  it goes for cheap `` yeah !, 
  you tell 'em !, 
  boo muslims ! '', 
  points without saying anything interesting or relevant . 
   because of a lack of higher education and the lack of non-skilled jobs , immigrants absorb a higher part of unemployment and social security payments than the average citizen . 
  as a group , they receive more money than they pay in taxes . 
  no shit , sherlock . 
  what 's the point of repeating obvious information like this when you 're not going to use it in an argument , other than `` grumble muslims grumble '' ? 
   there is no question that unemployment is much higher among muslim immigrant communities than among the general public . 
  there are two possible explanations . 
  both of which are true to a degree , and amplify each other . 
  the `` either-or '' approach he takes is a ridiculous oversimplification . 
  yes , lots of muslims have primitive ideas about society , religion and the position of women , but that does n't mean hiring discrimination does n't exist . 
   what did `` we '' do to `` them '' ? 
  we opened up our cities , our houses , our wallets . 
  and in our secular temples of progress -- our metro stations and airports and theaters -- their sons are killing themselves , and taking our sons and daughters with them . 
  the scare quotes almost make me think he 's aware of his own ridiculously exaggerated black-and-white thinking . 
  he seems to think the terrorists somehow represent the collective will of all european muslims -- as if muslims in europe all hate our guts and want attacks like these to happen . 
  i 'm not claiming that all , or even most muslims are shining beacons of tolerance , but this is the opposite extreme . 
   there is nothing for which we need to apologize . 
  `` occidentophobia '' originated in the muslim community . 
  we need to demand they abandon it . 
  and how do you envision that ? 
  going up to muslims and telling them `` now see here , you stop hating the west this instant '' ? 
  * that * will be a rousing success !, 
  immigration , integration , and radicalisation are * complex * issues , not simple ones that can be easily solved as long as you 're `` tough '' enough . 
  this article has nothing remotely productive to add to the discussion . 
  i think this is the first time i see one of these etymology maps where german and english * and no one else * share a colour . 
  this comment would be a lot more interesting if you had flair . 
  * ` events , dear boy ... ' *, 
  what kind of flemish guy can hide his raging inferiority complex long enough to pass for `` self-respecting '' ? 
  glorious small flat egalitarian north sea union !, 
  or actually : germany , just absorb us already . 
  we 'll be a good * bundesland * , unlike those smelly bavarians -- kick them out . 
  ~ ~ secretly ~ ~ my end goal is a protestant superstate . 
  i think the belgians ca n't figure this out themselves either , and that 's why the roads are so terrible . 
  i 'll never forget the $ 4 all-you-can-eat deal in budapest ( and the food was really great too ) . 
  also : great rafting . 
  i expected to see stupid photoshops of nicholas cage 's face . 
  the internet has ruined me forever . 
  this is how world wars start . 
  well , given their history , that 's no surprise . 
  our local far-right party has also shown a weird obsession with animal rights . 
  especially when they had [ this clown ] ( http://www.refdag.nl/polopoly_fs/dion_graus_42_1_55851!image/2339298077.jpg ) in parliament . 
  i 'll just repeat an earlier comment of mine :  i read a history of hungary over the summer , and the parallels with my own country 's history are striking . 
  we were ruled over by spanish habsburgs , they by austrian habsburgs . 
  in both cases , habsburg rule meant :  * a government better at building lots of fancy palaces for itself than actually running the country * unwavering commitment to the merciless persecution of protestants of all stripes * spectacular bouts of rape-pillage - ` n-burn by spanish and italian mercenaries , barbaric even by the standards of those days  seriously , fuck the habsburgs . 
  or , as i put it in another comment ( no points for guessing which sub ) :  remove schnitzel remove schnitzel . 
  yuo are the \u00f6sterreich idiot yuo are the \u00f6sterreich smell .
