   i say ` right , i need a restaurant for a person who does n't drink . ', 
  he looks confused , but ** in ireland he 's gotten used to it . 
  ** seems like i need to update my view of ireland . 
  a stupid joke , but it 's immensely satisfying to watch a stuck-up * prinzipienreiter * like corbyn get laughed off the stage . 
  i 'm actually really worried about a possible brexit . 
  i ultimately want to live in a european superpower with a highly united government , and britain leaving would be a serious blow to any project in that direction . 
  other than that i 'm mostly annoyed that the whole thing ( at least according to our media 's summary of what their media are saying ) seems to be framed more as a dick-measuring contest between johnson and cameron than as a decision with far-reaching consequences for britain and the eu . 
  mostly a vanity thing , i think . 
  on facebook , you shout your witty observations at your facebook friends . 
  on twitter , you potentially shout them at * the world * . 
  it 's like the navigable waterways map . 
  the netherlands , a shining beacon of relevance !, 
   ` you tweet a lot , ' the policemen said according to jongeneel when they had sat down in his office . 
  ` we have received orders to ask you to watch your tone . 
  your tweets can come across as inflammatory . ', 
  it 's the mafia-style vagueness that bothers me the most . 
  ` watch it ... or else . ', 
  if people are breaking the law make it clear to them , and if they are n't , leave them alone . 
  ( also , this is probably the most literal example to date of the term `` tone police '' . ), 
  ah , the classic `` our reputation is more important than any kind of basic human decency whatsoever . '', 
  organisation screws up , word gets out to the press , organisation panics and tries to bully ( or bribe ) the whistleblower into silence . 
   `` fuck eastern poland '' poland b ca n't catch a break , can it ? 
  thank you for your constructive feedback , i 'll keep that in mind next time .

  oh look , it 's seehofer pretending he 's the president of an independent country again . 
  wel it is n't called * spani\u00eb * ... 
  * does n't sound quite as catchy . 
  actually a closer correspondence would be * - i\u00eb * -  * - ien * and * - ije * -  * - ei * ( * t\u00fcrkei * , * slowakei * ) . 
  i have no idea how to pronounce it either . 
  thanks !, 
  i used an advanced technology known as ms paint . 
  your username is highly appropriate here . 
  this is a ridiculously far-fetched connection , constructed from guilt by association and over-the-top alarmism . 
  the sad thing is that many british voters will probably think along these lines as well . 
  make one !, 
  :d it would be cool if this became one of those themed-map fads . 
  unwashed mountain peasants who follow the false church of rome and speak an unintelligible pidgin that bears only the vaguest resemblance to german . 
  enthusiastic followers of hitler , and even today creepily far-right at times ( heil haider ! ) . 
  to go further back , schwarzenberg was a huge dick . 
  the fact that his people still have a prominent square in vienna named after him is kind of disturbing . 
  to go even further back ... 
  i read a history of hungary over the summer , and the parallels with my own country 's history are striking . 
  we were ruled over by spanish habsburgs , they by austrian habsburgs . 
  in both cases , habsburg rule meant : * a government better at building lots of fancy palaces for itself than actually running the country * unwavering commitment to the merciless persecution of protestants of all stripes * spectacular bouts of rape-pillage - ` n-burn by spanish and italian mercenaries , barbaric even by the standards of those days seriously , fuck the habsburgs . 
  so ... yeah . 
  i do n't really have a lot of positive associations with austria . 
  eh , it 's russia . 
  it 's not like they 're doing this in a developed country with competent and non-corrupt law enforcement . 
  * ** - land ** is pretty self-explanatory . 
  * ** - rijk ** means `` realm '' ( so * frankrijk * = `` realm of the franks '' , * oostenrijk * = `` realm of the east '' ) . 
  * ** - i\u00eb ** and ** - ije ** are both corruptions of the latin ending * - ia * . 
  * ** - en ** is a middle dutch third-case ( dative ) ending that somehow took over as the main name at some point . 
  * ** - o ** is only found in country names which we directly cribbed from other languages without adding a dutch twist of our own . 
  * like most germanic languages , we simply call belarus `` white russia '' . 
  * slovaks and slovenes , rejoice : unlike in english , your country names sound quite different in dutch . 
  * the uk is a bit of a dubious case , as * verenigd koninkrijk * ( `` united kingdom '' ) refers to the structure of its government rather than any geographical name . 
  the name * groot-brittanni\u00eb * ( `` great britain '' ) is also often used , similarly to how english speakers will usually refer to their country as `` britain '' rather than `` the united kingdom '' . 
  in informal spoken dutch , though , all you 'll ever hear is * engeland * . 
  * edit : oh shit , i forgot malta !, 
  thanks / u/zsmg for reminding me . 
  for the record , we just call it * malta * . 
  reading this made my day . 
  denmark big, 
  i wish the police and other authorities would n't rush ahead with such panicked `` but it 's got nothing to do with the refugees '' comments . 
  it 's not even clear yet whether this is true ; either way , it will not convince anyone -- rather , it will confirm the impression that the authorities are trying to deny or downplay the problems around the refugee crisis .

  hey , the nazis wanted to unify europe , not separate it .

  `` here is fran\u00e7ois hollande , surrounded by all his friends . '', 
  `` dumb belgian '' jokes are getting more realistic and less funny with every article i read these days . 
  and here i was thinking it would be molenbeek . 
  thank you for your contribution , mme. 
  le pen . 
  if i may hazard a guess myself , i think the mindset i described above might have something to do with the `` i wan na be the very best '' mentality that 's a cornerstone of american culture . 
  there 's a lot of pressure on people to excel , and if you fail to excel it 's usually seen as your own fault . 
  hence , if there 's anything that 's less than perfect about yourself ( including psychological issues ) you 're supposed to take action to fix it .
