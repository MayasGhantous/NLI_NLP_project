  it seems to me that europeans tend to have less of this `` quest for perfection '' mentality and be more accepting of certain flaws -- which has its own problems when taken to extremes , but it 's a lot less stressful . 
   we 're not some strange , alien people . 
  that 's what you * want * us to think . 
  we 've had a professional military since the early '90s and i do n't think it 's a bigger `` part of our society '' than in germany . 
  quite the contrary , i always felt like conscription made the military a * more * prominent part of society in germany because so many people had direct experience with it . 
  as for america , they spend about four times as much on defence ( as a percentage of gdp ) as most european countries , and have a significantly higher number of active personnel ( as a percentage of population ) as well , so that probably explains a lot . 
  oh , and therapy . 
  in america it seems to be normal to see a therapist for relatively minor hangups , and to tell internet strangers they should `` seek professional help '' for everything and anything . 
  here , as far as i can tell , you only go into therapy if you have * really * serious depression/ptss/alcoholism / etc. . 
   the nazis ' mass deportations of jews from greece in 1943 and 1944 largely ended the life of a thriving community . 
  who 'd have thought it ? 
   powys tax rebellion / r/paradoxplaza is leaking . 
  but yeah , this is a great initiative . 
  would be cool if it actually led to change but i 'm not getting my hopes up . 
   if the whole eu pulled together on these issues well there 's your problem . 
   simple solutions yeah , that 's never going to catch on in belgium . 
  and much more importantly , in / r/ik _ ihe . 
   fort of the foreigners ooh , that 's a touchy subject . 
  fitting that it 's in the north . 
   the syrian crisis is a very contentious topic with many different groups , and although i understand ypg are fighting against isis the situation is far too complex to understand in black and white ** as expected by the student . 
  ** so , basically , his reasoning boils down to `` our members are idiots '' ? 
  as we say in the netherlands : * t\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9ring . 
  that looks delicious . 
  [ better version ] ( http://www.bakker-hillegom.nl/is-bin/intershop.static/wfs/org-01nl-site/org/nl_nl/xl/80434.jpg ), 
  i went `` wait !, 
  you drew poland upside down , you idiot ! '', 
  then realised which subreddit i was in . 
  fair enough . 
  i tend to focus much more on differences within europe than on differences between europe and `` the colonies '' , so from my perspective the netherlands and britain are pretty far apart . 
  ( the scandinavian countries , especially denmark , are a lot more similar to us . ), 
  oooooh , that 's actually pretty clever . 
  fair enough . 
  we 're famously egalitarian and undeferential , you have the most intricate class system in europe . 
  we roll our eyes at people who try to stand out from the crowd , you cherish individual eccentricity . 
  we 're allergic to pomp and formal ceremonial , you cling to all kinds of traditions full of fancy dress and antique titles . 
  we 're notoriously blunt and direct , you speak in understatements and implications . 
  so yeah , i do n't think we 're so similar at all . 
  `` did a lot of bad stuff in the past and now has a successful populist party that 's anti-eu and anti-immigration '' applies to half of europe . 
  fat chance . 
  by the end of the 17th century we were falling behind for several reasons , not all of them related to military defeats . 
  also bear in mind that we do n't have the large coal and iron deposits that enabled you guys to kick off the industrial revolution . 
  it 's inversely proportional to the number of days till next reich, 
  why does n't slovenia also build a fence already ... schengen will fall to pieces if people can just walk in like this . 
  also , `` wet , freezing weather '' ? 
  something does n't add up here . 
  well , what can i say , we 've always been a bit stingy . 
  [ mfw greece still has n't figured out our secret ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v9kcsxs.jpg ), 
  this is why we need to close the damn outer borders already and process people 's applications at the gates . 
  once people are here , physically , it 's very hard to get rid of them . 
  well serbia does n't even know how big their country is . 
  keeping track of this kind of thing is probably beyond them . 
   it 's so much easier ( and cheaper ) to ignore the problem as long as there is no public outcry . 
   quite on the contrary , at least in germany , * deporting * illegals is what will often cause a public outrage and demonstrations , * not * leaving them be . 
  have n't attitudes shifted a bit due to the massive influx we 're now seeing ? 
  new rule : if you `` lose '' your passport and refuse to provide any information as to your home country , you will be sent to south sudan . 
  tl ; dr : * what will you say , in 20 years , when your children ask you `` why did n't you invest in eastern poland ? 
  fun fact : trains are fed with alternating current , therefore they have to switch direction 50 times per second . 
  we only feel the illusion of forward motion because the radiation from the overhead power lines temporarily lowers our brain capacity . 
   they 're not italian though , despite the title . 
  they 're built by siemens , which you may know from ... belgian ... trains . 
  does n't really make it better . 
  there is still some debate as to whether the refugees will be issued parachutes . 
  [ oh all right then , have it your ( med ) way ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raid_on_the_medway ) ( also worth noting how [ your ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_anglo-dutch_war#1673 ) [ attempts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walcheren_campaign ) in the other direction have gone ), 
  i still call humblebrag . 
  that 's a pleasingly rectangular column of people . 
  dear mr. corbett , how do you feel about jeremy corbyn -- particularly his stance towards russia ? 
  if there were three things you could change about the political system of the european union ( ep , commission , council , etc. 
  ) , what would they be ? 
  thank you . 
  ugh , one of those `` dae not have a clue about sports ?! '', 
  comics -- with the undertones of `` sports are a silly thing to care about , and fortunately you and i are enlightened people who realise that '' never far away . 
  following sports is like playing board games , or drinking alcohol . 
  you do n't * have * to do it , but it 's a lot less * gezellig * if you do n't , and if you 're going to be a smug little bitch about not doing it then get out . 
  ( i normally love xkcd , by the way , this one just hits a nerve . ), 
  try speed skating . 
  simplest sport , best sport . 
  also the number of olympic gold medals correlates strongly with the average iq , charisma , and sexual prowess of a country 's citizens .

  well given that suriname has like 9-10 different languages it would be kind of confusing if they used the surinamese flag to represent any single language . 
  i 'm waiting for the day some website uses the flag of suriname to represent dutch as a language . 
  i agree , it 's an outrage !, 
  they used the flag of luxembourg to represent us !, 
  searching in dutch , most european countries turn up `` is [ country ] expensive '' as the top suggestion or at least one of the top five , reflecting the chief concern of all dutch people past , present and future . 
  variations on `` england/great britain/the united kingdom '' mostly turn up existential questions ( `` is england a country ? 
  is britain the same as the united kingdom ? 
  what * is * the united kingdom ? '' ), 
  france gives `` is france safe '' as the top suggestion -- apparently the charlie hebdo attacks have n't been forgotten . 
  lots of school kids seem to have been assigned the same question about belgium : `` is belgium a country where church and state are strictly separated ? '', 
  for the rest it 's mostly questions about eu membership . 
  how can finland be real if lakes are n't real, 
  as our tax collection service [ knows all too well ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7afd3bd6-bcac-11e2-b344-00144feab7de.html#axzz3ne20f163 ) by now :(, 
   welcome to the bulgarian youtube territory !, 
  this is the greatest channel name i 've seen in a long time , possibly ever . 
  so the most human-influenced place in europe is ... belgium . 
  just goes to show that `` human influence '' is n't necessarily constructive , coordinated , or sane . 
  ** country : ** the netherlands ** favourite neighbour : ** germany ** least favourite neighbour : ** belgium, 
  i think that makes you the only one of serbia 's neighbours who likes serbia . 
   favorite : netherlands aww shucks \\ ^_^  least favorite : bavaria [ amen to that .
