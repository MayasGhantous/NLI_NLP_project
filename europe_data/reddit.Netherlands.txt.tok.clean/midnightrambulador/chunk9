  what do you guys think ? 
  i 'm cautiously optimistic myself . 
  a serious proposal along these lines -- stop illegal immigration , create a more or less manageable legal route -- really feels like a `` fuckin ' * finally * '' moment to me . 
  the fact that there has already been behind-the-screens coordination and other countries are seemingly willing to play along gives me hope that it can be a success . 
  * this is a blog post i made in september last year . 
  i tried to submit it to / r/europe then , but it got auto-rejected because of the wordpress domain . 
  now , however , i feel that an optimistic post about europe would be a nice change of pace from all the `` refugee apocalypse , brexit , europe falling apart ! '', 
  news we read every day , so i decided to submit the whole essay as a text post . 
  the original blog post can be found [ here ] ( https://bismarx.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/europe-visions-of-empire/ ) . 
  * some time ago i read * imperium der zukunft : warum europa weltmacht werden muss * ( `` empire of the future : why europe must become a world power '' ) by alan posener . 
  i did n't particularly like it -- although there are some sharp observations in there , it 's unclear to me what posener actually proposes , and he takes way too many cheap shots at his supposed opponents . 
  the book did , however , get me thinking about what an empire of europe could look like . 
  and the answer i came up with was `` uh , something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0pw99gb.png ) ? '', 
  ** i ** you 'll notice that my fantasy empire is a lot bigger than the current union , stretching all the way to the russian border and covering all of the balkans as well as notorious separatist holdouts like switzerland and norway . 
  kaliningrad , or rather k\u00f6nigsberg , is firmly in european hands as well . 
  german readers will recognise the little star in the middle as frankfurt am main . 
  why should frankfurt be the imperial capital ? 
  well , for starters , it 's more or less centrally located . 
  it 's already a major transport hub and powerful financial centre ( housing , among other things , the ecb 's headquarters ) . 
  it 's not an existing national capital , avoiding implications that the imperial project is actually one european country annexing the others . 
  and last but not least , [ it has precedent for this sort of thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankfurt_parliament ) . 
  the empire is divided into provinces called `` prefectures '' ( more on that name later ) . 
  to form these , i looked up eurostat 's population figures by nuts-2 region , and started grouping regions into blocks of approximately 10 million people . 
  ( see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4e2a4q/prefectures_of_imperial_europe_2050/d1wd4jf ) for more details on how i formed the prefectures . ), 
  such a size would make each prefecture big enough to efficiently organise most functions of government , but too small to be even a middling regional power in its own right . 
  more importantly , making the prefectures all roughly the same size would remove the whole dynamic of `` small countries '' versus `` big countries '' that causes so much rivalry and tension in the existing european union . 
  ( on the map , prefectures are grouped into seven `` circles '' , but these are merely for orientation and statistical purposes ; there are no institutions of government at the circle level . 
  however , large businesses , sports leagues , and ngos often use the circles as convenient dividing lines in their organisational structure . ), 
  in many places , i deliberately cut across existing national borders , to emphasise that the empire is a new state running on its own logic -- not just a tighter form of cooperation between existing countries . 
  ** ii ** so how is this new state governed ? 
  obviously it 's too big for an entirely centralised system , so responsibilities are divided between the imperial government and the prefectures . 
  examples of policy areas left to the prefectures include education , police , healthcare and transportation , whereas frankfurt concerns itself with things like social security , foreign affairs , energy , and defence . 
  ( social security in particular will be a daunting task to harmonise across all of europe , but it 's essential for a coherent economic policy . ), 
  thorny questions about fundamental rights , in areas such as medical ethics and family law , are also decided on an imperial level . 
  the alpha and omega of imperial politics is the senate , a 500-member legislative assembly . 
  the senate is elected every four years by proportional representation , with the same lists of candidates on every ballot throughout europe . 
  to prevent fragmentation , there is a voting threshold of 7.5 % -- we do n't really need more than four or five parties . 
  to keep out parties with a strong regional focus , each new party needs to gather a large number of signatures * in each prefecture * in order to register for elections ( say , 0.05 % of the prefecture 's total population ) . 
  otherwise , the senate could turn into a mere addition sum of bickering regional interests , which is one of the biggest problems with the current eu . 
  the executive branch of government is headed by the imperial chancellor , who together with his ministers forms the imperial cabinet . 
  ( there 's also a president of the empire , elected by the senate , but he 's more of a figurehead , similar to the current presidents of germany and italy ) . 
  needless to say , both the appointment of cabinet members and the policy decisions they make need to be approved by the senate . 
  there are nine ministers on the cabinet , each leading a department of the imperial civil service ( ics ) : energy , natural resources , and the environment ; interior ( home office ) ; foreign affairs ; defence ; labour and economic affairs ; finance ; immigration and integration ; science and culture ; justice and civil rights . 
  a new senate means a new cabinet , but the reverse is n't true : if a cabinet collapses prematurely , because of internal strife or a vote of no confidence from the senate , a new cabinet is formed and has to seek the approval of the existing senate . 
  besides the senate , there 's also the constitutional council . 
  this is a 50-member assembly elected by the prefectural legislatures . 
  its members have no party allegiance and serve six-year terms . 
  to create some distance from the day-to-day political process , and prevent mid-term surprises that can hamstring a cabinet , council elections are held in piecemeal fashion , with two council members being elected every three months . 
  to keep council members from becoming `` delegates '' who represent a single prefecture 's interests -- remember , we do n't want regional interests dictating imperial policy !, 
  -- the votes from * all * prefectural legislatures are thrown onto the same pile . 
  the council concerns itself with the technical details of bills and their compliance with the imperial constitution , combining aspects of an upper house of parliament and a constitutional court . 
  the council 's approval is necessary for a bill to become law ; it can also strike down existing legislation as unconstitutional , but this requires an 80 % majority . 
  ** iii ** on the prefectural level , things work largely the same , with a legislature called a diet , and a cabinet headed by a governor . 
  ( there is no prefectural equivalent of the constitutional council . ), 
  each prefecture is divided further into departments , again with their own legislative and executive institutions ; the exact structure and terminology of these lower tiers of government varies slightly by prefecture , though , and major cities are often given a special status . 
  speaking of terminology , should n't something called a `` prefecture '' have a prefect ? 
  it should , and it does . 
  the prefect is a sort of ambassador of the imperial government : the eyes , ears and voice of frankfurt within his prefecture . 
  as the prefect is a civil servant who does not answer directly to any elected body , he has no decision-making powers of his own . 
  the prefect and his staff , responsible for maintaining good relations with the prefectural institutions and making sure they properly carry out the laws of empire , are on the payroll of the home office -- one of the aforementioned departments of the imperial civil service . 
  given the empire 's size , the ics obviously forms only a small portion of the entire civil service ; the total number of civil servants employed at the prefectural level and below is much greater . 
  but what the ics lacks in quantity , it makes up for in quality : these are the elite troops of empire , drilled in a prussian ethos of duty and discipline . 
  they enjoy high salaries and generous benefits , but there 's a zero-tolerance policy for fraud , embezzlement , favoritism and other such abuses -- and the ics only takes the best . 
  `` the best '' are the graduates of academies of the empire ( aote ) . 
  these schools , established specifically to educate ics personnel , are the only form of education run from the imperial rather than the prefectural level ; there is at least one aote in each prefecture . 
  in many ways , the aote are to the empire what the * grandes \u00e9coles * are to modern-day france . 
  academies of the empire do n't only provide excellent university-level programmes in various fields relevant to ics work ( such as tax law , econometrics or environmental biology ) ; all students are also taught extensively about european history , and the wide range of cultural sensibilities they 'll encounter at their postings from iceland to cyprus . 
  last but not least , the aote programme includes absolute fluency in the three languages of empire : german , french and english . 
  aote charge no tuition , but the admission exam is very difficult , and students who ca n't keep up with the demanding curriculum are swiftly shown the door . 
  aote graduates are guaranteed a job in the ics -- in fact , they are required to work there for at least five years ( the empire has invested heavily in their education , after all ) . 
  many opt for a longer career in the ics , but aote graduates are also highly sought after in the private sector . 
  ** iv ** i mentioned german , french and english as the `` three languages of empire '' ; fluency in these three is required not only for ics personnel , but also for anyone with political ambitions at the imperial level ( all three languages are allowed in senate debates ) . 
  in general , whenever imperial citizens of different native languages need to communicate , they tend to use one of these three . 
  of course , many more languages are spoken throughout europe , and these can attain a status called imperial accreditation if they meet certain requirements : a minimum number of native speakers within the empire ( say , 200,000 ) ; a standardised grammar and spelling ; and a language academy , located within imperial territory , which regulates those standards -- think e.g. 
  of the * acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise * . 
  ( you hear that , english ? 
  no academy , no recognition . 
  get your act together already . ), 
  only imperially accredited languages are allowed to be used in official contexts ( e.g. 
  schools , courts of law , and government communication ) -- including at the prefectural , departmental , and local level . 
  the empire supports accredited academies in preserving and promoting their respective languages . 
  imperial legislation must be translated into all accredited languages ; prefectural legislation into all accredited languages spoken in that prefecture ( usually two or three ) . 
  ** v ** last but not least , the empire maintains a huge military to protect both europe itself and european interests throughout the world . 
  with almost two million active personnel , a dozen aircraft carriers , and a nuclear arsenal inherited from britain and france , the imperial european armed forces are not to be taken lightly . 
  ( of course , worldwide nuclear disarmament is a big priority in the empire 's diplomacy , but the empire will not disarm unilaterally -- that would leave it at a serious strategic disadvantage against less scrupulous powers . ), 
  the american troops once stationed in europe have long gone home . 
  ** vi ** all right , back to reality . 
  even if everyone in europe focused all their energy on making this happen , we 'd reach the situation outlined above in 2050 at the earliest -- and , well , somehow i do n't think everyone in europe is going to do that . 
  in the current climate at least , an empire of europe crosses too many interests and offends too many sensibilities to be remotely politically feasible -- and that 's not even going into the practical problems . 
  getting belgrade , donetsk and palermo to march in lockstep with frankfurt on a bunch of really important issues ? 
  convincing norway and switzerland to join the european project ? 
  prying k\u00f6nigsberg and crimea from russia 's hands without accidentally triggering world war iii ? 
  * entirely abolishing all european nation-states and replacing them with provinces cutting crisscross through existing borders ? 
  * those are n't exactly easy tasks , no matter how many top-educated prussian bureaucrats you throw at them . 
  in general , far-off utopian blueprints are rarely a good basis for practical policymaking , and these `` visions of empire '' are no exception . 
  why did i bother writing them down , then ? 
  because sometimes , it can help to articulate what you * really * want , in order to provoke thought and inspire debate . 
  and , well , imperial europe is the kind of europe i 'd * really * want to live in . 
  a europe with a streamlined and democratic central government , rather than the gordian political knot that is `` brussels '' today . 
  a europe that strides confidently across the world stage as a superpower in its own right , dealing with the us and china on an equal footing and with russia from a position of superiority .
