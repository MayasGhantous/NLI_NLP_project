where did i justify genocide ? 
  why are you putting words into my mouth ? 
  all i gave you is just to clear your picture a little bit , because you seem to see ukrainian-polish relationship over the centuries in a very black & white manner ( with obvious bias ) . 
  claiming that it was all evil nazi ukrainians causing the genocide is historically wrong . 
  look , i 'm disgusted by bandera and shuhevych being praised by ultra-right in ukraine , but saying bereza kartuska was used only for mass murderers is just plain wrong . 
  most of the prisoners there were held without a trial simply for criticizing polish government and supporting ukrainian independence . 
  all in all you ca n't possibly discuss volhynia massacre without understanding the situation as it evolved from 1919 . 
  you ca n't simplify things and call oun upa `` nazis '' while expecting nobody to counter your points . 
  it 's a hard topic to discuss and trying to simplify it by attaching labels is not going to make it easier for anyone . 
  so are you going to claim that upa did that out of the blue ? 
  or maybe it has something to do with republic of poland doing some [ utterly stupid shit to ukrainians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacification_of_ukrainians_in_eastern_galicia_%281930%29 ) ? 
  and polish state did n't have any [ a concentration camp for political prisoners ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bereza_kartuska_prison ) , where people could be held indefinitely ? 
  so if it 's quoting a lie and propaganda it becomes ok and `` a serious journalism '' . 
  ok , then i 'll quote some random guy i just met in my office and you should not , i repeat , ** you should not ** take it personally since it 's a quote : `` rinnve is a nazi and in my opinion is literally worth than hitler '' . 
  there you go , journalism rt style . 
  i think i should apply , they 're increasing spending anyway . 
  can you even google http://lmgtfy.com/?q=kiev+junta+site%3art.com, 
   ukrainian car industry do n't think it exists . 
  ukraine 's `` car '' industry is laz ( bus manufacturer , with manual assembly lines ) and bogdan ( smaller city buses , 3000 a year ) . 
  everyone other factory is simply assembling opel/chevrolet , huyndai , lada , etc. 
   right sector and other militant fascist organizations did the bulk of the fighting and ultimately lead the overthrow of the yanukovych regime . 
  how come there was only one right sector member killed during the protests if they `` did the bulk of the fighting '' . 
   ultimately lead the overthrow of the yanukovych regime . 
  and i thought it was yatsenuk , klitchko and tyagnybok , since they were the ones that led political groups in rada that [ had impeached yanukovych ] ( http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_2?id=&amp;pf3516=4204&amp;skl=8 ) . 
   a tonne of rs prisoners were let free . 
  five prisoners . 
  it 's still five more than i 'd like to see , but it 's definitely not `` a tonne '' . 
   they 're not some fringe element they are a fringe element , look at results of recent presidential elections . 
  the only nationalistic party in future parliamentary elections has a popular support of [ no more than 5 % ] ( http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9f%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%82%d1%81%d1%8c%d0%ba%d1%96_%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b8_%d0%b2_%d0%a3%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%97%d0%bd%d1%96_2014#.d0.a1.d0.be.d1.86.d1.96.d0.be.d0.bb.d0.be.d0.b3.d1.96.d1.87.d0.bd.d1.96_.d0.be.d0.bf.d0.b8.d1.82.d1.83.d0.b2.d0.b0.d0.bd.d0.bd.d1.8f ) . 
  it 's hardly newsworthy -- there 're people with all kind of background in volunteer battalions . 
  of course , in this exact case it 's azov , the battalion which was created with nationalistic slogans behind it . 
  but there were no reports of war crimes committed by `` ultra-nazi-fascist '' azov . 
  meanwhile , the most grave war crimes were committed by [ aidar battalion ] ( http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/eur50/040/2014/en ) , which mostly consists of afghan war veterans . 
  but hey , showing some stupid insignia is much more of news nowadays . 
  i thought it only fragments after impact ? 
  buk missile explodes on proximity , just like any other ground-to-air missile . 
   so basically the report gives us almost no information at all ... so far ? 
  this report confirms that the plane was downed by a missile . 
  this report is not about who did this and it ca n't be about it . 
   copy the information from the black box ( done via usb ) black boxes do n't have usb interface . 
   it still however does not explain why nato will not issue satellite pictures of the impact because they do n't have a constant video stream of every single point on earth , that 's not how satellites work . 
   kiev refuses to release the voice coms from the plane . . 
  this investigation release voice communication . 
  it 's not ukraine 's responsibility anyway . 
  i personally know of problems with only one producer : stirolbiopharm ( http://stirolbiopharm.com.ua/ ) in horlivka has stopped its production because city was seized by rebels . 
  it 's an important producer , which produces some of vital components of medicaments badly needed in ato , but it 's a problem that is currently being solved by importing those components from poland and belarus . 
  i have a few friends working in pharmaceutical industry and they have not raised any concerns so far ( except for aforementioned the stirolbiopharm situation ) . 
  summary : you sound like you 're talking out of your ass or just plain trolling . 
   10 russian soldiers strayed across the border into ukraine and were captured . 
  yep , got lost and wandered for 20 kilometers away from ukrainian border . 
  with guns . 
  without insignia . 
  within war zone . 
  sounds as credible as the rest of your bullshit response . 
  i 've stopped reading the letter after this  you need to know , for example , that accusations of a major russian `` invasion '' of ukraine appear not to be supported by reliable intelligence . 
  so , captured army personnel , captured/destroyed arms and machinery with russian insignia , dozens of russian soldiers dying is not evidence ? 
  go fuck yourself , buddy . 
  it 's as if you 've actually been to kyiv and have seen them . 
  since i 've been to kyiv recently i can tell you : there are no `` shirtless , tattooed , tire-burning nazi-wannabees running around kyiv '' . 
  on one hand , it was one of people 's demands : early elections . 
  on the other hand , it 's definitely an attempt to consolidate power at the peak of his popularity . 
  given that crimea is occupied and donetsk and lugank oblasts are ( maybe i 'm too pessimistic ) still going to be war zone , that 's a very big chunk of votes that traditionally go to ~ ~ donetsk or dnipropetrovsk oligarchy ~ ~ pro-russia politicians simply vanishing from electoral base . 
  basically , next elections will lead to absolutely pro-west coalition , which is something that poroshenko actively seeks . 
  we 'll see if it brings any real change , though . 
  verkhovna rada is not a good place in term of law making but a great place to make money by trading votes . 
  public is eagerly awaiting for the first real non-corrupt parliament since like forever . 
  please cite numbers instead of guessing next time . 
   the ukrainian government promptly released all right sector prisoners hahaha , but no , they did n't . 
  yarosh also rescinded his letter the next day after public and media outcry . 
  i have a russian colleague who is 100 % pro-putin . 
  `` russia needs a strong ruler '' is his defense of any criticism of putin . 
  makes me wonder why the hell he has n't moved back to russia if it 's so great there , with the strong leader and everything . 
  yeah , i would not treat this as a statement of intention , rather as an attempt to get more votes at next parliamentary elections from pro-western electorate . 
  ok , then please explain how a city as big as donetsk only attracted 5-10 thousand people for a [ meeting ] ( http://odnarodyna.com.ua/content/v-donecke-5-aprelya-proshel-ocherednoy-narodnyy-miting-foto-video ) organized by self-proclaimed `` governor '' of donetsk oblast on 5th of april ? 
  how come his [ meeting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcwx7khnjiy ) has gathered only 10k people on 7th of july ? 
  support for `` people 's republic '' is marginal in donetsk . 
  i ca n't deny that it 's higher in smaller cities , but it 's nowhere near overwhelming majority . 
   it 's a civil war , not an invasion . 
  which starts with `` green people '' with strong russian accent , using words only used by people from saint-petersburg invading slaviansk and horlivka on 12th of april . 
  first `` military action '' ( if you can call it that , since no shots were fired ) taken by ukraine happened in retaliation to these actions on 14th of ~ ~ may ~ ~ april . 
   do n't deny 16 million people agency . 
  which 16 million people are we talking about ? 
  because i 'm pretty sure that donetsk and lugansk oblasts are only 7 million people total and by accounts of my numerours friends and acquaintances from that region the new `` republics '' are not supported by majority . 
  edit : done goofed on dates . 
  two seas even : azov and black . 
  ukrainian army has presented a lot of evidence of russia supporting terrorists in donbass . 
  as for the gladfly system used for shooting down the plane , ukraine is claiming it has all its sam systems accounted for , which means that either terrorists have built gladfly on their own out of spare parts at the nearest diy store or the system was provided by russia ( since there are no other bordering countries in that region of ukraine ) . 
  i 'm all for giving a benefit of a doubt and following the `` not guilty until proven otherwise '' line of thinking , however here are the facts that we currently have : * in the early morning terrorists ( i will refuse to call them separatists from now on ) have bragged about acquiring `` gladfly '' mobile surface-to-air missile system . 
  the system was seen by ap journalists and multiple civilians . 
  * at around 3pm cet there are mutltiple videos uploaded to youtube , claiming to show an-26 downing . 
  dnr official twitter reports shooting down ukrainian military passenger plane . 
  multiple social media accounts , including one of igor strelkov confirm these news . 
  * at around 5pm cet news on mh17 are broken out . 
  videos of an-26 start to disappear . 
  ukrainian army is not prepared for air attacks . 
  terrorists do n't have airplanes . 
  there were no deployments of aa systems in ato zone reported by media . 
  there 's no reason for ukrainian army to shoot down a plane going from west to east . 
  so far terrorists shooting down the plane , russian terrorists shooting down the plane is the only plausible explanation . 
  probably ukrainian judo-nazi-benderivtsi power-hungry baby-eating genocide warmongers sponsored by eu and us .
