  or russians . 
  whatever is more plausible . 
   south ossetia itself is recognized by a few un countries , recognized by 4 out of 193 un members . 
  all of those are either russia or russia 's ally . 
  seems legit . 
   entire battalions of neo nazi 's to go kill russians in the east . 
  good statement , which you confirm by showing one video of ** two ** battalions . 
  out of almost hundred fighting . 
  also , why do you call them `` neo nazi '' ? 
  as for the russians in the east : i 'm sorry , but when there are armed russians in the east then i 'd say a properly organized sub-division of interior defence forces is in order . 
   i understand ukraine needs to fight the rebels . 
  . but when you send hardcore nazi 's the fact that some of these people come from far right political background does n't give you the right to make a sweeping generalization and call them `` hardcore nazi 's '' . 
   poroshenko is proud of these men as you can see here he 's proud of everyone defending ukrainian sole from insurgents , regardless of ethnicity or political views . 
  you try to make it sound as if poroshenko only supports ethnically ukrainian right-wing baby killers . 
   for which he replies `` no one criticizes our army ! '', 
  you dirty-dirty boy , it 's a straight out lie . 
  he said '' \u0433\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u0456 \u043f\u0430\u043f\u043b\u044e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0456\u044e '' which is translated into `` to shame and to shame our army '' ( yeah , we have 2 different words for shaming ) . 
  you deserve every one of those downvotes . 
   in ukraine we have a country that ... with a lot better equipment then what the syrians have not really , ukraine is one of the poorest european countries , with gdp per capita barely higher than that of syria . 
  defense spending has been minimal for 23 years of independence and due to the same period of peace not a lot of experienced troops exist . 
   they 've been shelling the city constantly without even trying to make a proper attempt to storm it . 
  that 's a false statement -- there were multiple ( [ june 3rd ] ( http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/3372900-shturm-slavianska-onlain ) , [ may 12th ] ( http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/3361981-v-slavianske-nachalsia-shturm-samooborona-donbassa ) , [ april 24th ] ( http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/3353823-shturm-slavianska-onlain-khronyka-sobytyi ) , etc ) attack attempts which resulted in losses of people and equipment . 
   the majority of civilians have fled into russia . 
  take a look at the map and tell me if it 's easier to flee to kharkov or rostov . 
  and then provide me with a source for your claim . 
   the militants were outnumbered , outgunned and unorganised . 
  this is very different from reality . 
  insurgents are mostly well equipped , trained by former and current military professionals . 
   they were even using airpower . 
  they could have taken it . 
  how is airpower helpful in taking a densely populated city ? 
  unless we 're talking about leveling the city to the ground , airpower is rarely useful in urban environment . 
   even if ukraine wins all of the east back , the locals simply wo n't accept to go back to pre-2011 ukraine . 
  what 's a pre-2011 ukraine and why would anyone have to go back to it ? 
  and what gives you the power to speak for all locals ? 
   these people are n't fit to join the eu . 
  indeed . 
  this has nothing to do with the topic on hand though . 
  do n't forget that ukraine is [ not even a candidate for eu membership ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/countries/check-current-status/index_en.htm ) . 
   it 's really disgusting to see how all of western europe is going out of it 's way to ignore all the dark sides of ukraine and believe in a fantasy . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  which fantasy ? 
  who ignores what ? 
   all of this talk of `` slava ukraine '' should be enough of a wake up call . 
  please elaborate . 
  i 'd like to know why `` glory to ukraine '' should be enough of a wake up call . 
  it 's mostly due to and donating dutch geodata : http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/and_data, 
  here you go http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a1%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%bd_29%e2%80%9430_%d0%b8%d1%8e%d0%bd%d1%8f_1941, 
  choose correct answer in regards to odessa fire : 1 . 
  it was carefully planned and executed by ukrainian government officials 2 . 
  it was carefully planned and executed by russian government officials 3 . 
  it was chaotic and resulted due to massive clashes between different groups of pro-russian and pro-ukrainian supporters with losses of life on both sides . 
  188 points , 21st in `` top '' this week : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/275jzg/lugansk_after_an_air_strike_on_june_2nd_extremely/ i 'd say it 's about the same . 
  do you have a source on `` cluster bomb '' ? 
  and how do you know if most of the killed had nothing to do with the building ? 
  the killed 8 . 
  and injured another 11 . 
  at least one of the killed was head of so called ministry of health of so called lugansk people 's republic . 
  jfyi . 
   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwkfpgcaauw[1] this video is so full of propaganda statements thrown around , facts twisted , facts that do n't match the script simply ignored , labels attached ( yaceniuk called a `` puppet '' ??? ), 
  that i 'm just appalled . 
  the mention of muzychko alone is a huge sign that this is just another russian propaganda video -- muzychko had a criminal case opened against him ** immediately ** and killed in the shooting during his arrest . 
  what has syria to do with ukraine ? 
  crimea referendum was legal ? 
  military coup that deposed yanukovych ? 
  so much nonsense in one video , i would be ashamed to post links to that shit if i were you . 
  it 's actually videos like these is why you 're called a troll . 
   about fascists ( yet again ) : what about bandera ? 
  i know it 's a minority , but they 're there . 
  you 're bloody kidding me . 
  i gave you the link to their program . 
  go and fucking find a fucking sign that they are fascists . 
  i hate svoboda with all my guts , but do n't you fucking throw word fascist if you ca n't fucking back up your claim , you useless troll . 
   berkut for example . 
  you 're an idiot and a clueless person . 
  or a troll . 
  or both . 
  berkut is just one of police departments . 
  here , fucking educate yourself : http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%91%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%ba%d1%83%d1%82_%28%d1%81%d0%bf%d0%b5%d1%86%d0%bf%d1%96%d0%b4%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b7%d0%b4%d1%96%d0%bb%29  ngos like chesno are funded by usaid . 
  they 're also sponsored by banks , simple people , oligarchs ,  rude :( i 'm only nice to people that care to ground their statements on something else but one video from youtube . 
   they did n't need to lie like this . 
  it was not necessary . 
  why not ? 
  why does russian media has to lie so blatantly ? 
   russian media is worse , but european does not lack far behind in lies . 
  examples god damn it , give me fucking * examples * !, 
   surely . 
  but it 's never one sided in this world . 
  you 're simplifying the issue . 
  you 're misrepresenting the issue , you have no clue about the timeline of events and your factual knowledge is lacking . 
  you spew bullshit and expect people to blindly believe you . 
  that aint gon na happen , buddy . 
   whatever . 
  i hate internet debates , and i hate you for insulting me . 
  wtf were you thinking ? 
  you know what 's good about internet debates ? 
  you can always provide and in return request proofs of statements . 
  you claimed a lot of things but could n't provide proofs of any of your claims , so you can keep hating . 
  i will however make sure that your nonsense is exposed without caring about your feelings . 
  that 's lugansk oda ( `` province administration '' ? ),
