  which was seized by separatists more than a month ago . 
  this was probably a secondary target after lugansk sbu where the majority of separatists are located . 
  even though oda and a lot of other governmental buildings in lugansk are seized by separatists , there was no major scale fighting in the city and this attack is hardly justified . 
  my friends from lugansk say that there were no air attack sirens before the incident . 
  overall i 'm disgusted by this attack , it was unjustified and civilians died for no reason at all . 
  the only `` target '' that was hit was a `` minister of culture '' of `` lnr '' , absolutely useless from ato perspective . 
  moreover , this puts a wildcard in the hands of separatists ' and russian propaganda . 
  your `` facts timeline '' and most `` facts '' are bit screwed up . 
  i 'll try to fix them without trying to offend you , but in all honesty i just think you 're a troll . 
   the foreign forces i speak of is the international support of maidan movement which was not democratically legitimized and kicked out an elected government . 
  maidan `` movement '' is in fact a protest . 
  a protest does n't have to be `` democratically legitimized '' . 
  in fact , the right to protest is protected by ukrainian consitution . 
  government is not elected by people , but rather chosen by parliament . 
  a previous government of azarov has self-dissolved on 28th of january . 
   the snipers in kiev were apparently not yanukovich police . 
  the investigation is still ongoing , however i have no idea what `` yanukovych police '' is . 
  care to enlighten me ? 
   i do n't know if that 's true , but why would he order his soldiers to kill protesters ? 
  that 's political suicide . 
  his level of support before maidan was barely above 5 % . 
  he was a political fiasco by the time of his fleeing . 
  he was however a greedy man , which can be seen through numerous anti-corruption journalistic investigations done by tetiana chornovol , mustafa nayem , sergii leschenko , etc. 
  there are various estimates of his corrupt actions , but mezhigorie alone could have cost more than 200 million usd . 
  do n't forget that it was privatized by yanukovich and made into his own palace . 
  and that 's just the tip of the iceberg . 
   john mccain went to ukraine and shook hands with svoboda , as did steinmeier . 
  svoboda holds three minister places and another important office i forgot the name of . 
  john mccain does not represent executive branch of power in usa , he 's just one of congressmen for minority party ( currently ) . 
  his visit neither proves nor disproves your allegations of `` west-sponsored coup '' . 
  however , following a very nice practice of not assuming guilty until proven , i 'll say that maidan has not in fact been sponsored by western powers . 
  it may have been sponsored by ukrainians living outside of ukraine like me , ukrainians in ukraine like my classmates , relatives and friends , non-ukrainians like some of my polish acquaintances and martians , but in any case those were individual contributions . 
  svoboda has two ministers in the government : ministry of ecology and the ministry of agriculture . 
  if you 're going to argue that these are important ministries , you 're clearly delusional . 
  the really important position is general prosecutor , mahnitskyi . 
  he has been quietly shitty in his position , nothing like the way he should act according to russian propaganda . 
   on fascism : svoboda calls for the killing of jews and russians , and for a strong united ukraine with nuclear weapons . 
  is n't that fascist ? 
  i gave you the link to svoboda 's political program , if you can find a quote that supports your statement , i 'll eat a hat of your choosing . 
  otherwise , go fuck yourself buddy and do n't throw words you ca n't backup . 
   what most pisses me off is the western media lying as much as the russians , they just hide it avlittle better . 
  those kony style videos on youtube were produced by american marketing firms and ngos supported by usa i invite you to give me a list of reputable internation sources that have blatantly lied in the following way : * misrepresented events timeline * outright lied about the presence of pro-ukrainian non-government paramilitary troops in `` freedom fighters areas '' * used footage from other , older conflicts while claiming it to be from recent events * used journalists to help detect ukrainian military positions ( recent lifenews reporters incident )  fuck russia , too . 
  it 's a mess , and if it gets any messier i will personally kick out my congressman . 
  what does your congressman have to do with anything here ? 
   russians are people just like us , anyone who has ever traveled farther than to the next town knows this - lets just be brothers and finally create a better future for everyone ... russians are people like us , except that 86 % support authoritarian militaristic expansive corrupted leadership of mister fuck him in the face with a rake putin . 
  thus majority of russians are not in fact people like us , but are supporters of an occupation and war . 
  i 'm quite passionate about this . 
  i just feel that politicians are ruining lives here ... 
  there 's a very little list of politicians ruining the life of people in ukraine , and most of them if not all reside in russia nowadays . 
  i 'm not going to bother listing all of them , but if you check the list of people that have fallen under sanctions from eu and usa and add putin and medvedev you 're going to be able to compile the list yourself . 
  yanukovych fled the country and did n't commit to his presidential duties . 
  since the ** elected ** ** parliament ** of ukraine has elected acting president of ukraine . 
  which foreign forces led to yanukovych fleeing the country ? 
  can you name a few ? 
  3 . who are the fascists you 're talking about ? 
  pravyi sector 's [ political program ] ( http://pravyysektor.info/slider/programa_ps/ ) is too far away from fascism . 
  [ svoboda 's ] ( http://www.svoboda.org.ua/pro_partiyu/prohrama/ ) is definitely nationalistic , but not even close to full-out fascism . 
  both parties have very low support as can be seen in presidental elections results and had a minority representation on maidan . 
  do you have any documents backing up your claims ? 
  ok , let 's rephrase it : `` according to [ 86 % of russians ] ( http://wciom.ru/index.php?id=459&amp;uid=114824 ) '' . 
   i also heard the exact same mirrored thing from the ukrainian news you heard exactly what from news ? 
   both sides are shitting on each other well , one side has broken international guarantees and occupied part of the other side 's territory and is stirring up shit in the other side 's eastern region , so i 'd say reverse shitting is a bit justified . 
   one sides calls the other `` occupants '' while them yell `` fascist '' back . 
  maybe , * just maybe * because one of the sides is indeed occupant force ? 
  or are you so delusional as to believe in `` referendum '' in crimea ? 
  or maybe you believe that separatists in donbas are actually * not * sponsored by russia ? 
  maybe [ these guys ] ( http://dpsu.gov.ua/ua/about/news/news_4191.htm ) on ** russian-ukrainian border ** are also ukrainians trying to stop the `` fascist '' government ? 
  i would say that it 's mostly the fantastic work from russian propaganda machine -- a lot of these people genuinely believe that maidan was started by pravyi sector , that it had been violent and everything was paid for by eu/us . 
  the word still strongly bears a lot of associations with horrors of wwii but it 's getting to the point were just having ukrainian passport means that you 're fascist in the eyes of general russian public . 
  and yes , people believe that kiev is a horror place were people are getting killed/abused based on their nationality and eastern ukraine is just trying to get rid of those `` animals in charge of puppet government '' . 
  i 've even heard people saying that this is exactly like kosovo which almost makes me cry in despair . 
  they 're serious . 
  i 've already had a few russians claim that i 'm fascist for not supporting crimea 's occupation and separatists in eastern ukraine . 
  yeah , just like these ones : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raaqqbirxiy born and raised in ukraine . 
  probably most of them have last names serdiuk , petrenko , koval . 
   tell it to nato and usa , who responsable for ukraine crisis can you provide us with evidence of nato and usa causing the crisis ? 
  so far there 's a lot of evidence of direct russian involvement , not so much of european or american . 
   ** dethrone ** rightfull ukraine president you do realize that you ca n't `` dethrone '' a president , only a monarchy head , do n't you ? 
  in any case , the president was impeached after fleeing the country and failing to act as a president for a long while . 
   now you have over 100 killed in odessa 48 , 8 of them from pro-ukrainian side , all 8 of them died from gunfire . 
  not excusing the dickheads that circled the separatists and possibly caused a fire , but you ca n't throw numbers around without backing them up with important contextual information . 
   by genocide from right sector get your facts straight : * the odessa situation was caused by separatists that attacked a pro-ukrainian march of football fans from kharkiv and odessa * separatists used guns * militia was guarding separatists shooting at the fans * enraged fans together with euromaidan supporters have had numerical advantage thus when the first deaths were reported , the fans turned into counter attack what followed is a tragedy , but you ca n't blame pravyi sector that was n't even there ( maybe some of its members were there ) . 
   right sector ( nazi organisation ) this has been debunked multiple times . 
   and now you dare call out russia for defend her interest near her own borders when its about to be filled by nato bases ? 
  which nato bases are we talking about ? 
  bases in poland , romania and germany ? 
  how close are those to russian border ? 
   for defend russian speakers ? 
  i 'm a russian speaker and i did n't need defense in ukraine . 
  multiple sociological researches showed that not even a justifiable minority of russian speakers were ever endangered based on language in ukraine . 
  btw , do you know how many * ukrainian-language * schools were there in crimea before russian occupation ? 
  i 've already read about two ukrainian schools being turned into russian-speaking schools . 
  how many ukrainian schools are there in russia overall , oh you mighty defenders of all that 's right in the world ? 
  after all there are at least two million ukrainians in russia . 
  maybe it 's time ukraine invades russia to protect ukrainian-speaking people there ? 
   for be against nazi ? 
  which nazis ? 
  the ones you foster ? 
  http://zn.ua/politics/mid-ukrainy-shokirovan-razgulom-rossiyskih-neofashistov-v-rf-1-maya-144311_.html i ca n't deny that we have shady characters among our mps , but let 's compare : * ukrainian mps have beaten up a director of govenment tv station for spreading fud during revolution * russian mps have unilaterally supported ** military annexation ** of part of ** another independent country ** . 
  i 'll leave to others to decide which one can be called nazism/fascism/whatnot .
