   almost 80 years ago same mistake was maken . 
  i 'm not sure i 'm following . 
  are you trying to compare putin to stalin or what ? 
   how much ppl has died ? 
  i do n't know . 
  tell us , do n't leave us hanging . 
   wan na try again ? 
  i guess russia is already trying . 
  but no , ukraine does n't want to , sorry . 
   forcibly changed the composition of the government i guess it was maidan , not verkhovna rada who [ voted ] ( http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=50002 ) . 
  oh wait , it says 331 mps voted in favor . 
  probably they were all under gun point ? 
  let 's check the [ pictures ] ( http://www.pravda.com.ua/photo-video/2014/02/27/7016541/ ) . 
  no gunmen ? 
  probably photoshopped . 
   they are well past the stage of peaceful protest and beautiful `` democracy '' . 
  those bastards , initiating fire and killing innocent militiamen . 
  they [ started by killing militiamen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_people_killed_during_euromaidan#identified_victims ) so they had to retort . 
  wait , first protesters died from gunshot wounds on january 22nd , first militiamen on february 18th . 
  well , this must be western propaganda !, 
   new movements similar to their what their own was ah yeah , the peaceful protests of [ unarmed men ] ( https://twitter.com/adagamov/status/462124892071415808/photo/1 ) in crimea , donbass and slobozhanschina . 
  alrighty then . 
  this is incorrect . 
  he 's an acting ( interim ) president , with authority given according to constitution by elected parliament . 
  the previous president fled the country and in layman 's terms , have n't showed up at work , thus leading to current acting president being instated . 
  ukraine does n't need 20k conscripts every year , who have to endure `` dedovshchina '' , get very little nutrition and most importantly never get to actually train as soldiers there . 
  ukraine needs a small , mobile , professional army with modern equipment and educated people in charge of it . 
  this can never be done if resource are allocated for training and supporting freaking conscripts . 
  also , if the war breaks out now this law has zero impact . 
  so what 's the point ? 
  this picture is from * at least * 2011 : http://newsland.com/news/detail/id/805504/ you can always search for images on google , to verify the picture 's age . 
  he was declared wanted by ukrainian police on 28th of february . 
  so yes , he was wanted by state and no , your implications are wrong . 
  since a lot of people have already blamed his death on russia 's government , i 'll just note that he was part of organized crime group and has been [ wanted by ukrainian police ] ( http://ua.korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/3313058-proty-sashka-biloho-yakyi-pobyv-prokurora-porushyly-spravu ) for beating up public prosecutor in rivne since 28th of february . 
  he was shot by ukrainian police officers during his arrest ( he opened fire at them ) : http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/03/25/7020191/, 
  what a load of bollocks . 
   * vice prime minister one of three vice prime ministers , responsible for * humanitarian * politics . 
   * minister of defence * interim * minister of defence . 
   * ~ ~ minister of finance ~ ~ incorrect , it 's [ oleksandr shlapak ] ( http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a8%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%bf%d0%b0%d0%ba_%d0%9e%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%81%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b4%d1%80_%d0%92%d1%96%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%96%d0%b9%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%87 ) , who is not a member of any political party . 
   * ~ ~ minister of european integration ~ ~ ukraine does n't have a ministry of european integration . 
   * ~ ~ national council of security ~ ~ if you 're talking about the secretary of nation council of security , it 's [ andrii parubii ] ( http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9f%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%83%d0%b1%d1%96%d0%b9_%d0%90%d0%bd%d0%b4%d1%80%d1%96%d0%b9_%d0%92%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%87 ) , member of `` bat ` kivshchina '' party . 
   * general prosecutor * interim * general prosecutor . 
  it 's all ukrainians ' hope that he will prosecute his fellow party members without any subjectiveness . 
   * ~ ~ head of anti-corruption bureau ~ ~ what 's that ? 
  i 'm not aware of anti corruption bureau in ukraine ( there were attempts to create one , unsuccessful ones )  * minister of ecology correct . 
   * minister of agriculture correct . 
   * ~ ~ minister of education ~ ~ and we 're back to wrong . 
  [ sergii kvit ] ( http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9a%d0%b2%d1%96%d1%82_%d0%a1%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b3%d1%96%d0%b9_%d0%9c%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%87 ) is a head of kiev-mogyla academy , with philosophy doctorate . 
   * ~ ~ minister of sports ~ ~ no , wrong . 
  [ dmytro bulatov ] ( http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%91%d1%83%d0%bb%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b2_%d0%94%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%82%d1%80%d0%be_%d0%a1%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b3%d1%96%d0%b9%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%87 ) , no party membership . 
  to summarize : * out of 11 positions you claimed only 5 are taken by svoboda party members * of those 5 , only 3 have permanent positions * of those 3 , only one has any real * economic * power , the minister of agriculture igor shvaika . 
  what 's your agenda here ? 
  or are you just * that * clueless ? 
  disclaimer : i do n't like svoboda and hope that do n't get over the 5 % limit during the next verkhovna rada elections . 
  article 37 of crimean constituion . 
  crimean parliament elects and appoints crimean premier minister . 
  there 's no `` governor '' in crimea . 
  even armenia , georgia and moldova ? 
  ukrainian parliament indeed has the power to disband crimean parliament based on ukrainian constitution article 85 section 28 provided constitutional court has a conclusion that crimean parliament has broken ukrainian constitution ( that has happened on thursday ) . 
  disbanding crimean parliament would only lead to re-elections , so i 'm not sure how that would make crimean constitution irrelevant . 
  can you explain your line of thinking there ? 
   dynamo kiev is even considered a russian club . 
  oh really ? 
  never knew that . 
  got ta tell my fellow dk fans . 
  russian was never a state language . 
  the law in question is in fact about `` regional '' languages , but was never implemented in real life because the only reason it was voted on was political -- to turn the attention away from huge economical downturn in ukraine in 2013 . 
  and crimea operates in tri-lingual system anyway ( pros of being * autonomous * republic ) , where every official document is published in ukrainian , russian and crimean tatar languages . 
  russian is a primary language at schools and universities and ukrainian is taught as a foreign language mostly . 
  tatar language is rarely taught at schools . 
  so , the situation in crimea is : russian is the major language , ukrainian is considered a foreign language and crimean tatar is taught only amongst crimean tatars . 
  no far-right political party can change this situation because it 's based on crimean constitution and verkhovna rada ca n't change it without crimean verkhovna rada voting on said change . 
  * obviously * that was a rounding error . 
  works for me though . 
  anyway , here 's the text :  as us condemns crimean vote , russian tv host kiselyov warns : `` russia is the only country capable of turning the u.s. into radioactive dust . '' here 's a video of kiselev saying that : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knyjgi2drva, 
   unless putin can somehow seriously convince the russian people that they are suffering economically and it 's entirely the west 's fault , he 's done . 
  but that 's exactly what 's happening already . 
  most recent example : https://twitter.com/mashadanilova/status/445265652853800960, 
  my wife is from crimea and her sister 's classmate wore a ribbon with a ukrainian flag on friday -- the boy got beaten up for that and the ribbon was ripped apart and spit on . 
  for 23 years crimea was a peaceful place , where most of the problems were from drunk tourists and now you see hate , pure hate to all things non-russian . 
  fuck this . 
  and fuck russia . 
  which shipyards ? 
  the biggest shipyards in ukraine are in mykolaiv and kherson , not crimea . 
   signing an * trade agreement * with the * customs union of belarus , kazakhstan , and russia * , is path to * russian * integration . 
    on paper this agreement looks nice for the people who dont look into it . 
  if you look futher you will see some demands that will put ukraine in bankruptcy and sociaal collapes within months . 
    some of the quirements are double the tariffs for housing and utilities , dramatically devalue the national currency , minimize budget expenses , cancel government support for the agricultural sector , freeze salaries , pensions , and social allowances . 
  dont forget the high gas prices that will shutdown companies . 
    ask yourself , why does the * russian federation * put so much effort in this agreement ? 
  its not because thet care about the people , its because they have their own agenda , they will get what they want over the back of the ukrainian people  ftfy . 
  look how easy it is to argue about things without providing any proofs whatsoever . 
  reinstate the export limit and hamper ukrainian grain exports ? 
  what would be the logic behind such a decision ? 
  and what do you mean by `` reinstate '' , what 's the original limit are we talking about ? 
  i could understand your claim regarding `` controlling '' army , even though igor tenuykh is only an acting minister of defence , but your claim that svoboda somehow controls police and legal system are just out of control . 
  police minister is arsen avakov from batkivshchina party and legal system is well , not controlled by government and is quite certainly independent ( it 's definitely corrupt , but svoboda party is definitely not capable of bribing the whole legal system ) . 
  btw , what are your news sources ? 
  you 're not the first dutch person claiming that majority of ministers in new ukrainian government are fascist , xenophobic and racist . 
  and yet it 's still not a profitable region .
