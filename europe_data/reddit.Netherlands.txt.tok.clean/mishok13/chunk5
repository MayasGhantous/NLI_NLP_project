  how is it untrue ? 
  here 's another link with a map ( bonus : it 's a map with a legend ) http://nashigroshi.org/2014/01/21/rejtynh-rehioniv-hoduvalnykiv-ukrajiny-na-pershomu-mistsi-poltavschyna/ the only `` profitable '' regions are dnipropetrovsk , poltava and kharkiv . 
  that 's true . 
  but as the last few days show , law is not an obstacle to aksyonov and his massive amount of supporters ( 4 % at last crimea elections ) . 
  some background : i 'm ukrainian , born and raised in kyiv . 
  my wife is of greek/ukrainian/russian ancestry , born in evpatoria , grew up in simferopol . 
  to answer the question : i 'm against secession in principle and would oppose it in any legal way possible . 
  my wife and most of her friends and family would also be against secession . 
  both of us would vote `` no '' if a question of secession was ever raised at national referendum . 
  that 's the gist of our view . 
  the secession is not possible in the current legal framework without a nation-wide referendum . 
  so all the talks right now are just that -- talks . 
  a lot of pro-secession people bring up the current government as an example of illegal decision , however strictly by the letter of the law it 's absolutely legal : the parliament is in charge of electing the government . 
  the only questionable decision is assigning turchinov as the interim ( ? ), 
  president , since that relies on a law that states that the current president has to `` unable '' to fulfill his executive duties . 
  it 's a debatable topic , whether a president that flees the country and has no contact with any of the governing bodies for more than 10 days can be considered an acting president . 
  even then , the assignment of turchinov is done by the letter of the law . 
  referendums , decisions to secede are breaking existing laws , including the most important one -- the ukrainian constitution . 
  everything beyond that should be considered by authorities under criminal or administrative law . 
  additionally , there are consequences . 
  crimea is hugely dependent on ukraine and a lot of people claiming `` russia will save us '' do not even understand what they 're getting into . 
  crimean economy is built on two sources of income : tourism and ports . 
  the latter will become obsolete , since russia is not interested in shifting its trade in black sea to crimea from novorossiysk . 
  the former is already fucked for next few years * even if situation resolves peacefully * . 
  this means that most people in crimea are going to suffer economically * already * and their support of ahem '' \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430 '' is only hurting them . 
  if crimea secedes , ukraine 's government will probably try to block water supply ( crimea is basically waterless and the north-crimean canal from dnipro is supplying at least 80 % of drinking water in crimea ) . 
  the same goes for energy supplies ( crimea is too short on power plants ) , gas , food , infrastructure , etc. 
  basically , russia would need to : * build a water canal from kuban to crimea . 
  do n't forget that crimea is separated from russia by kerch straight , which means you have a tremendous engineering feat in order to pipe water to crimea . 
  * build a huge bridge that would at least connect krasnodar with crimea * build electricity , gas , communications for new region of russia all of these things are tremendously expensive and even if russia is willing to spend those , they will run into their main obstacle : crimean tatars . 
  now , if you 're willing to bargain with them , good luck -- crimean tatars have one of the best diplomats in their leadership , but they also dislike russia just enough to make sure they ca n't be simply paid off . 
  they will want land . 
  and we 're not talking about some land in siberia , we 're talking about top level land -- the south coast of crimea . 
  that 's a great pretext for a war similar to chechen war . 
  i hope i 'm wrong , but it seems that russia will accept the secession of crimea and will also accept it as a new territory , as if only to not * actually * do that , leaving crimea a russian territory on paper and later on using that as a blackmail instrument in case ukraine wants to join eu , nato or any other multi-country anti-russia ( in russia 's opinion ) organization . 
  it seems that bild really likes stories about [ frankfurt airport and eastern europeans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuriy_lutsenko#incident_at_frankfurt_airport ) . 
  wonder how much time is it going to take bild to retract their report this time . 
  situation in crimea is nothing like catalonia or scotland : there 's no independence movement , but a movement to join russia . 
  just saying . 
  no , i do n't narrow stupidity to one nation -- stupid people are found everywhere . 
  but my friends and acquaintances who raised safety concerns are mostly people with higher education so one would assume they 're smart enough to distill true facts from russian media coverage but alas . 
  as far as `` been in ua '' part ... 
  i 've `` been in ua '' for 25 years of my life , since birth and i still have ukrainian passport . 
  and yes , i still communicate with my ukrainian friends constantly . 
  this has nothing to do with the discussion however . 
  i evaluate ukrainian , russian , dutch , us and english media on the current protests and russian media ( \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f 24 in particular ) has more bias than the most pro-russian media in ukraine . 
  so far , at least . 
  i 'm glad this fud campaign is starting to get some coverage in english-speaking media . 
  however , the russians are getting brainwashed and do n't even notice this . 
  i 've already heard complaints from russians that ukraine is now a dangerous place for russians and that you can get killed by simply speaking russian in kyiv . 
  this shit works in russia , because there 's almost no other coverage besides the government media . 
  russian-speaking ukrainians in kyiv , lviv , zhytomyr and other cities are mostly in favor of getting rid of lenin statue . 
  it was explained multiple times today already : the attack with bulldozer was organized by unknown provocateurs and was not approved by opposition leaders . 
  those attempts failed and berkut decided to counter attack , beating up [ journalists ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/12/01/euronews-cameraman-beaten-by-police-in-kiev-clashes/ ) and [ reporters ] ( http://news.liga.net/photo/politics/933680-poboishche_na_bankovoy_fotoreportazh.htm#13 ) in the process . 
  so , in summary : 200k protesters ( numbers reported by opposition are closer to 500k ) , one incident caused by provocateurs , overall quite peaceful protest . 
  jfyi , there are military bases near lviv , there 's constant presence of military equipment . 
  i was just pointing out that the fighters against bolshevik and nazi rule ( oun-upa ) were extremely xenophobic and * against * poles in ukraine . 
  the region is hardly the reason poland has very good relationship with ukraine . 
  the actual reasons are rather complicated and can not be simplified to `` galychyna used to be part of poland '' . 
  that region had lots of tensions with poles , actually : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia so , uhm , yeah . 
  there 's a lot of bad history between poles and ukrainians . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but i was under impression that kennismigranten with 30 % ruling have to pay for inburgeringscursus . 
  and volksuniversiteit is definitely not free ( in amsterdam , at least ) . 
  i 'll stick to watching sesaamstraat and trying to speak dutch wherever i can for now . 
  you obviously never lived in netherlands . 
  dutch people will switch to english as soon as they feel that you 're having a hint of trouble speaking dutch or have an accent , thus making your first foray into language an incredibly hard one . 
  it 's also quite an expensive language to learn -- a bill for 10 lessons of dutch is easily 300 + euros , and obviously you need more than 20 hours of lessons to learn a language ( which you ca n't even practice properly in your everyday life until you get to a certain level ) . 
  this creates a unique situation , where expats * choose * not to learn dutch , because there 's little gain in doing so . 
  from what i can gather from other expats living in france , germany , spain and italy , it 's almost a necessity to know local language there . 
  in netherlands you will have no troubles at all with just english ( bar calling belastingdienst , but most expats just hire tax advisor instead ) . 
  to say that expats ( kennismigranten , specifically ) that do n't know dutch do not in fact contribute to the host country is just ... well , it 's a very weird statement , to say the least . 
   and even in this crisis our economy is running quite strong . 
  erm , [ not ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/menu/themas/macro-economie/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2013/2013-09-27-03-ne-s.htm ) [ really ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/menu/themas/macro-economie/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2013/2013-052-pb.htm ) . 
  also , gdp has been in decline for [ a while now ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?vw=t&amp;dm=slen&amp;pa=81171eng&amp;d1=1-3,8-13,15-17&amp;d2=0-1&amp;d3=%28l-11%29-l&amp;hd=110623-1111&amp;hdr=t&amp;stb=g1,g2 ) ( 4 quarters in a row ) . 
  on the whole , netherlands are experiencing a recession in the middle of progressive recovery of its neighbors . 
  `` your father '' is a great anecdotal experience . 
  let me give you another anecdotal experience : my father was not allowed to stay in kiev after finishing university and had to move to cherkassy for 8 months to work . 
  oh , yes , he had options . 
  two , to be sure -- other one being gorlovka . 
  so that pretty much sums up the `` freedom of movement '' . 
  or `` freedom of choice '' for that matter . 
  the funny thing is that my mom ( already married at that time ) was n't allowed to leave kiev . 
  fortunately , my dad decided to go for phd thus securing a permit to reside in kiev until the end of his studies . 
  fortunately , ussr fell apart by that time . 
  but hey , your anecdotal experience proves a point much better , amirite ? 
  well , during their concert in amsterdam david tied dutch flag to his penis . 
  no banning of bhg from netherlands occured , however . 
  are you implying that only explorers can be cartographers ? 
  and are you implying radefeld was n't a cartographer ? 
   if asked kindly as a woman should  as a woman should  woman should fuck . 
  you . 
  check out http://www.poopsenders.com/, 
  amsterdam , florence , barcelona , london , prague, 
  read carefully : the prices fell 6.76 % in __ one year __ . 
  over the past 4 years the house prices fell by 20-35 % depending on the region . 
  inflation in combination with stagnating economy has caused the average disposable income to [ drop sharply ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/menu/themas/macro-economie/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2013/disposable-household-income-dramatically-down.htm ) . 
  so far , inflation is not helping with housing market recovery , but even making it worse . 
  now back to your original argument : how will increase of inflation help resolve drop of real estate prices ? 
  ok , so you say it 's a known fact . 
  any links to relevant reports or studies ?
