a per capita breakdown would be more informative . 
  [ yes , there is . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bible_belt_%28netherlands%29 ), 
  cool thanks . 
  do we have a source for all this ? 
  about 30 % of eu employees is older than 50 ( [ source , pdf ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/docs/hr_key_figures_en.pdf ) ) and my guess is that this group just wants to have ` some program to surf on the internet ' . 
  i had turkish colleagues and they told me that the first time they heard dutch they thought someone was throwing up . 
  it is a fascinating [ language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basque_language ) . 
  peep show it crowd, 
  yeah , more like a spoild teenager who spends daddy 's entire allowance on drugs after which he looses all direction and starts hanging out with the neo nazis and than with some popular comunist cult . 
  but hey , he 's already 18 and can do whatever the fuck he wants . 
  greece doesnt want to take resposability but rather play the underdog wile the rest of europe keeps paying off greeces debt . 
  it is quite simple indeed . 
  yeah , the one in which i can read all about the wirtschaftswunder . 
  yes . 
  because it is not for the other eu countries to choose their fucking governement . 
  they are souvereign nation . 
  the reason that the other heads of state + troika went crazy is because the new greek government tried to roll back all previous agreements . 
  no , because they acted wisely unlike the greek politicians who behave like a bunch of first class clowns . 
  bullshit anachronistic argumentation ... 
  equivalent : because crusades catholic church should pay back people from countries wherever the fuck they killed back then . 
  people get the government they deserve . 
  if they vote for corrupted and incompetent officials that ruin their country than yes its their own goddamn fault . 
  it 's called democracy . 
  it seems that greece invented it in better days . 
  edit : ok paying off dept is not direct money for economy but it really should increase trust for investors thereby boosting the economy which did not happen because of corruption and incompetence . 
  if you want to compare post-war germany with current day greece you are fucking delusional . 
  moreover , germany paid reparations . 
  want , need , semantics . 
  fact of the matter is that there already has been 300 bn euro pumped in that economy of which 100 bn has already been written off . 
  if they really needed it they would have been more careful so i think * want * is ther right verb here . 
  yep , europe should cut its losses . 
  that money can be written off . 
  mmm ... speaking for me personally , i do n't trust a word greek officials promise . 
  i think all money lent to greece will be lost , it will never be repaid even with a moratorium . 
  i think they are taking the absolute piss . 
  i think europe needs to cut its losses . 
  or just , you know , a grexit . 
  no , no , no i mean from my couch . 
  i dont want to go out in the heat man . 
  wow , i want some free money too !, 
  were can i hold up my hand ? 
  incorrect . 
  in 600 bilion years , when she has reached her final form , it will be in the shape of an all usurping hypersphere , radiating beams of crystal light . 
  it will be glorius !, 
  does n't matter . 
  she ca n't die anyway . 
   you can not have a single currency but then have multiple banks with their own agenda 's manipulating it . 
  this what the ecb is for . 
   according to mainstream media , the current economic crisis in greece is due to the government spending too much money on its people that it went broke . 
  the reason greece is broke is that no one pays their taxes . 
  mmm ... i do n't trust them , 
  with a weak euro they can import cheap european quality goods , for one . 
  eu export to us is higher than import : http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/united-states/, 
  neither is eu . 
  no , us benefits from a weak ez when greece is kept in . 
  to me it seems like an act of cowardness . 
  first you create a total caos by rejecting every offer being made without any resonable counter-offer . 
  then you/your party holds some smoke-and-mirrors referendum and give people some false sense democracy . 
  worse even , you tell people what to vote for . 
  people vote for it in the hope you will drag them through it . 
  then you say : well because the evil troika does n't like me i step down , good luck with the rest of your lives . 
  tldr : create caos then run away from it for some bullshit reason . 
  i probably don \u00b4 t. 
  but if he , as the football god he once was , is voting for qatar , a country so far removed from everything that is football , than that seems completely spineless and corrupted to me . 
  wow than it is even more pathetic ... if platini is that spineless than i am sure he would n't say no to a bit money under the table either . 
  platini is as bad as they come ... http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/10871065/qatar-world-cup-2022-france-embroiled-in-corruption-scandal.html and his son is now ceo of [ burrda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burrda ) , a qatar sportswear company . 
  i do n't know ... i think uefa is just as corrupt . 
  because nobody ever wrote about raf , eta or ira right . 
  or when the ideologues find out that it is just a pyramid scheme . 
  spoken as a true captain of industry ^ tm . 
  so hollande 's plan came together ... 1 ) insult putin 2 ) putin cancels trip 3 ) long weekend with the mistress, 
  imma not gon na finish ... 
  i call insurance scam . 
  ray kurzweil is a fucking imbecile and a charlatan and before i attach any meaning to what that clown is saying i will first need a double lobotomy . 
   a century ago , there would be a battle that wiped out the next village , you 'd never even hear about it . 
  does he seriously mean ww i. 
  sure, 
  so what is a civilized country in your opinion ? 
  so , in your opinion france is uncivilized ? 
  give me a break man . 
  is there also a page where they admit when critism on the eu was actually justified ? 
  something in the line of incompetence to deal with refugees , austerity measures that do fuck all , bureaucratic over-regulation , back room lobbying by multinationals just to name a few . 
  nice !, 
  i di n't realize that !, 
  edit : i think i might have fixed it . 
  i like you too , 
  | genocide | in germany | in turkey | | : ----------- | ------------ :| : ------------ :| | ** recognized by germany ** | yes | yes | ** recognized by turkey ** | yes | no ^ ^ i ^ ^ hate ^ ^ myself ^ ^ sometimes ^ ^ too . 
  of course it is . 
  hungary and slovakia have deep and historic political and cultural roots with russia . 
  this is not the case with the countries in the western influence sphere . 
  what a load of nonsense by this cia ~ ~ guy ~ ~ gal . 
  in the netherlands , populist parties are on a steady rise since pim fortuyn ( early 2000 's ) . 
  this has absolutely nothing to do with russian interference but has everything to do with the complete incompetence of the established parties to find a proper answer to the populist voice . 
  also i would like to see some proof that putin made a financial deal with wilders ( pvv , netherlands populist party ) . 
  edit : ok , it is true that a populist platform was successful in organizing and winning a referendum against the eu association treaty with the ukrain . 
  something that russia probably would like . 
  however i really do n't think that pro-russian sentiments or propaganda drove people to vote against this treaty but rather the corruption and instability of ukraine itself . 
  that and a rising euroskepticism , also for a great part inflicted by the eu itself . 
  we give putin too much credit for the mess we have inflicted on ourselves .
