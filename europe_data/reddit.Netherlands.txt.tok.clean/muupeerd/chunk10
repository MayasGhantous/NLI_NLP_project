  you gon na pull that viking crap on us again ? 
  our bretherns !, 
  so there are others that enjoy our delicious liquorice i never knew . 
  so do we . 
  russia pretending it 's still a super-power . . 
  neighbouring countries like belgium or germany , other then that denmark . 
  any country with secular , down to earth , nice people would suffice . 
  because that would be racist silly . 
  kurdish get more rights ? 
  i can only assume this has something to do with the iraqi autonomous kurdistan and the recent succesfull actions of kurdish ypg fighting off mainly islamist rebels ( supported by turkey ) carving out a syrian kurdistan step by step . . 
  giving them more rights could be an attempt to keep the 16 million kurds of turkey quiet . 
  any turkish kurds here that can expand on this ? 
  travelling with a caravan is usually more for the older generation , youngsters usually can be found everywhere on the planet , even the most remote places . 
  poland never really took part in the colonisation thingie ? 
  the government did n't but the people certainly did . 
  [ polish diaspora ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_diaspora ), 
  but you have a tunnel ; o, 
  do n't be silly your idiots are here . . 
  in a neat place where the jail time is now and where criminals are victims that need help . 
  your crime rates are dropping . 
  aww look at the puppet dance . 
  now seriously , i used to be anti-royal , but i do n't see nothing wrong having this guy as a '' figurehead '' for the state . 
  he 's well educated and seems to be smart , i do think we get some money back from the royals in terms of making deals with other countries . 
  having the politicians be figureheads of the country is well . . ehh , lets just say i when i think of italy i still think of berlusconie . 
  but , the spending on them has to go down by a lot . 
  these folks are rich enough that they could live like '' kings '' on the interest of their savings alone . . on the actual speech . . fuck them , there have been plenty of failures privitisationing everything . . 
  it seems they see it as the answer to everything while it will work wonders in some cases it can work out disastrous on others . 
  nope , not any time soon . 
  - it 's 80 million population ( like germany ) would give way to much voting power for what they are worth . 
  it 's for the most part , though beautiful , still a very backward country . 
  it would in my opinion would hold europe backwards with old values . 
  we will see if the protests will make in difference . 
  - journalistic freedom is very very bad . 
  - it still has halve of cyprus under siege - the whole mess with armenia war/nations borders , ( and the armenian genocide , damnit just admit it . . ) - i foresee some problems arising with the kurds . 
  - a very small part is technically european . 
  what is european anyway ? 
  the frisians do their politics in dutch , i 'm sorry but i see no problem here . 
  awesome thanks !, 
  yea . . tell me your secrets oh great one . 
  how did thou do that ? 
  not as many as english , but figured it was about european languages . 
  the 49 % can learn the language or translate , although i imagine the number is lower then 49 in the parliament . 
  scrapping all local language support would be a step to big , and is one i do not plea for . 
  symbolically putting it in english seems like a good first step . 
  he has got what was coming for him . 
  [ the motherfucker !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbsa26tpwlk ), 
  can relate i like the cold , rain and mild summers . 
  how about stop talking about what languages are taught and which ones are official in what countries , but lets start talking how many people in the eu speak what languages : official languages . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_european_union ) language | first language | additional language | total : -- | : -- :| : -- :| : -- : english | 13 % | 38 % | 51 % german | 16 % | 11 % | 27 % french | 12 % | 12 % | 24 % italian | 13 % | 3 % | 16 % spanish | 8 % | 7 % | 15 % polish | 8 % | 1 % | 9 % romanian | 5 % | 0 % | 5 % dutch | 4 % | 1 % | 5 % hungarian | 3 % | 0 % | 3 % and lets not forget 1800 million people can speak english world wide , 500 million spanish and 500 million french . 
  much of academia is in english and it 's quite easy to learn , next to that the younger generation ( or future generation ) is probably more fluent in english then older people . 
  so really i see no problem why not to just use english as the language to use in the eu scale , while resorting to the native languages on a national scale . 
  how about libya ? 
  europe was pretty quick to bomb the shit out of it when an uprising started , must have had some reason for doing so . 
  it 's oil reserves are quite big . 
  in for a penny in for a pound . 
  i had an aunt that always had asthma and trouble with her airways etc , she went on vacation in rural norway and it 's pine forests and immediately all her problems disappeared , until she got back off course ... so yea . . 
  well [ randstad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/randstad ) , [ flemish diamond ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flemish_diamond ) and [ rhine-ruhr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhine-ruhr ) are fully visible . 
  especially the cities rotterdam and antwerpen . 
  the scarcity is created by government legislation . 
  winter is coming ... better get some extra locks and hide thy copper . 
  meanwhile the romanians here are getting a comfortable chair and some popcorn , the show will begin in january . . 
  * to patrol that effectively you 'd need millions of soldiers ... * or a shitload of drones + radar surveillance . 
  +1 , to add things : - lonely planet books are also good - if you look for a restaurant avoid premium locations like the headstreat and head to the side streets and allys . 
  - ask a local , preferably a student . 
  ( usually knows basic english and will more likely be honest and know some real good spots ), 
  a source for that claim would be lovely , i know to little on the subject to judge it . 
  all of the north european countries are somewhat socialist , and are among the wealthiest and best places to live on earth . 
  the importance is to find the balance . 
  there is . 
  the money comes from tax payers working in the netherlands , mostly from dutch citizens ( who consist of 20 % + non ethnic dutch mind you , its not a ethnic problem but one of paperwork and geography ) . 
  the rules once implemented are for a country with a closed border , while nowadays with open borders everyone can simply get in and most can work and get access to certain benefits . 
  i suggest that , before you can receive benefits from the government you have to have worked for an x number of years in the netherlands , or require a dutch passport . 
  we have to reward the immigrants that wish to work here , not those that come to live off the work of others - only then does a socialistic state work . 
  a socialistic state with benefits based upon nationality and geography closed border , that willfully hands out benefits to other nationalities and citizens which do not reside in the country . . is fully open for abuse . 
  honestly this is just the tip of the iceberg , it 's about time they started to clean the mess . 
  almost nothing except , balkan & islam . 
  so it 's good to read these comments . 
  awesome music !, 
  i 'm a big fan of it .

  since i 'm seeing a lot of flat bread types i will add this one : [ pannekoek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pannekoek ) pannekoek with syrup , sugar , jam or my favorite : chocolate paste with strawberries/banana . 
  and a related one : [ poffertjes !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poffertjes ) eaten with butter and powdery sugar . 
  and a real bread type : [ krentenbollen ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/krentenbol ) ( ps , hungarians , there is this type of bread/cookie that where the dough is wrapped around a slowly turning hot iron pipe and then flavored with sugar , cinnamon or vanilla , what is it called ? 
  i ate is ferociously when i was in hungary ), 
  who votes for erdo/akp ? 
  which group of people ? 
  old , young , educated or not , religious or not ? 
  are the secularists a majority at this point ? 
  are the other competing parties more or less secular then the akp ? 
  anyone here that can answer some of these questions  ? 
  to me it seems like some weirdly exotic nordic country , do n't know any negative things about it . 
  if ww3 ever comes that is where i will go . 
  not many things are as bad ass as suomi vs ussr * . 
  awesome photo 's . 
  good .
