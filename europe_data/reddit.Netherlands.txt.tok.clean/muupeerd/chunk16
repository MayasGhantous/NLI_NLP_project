  do you share the same worldview as the women you try dating do ? 
  ( reason why i ask this , is because i experienced some indian migrant for example that claimed to be western but end up being patriarch assholes that expect western women to have sex with them because they are western women and they are a man ) do you aim too high maybe ? 
  do speak with an accent or dress like the typical usually brown-ish gangster ? 
  have you asked friends about this or for advice ? 
  they know you better then we do . 
  have you asked some of the women you have dated for a deadly honest answer why it seems so difficult for you ? 
  now for the rest in the netherlands : marriages especially between middle-eastern men and native women have a very high chance of failing within 10 year . 
  the middle eastern often do n't mix and seek a partner from their own ethnic group , however they like to practice on '' whorish '' natives . 
  only 1 in 20 of this group will seek a native partner , this is very low and any other ethnic group is higher than this . 
  there are bad stereotypes off course , many with a core of truth . 
  had male friends dating middle eastern women , all fine and dandy , but cultural differences make it difficult . 
  especially the family , it 's there where it breaks . 
  turks are more moderate but also a lot more nationalistic . 
  it 's power projection , a power play . 
  basically a turkish imam will take it 's place and turkify the people going there . 
  it 's a trick turkey and saudi arabia play everywhere in europe , financing mosques and placing their own imams in there . 
  this is n't just '' religion '' this is hard politics and culture being imposed on the people flocking there . 
  something perhaps we should n't want encourage too much being somewhat religious repressive dictator states . 
  if anything history tells us how far we have come this last century , i naively want to believe we can say the same at the beginning of the next century . 
  i mean [ slavery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery ) , [ serfdom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serfdom ) , [ famines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/famine ) , [ genocides ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_genocides_by_death_toll ) and [ segregation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racial_segregation ) . 
  i mean they still exist in same way or another but it 's unimaginable from what is has been . 
  you would be surprised how many mosques are inciting violence in europe . . 
  the amount of guest speakers invited that incite it is quite appalling . 
  the amount of ignorance in politics on it is staggering . 
  not surprising , heard the same from a polish immigrant to the netherlands . 
  very basic dutch course , mainly subsidized . 
  first lesson the majority were refugees , second lesson it was mainly poles . 
  riightt . . was explaining transylvania 's population , which ended up true , gosh what a dilemma , time to overblow it and ignore it while playing the race card . 
  i do demand your apologies . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_romania ) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_romania] from 1977 to 2011the number of hungarians ( 1,7 m to 1,2 m ) and romanians ( 19m to 16,8 m ) have been in decline . 
  the roma have been going up from 230k in 1977 to 620k in 2011 , going from 1,05 % to 3,3 % of the population , although it 's also esmiated at 8,32 % of romania 's population . 
   [ experts believe that there may be up to 11m roma people in europe today , making their population greater than austria 's or sweden 's . 
  while fertility rates are dropping to record lows in the new eu member states , roma numbers are exploding . 
  if the numbers hold , 20 per cent of hungarians and 40 per cent of the country 's workforce will be roma in 2050 -- compared to just 6 per cent in 2006 . 
  in the coming decades , the danger is that a large proportion of the eu 's population could effectively end up being deemed second-class citizens .

  it should n't exist . 
  you want to go to court , then go to court . 
  now you ought really to educate yourself what the results have been . 
  is saved really the best word ? 
  do n't forget the migrants are paying loads of money to be trafficked to europe . 
  this is very profitable for the people involved and a pretty good way to make money in an otherwise war torn country . 
  so off course they are not happy . 
  aye , especially with the bucket loads of money they are making on human trafficking . 
  the roma are making loads of babies , if the trend continues they will be the majority in 2050 or so , there are i believe a high population of roma in the transylvania area . 
  ai n't it the fucking poles ? 
  [ http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/07/03/ttip-eu-us-trade-deal-unite-union_n_5554227.html] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/07/03/ttip-eu-us-trade-deal-unite-union_n_5554227.html ) among other ways . 
  but the main idea is this : remove trade barriers and let the free market roam . 
  it will in the end make it a neccesity to remove the social state in order to be competitive against a non-social state with criminally low non-livable wages that is america . 
  well , you guys are pretty good at emigrating . 
  do n't know if there is any research on it but you poles are probably some of the most successful migrants looking at unemployment and crime rate , we will ignore the drunk driving . 
  have had the pleasure of working with a lot of you guys . 
  it was in an interview with ploumen by a dutch news program called rtl , here is a link to a letter about it , [ it 's a pdf file . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/relations/relations_other/npo/docs/netherlands/own_initiative/oi_role_of_national_parliaments_in_free_trade_agreements/oi_role_of_national_parliaments_in_free_trade_agreements_tweedekamer_reply_en.pdf ), 
  sure , but we should n't pray the price of abolishing the social state for one that favors large companies and monopolies in them over smaller ones including start-ups . 
  the european parliament has not made it clear that individual countries will be allowed to vote on it . 
  depends what part of government we are going to bind together . 
  for foreign policy towards non-eu , yes i agree for unification , for shared army i agree . 
  but for other fields ? 
  not so much . 
  the future is going to speed up , governments are already slow , big governments such as on the eu level are even slower . 
  if we are to thrive in this century we let eu member states very autonomous , so that the countries can implement policies fast and also experiment with it ( instead of one size fits all ) , so that in the end the best policies are slowly adapted by other countries . 
  think how hard it would be to get cannabis legislation done on eu level as an example ? 
  solution to counter this is exactly what politics has removed , that is to give incentives to working couples and bussiness owning couples to have kids by giving them strongly reduced kiddo-care . 
   '' research has consistently found that migrants are usually well-informed about the dangers of a particular route , but view the expected benefits of reaching their destination as worth the risks . '', 
  and tadaa , the solution : stop rewarding illegal immigration and bring them back to their home countries with negative stories without rewards . 
  then increase support for refugees in neighboring conflict countries , and increase ways for legal migration and do n't treat the migrants as superior to their new fellow country men but as equal to them , except from when they commit crimes which should decrease the chance of permanent stay . 
  select the legal migrants with some simple questions such as : do you see and treat women as equals ? 
  do you support death for apostasy ? 
  will you be part of society and work for it 's improvement ? 
  do you support a secularism ? 
  do you support tribalism ? 
  if this is done , you will actually and up with immigrants that might not actually be hated by the indigenous population , and might actually decrease racism towards brown-tinned people in europe overall . 
  it 's so fucking simple . . 
  watch this documentary : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/india%27s_daughter from my experience there exists a strong culture of viewing women as unequal . 
  there is also a tendency to catogorize women as '' good '' ( traditional ) , and '' bad '' ( modern feminist that goes out at night etc and dresses western ) . 
  then you have the way they view western women . . which is despicable . . the world may become more western and globalized but only the superficial western cultural elements are imported by these cultures , their idea of western women literally are the ones they see in video clips . 
  like literally i was shocked when being in india learning that . . 
  combine this and women are both seen as inferior and as open for sex and they should want it because they are sluts and because they are the unequal female and they are the superior men . 
  too bad organics often is n't better then conventional integrated ag ( except perhaps for animal farming ) . 
  one group does n't want to talk about it and keeps shouting bad names and morals to anyone that does , and the group other is in the extreme spectrum of the argument and wants to break the taboo . 
  look at the elections , the more '' extreme '' parties get a tremendous amount of votes for at least expressing the desire the debate it . 
  it 's about bloody time the rest of the people start with this overdue debate . 
  the threads here about it reflect politics in the real world . 
  so stop whining and participate . 
  we had a nice run , but honestly people are not that progressive anymore . 
  at least older folks and politicians are . 
  sure , look for conspiracies and hate everywhere . 
  a bit biased eh ? 
  does anyone knows what russia 's foreign policies are towards central asia and east-russia ? 
  kind of agreeing mass illegal economic immigrants by saving them , housing them and occasionally accepting them permanently and not deporting them when they are not accepting them results to more immigrants ? 
  who could possibly have predicted that ? 
  the dominant and the submissive both , the normal majority stays . 
  ah a prolonged mass suicide , well it was nice having ya . 
  now we should probably could use all that sweet future empty lebensraum . 
  it 's not a final solution true , but the country is in a civil war and there is very little '' government '' and increasingly rebel groups such as isis now that make money with human trafficking , [ hell they even threatened europe with it ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2958517/the-mediterranean-sea-chaos-gaddafi-s-chilling-prophecy-interview-isis-threatens-send-500-000-migrants-europe-psychological-weapon-bombed.html ) . 
  it 's also not only libyans but also many other nationals . 
  making it harder for these groups seems to be the aims , making it less profitable . 
  that said libya is a mess and there was already in intervention , perhaps it 's not such a bad idea to intervene further in libya .
