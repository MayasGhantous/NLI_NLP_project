   and of course banning prostitution will not stop prostitution . 
  banning rape , murder , and slavery did n't stop any of those crimes either . 
  but at least we can do something about it when we find out !, 
  nice , your comparing a victimless crime with one where there is . 
  and your saying we ca n't do anything about sex trafficking or forced prostitution ? 
  we can , because unlike prostitution those are still very illigal . 
  and because legalising prostitution brings them to the open we should be able to find them a lot faster . 
   surely , the right not to be a prostitute is more important than the right to be a prostitute . 
  if like 30 % of the prostitutes is forced into it , then the remaining 70 % has bad luck but they will have to accept that the situation is unacceptable . 
  you rather have 90 % forced in it ? 
  because that 's the way it will go to when it 's illigal . 
  another question you should ask yourself is why there are still so many that are forced ? 
  my answer would be lack of regulation and bullying by local governments ( banks , and tax agency 's ) - what would yours be ? 
  * stop the commercial rape !, 
  * start illigal rape !, 
  banning prostitution will not stop prostitution , but it will move a simple high profit risky industry underground resulting in criminal activity paired with ( gang ) violence , human trafficking and slavery . 
  it seems counterintuative but in many cases simply banning something because you do n't like it will only make the problem worse . 
  also it should be the indiviuals right to choose wether or not to protitute themselves . 
  besides that , it 's only rape when one of the 2 parties involved does n't consent to the penetration , which in case of prostitution - is not true . 
  source ? 
  you know any place to read this article ? 
  efficient ? 
  the innitional costs may be higher , but on the long run it might be more efficient ? 
  just rambling . 
  pretty much said it allready : pump a shitload of money in the economy there , every bit they spent they spent taxes on , every bit the people receiving it spents also paying tax , and on and on . 
  ha touche , allright the ones that add no value and only take it . 
  i do n't care about the people circulating for work , i only care about the ones that do n't work , do n't care about language and do n't care about integrating - that only care about benefit tourism , people that add no value at all and go about living on others work . 
  1 million retirees all receiving pensions from their own country as well as having savings that they use to live in the country , bringing a lot of money with them as well . 
  even if these 1 million retirees would only spent 100 euro 's a month in spain they would already be spending 100 million . 
  and that 's excluding the money they invested in property and visits from family . 
  very well , so basically the elites of the countries want to join the eau - or the oligarch-union . 
  so they can further accumulate more wealth and screw over the people . 
  might have something to do with catalonia ? 
  you have n't kept track of unemployment and immigration rates ? 
  the whole '' spread democracy and were exceptional '' crap is just a stupid excuse for the masses , just read wikileaks and usa politics will dawn to more like the french one . 
  99 % is a bit high . . you have to realise at this moment india and china still have territory dispute on their border , this every now and then leads to confrontation . 
  even the border disputes with siberia and china has only ended recently ( for now ) . 
  we will see what the future brings to russia , but we have to aware that the power that once was is changing . 
  east-asia is the future play field , [ just look at the world map ] ( http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/gpw-v1/gppycpd-12in.gif ) india , china , indonesia the philipines . 
  these countries are mostly dead poor now but they are developing at a fast rate , even if they remain poorer the sheer manpower can make a big difference . 
  maybe the power losses over a global scale , in which the eu , usa and russia see them selves against new world powers urges a need to deepen relationships . 
  also lets not forget siberia is almost empty of people , but full of resources . 
  china is hungry . 
  at the same time russia strikes me as a bit unstable as well , with a small elite controlling most of it 's resources ( sadly this is happing in the us and various other european countries as well , since it seems the crisis has made the poor poorer but the rich richer ) perhaps things will change there . 
  it 's not going to happen soon , if it will then either russia has to fundamentally change ( from inside or outside threats ) and the eu has to grow a lot more , while remaining stable ( more countries , more people ) so russia 's entrance with 140m people will not cause a gigantic shift in power . 
  i think what he means is , how will the eu make a country in a stable democracy ? 
  * `` as a member of the british pakistani community myself , i 've found these comments to be offensive [ and ] divisive . 
  '' * well that says it all , deflect any critique and pass it off as offensive or racist . . maybe it 's just me but some immigrant groups seem have this honor and pride that makes them completely deflect any critique , consequently nothing gets done to improve that critique . . 
  it 's as if they want a civil war , if this law passes the chance of that happening will increase , the chance of catalunya going independent also increases . 
  well that was a depressing but very very interesting read , makes me wonder about what amsterdam holds . 
  interesting , i promise that i will search more on this later . 
  for now i really have to go back to studying . 
  and not getting the wait 5 minute messages , take some time , 
  give me some examples of how we have treated our allies like shit , do n't give me this '' your country did this wrong so everything you say is bullshit '' . 
  also give me some examples of eu abusing it 's power . 
  i 'm genuinely interested . 
  oh and ,  you should really shut the fuck up . 
  you and your shitty nation have no credibility left . 
  [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs7nqwgt4-i] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs7nqwgt4-i ) oh and also give me some examples of russia treating it 's allies with respect and helping them . 
   poverty and youth unemployment are in the hands of how the government push the austerity . 
      yeah , because those depressed economies devastated by austerity are totally capable of supporting so many young people entering the work force . 
  it 's just the matter of will , c'mon !, 
  they do n't want to have a good , functioning economy !, 
  most of the economies are devastated by their own stupid actions , if my country had any brains to begin with it would have saved up a lot of money in the years before the crisis and be spending it now , in the same way if greece had n't done some creative accounting on their economy and would n't have joined the euro it would n't be in such a big mess . 
  now besides the only reason russia has any economic activity left is the enormous amounts of natural resources it has . 
  in the case of gas it seems russia with all it 's bullying is trying very hard for any country not to buy it . 
   russia helps its allies and treats them all with respect respect and helping them ? 
  do give my some examples . 
   so take your propaganda lies and go fuck yourself . 
  well there is also the house of saud spending a lot of their oil money on mosks and imams in europe spreading the sunni-wahhabism branch of islam , [ which really is the crazy branch . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wahhabi_movement ), 
  austerity ? 
  they will when they use the same currency yes . 
  poverty and youth unemployment are in the hands of how the government push the austerity . 
  what they do n't do however is stop the gass supply in the middle in the winter and blocking imports from the country blaming it on '' food safety '' or the like because their pissed off at some stupid again , like ehm arresting a drunk child abuser who happens to be a diplomat of the said country . 
  all the while the said country is experiencing shitty economics itself ( especially on it 's rural area 's ) , is extremely corrupt and extremely unequal . . 
  yea there are a fair amount of dutch farmers heading there now buying big tracks of land and farming there  . 
  the corruption and criminality still is a very big problem though . 
  that 's quite a lot more yield , although some might be due to improvements in farming the climate that year and the amount acres sown with grains is more important . 
  damn , that 's dark . 
  well it is home to some of the best cropland on the planet - which is heavily un-utelized and often in the hands of oliegarch 's , it 's output could still double multiple times , which could lead to extra cheaper resources of food , for human consumption or vodder , bio fuels and fiber etc. 
  fun fact : during ww2 germany had a plan of rehousing 2-3 million dutch people ( already then known to be one of the best farmers in the world ) to farm ukraine . 
  there was a lot of resistence to it , and so in the time the germans got they only managed to get a small amount of farmers to voluntarily go , which often got mugged by the locals there , stripped from all their possesions and at times killed . 
  many were back in the netherlands pretty fast . 
  back to the abusive husband . 
  edit : come to think of it , russia 's foreign politics are is like having a relationship with an old russian man . 
  2 world wars and being the economic power house of europe does that for you . 
  so . . where will they get their gass from ? 
  just going to spew some quotes from the awesome book i recommend reading : 1000 years of annoying the french by stephen clarke . 
  fougeret de montbron ( 1706-60 ) , french writer and anglophile . 
  * we are the only nation in the universe that the english do not disdain . 
  instead they pay us the compliment of hating us as ferociously as possible * laurence sterne ( 1713-68 ) , irish writer * the french believe that talking of love is making it * napoleon bonaparte ( 1769-1821 ) * it is in the french character to exaggerate , to complain and to distort everything when one is not happy * * good politics is making people believe they 're free * flora tristan ( 1803-44 ) * traditionally , in france , the most esteemed member of society is woman . 
  in england , it 's the horse * georges clemenceau ( 1841-1929 ) french prime minister * english is just badly pronounced french * victor hugo ( 1802-85 ) * lets not be english , french or german any more . 
  let 's be european . 
  no , not european , lets be men , lets be humanity . 
  all we have to do is get rid of one last piece of egocentricity - patriotism * that 's enough for now . 
   one of the issues is the bizarre notion that one 's house should be an ** investment ** before a dwelling and pushes prices up artificially . 
  ** housing benefits ** and the proposed right to buy are just subsidies for the landlords to keep their prices higher than they really ought to be . 
  this exactly this !, 
  in the netherlands you have a tax on your wealth , while at the same time a tax cuts on your income and wealth when buying a house .
