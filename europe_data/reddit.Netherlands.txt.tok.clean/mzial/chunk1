granted , nuclear power can not be completely clean , but at the same time i loathe this kind of reasoning , as it assumes that the environment will be harmed by radiation . 
  oh sorry , let me clarify : i meant harm by mining / extracting fuel . 
  it * can * be done properly , but i 'm highly sceptical that will ever happen considering the costs are way higher . 
  this is one of the more subtle problems i have regarding nuclear : there is a strong incentive for everyone involved ( but not * [ everyone ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tragedy_of_the_commons ) * ) to disregard safety , ecology and enviromental issues . 
  i ca n't point out what exactly will go wrong ( and everything can be discredited with ` oh but if executed * properly * . . ' ) , but the whole environment seems to be geared towards it . 
   also : a lot of c02 gets released during the manufacture of wind turbines and solar panels . 
  see [ this article of the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/29/turbines-energy ) :  critics of wind energy often claim that the energy used to construct a wind turbine outweighs the energy produced during its lifetime in operation . 
  this is not correct . 
  an evidence review published in the journal renewable energy in 2010 , which included data from 119 turbines across 50 sites going back 30 years , concluded that the average windfarm produces 20-25 times more energy during its operational life than was used to construct and install its turbines . 
  it also found that the average `` energy payback '' of a turbine was 3-6 months . 
  a windturbine can thereby pay for 20-25 other turbines . 
  of course , this argument will also fly for nuclear reactors ( not sure , but pretty sure ) . 
  on top of it : nuclear reactors can not be recycled in the same way wind turbines and solar panels can , unfortunately . 
   as for gen iv : technology advances as quickly as society wants it to be . 
  exactly , see project manhattan and the like . 
  but this argument can also be made for energy storage solutions , pv panels and wind turbines . 
  additionally : how do you feel about nuclear fusion ? 
  would n't it be a better solution than gen iv fission reactors ? 
  anyway , i greatly prefer nuclear power over russian/american gas so we probably should n't stop building nuclear reactors . . 
  so there 's that . 
   people that were participating were just participating because it was cool , not necessarily because it was the rational thing to do . 
  got it . 
  i somewhat agree up to  build - more - reactors . 
  let rationality prevail over idiotic idealism . 
  you 're overlooking ( long-term ) costs . 
  nuclear energy is n't as cheap as many people make it out to be . 
  here 's a nice overview of [ costs per energy source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cost_of_electricity_by_source ) \u00b9 . 
  wind prevails over nuclear energy in terms of cost , with ( of course ) solar pv being one of the more expensive options . 
  please also read : [ nuclear power : still not viable without subsidies ] ( http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear_subsidies_report.pdf ) . 
  nuclear power is n't likely to get cheaper . 
  no economies at scale can exist , as not a large number of reactors have to be build in order to provide for a country 's needs . 
  this , of course , has a direct impact on the reliability of a network : only a few reactors have to fail in order for costs to skyrocket ( see : belgium ) . 
  that , and fuel costs are unlikely to diminish ( logically , as it is for all intents and purposes a fossil fuel ) . 
   what we do know is that energy consumption has been on the rise for a long time , and a few wind turbines - in contrast to what some treehuggers might believe - will not balance out the energy shortage that is looming past the horizon . 
  this is stupid . 
  [ denmark has done it for a while now ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wind_power_in_denmark ) . 
  * denmark was a pioneer in developing commercial wind power during the 1970s , and today a substantial share of the wind turbines around the world are produced by danish manufacturers such as vestas and siemens wind power along with many component suppliers . 
  wind power provided 33 % of denmark 's energy consumption in 2013 and 41 % of denmark 's electricity consumption in the first half of 2014 . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] in 2012 the danish government adopted a plan to increase the share of electricity production from wind to 50 % by 2020 . 
  * and even though denmark has one of the highest shares of renewable energy , their power grid is one of the [ most reliable in europe ] ( http://www.renewablesinternational.net/overview-of-grid-reliability-in-eu/150/537/75716/ ) . 
  all in all , renewable energy promises : * a circulation of commodities . 
  wind turbines , batteries and solar panels are or can be recyclable . 
  * no fuel dependency , or as you will `` tight integration '' . 
  it removes asymmetric relationships between producer and consumer ( france - australia [ uranium ] , europe - russia [ gas ] , western world - middle east [ oil ] ) . 
  * a much more reliable grid , as it is build for failure . 
  see denmark / germany . 
  * truly clean energy . 
  nuclear energy ( fission , that is ) can never satisfy these properties by its very definition . 
  so no , we should n't build more nuclear reactors to provide for our energy needs . 
  instead we should focus on finally getting it right by being smart about it : build a grid which does n't rely on fuels , stimulates independency ( / tight integration ) and is self-sufficient . 
  \u00b9 it does n't take demolition costs into account . 
  edit : oh and can you please stop the `` naive partners '' , `` treehuggers '' , `` idiotic idealism '' . 
  it does n't add any credibility . 
  edit2 :  i wonder why there is so little talk about generation iii , and more important , generation iv reactors . 
  because they do n't exist . 
   generation iv reactors ( gen iv ) are a set of mostly theoretical nuclear reactor designs currently being researched . 
  most of these designs , with the exception of the bn-800 reactor , are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030 . 
  that is , you * might * have one running in 2045 . 
   significantly less traumatic than [ . . ] chopping the head off with an axe how much less traumatic can it get ? 
  a chicken does n't know it 's being beheaded . 
  they do n't fight when put on a chopping block * at all * . 
  they sure as hell know they 're gargling to death when slaughtered halal though . 
  why do you even think they 're [ stunned before slaughtering ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/08/what-does-halal-method-animal-slaughter-involve ) in a lot of cases ? 
  because it fucking hurts . 
  would you rather die by being beheaded by a guillotine or by someone cutting your throat with a knife ? 
   vets say unstunned cattle take about 20 seconds ( but up to 2 minutes ) to  lose consciousness , sheep six or seven seconds ( but up to 20 ) and poultry  seven or eight seconds , but all these times can be far longer . 
  ( see link above . ), 
  i hate this discussion . 
  it should n't even be a discussion . 
  thanks . 
  is square a major player ? 
  do you think walmart will start accepting it in the future ? 
   the . 
  prices . 
  are . 
  the . 
  same . 
  i know , but you 're still paying your own flight . 
  credit card companies * force * higher prices , as merchant can not display the difference in price between goods without the fee and with it . 
  you 're essentially raising the prices of all products throughout the whole country , while disallowing any competition . 
  and i know your behaviour ( reclaiming the fees you paid ) is the most sensible thing to do , but it entirely depends on the anti-competitive practices by credit card companies . 
  if a cheaper payment system would arise , it has no change of surviving . 
  it would either have to be vastly superior ( which is unlikely ) in order for consumers to start asking merchants to accept it . 
  or consumers could benefit by all merchants deciding to adopt the new system , cutting ties with existing industries and offering lower prices . 
  both solutions are unlikely for different reasons , but the bottom line is : you 're paying your credit card companies a lot of money while simultaneously praising them for giving part of it back . 
  again , i 'm not attacking your behaviour . 
  it 's the most sensible thing to do for an individual in the face of market failure . 
  however , all-in-all it 's a stupid system and should have been outperformed by competitors a long time ago . 
  edit : have an upvote btw , 
   of course nothing is free , but i 'm not the one paying - the idiots who ca n't manage their cards properly are the ones that are making visa billions . 
  why is it so hard to see that you ca n't and do n't know what you 're paying your credit card companies ? 
  it 's a completely opaque system . 
  besides , what sense does it make to buy a product for a higher price , while enjoying other involuntary ` benefits ' later ? 
   merchants are n't allowed to charge different prices ( with the exception of gas stations ) in the us . 
  and you should be angry about it . 
  this is enforced by large corporations , making damn sure the public does n't know what they 're paying in transaction fees . 
   basically , i 've had awesome life experiences that were only possible thanks to my credit card points turning a $ 1000 flight completely free for me . 
  no , that 's stupid . 
  you already paid those thousand dollars in the form of transaction fees . 
  you 're basically saving , which you could have done without them .
