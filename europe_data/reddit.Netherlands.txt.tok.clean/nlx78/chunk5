  now i live in a suburb , which is fine . 
  but [ rotterdam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pv3dzrknec ) is nice . 
  edit : i also like the european song . 
  i 'm [ pro-europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ) it 's like a christmas song . 
  only it 's not christmas now . 
  i 'm also anti certain eu stuff . 
  but i 'm stoned now . 
  gon na play fifa , i 'm done talking . 
  that 's what i like about being single now . 
  no having to talk when i do n't want to but have to  haha, 
  yes . 
  you can leave your house now . 
  they love to bash europe and individual countries / u/criticaljenn they could not name the countries on a blind map or name more cities than london , paris and berlin . 
  yet they know our lifes suck and we live in a doomed place . 
  see the same in the donald , telling that wilders ( rightwinger from the netherlands ) will be our new prime minister next month . 
  little do they know you need 75 + 1 seats . 
  yes , he 's doing well in the polls but the other parties already excluded him to form a cabinet with . 
  and his party plus the 2nd largest party barely have 49 seats combined . 
  but they do n't care about facts . 
  it just their infowars and breitbart indoctrination that matters . 
  wilders is n't going to take over . 
  so i guess i will end up under sharia law as well / s such scary europe ... hell on earth, 
  when i posted that friday night i was stoned and drunk , did n't figure this would be a popular post . 
  i posted it cause i liked how the pic was , unfortunately there was n't such a map with the whole of europe on it . 
  it was a more a metaphor for the whole continent . 
  yes , i wished it went different but you see that after many years there are still a lot of differences between loads of countries . 
  i was fine with the original 12 or so to be honest . 
  the endless list of countries that followed was just way too quick . 
  ah well , we will see how it will pan out . 
  i liked the way the map looked . 
  could not find a larger one of this type . 
  yes . 
  on the other hand , i could have cropped it , but then it would miss certain borders or countries again , 
  ok , thanks will subscribe there . 
  those reliefs are more accurate yes . 
  also found this one which kind of looks like a [ painting ] ( http://i.imgur.com/akj2uuf.jpg ), 
  as in one continent and with the current situation in the world it 's better to stick together instead of constantly hammer on our differences . 
  the eu itself needs an overhaul . 
  keep what 's working , build of what 's not . 
  that 's true . 
  haha , yep . 
  it 's from one of those [ relief ] ( http://i.imgur.com/akj2uuf.jpg ) sites but they do look a bit high compared to the countrysize . 
  just thought it was a cool map , with the lights and all . 
  i think that later turned out to be a hoax . 
  but when i read about the idea i was excited . 
  [ here you go mate ] ( http://i.imgur.com/awkthmd.jpg ) and [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cmh9zxyhy ), 
  i like how the map looks , but i also like scrolling around in a google maps . 
  been to so many places in europe and think we should stick together , certainly now with trump as president . 
  but that 's as far a political i want to go right now . 
  we live in a beautiful continent and i feel proud , although i live in the most boring part of it :d, 
  yes . 
  but i will close it with this post i made half a week ago on some other european topic : [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5rf5g8/eu_reaches_mobile_roaming_deal_that_will_allow_eu/dd7095f/ ) `` i know there is a lot of hate towards both the eu ( and euro ) but being a shipping agent in the port of rotterdam , love to travel , live just half an hour from the belgium , 1 and a half hours from the german border ... and regulations like this + many more , i 'm pro eu . 
  but we need to deal with some serious issues first before giving it more power . '', 
  i live [ below sealevel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxvwu83nzm ) :( i wish we had mountains , so i could go skiing in the weekends !, 
  but i 'm fine with it , i feel save . 
  here is [ rotterdam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pv3dzrknec ) for example . 
  will take my shower now and go to bed . 
  had to much drinks and smokes and it 's already 3:16 in the morning . 
  sleep well , 
  i 'm stoned and drunk . 
  i spend my friday nights pretty efficient . 
  now i 'm going to listen to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiore9z5iug ) european music and be happy . 
  certainly after this [ track ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kalged64_nw ) now , good night and sweet dreams . 
  see you all tomorrow . 
  this could be in / r/wholesomememes but i just love / r/europe we are the best continent . 
  if it was n't for trump we would be . 
  but he 's rooting for america . 
  seeing this map it makes even less sense that brexit was a thing , but i do n't want to discuss that right now . 
  enjoy your weekend !, 
  greece finds greece the most trustworthy also surprised noone called us dutch most arrogant . 
  sometimes . 
  we dutch ordered joint strike fighters from lockheed martin because the european options ( eurofighter , saab gripen and some other similar fighters ) were n't as good enough and/or the european companies did not lobby that well . 
  at first i thought it was about lobbying because our government took so long to decide but the last few years i saw a lot of interviews with ( old ) commanders telling the jsf is by far the better option for the years to come .

  i actually spend quite some time in the uk when it comes to traveling . 
  often just a weekend or mid-week . 
  my dad used to work for p&o ferries on the rotterdam office , he got us free tickets to hull very often . 
  later on i worked there myself and then took friends or when i was dating a girlfriend to england . 
  i love yorkshire , but also the midlands or the liverpool area . 
  you guys have a great countryside with beautiful cliffs and hills . 
  we only have sand-dunes and flat stuff :(, 
  ah , that 's cool . 
  love the english countryside so will watch that later on this week . 
  that show the the reassembler i saw on youtube the other day , that episode where he puts back together his old miniature train set . 
  still have to check out the other episodes . 
  good tips , thanks !, 
  we receive bbc 1 , bbc 2 , bbc first and bbc world news in our stand tv package here in the netherlands . 
  the others you need to subscribe on . 
  was great growing up with all these comedies and shows that aired on the bbc . 
  this show i did n't see until yesterday . 
  in the past i sometimes watched more of these slow tv programs . 
  like billy connolly on some motorcycle or trike traveling through the uk . 
  always liked traveling and learning about other places . 
  when i was a student you had a show on german tv ( we also have some german channels in our standard tv package ) where they simply mounted a camera in front of a train and then you watch like 3 hours driving through the landscape  great when you were drunk and stoned and could not sleep yet . 
  [ example ] ( https://youtu.be/3n0byy9xdge?t=41s ), 
  but someone said she 's from a christian family . 
  who was he speaking about ? 
  i think the deleted post was about that mia khalifa person since she tops a couple top 3 spots . 
  did n't know her but i see i 'm not really into her . 
  do n't know if you can make 1 hour of beautiful tracks in nl .
