  it 's more about the cities . 
  rail away is more of a traintrack program when it comes to that . 
  i never saw it . 
  but was looking for some slow tv tonight , and this seems to fit it well , 
  i stumbled upon this show , a presenter traveling the continent by an early 19th century travel guide , by train . 
  on the bbc site it 's basically geo-blocked but this youtube user pro b uploaded the other parts as well . 
  the show is called great continental railway journeys . 
  episode 1 : [ transylvania to the black sea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhlmixwkolo ) episode 2 : [ zermatt to genoa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn57amtxu4u ) episode 3 : [ genoa to the brenner pass ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tbrgjmwjti ) episode 4 : [ riga to tampere ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysqnk0gabas ) episode 5 : this post episode 6 : [ barcelona to mallorca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_tbiive8fc ) episode 7 : [ athens to thessaloniki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bg_elbsp9g ) episode 8 : [ the black forrest to hannover ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geiamirhzy4 ) * numbers are off since the show runs for a few years now . 
  but above is from that uploader , fun to see if you like history and trains . 
  [ more episodes and also a series of this show on america ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=great+continental+railway+journeys ), 
  yes , what i forgot to mention is that it 's on articles about refugees in germany , not even the attacks itself . 
  then people will bring up they wo n't go on holiday there ( or in france for that matter ) and all seem very afraid . 
  i read the dm for fun and read the comments on other articles , but some are brainwashed by probably having only the dm as news-source . 
  i would be scared too if that 's the only thing i would read/experience . 
  i go to germany a lot and i feel perfectly safe . 
  also , the dm often reports on something , like a stabbing and then goes to report , based on rumors , it could have been done by an asylum seeker . 
  when that later turns out to be false , the damage is done and when lucky you might see a rectification the next day , somewhere on the bottom of the front page . 
  yes . 
  and then you visit the dailymail and read the comments from ( mainly ) british commentators and all the top comments are either : `` germany has been taken over . 
  not much longer before sharia law '' and `` thanks merkel '' . 
  i know many germans ( due to work , dutch myself ) and all them seem to cope just fine by rationalising it and seeing it in perspective . 
  yep . 
  bit like we know the belgi\u00eb-route in the netherlands . 
  people move to belgium for a brief moment to apply for family to be reunited or to have a partner coming from outside the eu , simply to bypass our stricter rules from some years ago . 
  then move back to nl . 
  oh yeah , i forgot about that episode  thanks . 
  i did love that show . 
  our country looks nice from above , all so planned . 
  looks very nice , been there twice . 
  in the past we had a tv show called `` nederland van boven '' / `` netherlands from above '' but i like drone video 's as well . 
  here is one of [ rotterdam , the netherlands ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pv3dzrknec ) . 
  i love to see cities from a different angle . 
  i 'm sure he posted on the_donny and thought he was edgy . 
  he would then post : i was a democrat , i now do nazi salutes in germany #kek #maga #muslimsandmexicansshouldbegassed, 
  whoowhoo , we 've finally beaten finland at something !!, 
  was in rimini in 1998 when one was spotted . 
  they closed all beaches, 
  as a dutchy i know all the french names of ingredients because our belgian brothers had to speak not only dutch but french as well . 
  we are always paired with them . 
  but often also with german and english . 
  i 've read so many label on the toilet or shower . 
  funny that / u / mentioned that . 
  it 's not like a normal war against england , france or germany . 
  ask any dutch or danish person if they think their countries went to war , i bet 8 out of 10 think not , 1 knows certain the other is just guessing  edit : i mean , i know about european countries fighting all the time , but it was really new to me that the danish and us were official in war back in the 1500 's . 
  it 's also hard to find out all the info on that i noticed . 
  ah , that 's cool of them to do that . 
  [ ca n't be mad at people when they make up for their mistake ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/005/600/its-something.jpg ) the reason i even came across that wikipage was because earlier today i wrote about dutch and danish being so mixed up a lot when it comes to capitals , areas or language . 
  i also learned they allied with us for those 2 years in 1665 . 
  i wish we would have go pro 's back then . 
  that 's some reality show right there . 
  edit : this was the topic that made me search for [ danish and dutch ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/6qa75x/dutch_soccer_player_sucker_punched_by_apposing/dkvy9i9/?context=3 ) and i now see it on the front page again , but thankfully people correct that they are [ danish , not dutch ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/peoplefuckingdying/comments/6qayp1/xpost_rfunny_dutch_soccer_player_almost_dies/dkvvqfo/ ), 
  sure was fun . 
  would watch that show with some friends after nice joint . 
  pretty amazing how steep some of them could climb for sure . 
  for me that country is synonym for driving up hills with cars  i 'm not sure what channel aired it in my country , maybe eurosport , but i remember watching [ this a lot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efe-cinhdky ) around 2000-2005 or so . 
  on the other hand , i see a lot more belgian at our coasts and parks than let 's say 20 years back . 
  so it 's coming back again , 
  for a weekend i always enjoy going to the ardennes . 
  obviously not as a remote as parts of sweden but enough nice forrest and spots to chill , hike or drive around . 
  and i like it , apart from being closeby , that it has [ hills ] ( https://media.tuicontent.nl/p/header/vakantie-ardennen.jpg ), 
  haha, 
  it 's with any capital city/2nd city tbh . 
  just ask people in munich about berlin or people in marseille about paris . 
  or in manchester about london . 
  9 out of 10 replies wo n't be positive i bet and often because of the attention from the media acting like the rest of the country does n't matter or that people in the capital city are more arrogant \u263a . 
  it always bothered me that slobodan milosevic slowed down his war crimes trial by claiming the international court of justice `` a fake tribunal '' and died before being actually punished , even though he was locked up for a good 5 years before passing away . 
  i think wikipedia is doing a great job at trying to keep it as accurate as possible and you are right about the older history that is pretty accurate . 
  the modern day history facts are n't always . 
  you have people with a certain agenda either adding or removing info . 
  over the years wiki has improved that , can remember that in 2005 or so it was pretty easy to change facts on pretty important topics . 
  they would be reverted later but then the damage might already have been done . 
  on the other hand , i do remember a sort of meme some months ago about a penguin . 
  that night the page got altered like 20 times in a row . 
  so that proves that on smaller wiki subjects it 's still easy to alter it just like that . 
  [ this , found it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/5i6ovu/slight_improvement_in_wikipedia_picture_caption/ ) edit : forgot the link to the post when it changed [ again ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/5i6ovu/slight_improvement_in_wikipedia_picture_caption/db5vc44/ ) and [ again ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/5i6ovu/slight_improvement_in_wikipedia_picture_caption/db68ikt/ ) i remember cause that was my post . 
  / u/m4mmt, 
  what saddens me equally to the loss of human lives in the middle east is the terrorist groups that destroy ancient sites . 
  just real sad . 
  i know it 's off topic , but in a way not . 
  edit : [ ngc article from 2015 ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150901-isis-destruction-looting-ancient-sites-iraq-syria-archaeology/ ), 
  thanks . 
  will see if i do a speed course in the future . 
  apart from dutch and english ( both mandatory ) from a young age , later you got french and german added , of those two languages you needed to pick at least one ( in my time on school , not sure how it works now ) . 
  i choose german because i wanted to work in transport and almost everything here in the port of rotterdam is going to germany . 
  it 's not that i hated french , but it was the least obvious choice for me back then . 
  it also helps that more and more french people learn english now as well , since when i was a kid and went to france , barely noone spoke it  thanks for the explanation on the difference of ` es ' and est ', 
  tu es un poisson  or is is ` est ' ? 
  i dropped french after 2 years in college many years back . 
  did n't want to cheat by looking it up beforehand . 
  damn , they forgot to remove that . 
  on the positive side , they do n't like being french over there , 
  i guess it will take time . 
  fewer and fewer people go to church here . 
  it 's a matter of decades before they are a very tiny majority . 
  i do n't complain about having a free day but it would indeed be nice if the majority of people actually know what the reason of that holiday is . 
  even though i 'm not religious i do try to remember what all days mean for their religion but each year you see those interviews on tv where people are being asked what happened on that day and it amazes me that ( obviously they love showing people who do n't know ) not even know what christmas is celebrating , let alone the lesser known stories . 
  i like your idea of celebrating scientists , artists and stuff , 
  yes . 
  it should be a day off . 
  i know they did try to change it every now and then .
