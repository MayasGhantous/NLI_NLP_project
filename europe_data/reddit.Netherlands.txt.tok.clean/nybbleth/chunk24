  iceland ( for one ) abolished it in 1117 . 
  portugal abolished it for the mainland and it 's indian posesssions in 1761 . 
  france abolished all slavery throughout the french world in 1794 ( though overturned when napoleon seizes power ) . 
  these are just a few of the more prominent examples . 
  there 's a bunch of empires in the ancient world that abolished it for various periods as well . 
  also , slavery itself was not abolished for the entire british empire in 1807 . 
  the act in question ( which became law in 1808 ) only abolished the * trade * in slaves . 
  it did not prohibit the owning of slaves . 
  in 1833 , the slavery abolition act fully abolished slavery in any form , but this still did not apply to the entire british empire because it made explicit exceptions for ceylon , st.helena , and the territories of the east india company . 
  it was n't until 1843 that slavery was abolished in the entire empire . 
  a whole bunch of countries abolished it before the british empire . 
   the impressive thing with the population density is that so much of the country is still uninhabited and farmland . 
  if you looked at just the randstad , the population density is crazy . 
  honestly , it 's not that crazy . 
  as a region , the ruhr area in germany is almost twice as dense ( though if we take the rine-ruhr conurbation as a whole , it 's slightly less dense than the randstad ) . 
  it 's been said that the netherlands as a whole is a densely populated country , but a sparsely populated city . 
  the randstad as a conurbation , or a megaregion with the other adjacent conurbations attached to it , is n't very dense if you liken it to a city . 
  where did you get this idea ? 
  britain was not the first to abolish slavery . 
  not even close . 
  the list of countries abolishing slavery either in practice or in law before britain did is quite long indeed . 
  you can sue the government of a country . 
  happens all the time . 
  sometimes the courts even rule in favor of the person bringing the lawsuit . 
   i wonder what a global ranking by market value rather than weight would look like ... 
  i do n't know . 
  i imagine western ports might fare much better against east-asian ports than they do in cargo/container units in such a comparison , but unfortunately i have n't been able to find the relevant data . 
  okay then . 
  we win . 
  ** belgium : ** 3 recognized/official languages . 
  official languages : 3 ( dutch , french , german ) ** netherlands : ** 6 recognized/official languages . 
  official national languages : 1 ( dutch ) official regional languages : 3 ( west-frisian , english , papiamento ) recognized regional languages : 2 ( limburgish , dutch low saxon ) belgium 's 3 official languages have the same legal status the official regional languages of the netherlands . 
  unlike the netherlands , belgium does not have an official national language . 
  so you lose either when counting national languages , or all official languages . 
  this trial by language has been won in the favor of the dutch , who now get to put their name on things for all eternity . 
  no , that just means creating deeper foundations ( which does raise cost ) . 
  given that most of that shipping is going to rotterdam , instead of any english ports , we 've decided to rename it the dutch channel . 
  this decision is final . 
   that 's only containers though , when you include all types of cargo things get a bit more complicated ... antwerp is the 2nd largest port in europe by cargo handled afaik ( but not container teu 's ) , ahead of hamburg . 
  though both of these ports are each only about as big as a third of rotterdam in cargo handled . 
  maybe if antwerp and hamburg gave up on being ports and sent all that sweet cargo over to rotterdam , we could be bigger than the chinese again . 
  make it happen !, 
  warsaw 's skyline has made me jealous for years . 
  rotterdam 's skyline is pretty great , but it needs a bunch of 180m + buildings like warsaw to build the feeling of density like warsaw 's cluster has . 
  the hague has the density and unique architecture , but not enough towers and none of them are taller than 150m . 
  sigh . 
  the troubles of a skyscraperlover in nimby land . 
   so your response to me pointing out that there are actually quite a lot of migrants from these countries , contrary to what you said , is ` so what ' ? 
  great argument mate . 
  it 's to point out that just because * you * think it 's a bad thing , does n't mean you 've established that as fact . 
  you 're starting from the unsubstantiated assumption that immigration is a bad thing , and then to support that all you do is show examples of immigration . 
  that 's circular reasoning . 
  `` so what '' is the only response one can give to such reasoning ; as in `` so what exactly is the problem ? '', 
   immigration rates are way to high to ever be sustainable . 
  we 're getting around the population of liverpool immigrating here each year . 
  another unsubstantiated claim . 
  they are by no means unsustainable , even if the numbers continue as is ( which they most certainly wo n't ) . 
  it 's of course also rather disingenous to imply you 're adding a city the size of liverpool to your country every year ( because you 're ignoring emigration ) . 
  you 're not . 
  in 2015 , the * net immigration * to the uk was 330,000 . 
  liverpool has a population of 466,000 within its city limits ( almost double that in its urban area ) . 
  that 's 70 % of liverpool you 're getting , or a difference of 136,000 , which does n't quite allow for one to say `` eh , it 's around the same . '', 
  however , even if you said that you 're adding 70 % of liverpool every year , you 'd still be wrong , because 2015 ( and 2014 ) was a record ( and exceptional ) year . 
  in 2013 , the rate was only 209,000 . 
  taking a snapshot of migration over time at its highest point , and using that as as the baseline , is disingenuous . 
  the one on the top right actually looks pretty damn cool . 
  the bottom ones both look pretty generic , though the left one is obviously far superior to the bottom right one . 
   four years ago the estimate for poland was 600,000 immigrants . 
  so , it will be more now . 
  conjecture . 
  even if true ... so what ? 
   this is for a country with less than 40m population . 
  again , so what ? 
   it 's safe to guess that if poland had germany 's population than it would be almost two million by now . 
  but it does n't . 
   130,000 lithuanians , from a country of just under three million citizens . 
  so , about one twentieth of lithuania have moved to britain . 
  just look at this graph , these people are n't just vanishing into mid air you know . 
  again , so what ? 
  i 'm sure that if you start off from the assumption that foreigners are bad ... then this all seems very important and dire . 
  but i 'm not seeing anything here that 's actually objectively a problem for the uk . 
   this only expired two years ago , and there have been no estimates of population since after then , so the numbers could be very much higher indeed . 
  again , so what ? 
   a lot of the migrants already speak english , which is my reasoning as to why they 'd want to move to britain . 
  if that 's your reasoning for thinking that you 'll be faced with millions of the present refugees as immigrants in a few years time , then you 're being ridiculous . 
  once they become settled in a rich country , they 're going to need a little more than that to just up and move en masse , especially given that mastery of the local language is often ( and increasingly so ) a requirement for citizenship in the first place . 
  you do n't see mass migrations unless the political or economic situation in a country is so bad as to neccesitate it . 
   it 's evident that there are plenty of migrants thinking this way , hence the jungle camp in calais . 
  it 's evident that only tiny minority of them think that way , since the number of refugees in calais does n't even represent 0.3 % of the total number that 's supposed to have entered europe in 2015 . 
  if you want to hold calais up as some sort of example of what britain can expect in the future ... then worry not , since you 'll have absolutely nothing to worry about whatsoever . 
  except they were n't wrong at all . 
  you * were n't * suddenly flooded with millions of east europeans . 
  combining all of the foreign-born people in the uk from east europe [ does n't even reach 1 million people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign-born_population_of_the_united_kingdom ) , let alone multiple millions . 
  and it took years for that number to reach to its current point ; so it was hardly ` suddenly ' . 
  and of course , there 's the fact that this immigration , contrary to what certain may think , has not had any particularly negative effect on the uk . 
  britons may think they 're so special that all the immigrants will immediately go to the uk the first chance they get ; but that has n't been true in the past and wo n't be true in the future . 
  the uk does not have the highest share of immigration in europe ; either from other european states or from non-european states . 
  this is not true today , it has not been true in the past , and it will not be true in the future either . 
  even if we 'd have millions of current immigrants getting citizenship in 5 years or whatever the term may be ... and even if they suddenly all decided to move to other european countries when they do ... you would receive only a minority of them , not even enough to break a million assuming a worst case scenario . 
  but of course that 's not going to happen because the example you provided is completely and utterly different from the situation today .
