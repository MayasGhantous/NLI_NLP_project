  i 'm pretty sure i could actually understand that . 
  calling the netherlands holland is like calling denmark hovedstaden . 
  i 'm confused . 
  why the fuck do most countries not have any subdivisions shown , but russia and finland do ? 
  ( also the uk and maybe denmark ? ), 
   we view russia as an actual threat and take an extremely dim view of giving any ground to temporarily appease some other power , it 's almost always a shortsighted decision that leaves you worse off in the long run . 
  if only . 
  the us has historically done just that rather a * lot * ; with the predicatibly bad results that come with it . 
  now , maybe the us has learned from that since ... but that seems doubtful . 
  the us is a pragmatic country , not a principled one . 
  it will give ground in order to appease others when it feels its in its best interests . 
   we 're much more used to military conflict and less averse to it when we think it 's necessary . 
  that has it 's pros and cons , as has been illustrated in the past few decades . 
  if only . 
  americans are much more used to military conflict where they get to watch their bombs explode on tv without seeing the carnage those bombs cause . 
  americans are used to wars fought against minor players , with little in the way of american casualties . 
  the american public is not prepared to deal with a war in which american soldiers are going to die en masse ( much less a war that might reach american shores ) . 
  they may think they are ; but the past ( ie ; vietnam ) , suggests they are n't . 
  modern europeans are averse to military conflict because we decided that being * used to * war was a really fucking terrible thing when it destroyed our continent twice in less than half a century . 
  it is n't just sharing of tanks though . 
  the 11th airmobile brigade of the dutch army has been integrated into the german rapid forces division ; whereas the german marines are being integrated into the royal dutch marine corp ; with the germans sharing the use of the karel doorman ( the largest ship in the dutch navy , used for sealift/seabasing/support operations ) in that context , it does seem more like the germans are freeloading ( getting an airmobile brigade , and a ship they can use , while we only get a few tanks ) . 
  of course , i 'm sure they 'll be paying their share of maintenance and what not . 
  unless they think holland is n't just a province * in * the netherlands , and actually a country somewhere else altogether . 
  which let 's be honest , is totally a thing they might think . 
  uhm ... one of those nuclear power plants is literally at the top of the european list for nuclear power plants ranked by the population density of the area they 're in . 
  the doel plant is located in the port of antwerp , the largest city in belgium ( 2nd largest if counting metro ) and has more than 9 million people living within less than 50 miles . 
  the other one is only a few miles from liege , also one of the largest cities in belgium . 
  so no , belgium did n't build theirs in areas that are n't that populated . 
  they do n't build actual castles though . 
  they 're just making holes , and then prop the sand up on the sides to make the hole seem even deeper . 
  it 's like the german has a deep-seated need to to go to the dutch beach , but does n't want to be around dutch people . 
  in the past , they embarked on a scientific endeavour to solve this conundrum by annexation , in the hope that one day , all the dutch people would be german thereby avoiding the problem . 
  this experiment ( henceforth known as the great beach experiment ) failed , so now they just dig holes so they do n't have to look at us . 
  the dutch people , on the other hand , are confused and frightened by this behavior because during the great beach experiment , the germans also dug holes on our beach , but then put mines in them so as to deter the british and americans from ruining the experiment , as they tend to do . 
  so the dutch are constantly weary of these german beach holes . 
  no seriously , what 's with the holes ? 
  it 's ... freaking weird . 
  germans are like , the only people on the planet that do it . 
  as a dutchman , i can say with absolute certainty that it 's not how we imagine germans . 
  the dutch image of germans is basically [ this ] ( http://denhaagfm.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/duitse-kuil-in-het-strand.jpg ) . 
  seriously , what is it with you guys and digging holes on our beaches ? 
  are you under the impression that european countries do n't have that too ? 
  it happened with the uss donald cook , an arleigh burke-class destroyer . 
  the last battleship in the world was the uss missouri of the iowa class . 
  it was launched in 1944 , retired in 1955 , then recommissioned in 1986 and finally retired from active service in 1992 . 
  the uss donald cook displaces between between 6-8 ,900 tonnes depending on load . 
  the missouri by comparison , displaced 45,000 tonnes . 
  a wholly different beast . 
  it 's almost the size of an aircraft carrier . 
  there 's a rather big difference between nato having a ship pass more than a hundred kilometers from a russian owned shoreline in an area where nato shorelines are much larger than the russian one ... ... and russia having a military jet pass so close to a ship that it could very easily be mistaken for an attack , or otherwise be a threat if the pilot makes a minor mistake and crashes into the ship . 
  there is sending a message , and then there 's taking ridiculously stupid risks . 
  both of these actions send messages . 
  one says ; `` we 're keeping an eye on you while keeping a respectful distance . '', 
  the other says : `` we 're unprofessional idiots who are okay with stumbling our way into a war because flybys look cool . '', 
  the 15000 + mbt number includes all of the stuff they have in mothballs . 
  this also goes for the afv 's , although adding those all up does n't yield more than 30k . 
  most of these reserves are severely outdated , and whether or not most of it is even serviceable is a very * big * if . 
  and that 's assuming they even have the money needed to take that stuff out of mothballs to put into service , which they do n't . 
  adding the reserves certainly yields big numbers that sound very scary ; but there 's not a whole lot of cause to be scared of a reserve force that largely consists of rusting first generation t-72 's and bmp-1 's . 
  europe actually * does * have more firepower in active service . 
  7,695 mbt 's versus 2,562 ; 18,819 afv 's versus 3,229 ; 9,817 artillery units versus 5,739 . 
  the eu 's airforce is also slightly larger ; and much more modern . 
  the combined eu navy is also much larger ( and again , much more modern ) than that of russia . 
  russia 's military equipment generally is n't very modern , and quite inferior to what european countries have in stock . 
  the maintenance level of a lot of their equipment is also highly questionable . 
  that is n't to say that a war would be * easy * ; but europe absolutely has the advantage , numbers and tech wise . 
  it 's how they became the largest country in the world , after all . 
  mumblemumble something about ungrateful baltics mumblemumble, 
  it really goes to show how completely out of touch the russians are . 
  anyone who knows what they 're talking about might disagree . 
  there 's a number of areas in which european military technologies are more advanced than that of anyone else at ( yes , including the us ) . 
  the thing though is that the us has a unified defense apparatus that can take full advantage of any technological edge it has in an area , and is sizeable enough to pick up the slack where it does n't . 
  whereas the eu 's military forces are fragmented , meaning you can for instance have a navy with the best radar systems around while not having the weapons to take full advantage of that fact . 
  training wise , it 'll be about on par with us forces ; though armchair experts looove to argue about the subject ( though they only ever seem to look at special forces , which is kind of an unfair comparison anyhow ) certainly that aside , european militaries have superior technology and training , compared to * most of the planet * . 
  and the scientific/industrial base to build on if we did decide to get more serious about it ; which i think was his point . 
  they did not . 
  the government simply reinterpreted the constitution to allow for the use of military force to defend its allies . 
  this reinterpretation is highly controversial and does n't involve the changing of any laws . 
  there 's plenty of areas in the netherlands where you 'd probably feel you 've entered the countryside . 
  it 's just , those areas are n't the places you 're likely to visit as a tourist ( or for that matter , as a non-tourist ) . 
  surely these places qualify as countryside : [ somewhere in groningen ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/search/map/@53.3955215,6.5783317,3a,75y,173.17h,86.07t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1spsgorzrxqpmu3crnnd1-yg!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dpsgorzrxqpmu3crnnd1-yg%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d267.80212%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656 ) [ somewhere in friesland ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/search/map/@53.1217474,5.6477744,3a,75y,252.72h,85.25t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1srpzf8k9ekevxrjox5fpbba!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo2.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3drpzf8k9ekevxrjox5fpbba%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d323.42719%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656 ) [ somewhere in drenthe ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/search/map/@52.7828175,6.6264574,3a,75y,21.54h,86.21t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sozcemxqsf6kyaikxzbpzrq!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dozcemxqsf6kyaikxzbpzrq%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d302.55014%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656 ) [ somewhere in flevoland ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/search/map/@52.4531344,5.6006061,3a,75y,15.07h,86.68t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sev5p_fevlny7cp5idgej7q!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dev5p_fevlny7cp5idgej7q%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d271.5%26pitch%3d-3!7i13312!8i6656 ) [ somewhere in zeeland ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/limagrain+nederland+b.v./@51.3139675,4.1567686,3a,75y,200.15h,91.11t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sqo_swzdpac4fb_ujcaovga!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dqo_swzdpac4fb_ujcaovga%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d143.74083%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c47053f14b8347:0x3d916141228561c2!6m1!1e1 ) [ somewhere in limburg ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/search/map/@51.1112458,5.9277029,3a,75y,65.69h,90.12t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sbhxdgnarefuedyldxjch5q!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo3.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dbhxdgnarefuedyldxjch5q%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d168.23239%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656 ) just some random spots picked in the more rural areas . 
  everyone knows light pollution is an indication of sophistication !, 
  nope . 
  just pointing out it can get even worse . 
  that 's not even anywhere near the worst light pollution in europe . 
  it 's too bad so many of you do n't seem to want the help . 
  why not ? 
   is it ? 
  yes . 
  encouraging a mob mentality response against people ( in this case their own ) , is irresponsible . 
  why is that even a question ? 
  legal or not ; it 's the kind of thing that could easily lead to 5th column purges . 
  which , given the climate already being what it is ... is extraordinarily irresponsible on the part of the turkish government . 
  what the fuck are they thinking ? 
   but the us is world 's second largest manufacturer , and < 1 % of our population is in prison . 
  so , no . 
  the netherlands is the world 's 2nd largest exporter of agricultural products in the world , but only 2 % of our population is employed in agriculture . 
  not saying that the entire american manufacturing economy is tied to prison labor ( which strikes me as highly unlikely ) ; but the prison population being a small percentage of the total population does n't really say much in that regard . 
  incidentally , if you count people on parole/probation , then the percentage increases to 2.8 % . 
  ... those are n't forgotten in the projections .
