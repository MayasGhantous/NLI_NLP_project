  austria was * not * a part of the german nation until 1945 . 
  they were a part of the hre and the german confederation ; but neither of these could realistically be called the ` german nation ' , they were not countries but loose associations thereof . 
  austria was forced to leave the confederation in 1866 , and had nothing to do with germany until after ww1 , when it briefly attempted to become part of the german republic , but the treaty of saint-germain put a stop to that ; forbidding any union between germany and austria . 
  even if you define ` german nation ' to mean , ` anyone considering themselves ethnically german ' , it still would n't be up until 1945 , as the austrians already began to identify themselves as explicitly separate from germans in the post ww1 era , a trend exacerbated by the experiences of ww2 . 
  there 's quite a bit of difference actually , especially in the written form ; but there 's also grammatical differences between the two ( different plural forms ) , vowel shifts , and loss/replacement of various words . 
  however , there 's still enough similarities that the two can understand each other to a fair degree . 
  that said , it 's often difficult with languages within the same language family ( like germanic ) to determine where exactly the dividing line is . 
  the areas marked 4 and 5 probably should n't be counted as german dialects . 
  dutch low saxon is considered to be a dutch dialect by many linguists ; not a german one ; as it 's been heavily influenced by dutch instead of german for centuries . 
  some of the regional varieties of dutch low saxon are n't even considered low saxon by many linguists , but rather low franconian . 
  it 's their own goddamn fault for naming it rhode ** island ** when said island is only about half as big as texel and represents only 3 % of the state 's land . 
  yeah , i think i 'm just going to stop talking to you ; since for someone keen on accusing others of having zero expertise/talking out of their ass , you certainly do n't seem to know much of what you 're talking about . 
  yes , we have plenty of expertise with these kinds of floods as well , thank you very much . 
  good day . 
   the total amount of dikes and dams of the german coastline and all the rivers dwarf the dutch numbers by a fair bit . 
  first , you 're going to have to provide a source for that . 
  it was practically impossible to find a figure for the length of the dutch system , and it 's proven utterly impossible to find anything for that of germany . 
  second , germany is much bigger ; there is absolutely no way that the amount of flood protection per square km in germany approaches anywhere near the level found in the netherlands . 
  third , german dikes are of inferior quality . 
  their river dikes are only designed to deal with a runoff of 14.600 m3/s ; ours are designed to deal with a flow of 16.000 m3/s at lobith ( the point where the rhine enters the netherlands . 
  the flow will actually increase beyond that ) ; with a safety margin of 2000 m3/s . 
   the differences in water levels are much more extreme than what happens downriver . 
  what you seem to fail to understand is that the total amount of water does n't matter , what matters is how high those high levels go . 
  you can not possibly state such a thing with this level of confidence . 
  the height the water will reach is obviously largely determined by the * amount of fucking water flowing through the river * . 
  there 's a reason dutch dikes are much higher than german ones . 
   those have been recognized as outdated models since they give the river not enough space , so for the past decades those have been modified to accommodate more water . 
  you do realize that we are the ones that decided these were `` outdated '' models right ? 
  we were giving more space for rivers long before germany started doing it . 
  of course , it 's not that they 're `` outdated '' so much as that adding more space for rivers to flow in * combination * with the existing system of dikes provides a better level of protection . 
   also , the whole ` americans are ignorant ' thing is such transparently trite bullshit to make yourself have a false sense of superiority , when europeans can name very few states in the middle of the map of the united states . 
  i do n't want to give the impression i 'm agreeing with his arguments , but i think you may be underestimating europeans here . 
  most people will at least know the names . 
  yeah , most of 'em will have difficulty pointing some of them out on the map ... but that 's largely because like two thirds of them are just practically identical squares . 
  these are indistinct shapes , in contrast to the much more unique/diverse shapes of european countries . 
   why are croatians so ignorant of geography ? 
  there are tens of millions more people in those states than in many europeans states , and economies magnitudes upon magnitudes larger . 
  i 'm sorry but ... you kind of just destroyed your own argument . 
  you ca n't complain about someone else 's knowledge of geography while simultaneously ** utterly failing your own country 's geography ** . 
  tens of millions more people in those us states than in many european states ? 
  taken as a whole , sure , individually ? 
  not possible . 
  there 's only 9 us states that have a population that even break the 10 million mark ( compared to 16 european countries ) and only 3 that breaks the 20 million mark ( compared to 9 european countries ) . 
  the claim their economies are magnitudes upon magnitudes larger is also absurd . 
  sure , that 's true for california compared to say montenegro , but when you compare the lists as a whole you find there is n't really a whole lot of difference . 
  eastern/southern europe still drags behind the west/north , but the latter are pretty much on par when you compare between states of similar population ( european countries may actually do somewhat better here , for instance , florida has a noticeably larger population than the netherlands , but pretty much the same gdp ) . 
   by your reasoning , much of the united states is much more important than croatia . 
  sure , by that reasoning croatia would fit right between kentucky and oregon ; two states nobody in the world cares or knows much about other than one is the home of delicious chicken and the other has something to do with an ancient computer game americans keep droning on about . 
  gdp wise it would rank between idaho and rhode island . 
  two states nobody in the world cares or knows much about other than one must be the ancestral home of a famous ghola , and that the other is famous for `` wait , it is n't part of canada ? '', 
   they must be stupid and ignorant said no american ever . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
   and talking about right and wrong in international relations utterly misses the point . 
  we were talking about importance . 
  excuse me , but international law ( which is , you know , a cornerstone of international relations ) , is kind of * all about right and wrong * . 
  something you would think a croat especially ought to be aware of . 
   i realize , the concept of a larger hill must be hard to grasp for you , but just recognize that water going down a steep hill will gain speed and will pool at any obstacle . 
  those obstacles in this instance are called villages . 
  your problem is that you 've given up . 
  you say its impossible . 
  it 's not . 
   sigh . 
  you really do n't get it , do you ? 
  where exactly do propose should those dams be build ? 
  you have water running down the hills , little streams all of a sudden carry massive amounts of water , cities that are n't even next to rivers get flooded - because the water can not be drained fast enough . 
  a dam in this case would do the exact opposite of what you are thinking - it would prevent the flood from reaching the river . 
  dikes and dams are two different things . 
  the dikes would , like in the netherlands , be built * alongside * the rivers . 
  ideally , as in the netherlands , you have a system of two dikes . 
  one directly along the river bank , and a higher one further inland . 
  in most cases , the lower one will be sufficient to deal with raised waterlevels . 
  it can be deliberately pierced in order to flood the area behind the first dike , thereby taking pressure off the rest of the system and preventing catastrophic dike collapse . 
  a system like this , if properly engineered , would be just as effective in dealing with riverflooding in the areas you speak of . 
  depending on the lay of the land , particular areas might require some additional engineering ; such as creating flood canals in various areas where secondary dikes can not be built . 
  but it 's perfectly feasible . 
  the difference is simply that your culture , and most others , are not willing to do what it takes to deal with the problem . 
  you assume its impossible , or decide that its too expensive . 
   it was actually germany that started to enlarge flooding areas and move dams further inland . 
  seeing as you seem to think dams and dikes are the same thing : the netherlands has done this for centuries . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/rivierbedding.gif ) is what a dutch river looks like . 
   you continue to confuse flood protection against the sea with flood protection against rivers . 
  i suggest you read up on the difference . 
  you continue to ignore the fact that the biggest flood threat in the netherlands is not from the sea , but from rivers . 
  29 % of the country is subject to river flooding ( while only 26 % of the country is below sealevel ) . 
  the total combined length of our dikes is 17691 kilometers . 
  the length of our coastline is 523 kilometers . 
  you do the math . 
   you fail to understand that floodings in the mountainous areas can not be prevented . 
  you fail to understand that they can be prevented . 
  it 's a matter of engineering . 
  in fact , many of the defenses that the netherlands employs would be useful in these areas ; because as i pointed out ( a point you seem to have ignored ) , we 've experienced the same kind of flooding ; yes , we too suffer from flash floods where a large amount of water threathens to overwhelm the system . 
  again , it is a matter of engineering . 
  dikes/levees are n't things that can only be constructed in the netherlands ; these can be constructed along rivers everywhere , and would most * certainly * help in containing flash flooding . 
  smart use of them in combination with things like canals , can reduce most of the risk . 
   even more so since there is just the ocean downriver , so you do n't even have to care what you dams might do to the next country . 
  again , you do n't seem to understand that we experience the same problem . 
  even though you really * should * since you mention us being downriver . 
  what do you think happens when there 's heavy rainfall in germany or france ? 
  that water all comes to us and joins the hundreds/thousands of feeder rivers , greatly amplifying the amount of water we have to deal with in comparison to those places upstream , which in turn puts an extreme amount of pressure on our system of dikes . 
  the waterpressure our system has to deal with is exponantially greater than what similar systems would have to deal with upstream .
