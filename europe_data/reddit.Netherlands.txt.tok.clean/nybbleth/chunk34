   having a delta is plus because the water can spread out that way . 
  really ? 
  are you not aware of the blatantly obvious fact that delta systems are created by flooding in the first place ? 
  river deltas are the most flood-prone types of areas in the world . 
  to add to that , these regions are also , almost without expection , * sinking * ; greatly increasing flood risk in the process . 
  while it is ( on a simplistic level ) true that a delta allows the water to spread out , thereby decreasing pressure ... that does n't really help when the amount of water the delta has to deal with is ** orders of magnitude ** greater than upstream areas . 
   flood protections have been done all over europe for centuries , the netherlands are in no way unique in this regard . 
  which only goes to show you do n't really know what you 're talking about . 
  like i pointed out , the total cost of our defenses runs into the * trillions * of euros . 
  most other countries do n't even get into the billions . 
  and while you talk about doing it for centuries , we 've been doing it for at * least * 2500 years . 
  among the oldest democratic institutions in the world are the dutch water boards , that date back almost 900 years and whose task has been seen as so important that their authority to set laws and carry out punishments ** exceeded ** that of the ruling nobility as they related to the safety of flood protections ; another thing that i 'm fairly certain is unique to dutch history . 
  other countries may experience floods , but our entire history and culture has evolved around them . 
  i. . . do n't think you understand how physics or geography work . 
  water flows * downhill * . 
  rivers erode a path through mountains and hills , meaning that their route already tends to be the lowest area along their path . 
  the main risk is rivers experiencing flash floods , which can be pretty damaging where they occur but are rather localized . 
  slower floods can also occur in larger riversystems due to heavy rainfall upstream , but these are the same type of floods that can and have happened in the past in the netherlands ( which , being a delta-land , experiences a vastly greater quantity of waterflow when there 's flooding happening upstream ) so what you 're saying does n't apply to these type of floods . 
  the netherlands being flat has contributed to a much larger volume of flooding in the past than more mountainous areas experience . 
  there is n't even a question about that . 
  preventing flooding in the netherlands is only possible because of 1000 + years of flood defenses being built upon each other . 
  if we were to build these defenses from scratch today , the cost has been estimated to run into the trillions of euros . 
  so unless these mountainous areas have spent an equivalent or greater amount of money ( hint : they have n't come even close ) , you really ca n't claim that its harder for the mountainous areas . 
   most people could n't even point these places out on a map or tell you the significance of them and they 're barely on any country 's radar when it comes to dealing with russia . 
  that should tell you how much of a difference they make in european politics . 
  psst , most people ca n't point out croatia on a map either , or tell you the significance of it . 
  so is this * really * an argument you want to be making ? 
  how many people can point to a place on the map or how much attention politicians give to it has nothing to do with the fact that what 's being done to them is plain * wrong * ; and it does n't mean we 're justified in just turning a blind eye . 
  it 's not an entirely non-existent thing . 
  `` americanisation '' is a term i hear every now and then ; but that 's usually in relation to specific things . 
  it 's generally stuff like for example a political party might want to arm the police to a greater degree , then the opposition will point out what that could lead to and that we should n't want to be like america in that regard . 
  it generally is n't `` halp !, 
  our culture ! '', 
  related . 
  ocassionally you 'll hear people bitch about all the english slang that makes its way into how young people talk . 
  but i feel like not only is that not anywhere near as common as it was in the past , it 's also not really any different from the complaints people always have about slang , regardless of what language the slang originated in . 
  that 's not the proper definition though . 
  being an expat has nothing to do with how long you intend to stay . 
  the word is a shortened form of ` expatriate ' , which means to remove yourself from residence/allegiance of your birth country . 
  in that sense , you could differentiate between an expat and an immigrant by saying the expat made a concious decision to renounce his country in exchange for another ; whereas the immigrant simply moved to another country . 
  it 's only relatively recently that the term has started being applied to people who are given work in another country by a large company , which is obviously more temporary . 
  but i do n't think that use of the term is really correct . 
  it 's always easiest to blame the audience for a show 's lack of success . 
  that show you helped made bombed ? 
  it was n't anything to do with the show , it was totally awesome , it was just that people were too stupid/racist/backward / whatever to really * get it * . 
  he 's full of it . 
  maybe what he 's describing is actually true in croatia ( i doubt it ) , but it 's really not true for most of europe . 
  obviously we 're going to be more aware of what 's going on in the us than in say , zimbabwe ; but people being more aware of american politics than their own local politics ? 
  and i say that as someone who does n't watch my country 's television , read my country 's newspapers , or pay any real attention to my country 's politics . 
  the internet makes people part of a global culture ; and because of the fact that english is the language of choice to communicate with between different nationalities and because americans make up a large portion of the internet , * of course * that global culture is going to be colored more by the american perspective than the croatian perspective . 
  but reactionary sentiments make people overestimate the effect this has on their own culture . 
  i do suppose the effect is going to be bigger or smaller depending on the ` presence ' of one 's own language/culture on the internet . 
  dutch is the twelfth biggest language on the internet ; accounting for 1,3 % of the top 10,1 million websites . 
  quite impressive given that it represents only something like 0,33 % of the real world and its rank is somewhere in the 50 's . 
  croatian meanwhile represents less than 0,1 % of the top 10 million sites . 
  granted , its a much smaller language to begin with , but even accounting for that its underperforming in comparison . 
  0,1 % might not be enough to foster a croatian internet culture ; causing croatians to flock to english language sites in larger numbers than dutch , french , germans , etc , do . 
  that in turn can make it seem as if local culture is being swallowed up . 
  the copy & paste aspect of some dutch developments is certainly hit and miss ; but even at its worst , there 's a structure and order to it generally lacking across the border . 
  dutch rules are more strict about how buildings have to fit into their surroundings . 
  while that does sometimes make things more difficult , it also means we do n't really get the eyesore monstrosities you sometimes find in belgium . 
  incidentally , the copy & paste type of housing development is losing popularity here . 
  there 's a lot more variety and room for individual buyers ' design choices in many [ new projects ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.3545836,5.1517667,3a,75y,59.74h,90.63t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1se2ca8sa4oiul43j3jy5aya!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  not sure it necessarily works , but eh . 
  shit . 
  they figured out we have a timemachine !, 
  quick , erase the past !, 
  why would you think that 's even a concern ? 
  most nato members do n't . 
  only five countries ( including mine ) participate in the nuclear weapons sharing program ; and we do so voluntarily ; it is n't something we * have * to do . 
  you probably would n't even be able to convince the us to include sweden in the program if you were full-fledged nato members . 
  which ... fits the definition of that word pretty well ? 
  thanks for proving my point !, 
  there 's absolutely no objective basis for this idea that the eu `` holds a mild disdain for democracy when it goes against what the eu wants . 
  '' ; yet it gets thrown around by some people whenever it 's the eu that does n't do something * they * want . 
  which really is n't any different from the relationship of these people to national governments , which often get accused of disdaining democracy just as much or even more so . 
  certainly there 's been the idea of a ` democratic deficit ' in the eu ; but that idea has been around for a long time and people do n't seem to realize that the eu has reformed its institutions enough so that the term does n't really apply anymore . 
  not to mention , the same people who oppose the eu while claiming its because the eu is n't appropriately democratic , tend to be the same people who opposed pro-democratic reforms in the eu in the past ( and who could n't be bothered to properly research what it was they were voting against ) . 
  yes , the eu is a democratic institution . 
  the european parliament , whose members we vote into office , functions effectively the same as the united states house of representatives . 
  it holds the legislative power in the eu ; meaning that any laws it passes or rejects are passed or rejected with a * democratic mandate from the people * . 
  do n't like what laws they pass ? 
  then vote for people who wo n't pass them !, 
  upset that voter turnout is as low as it is ? 
  first , get off your ass and start voting . 
  second , realize that voter turnout for eu parliament is actually about roughly the same as voter turnout for us presidential elections . 
  and accountability ? 
  what makes you think the eu is n't accountable ? 
  its various governing bodies are either directly elected by the european people , or indirectly by virtue of the fact we elect the national parliaments that appoint them . 
  the eu also publically broadcasts the meetings and sessions of the council of ministers and the european parliament . 
  and the meetings of the european commission are subject to monitoring by independent bodies that report to the european parliament ; ensuring transparancy and accountability . 
  but surely , if you care about democracy , you know all this . 
  the san francisco-amsterdam comparison is also an interesting comparison because of the regions they 're in . 
  the san francisco bay area ( consisting of san francisco , san jose , oakland , and various other cities ) is somewhat similar to the randstad ( consisting of amsterdam , the hague , rotterdam , utrecht , and various other cities cities ) . 
  both regions have almost the same population , and geographically both are roughly ring-shaped ; the bay area circling the bay ( obviously ) ; while the randstad circles the green heart . 
  the randstad is much more densely populated though . 
  more so in situations where one side is the status quo , and the other side is in opposition to it . 
  any pro-eu campaign is mostly going to boil down to either : 1 ) look at all the good things the eu has done !, 
  or 2 ) look at all the bad shit that 'll happen if you leave . 
  1 is going to be met with mockery given that the basic argument from the opposition is eu = bad .
