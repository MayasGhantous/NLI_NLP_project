  by controlling where the water goes ( made possible by the extreme level of flood defenses we 've had for centuries ) , we could control the movement of enemy armies , halting their advance or forcing them to take particular paths ( which were of course heavily fortified kill-zones ) . 
  it 's how , for instance , in 1672 , when we got simultaneously invaded by france , england , and the german states of cologne and munster , we managed to not just defend ourselves , but actually win a favorable peace , despite having neglected spending on our army for years . 
  if not for the waterline , the french would have destroyed our forces entirely in their initial invasion . 
  let 's see . 
  the netherlands : * population : 17 million . 
  * gdp : $ 856.265 billion * birthplace of the franks , who would go on to create an empire that laid the foundation of medieval europe and everything that followed . 
  * became its own empire that ruled much of the world . 
  * first capitalist country in history . 
  * first modern republic in history . 
  * jumpstarted the scientific revolution . 
  * gateway to europe with ports that dwarf anything in the us . 
  * 2nd largest agricultural exporter in the world . 
  * fifth largest exporter in the world , period . 
  * home to three internationally recognized world cities . 
  * home to the international capital of justice . 
  missouri : * population : 6 million . 
  * gdp : $ 284,462 billion . 
  * birthplace of : no empire , much less two . 
  * first nothing in history ( ? ), 
  * known for : st.louis . 
  mississippi : * population : 3 million * gdp : $ 98 billion . 
  * birthplace of : people from mississippi . 
  * incapable of protecting itself from floods . 
  * known for : having a name nobody knows how to spell . 
  yeah ... i \u00b4 m pretty sure that \u00b4 s * not * why they get confused . 
  americans . 
  seriously , i 've heard * lots * of americans confuse the netherlands and denmark because they ca n't remember the difference between danish and dutch . 
  i find myself more annoyed by : `` you 're dutch ? 
  i love copenhagen ! '', 
  the populations of some of these states suffer the most from aids . 
  having a meeting on ending aids without these states present is , frankly , impossible . 
  while their position on this matter is reprehensible , you ca n't move forward without them . 
   it 's not a strawman , it 's the counter point to the other posters point . 
  it 's not . 
  his argument was literally `` do n't glorify the past you guys , it was made possible through bad shit ! '', 
  what do you do ? 
  you respond by saying `` well you know that 's the way the world works ! '' . 
  okay that may be true , but when you do n't qualify that statement even slightly , replying to the original statement with it automatically becomes an argument against the statement that we should n't glorify the past . 
  then , when i naturally take issue with the statement ( because you did n't qualify it ) ; you start talking about how bad stuff happening in the past is n't an excuse to blame people for the actions of their ancestors . 
  despite your personal feelings on the matter , * that * ** is ** a strawman argument , because ** nobody ** was saying that it was . 
  by arguing against a position nobody holds , you 've set up a ` strawman ' . 
   i 'm just talking about what i see as a beginning of blaming the uk for its history but not other countries . 
  right . 
  because nobody 's ever blamed other countries for the shit they pulled in the past . 
  the uk is the real victim here !, 
  everybody else gets a free pass !, 
  that 's a strawman . 
  people are telling you that there 's a problem with glorifying the past . 
  that is * not * the same thing as blaming you personally for it . 
  that said ; when you * do * glorify the past and lay claim to it , you must also lay claim to the bad things . 
  you do n't get to just pick the good parts . 
  serious answer ? 
  the word ` dutch ' is derived from the old dutch word dietsc , which like the old high german diutsch is derived from the proto-germanic theudo . 
  the word basically means something like `` the people/the nation '' . 
  the old dutch shifted to becoming diets , the german became deutsch . 
  english , being a germanic language , also had a version of the word . 
  they initially used their version of `` dutch '' to refer to all people of germanic descent on the mainland ; but because it was the people from the netherlands they had by far the most contact with , `` dutch '' became synonymous with people from the netherlands . 
  diets is no longer used in the dutch language , while the germans still refer to themselves as deutsch . 
  this is why people get confused , but it makes perfect sense if you know the history . 
  i do n't think they will necessarily be seen as immigrants forever ; but you 're right that its a problem . 
  the problem really is that the people born here are often stuck between cultures ; they 're of course strongly influenced by their parent 's culture , which ( especially when combined with ethnicity ) , marks them as ` other ' . 
  they feel rejected by the country they 're born into ( a sentiment amplified by political/media focus on them as opposed to other minority groups ) , and so naturally they will seek for an identity that feels like its their own . 
  this makes them easy prey for extremist/conservative views of islam/their ancestral culture , while the parents are often seen by the children as betraying their heritage/true faith . 
  this radicalization of course only fuels the cycle . 
  this is common enough to color public perception , but it really depends on the individual . 
  a turk who dresses like a westerner , and talks like a westerner , will generally be seen and treated the same as a westerner . 
  naturally this is controversial , because people feel like they should n't have to give up their culture and ` sanitize ' their image to fit in . 
  which is a fair point ; but then it 's also unfair to expect people to include others into the national `` in-group '' when they do n't make the effort to fit in . 
  similar things happened with other minority groups , that are now more and more accepted and seen as part of the national identity . 
  it does n't * have * to be the case that immigrants and their descendents are always seen as ` other ' instead of as part of the same nationality as those whose ancestors were here a thousand years ago . 
  as time passes , both groups move towards each other without becoming a bland uniform whole . 
  of course , with those other groups , religion did n't really play a large role , so its difficult to say if the same pattern will hold . 
  it might go slower this time around , but i think eventually it 'll end up alright . 
  we just have to make it through to the other end . 
  which is n't an excuse that can be used to justify its glorification . 
  it depends on where people are from . 
  heineken is most popular in the west , and north . 
  at least when looking at distribution to cafes and the like . 
  presumably that implies its more popular there than elsewhere . 
  there 's also the fact that heineken simply has the best brand recognition . 
  if you do n't know what beer you want , just that you want beer , ` heineken ' is what comes to mind for most people . 
  and then there 's brand loyalty to consider as well . 
  personally i prefer grolsch on the rare occasion that i drink beer . 
  why would i play down the uk if i was scared of them leaving ? 
  especially knowing it annoys british nationalists like yourself ? 
  you 'd think i 'd be trying to get you to stay by appealing to your ego . 
  why do n't you try addressing the arguments instead of trying to convince yourself that europe 's the one that ca n't live without you , instead of the other way around ? 
   are you denying the euro has been a disaster for economic growth ? 
  yes . 
  of course i am . 
  because it has n't been . 
  i know it 's the popular thing to claim it 's been a disaster , but it really has n't been . 
  aside from the fact that to call it a ` disaster ' is hilarious hyperbole , the euro has n't been a bad thing . 
  far from it . 
   remember what happened to the greeks ? 
  yes . 
  they lied about their government finances ; hiding their massively unsustainable debt . 
  oh i 'm sorry , did you want to blame that on the euro ? 
  nope , not happening . 
  the euro did n't cause greece 's problems .
