  it does n't . 
   that 's a matter of opinion no , it 's not . 
  it 's a basic objective fact , and i ca n't believe this is even up for debate . 
  you can not seriously be claiming that trying to excise a population group that is ** part of the public in the first place ** , for no reason other than their ancestry , is in the public interest . 
  it 's not . 
  period . 
  even if we were to agree that they 're all bad ( and we obviously do n't ) , it 'd no more be in the public interest than it would be in the interest of your health to excise a tiny tumor by setting yourself on fire . 
   when it 's illegal to speak how do you know what people want ? 
  it 's not illegal to speak . 
  it 's illegal to discriminate based on ethnicity . 
   no , importing millions of violent people from a backwards culture then going out of your way to cover-up crime oh for fucks sake . 
  first of all , we 're not talking about `` millions '' of violent people . 
  only a minority of the people in question are violent . 
  and secondly , we 're not even talking about `` imported '' people anymore . 
  these people were ** born here ** . 
  how many fucking times do i have to explain this to people . 
   a piece of paper says that they 're dutch , but nothing about their culture or behavior does . 
  i wonder how many of the people that you 're defending would even consider themselves `` dutch '' . 
  they 're dutch by birth . 
  they 're dutch by * law * . 
  it 's not just a `` piece of paper '' that says they 're dutch ; it 's the * foundation of our society * that says they are . 
  if you 're willing to subvert or set aside the basis of our society to get rid of people who do n't act ` dutch enough ' for your tastes , then it 's you who should get the fuck out of this country , because you 're the bigger threat . 
  and it does n't even matter whether they consider themselves dutch or not ( though i expect far more of them do than you think ) ; it 's a free country . 
  so long as they follow the same laws as the rest of us ( which most of them do ) , they can consider themselves dutch . 
  martian . 
  whatever . 
  it does n't fucking matter . 
   that 's what confused me . 
  this seems like politically charged persecution . 
  instead of making something up like dictators do in 3rd world countries the current people in charge just took what he really said and made it a huge deal , blew way out of proportion . 
  if you believe this then you clearly know nothing of dutch politics or dutch law . 
  despite what wilders will insist , this is * not * political persecution , and the `` people in charge '' have absolutely nothing to do with it . 
  in fact , if ` the people in charge ' could , they would make this trial go away because they know that this trial does nothing but provide wilders with more ammunition to whip up support . 
   the people supported him , hence the chanting . 
  so if an opposing politician can not express a view that represents the public interest in public then what is even the point of democracy ? 
  `` the people ? 
  '' ; his supporters may be people , but they are not * the * people . 
  they do not represent a majority . 
  and he is not representing the public interest . 
  not only is his viewpoint not shared by the majority of the public ; but his rhetoric is actively promoting the division of our society . 
  that is the opposite of representing the public interest . 
   no doubt every single person who said they want less migration or deportation of bad migrants was deemed some sort of extremist ... you apparently did not read a thing i said . 
  so i will repeat myself one more time . 
  if all he had said he wants less migration , or even deportation of `` bad migrants '' , then he would not be in trouble . 
  there 'd be a lot of us disagreeing with him , but he can totally say those things if he wants . 
  ` that 's not why he 's in trouble . 
  he 's in trouble because what he said was aimed at * everyone * of a particular ethnic background . 
  ** even the ones who were born in this country ** . 
  even the ones who have done nothing wrong . 
  i repeat : ** these are not migrants we 're talking about , but dutch citizens ** . 
  it 's discrimination of the sort that is forbidden by the constitution and common fucking decency . 
  you can not deport people just because they belong to a specific ethnicity . 
  that is insane . 
  ridiculous . 
  and flat-out illegal . 
  and it would be all of those things even if these people were n't born here ; which many of them * are * . 
  i 'm sorry , i knew pvv voters were n't known for being the most educated people ; but this is ridiculous . 
  you do know numbers work , right ? 
  the 2e kamer has a 150 seats . 
  at its highest , the pvv was polled at 42 seats ( they 're currently polling at around 28 ) . 
  42 is less than 76 . 
  so is 28 , by the way . 
  i did n't want to assume that to be obvious to you . 
  76 is the number of seats they 'd need to represent the majority of the voters . 
  incidentally , the voters are only a percentage of the dutch population ; so even if they represented the majority of the voters ( which they do n't ) , they would n't necessarily represent the majority of the dutch people . 
  now ... ... do you mind explaining to me exactly how i 'm wrong and the polls show we * do * all want to kick people out just because they 're moroccan . 
  and i told you , even if the most optimistic polls turned out to be accurate , pvv voters would still represent only a minority . 
  or are you seriously telling me you 're under the obviously delusional belief there 's polls out there that predict the pvv will get at least 76 seats ? 
  being the biggest party in polls does n't mean they represent the majority of voters . 
  we 're not a two party country . 
   the dutch do dot owe foreign migrants anything , if the dutch decide that they do not want to let them in then that 's how it should be . 
  most of the people he was talking about are n't foreign immigrants . 
  they were born in the netherlands and have dutch passports . 
  and yes , singling out a specific ethnicity to be deported is most certainly what one would call both hateful and racist . 
  he would n't be in legal trouble if he had said he wants less immigration . 
   ( and probably most dutch and non-muslim foreigners ) wilders fans keep insisting on this ; conveniently forgetting that even if the most optimistic polls turned out to be true ; pvv voters would still represent only a * minority * of the dutch populace . 
  all the evidence suggests most of us do not want to throw people out just because they 're morrocan . 
  in fact , anyone who thinks the majority of the public is in favor of that obviously has a tenuous grasp on reality at best . 
   well , i 've never worn such kind of t shirt so i ca n't confirm that , yet i can confirm i 've been threatened because of smaller things by aforementioned groups in your mentioned capitals . 
   as an example : i 've learned my lesson that i should n't say anything anymore or look at all when someone breaks open the doors to the underground railway for free , and i should just keep looking down the floor instead . 
  by * groups * do you mean , the sort of people who commit public vandalism to get on the train for free ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that the sort of people who do that are indeed the sort of people who will not give you a pleasant experience if you say something about it ... ** but i 'm also sure that they 'll do that regardless of what * other * groups they belong ... ** you 're talking about teenage and adolescent thugs . 
  but you 're trying to make it be about something else . 
  thank you for that brilliantly argued assertion . 
  of course i knew about it . 
  their military being in severe disrepair is the entire reason they even * have * such an ambitious modernization program . 
  but it does n't matter how ambitious the program is if they ca n't afford it . 
  i do n't think he 's the one in this thread who ` se being naive ... 
   this is nonsense . 
  it 's not ; as should be obvious to anyone to genuinely knows what they 're talking about . 
  intervening in the middle-east is easy . 
  something they can do even with their largely obsolete equipment . 
  that does n't mean they 're capable of attacking the west . 
  their military modernization program is ambitious , but far too expensive for what they can afford . 
  something that the putin administration itself has even been forced to publically acknowledge russia being able to overrrun the baltic states does not prove your point . 
  the russians could do that even if all they had was sticks and stones . 
  it 's been well known for a very long time that the baltics are indefensible unless we station massive troop numbers there ; which runs counter to nato 's strategy of deterrence . 
  we purposefully place only a token multinational force there . 
  russia could take the baltics . 
  it ca n't keep them .
