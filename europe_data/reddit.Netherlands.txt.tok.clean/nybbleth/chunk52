  and in contrast to popular misconception , edison did * not * invent the lightbulb . 
  there 's at least 22 people who ` invented ' it before edison did . 
  humphry davy was the first to create an incandescent light ; a full 76 years before edison 's bulb ; and his work formed the basis of everything that followed . 
   well why are we leaving out these regions ? 
  because we were n't talking about them . 
  and because we 're talking about muslims . 
  central africa is n't islamic ( with the exception of chad , which has only a slight majority of muslims ) . 
  so why even bring it up ? 
  islam is the largest religion in west africa overall , sure ; but there 's plenty of west-african countries where this is not the case . 
  besides , in terms of the fertility rate ; these regions are outliers . 
  there 's a number of factors involved in explaining the high fertility rates here , and islam is n't really one of them . 
  furthermore , these factors disappear once migration to the developed world happens ; leading to a steady drop in the rate over the generations . 
   oh sure , just have a look at birth rates in syria and act as if every migrant was syrian and you can keep walking around blindfolded by yourself . 
  there 's a reason why people focus on syria ; because the vast majority of people seeking asylum are in fact from syria and the middle east . 
  the only western african country in the top 10 for asylum applications is nigeria , occupying the 8th place . 
  there were only something like 30,000 applications from nigeria in 2015 . 
  versus more than 350,000 from syria . 
  just to put things into perspective . 
  of course people are coming in from sub-saharan africa too . 
  but so what ? 
  they represent a minority of the migration stream ; and contrary to what the alt-right 's panic is telling you , the fertility rates just are n't as huge a deal as you 're making it out to be . 
  i 'm * really not * wrong . 
  you 're suddenly bringing in central and west africa , when nobody ever mentioned these places . 
  when you made your statement that people should n't be having 10 children , you were responding to a poster that was explicitly talking about the middle east and north africa . 
  you were wrong ; and when called out on it , you 're suddenly shifting attention to an entirely different part of the world that has nothing to do with what anything that 's been said . 
  naturally , even at the highest outlying figures for sub-saharan africa , no country has a fertility rate of 10 ; and the average rate of either central africa or west africa is just above 5 ( and dropping , just less quickly than other regions ) , so it really does n't matter that you 're shifting the goal post because your glib comment still is n't accurate . 
  and they 're not . 
  the average fertility rate for north-africa and the middle east is 2.7 maybe people should stop throwing stereotypes around that are 60 years out of date when talking about these issues . 
  just a thought, 
   you 're the one pushing a narrative . 
  yeah . 
  it 's called objective truth and keeping some perspective . 
   the birth rate of muslims is the highest in the world . 
  and i never disputed that ( at least , if we 're looking at impossibly broad categories like religion ) . 
  but it does n't really matter . 
  not only is the global birth rate of muslims not particularly high ( even being the highest as it is ) , it 's also dropping . 
  and it is significantly lower in the developed world ; and it just so happens this whole thread is about muslims * in * the developed world . 
   but it is however 1,5 times as high as native birthrate , which is in the same numbers of pew . 
  1,5 times is n't really a lot . 
  not really a problem , even if we were to agree that muslim growth = inherently bad . 
   also , as you can see in the graph , the more prosperous the country , the higher the birthrate difference . 
  you did n't link a graph . 
  you linked a table . 
  but ignoring that ; no , that 's not what it shows . 
  the numbers are all over the place . 
  * some * high developed countries have a higher difference compared to less developed countries . 
  others ( rather relevantly , germany ) , do n't really . 
  you might also note that the countries with the lowest difference just so happen to be the ones with long established muslim minorities ; which rather effectively demonstrates that over time the differences between groups get eliminated ( something which the projections of course , also demonstrate ) . 
   so my point was still pretty much on point , no matter how you interpreted it . 
  no , it is n't . 
  you 're comparing between developed european countries ; not between european countries and muslim majority countries . 
  the table you linked actually demonstrates that your original point is * anything * but on point , because in actual reality the fertility rate of european muslims differs significantly from that of the global rate of muslims . 
  you 're right . 
  dishonesty and/or blatant ignorance in people triggers me . 
  you were n't just asking a question ; you were trying to push a narrative . 
  after all , your question had * already * been made redundant by the posted facts regarding the fertility rate . 
  your question does n't make sense in that context , except as a poor attempt to push your narrative . 
   have a look at this and tell me what you think . 
  i think you do n't understand how human procreation works if you 're still insisting that a fertility rate of 2 leads to exponential growth . 
   there is an increase from 43 million to 70 million ( and i do n't believe this takes into account immigration ) first ; all you had to do was look at the * source * of the data found there to discover that yes , it * does * in fact take into account immigration . 
  secondly ; the population growth of europe 's muslims * as a whole * is 2.2 , which is slightly * above * replacement level and therefore you can still have long-term growth . 
  if the rate was 2.0 instead , and there would be zero immigration , then we 'd see zero population growth over longer periods of time ( though you can have short-term growth , this is n't sustainable as others have explained to you ) ; in contrast to your profoundly incomprehensible claim that said rate would instead yield exponential growth . 
  also , nothing in those projections seems to justify the fear you and others are projecting about the issue . 
   worldwide , the muslim population has the highest birth rate . 
  not by a whole lot . 
  the global average for muslims is a fertility rate of 3.1 but this is n't vastly different from the global christian average , which is 2.7 ; or the global average period , which is 2.5  why do you expect that to be different in a prosperous country ? 
  because it * is * . 
  i 'm sorry to burst your little alt-right bubble , but the fertility rate of muslims in europe is lower than it is in the muslim world itself . 
  2.2 in europe ; which is barely above replacement level ( which is 2.1 ) . 
  that is a * fact * . 
   do you know how reproduction works ? 
  if you have 2 or 3 kids , and those kids have 2 or 3 kids ... til that humans reproduce like amoeba do . 
   i am not fear mongering , i am pointing something out !, 
  pointing something out that simply is n't true , presenting a false image that is scarier than the actual reality . 
  for the record , if people consistently have 2 kids , what you end up with after 50 years is n't a population figure that is exponentially higher than what you started with , but the ** exact same population figure ** . 
  ( lower actually , since you need a little extra just to cope with non-natural losses ) you need a fertility rate of 2.1 ** just to maintain the population ** . 
  the average fertility rate of immigrants in germany is only 1.95 btw ; higher than that of the native population ; but still below replacement rate . 
  in fact , throughout europe , the fertility rates of immigrants ( including muslims ) is pretty close to that of the natives ; and is generally falling toward native levels . 
  so yes . 
  you * are * fear mongering . 
  then there 's still cities lower than amsterdam . 
  almere for instance . 
  or hoofddorp ; both of which have substantially more inhabitants than 25,000 . 
  ( not so ) fun fact : the original batavia hosted the deadliest mutiny in history.before it was shipwrecked , there was a planned mutiny that never fully got off the ground . 
  after the shipwrecking , the captain and a number of others tried to find fresh water and food , but when they failed to do so , abandoned the survivors and headed for batavia ( the city ) . 
  meanwhile , the would be mutineers were left behind took over . 
  first thing they did was send some of the soldiers to one of the nearby islands in search of water ; but this was actually a ruse to get rid of them since the mutineers did n't think the soldiers would find anything and intended to leave them there to die . 
  then once the soldiers were gone , they started murdering other survivors . 
  first to get rid of those they feared would resist them ... then to reduce the numbers so as to stretch supplies . 
  the guy in charge even had plans to use the gold and silver from the ship to set up his own kingdom . 
  they ended up brutally murdering at least 110 people . 
  including children . 
  ironically , the soldiers they 'd sent to the other island to die * did * find water and food . 
  eventually , they found out about the murders , at which point they built a makeshift fort and weapons . 
  the mutineers learned about the water , and tried to attack the soldiers and their fort a number of times but failing because the soldiers were much in a much better condition due to their access to water and food . 
  then along comes a rescue force from batavia ( the city ) right as the soldiers prevail against a siege of their fort ; and together they manage to round up all the mutineers . 
  of the 341 people that started the journey , only 68 survived . 
  there really should be a proper blockbuster movie about the story . 
  incidentally ; and i just thought of this and had to share it ; but jacob 's loyalty mission in mass effect 2 seems heavily inspired by the batavia ( yeah i 'm probably a little too antsy for andromeda ) . 
  theoretically .
