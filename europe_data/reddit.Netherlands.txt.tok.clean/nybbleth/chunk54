  during the 17th century , holland was already industrialised ( not using coal/steam though ) ; and though the dutch republic had a sprawling colonial trade empire , the vast majority of its trade profits actually came from europe ( which was true for all of the colonial empires really ) . 
  so clearly , colonial wealth was n't really required to have industrialization . 
  if we 're looking at the industrial revolution proper though ; this happened to coincide with growth in the new world ; resulting in a larger export market for industries . 
  it 's kind of a chicken and egg situation : industry creates more goods , which fosters economic growth , which increases demand for more goods and thus more industry . 
  there 's others factors involved as well . 
  industrialization in either the dutch proto-industrial revolution , or the later ` proper ' british industrial revolution was only made possible by agricultural revolutions in both these countries , for instance . 
  increasing crop yields meant that food production required fewer people to work in the fields , who could subsequently work in factories instead . 
  i see you 're not familiar with the actual facts . 
  so let 's take a look at srebrenica for instance . 
  why did it fall ? 
  it was certainly not because of the dutch troops ; which the us has been all too eager to lay the blame on . 
  no , today we know it is because of a secret agreement that the united states , the uk and france made to suspend all air strikes against the serbs . 
  an agreement they * neglected * to tell their allies about . 
  an agreement they * still * neglected to tell us about even while our forces on the ground made repeated and frantic requests for air support because they were being surrounded . 
  we were not even allowed by the people in charge to use our own jets to support our troops . 
  and if you think that this is going to be the exception to prove the rule ; you 're naieve . 
  ** our forces were knowingly set up by the americans to fail and take the blame . 
  it 's something we will * not * forget . 
  ** america is * not * a reliable ally . 
   just as all nato members are bound by treaty to do their fair share ( % 2 military spending ) maybe the problem is that americans apparently do n't understand what a treaty is ; because there 's no treaty that obligates nato members to spend 2 % of gdp on their military . 
  it is has always been a guideline/target ; not a treaty requirement . 
  the us is a profoundly unreliable ally , as my own country learned in srebrenica . 
  plus , who could seriously claim the us is a reliable partner with trump at the helm ? 
   ceded in an act that was entirely administrative without even the consideration that the ussr might break up . 
  ir-fucking-relevant . 
   the people locally idenitfy as russian . 
  irrelevant . 
   they tried to hold an independence referendum in the 90s . 
  not true . 
  they held a vote to become an autonous region ** within ** ukraine ; which must be understood in the context of ussr that was falling apart . 
  a majority of crimeans supported ukrainian independence in the ussr referendum a few months later , knowing full well this would mean crimea would stay part of ukraine . 
  besides , crimeans consistently polled as opposed to independence prior to the sham-referendum the russians organized . 
   ultimately it is in my oppinion the people of crimea that have a claim to crimea your opinion is irrelevant . 
   if russia has no claim to crimea than what claim does ukraine have ? 
  the fact that it was formally ceded to them . 
  nothing else matters . 
  russia 's history with crimea does not matter . 
  it does not matter if russia now goes all `` well we did n't think we 'd ever split up so you got to give us back the ring you bitch ! '' . 
  ukraine is the only one with legal and moral claim . 
  it 's called a puppet state . 
  what the fuck kind of madness is that line of logic ? 
  they were n't somehow benevolent for allowing the unification of a country that was n't theirs to begin with . 
  the ussr had no rightful claim to east germany . 
  and russia has no rightful claim to crimea . 
  you are a crazy person . 
  i should not have bothered to clarify what is ** blatantly obvious ** to anyone with the slightest shred of historical awareness or common sense . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's the language of dictatorships . 
   he ca n't do any real lasting damage without a majority . 
  even if he never managed to accomplish anything other than ending up pm ; that by itself would do significant damage that 'll last well beyond his rule . 
  we do n't live in a vacuum . 
  putting our own trump into power , a raging xenophobe and narcissist , will ruin our standing among nations . 
  that 'll be their own damn fault then . 
  it 's not like they 'd be able to reasonably claim they did n't know that nobody wants to work with their guy or that the pvv 's ambitions are completely unconstitutional and impossible to implement . 
  democracy does n't mean we automatically have to cooperate with someone ; who would destroy our country in a heartbeat if he ever got to do half the shit he wants to do ; just because he got some votes . 
   for example we know that two of three dutch army brigades are integrated , but how much is that in terms of personnel , both total and relative to the armies ? 
  the 11th airmobile brigade consists of 4.500 troops and is integrated into the division schnelle kr\u00e4fte ( dsk ) . 
  the 43rd mechanised brigade consists of around 3.000 troops and is currently being integrated into the 1st panzerdivision . 
  that leaves the 13th light brigade , which also has around 3.000 troops . 
  as well as the korps commandotroepen ( kct ) ; as well as various command/support groups , including incidentally , the i. german/dutch corps , which is a joint military hq consisting of 4-500 personnel and which has been around for more than 20 years and is probably the main reason why this integration is even happening in the first place . 
  the other way around , germany 's marines ( seebatallion , 800 marines ) are integrated into the dutch marine corp ( 2300 marines sans the german ones ) . 
  aside from that , the entire belgian navy is integrated into the dutch navy . 
   is not because we did n't need the land ( we did ) no , we did n't need the markermeer . 
  the zuiderzeewerken were designed to deal with the food shortages that were projected to occur as a result of population growth . 
  however , by the time the flevopolder was completed , technological advances had resulted in food surpluses that negated the need for more land . 
  the markerwaard was postponed in the 80 's because it was no longer necessary and its economic value had become dubious . 
  only later , in the debates that followed , were ecological and waterlevel concerns raised , and it was eventually decided to simply not go through with it . 
  which is a horribly inaccurate movie btw . 
  so ... ... we could demand to finally be told what 's under those kilts ? 
  hold hands against head , assume a fetal position , and repeat after me : jesus fucking christ what is happening to the world , jesus fucking christ what is happening to the world , jesus fucking christ what is happening to the world , jesus fucking christ what is happening to the world , jesus fucking christ what is happening to the world , jesus fucking christ what is happening to the world , jesus fucking christ what is happening to the world . 
   all modern warships look like that do they ? 
  yes . 
  anything launched after 2000 look pretty much like [ this ] ( http://www.rd.nl/image/policy:1.503675:1467330188/2015-10-20-bin1-raketproef-zeven-provincien-4-fc-web.jpg?f=16x9&amp;$p$f=427ed58 ) or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horizon-class_frigate#/media/file:forbin-090531-n-9988f-406.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/fs_surcouf.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.navyrecognition.com/images/stories/west_europe/netherlands/patrollers/holland/holland_class_opv_royal_dutch_navy_dsns_damen_top.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/hms_daring-1.jpg/1920px-hms_daring-1.jpg ) , or [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/ins_kolkata_entering_mombasa%2c_kenya.jpg ) tell me ( without looking at the image name ) which of those are specifically classed as stealth ships and which are n't just by looking at them . 
  this is what pretty much any ship design launched after 2000 looks like regardless of whether they are fully stealth or not . 
  there 's a few more recent designs like the zumwalt that differ in appearance , but even with those you can clearly see the same basic features ( just taken to extremes ) . 
  that wiki literally states that the type 45 is a fully stealth ship ; which given your own criteria , is pretty damn obvious . 
  but a stealth ship is n't * necessarily * built using special material . 
  stealth is about the total package , special materials might not always be deemed cost-effective ; and a design can potentially still be considered stealth without it . 
  as for right angles , i do n't know of a single modern frigate or destroyer that does n't incorporate that in its design . 
  show me a navy that 's rolling out frigates/destroyers that do n't follow that paradigm , and you 're showing me the equivalent of an airforce rolling out new biplanes at the start of ww2 . 
   they certainly try to reduce cross section , but they are not stealth . 
  right angles + special materials is something that is done * precisely in order * to reduce cross section . 
  you can not declare that stealth involves right angles/special material , and then declare that trying to reduce cross section is n't stealth . 
  you can argue about how much a ship has to commit to the design in order to classify as stealth , but without having access to classified details on the cross section of the various ships , any such dividing line is bound to be entirely arbitrary and subjective . 
  * full actual * stealth additionally incorporates sound-reduction ; both in actual sound and in electronic noise . 
  as well as heat reduction . 
  not all ships fully commit to doing all of that ( though some effort will almost surely always be made ) , but at that point you 're just arguing semantics : as detection methods become more advanced , the bar for ` stealth ' is raised higher and higher . 
  today 's stealth is tomorrow 's ` not-stealth ' . 
  uhm . 
  almost all modern destroyers and frigates are stealth destroyers . 
  they * are * the average warship . 
  it 's not really that unprecedented . 
  in fact , it happens all the time around the world , for a variety of reasons . 
  well if we 're going by everything we ever had : netherlands : east-frisia , kleve , new york , new jersey , delaware , connecticut , rhode island , maine , nova scotia , guyana , suriname , french guyana , brazil , south africa , mauritania , senegal , ghana , luanda , mauritius , sri lanka , taiwan , indonesia , southern india , bengal , suratte , malacca , too many islands in the carribean to name , too many forts and tradeposts elsewhere to name . 
  luxembourg : none ; although if we 're allowed to take all the stuff the duchy of luxembourg held throughout its existence , we would also get hungary and the holy roman empire . 
  so you know , there 's that . 
  ... for a moment i thought you had randomly put an anime reference in there . 
  it 's a good thing i googled that phrase so that i 'd know it 's your national motto , thereby preventing my outing as an anime nerd . 
  highly improbable . 
  last i checked , the nypd did not have jet fighters , mobile artillery , or naval destroyers .
