  shit , i got excited for a moment , then realized you were being sarcastic . 
  accepting this guy into the position sets a dangerous precedent and risks normalizing his views . 
  you would n't accept an intermediary in business deals that is openly hostile to your business but not the other either . 
  you would n't agree to go a marriage counselor if the counselor is on public record stating that he wants to destroy your marriage and run off with your wife . 
  why the fuck should this be any different ? 
  that would be sending entirely the wrong message . 
  it would be giving the impression of weakness and acceptance , and that will have unforeseen consequences . 
  we need to make * very * clear that this sort of thing is just * not * acceptable . 
  we 're not some impoverished central-american country the us can get run over in their humvee if they do n't do what the us wants . 
  we 're the european motherfucking union . 
  they do n't dictate terms . 
  we do . 
  that 's the only kind of language trump and his kind understand . 
  not as far as i know ; but my google-fu has not yielded me a reliable list of people declared persona non-grata in the eu so i do n't know . 
  i did discover that apprently trump was declared persona non grata in panama in 2011 ( for what else , making stupid remarks ) . 
  so there 's that . 
  yeah , if they just accept this guy instead of declaring him persona non-grata i 'm going to be extremely dissappointed . 
  william i of orange . 
  also known as william the silent . 
  ringleader of the dutch revolt , and stadtholder of a number of dutch provinces at the time . 
  nope . 
  the fort 's construction was ordered in 1580 . 
  the act of abjuration that formally declared our independence was signed in 1581 ; which is often regarded as the birth of the dutch republic , but some would argue we did n't become a republic until 1588 when it was declared that sovereignty did not lay with a monarch . 
  not ordered by a king though !, 
   debatable if a ceasefire should not be called peace . 
  no , it 's not debateable . 
  they are two different things . 
  the 12 year truce that was signed , was explicitly designed to expire after 12 years . 
   japan is still at war with russia because of ww2 ( if i recall correctly ) no . 
  it 's not . 
  the two never signed a peace treaty due to various circumstances ( mainly the kuril islands ) , but the joint declaration of 1956 formally ended the war . 
  not peace . 
   what would you say if we just overtake this 80 % ? 
  i would say you 're living in a fantasy . 
  it 's a nice idea ; and more trade with mexico is of course welcome , but there 's a * reason * they trade that much with the us : they 're right fucking next door . 
  it is not realistic to think we could overtake the us in terms of mexico 's trade volume . 
   we remove putin from the list of enemies no . 
  appeasement will only embolden putin and the russians . 
  not acceptable . 
  should he be selected , perhaps you could write a letter to eu officials with more information/details on the dishonesty you 've personally witnessed ? 
  i doubt they 'd do anything with the information directly ( especially since they probably would n't be able to verify it if you 're doing anonymously ) ; but it might help . 
  uhm . 
  what ? 
  no monumental late 19th century architecture in amsterdam ? 
  have you even * been * to amsterdam ? 
  [ 1885 ] ( http://static.thousandwonders.net/rijksmuseum.original.8970.jpg ) [ 1888 ] ( http://develop.amsterdamnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/concertgebouw.jpg ) [ 1889 ] ( http://www.shopgids.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/centraal2.jpg ) [ 1899 ] ( https://erfgoedstem.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/voormalig_hoofdpostkantoor_n.z.voorburgwal_amsterdam.jpg ) to name a few of the most prominent ones . 
  it 's a real shame the [ paleis voor volksvlijt , 1864 ] ( http://vandaagindegeschiedenis.nl/wp-content/uploads-pvandag1/2013/04/paleis-voor-volksvlijt-560.jpg ) burned down though . 
  yes , people can be declared persona non grata by the eu . 
  diplomatic immunity is n't particularly relevant afaik . 
  the eu has declared a number of people persona non grata in the past ( including the president of ivory coast ) . 
  individual eu states have also declared ambassadors persona non grata in the past ( syrian ambassadors for instance ) . 
   is n't that what fascism is about ? 
  no ; it 's just a symptom . 
  fascism is authoritarian , populist , and radically ultranationalist . 
  fascism coats itself in conservative rhetoric about the decline of society/the nation and preach about the purging/cleansing of those elements they 've declared to be contributing to the perceived decline . 
  they also views themselves as a `` third way '' ; neither left nor right . 
  radically anti-liberal , and also ending up anti-conservative . 
  they end up in opposition to all other views ; viewing themselves and only themselves as the path to national salvation . 
  they tolerate no dissent . 
  no opposition . 
  because they `` know '' what 's best for everyone else . 
  that 's why they end up running totalitarian states . 
   professor ted malloch said he would `` short the euro '' jesus fucking christ . 
  appointing to the position of ambassador to the eu a guy who is publically hostile to the eu like that is what passes for political ability now ? 
  what the fuck is happening to america ? 
  and what the hell are we going to do about it ? 
  it is only a matter of time , finland . 
  it 'd just put a slightly less crazy but potentially more evil member of his flunkies in power . 
  no , if we 're going that route , what we need is some designated survivor type shit . 
  dutch people from the 17th century would look at this and think `` why is there so few windmills ? 
  what happened to our industry ? '', 
  there used to be vast numbers of them in the country , there 's really only a handful left nowadays . 
  you 're either trolling , or delusional . 
  but just because scandinavian countries have a higher gdp per capita or nice passports , does n't mean that a nordic union would be an economic superpower . 
  it would be on part with the benelux ; which while important , is unfortunately not an economic superpower either . 
  that 's why we have in-air refuelling options . 
   i am just pointing out that the raf and french air force ( i think we can agree are two of the more capable air forces in europe ) could not mount operations over a distance of under 2000 km . 
  this simply is n't true ; despite how american media may have painted it . 
  they could and * did * mount those operations . 
  they did not * need * us assistance ; but of course * having * us assistance is preferable to not having it . 
  there were some shortfalls here and there ; which pointed out problems ; but hardly at a level where we could n't conduct operations like this at all without the us . 
  incidentally , the eu spent at least three times as much money as the us did on the libyan campaign . 
   west bengal , which was at 1,028 / km2 , though my home town of calcutta has about 24,000 / km2 my own province has a population density of only 285/km2 ; although the city i live in has a density of 1,515 / km2 . 
  the densest city in the country ( the hague ) has only 6,240 / km2 . 
   i 'd love to visit the netherlands someday , probably to itc enschede where we have loads of research collab !, 
  enschede is n't really a particularly interesting city though . 
  as far as most people are concerned , it 's probably best known for the fireworks disaster in 2000 . 
  no need . 
  it 's an honest mistake . 
  what state ? 
  our own provinces of south and north holland are somewhere in between bihar and lakshadweep in density . 
   that sounds absurdly low !, 
  what ? 
  it 's a higher population density than india , which is only at 390km2 . 
  the issue is muddied by the fact that the lower figure for the netherlands is for a territory that includes all of the internal surface water ; which thanks to us damming an entire sea as well as substantial areas elsewhere , represents something like 20 % of the total , which is a much , much higher figure than it is for most other countries ( excluding some tiny island-chain nations that include all the water between the islands ) . 
  the uk by comparison has only 0.67 % internal surface water ( i 'm not sure what the figure is for england itself , but it wo n't be massive bigger or smaller i 'm guessing ) . 
  the cbs , which is the dutch government agency responsible for gathering statistics on everything , often uses the 504 figure . 
  my figures are directly from [ cbs statline ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=70072ned&amp;d1=56&amp;d2=0%2c7%2c101%2c136%2c190%2c216%2c276%2c390%2c490%2c494%2c531%2c688%2c754%2c777&amp;d3=a&amp;hdr=t%2cg2&amp;stb=g1&amp;vw=t ) they probably do exclude internal surface water ; which is really the only sensible way to do it given that we have so much more of it than other countries . 
  it 's also not true . 
   the population density of england is actually higher than that of belgium and the netherlands no , it 's not .
