  and that 's only when you include their reserves ; which mostly consists of the bmp-1 . 
  which was introduced in 1966 ; and which is so good at its job that russian/soviet soldiers took to riding it * on the outside * , because * every * rpg fired at it would penetrate the armor , set everything on fire , and subsequently the entire vehicle would explode . 
   how many tanks does eu have ? 
  around 8000 in active service . 
  but this is not incredibly relevant when you consider the fact that 80 % of russia 's tanks are obsolete pieces of metal rusting away in storage . 
  the bulk of their tank forces would get chewed up by eu tank defenses and gunships . 
  my god , t55 's still represent a sizeable portion of their reserves . 
  * they were introduced in ww2 * . 
   air forces ? 
  we have more attack craft than them . 
  and the eu 's fighter fleet is generally more modern and better maintained . 
  no , they really would n't win quickly . 
  at all . 
  they have less than a 100k military personnel in europe ( which wo n't all be combat capable troops . 
  it includes support personnel ) . 
  certainly , if they could magically keep their plans a complete secret , and managed to use these troops to coordinate a surprise attack , they would do serious damage . 
  but the combined active forces of the eu exceed 1.8 million ; more than the total of the us . 
  the forces the us has in europe would be annihilated unless the us committed the full extent of its military straight away . 
  a conventional war in europe would be a nightmare ; and would under absolutely no plausible circumstances be over quickly . 
  it would take years . 
  and a nuclear war would just be suicide for anyone that starts it . 
   it 's simply closer to the bulk of the german market and manufacturers no . 
  that 's only part of it . 
  rotterdam is a * global * port . 
  while shipping to and from germany through rotterdam makes a lot of sense ; it also makes a lot of sense to use rotterdam to ship to and from * europe * ( it is n't known as the gateway to europe without just cause ) . 
  it has the very best shipping infrastructure ; meaning that if you want to ship something from china to anywhere in europe , it makes perfect sense to drop the bulk cargo off in rotterdam , before individual bits get sent to sweden , france , the uk , or wherever . 
  rotterdam is also one of only two ports in the entire world capable of handling the very largest and heaviest of ships when they 're fully loaded . 
  oil is also a massive contributor to rotterdam 's success ; it is home to royal dutch shell , as well as one of the largest petrochemical complexes in the world . 
  plus , it is home to much of the world 's strategic oil reserves . 
  rotterdam is to global oil reserves what new york is for gold . 
  many countries keep their strategic reserves in rotterdam . 
   no puppet , no puppet . 
  you 're the puppet . 
  no , you 're the puppet i keep expecting timetravellers to pop up to try and assassinate him . 
  to be fair , everything 's instantly more awesome when there 's an alpaca in the room . 
  you 're obviously trolling . 
  but just in case you are n't , or just in case someone takes you seriously : hamburg 's port is small compared to rotterdam ( not surprising , given that rotterdam was the largest port in the world for over almost half a century before the rise of chinese ports ) . 
  rotterdam is the largest in europe by every cargo metric . 
  in terms of container units , hamburg is * relatively * close , though still not in the same class ; rotterdam handles millions more in teu 's . 
  in terms of total cargo tonnage though , hamburg is tiny compared to rotterdam , which handles ** more than three times ** as much cargo as hamburg does . 
  even antwerp , europe 's second largest port , does not even handle half of what rotterdam does . 
  geographically , rotterdam is in the optimal position in europe , much more so than hamburg . 
  rotterdam 's port is also physically bigger ; it covers 105 square kilometers versus hamburg 's 74 . 
  rotterdam is also the most automated port in the world ; again by far ; enabling it to handle larger volumes of cargo more efficiently than its competitors . 
  i 'm not calling for war . 
  i 'm just stating that attempts by a foreign power to break up the eu could indeed be construed as an act of war . 
  i considered writing a serious response ; but then i took a look at your posting history and decided ` why fucking bother ? ', 
  i 've heard the name , is it in top 5 of the biggest cities in the netherlands ? 
  like after amsterdam , hague , utrecht and groningen ? 
  ... rotterdam is the 2nd largest city in the netherlands , and the largest port ( by far ) in the western world . 
   btw , the plans for stockholm i do n't know . 
  something about this seems fishy . 
  frankly , if they were to actually do this ; part of me thinks we should just outright consider it an act of war . 
   yep , the stockholm region has 346/m2 and that is ** almost all ** a city . 
  ehm ...  to be fair , ** more than half ** of stockholm county looks like this or this kind of confusing me there . 
   we are not looking to project forces around the globe we are , actually ; because the eu has territory and defense obligations around the world . 
  we already have blue water capabilities in the navies of some eu countries . 
  not only would we need to maintain this , it would make no sense to not expand on it ; even if we do n't go for a carrier-based navy . 
   sweden has some very nice submarines , which can sink us aircraft carries . 
  swedish subs are hardly the only ones capable of that . 
  dutch submarines have sunk us carriers in exercises on at least * two * separate occasions . 
   that would give the eu 200 submarines , 3x more compared to the us . 
  this is a ridiculous number . 
  besides , why only go for one type of submarine ? 
  europe has lots of fantastic different subs ; with different capabilities . 
   small boats equipped with cruise missles are more effective than destroyers . 
  this is also ridiculous . 
  they 're not . 
  destroyers form the core of any competent navy ; and bring far more capabilities to the table than just missiles . 
   let 's buy 1.000 . 
  let 's not . 
  that 's a ridiculous number ; and that money would be far better spent on acquiring a * range * of different ship types . 
   drones are important . 
  an attack drone is 15m eur . 
  let 's double that for control equipment . 
  . . maybe buy 3.000 ? 
  the us has 800 , so that 's ok . again , what 's with these ridiculous numbers ? 
  besides , you do realize that you ca n't just buy all of these different things and be done with it , right ? 
  you need to factor in everything from acquiring and training personnel , to ammunition , to maintenance and neccessary infrastructure . 
  you can not afford to buy ships , and subs , and drones and what not in these kind of numbers and actually expect to be able to use and maintain them . 
   russia has around 10.000 tanks . 
  most of which are vastly obsolete , but okay . 
   we do n't need tanks because that offensive this is another ridiculous comment . 
  * every * kind of weaponsystem is offensive . 
  we need tanks . 
   let 's buy 13.000 mowag piranha . 
  you want to buy 13.000 lightly armored apcs to counter 10.000 tanks ? 
  how the fuck do you think that 's going to go ? 
  i 'll tell you how it 'd go : poorly . 
  i think rotterdam could be a bit more dense . 
  it 's too spread out right now , so it does n't look as good from every angle . 
  though when the [ angle ] ( https://s14.postimg.org/k78ss7bht/img_8905.jpg ) * is * good , it looks [ really ] ( https://s27.postimg.org/knam4s9xv/rotterdamskyline.jpg ) good . 
  of course , other dutch skylines are n't as great as rotterdam or the hague . 
  amsterdam has three different clusters , none of which are particularly good on their own , and utrecht needs more highrises + density . 
  then you 've got cities like eindhoven , tilburg , and almere , which have small ok-ish skylines , but which definitely are n't that impressive . 
  with his hands though , he 'll only ever be able to play the world 's smallest fiddle . 
   yep , the stockholm region has 346/m2 and that is almost all a city . 
  meanwhile , south-holland has a population density of 1300km2 , and half of it looks like [ this ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/dir///@51.9728709,4.4112347,3a,60y,242.97h,87.48t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1skks7xoye5n_d3w-5n8g4rw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ), 
  which must seem like a megacity to someone from sweden . 
  the randstad is * also * relatively empty though .
