  we 'll just sell the remains as `` pre-cooked pig meat '' . 
  if it 's too charred , we 'll sell it as premium charcoal or some such . 
  we 're dutch ... we can sell anything . 
   also , i checked the internet and it told me that klap was bang , blow , hit or strike . 
  a punch is also these things !, 
   then it 's better to say that a certain % of the population votes x or y , instead of requiring a total turnout . 
  that 's ... effectively the same thing . 
  stop analyzing this . 
  neither of us will ever get to pretend we 're one-punch man if not for punching flies dead with one blow . 
  actually , never mind . 
  i forgot flies are seemingly immortal . 
  your translation is correct . 
  `` sweep '' makes no sense . 
  klap could be translated as either clap or punch . 
  i prefer punch , because it makes the fight against the two flies seem more epic somehow . 
   which is why a requirement for the turnout is ridiculous , and the referendumlaw should be improved . 
  dropping the turnout requirement would be the opposite of an improvement . 
  a system that would force people to vote simply because otherwise a tiny percentage of people could force their desired outcome on the entire country is a horrible fail of a system . 
  a 30 % required turnout is still way too low to avoid that entirely , but at least it 's better than considering a referendum where only 0.1 % of the populace votes to be valid because we dropped the turnout requirements . 
  do n't be ridiculous !, 
  no , just a few bottles of sewer runoff . 
  you do know that water has memory , right ? 
  the voters knew this was the right thing to vote for , so all that was necessary was collect the water the voters once showered in and make the legislators drink that . 
  ( it might have been pee , not shower water . 
  but who cares ! ), 
   there is a silver lining here ; there is going to be a huge amount of scrutiny by the scientific authorities and the state as this goes on hopefully . 
  but not necessarily . 
  just google fan death and korea . 
  the belief that leaving an electric fan on while you sleep can kill you is repeated by government officials . 
  it does n't matter how many scientists ( including their own ) tell them it 's ridiculous . 
  it 's entirely possible that in the case of switzerland , it wo n't get serious scrutiny until after people end up dead because they thought homeopathy was a legitimate treatment for cancer . 
  that really should n't be necessary . 
  it 's not like there 's any doubt it does n't fucking work . 
  i had an annoying argument with a guy at work about homeopathy . 
  he commented that it worked for him once when the subject came up ; after which i explained that what worked for him was the placebo , and that the homeopathic drug did fuck all . 
  he then conceded that okay , the drug does n't work . 
  but homeopathy totally still works because look , placebo effect !, 
  the argument that he could get the exact same effect from any other kind of placebo ( including , as some studies suggest , placebos you 're actually aware are placebos ) never registered . 
  to this day , whenever the subject happens to come up , he proudly maintains that people who dismiss homeopathy as nonsense do n't know what they 're talking about . 
  and this guy is pretty intelligent in most other respects as far as i can tell . 
  what you said in regards to people coming out of their education more dogmatic than analytic is , i expect , common in practically every field . 
  education systems do n't really teach people how to think critically . 
  they might be taught how to apply selective and focused critical thought relevant to a particular subject or profession ; but the general mindset of a skeptic is n't something that 's easily taught . 
   that would be harder to do thought . 
  [ not really ] ( https://danielmiessler.com/blog/no-jesus-did-not-soften-the-old-testament-in-fact-he-did-the-opposite-and-heres-what-that-means/ )  it is . 
  paul wrote about it pretty clear . 
  [ not really ] ( http://www.ucg.org/bible-study-tools/booklets/the-new-covenant-does-it-abolish-gods-law/paul-regularly-used-the-old )  like who ? 
  christians ( except maybe some very fringe groups nobody knows about ) never followed ot laws , since the very foundation of christianity . 
  okay so , christians do n't follow the ten commandments ( ironically , this one largely seems true ) ? 
  additionally then , christians : * do n't pray ? 
  * christians do n't honor the wise ? 
  ( sounds about right ) * engage in circumcision ? 
  ( lots of christians do , just look at the us ) * recite grace after meals ? 
  * do n't love all human beings who are of the covenant ? 
  * stand idly by while a life is in danger ? 
  * cherish hatred in their hearts ? 
  * take revenge ? 
  * bear grudges ? 
  * do n't help neighbours ? 
  * afflict widows and orphans ? 
  * do n't give charity ? 
  * do n't love strangers ? 
  * smite and curse their parents ? 
  * do n't believe in marriage ? 
  * withhold food from their wives ? 
  * commit incest ? 
  * engage in adultery ? 
  * engage in beastiality ? 
  * commit fraud ? 
  * refuse to pay proper wages ? 
  * curse with god 's name ? 
  i could go on . 
  either christians still follow ot laws , or all of the above things are true . 
  christians * do * follow ot laws ; they just pick and choose from among them . 
   that 's the very reason why christianity is not judaism . 
  no , the reason christianity is not judaism is because christians think jesus was the messiah and jews do n't . 
   nt is pretty clear about what this ` fulfillment ' means . 
  if by pretty clear , you mean `` not at all '' . 
   i 'm not going to elaborate , you can easily google it to get what it means of course you 're not going to elaborate . 
  and yes , you can google this interpretation and find support for it . 
  but you can also google the exact fucking opposite and get just as much support for it as well . 
  the nt is * not * at all clear about it the way you claim . 
   what it accomplished is people not following ot laws , which is a good thing . 
  except for all the ones that they did and ( sometimes ) continue to follow . 
  it did n't really accomplish anything other than give modern christians an excuse to not have to follow all the rules that are obviously psychotic and absurd , and lets them pick and choose from the menu according to their own whims . 
  this is not a good thing . 
   christian ca n't be someone who does n't follow christ . 
  also known as the the no true scotsman fallacy . 
  find a christian with a different interpretation than yours that you do n't like ? 
  well , they 're obviously not a real christian . 
   i know that i am wasting time , but here one of the passage : you 're wasting your time * because there are passages that say pretty much the exact opposite . 
  *  think not that i am come to send peace on earth : ** i came not to send peace , but a sword . 
  ** matthew 10:34  here , how jesus treated sinners and non believers ( spiritually sick according to christianity ) and here 's what is said about those who do n't believe :  whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life . 
  he that believeth not is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god . 
  he that believeth not the son shall not see life ; ** but the wrath of god abideth on him ** john 3:36  for moses truly said unto the fathers , a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you . 
  and it shall come to pass , that every soul , which will not hear that prophet , ** shall be destroyed from among the people . 
  ** acts 3:23  and whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet . 
  verily i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city . 
  matthew 10:14  but he answered and said unto them , why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition ? 
  for god commanded , saying , honour thy father and mother : and , he that curseth father or mother , ** let him die the death ** .
