  it is downright ** stupid ** to change your views on something like the eu because your precious little feelings got hurt by someone on the internet . 
  it 's also incredibly ironic how you 're trying to turn this around on the rest of us . 
  you 're blaming * us * for * you * changing * your * views , saying how * we * need to take responsibility for it ? 
  what is this madness ? 
  ** you ** are responsible for ** your ** views . 
  and let 's be clear here ; you * already * had these views , and are just using this claimed behavior of this sub ( behavior that an objective viewing of the sub would not show to be endemic but rather just part of the diversity of opinion on offer here ) as an excuse to justify them . 
  the alternative is your views being so completely arbitrary that even the lightest tap can push you over into any direction . 
  which frankly , makes any view you end up with completely meaningless . 
  sorry , but it 's just ridiculous to change your opinion of a pan-continental union with a population of over half a billion people because of what a couple of internet commentators said one time . 
  that 's why he 's being downvoted . 
  and you 're being downvoted for defending such silliness . 
  ... because some people on the internet were mean to you ? 
  so you changed your political beliefs in life ... ... because some people on the internet were mean to you ? 
  take it however you want . 
  i 'm going to do something more useful . 
  you know what . 
  i 'm just going to go to bed instead of continuing to engage in this futile discussion . 
   my argument was that the ranking in the index is extremely implausible for countries whose media landscape i know well , meaning that i dont consider it trustworthy . 
  meaning `` i do n't like the media in this country , therefore this ranking that disagrees with my dislike is wrong '' . 
  got it . 
   prediction of the future is just the relevant metric to measure understanding . 
  that is how science works . 
  tetlock deals with long-term predictions by pundits of changes in the political landscape . 
  pundits do not by and large constitute scientists . 
  nor does political science constitute an exact science . 
  there is a huge difference between trying to forecast what the political landscape will be like in 10 years , versus trying to forecast a couple of months into the future . 
  not to mention a huge difference with regular scientific predictions . 
   that is where you go wrong . 
  thank you for that expert opinion . 
  and yes , that is sarcasm . 
   if i know that there is something fishy then which you do n't know . 
  you just assert . 
  because it fits your beliefs . 
   when we are at expert opinions , maybe it helps if i confront you with expert opinions you are sure to distrust : consensus of theologians is that god exists . 
  which is of course a false equivalency . 
  the question of whether or not god exists falls outside the ability of theologians to determine . 
  it would be like declaring it is the consensus of tom cruise fans that he is the best actor in history . 
   or maybe more political : expert consensus of intelligence researchers is that there are genetic group differences in intelligence , sorry , no . 
  this is * not * the consensus position ( though i consider the fact that you assert it to be quite telling , as i do the fact that you start from the assumption that i would distrust such a consensus ) ; in fact , this is a subject on which there is a great deal of scientific debate with studies going both ways . 
  there is no consensus either way , though the preponderance of evidence generally leads to a conclusion that does * not * support the notion that the iq gap is attributable to group genetics . 
  if scientists ever did arrive at a solid consensus on the matter that suggests the opposite however , then that is what i 'll go with . 
   how ? 
  the desperate self-justifying you 're engaging in . 
  everything you 're saying is n't really aimed at anything external , it 's aimed at protecting your internal narrative . 
  rather than stop for even a second to consider that perhaps i have a point , you jump from argument to argument to argument . 
  i have to be wrong , because i probably have n't read tetlock . 
  i have to be wrong because i probably ca n't calculate a brier score . 
  i have to be wrong because i probably just got ` duped ' by something because it seems ` sciencey ' . 
  conversely , if i 'm wrong about these things , then in your mind that must mean that you 're right . 
  i 'll leave aside the fallacious nature of these points ; that 's not particularly relevant . 
  what * is * relevant , however slightly , is that these points you bring up do n't even have anything to do with i was saying in the first place . 
  appearances to the contrary . 
  to start with , tetlock 's expert political judgement deals with political predictions of the future and the lack of accuracy that come with them . 
  that 's fair enough ( although we 're talking about consensus opinion , whereas tetlock 's talking about individual predictions being bunk , which kind of supports the value of consensus opinion over individual opinions ) ; but that says exactly * nothing * about the value of expert opinion regarding the * present * . 
  and it certainly does n't tell us anything about expert consensus that falls outside the realm of political predictions . 
  if you have a consensus of doctors declaring that you have cancer , you 'd be an idiot to ignore them . 
  and if there is a concensus of reporters saying that the press freedoms in country a are better than those in country b , it would be foolish to assert that you know better . 
  incidentally , tetlock 's more recent work seems kind of at odds with ` expert political judgement '' . 
  perhaps you ought to update your library . 
  you 're just proving my point for me . 
  shit . 
  now my joke does n't work anymore !, 
   and you have seen this pattern with me ? 
  yes . 
   i dont believe it . 
  of course you do n't . 
  exactly as i said you would . 
  and just as i also said you would , you 're still just seeking to justify your narrative . 
   that is just the complete aleviation of personal responsibility on your own part . 
  you dont think foryourself , quite explicitely . 
  which is hardly a valid conclusion to draw . 
  thinking for myself is what allowed me to recognize the value of testing my own opinions against the expert consensus in the first place . 
  it is a means of preventing myself from reaching false conclusions as a result of the personal biases that i , as a human being , carry with me . 
  it is unfortunate that you do not appear to recognize this . 
  it is also ironic that your apparent rejection of it ; especially in this context ; fits so very neatly into the ` post-truth ' mindset that appears to be growing among both the world 's media and those that consume it . 
   how so ? 
  there is a distinct pattern of you rejecting positions , expert analysis , studies , and so on , whenever they happen to not fit into your internal narrative . 
  instead of recognizing this pattern and drawing the proper conclusions ; you seem instead to be interested solely in justifying your rejections in order to maintain whatever narrative sits within your head ; as so many people tend to do . 
  it 's a shame that you probably are n't going to recognize this no matter what i 'll say , and will instead almost certainly choose to continue pushing that internal narrative . 
  i however , will be rejecting your narrative and the justifications for it that you 've thought up , and go with the independent consensus of experts on the subject . 
  it 's the only logical choice , after all . 
   any index that gives austria high ratings in comparison to the united states is positively insane , knowing the media landscape in both countries . 
  or quite possibly you 're the one who ` se insane . 
  that is certainly more plausible than it being some sort of conspiracy , or all those independent observers and experts being wrong while some random dude on the internet with an axe to grind holds the truth . 
  that , or you failed to distinguish between ` freedom of press ' and ` quality of press ' . 
  the index does n't measure the quality of the reporting . 
  although even then it would be pretty unreasonable to claim the us media landscape holds a higher level of quality than a country like austria . 
   and you fell for it because it is flattering to your ideology . 
  the irony of this statement is off the charts . 
  are you for fucking real ? 
  maybe look at its methodology ? 
  if you ca n't trust a report on press freedom by reporters without borders then you might as well give up because you 're not going to find a more trustworthy source . 
  for the record , [ the netherlands ranks 2nd in the world for press freedom ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking ) . 
   you mean swuitzerland the only democracy with a similarly permissive attitude towards freedom of speech ? 
  that 's one . 
  there 's also the netherlands , which has enjoyed one form of democracy or another since 1581 ; except for its brief occupation by france and later germany . 
   having it overthrown internally ist the problem . 
  so we 're not counting the civil war then ? 
  because the netherlands is in essentially the same boat as the us when it comes to that . 
  never overthrown internally except as a result of our civil war , but only because we had the misfortune of suffering a direct french intervention .
