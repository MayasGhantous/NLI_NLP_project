   turkish citizens have travel restrictions and can not settle just like that ; they have to go through an asylum process . 
  for kazakh people it is even harder . 
  you can threaten people from specific communities with sanctions when it comes to gaining citizenship . 
  i honestly do n't know how someone who claims to be a constitutional lawyer could misunderstand the topic at hand to such a degree . 
  no , this does not constitute threathening specific communities with sanctions but not others . 
  sanctions are * active * forms of punishment , what you describe are not sanctions aimed against specific communities , but rather a lack of arrangements ( a-la schengen ) that make it easier for people from those countries to immigrate here . 
  those are not sanctions . 
  furthermore , it is n't even remotely what we were talking about ; which was sanctioning minority communities * within * the netherlands for failing to uphold certain standards . 
  now first of all , these `` certain '' standards you strongly implied to be entirely arbitrary notions of ` dutchness ' ; but even assuming you meant things that are actually illegal ; it would still not be possible under constitutional law to sanction an entire community . 
  unless of course you could somehow prove that * every single member * of said community is guilty of actual crimes instead of the crime of ` not being dutch enough ' for you . 
  and as someone claiming to be a constitutional lawyer , you would in fact be well aware of this . 
  so i can only conclude that either you 're not an actual lawyer ; or you 're letting your personal feelings cloud your interpretation of clear-cut laws . 
  for the sake of this country , i sincerely hope the latter is not the case . 
   i would argue even they are less problematic and conservative than the average person from the moroccan community i 'm sure you would . 
   the average muslim is miles away from the average dutch person in terms of the parameters we just spoke of . 
  and those parameters are completely and utterly irrelevant . 
  you can not sanction them for having different values and beliefs . 
  so long as they do n't break any laws , there 's nothing you can do . 
   i know of little petty crime and violence committed by conservative christians in the netherlands ( whereas out of 10 or so instances of violent acts committed in my direct surroundings i know of -- one of which led to permanent paralysis -- the vast majority have been committed ` zinloos ' by moroccans ) so first , we have a self-proclaimed constitutional lawyer under the impression that anecdotes constitute valid authoritative evidence . 
  which is terrifying . 
  and secondly , we have a self-proclaimed lawyer apparently unaware of the role socio-economic factors play in this issue . 
  which is severely dissappointing . 
   people would like to see those problems go away and minder marokkanen through remigration , assimilation and extradition would help . 
  and you * seriously * think that treating them like 2nd class citizens until they meet your standards is going to convince people to assimilate ? 
  that right there is probably the main reason why i have never been able to take the alt-right seriously on this topic . 
  it is so blatantly obvious that their rhetoric and dream-policies can accomplish * nothing * except a worsening of the things they find problematic . 
  the animal cops is pretty much the only thing that the pvv set out to do and accomplished ... ... but not really since it mostly fell apart when the pvv blew up that government ; it was supposed to be 500 cops permanently working full-time in the division . 
  which stopped the moment the government fell . 
  only some of them are still working on animal-issues full-time . 
   and i 'm trying to argue that it 's only for the last 30-40 years that 's been the case . 
  so what ? 
  it did n't used to be the case that women were seen as equal either . 
  should i pretend it makes sense for people to argue that women should n't have the same rights because people used to think that way and some people feel like it still matters ? 
  and neither should i pretend it makes sense to treat people differently based on the arbitrary and * ridiculous * notion that it somehow matters that their genetic line frolicked about within the arbitrary borders of a country 10 generations ago , instead of just 8 , or 6 , or 2 . 
   being dutch ( which implies so much more than cultural behaviour ) is n't necessarily about ice-skating , eating bitterballen , smoking weed and cycling to work . 
  these things are arbitrary and politically irrelevant . 
  except people decide ( subconsciously ) who they see as dutch based precisely , in some part , on seemingly irrelevant things like that . 
  it * is * arbitrary , but when it is nonetheless the criteria people unwittingly use to decide whom to accept , it is not irrelevant to the conversation ; because it informs peoples views . 
   he things which are important when it comes to being dutch are how you treat women , people who are homosexual , even how you treat people in the streets ( intimidation and territoriality ) and values such as free speech and the simple right to practice your ( lack of ) beliefs without sanction , if it does not harm other people . 
  while i agree that these things are the things that are actually important ; these are also things that are n't always visible ; and these criteria do not get applied to white christians in the bible belt , who do n't accept homosexuals , do n't accept women as equal , and do n't accept secularism . 
  why is a fundamentalist muslim who was born here not dutch based on those criteria , but a fundamentalist white christian who was born * is * considered dutch despite it ? 
   secondarily , being dutch is also about how we interact with each other in society -- etiquette , mannerisms , mentality etc. 
  except this varies from city to city and province to province . 
  people from below the rivers are just as dutch as those from the north ; despite the fact their mannerisms , mentality , and etiquette can be radically different . 
  double standard , is what we call that . 
   ( which is possibly to become a majority community over the years if history is anything to go by and already seems to be more dominant just by virtue of behaviour ) . 
  that is not possible ; and can be easily shown so when you look at actual statistical trends . 
   it is wise to discriminate based on nationality if this is a valid denominator no . 
  it is not . 
  aside from the fact that doing so is a blatant violation of the constitution ( and the principles upon which this nation is founded ) ; by doing so you actually make the problem * worse * . 
   it is also perfectly legal . 
  what is illegal is to unfairly discriminate . 
  it is not legal ** . 
  the equality principle in the constitution does ** not ** specify `` unfairly '' . 
  we ** can not ** threathen specific communities with sanctions for failing to uphold certain standards , and not others . 
  either you threathen everyone with those sanctions . 
  or no one . 
  a german dictating to us who ` se dutch and who is n't ? 
  mate . 
  step off . 
  actually yes , it was quite comparable . 
  the amount of immigration that happened in the 17th century was nothing short of massive ; and often involved groups of `` undesirable '' religion . 
  more than a third of amsterdam 's population in the 17th century was comprised of immigrants . 
  in places like leiden it was even more than half . 
  and yes , some of the rhetoric and policies against immigration back then are very reminiscent of the rhetoric and proposals we hear today . 
  but we know which side of history was in the right back then . 
   you dont sound like a very reasonable person yourself to be honest an assessment that i do n't give much credence to . 
  but thanks , i guess . 
  feel better now ? 
   pim fortuyn , who was demonized and murdered ah yes . 
  the old `` he was demonized and murdered because of it !, 
  and you 're trying to do it to wilders ! '' . 
  we 're supposed to shut our traps and keep our opinions about wilders to ourselves , because ` what if he gets murdered too ? 
  ' , it 'll be our fault !, 
  an argument that did n't impress wilders and those like him when people pointed out that breivik was strongly influenced by him . 
   you will notice it was a very intelligent eloquent man who dis manage to get his point across . 
  why is that we always only declare the people we already agree with as intelligent and eloquent ? 
   but you sound very very similar to wilders voters yourself . 
  why ? 
  because i 'm sick and tired of having to listen to the anger that people fail to back up with arguments ? 
  sick of having to pretend to agree with the claim that wilders is some fresh anti-establishment voice of change despite being one of the longest seated politicians in the 2e kamer ? 
  sick of having to pretend like an undemocratic party that does n't allow any members other than geert wilders himself so that he can run the party like his own private dictatorship represents a valid contribution to our democracy ? 
   you neglect to acknowledgd it is not a loud minority , and this has been the argument all over and the brexit , trump , referendum against ukraine , ratings of lepen and wilders all prove this . 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  yes . 
  it is a loud minority . 
  it might have escaped your notice , but brexit happened in the uk ... which is not the netherlands . 
  and trump happened in the us ... which is also not the netherlands . 
  as for the ukraine referendum ? 
  again , loud minority . 
  yes , most of the people who bothered to vote on it voted against it . 
  but the turnout was the bare minimum . 
  61 % voted against , but that 's 61 % of only 32 % eligible to vote that bothered to show up . 
  i hope you understand basic math , because that 61 % is a minority . 
  ratings of lepen have nothing to do with the netherlands . 
  and the ratings of wilders ** prove ** that his followers are a minority because no matter how big he polls at , he does not poll at anywhere near 51 % of all votes . 
   you claim they are political irrelevant which is simply dumb after what weve seen the past ten years . 
  no , that 's exactly what we 've seen the past 10 years . 
  name a single law that the pvv has introduced and passed . 
  name anything at all that they had a hand in accomplishing .
