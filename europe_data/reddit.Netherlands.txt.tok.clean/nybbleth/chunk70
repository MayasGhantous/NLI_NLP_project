  they 've accomplished * nothing * . 
  all they 've done is complain . 
  people like wilders do n't care to actually do anything . 
  the only thing he cares about is his career . 
  he gets paid to be a professional shit-stirrer . 
  if he actually wanted to change anything . 
  if he wanted to do any of the shit he promises ; he would try to build consensus . 
  he would reach out across the aisle and build alliances . 
  he would come up with more than an a4 as his party program , because he would need to build credibility not among his voters , but among the rest of the political world because that is the only way he 's ever going to change anything . 
  he knows this . 
  you apparently , do not . 
  better than letting them spew their bowels all over the place so much that we start accepting it as normal . 
  which means nothing . 
  `` i do n't see it happening , therefore it 's not happening . '', 
  i guarantee you that indo 's that do n't look white still have to deal with racism . 
  not overt racism ; but racism nonetheless . 
  grab a bunch of people from different ethnicities , dress them up the same way , and have them each hang out in different nice suburbs all day , just walking around , not bothering anyone . 
  see what happens . 
  see who gets the cops called on them . 
  plenty of experiments and studies show that the color of your skin very much still causes you to be seen different . 
  how can you claim that they 're seen as truly dutch when it 's so easy to demonstrate that a black guy will be seen as ` suspicious ' or ` dangerous ' at a far higher rate than a white guy doing the exact same fucking thing ? 
  dressed the same way ? 
   other angry , loud minorities : lgbt groups . 
  what % of the population belong to any of those ? 
  not many . 
  why should we listen to them then ? 
  are you under the impression that `` treating minorities with basic respect and give them the right to be who they are '' is somehow on the same fucking footing as `` arghblargh , kick out the fucking foreigners '' ? 
   how laughable to call reduced immigration from third world countries a ` fantasy ' . 
  how laughable that you see national pride as ` not remotely realistic ' . 
  it * is * a fantasy . 
  the alt-right is apparently laboring under the collective delusion that our constitution , and the international treaties that we are legally bound by , can simply be tossed to the side with ease . 
  they ca n't . 
  it is fantasy . 
  what you 're proposing violates our constitutional law . 
  and it is impossible for the pvv to get a large enough majority to change it . 
  deal with it . 
  who the fuck is talking about policing thought ? 
  i 'm merely pointing out that people are unaware of * how much * of a problem this still is . 
  it 's ** not ** just `` some people '' . 
   when you 're talking about islam in the netherlands , that is not what 's happening . 
  i love being told by americans what 's happening in my country . 
  reading an article on the internet totally qualifies you to make such declarations . 
  meanwhile , i 'll be here , in the netherlands , with all my muslim neighbours who are perfectly normal people who share most of my values and whom i 've never had any problems with , apparently living in john lennon dream land despite the fact that of the two of us , i 'm the only one with actual hands-on experience of what life is like here . 
  if pvv voters decide their vote based on reading internet comments they do n't like ; then pvv voters deserve nothing less than the scorn they so complain about . 
  in that case they will forever be politically irrelevant . 
  this is a multi-party democracy that operates on consensus and coalitions . 
  they will never get enough votes to form a government by themselves . 
  if they want change ; they have to convince others . 
  not just the minority of the population that will vote for them . 
  which has fuck all to do with what we 're talking about . 
  except brandenburg v. ohio actually ruled that speech that incites or is likely to lead to imminent lawless action ** is in fact ** banned . 
  so while technically yes , it 's legal to yell fire in a crowded theater ; yelling `` that black dude started a fire !, 
  at a kkk rally is very much illegal . 
  which honestly is n't really all that different from dutch legislation . 
   it goes back more than a generation or two . 
  it does n't . 
  there 's no such attribute defining what an ancestor is . 
  it is simply one who came before you in your genetic line . 
  so all those black people whose parents or grandparents were born in the uk ? 
  yep ; ethnic brits according to your definition . 
  and why should we let an angry but loud * minority * dictate to the rest of us what should be changed ? 
  if anything at all ? 
  if they want change , they 'll have to provide a positive argument for it . 
  something they have always failed to do . 
  they complain we do n't listen . 
  so we listen ; and when we do it turns out that they ca n't even properly explain what they 're angry about . 
  just that they 're angry !, 
  and that we should listen !, 
  and when some of them manage , finally , to formulate something resembling a coherent explanation of what they 're upset about , they fail to provide arguments sufficient to convince anyone who does n't already share their anger to begin with . 
  and solutions as to the problems they 're angry about ? 
  only fantasies . 
  never anything remotely realistic . 
  so indeed , i suppose it 's a fair question : why the fuck are we listening to these people , instead of ignoring them like they so very much deserve ? 
  i would have to see how they 've phrased the question to draw any final conclusions . 
  although regardless of how its phrased , one can only conclude that those christians are full of shit on at least some level . 
  you ca n't believe in a supreme being that hands down laws , and then believe that human laws are somehow more important . 
  those are two logically incompatible notions . 
  we do let them speak . 
  constantly . 
  they 're being heard . 
  still they complain they 're not not being heard . 
  but that 's because the problem is n't that we 're not listening to them ... we * are * listening . 
  the problem is that we 're not falling over ourselves to agree with them . 
  that 's what they really want . 
  nay , what they so obviously want to * demand * . 
   america was founded on mass migration , the netherlands was not . 
  actually , the birth of the netherlands as an independent nation-state went hand in hand with immigration . 
  and high immigration directly contributed to our development and success as a great power . 
  but this so often gets overlooked . 
  so few people are even , for example , aware that during the 17th century , our golden age , there were multiple mosques in amsterdam . 
  there were immigrants from all over the world living here . 
  bringing wealth and knowledge . 
  the netherlands has always been a crossroads of cultures , and we have always been at our most succesful , and our most powerful , in times when we were open and tolerant . 
  you might want to talk to some surinamers about this ; because i guarantee you that you 'll find that no matter how much they integrate , they still very much face the belief from others that they 're not dutch . 
  not integrated . 
  not fully part of our society . 
  people would be surprised at how much skin color is still an issue here . 
  although given people 's reactions to the zwarte piet controversy , it really is n't surprising that they 'd be surprised . 
  and how many christians think the laws of god are more important than the laws of the country ? 
  the answer is : all of them ( at least if they take their beliefs halfway seriously ) .
