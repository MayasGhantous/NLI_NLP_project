  after all , they believe god is the supreme being of all of existence . 
  so of course they think his laws outrank secular laws . 
  so why are n't you talking about * that * ? 
  you ... you do realize that includes a fucktonne of black and asian people , right ? 
  if their parents were born in the uk , then their ancestors come from the uk ; parents are no less your ancestors than some dude who passed his genes down the line a thousand years ago . 
  and if you insist on defining it along ancient ancestral lines ; then most white citizens of the uk are n't ethnic brits either ; since they 're mostly descendent from anglo-saxon invaders . 
  yes , the pvv voter loves to play the victim ; claiming that they 're not being listened to , that the media silences them ... ... which they 've talked about * at length * in the media ; like in certain well-known shows on national television ... while prominent liberal politicians sit at the table ... genuinely listening to them and asking them to explain their views ; which they subsequently fail to do , while rolling their eyes at the politicians for asking questions even though mere minutes earlier they were complaining the politicians were n't listening to them . 
  it 's such a fucking joke . 
  their concerns are being listened to . 
  but what 's become abundantly clear after all the interviews and all the rants , is that what they mean when they say they want to be listened to is actually `` i demand you agree with me . '', 
  this is obviously not true . 
  the netherlands has free speech ( right alongside freedom of publication ) enshrined in its constitution in the form of article 7 . 
  the fact that incitement of hatred/violence is not legal , does n't mean that the netherlands does n't have free speech anymore than the fact that you ca n't yell fire in a crowded theater mean america does n't have freedom of speech . 
  though those who desire to do either might be quick to argue otherwise . 
   he gave an interview right after he said it , in which he stated he was only talking about criminal moroccans . 
  but he * did n't * say it for the occasion he was prosecuted for . 
  later rectification is not legally relevant . 
   and your opinion is not in line with science , giant hogweed is n't native to the netherlands even when it seeds itself there . 
  citizenship is not a matter of science . 
  it 's a matter of law . 
  your analogy makes no fucking sense . 
   their norms and values do not abide by the law . 
  says you . 
   that 's only if you think i speak my mind outside of the internet , most people do n't do that , especially a lot of ` people in this country ' oh i 'm sorry , by `` in public '' , did you mean on the curb around the block ? 
  is the internet not public enough ? 
   unless you live on the islands that 's the norm . 
  you 're spending far too much energy on your ideology to declare yourself apathetic . 
   which were biased to begin with , but it 's alright as their claim wo n't pass cassation . 
  you presume yourself far too qualified to speak on legal matters for someone who does n't even know the constitution . 
   if they do not feel this way , then clearly the statement that wilders made does not apply to them and they do n't have any reason to be afraid , or feel discriminated against . 
  no , clearly they absolutely do ; because he never said `` imma only get rid of these specific ones '' . 
  he never specified . 
  he simply said `` moroccans . '', 
   yes , and a hamster that was born in an aquarium is a fish . 
  you may think that 's cute ; but dutch law is ** very clear ** about this . 
  they 're dutch . 
  period . 
  your opinion is not in line with legal fact . 
   they 're also expected to share the norms and values that come with it . 
  they 're not . 
  they 're expected to abide by the * laws * . 
  `` norms and values '' are not defined by law ; nor is any citizen of this country expected to share such a nebulous set of ideas . 
   dutch values are n't difficult , just act normal , then you 're already acting weird enough . 
  not difficult , you say ? 
  because you 're not acting in a way that i and a hell of a lot of people in this country would consider to be `` normaal '' . 
  so , given your rhetoric , i think it 's safe to say you need to get the fuck out of this country then ? 
   just be as apathic as possible , is n't that what we 're famous for ? 
  in that case you 're failing once again on the dutchness scale . 
  get the fuck out . 
   in the interview that was held afterwards he said he only meant criminal moroccans , those are also the ones that identify as moroccan instead of dutch , and do n't respect our government , laws and values . 
  which was deemed irrelevant by the public prosecutor ; and it seems , the judges . 
  he prepared that speech for well over a week in advance . 
  it was n't some off-the-cuff remark . 
  he knew exactly what he was saying . 
  his later clarification is pretty weak . 
   most moroccans in the netherlands do not identify as dutch citizens , they identify with a foreign entity , they do not practise dutch cultural norms and values , and quite often even oppose them . 
  this is not relevant . 
  first of all ; you 're just asserting that most of them feel this way . 
  no evidence given . 
  more importantly , it does n't fucking matter . 
  they were born in the netherlands , and hold dutch citizenship . 
  by ** definition ** they are dutch . 
  and as such are entitled to the rights and protections that come with it . 
  those rights and protections are not something to be applied selectively on the basis of you feeling they 're not `` dutch '' enough . 
  besides , what the hell does it even mean to `` not practice dutch cultural norms and values '' ? 
  i do n't practice much of those either , but somehow i get a free pass . 
  exactly how many points on the list of `` dutch cultural norms and values '' must someone hit before you 'll accept them as dutch enough ? 
  does not liking cheese on your bread give a penalty to your score ? 
  how much will your score go up if you eat stamppot once a week ? 
  what about contradictory values and traditions ? 
  i mean , wearing clogs is pretty traditionally dutch , but so is making fun of them , so if i want to max out my dutchness score , what do i do ? 
   wilders is n't saying ` deport everyone with a moroccan family history ' , he 's saying ` deport those that identify as moroccan citizens ' because they 've clearly got no reason to be here at all . 
  no , that 's what * you * are saying . 
  that 's not what wilders has said , at all . 
  maybe that 's all he meant ( i seriously fucking doubt it ) ; but it 's not what he said . 
  his popularity is vastly overstated i feel . 
  the way you hear some people talking about him you 'd think most of the country agrees with him ; but even if the polls were dead-on and he 'd end up with a commanding lead over all the other parties , he 'd still represent only a * minority * of the country . 
  sure , there 's a lot of people who agree with him ; but ** far more ** that do n't . 
  but those people are n't as loud and visible as he and his followers are . 
  it 's true that turkish women gained the right to vote before some european countries ... ... it 's also true that quite a lot of european women got it long before any turkish ones did . 
  being middle of the pack is nothing to boast about , turkey . 
  that 's a ridiculous argument . 
  there 's all sorts of reasons why someone could support it and still not come out to vote . 
  you do n't know why they did n't ; you can not say they do n't support it . 
  at best you can say that they do n't support it enough to make the effort of voting ; but that does n't mean they do n't support it . 
  there 's lots of things i support without necessarily making the effort of doing so actively . 
  i 'm sure the same is true for you . 
  an often repeated hypothesis , but one that does n't fit plato 's description at all . 
  the consensus is that plato invented atlantis for the sake of allegory ; and drew inspiration from various sources ( which may or may not have included the minoans ), 
  62 % of people who voted , supported it . 
  but turnout was only 60.5 % . 
  so i 'm really not sure what you 're complaining about . 
  it 's entirely possible ( likely even , i 'd say ) that if they 'd forced everyone to vote , they 'd have gotten a result more closely aligned with this poll . 
  the notion that immigration comes at the expense of the middle-class is one that has zero actual evidence for it . 
  and is dispelled by various studies . 
  with half a billion people ? 
  yes . 
  with a few million more or less ? 
  hardly . 
   can you recommend any books written on the netherlands not really .
