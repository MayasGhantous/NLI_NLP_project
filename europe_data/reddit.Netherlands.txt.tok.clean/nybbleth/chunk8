  if one person can support one thing with the book , and another person can support the exact opposite with it ; maybe stop using the damn book as a source for shit ? 
  the world would be ever so slightly a better place . 
  well , my calender is full of days and months named after pre-christian gods and figures , for one . 
   that make you come across as a militant fundie . 
  so ... what ? 
  he was a jew , and he came back from the dead . 
  how does that not make him a jewish zombie ? 
  and how does that make me come across as a militant fundie ? 
  i do n't think you understand what either of those words mean . 
   so i thought , well how about those 1000 + years , that 's heritage . 
  which is about as useful as responding to a question about human heritage with : `` well how about those 100,000 + years , that 's heritage '' . 
  yes , thank you . 
  i think we all know the concept of time passing by . 
  da fuq , whoever wrote that translation that should be taken out back and shot . 
  okay , that 's maybe a little extreme . 
  i suppose you could translate it that way ... if for some reason you decided that the perfectly functional and understandable literal translation was n't poetic enough . 
   and has had an impact on everything from architecture to literature to figures of speech . 
  ah but see ; i 'm not asking whether it had an impact on those things . 
  of course it had . 
  but * why * is that something we should ` defend ' or hold to be special in any way ? 
  lots of things had an impact on architecture , literature , and figures of speech . 
  what makes christianity 's impact on those things special enough to raise it up above other such influences in terms of things we as a society should hold dear ? 
   i answered your first question , not your second . 
  that the west does , in fact , have christian heritage . 
  but you * did n't * answer my question , though . 
  i asked for * specifics * . 
  `` 1000 + years of christianity in society '' is n't specific , it 's the * opposite * of specific . 
  i want to know * specific examples * of christian heritage in our societies ; and i want to know why those specific examples are explicitly/exclusively christian , and why we should n't ignore them . 
   i 'm not a religious person but i do n't view christianity as `` evil '' , as you seem to . 
  imo , people like yourself are annoying and obnoxious . 
  too militant . 
  you 're basically a fundie atheist lol . 
  ah yes ... because asking why we should ` proudly defend our christian heritage ' and what exactly that even entails is totally a militant fundie thing to do . 
  / s i 'll give you the annoying and obnoxious thing though ; i can only imagine the frustration of having to deal with people who do n't consider `` b 'cause '' to be a valid answer in and of itself . 
  yes , because nothing says important like placing the `` do n't kill '' rule after these : * `` do n't have any other gods before me . 
  i will fucking hunt them down and kill them if you cheat on me . '', 
  ( the first commandment ) * `` do n't carve any idols , fuckers . '', 
  ( the 2nd commandment ) * `` do n't use my name you little bastards , not unless you really mean it . '', 
  ( the 3rd commandment ) * `` remember , sunday is a thing . 
  do n't forget . '', 
  ( the 4th commandment ) * `` honor mom and dad . 
  because they 're allowed to publically have you executed if you do n't . '', 
  ( the 5th comandment ) . 
  i guess sixth place is still pretty important ? 
   but you ca n't pretend that our entire western culture was n't birthed from christian worldviews . 
  well , i can ... because modern democracies and nationstates were birthed not * by * christianity , but by a populace that pushed back against the prevailing conservativism ( religious and otherwise ) of their day . 
  it is absurd to credit christianity with our culture ; christianity is but one influence on our culture ( and has in turn been strongly influenced by our culture ) ; and one that is no longer particularly relevant for many of our cultures . 
   i mean we are a capitalist bloc created by one ` protestant ethic ' country the uk and now presided over by another originally ` protestant ethic ' country the usa . 
  what . 
  who is we ? 
  the west was n't created by the uk . 
   every facet of the life we live as europeans or westerns is influence heavily by christianity . 
  but ... it 's not . 
  it 's really not . 
  the inventions of refridgeration or electricity are almost infinitely more influential on modern western life than christianity ( past or present ) . 
  by all means , be aware of the history of the religion and how it 's shaped the world over the centuries ... but do n't place it on some sort of pedestal . 
  which does n't answer my question . 
  in fact , it basically forces me to repeat it : why is that something we should not ignore , except as an example of what * not to do * ? 
   why are you telling me this ? 
  where were you when these europeans were making such generalizations ? 
  at home , eating dinner . 
  and you ca n't prove otherwise . 
   should i start quoting your national hero geert wilders ? 
  national hero ? 
  i 'm sure he wishes he was , as do his followers . 
  but the majority of us still think he 's a dick . 
  nitpick : their name is n't ` the call of christian democracy ' ; it 's ` christian democratic appeal ' . 
  you have to consider that the cda is a very old party ; formed when christianity was much more important than it is now . 
  nowadays , the cda membership includes muslims , jews , and hindus . 
  the party 's politics is n't explicitly christian anymore . 
  it 's a centre-right party that draws some of its inspiration from christianity , but not exclusively . 
  they do n't really mention god much , if at all , in public discourse . 
  that 's not to say that there are n't many christians involved with the party who do feel strongly about religion , but that 's considered much more of a private individual thing , rather than `` this is what the party is about . '', 
  presumably you are aware that europe consists of different countries with different cultural views on the role of religion in politics ? 
  you are presumably also aware of the difference between a politician making a throwaway vague reference to ` christian values ' without it ending his career , and a politician openly saying that evolution is a lie without it ending his career . 
   but here i was always told by religious authorities that christianity bans killing in a war if you are n't defending your country from invader . 
  it very obviously does n't . 
  nowhere in the bible does it say that you can only kill people in a war if you 're defending your country from others . 
  it * does * repeatedly imply god is totally cool with invading others and wiping them from the face of the earth , though . 
  at least so long as they 're filthy heretics or pagans . 
  if religious authorities have told you otherwise , it 's probably because they realize that what the bible actually says on the matter is kind of psychotic and not very likely to meet with your stamp of approval . 
   you mistook christianity in something else . 
  and that something has absolutely nothing to do with christianity . 
  i 'm sorry , since when does the bible not have anything to do with christianity ? 
   if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them : then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ; and they shall say unto the elders of his city , this our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard . 
  and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that he die : so shalt thou put evil away from among you ; and all israel shall hear , and fear . 
  ( deuteronomy 28:18 -23 ), 
  you might want to read the bible then . 
  given how many times in the book god kills people and tells his followers to do the same , i expect it 's more of a christian value than you might think . 
  oh yes . 
  just look at what god had to say to the original refugees , the israelites :  say unto them , as truly as i live , saith the lord , as ye have spoken in mine ears , so will i do to you : ** your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ** ; and all that were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me . 
  ** doubtless ye shall not come into the land ** , concerning which i sware to make you dwell therein , save caleb the son of jephunneh , and joshua the son of nun . 
  but your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , them will i bring in , and they shall know the land which ye have despised . 
  but as for you , * your carcases , they shall fall in this wilderness . 
  ** and your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years , and bear your whoredoms , until your ** carcases be wasted in the wilderness . 
  ** ( numbers 14:28 -33 ) or other refugees :  when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it , and hath cast out many nations before thee , the hittites , and the girgashites , and the amorites , and the canaanites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites , seven nations greater and mightier than thou ; and when the lord thy god shall deliver them before thee ; ** thou shalt smite them , and utterly destroy them ; thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor shew mercy unto them . 
  ** ( deuteronomy 7:1 -2 ) that 's the beauty of the bible ; it 's such a haphazard and contradictory mess that you can use it to support any position you want . 
  also , lots of stuff about carcasses apparently , god 's favorite word . 
  what `` christian '' heritage would that be , exactly ? 
  specifically , what is it about the fact that people used to have their decisions be informed by their beliefs surrounding a magical zombie jew that we should n't ignore ; other than the knowledge that things have been so much better since we stopped making decisions based on it ?
