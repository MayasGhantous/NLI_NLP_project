  i do n't understand why this needs to be explained . 
   you ca n't buy alcohol online without age verification so why porn ? 
  what the fuck do these two things have to do with one another ? 
  the highest point in nl is actually in the carribean . 
  obviously food should be labelled properly , but the way some people react to these scandals you 'd think it was about human meat instead . 
  horse is pretty tasty . 
  not really . 
  that 's a consequence ( which did not occur everywhere i might add ) of improved conditions , not a cause . 
  the real reason for increased prosperity is that on one hand , labor was suddenly in much higher demand , and on the other hand because it resulted in more land being available . 
  as a result , landowners faced reduced fortunes , while lower classes enjoyed higher wages . 
  as a * consequence * , serfdom started to disappear . 
  with a shrinking population , gdp per capita will increase even during a recession so long as the rate at which the population shrinks is faster than gdp decline . 
  this is part of why , counter-intuitively , the massive depopulation of europe as a result of the plague led to rapid increases in standard of living . 
  and nowadays , with automation , a shrinking population does not equate recession . 
  it does n't even have to mean stagnation . 
  gdp can continue to grow even with negative population growth . 
  mr.president , we have received word that another civilization has finished building the great wall . 
  no , it does n't ; that only documents the ` notable ' cases ; or more precisely the tornadoes that wikipedia contributors thought notable . 
  the vast majority of tornado 's that occur in europe are mild and do little to no damage and are n't likely to be found on such lists . 
  i think people do n't really understand what the sexual revolution actually was . 
  it was * not * really about `` free love '' . 
  the sexual revolution was a response to the repressive attitudes regarding sex at the time . 
  it was about celebrating sex and its various forms as a normal and acceptable part of life . 
  * some * people took that towards open relationships and the sort , but that was hardly the crux of the revolution . 
  if you think that 's all the sexual revolution was you do n't really understand the subject . 
  the sexual revolution of the 60 's is what allowed things like contraception , abortion , pornography and premarital sex to become normal and accepted parts of modern society . 
  it has absolutely been a liberation , and it has absolutely not been ` turned back ' . 
  that 's ... idiotic . 
  are you imagining that wearing a condom to prevent diseases is somehow a reversal of the sexual revolution ? 
  despite the fact that the societal acceptance of birth-control was one of the major accomplishments of the sexual revolution in the first place ? 
  ( along with many other things ), 
  tornadoes have always been pretty common in europe , though the vast majority of them are fairly mild ( but f4 's and even f5 's do occur from time to time ) . 
  most people do n't even realize we have at least 300 or so tornadoes a year . 
  wait what ? 
  the sexual revolution was turned back ? 
  when did this happen ? 
  if only they 'd finished the [ st.lievensmonstertoren ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sint-lievensmonstertoren#/media/file:dikke_toren_1657.jpg ) in zeeland , the netherlands . 
  it was planned to be 204 meters tall , but they ran out of money after building the base . 
  right . 
  i 've had quite enough out of your disingenuous apologetics and strawmen . 
   so how do you reconcile that and your own comments that the full extend were n't known ? 
  are you fucking kidding ? 
  are you under the impression that `` well we knew people were being massacred to pursue ethnic cleansing , but we did n't know the exact numbers '' constitutes some sort of moral defense ? 
   ( and your own source that is saying that they didnt know that this would happen for sure . ), 
  oh my fucking god . 
  this again . 
  this is a child 's level of logic . 
  `` why did you put your brother in the hospital timmy ? '', 
  `` i did n't know that pushing him in front of that car would lead to him getting hit !, 
  it 's not my fault !, 
  i could n't be sure that 's what would happen ! '', 
  they had * multiple * warnings . 
  they were essentially * flat-out told * by the serbs that this was going to happen . 
  they have no excuse . 
  at this point you 're starting to sound like an apologist . 
  ah yes . 
  ofcourse . 
  / s `` voter fatigue '' . 
  people might get * tired * if you ask them for their opinion again !, 
  best just force this on them and ask them * forty fucking years * later if they were sure . 
  it 's disgraceful . 
  yes these types of things were known . 
  there were numerous reports of massacres taking place , years before srebrenica . 
  it was common knowledge , and there was plenty of evidence even back then . 
  for fuck 's sake , the un security council * itself * specifically warned way back in '93 that as many as 25,000 civilians could be murdered if the serbs were to take srebrenica . 
  that same year , karad\u017eic promised before the serb assembly that if his army entered srebrenica , there would be * ` blood up to the knees ' * . 
  similar sentiments were echoed by mladic in front of the assembly just months before the fall of srebrenica when he stated that the bosnian population should `` vanish completely '' . 
  not to mention this was around the same time the serbian military was under new combat directives to , and this is a direct quote , * `` create an unbearable situation of total insecurity of life with no hope of survival or life for inhabitants of srebrenica and \u017depa . 
  '' * all of this was known to western governments . 
  ** they knew exactly what the fuck they were inviting . 
  so ... you just reassert the same thing . 
  failed to adress anything that was brought up . 
  failed to justify how refusing to let people change their mind for forty whole fucking years is somehow without the bounds of democracy ... ... and then * still * managed to somehow to insist you 're the one on the side of democracy even though you 're the one refusing to let people have their democratic voice heard again ( probably because you already have the result you wanted . ), 
  i was right to not hold my breath . 
  rather than set up a poorly constructed strawman ( particularly one so ironic , given you seem to be scared of a 2nd referendum giving a different result ) , why do n't you instead explain why you * oppose * asking people if they 're really sure ; given all of the things i pointed out above ; until an entire generation passes , and how you can possibly * justify * that as being `` democratic '' . 
  i wo n't hold my breath . 
  `` we could n't be 100 % sure it would n't happen again here in this specific instance despite multiple warnings that it might and evidence that this sort of thing has happened before !, 
  our hands are clean ! '', 
  yeah . 
  that should convince absolutely * nobody * . 
  that 's the level of logic i used with my parents as a kid , hiding in technicalities and semantics . 
  i 'm not advocating having referendums in general . 
  they 're far too flawed and easily subverted ( as this and other referendums have demonstrated ) . 
  representative democracy generally works just fine on its own . 
  ... however . 
  ** if ** you have one to decide something so momentous ; and it passes by a margin so narrow as to result in having no genuine and clear mandate , and then it becomes increasingly clear how much lying occured on the side that won , * and * the situation starts getting into focus enough to start changing people 's minds , * and * on top of all of that you have a snap election designed to increase a government majority for the sole stated purpose of strengthening the uk 's position in brexit negotiations but end up with a complete clusterfuck of a result instead that forces the sitting government to ally themselves with utter crazies just to maintain some hope of actually getting to govern ... ... then you had better fucking ask people if they 're sure about all of this , or else it 's undeniably clear you * do not actually care * about the democratic will of the people and just want to steamroll ahead regardless of what people might think . 
  sounds pretty fucking undemocratic to me . 
  there 's reasons why we have elections every few years instead of every few decades . 
  one of those reasons is that situations and opinions ** change ** . 
  it is pretty damning for someone who appeals to ` democracy ' to then turn around and tell people that `` no , we 're not going to ask you for your opinion for another 40 years . '', 
  what are you afraid of ? 
  a different result ? 
  your country * not * going off the side of the cliff ? 
  a 2nd referendum setting a precedent that 'll lead to you being asked `` are you sure ? '', 
  on other issues in the future as well ? 
  it just does n't make any sense . 
  there were multiple massacres prior to srebrenica commited by various sides including the serbs . 
  they killed 2300 people in doboj , 2700 in fo\u010da , up to 3000 in vi\u0161egrad , and between 3 and 4000 in prijedor . 
  all long before srebrenica . 
  the full extent of these massacres were n't known by the un at the time ... but it was absolutely no secret that the serbs were conducting genocide .
