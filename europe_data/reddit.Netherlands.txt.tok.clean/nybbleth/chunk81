  did you read the article ? 
  it clearly mentions declassified documents that show they had secretly decided to suspend the use of airstrikes against the serbs ; which they did not inform their allies of ; in line with their belief the enclaves were the obstacle to peace . 
  it also clearly mentions that the intelligence agencies of both the us and the uk knew more than a month in advance that mladic intended to capture the three eastern enclaves and destroy them . 
  which * again * , they did not inform their allies of . 
  there is simply no denying that they knowingly allowed the enclave to fall . 
  they * may * have believed they could negotiate a peaceful handover ; but that delusion would have been impossible to maintain in the days leading up to the fall ... during which they * still * refused to allow airstrikes . 
  they were also repeatedly warned during this time that ethnic cleansing might occur . 
  there 's really no denying their responsibility . 
  that 's a big stretch . 
  yes , they did n't say : `` let 's let these people commit genocide '' , but at the time they already had extensive evidence that ethnic cleansing was commonplace in the war , and it just is n't possible that they would n't have realized there was a very good chance that it would take place again . 
  they decided to go forward with their plans anyway . 
  they * did * sacrifice 8000 civilian lives to have peace ; or at the very least were perfectly willing to gamble with those lives . 
  there 's also the damning fact that they `` neglected '' to mention any of this to their dutch allies . 
  the reason why they did n't is now of course painfully obvious . 
  they needed sacrificial pawns to take the blame . 
  if we 'd known we 'd have withdrawn , and that would make things far too obvious for the international community . 
  man you got to love the mental gymnastics . 
  `` it 's only democratic for people to change their minds if they do it via referendum ! '', 
  `` okay , let 's have another referendum . '', 
  asking people if they 've changed their minds is undemocratic ! '', 
  if by `` very '' left leaning you mean `` slightly '' then yeah . 
  dutchbat was severely outnumbered and outgunned . 
  they were about 400 strong , facing a force of thousands that included heavy armor . 
  and the un mandate did not allow dutchbat to bring heavy weaponry ; so they were only lightly armed and incapable of dealing with the armor . 
  dutchbat made urgent and repeated requests for air support but these were denied/cancelled for various reasons ( more recent investigations revealed that there was a [ secret pact ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/04/how-britain-and-us-abandoned-srebrenica-massacre-1995 ) between the us , uk , and france to let the enclaves fall in order to secure peace , which is why the air support was repeatedly denied ) without air support , there was little to nothing they could 've done . 
  they 'd have taken out some of the enemy , but at the cost of their own lives while the enclave would still have fallen and the massacre would still have taken place . 
  that certainly takes away my issues with the title in the op . 
  there 's a huge difference by pointing out that the high fertility rate is a challenge that has to be overcome , and claiming that africa has problems because they 're having too many kids . 
  it 's not the truth though . 
  there 's only two countries in africa that fit that description . 
  burundi with an average fertility rate of 7-8 children per woman born , and niger at 6-7 . 
  this is hardly surprising given they consistently rate among the five poorest countries in the world . 
  now you can argue that there 's plenty of other countries in africa where the figure is 4-5 or 5-6 ; but that still would n't address the fact that there 's a well established link between poverty and fertility rates . 
  it 's not a `` civilizational '' problem . 
  7-8 children born to a woman used to be the norm in the west during the 19th century . 
  these type of fertility rates are a symptom , not a cause , of problems ; problems caused by poverty and unequal access to healthcare and education . 
  look at it like this : they 're trying to portray the english as a dangerous enemy we need to join the nazi 's in fighting . 
  using the 2nd anglo-dutch war for that just does n't make sense in that light . 
  it was just a war started over trade . 
  the 1673 date makes a lot more sense to us ; because it was preceded by 1672 , a year we still today refer to as the rampjaar : year of disaster ; getting attacked by no less than 4 countries at the same time . 
  and we still managed to win . 
  so in one it 's just an england that attacks us because we make too much money and we fight back . 
  we had an epic victory , but meh . 
  in the other , it 's england being an asshole and joining 3 other assholes in trying to utterly eradicate us . 
  and we still get a victory . 
  it seems to fit the propaganda narrative more . 
  of course , if i were running a counter-propaganda effort , i 'd point out that two of the 4 states that invaded us were part of modern day germany . 
  as someone else pointed out , that 's not the waddensea but the ijsselmeer ; which itself used to be a sea called the zuyderzee until we dammed it off ( and then drained parts of it for land ) . 
  as for shallowness ; it depends on what you 'd consider ` shallow ' i suppose . 
  the ijsselmeer has an average depth of around 5,5 meters , with a deepest point of around 7 meters . 
  the waddenzee 's depth by comparison varies wildly depending on time and place , but the deepest point is around 45 meters . 
  i ca n't keep staring at his pants . 
  those are some seriously ill-fitting pants . 
  that 's because g20 meetings include invited guests and heads of international organizations . 
  guest nations this time around are the netherlands and spain ( both part of the 20 largest economies in the world , but for various reasons not part of the g20 ) , as well as singapore , norway , senegal , guinea and vietnam . 
  in addition to them , there 's leaders of the world bank , imf , fsb , un , wto , oecd , world health organization , food & agriculture organization , and the international labor organization . 
  almost any world leader except for the likes of trump has better style than putin ; who comes across as needlessly confrontational in any sort of encounter with western media . 
  what 's likely intended as a way to project a strong image instead comes across as whiny and insecure . 
  definitely * not * cool . 
  compare that to leaders like merkel or abe , who are * literally * ` cool ' in the way they approach other leaders , not letting petty shit get to them and focusing instead on diplomacy and governance . 
  that 's * real * style . 
  the kind of style a leader needs . 
   the interesting thing is that the netherlands was never ` reclaimed ' from the sea . 
  excuse me , but i happen to live in the part of the netherlands that * was * in fact reclaimed from the sea . 
  nothing . 
  the constant pumping is of groundwater ( sub-surface water ) ; which is necessary to keep some parts of the country dry . 
  this also creates the problem of having those areas sink a little every year , necessitating us to pump more and more groundwater out . 
  groundwater levels will restore themselves continually unfortunately , meaning we 're never really done with the pumping . 
  but it 's not like if we stop pumping for a couple of hours ( or even days ) everything 's suddenly under water . 
  it does n't become a problem quick enough for that afaik . 
   i was just saying that a coin-flip is not binary everyone understands that the coin-flip is a binary proposition when used as a hypothetical in an argument . 
  to counter that by pointing to the real-world possibility of a coin landing on its edge ( which is so incredibly unlikely as to be a non-factor in practice ) is what 's called clutching at straws . 
   atheism is the lack of belief . 
  nontheism is the lack of espoused belief . 
  that 's not the same . 
  yes . 
  that is ** exactly the fucking same thing ** unless you 're trying to differentiate by claiming that the nontheist could be ** lying ** about it . 
   you do n't lack the belief that it 's going to win but you have n't made up your mind yet . 
  this does not differentiate atheism and nontheism . 
  neither is a case of `` having made up your mind . '', 
   your coin metaphor is a very poor one because flipping a coin is not a binary option . 
  the coin can very well land on its side like this . 
  this has got to be the most clutching-at-straws argument i 've ever seen . 
   agnostics believe not that the coin will land on either side but that it 's a coinflip that 'll never be resolved * which is the exact same fucking thing as not believing it has landed on a given side * . 
  so in that case you 're an atheist by default . 
  i hate to burst your `` i 'm occupying the middle-ground '' bubble , but there really is * no * way around this . 
  you still either believe in god or you do n't . 
  you ca n't change this fact by claiming the answer is unknowable ; doing that * can only ever qualify your atheism or theism , nothing more and nothing less * . 
   he ( re ) is the difference between atheism and nontheism : that is not a difference at all . 
  they 're both the absence of belief in god . 
  just worded differently . 
   no , pure agnosticism is excactly inbetween no . 
  it 's not . 
  agnosticism is a qualifier . 
  nothing more . 
   if you say that both god 's existence and his nonexistence are excactly as likely , then that 's no lack of belief , then you believe in neither his existence nor his nonexistence . 
  no , you seem to not understand the point . 
  it does n't matter if you say that both are just as likely . 
  you still either believe ... or you do n't . 
  god 's existence is a binary proposition , and so too then is your belief or lack thereof .
