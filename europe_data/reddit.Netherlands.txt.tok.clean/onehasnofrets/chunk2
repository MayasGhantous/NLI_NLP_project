  say in some county , that 's 90 % of the market . 
  then obviously , everything else they do has to increase 10-fold . 
  ten times more wind , ten times more solar , ten times more biogas , ect . 
  doing that without including nuclear is just making it unnecessarily hard . 
  you said :  that the tohoku earth quake was the strongest to ever hit japan is completely irrelevant because safety engineering does n't work that way . 
  the discrepancy in death tolls comes from the double standard in regulations applied to nuclear reactors and everything else . 
  i say it 's relevant , because i explained that it is how safety engineering works when adapting existing structures . 
  it is completely unrealistic to imagine this kind of catastrophe having no negative effects at all . 
  it 's better to prevent 10 deaths than to prevent 1 . 
  so the question becomes , what prevention will have the most effect ? 
  my answer from looking at the numbers : it 's not going to be nuclear reactors that need tighter regulations . 
  because what they say is true in european countries . 
  england , france , germany , india and canada have had 0 nuclear casualties . 
  usa in the last 10 years has had one , a uranium miner died when a support beam collapsed . 
  japan has had 7 from legitimate accidents . 
  this should tell you something about the nuclear industry in japan , not about all kinds of nuclear reactors forever . 
  you 're also ignoring the data from all the nuclear reactors who do run well , and all the other types of power generation which are prone to accidents . 
  it 's actually similar to airlines and cars . 
  just because airline crashes make the news more than car crashes does n't mean cars are safer than airlines . 
  if you do the math , you 'll find out it 's the opposite . 
  i find normal people are quite capable of doing this , so long as they are given the time to think . 
  compare nuclear for example to wind . 
  wind turbines kill 14 people per year in england , mostly maintenance accidents . 
  why are n't you banging on the doors of the wind-industrial complex ? 
  `` oh , that 's mostly poor people anyway ? '', 
  or take the coal plants that are now being built to replace nuclear . 
  in the england , coal kills 3000 . 
  that 's from pollution mostly , which the public foots the bill for via healthcare . 
  that 's why coal is so cheap . 
  no matter how much you value a human life at , i 'll take the combined cost of all nuclear accidents ever over that . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2013/09/29/forget-eagle-deaths-wind-turbines-kill-humans ) not to mention that nuclear is does n't put out co2 , so it 's safer in a climate change sense . 
  or that it takes up hardly any area compared to solar/wind , meaning less bulldozing of nature . 
  or that it 's a source of energy with the potential to increase humanity 's access to energy by a factor of millions , given the energy density of fissile material and it 's abundance . 
  a source like that should be given all the chances it needs to develop . 
  the short answer is called hastelloy n. for a long answer , i recommend [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knofnx7hcbg&amp;list=plkfir74hxwhpsaxsrcy--oraxxbxdwnxk ) video which focuses on the technical issues with the molten salt reactor experiment at oakridge . 
  my point is that many buildings in japan , including other forms of power generation , were not safe enough to withstand this size of earthquake without casualties , while the fukushima daiichi plant was safe enough to survive it without causing casualties , even if it went through meltdown . 
  when you spend for safety there is no 100 % , that 's not how risk works . 
  there 's also the diminishing returns factor where each hundreth of a percent will cost you more than the previous to ensure . 
  my point is that even though daiichi 's problems could have been easily prevented , there are countless other ways that money could have been spent in preparing for the same disaster that would actually have saved lives . 
   nuclear power is not fought against because some hippies in woolen shirts are too irrational , but because nuclear engineers have failed at creating nuclear power technology that can be profitably operated by profit-driven companies with an acceptable or even quantifiable amount of risk oh , that 's just not true . 
  i advise you to look into gen iv reactors , all with an impressive level of safety . 
  the reason they never made it , is because [ ecoterrorists fire rockets at them ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superph%c3%a9nix ) . 
  all nuclear research is dependent on political support and decisions . 
  those reactors are routinely killed to gather green votes , while pointing to minor technical problems . 
   with an acceptable or even quantifiable amount of risk so you admit that your idea of the risk of nuclear reactors is ( 1 ) not acceptable ( 2 ) not quantifiable ? 
  so it 's based on your emotional reactor to the word ` radiation ' ? 
  i say i 'm going to side with the experts on this one , and give a passing look at the body count from maintenance on wind turbines . 
  if that 's acceptable , so 's nuclear . 
   seismologic knowledge was available that allowed for the prediction of a fukushima-like catastrophe at least ten years before it happened , most probably far earlier . 
  had the regulatory bodies worked properly , the fukushima daiichi plant most probably would n't have been built , and it would definitely have been shut down forcefully long ago . 
  some perspective here from [ 2011 t\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami wikipedia page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_t%c5%8dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami )  on 10 february 2014 , a japanese national police agency report confirmed 15,884 deaths , [ 23 ] 6,148 injured , [ 24 ] and 2,633 people missing [ 25 ] across twenty prefectures , as well as 127,290 buildings totally collapsed , with a further 272,788 buildings ` half collapsed ' , and another 747,989 buildings partially damaged . 
  [ 26 ] the earthquake and tsunami also caused extensive and severe structural damage in north-eastern japan , including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas , and a dam collapse . 
  [ 18 ] [ 27 ] japanese prime minister naoto kan said , `` in the 65 years after the end of world war ii , this is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for japan . 
  '' [ 28 ] around 4.4 million households in northeastern japan were left without electricity and 1.5 million without water . 
  [ 29 ] now , how many people died from the nuclear meltdown ? 
  absolutely nobody . 
  really , should shutting down the fukushima daiichi plant have been the first priority to improve the earthquake and tsunami safety situation in japan ? 
  yeah , i think you 're right . 
  just to clarify a little demographic theory : in a pre-industrial society , birth rates and death rates are high . 
  having enough children to continue the farm is both a challenge and a necessity . 
  in an industrial society , death rates start to drop , but the birth rates remain high for some time as cultural norms abide . 
  the population skyrockets , and needs to be maintained with additional innovations , which leads to a further drop in death rates , ect . . 
  in a post-industrial society , the birth rates come in line with death rates or even dip below . 
  there are many theories as to why this shift happens , or why exceptions occur . 
  these include ( but are not limited to ) : consciousness of overcrowding , the availability of anti-conception , the socialization of the benefits of extra labor , the certainty that offspring will survive ; all these probably play a part . 
  fusion is probably something for the 22nd century . 
  fissile material just needs a neutron , and it needs to be handled well . 
  fusion needs very extreme conditions to work , like strong magnetic fields generated by superconductors cooled by liquid hydrogen kept right next to temperatures of the sun 's core . 
  we can have 100 phd 's with 15 billion dollars working on fusion for 25 years , and it still has n't been done . 
  we can get a couple high school grads two years of training and they can run a fission plant . 
  it 's that well understood . 
  if it would work it would be better though . 
  but an efficient , safe form of fission would already be a 1000 times better than fossil fuels , i say we make the big jump first . 
  well , biogas could be transported rather than burned on site for power . 
  plus , it 's carbon neutral . 
  also , methane can be synthesized by the [ sabatier process ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sabatier_process ) . 
  there 's apparently a [ facility ] ( http://www.zsw-bw.de/infoportal/presseinformationen/presse-detail/weltweit-groesste-power-to-gas-anlage-zur-methan-erzeugung-geht-in-betrieb.html ) in germany already . 
  i have now posted there too . 
  there was a highly up-voted discussion about alternative sources of energy and nuclear seemed a pretty popular option . 
  i figured i 'd give it a shot . 
  could n't agree with you more in general , though france has n't been successful innovating beyond the standard water cooled reactors . 
  which anyone can have some legitimate concerns about , even though by most measures it 's the safest form of energy right now . 
  what we really need is either something like their [ superph\u00e9nix ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superph%c3%a9nix ) plutonium breeder reactor , or a [ thorium based ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s9gcbeew5s&amp;list=plkfir74hxwhpsaxsrcy--oraxxbxdwnxk ) approach . 
  [ norway ] ( http://oilprice.com/latest-energy-news/world-news/norway-begin-testing-thorium-in-nuclear-reactors.html ) and india are dipping their toes in to test the water so to speak , but potentially thorium in an efficient reactor could be what fusion wanted to be . 
  if you 're interested in the history of the relation between religion and finance , i recommend * debt ; the first 5000 years * by david graeber . 
  short version : it 's a grand overview of many cultures and times , and he has a particular axe to grind as an anthropologist . 
  in the allegory of adam smith , before currency there was barter in the form of spot-transactions . 
  3 chickens for a cow . 
  he call this the myth of barter . 
  it turns out , that 's not what history shows . 
  rather , people have adopted a stunning diversity of credit systems , and that means many different ethical attitudes to debt . 
  anyway , on to islam . 
  i quote his examination of the economics of [ ghazali ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-ghazali\u200e ) ( 1058-1111 ) and [ tusi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nasir_al-din_al-tusi ) ( 1201-1274 )  ghazali 's take on the division of labor is similar [ to that of tusi ] , and his account of the origins of money is if anything even more revealing . 
  it begins with what looks much like the myth of barter , except that , like all middle eastern writers , he starts not with imaginary primitive tribesmen , but with strangers meeting in an imaginary marketplace . 
    sometimes a person needs what he does not own and he owns what he does not need . 
  for example , a person has saffron but needs a camel for transportation and one who owns a camel does not presently need that camel but he wants saffron . 
  thus , there is the need for an exchange . 
  however , for there to be an exchange , there must be a way to measure the two objects , for the camel-owner can not give the whole camel for a quantity of saffron . 
  there is no similarity between saffron and camel so that equal amount of that weight and form can be given . 
  likewise is the case of one who desires a house but owns some cloth or desires a slave but owns socks , or desires four but possesses a donkey .
