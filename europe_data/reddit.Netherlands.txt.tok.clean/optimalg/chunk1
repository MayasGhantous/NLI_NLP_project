well , i 've been searching for a bit , and found a [ paper ] ( http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/26074/1/greese_no_31.pdf ) about this exact thing . 
  turns out we 're both right . 
  * income underreporting is highest in the top decile ( top 10 % ) with 14,5 % underreported income ( and the top 1 % with a whopping 23,6 % of underreported income ) , but the lowest three deciles are evading taxes as well , with an average of about 10 % underreported income . 
  probably to put themselves just into the tax-free bracket . 
  * the total percentage of due taxes is about 26,1 % , or 2,06 billion euros less income tax a year . 
  * evasion has actually led to a higher income equality ( and , thus , a higher gini coefficient , probably because the tax evasion of higher incomes has more impact than that of the lower incomes ) , and has led to more poverty at the same time ( because the fact that there is more average disposable income has led to a higher poverty line , putting more people under that line ) . 
  upper and upper-middle class , however , have more resources to do so successfully . 
  access to foreign bank accounts , knowledge in bookkeeping ( and how to cook the books ) , better social networking , etcetera . 
  so that likely means it 's even higher than measured . 
  foreign relations between russia and the netherlands used to be excellent , a lot better than other eu nations , because of shared history and economic ties ( they like flowers a lot , we happen to have a lot of flowers ) . 
  until it deteriorated rapidly in 2013 ( ironically the `` netherlands-russia year '' , which was meant to highlight said excellent relations ) due to a string of diplomatic incidents . 
  mh17 was the absolute final blow though . 
  that guy 's job is to say things so outrageous that it makes putin look moderate in comparison . 
  barely works , but still . 
  i 've seen it used as a shorthand for arabic ( - looking ) people . 
  [ sikhs are getting harassed because they look like muslims ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11410809/sikhs-or-muslims-racists-dont-discriminate.html ) , which is proof that racism plays at least a partial role . 
  edit : what i 'm basically trying to say is that islam might not be a race , but it is being racialized . 
  it means that islam is being associated with certain outside traits , and that people are responding more to those exhibiting those traits than those that may be muslim but do n't `` look like them '' . 
  [ it 's happening to sikhs and hindus as well . 
  ] ( http://www.sfu.ca/iirp/documents/joshi%202006.pdf ), 
  germany does n't have a minimum wage for interns , and some employers do n't have to generally implement one yet . 
  songs in eurovision used to be required to be in the native language , but they abolished that rule after ireland won three consecutive times . 
  they then allegedly deliberately sent a poor entry to avoid winning a fourth time , only to win again the year after . 
  i collect banknotes . 
  getting european notes has become a bit harder as they are either old or from countries further away . 
  otherwise , no . 
  that 's because the value of the marka was fixed at the same value as the german mark . 
  well , the current reason for having to register before voting is to have some kind of mechanism that requires your electorate to be a bit more informed about politics before voting . 
  abolishment would take that incentive away , which * may * lead to less informed voters . 
  but now i can see that i phrased my post wrong , i 'm actually against the registration system they have in the us . 
  what i meant to say is that a high turnout does n't necessarily mean that a democracy is functioning well . 
  you should be allowed not to vote , in my opinion . 
  it 's a bad idea , but still . 
  what 's important is that the section of the population that does vote is representative to the population as a whole , i.e. 
  not skewed towards a certain age group , income bracket , ethnicity or political leaning . 
  if the us abolished the voter registration system , turnout would certainly be higher . 
  question is if you 'd actually want that . 
  it 's not necessarily a good thing for how a democracy is functioning . 
  never underestimate what can go wrong with voting . 
  there were around 20.000 invalid votes during the last dutch general election , and i ca n't see how that could ever happen unless you actively try to invalidate your vote . 
  to me , having to write your answer down just seems like a waste of time and effort ( not to mention that there probably will be jokesters who will write down vielleicht ) , so that 's why i was wondering if there was a reason for it . 
  maybe it 's to accommodate language differences ? 
  quick question : if ja and nein are the only options , why do you need to write them down instead of ticking a box ? 
  i foresee some problems with legibility or invalidation of more votes if it has to be written , so i was wondering if there was a specific reason to do it this way . 
  the netherlands has one case of retroactively altering a monument , in order for it to be a part of history without glorifying the darker sides of it . 
  there is a [ monument in amsterdam ] ( http://www.buitenbeeldinbeeld.nl/amsterdam_z/van_heutsz_bestanden/image001.jpg ) that was originally dedicated to general j. 
  b. van heutsz , governor-general of the dutch east-indies from 1904 till 1909 . 
  he was deemed a hero at the time for his leadership during a [ violent colonial war in aceh ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aceh_war ) , for which he later became controversial among communists , because of , you know , imperialism . 
  the sculptor of the monument , frits van hall , was a known communist , and probably because of this the design for the monument centered more around indonesian symbolism than van heutsz himself . 
  his [ bronze portrait ] ( http://resources21.kb.nl/gvn/iisg02/iisg02_30051001464020_w.jpg ) was [ vandalized ] ( http://fast.mediamatic.nl/f/ntrb/image/193/888-324-409.jpg ) a lot during the 20th century until it was removed in 2004 . 
  it 's been a monument to the dutch east-indies ever since . 
  yup . 
  imagine that , promoting integration instead of white genocide/eurabia conspiracies . 
  must be rotterdam . 
  [ according to unhcr , 53 % of all refugees arriving in europe by boat are syrian ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.html#_ga=1.78461334.325091383.1440523575 ) . 
  that 's why people are mostly talking about them . 
  it 's understandable , though . 
  you immediately have someone that is able and willing to support you . 
   the oberlandesgericht linz decided in 2014 , that fkp could not base its request on the nullity of the privatization/transformation , as that possibility had a term of limitation of 10 years according to the applicable law in russia ( if the term of limitation defense had been actively relied upon ) , and that thus fkp could not claim that spirits had not obtained the trademarks from the owner . 
  the luxembourgish company owns the trademark in austria , but they lost a lawsuit in the netherlands recently , which means that fkp ( the russian company ) will be selling stoli here from september onwards . 
   picture of prostitutes on de wallen i think i have some bad news for you regarding from what part of europe most of them come . 
  hint : it 's not the west . 
  stoli is a bit difficult . 
  there was a [ dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stolichnaya#trademark_ownership_and_production_rights ) between a russian state-owned company who produces vodka in kaliningrad , and a company from luxembourg who produces vodka under the same name in latvia . 
  so check who owns the brand in your country .

  edit : it 's been 0 days since reddit last referenced * in bruges * . 
  i wonder how many russian university students will magically fail their courses next semester . 
  nope , i think it only counts for book stores that participate . 
  the netherlands has something similar . 
  during ` book week ' , you get a free novel for each book purchase that week . 
  this free novel counts as a valid train ticket for one day during that week . 
  ever heard the swiss german dialect ? 
  it 's so far removed from standard german it might as well be another language . 
  muslims are being [ racialized ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racialization ) . 
  does n't matter if they actually are a race , they 're still treated as such by some . 
  that 's the point . 
  do n't hold referendums on [ nimby ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nimby ) decisions , because the results are obvious and not very productive . 
   `` it is plain then , by the practice of governments themselves , as well as by the law of right reason , that a child is born a subject of no country or government . 
  he is under his father 's tuition and authority , till he comes to age of discretion , then he is a freeman , at liberty what government he will put himself under , what body politic he will unite himself to ... . '' - john locke, 
  in other words : the income inequality ( the gini coefficient ) in greece is one of the highest in europe , and according to a finnish statistics bureau , it has the highest risk of poverty in the eurozone . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.stat.fi/til/tjt/2013/04/tjt_2013_04_2015-05-25_tie_001_en.html ) ( bear in mind that at the time of measuring , both latvia and lithuania had n't adopted the euro yet , so statistics of those countries may not be correct anymore . 
  i trust the other numbers , though ), 
  do n't tell that to the french , though .

  so ... why exactly did he do it ? 
  to test the security or something ? 
  yeah , [ i heard fidesz has a massive following in sz\u00e9kely land ] ( http://m.finugor.com/node/42222 ) .

  i have at least 20 keywords filtered in res for / r/europe alone , including every possible spelling of the word ` refugee ' and ` migrant ' , just to keep the sub bearable to browse and find threads i can comment in . 
  what 's the point in contributing to those discussions when all you get is downvotes and insults ? 
  we all know what happens when german politics * is n't * boring , you know .
