  `` how to recognize another / r/vexillology subscriber . '', 
  that 's what they 've been saying about russia and belarus for years now . 
  the old flag of serbia-montenegro was really just a tricolour . 
  also , serbia-montenegro does n't exist anymore . 
  did they ever manage to get that 1/8th of their gdp back ? 
  ( by the way , this is the first time i 've seen anyone other than dclauzel use emoji in reddit posts . ), 
  yeah , sure . 
  i 'd love to spread the gospel of stroopwafels . 
  [ apparently because of some deal that did n't include denmark ] ( http://astanatimes.com/2015/06/in-milan-nazarbayev-announces-extension-of-visa-free-regime-for-20-countries/ ) . 
  wikipedia page [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_finnish_citizens ) and [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_danish_citizens ), 
  is that just vat or excise as well ? 
  bosnia and albania ? 
  i 'm tempted to start a timeshare kind of thing now , actually . 
  i checked the prices , and [ holy shit ] ( http://ee24.com/search/?category=14&amp;price_max=&amp;distance=&amp;bedrooms_min=2&amp;price_min=&amp;square_max=&amp;location=309&amp;page=1&amp;square_min= ) . 
  i could actually buy some of those houses , and i 'm a student with next to no income . 
  edit : by the way , what 's the deal with the tacky wallpaper in every house ? 
  the year where the belgians got their asses handed to them and had to be bailed out by the french ? 
  yes please . 
  i guess the belgian standaard is comparable to nrc . 
  the netherlands had a de standaard as well . 
  it got banned after ww2 for being too pro-nazi in their reporting , and it was replaced by the resistance paper trouw . 
  of course you do n't get it . 
  your flag is upside down . 
  i might let it slide if t\u00fdr releases more albums . 
  japan has the death penalty . 
  not sure how it 's relevant to the outcome of this specific case . 
  still salty about the medway , i see . 
  i would n't be surprised if \\ / r/european has a pretty large contingent of americans who look at this continent from a heritage perspective . 
  dude , you 're american . 
  the fact you 're obsessed with heritage does n't mean you know about europe or its people . 
  stop pretending you do . 
  the association agreement , or rather the refusal of the last ukranian president to sign it , is the catalyst for why there is a war in the donbass in the first place . 
  so it 's related in a way . 
  it 's framed hard as a referendum ` against the eu ' . 
  the association treaty is used as a crutch to make a political point . 
  maybe replace ` banned ' with ` benned ' , and then also make it bilingual . 
  [ they got a new one . 
  ] ( http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/central/provo/celebrate-provo-has-an-official-city-flag/article_19a5dbaa-75e4-508d-a0fe-a30a802591bf.html ), 
  he got that nickname back when russia was n't as authoritarian as it is now . 
  [ does n't look particularly shopped to me , just bad compression . 
  oh , i agree . 
  i was mostly talking about the stylization of the shahada . 
  i agree that in this case they probably just bought the backpack because it has the shahada , it just struck me as weird that they did n't recognize the pretty sylized version of it . 
  i 'm not seeing christians using the [ kkk symbol ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/kkk.svg/480px-kkk.svg.png ) either . 
  a lot of those look really nice , i 'll try a few of them . 
  i 'd love to hear why they named this [ english soup ] ( http://www.originalitaly.it/it/ricette/r-zuppa-inglese ) as well . 
  well , hanlon 's razor does apply , but you 'd think people would know what the flag of isis looks like . 
  [ you get arrested . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/world/europe/germany-bans-support-of-isis.html?_r=1 ), 
  the czech republic , judging by his flair . 
  what i can recommend is [ belarus : the last european dictatorship ] ( http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300134353 ) by andrew wilson . 
  the title sounds a bit sensationalist , but it 's a great starting point . 
  [ peer-reviewed as well . 
  ] ( http://yalepress.yale.edu/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300134353 ), 
  well , i guess you can get equally drunk from all of them . 
  i 'm following a course about post-communist transitions , and i 've read a few books about how belarus was formed and how lukashenka came into power . 
  the big thing about belarus , is that it was never an independent state before the 1990s . 
  it had belonged to poland , lithuania and russia . 
  this meant that there was n't much of a national identity when it became independent : even now , russian is still a more popular language than belarusian . 
  when lukashenka came into power , he managed to construct a national identity around his person , which is why he 's nicknamed batka ( daddy ) . 
  i wo n't go as far as calling it a cult of personality , but he 's certainly a populist leader . 
  sure , it 's just a connotation that no one besides me will ever make . 
  if it was n't intentional , it 's at least something that should have been caught before it became part of a nationwide political campaign . 
  especially since it 's completely devoid of context . 
  that 's what happens when there is no spatial planning for 2 decades . 
  ah yes , the svp , the party that once campaigned with [ overtly racist posters ] ( http://www.nrc.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/svp2.jpg ) . 
  how popular are they right now ? 
  that 's sean connery . 
  it 's an english accent of a dutch accent , i guess . 
  i do n't think non-dutch people can really imitate our horribul dutsj eksunt very well . 
  how i understood it is that it sounds plastic and robotic , like calling them ` vrouwelijken ' . 
  i wonder how they managed to get a gig in north korea of all places . 
  of course you 're going to get a result like that , it 's a nimby decision . 
  you 'd get the same kinds of result if the vote was about a power plant or a garbage disposal facility . 
  be against it all you like , it does n't make a problem go away or a solution less necessary . 
  drilling turned out to damage many buildings , some to the point of near collapse . 
  lots of flooding as well . 
  nobody knows for sure who his mother is . 
  though it 's probably irina abelskaya , lukashenka 's personal doctor at the time . 
  you have n't seen the [ north-south line ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amsterdam_metro#north-south_line ) . 
  i checked the laws regarding the dutch royal family , they apparently have something similar . 
  no taxes on government funding ( which would be kind of silly ) , but they are taxable on capital gains and other assets unrelated to their function . 
  i 've read some more into it . 
  it 's not technically a tax , but a voluntary payment in lieu of taxes . 
  i guess it 's a better solution than in other monarchies . 
  also , i was not trying to `` bitch about your royal family '' , just pointing out a possible hypocrisy in this specific princess 's point of view . 
  edit : some clarity in the first sentence . 
  phrasing was all wrong . 
  is n't the royal family exempt from taxes ? 
  the former clown of european politics has an opinion . 
  moving on swiftly . 
  it 's mostly a trend in the randstad , i think . 
  not sure where you live , of course . 
  what was the saying again ? 
  did n't your government close the border with serbia , like , last week ? 
  that would have been a good moment to keep the military on standby . 
  just in case . 
  looking at the details of the book , i found it was 172 pages instead of 100 . 
  still ridiculous though . 
  anyway , it 's [ this one .
