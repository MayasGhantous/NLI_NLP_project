the germans have already invented this for us . 
  i like your enthusiasm , but it 's more like they 're forced to undo the bad choices they 've made . 
  the stages of [ that picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/acqq9mc.jpg ) : `` i 'm staring ... at ... hey , nice cleavage . '', 
  `` damn , those are some bad scars on her face ... '' `` man , that room looks like a dump . '', 
  `` i almost missed all that because of her cleavage . '', 
  the tax benefits i mentioned will go a long way in doing just that . 
  that 's the stick approach . 
  the carrot might be to force ~ ~ local ~ ~ national governments to auction off frequencies for less and/or provide subsidies or tax benefits for the telco 's . 
  i actually created the subreddit because / r/privacy has a strong us-focus and i felt there was room for a sub focused not on the us , but on the eu/europe . 
  like taenk said , he 's happy to have the alternative . 
  he 's not saying the us-focus of / r/privacy is bad . 
  western-europe has ( had ) a false sense of security . 
  in the netherlands our national intelligence agency warns businesses each year that they 're subject to economic espionage . 
  and each year the businesses ignore this . 
  somehow the debate only focused on the overblown threat of ` terrorism ' , and most of the measures implemented to combat this supposed threat were directed at citizens . 
  european intelligence agencies have circumvented their national laws by trading intel with the 5/9/x eyes community ; we 'll spy on your citizens if you 'll spy on ours . 
  with all this in mind , i do n't think german politicians are naive about spying . 
  i believe they 're feigning outrage to win the voters ' favor . 
  ( 2013 was an election year in germany . ), 
  i also believe they 're doing it because they can benefit from it . 
  the german proposal for a ` european internet ' , keeping data within the eu , creates an advantage for european intelligence agencies . 
  they wo n't have to try and fetch the data in transit or from american data-centers anymore . 
  it will all be stored right under their noses . 
  i do n't ( yet ) have an answer to your last question . 
    people have the right to have their personal data erased ( with public interest exceptions , so journalists can probably rest easy ) . 
  this includes data passed on to third parties . 
   that will be very difficult to execute . 
  especially when there are companies specializing in resale of customer data . 
  agreed . 
  if that were to become law , the transfer of data from one party to another would have to be communicated to a customer/user every single time . 
    people can object to being visibly profiled in a way that could discriminate against them on the basis of race , political beliefs , sexual orientation and so on , and the organizations processing their data must make sure this discrimination does n't occur . 
   well , good luck with that . 
  not gon na happen , sorry . 
  way too many ways to bypass that thing . 
  [ data redlining ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/03/redlining-for-the-21st-century/284235/ ) , as this is called , is going to be one hell of a problem for everyone . 
  black boxes who discriminate each and every one of us , based on available data . 
  if we 're not careful , we 'll have segregated societies , but not in any clearly visible way . 
  off topic : regular [ redlining ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/redlining ) is interesting as well . 
  regarding foreign intelligence agencies : if all this passes , the foreign agencies would have to ask european officials for permission to access eu citizen 's data , even if it 's on a non-eu company 's servers located outside the eu . 
  those fines will give national privacy watchdogs teeth . 
  i had hoped governments would 've been subject to similar fines when violating people 's privacy as well . 
  oh well , at least there 's been some major progress . 
  snowden 's revelations could n't have come at a better time for europeans . 
  i 've asked for / r/thenetherlands to be opened up . 
  i hope the mod will respond . 
  ** update ** / r/thenetherlands is now open for business | is nu open voor zaken , 
  reminds me of this :  ** dutch uncle **   ** noun ** _ sometimes offensive . _  a person who criticizes or reproves with unsparing severity and frankness . 
    _ ** origin : ** _  1820 -- 30   _ ** usage note ** _  because dutch is used here to describe someone manifesting the opposite of warm , affectionate , typically avuncular behavior , this term is sometimes perceived as insulting to or by the dutch . 
    [ sauce ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dutch%20uncle ), 
  that shows the distribution among people who are receiving welfare . 
  it does n't show what percentage they are of the total population of people with a nationality . 
  for all i know , 99 % of their countrymen are n't on welfare . 
  without context , this does n't tell me very much . 
  translation : of the 721 thousand adults who do not posess the dutch nationality and live in the netherlands , 11 percent is on welfare . 
  so 89 % do n't depend on welfare ? 
  that 's not bad at all  especially if you consider that in the netherlands people are eligible for welfare even when employed . 
  if their income is n't sufficient , they get ` topped up ' to just below the ` social minimum ' income . 
  furthermore , receiving welfare is a temporary situation . 
  when you are on welfare , your municipal government forces you to apply for jobs , acquire skills , etc. 
  if you do n't , you lose your welfare . 
  exactly . 
  having more kids is a long term answer , and does n't solve anything right now . 
  letting refugees in is a short term answer , which solves several problems right now . 
  that 's the pragmatic argument . 
  we should find a way to take the smugglers out of the equation , and make sure that people who do attempt to cross the mediterranean can do so without dying en masse . 
  if we do n't , we 're complicit in their deaths . 
  personally , i feel we have the obligation to take in refugees coming from the middle-east . 
  it 's the human thing to do . 
  many europeans or their ancestors were refugees themselves at one point or another , and we never know when we might be again . 
  we might need to flee from war , or from climate-related problems . 
  then there 's the argument that we , in the west , are in part to blame for the clusterfuck in the middle-east . 
  yup . 
  both the economist and foreign policy ran pieces with this argument . 
  they proposed to open the gates and bring the refugees in so they can become contributing members of society , making the burden of aging lighter by sharing it with then newcomers . 
  and many of them are willing to take the jobs native europeans wo n't .

  can we keep room for all opinions , please ? 
  consider voting based on quality of content , not opinions . 
  you saying it 's more realistic does n't mean anything . 
  even if that dated information is correct , it does n't show rapid , recent growth , like you claimed in your previous comment . 
  it ca n't , because it 's at least seven years old . 
  wrong . 
  the level of people who believe in islam was at its highest in the mid-90s . 
  it dipped in the early 00s and is now higher but still below the peak in the 90s . 
  ( see fig . 
  a gay friend of mind said he kept hearing how people had stopped holding hands and stuff like that in public over the past few years because the harassment they endured got worse and worse . 
  took me by surprise . 
  i had n't expected our city to change that much in such a way in just a few years . 
   and now there is a new law proposal that allows the dutch general intelligence , security service and military intelligence agencies to mass survey and wiretap innocent civilians . 
   was already so . 
  also this law is under heavy fire from the opposition . 
  that together with a minority kabinet , wait till it 's enacted or declined . 
  you 're wrong on this one . 
  the aivd and mivd currently only have the ability to indiscriminately tap radio transmissions . 
  as most of the data in the netherlands now flows through underground cables , they are seeking - and will be granted - the powers to perform indiscriminate surveillance on cable-bound traffic . 
  in practice , this means they will gain access to the internet and voip traffic of dutch citizens and businesses . 
  that 's not good . 
  perhaps they 've only included meps who are n't already pro net neutrality ? 
  you clearly do n't understand net neutrality . 
  i 'll give you an example : a site like reddit would n't exist if there had been no net neutrality .
