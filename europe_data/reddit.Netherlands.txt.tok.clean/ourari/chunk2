  reddit would n't have been able to pay the extra bandwidth fees , or the fees to get into the right ` package ' in its early days . 
  it would n't have been able to grow . 
  same goes for youtube , twitter , facebook , you name it . 
  this would override any national laws currently in place . 
  of course , member states are part of the process . 
  as far as i know dutch meps are fighting hard to keep the eu proposal in line with the current dutch law . 
  they do link to the documents in the [ trialogues explainer ] ( https://savetheinternet.eu/background/#trialogues ) : among them is this link : https://edri.org/net-neutrality-primary-document-source/, 
  the previous phase in drafting this legislation ended [ surprisingly well ] ( https://www.laquadrature.net/en/net-neutrality-a-great-step-forward-for-the-free-internet ) . 
  it showed that there is significant support for proper nn protections . 
  it 's up to us to remind our meps that we 'd like them to steer things back on course . 
  more information : https://edri.org/european-citizens-stand-up-to-save-the-internet/, 
  yet again we see that there is not a need for more surveillance , but a need to make better use of the powers our governments already have . 
  europe ? 
  maybe . 
  / r/europe ? 
  could very well be the case . 
  ars article on the same case : http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/03/uk-cops-tell-suspect-to-hand-over-crypto-keys-in-us-hacking-case/, 
  even the belgian government itself admits that the problem lies with neglect : http://bigstory.ap.org/urn:publicid:ap.org:d653f6711c0a45db88cb46fa9c520613, 
  no , you are making it seem like nothing has been done or is being done , and that the only way to ever be safe from terrorism is mass surveillance . 
  we already have police , we already have intelligence agencies . 
  like i said , the problem lies with properly using the powers they already have . 
  in this case , a belgian civil servant in turkey left a file on his desk for too long . 
  paris and brussels have only installed liaison officers after the last paris attacks . 
  just two examples of many . 
  awarding them more powers will not be a fix for this issue , and mass surveillance ( as opposed to targeted surveillance ) [ does n't work ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/nsa-program-stopped-no-terror-attacks-says-white-house-panel-f2d11783588 ) . 
  and awarding these powers comes with great risk . 
  if we give up our protections from the state , like the right to privacy , we will never be safe from that state . 
  they may/will become a far greater threat than these few bomb-making punks could ever hope to be . 
  others try to use that same fear caused by these terrorists and fan the flame . 
  politicians use it to create a platform for plans that would be unacceptable in less fearful times . 
  the patriot act is one such example ; it was already written , waiting in drawer , and rushed through congress before congressmen and senators could even read it by exploiting their and the public 's fear after 9/11 . 
  media use that same fear to attract viewers and readers , which in turn attracts advertisers . 
  and many individuals use it on social media to get upvotes , likes , retweets , followers , etc. 
  the reach of media and social media is unprecedented , and it makes it seem like the threat is greater than it 's ever been , while it 's not . 
  this threat these men pose is n't extraordinary , and these are not extraordinary times ; there are fewer attacks and [ victims ] ( https://www.statista.com/chart/4093/people-killed-by-terrorist-attacks-in-western-europe-since-1970/ ) in europe now than there were in the previous [ 40 + years ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l9uvrlm.png ) . 
  we dealt with it then , we can deal with it now . 
  as for these terrorists , bombs and bullets are not their primary weapon . 
  fear is their primary weapon . 
  ( the ` terror ' in terrorism . ), 
  the violence is just a means of creating and spreading fear . 
  in this case , their attack has weaponized * you * ; you are now acting out of fear , and spreading that fear around . 
  whether you want it or not , by letting your fears guide you and influence your judgement , you are aiding the terrorists . 
  they ca n't divide us , they ca n't destabilize our governments , our very societies , in any other way ; they do n't have the numbers or the means to do it . 
  the only way they can attain their goals , is if we let them by giving in to fear . 
  this has nothing at all to do with offending or not offending people . 
  this has everything to do with democracy , everything to do with rule of law . 
  this is about freedom . 
   `` i learned that courage was not the absence of fear , but the triumph over it . 
  the brave man is not he who does not feel afraid , but he who conquers that fear . '' -- nelson mandela be brave . 
  calm down . 
  you 're still very safe . 
  both crime and terror attacks occur less frequently than in the previous century in europe . 
  the belgian government has trouble sharing the data they already have , and acting on that data . 
  giving them more while eroding our fundamental human and civil rights will not help us , but it will make us less safe . 
  good question . 
  this is just off the top of my head : for homegrown terrorism : - local police ( who have ties with  - community leaders , social workers , schools , residents , etc. 
  for the outsider threat : - communication with foreign governments and their services and some form of pattern recognition on travel records ( pnr & anpr ) , bank records , and communication records . 
  only allowing a detailed view after the grounds for suspicion of specific individuals has been reviewed by a judge - especially when it concerns your own citizens ) . 
  this could be considered a form of mass surveillance , i know , which is why there should be additional safeguards and limited access . 
  a perfect solution does not exist . 
  an open , democratic society , and respect for human and civil rights , brings with it unavoidable risk . 
  the number of attacks and victims of terrorist attacks [ ( 1 ) ] ( https://www.statista.com/chart/4093/people-killed-by-terrorist-attacks-in-western-europe-since-1970/ ) [ ( 2 ) ] ( https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rise-of-religiously-inspired-terrorism-in-france/ ) are still far lower than they were in the 70s and 80s of the previous century . 
  we should n't let ( social ) media and politics bully us into believing these are extraordinary times calling for extraordinary measures . 
  reasonable and proportionate = targeted surveillance . 
  i 've only ever seen it on amazon u.s. 
  and if you can understand dutch/flemmish , give this a read : http://www.tommelein.com/bezint-eer-ge-weer-een-databank-begint/, 
  no , just someone who cares about his privacy . 
  i 'm old enough to remember what it is like to live an untracked life . 
  private stuff . 
  just like cashless payment options , i use a phone . 
  i just do n't carry it everywhere , or i put it in a faraday pouch ( aka off-pocket ) when i want to be private . 
  shame is n't the only reason why people require privacy . 
  security is another reason . 
  being an anonymous source / source protection in journalism is another . 
  whistle-blowing . 
  and for people who live public lives , like politicians , they need to be able to have a private life as well . 
  diplomacy is another area where privacy is important . 
  for example , if everything happened out in the open , the relations between the u.s. and cuba would n't have been where they are now , with obama visiting havana today . 
  and this is just a small list . 
  the existence of a modern equivalent does not automatically make cash useless . 
  cashless payment alternatives have pros and cons , and so does cash . 
  some of those pros are or can be important enough to keep cash around . 
  you wo n't be forced to use it , but by keeping cash around you 'll have the option of making a private transaction . 
  privacy is about choice : which part of yourself you wish to expose or keep private when , and to/from whom . 
  you do n't * have * to use cash . 
  some of us would like to retain the option of private transactions , without hurting your cashless lifestyle . 
  lucky for you , you wo n't be forced to use cash . 
  i do n't have anything against cashless payments , and i use it as well . 
  i do have something against not having the option to pay with cash . 
  when i want something to remain private , like where i am , when , and for what purpose , i pay cash . 
  gift cards , probably . 
  the problem is that they have an expiration date , so you ca n't pass them around forever . 
  yup , and this time around the u.s. is going through the same motions . 
  they 're not going to help us , at least not in the right direction . 
  basically , they pull in the results from google and scrub the tracking stuff . 
  and they optimize their own site for privacy , with encryption and a proxy service , among other things .
