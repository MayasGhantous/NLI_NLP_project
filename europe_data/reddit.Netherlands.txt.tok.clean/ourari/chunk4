  http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-follow-up-to-the-european-parliament-resolution-of-12-march-2014-on-the-electronic-mass-surveillance.html there should be a public source somwhere , but i ca n't find it . 
  hmm , good question . 
  if legally possible , i would n't be surprised if they did add charges after successfully having him extradited to the u.s. 
  how is this suddenly okay if mine is not : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qpcgg/european_parliament_adopts_resolution_declaring/, 
  no , he is not facing a potential death sentence . 
   the criminal case against snowden , if proven , could lead to a prison term of at least 10 years and at most 30 years . 
  each of the three charges against him carry a maximum prison sentence of 10 years . 
  if convicted of each crime , snowden could get concurrent sentences , meaning he 's serve just a decade in prison . 
    if convicted of all three , he could also be sentenced to successive sentences , meaning he 's be locked up for three decades . 
  source : http://uspolitics.about.com/od/antiterrorism/a/the-criminal-case-against-edward-snowden.htm i should add that in the early days of this saga , this story ran on buzzfeed : [ america 's spies want edward snowden dead ] ( http://www.buzzfeed.com/bennyjohnson/americas-spies-want-edward-snowden-dead ), 
  agreed . 
  the meps did call for protection against extradition or rendition , but it remains to be seen if member states will indeed heed this call . 
  as for the title , in the interest of getting this news out there in this sub , i dare not change anything , even if for the better . 
  the mods saw fit in all their wisdom to remove a post with the primary source with a direct quote in the title for ` editorialization ' , so i went and found the only secondary source currently available . 
  if you wish to avail yourself of the primary source , please follow this link : http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20151022ipr98818/html/mass-surveillance-eu-citizens%27-rights-still-in-danger-says-parliament, 
  fine , hide behind the rules and ignore journalism altogether . 
  it is the primary source for that news , and it is one of the decisions they voted on , and arguably the most newsworthy one . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  that is a direct quote !, 
  because we allow for certain freedoms . 
  you do n't have to identify yourself in public , you do n't have to show what 's in your bag , you do n't have to go through checkpoints to reach certain parts of a city , we do n't have military personnel deployed on our streets . 
  this is just a short list of the many reasons why an attacker with , let 's say , a bomb vest , can walk around freely and toward his target . 
  if did have all those things , we 'd stop being an open and free society . 
  in both cases politicians ( and the public for that matter ) should react in a responsible manner . 
  terrorism , or any other threat to society , does not relieve them of their responsibility to defend and protect human rights like privacy and democratic society as whole . 
  an open and democratic society is almost by its very definition vulnerable to attack . 
  violence , or the threat of violence , is not a reason to start on a path that leads to the destruction of that very society . 
  if the main reason to do this is the reason you described , the terrorists are already winning by using their primary weapon . 
  and that weapon is fear , not bombs . 
  you left  things improved . 
  better translation :  focusing on the two attacks perpetrated by asylum seekers in bavaria merkel said assailants who used their time in germany to plan and launch attacks `` shamed the country that welcomed them . '', 
  merkel added : `` it makes a mockery of the aid workers who have offered help and it makes a mockery of other refugees who truly are seeking safety from violence and war , '' she said .

  that and germany has a negative population growth . 
  they need immigrants to offset people retiring and dying . 
  that explains the downvotes ; if it 's not on the front page , it 's not reality , right ? 
  you would probably be better off using a search engine to find information in your native language , as it 's not an easy subject . 
  this information is in english , but it might help you to understand what net neutrality is and why it matters : - https://www.savetheinternet.eu/en/faq/#what-is-net-neutrality - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p90mct24z6w - http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/understanding-net-neutrality.html, 
  could you be more specific ? 
  do you want to know what net neutrality is ?

  i kinda do , although the feeling is more related to its limited size than the population density . 
  i 've hiked for days without seeing much sign of civilization in the uk . 
  here you find ( perfectly designed , well-kept , and clean ) bike paths , roads , villages , etc. 
  within a few hours walk in any direction . 
  and that 's also what has spoiled me : the design and level of quality of public infrastructure is generally high . 
  going to almost any other country means settling for less . 
  resubmitted because the actual title assumes that ` renditioning ' can be ` rightful ' . 
  good point . 
   they who ? 
  [ this is what i could find ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/privacy-shield-agreement-signed-off-despite-vote-abstentions/ ) :  the commission has vowed to review the new deal once every year . 
   one diplomat said the countries that abstained from the vote would be `` extremely vigilant '' during the review . 
   `` this is not just going to be a box-ticking exercise , this is going to be a very detailed and in-depth review . 
  only adjustments from the review can save this from the ecj , '' the diplomat said . 
  it appears they 're very skeptical of the new agreement . 
  i do n't know the greater why , and i hope someone will take the time to explain it . 
  what i do know is that this agreement only needs the go-ahead from the eu member states . 
  any resolution by the european parliament would be non-binding . 
  and they have done just that . 
  you can find the resolution [ here ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?type=motion&amp;reference=p8-rc-2016-0623&amp;language=en ) and the press release [ here ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160524ipr28820/eu-us-%e2%80%9cprivacy-shield%e2%80%9d-for-data-transfers-further-improvements-needed-meps-say ) . 
  this offers some explanation , but it does n't answer your question : https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/meps-battle-to-get-their-vote-on-privacy-shield/, 
  i 'm disappointed this has gathered so few votes in / r/europe . 
  thankfully / r/technology picked up the slack . 
  try firefox for android or ios . 
  it supports plug-ins like ublock origin and https everywhere . 
  safer browsing with fewer annoyances , 
  from what i 've learned , the cost of living is high in switzerland . 
  i do n't know how to judge the amount , as i believe the cost of living to be considerably lower in the netherlands . 
  it would probably have a positive effect on population health and crime rates , further increasing the savings and/or the budget for bi . 
  - less restrictions than current benefits means people can take any job they want without fear of losing their benefits when they still need them - you forget about the basic in basic income . 
  bi may be enough to live off of if your rent is low and you only spend it on food . 
  you will still need to work to be able to afford for any luxuries . 
  plus in some countries there 's a strict repressive regime for those who receive benefits . 
  in the name of combating fraud , the system and rules have become so byzantine that doing anything but sitting still may cause you to lose ( part of ) your benefits . 
  it effectively kills any incentive to change their situation , even if they can . 
  no , i choose not to discuss with people who approach me with disrespect . 
  it tells me that any disucussion with them would prove to be a waste of time and energy . 
  i 'd rather engage in discussion with people who show some respect for other people 's opinions . 
  i actually already have a fair amount of 'em in my neighborhood . 
  some incidents among refugees , which are understandable when you 're stuck with strangers , with little privacy and little to do . 
  no incidents whatsoever between them and the locals , even though they do venture out . 
  turkey ca n't take all of them . 
  and now that a refugee camp in the region has been bombed , we 're going to see more fleeing in our direction . 
  save them from drowning , from bombing , etc. 
  i do n't agree that that 's exactly what happened , but insofar as it did , i agree that we should n't have . 
  member states have refused to form a unified response for years . 
  some have actively sabotaged an eu response . 
  they 've created the situation where it became unmanageable and proceeded to blame eu for it , while it was a crisis of their own creation . 
  had they acted responsibly , we would have had proper border protections on the union 's outer borders , and we would have put a stop to the people drowning sooner . 
  i 'm not saying we should just let them all walk in without vetting them , but i do believe we should provide help for those who need it . 
  we 're legally and morally bound to provide safe haven for refugees . 
  standing by and doing nothing while they drown in our backyard is not an option , imo . 
  if you think terrorism is a problem now , wait until you see the future after we did n't help them when we could . 
  i know . 
  does that mean we should n't save 1.1 million people and counting ? 
  ah yes , you know nothing about me , yet you choose to call me `` you people '' . 
  dozens ... out of how many ? 
  1.1 million in 2015 ?
