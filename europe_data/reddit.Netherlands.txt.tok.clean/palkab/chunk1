i keep forgetting how super dutch our snack walls are . 
  but does he run through fields of wheat ? 
  with mayonnaise, 
  stroopwafels filled with cheese and herring . 
  i feel much more european than dutch , really . 
  have fun in there , asshole, 
  because prosperity , comfort and information ( das interwebs ) are the best antidotes to religion . 
  thanks , something to look up in detail !, 
  where else as well ? 
  my news consumption is a bit western centric . 
  if only there was more time ... 
  oh yes definitely , proportional response to proportional threats . 
  what worries me is that this skewed reporting creates a lot of fear and globally directed hatred . 
  that is dangerous feeding ground for extremist views , as history has shown again and again , as well as the us has now demonstrated . 
  europe flirted with it in many countries in the recent election cycle as well . 
  the main risk , if you ask me , is polarization of political agendas . 
  after all , talking up to popular opinion means votes . 
  those politicians elected mainly because of populist agendas now show how incapable they are . 
  this damages the countries and their population waaay more than a few - very very tragic mind you - casualties of a religious nutter . 
  anyho , we do need to stay sharp on terror and improve the existing agencies to fight it, 
  media blows it way out of proportion though . 
  they report extremist killings but not the vast majority of non-religious killings that happen every day . 
  skews public perception, 
  be sure to get filthily rich first by selling arms and ~ ~ lending out to both sides of the conflict ~ ~ supporting both dev teams, 
  this . 
  guy does his homework and knows how to balance the large scale and human perspective of it all .

  aw neiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin : <, 
  and one balloon, 
  why are we not flooded then ? 
  sad these children pay the price for their parent 's idiocy, 
  `` where are the wheat fields ? '', 
  - theresa may, 
  `` where are the wheat fields ? '', 
  - theresa may, 
  just tie them to a windmill for a few hours in heavy wind . 
  extreme is extreme . 
  you do n't do this shit , ever, 
  `` wait what my side won ? 
  i 'm retiring kthxbai '', 
  alternative patriotism, 
  you 've reached the voc interplanetary department , how can i help you ? 
   `` this is all so confusing '', 
  as is tradition , of course . 
  of course , and we should do everything to combat the horrible organisation daesh/isis/whatevertheycallthemselvesnow at every turn . 
  i do n't believe we should judge all of islam for this . 
  however , i 'm not giving these extremists and what they do in other areas of the world a free pass , nor do i condone what they do . 
  i was pointing out * the risks in europe * and the resulting generalisations people hold towards entire groups of people , as a result of a perceived threat of immigration * into europe * . 
  in this sense it makes sense to limit at what data you look . 
  it has nothing to do with euro-centrism but with the scope of the present discussion . 
  similar comparisons could be made for other parts of the world when discussing the risks there , but again you need to limit the scope of the data you look at to prevent meaningless comparisons . 
  the discussion was on merkel & co inviting limitless terror , which is in europe , so it makes sense to contrast with other statistics from the same area . . 
  i 'm sorry you get triggered so easily , must be awesome for your health . 
  then the main issue is that there 's something going on in our society , that makes these 3rd and 4th gen turn to crime more than children of nationals . 
  i remember reading a quite interesting paper about this some time ago , i remember it was a more complex issue than the often `` aw they have social disadvantages so they turn to crime '' argument you hear a lot on the left . 
  i 'll see if i can find it . 
  edit : well that was quick . 
  [ here , link ] ( http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1477370815587768 ) . 
  hope it opens . 
  yes you 're right , let 's talk about the big issues . 
  let 's ** not ** use a statistically small threat to rationalize turning away thousands of people in need of help , when it 's unlikely that doing so will reduce said risk . 
  i 've linked below for the interested to read , i 'll link again here : [ 1 ] ( http://www.iss.europa.eu/uploads/media/alert_6_refugees_versus_terrorists.pdf ) , [ 2 ] ( http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/46604/rscas_2017_28.pdf?sequence=1 ) , [ 3 ] ( https://www.cato.org/blog/syrian-refugees-precationary-principle ), 
  it was n't meant as such . 
  the point was that the threat is non-proportional to the public response . 
  when presented with statistics about the actual impact of terror , i 've noticed many people lash out , mostly because terror has such a high salience . 
  it 's easy to imagine what it 's like to be a victim of a terror attack , and that 's terrifying to me as well . 
  i do n't want that . 
  however , odds are very low compared to other ( potentially nasty ) ways to go . 
  my perhaps ill-explained point was that this disjointedness between actual risk vs perceived risk fuels much of the negative attitudes towards immigration . 
  i 'm not convinced this is a positive thing , nor am i convinced that stopping immigration will lead to a reduction in terror incidents . 
  there 's no evidence for this , so why should we base opinion or political course on emotional valence ? 
  see for example [ 1 ] ( http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/46604/rscas_2017_28.pdf?sequence=1 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/46604/rscas_2017_28.pdf?sequence=1 ) , or a short one [ 3 ] ( https://www.cato.org/blog/syrian-refugees-precationary-principle ), 
  that is true , but daesh does n't even come near that success rate . 
  what i 'm saying is many people see terrorism as this huge threat , while in a statistical light that makes no sense . 
  thinking this way might help some people calm some nerves  . 
   who 've invited limitless terror horrible as the attacks are , in reality very few people are killed . 
  for example focusing on europe : compare the around 170 terror death toll in 2015 ( mainly due to paris attacks ) with the 25.500 death toll in traffic , or the 1.2 million something death toll due to cancer in 2014 ( most recent data i could find quickly ) . 
  but no , terror is the single greatest threat we have ever faced . . / s this is what daesh wants man . 
  they want you to feel they 're everywhere , threatening you at every turn , when in reality they 're nothing . 
  that bottle must have been an impasta though , makes me fiorious, 
  the legislation paper 's got the eu logo on it !! 1 !, 
  because all legislation that came from the eu is bad and must go . 
  / s who in their right minds could defend this ? 
  then again if uk 's crops stop being pollinated you might have to buy abroad , say from the eu . 
  then you would really to benefit from a free trade zone . 
  `` we will never pay this divorce bill , it 's outrageous ! '', 
  - every brexiteer policitian before yesterday . 
  i 'll be in the kitchen making some more popcorn . 
  nato is a mainly defensive alliance , not an invasion force . 
  this was refreshing and sharp , well worth the read !, 
  what have the liberal intelligentsia ever done for us ? 
  close , but you 're forgetting the `` place unreasonable amount of blame for all problems on a group of people or an institution '' part in that statement, 
  of course the link was a bit in jest given the content matter . 
  i read the article yesterday and have still to figure that one out . . 
  i would n't go to a university [ where i could n't study to become a genius ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/cambridge-university-sexism-row-genius-lecturers-students-a7787401.html ) , regardless of eu affiliation :') . 
  wait until they [ lift off ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/ironsky/images/d/d6/got.png/revision/latest?cb=20120716154109 ), 
  give it time, 
  why is that japanese magazine printed in french ? 
  i 'm game , where do we meet ?
