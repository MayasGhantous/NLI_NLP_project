that was not the point i was trying to make ... :p, 
  one of the sad things is that they picked one of the smallest players or so it seems . 
  there 's more people living in new york than in the whole of the netherlands . 
  we are in no position to act other than hope the un will give us some slack and help us financially to cope with this situation . 
  there is no evidence whatsoever . 
  that is the point i was trying to make . 
  does the us have the tech to determine who shot the missile ? 
  edit : i urge anyone interested into looking at / u/pladmir _ vutin posting history . 
  this account is only 4 months old and very much pushing a negative putin agenda . 
  please keep your heads on straight and keep with the truth . 
  are n't we hating russia enough already ? 
  do n't get me wrong though , a newfip operation made some confused people take down the wrong plane . 
  it 's all very sad . 
  :( edit : search that with quotes, 
  what are you calling me there buddy ? 
  but in all honesty , i think you are the one better of with financial stability , bankers housing bubble scam and prosperity wise :p stick to being a dutchman in germany , 
  i 'm afraid it 's too late !, 
   tenten - tentoonstelling i ca n't read that ... did n't you mean : hottentottentotempalententententoonstelling, 
  i think that the burgers at mcdonalds are very well thought through , very consistent quality and very well balanced in texture and taste . 
  it 's a bit uhm ... squishy i guess . 
  i do n't think you 'd really need teeth to eat anything from mcdonalds . 
  it depends where you get your fries from but again , although tiny , the fries are the best regarding crunch and ( again ) consistency in quality . 
  but i think the ones i make are better ( secret ingredient : bake them in duck fat ) . 
  i never `` enlarge '' the menu because all you get is the same size burger with a larger portion of fries and an amount of soft drink i 'll never finish . 
  so all in all , good stuff to eat maybe twice a year . 
  kfc is basically the hotwings bucket , the rest is bullshit on a stick and soft limpy fries . 
  i tried burgerking twice . 
  if you have 4 people in line/in front of you , better walk away . 
  it 's going to take at least 20 minutes before you can order and when you get your food you are at the 30 minutes mark . 
  they do make better burgers though . 
  thx for the feedback . 
  this post received several downvotes pretty fast and dropped from the frontpage of / r/europe this is n't really helpful so that 's when i edited the main text . 
  i do n't care about up or downvotes , i just want as much people as possible to see this question . 
  which is strange is n't it ? 
  but maybe there 's a french or italian website i have n't found out about that sells and ships products ( in consumer quantities ) to other european countries . 
  ( i so dearly hope this is the case ) thanks for helping me finding a solution , much appreciated , 
  i know about liquid smoke ( not readily available in the netherlands only if you look very hard : specialty stores ) . 
  the problem is that i 'm not looking for stuff that 's not available because regulations . 
  look [ here ] ( http://www.kikkoman.nl/industrie/producten/sojasaus-in-poedervorm/ ) ( it 's dutch , sorry about that ) . 
  what am i going to do with 25kg of that stuff ? 
  and about cooking with powders , i 'm more into creating novelty products for for instance people camping or hiking . 
  by the way , what are the sources that claim the positions on this map ? 
  thx for clarifying . 
  the colors do n't make sense . 
  the krim area is a known russian military deployed area , right ? 
  do n't you mean : dark red = areas of pro-russian militia activity light red = known major russian military deployments ? 
  because when it 's russia playing '' [ the game ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/cia-mi6-and-turkeys-rogue-game-in-syria-new-claims-say-ankara-worked-with-the-us-and-britain-to-smuggle-gaddafis-guns-to-rebel-groups-30183069.html ) '' it 's not fair . 
  right ? 
  the fuck are you talking about ? 
  it was 15 years ago . 
  we dutch did n't do great in that whole thing over there also . 
  shit happens and it was bad . 
  let 's get over it and with renewed knowledge start over again . 
  i know i can . 
  i 'd say f the usa . 
  europe should stand on it 's own legs and start acting mature . 
  what i see now is childsplay and anyone can run us over if they 'd like . 
  but i hear you . 
  the eu already proved to be a not very reliable institution by allowing the usa to meddle with ukraine . 
  edit : by the way ; good discussion , upvote for you , 
  1 ) there is no independent news organization in the netherlands . 
  all main stream media is operated in one way or the other by the government . 
  that said - and even though i have n't watched any televised news for over 2 years - i can safely say that 95 % of the dutch are anti russian and pro sanctions . 
  2 ) i am against sanctions because i noticed that america and the eu are either proactively engaged in the protests in ukraine ( `` f the eu '' ) or funded ( germany ) the protests . 
  why would we allow america to go to war in several countries ( and meddle with politics in other countries : egypt , syria et cetera ) and be outraged when russia steps in ( defends it 's critical positions having a harbor connecting it to the west ) ? 
  we can stand the economic fallout . 
  edit : a word, 
  i 'm starting to save money , this is brilliant . 
  maybe they are concerned a british mp ordered the data to be destroyed ? 
  you 'd think that would only happen in a [ banana republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banana_republic ) ... 
  mister morales just came from talks with putin . 
  i 'll bet they felt the need to shuffle some more onto the pile the us is currently getting itself into . 
  anyways , the bolivian airplane [ requested to land ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2ceamzfyoq ) because of some fuel indicator error . 
  a pilot told me this excuse is often used to do an unscheduled landing , sometimes they use the `` sick passenger '' trick . 
  you all just wait and see who 's the most wet when our dikes break ... * shakes fist *, 
  well , that was quick :( edit : that video wo n't load for me either but perhaps others can try . 
  thx for the notice uat2d . 
  ~ ~ footage also available on [ youtube here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=aya9ziwuycy ) . ~ ~ video removed :( edit : here 's other sources i found : [ dutch website ] ( http://www.telegraaf.nl/buitenland/21761314/__treinramp_spanje_gefilmd__.html ) , [ another dutch website ] ( http://www.zie.nl/video/algemeen/beelden-van-treinongeluk-in-spanje/m1nzjs4f883m ) , [ on liveleak.com ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=bca_1374749009 ) . 
  i do n't think the problems encountered in europe has a lot to do with being a muslim per se . 
  there are other religions too where people hold on to values and a way of living which are simply incompatible with the modern western world . 
  if you would have access to a time machine , traveled back to 1780 , picked some random european dude from the streets and go back to 2013 they 'd not only be shocked to see a modern world but also being utterly shocked by half naked women on billboards . 
  problematic kids are raised as if they are still living 200 maybe 300 years ago with values and views of a world back then . 
  in their native country they will be corrected on the streets by other parents and maybe an imam telling them to have respect not only for their [ grand ] parents but also for other peoples stuff . 
  in a western society children learn these values at home . 
  we do n't have a correctional society any more . 
  then there 's the language barrier , being raised in a family where dad brings home a tiny salary because he 's working a job that does n't involve language that much . 
  a dad that treats his wife in a way the western world frowns upon . 
  all these things bring forth very frustrated children , unhappy in their surroundings , willing to be rich but not getting the changes they feel they deserve . 
  it has taken hundreds of years for the western world to bend religion towards a more modern society . 
  we can not expect other religions to simply bend in a few decades when we ca n't even successfully reach those people and educate them . 
  i 'm just scratching the surface here but the far-right propaganda is way too simplistic and not at all helping in trying to solve a very difficult problem . 
  we need a european reddit and a european facebook/twitter asap . 
  and some euro-cloud like email service such as gmail would n't be too bad either . 
  and then connect the fuck out of each other ... communication is key . 
  maybe to clarify , from the audio it is cristal clear that the bolivian airplain requested to land because of some fuel indicator error . 
  a pilot told me this excuse is often used to do an unscheduled landing , sometimes they use the `` sick passenger '' trick . 
  here 's [ the audio ] ( http://dropbox.curry.com/shownotesarchive/2013/07/na-528-2013-07-07/assets/snowjob/fab001%20bullcrap%20about%20fuel.mp3 ) of the control tower and the bolivian airplane being * forced * down ... 
  here 's [ the same recording , easier to play ] ( http://audioboo.fm/boos/1482009-bolivia-air-force-fuerza-aerea-boliviana-fab001-flight-precaution-landing-vienna-austria ) , and a [ youtube longer version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2ceamzfyoq ) . 
  that makes more sense , thx !, 
  i 'm not sure i get it ... are they voting for if it has an `` impact on eu citizens ' privacy '' ?
