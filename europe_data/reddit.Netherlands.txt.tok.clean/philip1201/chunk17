  and arguably , in the same table , `` duldung ( z.b. 
  rejected asylum seekers ) ) . 
  112,754 and 11,962 crimes respectively , and 37 and 16 rapes . 
  legal asylum seekers are also listed in the table , as asylbewerber , with the same numbers of crimes as in table 61 . 
  it is clear from the table structure that they 're considered separate from both the above categories , and that their crimes are therefore also separate . 
  i have n't found good data on the number of illegals staying in germany . 
  if it 's any help , [ this table ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:countries_of_origin_of_ ( non-eu \\ ) _ asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states , _ 2013_and_2014_yb15_iii . png ) shows the origin country of registered asylum seekers in 2014 in the eu . 
  the demographics are comparable to estimates for 2015 , though syria is underrepresented . 
  i misremembered , it was 20 , not 30-40 . 
  i admit my german is n't very good , but i would swear `` asylbewerber '' refers to asylum seekers . 
  or maybe it 's my english that is n't very good , since i would swear `` foreigner with a residence permit '' does n't mean `` asylum seeker '' , a group generally categorised by * not having a residence permit * . 
  i 'm talking asylum seekers , not foreigners in general . 
  see the math in the [ edited original comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3s46o9/pepper_spray_almost_sold_out_demand_for_pepper/cwu02x9 ) . 
  though i did misremember , the number is 20 , not 30-40 . 
  learn to read : i said * asylum seekers * , not * foreigners * . 
  http://www.bka.de/de/publikationen/polizeilichekriminalstatistik/2014/2014standardtabellen/pks2014standardtabellentatverdaechtigeuebersicht.html , table 61 . 
  for rape and regular crime statistics among asylum seekers and the general population . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics for the number of asylum seekers . 
  google for the total population of germany . 
  if you look at the german statistics bureau 's publication for 2014 , asylum seekers are 10 times more likely to commit crimes and ** e : ** 20 times more likely to commit rapes . 
  since they 're now at 1 % of the population , rape will logically have increased by about ** e : ** 20 % and crime in general by 10 % , ceteris paribus , assuming the same percentage of asylum seeker criminals are convicted as average germans . 
  ** edit : ** sources and calculation : [ crime statistics , 2014 ] ( http://www.bka.de/de/publikationen/polizeilichekriminalstatistik/2014/2014standardtabellen/pks2014standardtabellentatverdaechtigeuebersicht.html ) , table 61 : all crimes : 2,149,504 all crimes by asylum seekers : 53,890 all rapes ( vergewaltigung ) : 765 +83 +450 = 1,298 rapes by asylum seekers : 40 +10 +12 = 62 [ number of refugees , 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:number_of_ ( non-eu \\ ) _ asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states , _ by_age_distribution , _ 2014 _ ( \u00b9 \\ ) _ yb15_iii . png ) : 202,645 [ german population , 2014 ] ( http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/germany-population/ ) : 82,652,256 assuming everyone is `` tatverd\u00e4chtige '' ( suspect ? ), 
  only once per year : percentage of germans who have been accused of crimes : 2,149,504 / 82,652,256 = 2.60 % percentage of asylum seekers who been accused of crimes : 53,890 / 202,645 = 26.6 % criminality of asylum seekers , relative to germans : 26.6 / 2.60 = 10.2 percentage of germans who have been accused of rapes : 1,298 / 82,652,256 = 0.00157 % percentage of asylum seekers who have been accused of rapes : 62/202 ,645 = 0.0305 % rapaciousness of asylum seekers , relative to germans : 0.0305 / 0.00157 = 19.5 given an old rate x , the new rate = 0.99 x + y * 0.01 x ~ = x ( 1 +0.01 y ) . 
  for y = 19.5 , the new rate ~ = 1.195 times the old rate . 
  well , back here we can hope to nobly keep our borders open while frowning upon germany and the border countries for abandoning their principles and shutting their borders , but i see your point . 
  though by that logic , we would n't expect the croatians to be closing their borders any time soon . 
  the germans do n't seem to be close to doing it , so the austrians , slovenians and hungarians will keep the borders open for a while too , probably . 
  how many refugees are staying in croatia ? 
  why would any government want to close the border rather than , say , offer shuttle services to the next border ? 
  suppose texas thinks that the us may collapse into anarchy by next century , while it expects mexico to become rich , powerful , and capable of protecting its states . 
  in that case , texas might be wise to leave the us and join mexico . 
  it would get more development aid , better insurance , and better military protection when it 's formally part of a stronger union than when it 's part of a weaker one . 
  britain may try for the commonwealth , or for the english-speaking world . 
  how is this the first time you 've heard bad things about sweden ? 
  do you normally only listen to media with a strong leftist agenda ? 
  when saw , the horror movie character , sets up a game , every victim knows the stakes and can make informed decisions . 
  does that mean saw is entirely non-culpable for their actions ? 
  of course not . 
  while they might make informed decisions within the game , europe has the power to change the game . 
  to take away the reward that 's dangling in front of their noses , to make the journey so dangerous that none attempt it , by giving ( some of ) the reward for free , etc. 
  i 'm not sure if their decision is wrong , a priori . 
  the odds are n't too bad of them getting good shelter for themselves , their families , and possibly even villages , for anywhere between five years and forever . 
  those who drown are the unlucky ones , not the stupid ones . 
  [ well , the important thing is you 've found a way to feel superior to both . 
  multiplying by 4-4 .7 , probably . 
  dude , we 're fine with you being gay . 
  no reason to pretend you 're a woman . 
  did n't hitler propose to have all jews sent abroad ? 
  which the british ( and other europeans ) denied because they did n't want to handle over a million semitic refugees with a history of refusing to integrate , at the tail end of one of the greatest recessions in history ? 
  i suppose that 's actually a reason to accept the immigrants , but definitely not because britain has a history of being hospitable to refugees . 
  it 's probably something a lobbyist told them . 
  all people have the capacity to learn or adapt to new situations , not just children . 
  and all people have the ability to make choices , even children . 
  and everyone would choose differently if they had better guidance/information . 
  and if there are people who deliberately choose evil , then there are children who do so as well . 
  nothing of what you say seems to distinguish between adults and children . 
  adults tend to be more arrogant , but that makes them less receptive to proper guidance , not less in need of it . 
  according to neo-nazi hooligans ? 
  his acceptance of degeneracy and cooperation in the white genocide by voting for degenerate foreigner-loving parties . 
  you do n't think there are people who would expel you for some of your beliefs ? 
  what if they happened to come to power in a democratic election , would you be fine with being expelled ? 
  how about if you 're someone with a physical shop tying you to the netherlands - would you be fine with being expelled , losing your property and your livelihood ? 
   stop treating them like children . 
  i do n't see how i 'm doing that , or if what i 'm doing is indeed that , why it would be wrong . 
  these arguments are consequentialist : people in arab countries are more likely to radicalise than people in europe . 
  while indeed european integration does n't work as well as hoped ( partially because they form closed communities where they * do n't * see people of different cultures living side by side ) , it still works better than sending them back to countries where islamism is normal . 
  ( problem is , it does n't work nearly as well as deporting them + spending the money elsewhere ( poor secular people in africa , road maintenance , lower taxes for middle and lower classes , reducing national debts , etc. ) ), 
  problem is , the system is so backed up , and current procedures so lenient , that these assholes get to stay for any duration between 6 months and forever . 
  not pro-immigration , but i 'll give it a shot : these people are the exception . 
  most of them are nice . 
  you 're not dealing with 2 % radicals , you 're dealing with 0.02 % , which is easier to manage . 
  this may indeed be grounds for being denied asylum . 
  they will be sent back , but only after a fair ruling through the appropriate channels . 
  if the courts were busy , you would n't go put suspects in prison . 
  just because they are capable of such violence does n't mean they deserve to go back to a warzone and die . 
  we do n't execute or expel football hooligans and neo-nazis , so it 's heartless to not help them when they ask us to . 
  if you send them away , they 'll radicalise further and tyrannise the local population . 
  here they can be educated , even just by example , by being forced to see people of many different cultures living side-by-side in peace . 
  even if you 've decided to send them away , where do you send them to ? 
  they often do n't have passports , and syria is a warzone . 
  few nations are looking to harbour radical islamists , so do you violate countries ' sovereignty , send people to their deaths in syria and in doing so commit crimes against humanity , lose europe 's moral superiority status , and violate syria 's sovereignty , or pay some country massive amounts to make the problem nimby but probably even bigger as that country does n't have nearly as many resources for integration . 
  is that women pretending to be men , or women not mentioning their gender and your assuming they 're men ? 
   i am not quite so sure . 
  rutte is , above everything else , a great pragmatist . 
  he knows damn well that something has to be done to help these people to integrate . 
  every report i 've seen has stated that refugees are a cost sink , at about $ 100k - $ 500k a head . 
  therefore if you convince even one refugee not to come to the netherlands , you 're saving that amount of money for the netherlands . 
  the benefits from better integration may not weigh up against the costs of making more people want to come . 
  but that 's a factual claim . 
  are they refugees under international law , and is it illegal to stop and detain trespassers ? 
  the latter seems odd , since it 's just a regular crime . 
  if the stateless ca n't be detained and/or punished for the crime of trespassing , is there any crime they can be detained and/or punished for ? 
  and since the claim is human rights violation , can anyone be detained for any crime ? 
  how about if they decide to ad hoc renounce citizenship ? 
  though even if this somehow extrapolates sort of sensibly , i would still say that paying attention to that human right now is wrong . 
  there are people , equally little in danger , equally little our responsibility , who can be helped way more for way less . 
  entire sub-saharan villages can be given access to education ( 1500 extra school-years attended ) , clean water ( 100 water purification kits ) , basic healthcare improvements ( 10 lives saved with malaria bed nets , 5000 prevented cases of non-fatal malaria , 15000 person-years of living with a parasitic bowel infection prevented ) , and a more reliable source of food ( 50 heads of cattle , with stabling and feed for 3 years ) , for the projected yearly cost of helping one migrant ( $ 100k ) . 
  edit : source : www.givewell.org, 
  there is precedent with west berlin , nazi concentration camps , ww2 pow camps on both sides , and moluccan refugee camps in the netherlands .
