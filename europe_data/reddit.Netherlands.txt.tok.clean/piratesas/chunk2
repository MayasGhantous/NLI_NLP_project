  interesting note : the head of the commission that wrote the rapport is former nato secretary general [ de hoop scheffer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaap_de_hoop_scheffer ) . 
  anyway , to say it is scathing is perhaps even underselling it . 
  take for instance this passage towards the end :  the netherlands , one of the richest countries in europe , has systematically neglected it 's responsibility . 
  under this governments tenure , marked by deeply concerning geo-political developments , the capability of the armed forces has plummeted even further . 
  defense spending remains at an historic low . 
  even though successive governments have repeatedly called nato the cornerstone of dutch defense policy , there has been no translation of this to the budget for defense . 
  the next government will have to make some big decisions . 
  in the run-up to the elections politicians will have to justify increased defense budgets not just from a societal perspective . 
  what 's at stake here is the fundamental constitutional responsibility of the armed forces as well as international commitments . 
  the political leadership has a solemn , personal responsibility here .

  you know you 've seen the pictures . 
  please , you should see what we did to the portuguese in the battle of nuremberg . 
  you 've clearly never seen the german dub of macgyver , i think it 's better than the original . 
  btw , the title : `` the insane asylum '' ( same ) old song , new tune, 
  why not go for the full-on gibberish and say `` twee\u00ebiige tweeling '', 
  you seem to have forgotten about eu regulation no .

   welcome , nj sounds like a pretty big town if it has 9 million inhabitants . 
  the netherlands as new jersey instead of it being in the uk .

  also you filled in lake ijssel , i know we built a large island there but the lake is still there you see . 
  god i still cringe when i think about that guy, 
  well , there 's no droppings on the road . 
  so that means someone is probably going by there once a day to sweep up . 
  society is functioning smoothly , carry on .

  that 's a bit of an generalization .

  what , you mean you * do n't * eat several cartons of eggs a day ? 
  then either you 're reading a different chart or you did n't understand it ... 
  what is there not to understand . 
  there is no anglo vs other languages thing going on . 
  they scored the result of the questionnaire , that 's where they ended up . 
  there is literally 0 political bullshit unless you think somehow the questions themselves were leading or the people they surveyed were not trustworthy . 
  there is a button labelled `` methodology '' you know ... 
  the ~ ~ dothraki ~ ~ ~ mongols are not from saudi arabia, 
  no that 's the case everywhere , and it 's whats got me so annoyed at this whole thing in the first place . 
  how many millions of eggs discarded because journalists did n't have anything else to report about ? 
  seriously , you 'd have to eat the entire carton of eggs in one sitting ( probably several times over ) to even have a chance of adverse effects . 
  seriously , if you just want an egg with your breakfast they 're perfectly safe . 
  this is like a wet dream by someone writing cities : skylines fanfics .

  be wary about cycling in the inner city if you do n't have experience , stay off the major traffic routes and just take the scenic route along the canals .

  the thing is the tornados here are very weak . 
  as far as i know there 's never been a tornado with actual casualties in my lifetime .

  that is a very large selection of cities you 've got there . 
  i think you might try looking around some old threads in / r/askeurope . 
  those cities are pretty popular destinations so there should be plenty of other people who have asked similar questions . 
  in amsterdam look for the kalverstraat , right in the center of the city and filled to the brim with clothing stores . 
  unfortunately it 's not exactly known for being cheap ( in fact it 's the opposite ) . 
  however , if you 're looking to spend some time shopping you ca n't miss it . 
  in terms of restaurants , stay away from the crowded tourist areas . 
  like everywhere else their prices are inflated and the food is probably not the best . 
  do n't worry about going into some smaller local place that does n't look like it 's for tourists , they 'll all speak english regardless . 
  so , how about that m\u00e1xima huh * nudgenudge winkwink *,

  the perfect example of why burning down a building to make a political point is a bad idea . 
  it gives hitler the excuse to seize power and arrest political opponents .
