  meeting them is always a blast , they 're always eager to take me to their favorite restaurant and blast me with questions . 
  indonesia is also mindbogglingly big , at least for someone from the netherlands . 
  you could go there 10 times and not visit the same place twice . 
  there are however some real downsides to the country : it 's poor , corrupt , crowded and in some places incredibly polluted . 
  you have to find the good spots in between , but when you do it 's a beautiful country . 
  my parents never took me to any place than southern france during my entire childhood . 
  by my count i 'm now at 16 different countries visited , and i 'm still pretty much a broke bum . 
  flights are pretty cheap and easy nowadays . 
  i do n't think there would be any significant difference between camping in cornwall or camping in spain . 
  apparently afrikaans is a more conservative language than dutch , which is probably why it sounds a bit old timey . 
  kind of like 16th/17th century dutch ... from which it is derived . 
  funny how that works out, 
  i think most of them probably have never set foot in europe, 
  hey man , i 'm with you . 
  i refuse to let 5 years of nazi retards ruin a perfectly fine 400 year old flag, 
  stage 1 : denial, 
  we do n't really have a conqueror . 
  the closest thing would probably be an admiral like de ruyter . 
  probably viewed somewhat like how nelson is viewed in the uk . 
  very boring . 
  eggs + toast in the morning , bread + whatever for lunch . 
  i pass the supermarket when i go home every day so i pick up dinner thenl . 
  any combination of carb , protein and vegetable . 
  potato , meat and broccoli . 
  pasta , fish , spinach . 
  rice , chicken , kale . 
  whatever , as long as it has those 3 things . 
  chinese , but i 'm half chinese so i get to play that card and make my friends come with me , 
  if we 're going by hours sunk , in no particular order : soul calibur iv , skate 2 , mass effect 2 , shogun 2 : total war , crusader kings ii , league of legends , halo 3 , day of defeat , and unreal tournament . 
  but that 's like 15 years worth . 
  i 've had a windows 95 pc , xbox , xbox 360 , gameboy , ds , ps3 and now i 'm back to pc . 
  which was my favorite videogame in all that time ? 
  no idea . 
  in my place it used to be gva : `` groente , vlees , en aardappelen '' vegetables , meat , and potatoes . 
  any combination will do . 
   alle die mit uns auf kaperfahrt fahren [ now just wait a goddamn minute ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbejooxfooa ), 
  where i lived they were popular in the 16-18 crowd , since they could n't get drivers licences yet . 
  you 'll find them everywhere , some place more than others \\* cough ** italy * \\* cough * still , nowhere near the numbers you see in some asian countries . 
  wondering whether that absinthe did anything special or not ... 
  there was a camp near the city where i grew up , stayed there for a couple of months and then they moved on . 
  they were everything my young self had imagined gypsies would be like , right down to the wagons and dress . 
  like other people said , europe has it 's own native blueberry . 
  they look very similar , the name is very similar but i 'm told the taste is different than the american blueberry , more sour i think . 
  i just know them as `` blauwe bosbes '' ( `` blue woodberry '' , bilberry in english ), 
  lyme disease is no joke kids . 
  if you spend a time in an area where ticks live , make sure to check all exposed areas of skin for ticks in the shower . 
  if a [ spot with a large red circle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/erythema_migrans_-_erythematous_rash_in_lyme_disease_-_phil_9875.jpg/220px-erythema_migrans_-_erythematous_rash_in_lyme_disease_-_phil_9875.jpg ) shows up on your body , go to the doctor . 
  ohhh so it 's like a liquid salmiak thing ? 
  yeah that sounds awful ... 
  the dude has a phd in evolutionary biology and is head curator of one of the most prestigious museums in the country . 
  what more would he have to do before you 'd count him as intellectual ? 
  not appear on television ? 
  not work with kids ? 
  one of these days we 'll need to get off our asses and actually do it . 
  [ prime minister harry potter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_peter_balkenende ) , and not in the sense of a fully grown daniel radcliffe . 
  in the sense of the scrawny bespectacled 12 year old . 
  and here i though my surname was rare but there 's a whole 382 of us !, 
  but my mothers maiden name has 384 . 
  considering my mother was not born in the netherlands , let alone this continent ... 
  i 'm not sure which is more surprising . 
  i still watch the news almost every day . 
  there are also plenty of more in-depth programs that deal with actualities that i watch . 
  although technically i could stream both on my pc . 
  also , when i have like friends over and we want to watch a movie i 'll stream it to my tv . 
  other than that , any sort of regular entertainment show or movies i 'm watching i do it on my pc . 
  once a day , usually late afternoon or right after dinner . 
  i wash my hair everyday because my hair is rather long ( for a guy anyway ) and i use a lot of gel , so if i do n't wash it it turns into this disgusting greasy mess . 
  that 's not true , you could toss it out, 
  are you seriously saying we 'd not like flanders to be part of the netherlands if such a thing were to pass ? 
  yup . 
  they could n't have picked a barn owl or kestrel or some other cool bird . 
  no they had to pick this retard on stilts that survives by repeatedly dunking its dumb face in the mud , appropriate as that may be . 
   bus of them at leiden central how long have they been there ? 
  because i was born and raised in leiden and passed by there twice a day for years , and i 've no recollection of ever seeing a street preacher ... 
  i ca n't think of anything besides maybe some football songs . 
  but looking around on youtube led me to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8m6ibitrgk ) , which is the most amazingly eurotrash thing i 've seen in a while . 
  i just thought i 'd share . 
  carry on . 
  no , the hospital . 
  they have revolving doors . 
  the cat actually likes to put his butt on the tank because there 's a heating element in there . 
  the turtles like to chase the cat 's tail as it wags , but they 'll chase any movement . 
  the cat has never actually shown any interest in the turtles but the turtles are still small ( 10 cm ) , so i 'm not gon na introduce them to find out how well they get along, 
  two [ yellowbellied sliders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yellow-bellied_slider ) , one male one female ... probably . 
  i 'm not too sure . 
  wo n't be an issue since to reproduce they need a large beach apparently . 
  also , just a regular housecat . 
  band of brothers is the standard that everything else gets compared to . 
  inglorious basterds was also great , maybe not tarantinos best work but still a must watch in my book . 
  christoph waltz is legendary . 
  also , if you 're interested in this sort of stuff check out [ fury ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2713180/ ), 
  not really , it uses `` like '' which dutch does n't and the structure seems shuffled . 
  `` ik hou het meest van warmte en mild weer '' is how i think you 'd translate it, 
  i think the ardennes are pretty well known in the public mind, 
  i blame the italians, 
  uhhh , depends on whether you ask a dutchman or a belgian . 
  opinions differ ... 
  it sounds like black and white if that makes sense . 
  the long con, 
  you should consider just taking the regular intercity trains .
