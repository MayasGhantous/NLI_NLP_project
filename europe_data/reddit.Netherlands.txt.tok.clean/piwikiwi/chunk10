  is that all ? 
   ( english transcription looks horrendously ) tsjaikovski is what they make of it in dutch :p .  ah , i missed - i thought you had tchaikovsky in mind i 'm personally not a huge fan of tchaikovsky but i like other russian romantics like mussorgsky and rimsky-korsakov . 
  still good choices ^ ^, 
  you excluded stravinsky :(, 
  ilja repin is a fantastic painter !, 
  here are a few of his pictures : [ * mussorgsky ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/ilya_repin_-_%d0%9f%d0%be%d1%80%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%82_%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%b7%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b0_%d0%9c.%d0%9f.%d0%9c%d1%83%d1%81%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b3%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be_-_google_art_project.jpg ) [ * tolstoy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/tolstoy_by_repin_1901.jpg ) one of my two favourite classical composers is russian : igor stravinsky . 
  here are some of his pieces : [ * dumbarton oaks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx6fd5b5lbq ) [ * the fourth movement of his violin concerto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_ghgbr0y1e ) [ * petrushka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx7assic7em ) [ * agon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eahct70rcsa ), 
   definitly culture - i 'm big fan of russian classical music ( composers like eg . 
  rachmaninoff , shostakovich , prokofiev or opera singers like anna netrebko ) . 
  also other disciplines like balley or literature you forget the best one , 
  the headline should be : russian burns russian flowers bought from the netherlands . 
   you call it spineless , i call it pragmatic . 
  i called the politicians spineless because they are populists and refuse to admit that this might not be something we can win . 
  ( without destroying the world . ), 
  you call yourself pragmatic but ca n't see any other things we can do other than all out war ? 
  sure ... 
   i cross it and enjoy some stroopwafel just to spite the dutch . 
  please , no !, 
  stop !, 
  do n't spite us by buying our products , it hurts so much . 
  english that is , not american , 
  they would n't want to bomb their fancy apartments, 
  not-berlin , basically ? 
  i 'm okay with that as long as they pay for them first, 
  in other words : the dutch government is still searching for their spine, 
  that 's why your population is shrinking germany !, 
  in germany they somehow have the weird tradition of being polite to each other . 
  traitors to the republic , that is what they are !, 
  too soon !, 
  politics is really private as well . 
  i 've dated a german girl for a year and she never wanted to tell me what she voted for . 
   who the hell wants to burn or gas refugees in europe ? 
  in the immigration thread there were people talking about letting refugees drown/letting africans die of ebola . 
  and maybe the uk, 
  germany , denmark and belgium, 
  i prefer to keep the frisians and let groningen be independent, 
  i 'm from zuid holland and belgian television is just better a lot of the times . 
  but seriously . 
  why would someone bribe a spokesperson ? 
  they are just a glorified pr agent . 
  i wonder what that would feel like . 
  i think it was the initial estimates or something . 
  no one was injured according to nrc handelsblad and the volkskrant . 
  ( two quality newspapers ), 
   kick him where ? 
  or just kick him, 
   do you honestly think people on average are to dumb to understand cause and effect ? 
  i do n't think that they are dumb ; i think that they are too busy with their own day-to-day lives . 
  do you know have few people have actually bothered to read the party programs of the parties which they are voting for ? 
  and that is 3 pages at most . 
  i wish i had your believe in mankind . 
   what you do n't seem to get is that those common people you do n't trust to make sensible decisions in a direct democracy are the exact same people that you trust to decide who should make those decisions instead of them . 
  in reality you already rely on the `` wisdom of the crowd '' since your life is shaped by the decisions of the people who have been given power by the common man . 
  exactly , but the difference is that the common people do n't risk their career when they make a poorly thought out decision . 
   what we need is to do away with a professional political class and their non-binding pre-election promises all together and implement a direct democratic system concerned with the practical decisions of the day . 
  i disagree , this would make running a country impossible . 
  people should learn to have more realistic expectations when it comes to politics . 
  ruling without doing concessions is impossible . 
  i ca n't think of a worse idea than installing a direct democracy . 
  people would probably want to government to do more stuff while paying less tax . 
  the english used the same type of reasoning when it came to the irish potato famine . 
  we all know how that ended . 
  that 's because it is bullshit :'), 
  hi thomas malthus , i though you were dead . 
  i think a loosely united benelux would be a good idea . 
  our position in the eu would be a lot stronger . 
  i do n't know how the belgians would feel about having another government . 
  are you sure you are not english ? 
  i want to punch the person who wrote this title in the face . 
  that is all there is to it . 
  you are , like me , probably so used to the idea of a nation state that it is hard to imagine that it did n't exist 600 years ago . 
   we must stay at constant vigil though that is just politics . 
  just accept that there is n't a perfect system or a perfect goal to strive for and just fine tune it when you go along . 
  it has worked so far . 
  you are right and i also think that it is a last resort . 
  it should n't be easy to ban a party and it is n't easy . 
   wow , i seriously ca n't understand how an educated person thinks that simply `` banning '' a party removes their supporters and eliminates their ideology . 
  it does n't . 
  what it does is it bans them from using the political system to gain power . 
   by banning political parties you are 1 ) being incredibly undemocratic and autocratic , i have no problems with that . 
  i do n't think that absolute democracy is worth striving for . 
   2 ) you are strengthening the cause of those that have now had their voices silenced . 
  i 'm not a nazi or a white supremacist i disagree , by giving them a political platform you are giving them a legitimacy . 
  political parties with racist ideas have been banned here in the past and they clearly took a big hit because of it . 
  democracy is a very vulnerable system that needs to be protected from people who want to abolish it like communists , nazis and authoritarian religious parties . 
  the same goes for the concept of equality ; we ca n't have the majority decide that minorities should have less rights . 
  i do n't want to arrest people who think like that . 
  i just want to deny them a political platform . 
  nazism has show how vulnerable democracy can be and it needs to be protected from that . 
   enacting anti-hate laws does n't eliminate hate anymore than laws against holocaust denial will prevent another holocaust . 
  banning political parties who openly express those idea surely prevents it from gaining any political support . 
   if you believe in rule by the people , then you have to put your faith in people that , given all the information , they will make the right decisions . 
  that is why i do n't believe in a direct democracy :'), 
  i did n't know that . 
  ah well you can just download it, 
  berlin, 
   have you seen got ? 
  i 've seen daytime commercials with more sex than got . 
  it is not and you can just download it if you really want it . 
  sneeuw which means ** snow **,
