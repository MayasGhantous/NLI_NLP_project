  this suggests that there was n't much vegetation . 
  it was quite harsh tundra after all, 
  because they are seriously hilarious, 
  you have the power now , use it , dispatch them ^ ^, 
  nice !, 
  thank you !, 
  thank you !, 
  how on earth did romania end up with a roman language btw ? 
   kids need space . 
  renting or buying a house or big apartment costs a fortune in germany you are joking right ? 
  buying a house in germany is cheap compared to the netherlands and the uk, 
   the over the top feminism does n't help . 
  american redditors complaining about feminism would freak out here . 
  like what ? 
  wanting a career ? 
  as long as we can stay rude and direct , it is more efficient . 
  that is how it works in the netherlands right now . 
  only aow is paid by the people currently working . 
  dutch newspapers are still alright . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  it is indi\u00eb my friend . 
  not indonesi\u00eb . 
  mehmet ii best turk of all time !, 
  man, 
  franco is 30 years later . 
  i 'm talking about assassinations and bombings . 
  i know that they blow up/murdered quite a lot of people in the 19th/early 20th century . 
  both movements are an insult to people 's intelligence anyway, 
  we did it reddit !, 
   photos from the prettiest cities in poland ( skip warsaw , krak\u00f3w , gda\u0144sk , wroc\u0142aw , zakopane if you want to avoid tons of tourists and high prices ) http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1507998 lol my parents are in wroclaw at the moment :p, 
  sweden also has a higher average summer temperature than the netherlands and the uk . 
  thank you high school geography/geology, 
  plenty of catholic africans to choose from . 
  hehe, 
  do not forget that the vast majority of dutch jews were deported and killed . 
  the highest number in western europe . 
  i know and i know that it is stupid to blame anyone now . 
  it actually only reinforces my view that europe should be united , so that things like the holocaust and other crimes against humanity should never happen again . 
  ethnic cleansing is never justified period . 
  some of these german speaking minorities lived there for centuries btw . 
  this headline sucks . 
  hmm i can play doctor gradua ad parnassum from the children 's corner , that one is quite easy . 
  i see if i can play the arabesque and the fille thingy , thank you for the recommendation !, 
  i love his later compositions . 
  they are impossibly hard though :(, 
  and they did n't complain about rite of spring ? 
  that is about a pagan ritual where a young girl dances herself to death as a sacrifice xd  it was more to do with the imagery , i think . 
  i actually do n't know what it is about , haha . 
  i should look it up . 
  the recording is protected by copyright in that case . 
  you can get the sheet music for free . 
  hahaha jesus , mussorgsky is n't even that dissonant :'), 
  i 'm currently playing il vecchio castello from this piece ^ ^,

   until he got murdered but let 's not open that can of worms * gets his can-opener * damn vegans . 
  they are all violent thugs !, 
  coughermanycough, 
  also in the netherlands . 
  my reaction when i saw the picture was : '' this is normal , right ? '', 
  i imagine they get along quite well on a personal level . 
  they need to distract the attention away from fucking up the reforms in the elderly/disabled people care somehow . 
  call me crazy but if i was a politician i would simply threaten the tobacco companies with a whole range of restrictive laws if they win this . 
  you ca n't have companies dictate what a government can and can not do . 
  reminds me of the spanish civil war, 
  the byzantines called themselves romaioi or romioi . 
  i do n't think i have to translate that , they are the roman empire . 
  i 'm only talking about the empire btw , not the kingdom or the republic . 
  i do n't know how to say what i mean in english :p . something like it is one country from william the conquerer onwards . 
  and the uk is not a single lineage of kings but we still see it as one continuous line . 
   was a republic for the first 600 years i know , that is why i did n't count them . 
  the roman empire lasted for nearly 1500 years, 
   exactly , but do n't fuck with the riot police . 
  regular police is pretty nice , but i would n't exclude that generally police attracts a certain kind of people with questionable psychology but of course not all have . 
  riot police are just people who get paid to riot . 
  at least that is what my friend said who worked as an intern for the dutch police . 
  i 'm okay with that as long as cameron stays as far away as possible, 
  could you post a picture of what you think is a correct fit ? 
  the sleeves look too short to me but it seems fine otherwise . 
  damn vikings ruining everything . 
   more power for the oranje dynasty ... dear lord , this should never happen again . 
  1581 would be my choice because of [ plakkaat van verlatinghe ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/plakkaat_van_verlatinghe ), 
  heineken = canal water, 
  louis andriessen is pretty famous and so is jan pieterszoon sweelinck, 
  aw shit , fucking hre with it 's border gore . 
  mozart was born in salzburg , that is in austria right ? 
  i think you have mistaken him for beethoven , who was born in bonn, 
  louis andriessen : http://youtu.be/kxghreg2j-a he is still alive ^ ^, 
  szymanowski is pretty awesome as well, 
  i love danish < 3, 
  thank you for sharing , some of them are really nice !, 
   does n't help that for some reason a dutch movie always needs a overly dramatic scene with screaming and cursing . 
  after the obligatorily naked scene of course . 
  so a bit like hbo series then ? 
   afterwards , we fight amongst ourselves . 
  that would make a lot of arabs very proud . 
   or a more reasonable or just take constantinople back . 
  do we really want more frisians ? 
  that is like a fat version of finland, 
  louis bonaparte , best king of the netherlands :'(,
