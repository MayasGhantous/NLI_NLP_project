  ah goddamit , and i have a german exam in 6 weeks time, 
  and k\u00fcchen and sp\u00e4tzle, 
  we do n't even have tank anymore , so now it is just a sad reminder of what things used to be :(, 
  they really need to abolish the european council, 
  hmm , that is way harder . 
  we got the people that invented big brother but i do n't if we should mention that publicly, 
  your are too pessimistic . 
  look at how peaceful we are in comparison to 100 years ago . 
  rembrandt and van gogh, 
  and beethoven and bach, 
  but neither is a cathedral, 
  why not ? 
  maybe it is has to do with geological factors . 
  the ground in the netherlands is terrible to built on because it is sinking all the time , i think that is why we do n't have any skyscrapers . 
  junker warns of risks of burning through popcorn . 
  it is not the same . 
  we used to have that before we had gay marriage as well . 
  haha , it would be hilarious if ireland would have same-sex marriage before germany . 
  or sad , mostly just sad . 
  i never said it was completely uninhabited . 
  another important aspect is that it kind of pales in comparison to the exploitation of africans/native americans . 
  the eastern portion is the kazan khanate and the southern portion is the nogai horde . 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/khanate_of_kazan http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nogai_horde, 
  they do n't get criticised as much because it was largely uninhabited . 
  yay ? 
  thank you !, 
  have you seen birdman ? 
  it is fucking amazing, 
  *** infinite jest *** by david foster wallace *** de geruchten ( the rumors ) *** by hugo claus, 
  waht does hir stand for ? 
  i tried doing the ones with the capital cities and this is much harder . 
  i got 114 out of 141 with that one . 
  i somehow got macedonia wrong ( i clicked on bulgaria ) , after getting bulgaria right : s. 140/141, 
  for some context : sweden , norway , spain and france are all quite a bit bigger than germany . 
  so are ukraine and russia but i thought that was kind of obvious . 
  it was a bit darker than normal . 
  yes, 
  i do n't really want this coalition to go . 
  yay !, 
  i thought the opinions here where a bit too extreme left and i am center left myself . 
  good point !, 
  i hand ' t thought of that . 
  but we could get ironically rich by using our entrepreneurial skills, 
  ah well it just seemed like everything criticizing this got downvoted very heavily . 
  and they are both batshit crazy . 
  is it me or is this thread being brigaded ? 
  we need to go there and sell them herbal tea and gluten free cookies . 
  not in the netherlands or the uk, 
  my ears !, 
  it hurts so much :'(, 
  reuters is good but their website is annoying . 
  nrc handelsblad and trouw are good dutch newspapers . 
  us is cheaper most of the time . 
  do n't forget sp\u00e4tzle , br\u00f6tchen und schwarzw\u00e4lder kirschtorte , then my love for you will be strong like the dikes around my polder . 
  how trustworthy is this ? 
  hold me helmut !, 
  thank you !, 
  i really appreciate it . 
  it seems like it will be doable for me ^ ^, 
  thank you !, 
  that is still manageable  . 
  how much for food and drink etc ? 
  i 'm thinking about studying in oslo for half a year . 
  how much does an average student room cost ? 
  i pay 700 euros for a 20 m2 living room , my own kitchen and bathroom and attic to sleep in . 
  thanks mom and dad !, 
  400 euros is fucking ridiculous though , how big is your room ? 
  the food is great in germany and much cheaper . 
  this is painfully accurate . 
  hutspot is good . 
  well i was at -1 and normally i would n't complain but i thought it was very weird to get downvoted for this in this thread . 
  thank you !, 
  i was so happy when i heard he was going to do another tiffany aching :( . 
  i just completed my collection like 2 months ago and was really looking forward to another one . 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  what the fuck : s, 
  poor ~ ~ monkey ~ ~ ~ ~ ape ~ ~ librarian :(, 
  william iii as the king of england is a pretty decisive victory imho, 
  i see the belgians finally starting to acknowledge dutch rule by putting a monument in honour of willem ii in their coin . 
  he probably just caught a cold or something , no need to get our hopes up , 
  the plural for apfel is so weird in german : \u00c4pfel . 
  the dutch word for orange is `` sinaasappel '' . 
  `` appelsien '' is really archaic and nobody uses it anymore . 
  people who say that tend to ignore history and therefore do n't realize that all countries that `` rebuild '' themselves did so at the cost of thousands of lives . 
  almere , zoetermeer and lelystad are really ugly but not that unsafe . 
  eindhoven sucks a lot though . 
   though to be totally honest , as organized as your government is , i would n't want them . 
  your taxes were raised , the costs of living went up , education became more expensive and student grants were taken , causing the flood of dutchies to flemish universities to swell even more . 
  you are right but dutch people are really conformists and as long as it does n't get worse people will just accept it . 
  i can understand that it is annoying to have so many dutch students but it kind of hard to ignore such a good offer . 
  you education system is better and cheaper . 
   basically you all got to pay more and got back less , even with your debts that were definitely not that bad . 
  how the hell is nobody complaining ? 
  besides wilders who now blames the eu for everything , besides muslims ( as usual ) . 
  like i said , nobody feels like they need to complain because our country is stable at the moment . 
  haha aww . 
  what is norwegian about cheese slicers ? 
  better food in general , speak better dutch , shitty government . 
  haha , i hope not . 
  they are tolerable .
