   it may be necessary , but why not take it without the hypocrisy . 
  because people do not like to hear that . 
  people do n't want to hear the harsh truth about realpolitik . 
  we have unrealistic exceptions of our politicians . 
  we expect them to be perfect and charming , but also want them to be authentic . 
  i do n't have to tell you that those people do n't exist . 
   this is about kosovo , not macedonia nor bosnia . 
  it always is . 
   i 'm no fan of alde or verhofstadt 's openvld , but if i were a supporter i 'd be furious at his attempt to court ppe i am not disappointed . 
  i am currently willing to sacrifice a lot of things for a stronger eu . 
  i have no idea if this will be a step in the right direction . 
  i do n't get it . 
  this is exactly what everyone thought would happen . 
  punitive sounds so negative , i would like to rebrand it as `` creating business opportunities for our banking sector '' . 
  haha , that is embarrassing . 
  i forgot about him . 
  i am personally not the biggest fan of his music but he really is a great composer so i will add him . 
  to add to the already mentioned tchaikovsky and rachmaninoff . 
  ** music ** [ sergei prokofiev ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4tyq97jcr0 ) : virtuoso pianist and great composer . 
  one of the most renowned orchestrators and basically wrote something in ever classical genre . 
  [ igor stravinsky  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldez514_nfa ) in my not so humble opinion he is the greatest composer since bach . 
  he mostly composed orchestral music and his music is very recognisable . 
  both prokofiev and stravinsky have strongly influenced film music , such as the star wars ost . 
  [ rimsky-korsakov  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqnymnatr-y ) great composer and he literally wrote the book on orchestration . 
  [ modest mussorgsky  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuah14grp4 ) great innovative composer . 
  [ dmitri shostakovich  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjvttfbpwjy ) i almost forgot about him but / u/naekro was so kind to remind me ^ ^ . 
  fantastic composers with a strong and very dark style . 
  he was often tormented by stalin and wrote a piece to celebrate the death of stalin after he passed away . 
  ** art ** [ ilya repin ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/ilya_repin_-_sadko_-_google_art_project_levels_adjustment.jpg/728px-ilya_repin_-_sadko_-_google_art_project_levels_adjustment.jpg ) [ viktor vasnetsov ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/19-v_2h_vasnetsov.jpg/1280px-19-v_2h_vasnetsov.jpg ) [ nikolay kasatkin ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/%d0%a1%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%80_%d1%83%d0%b3%d0%bb%d1%8f_%d0%b1%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%bc%d0%b8_%d0%bd%d0%b0_%d0%b2%d1%8b%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b9_%d1%88%d0%b0%d1%85%d1%82%d0%b5.jpg ) sidenote : for the people in the netherlands , if you like these paintings there is a big exhibition with works by these artists in the drents museum in assen until the 2nd of april . 
  all of the paintings i 've link are being displayed there and more , including repin 's famous paintings of tolstoj ( !, 
  lol , the uk ca n't do shit . 
  may ca n't even open her mouth without causing the markets to lose money :'d, 
  you are right , as a euro federalist , it is in my interests to screw over the uk when they leave the eu . 
  i am sure you will understand this . 
  because japan was united while china was a mess . 
  it would also have been likely that other major powers would equip the japanese just to disrupt the plans of the colonisers . 
  fun fact : the reason the japanese modernised their armies so quickly is exactly because they were afraid that it might happen . 
  the anti western faction in society had no problem using western tech , unlike similar factions in china . 
  is it really a colony if they can arrest your representatives and execute them if they break your rules ? 
  cause the japanese could . 
  the only reason we were allowed to trade there was because we provided information of the rest of the world without spreading christianity . 
  the people , aka the shogunate , that accepted the opening of japan ousted in a rebellion that fought under the battlecry of `` expel the barbarians , restore the emperor '' . 
  ( i forgot why i was typing this but enjoy today 's useless trivia ), 
  the dutch were only allowed because they did n't try to convert people . 
  the brits made an assessment on the possibilities of colonising japan and their conclusion was that it would have been a blood bath for the europeans ; way too big population , too united and too warlike . 
  the menu for 2017 consists of : * raiding medway again * `` inviting '' another invasion and a regime change . 
  ( we will let you call it a revolution this time as well ), 
  basically yes , it does n't matter if it is unfair , he has no one else to work with . 
  they took a risk working with him and he abandoned them, 
  he fucked over his only political allies . 
  it is unlikely he will get the same chance again, 
  we also make a fuckton of money because of the eu, 
  no , you do n't get it . 
  we should be proud !, 
  those other plebs ca n't pay as much as us . 
  we would just bankrupt ourselves and all trade will go through hamburg . 
  he got cocky and lost, 
  yay !, 
  people tend to be open to experimenting if they are starving to death . 
   just in case we ever meet an ancient roman . 
  trajan is turning in his grave . 
  brexit threatens the existence of the eu and the breaking up of the eu could have dire economic and political implications for all of us . 
  that is why we are upset and as a consequence we will try to get the best deal possible and the political part is as important as the economic part . 
  basically the uk chose to go on alone and do what is the best for them but the eu will do the same and simply holds the cards here . 
  do n't engage in political power play if your cards are shit and then expect people to treat you nicely . 
  do n't know rotterdam all that well but probably yes . 
  although not perfect , there are a lot of cool buildings in rotterdam . 
  especially the eramus bridge is amazing . 
  what !? 
  hutspot is the only good stamppot . 
  you 've clearly only had supermarket cheese . 
  ( if you insult our cheese again i will out ketchup on my pasta next time i eat it and make you watch a video of it ), 
  amen, 
  tell that to my 300 dead country mates, 
  again ? 
  watch out for russians , austrians and prussians, 
  so it is in our best interests to destroy the strongest military alliance in history or destroy the federation that is the second economy in the world ? 
  and of all that because of the problems with immigrants ? 
  i will never be the on to deny that there are difficult problems to resolve when it comes to the issues you address but nato and the eu has nothing to do with it . 
  if you set good policies that reward the people integrating and punish those that do n't and create a good way to police our borders than these problems might not exist in the future . 
  what you are promoting is reactionary cowardice just because things are going as smoothly as we would like . 
  also , speaking just for the netherlands : 50 % of our gdp depends on trade with the eu . 
  we would be beyond moronic to risk that because it could create much much more societal instabilities . 
   these alliances and friendships you speak of are based on shared values , or , less aptly put , ideology , not interests , therefore betraying them is merely a betrayal to the values which are no longer shared , not the best interests of the country . 
  so what are our shared values with russia ? 
  we are not stuck in the 19th century imperial mindset , we support lgbt rights , we do n't invade our neighbours . 
  the new right wing parties are just children that want to burn everything to the ground because they do n't get their way , as opposed to the patriots they portray themselves as . 
  if they were patriots they would fight for our global influence , our trade networks and promote the way we handle human rights . 
  their interests is fucking over our friends and weakening our alliances . 
  these people are not patriots , they hate their own country more than the far left does and that is quite an achievement . 
  ah true nationalism , by being a russian lapdog . 
   pretty much ... . calling russia of that time '' russia empire '' or '' soviet union '' would be wrong , since it was in deep civil war that did n't fully end until early 1920 's . 
  ended in the wrong way :(, 
  we looked at letters written by d\u00fcrer in art history class and i swear the language he spoke was almost closer to dutch, 
  as a dutch person the immorality of this fills me with patriotism and disgust . 
  that is ana amazing building , thank you for posting that . 
  a lot of it is the same uninspiring neoclassical bullshit with the same forms of decorations that was used for centuries . 
  nah , we did the burning in 1667, 
  maybe, 
  their are obvious differences between people living in different places of course , but the like you said it is all gradual ; no hard dividing lines .
