  plus africa itself is the most genetically diverse continent and oldschool race theory lumps all africans together . 
  we can try invading again if you want . 
  it worked last time, 
  they belong to us . 
  ^ and so do you, 
  it is almost as if dividing humans into races is pseudoscientific bullshit , 
  explain please ? 
  they shot someone trying a similar thing a few months ago . 
  the subtext is still the same, 
  your first mistake was wanting to go out in amsterdam, 
  and they stylishly froze to death in russia in their pretty uniforms, 
  not here in the netherlands . 
  there is a lot of maintenance being done in the general area where i live . 
  roads are generally extremely good in comparison to germany and france from my experience . 
  good point , i was mostly confused by the title, 
  i agree , or olympia , d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe or one of degas ' bathing women . 
  it feels a bit random like this . 
  i expected the following at least : * [ le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe by manet for france ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/edouard_manet_-_luncheon_on_the_grass_-_google_art_project.jpg/1280px-edouard_manet_-_luncheon_on_the_grass_-_google_art_project.jpg ) * [ venus of urbino by titian for italy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/tiziano_-_venere_di_urbino_-_google_art_project.jpg/1024px-tiziano_-_venere_di_urbino_-_google_art_project.jpg ) * [ bathseba at her bath by rembrandt for the netherlands ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/rembrandt_-_bathsheba_at_her_bath_-_wga19090.jpg/775px-rembrandt_-_bathsheba_at_her_bath_-_wga19090.jpg ), 
  he also worked on the moomin animated series iirc, 
  second generation immigrants generally do n't do that well . 
  see the rise if italian mafia in the us . 
  so what ? 
  maybe we should show them what we can really do if we plot against them . 
  it should have been michelangelo or raphael imho and not davinci . 
  how about germany stops financing russia . 
  idolatrous worship of saints and relics . 
  with germany it can be kind of hilarious . 
  `` we need a national architectural style ! '', 
  and then continue to argue between gothic , which originated in france , or neoclassical , which was inspired by the romans whim they barely even belonged to . 
  yes , stillbirths are a sad thing my friend :(, 
  i was going to say it was in 1688 and 1667 , 
   anyone else remember when the ~ ~ new york times ~ ~ united kingdom was relatively respectable ? 
  i study art history and it seems i got my terminology mixed up , my apologies !, 
  anyway aside from semantics my point still stands , i find the buildings build in the tradition of palladio generally too much alike and quite dull . 
  i 've study in amsterdam and been to copenhagen and paris in the last month and to see the same elements used over and over again is a bit too much . 
  baroque architects like bernini or borromini , the two most famous who worked in that style , are very clearly working in the tradition of palladio ; the person who used vitruvius ' writing on roman architecture to reinvigorate the classical style . 
  sure baroque architects adopted the innovations of michelangelo and those of bramante but it is weird to deny that basically any building pre 20th century that uses order columns is not neoclassical . 
  edit : hell it is even in the first sentence of the wikipedia article on baroque architecture  baroque architecture is the building style of the baroque era , begun in late 16th-century italy , ** that took the roman vocabulary ** of renaissance architecture and used it in a new rhetorical and theatrical fashion , often to express the triumph of the catholic church . 
  it was characterized by new explorations of form , light and shadow , and dramatic intensity . 
  baroque architecture is neoclassical in its vocabulary, 
  oh and that sure helped the german minority in the long run because how many are there left now ? 
  ugh not another neoclassical building . 
  i mean , they do n't look too bad but they all look the same . 
  because different materials lend themselves to different shapes . 
  it would be dumb to build a castle like that out of glass , concrete and steel . 
  he is a slimy dbag but a charismatic one . 
  i do agree with a lot of his views though but never forget that he is just very good at being a slimy dbag, 
  -3 culture for being kitschy trash, 
  art from 1400-1900 ? 
  i used to drink 1,5-2 liters of milk a day , haha, 
  okay fine then just stop negotiating and let them have their hard brexit . 
  china has shit soft power : they are uncool and not really popular and russia is just severely disliked by everyone, 
  i can see this church from my bed right now , haha, 
  ah thanks for correcting me , it has been a while since i read a book about so i am probably remembering it wrong, 
  the ummayyad 's benefited hugely from the earlier failures of the persians and the byzantines . 
  when you are a christian monophysite from egypt and you get to choose between being killed as a heretic by the byzantines , a serv to the persias of just paying a little tax because of your religion to the arabs ( or be killed if you dont ) ; the choice is easy to make . 
  [ goddamn right ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/bakker_schut-plan.png/500px-bakker_schut-plan.png ), 
  i thought they were for the elderly so they can scare the shit out of normal cylcists with their lack of awareness, 
  oh , haha good point, 
  i meant dangerous in the sense of becoming japan 2.0 . 
  which is dangerous in itself since growth is exponential, 
  i agree , but they actually helped them separate the men from the women . 
  we could have not helped them do it . 
  also true ,, 
  do they really ? 
  i mean , merkel herself would not get blamed for extreme right stuff so i ca n't imagine the same would happen to spd, 
  like rebuilding the whole fucking city or building a palace with the worth of 1/3 of the gdp, 
  people would spend insane amounts in the past . 
  that would be unacceptable today . 
  err , evil is hard to define in a time when everyone was an asshole . 
  gothic churches were painted in bright colours . 
  [ sainte chapelle in paris ] ( http://www.parismuseumpass.com/datas/musees/s/a/sainte-chapelle/xl/sainte-chapelle-4cd2e13d6cbbd.jpg ) still has them and [ in saint-denis they have painted small parts of the vaulting ] ( http://www.montjoye.net/images/abbayes-eglises/idf/93/basilique-saint-denis/basilique-saint-denis-clef-voute-1-homme.jpg ) to show the original colours . 
  [ in amiens they use projectors to show what it looked liked ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zw2qj0knoxg/uylab924jwi/aaaaaaaacxm/vq2ekr-qtkm/s1600/amiens_cathedral_son_et_lumie%25cc%2580re_002.jpg ), 
  probably , same for gothic churches . 
  [ manifest destiny part ii : alligator boogaloo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85uv0pcvvsi ), 
  i was positively surprised when i visited paris for 4 days last week . 
  people are just as uninterested as in amsterdam so it was n't too bad . 
  go and watch neon demon if you have n't yet . 
  and bladerunner of course but that is kind of stating the obvious , lol, 
  lol wut , remember breivik ? 
  germans protestants are pseudo catholics anyway , 
  i do n't think that the ban on inciting violence is controversial in germany . 
  wilders is a dick but he would punch you for calling him a nazi . 
  he is super pro israel , lol, 
  ironically the places where people vote far right in my country do n't have any immigrants at all . 
  they just shoot people here mostly , the russians and yugoslavians that is, 
  to be fair , france is a mess . 
  it is working much better here in the netherlands even though it is not perfect, 
  accept the trainwreck is germany getting buried in cash ?

  nah mate , we get nothern ireland , again . 
   bysantic culture was more attractive than turkic , it was one of the most wealthy regions in the western world , and yet , the bysantic culture lost they were already losing after the arab invasions and those were successful because christians in the levant and egypt preferred to pay jizya over being persecuted for being the wrong type of christians ( namely monophysite and miaphysite ) , which the arabs did n't give a fuck about since they only cared about the money , and just being a battleground for the byzantine war with the persians . 
  ( persians lost even faster for similar reasons btw ) [ 1 ] then came the crusades which fucked them over , especially the fourth crusade and in the 15th century nobody was helping them anymore . 
   colonial cutlures in africa were more attractive than native african cultures and yet , colonial cultures had to withdraw . 
  i do n't know , being exploited does n't sound like fun to me . 
   if the dynamic of the demographic trends wo n't change , sooner or later , european cultures will be gone . 
  this is not hysteria . 
  this is math . 
  they said the same about the catholics and the usa and the catholics ( irish and italians ) became american after a while .
