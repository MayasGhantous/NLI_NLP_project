but the spanish government are retards yup , they are a bunch of retards for trying to protect their country 's economy and territory , even if it 's at the expense of a bunch of people . 
  wait , so how does getting seats work ? 
  i 'm following it ( thanks to / u/araknite ) and with the way things are standing now jxs\u00ed has 39.36 % of the votes , yet they 'd get 63 seats , which is 46.67 % of the seats . 
  how does that work ? 
  edit : and now they have 39.45 % of the votes and lost a seat , lmfao . 
  also , thank you everyone who responded . 
  where can i follow this ? 
   with that logic russia can claim donetsk and luhansk not according to the most recent census from 2001 . 
  58 % of luhank 's population is ethnic ukrainian , 56.9 % of donetsk 's population is ethnic ukrainian . 
  there is . 
  crippling ukraine 's economy even more while improving that of the dpr and lpr . 
  in some oblasts definitely . 
  throughout whole ukraine ? 
  definitely not . 
  enough in those oblasts to even talk about independence ? 
  definitely not . 
  i do n't see how there 's an ethnic divide if there 's an ukrainian ethnic majority in every single oblast excluding the crimean peninsula . 
  sure the ethnic russians can be pissed off , but some people act like the population in east ukraine consists of 80 % ethnic russians . 
   considering the ethnic divide in ukraine according to the 2001 census ( ca n't find a more up to date one , but i do n't see why it would differ much ) every ukrainian oblast 's population consists of at least 56 % ethnic ukrainians or more , excluding the crimean peninsula ( 24,3 % in crimea , 22,4 % in simferopol ) . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_ukraine#ethnic_groups remember : someone 's primary language can be russian , but does n't mean that they are ethnically russian , and vice versa . 
  according to the 2001 cencus 5.5 million ethnic ukrainians speak russian as their primary language . 
  also , letting them split off from ukraine can set a dangerous precedent for future scenarios . 
  and russia will buy them from egypt the same day egypt receives them from france . 
  someone remind them that the soviet union invaded poland and annexed a part of poland , then flip them off . 
  poland should destroy every single soviet monument . 
  eu countries will most likely recognize catalonia as part of spain unless spain recognizes catalonia as independent . 
  nukes ( mutual assured destruction ) and nato have prevented ww3 . 
  landing a plane there is pretty much impossible as you 'll have to intrude either ukrainian airspace or romanian and moldovan airspace . 
  not sure why you 're getting downvoted , but you 're 100 % right . 
  as long as a region wants to join russia it 's fine , but leaving is n't possible under any condition ? 
  this would be a worldwide problem for catalonia in terms of getting recognition as independent . 
  do n't all other eu countries have a veto against new members ? 
  you can bet your ass that spain would veto it immediately . 
  maybe some , but all would be just insane because if you do that you 're simply agreeing with the russian occupation of donbass and russian annexation of crimea . 
  being friendly is quite far away from recognizing an unilateral declaration of independence from a break-away region of an economic ( eu ) and/or military ( nato ) ally . 
  no country on earth with a possible break-away region like catalonia will recognize catalonia as it 's just shooting yourself in the foot on purpose . 
  no spanish ally ( think mainly eu & nato ) will recognize it as it will certainly mean losing an ally . 
  honestly , the only thing i think about georgia is that it 's one of russia 's victims . 
  what rules ? 
  honest question . 
  should put it as close to russia as possible . 
  fuck it , put it on the border with kaliningrad and watch russia cry . 
   people are looking for any excuse to be russophobic these days no need to look for them when russia keeps throwing them right in your face . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure but i think / u/atred is referencing the way the `` separatists '' obtain their equipment . 
  according to russia everything they have is either salvaged from the battlefield or made by their own , while every well thinking human really knows where the `` separatists '' get their equipment , weaponry , ammunition and vehicles from . 
   well if you want us to move on then you should stop antagonizing russia nobody is antagonizing russia , it 's russia who has to accept its and the soviet union 's past and try to become a peaceful country , unfortunately they are n't interested in any of that . 
  they will need a government and government policy change in russia first . 
  before you know it you have a bunch of pro-russia `` separatists '' with the ability to pull equipment , vehicles , weaponry and ammunition out of their ass . 
  that 'd be up to debate . 
  i remember it being talked about with the scottish independence referendum a lot . 
  a lot of people saying they would just stay in , a lot of people saying they 'd be out and would have to re-apply . 
  edit : if catalonia would become it 's own independent state it will most likely have to re-apply for eu membership , here 's an article about scotland 's independence referendum : http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/12/barroso-doubt-scotland-eu-membership, 
  they 'll get shot down immediately . 
  just not worth the money . 
  it 's an absolute embarrassment that turkey is in nato . 
  isis on their border ? 
  they think that 's fine . 
  but as soon as they have kurds on their border they prepare an invasion . 
  who 's going to get his ass tho ? 
  i love how we need 1 muslim in the middle east waving a gun and it results a military intervention , but thousands of ( pro- ) russians on our doorstep is fine . 
  then russia will have to openly invade moldova and/or ukraine . 
  because russia will just pull the same trick again somewhere else in moldova . 
  i 'm just waiting for them to call the unification of germany a nato invasion of east-germany . 
  sup http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_annexation_of_german_territory_after_world_war_ii#bakker_schut_plan, 
  i just wonder how shit like this happens . 
  obviously the current border was agreed upon by both parties one day , and how in the hell do people agree with such a border ? 
  dutch and english , but i 'm a lot better at writing and understanding english than speaking it , but if i need to speak it i should be fine . 
  when he pulls the strings , he unfortunately is . 
  i rather have people like this rot away in a little corner of a small room for the rest of their life . 
  be careful , before he knows he has an army of russian magicians rebelling along the border with russia . 
  muslims and east europeans, 
  i want [ this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/naval_jack_of_the_netherlands.svg/158px-naval_jack_of_the_netherlands.svg.png ) now, 
   what scenario would russian military actually leave eastern ukraine ? 
  join the ~ ~ russian ~ ~ eurasian economic union, 
  your house also is n't on fire right now , or is it ? 
  you could have a livestream of military vehicles with russian insignias and russian flags crossing the ukrainian border and russia would deny it . 
  not true as well https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_%28lithuania%29, 
  we do n't need the eu for peace , nuclear weapons and nato are enough . 
  thanks for your comment / r/russia user . 
  with the way russia is acting it 's just a matter of time before someone with the proper authorization approves the shooting down of a russian jet . 
  like you already said , it was outside russia 's territorial waters 2 . 
  russia is n't the only country in the region . 
  latvia , estonia , lithuania and poland are all very close by , and all 4 are nato members . 
  it stops being a civil war the second an army completely depends on an other army . 
  without russian support this war would have been over for a long time . 
  sure , there are elements of a civil war but saying that this is an actual civil war is straight up bullshit . 
  you lost all your credibility with your first two words , well done . 
   russia : k , what do you guys want to talk about ? 
  nato : crimea is ukrainian and you guys need to pull your troops and equipment out of east ukraine russia : fuck you , the referendum in crimea was 100000000 % fully legitimate and we do n't have people and equipment in east ukraine !, 
  nato : fuck you , you do have people and equipment in east ukraine !, 
  and the referendum is crimea was n't legitimate and you know it !, 
  russia : no , fuck you !, 
  ** the end ** seriously , i do n't see how this will help at all in terms of the war in ukraine . 
  russia has been doing nothing but supporting the war all while denying it . 
  it 's time that the idiots at nato start acting accordingly and up the pressure on russia and stop talking with russia until russia shows that they want to solve the war in ukraine and the situation regarding crimea . 
  quick summary : * alberto stegemen , the journalist , freely walked into the army barracks located in oirschot . 
  all he needed was a camouflage suit to gain entry without being checked once * in 2008 he also got access to woensdrecht air base , where he even had the ability to get close to fighter aircraft * he also got access to army barracks in havelte in 2008 , and he even was able to leave the barracks using an army truck, 
  thin air , but seeing how people ca n't even point out ukraine on a map i 'm sure it 's accurate . 
  did n't vote for 2 reasons : 1 . 
  main reason : hate this referendum since it 's about an agreement 99 % of the dutch citizens do n't understand properly .
