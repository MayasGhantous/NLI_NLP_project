  if i would have voted i would have voted in favor , however that might have only helped the against side to reach the 30 % mark to make this referendum valid . 
  we 've seen this happen , if just a small part of the in favor side would have stayed home the referendum would have been invalid . 
  when people get to vote on stuff they do n't understand shit about it very well might be . 
  that 's why we vote on politicians and their parties once every few years , to take care of the things the average citizen does n't understand . 
  comments like these are why so many people hate the eu . 
  where ? 
  i do n't see it . 
  fair enough . 
  but still , it 's a fairy tale . 
  the better question is : where did you get your fairy tale about the average dutch citizen being afraid of russia from ? 
  it is , some people even see this referendum and its result as preparation for a referendum about us leaving the eu . 
  100 % of votes counted , 32.2 % turnout , 38.1 % in favor , 61.1 % , against, 
  yes , but every party and politician has indicated that they wont ratify the agreement in its current form if against wins and the 30 % mark is reached , and both have happened . 
  about : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement result : our government wont ratify the above agreement in its current form, 
  because : 1 . 
  people hate the european union 2 . 
  people do n't want more of their taxes going to other countries 3 . 
  people do n't believe this will help the dutch economy 4 . 
  people do n't believe this will help the ukrainian economy and fight against corruption, 
  amsterdam ( one of the big 4 cities ) : turnout : 26,8 % for : 52,5 % against : 46,3 %, 
  us ratifying the european union association agreement with ukraine in its current form . 
  however this referendum is simply advisory , however multiple parties have already said that they wont ratify the agreement if no wins and the 30 % turnout mark is passed . 
  210 municipalities counted , 42.3 % of votes counted , 32.2 % turnout , 37.5 % for , 61.7 % against . 
  still 180 municipalities to go . 
  34.9 % votes counted , 31.9 % turnout , 37.4 % for , 61.9 % against, 
  rotterdam ( one of the big 4 cities ) : turnout : 24,4 % for : 34,9 % against : 64 %, 
  yeah , but a lot of potential yes-voters stayed home hoping the 30 % mark wont be reached, 
  sssshhhhhh , 99 % of the no voters do n't know that , 
  ~ ~ de marne has a turnout of 114,9 % ... 
  this could be legitimately possible ( you do n't have to vote where you live ) , but it 's really high considering no other city has passed the 50 % so far . ~ ~ edit : fixed , 33,4 % turnout in de marne, 
  i know , that was very clear . 
  i think one of the organizers even said that he does n't care about ukraine but just wants to flip off the eu . 
  i guess you did . 
  this is an ** advisory ** referendum about the european union association agreement with ukraine . 
  a minimum turnout of 30 % is required for the referendum to be valid , and even if it passes the 30 % mark the government is completely free to ignore it . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's even possible , this type of referendum is limited to certain specific topics . 
  i 'm pretty sure that such a referendum would need approval from the government and ca n't be achieved with signatures like this one . 
  you can follow the results by city here : http://app.nos.nl/datavisualisatie/referendum-2016/, 
  correct, 
  [ dutch newspaper asking people to point out where ukraine is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ellztwxiytu ) the woman at 1:15 first points to germany , saying that it 's poland . 
  then she points to poland saying that it 's russia , and then she points to the czech republic saying that it 's ukraine ... lmao !,

  ] ( https://twitter.com/karabakh_mod/status/716283292060934146 ) most likely greatly exaggerated . 
  true , but i 'm just going by what international law and international recognition of nagorno-karabakh says , and those both say it 's part of azerbaijan . 
  [ the bishkek protocol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bishkek_protocol ) also says so .

  i doubt it 's true , but posting it just in case it 's true . 
  not armenia , but armenian occupied azerbaijan . 
  but it will still take hours if not days to see the real scale of this escalation .

  from wikipedia :  ... is a russian politician and political activist . 
  he is a colonel in the russian army , founder and the leader of the liberal democratic party of russia ( ldpr ) , a member of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe and was twice , in 2000 and in 2004 , elected deputy speaker of the duma . 
   nato should just make the 2 % target a requirement . 
  ca n't agree more . 
  maybe there should be some situations where you can ** temporary ** drop under it , but why should other countries take your defense seriously if not even you take your own defense seriously ? 
  my guess is that they are n't on there because no un state recognizes them , not even russia . 
  it 's missing the croatia-serbia border dispute https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia%e2%80%93serbia_border_dispute, 
  i 'm against the referendum because people are trying to make it look like an `` anti-eu '' and `` anti-ukraine 's entry into the eu '' referendum , and i bet that 's how a lot of people will vote , especially on the `` no '' side . 
  well then lock it the fuck up !, 
  not a full scale war , but russia obviously would take it to the un . 
  the un would obviously demand that turkey opens the straits , and if they do n't sanctions could follow . 
  i also would n't put it past russia to indeed attack some small turkish vessel . 
  i 'm 99 % sure that closing the turkish straits would be a breach of international law . 
   are we supposed to revile stalin and burn down all images of him ? 
  yes . 
  steenwijk - a 12 year old girl was sexually assaulted this week at a swimming pool in steenwijk . 
  the police have arrested a guy as a suspected . 
  the guy in question is a refugee with residence status . 
  the young victim was swimming on sunday at swimming pool de waterwyck when a guy grabbed her . 
  the girl and her parents immediately filed a complaint of the incident with the police . 
  if we do n't use violence on their coasts and the seas , it 's just a matter of time before we 'll have to use violence in our cities . 
  politicians need to realize this asap . 
  just leaving and having iraq fight for themselves and leaving syria like the shithole it is now also is n't going to solve a thing . 
  i would n't put it past russia to start kidnapping estonians in russia then . 
  still kinda bummed out that estonia agreed to that exchange . 
  sure , they got one of their men back but now you just know that if a russian spy gets caught again russia will just kidnap another estonian border guard or maybe some other estonian citizen . 
  how about an un peacekeeping mission along the entire frontline to stop hostilities and along the entire russian-ukrainian border to stop the flow of weaponry ?!, 
  oh wait , russia is against that for some reason ... 
   treasonous , in fact . 
  fully agree . 
  politicians who are n't fine with nuclear retaliation against a nuclear strike or traitors of the highest level . 
  never watched sputnik , only articles , youtube , tweets and stuff from rt. 
  conclusion : nothing but russian propaganda . 
  i know you can receive it on dutch tv , and i honestly wish rt and similar propaganda channels were simply banned . 
  these channels have absolutely no purpose but to stir up the european communities . 
  should include french flanders . 
  ca n't stand it , it even bothers the fuck out of me when it 's done with ads . 
  i rather see an ad in english than with some shitty dutch voice-over . 
  it 's awful . 
  south-ossetia and abkhazia . 
   ukraine will fight for crimea i honestly doubt ukraine will ever attack anything russia considers theirs . 
  you know , nuclear weaponry and stuff . 
  article you linked requires me to be a member . 
  and about the sub : yeah , and it 's idiotic as fuck . 
  if all russians started to act like the people on that sub the world would be taking nk 's talk more seriously than russia . 
  then you hit they with extremely harsh sanctions , maybe kick them out of swift .
