  one could simply say that bombing isis inside syria is an act of self-defense . 
   ** if they are endangered by them ** it 's borderline insane to ** not ** give the green light for this . 
  imagine some russian jet trying to shoot you down , and all you can do is flee while contacting people on the ground to try and get permission to defend yourself . 
  transnistria is occupied by russia 2 . 
  [ gagauzia has the right to self-determination if moldova and romania unite ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gagauzia#politics ) , nobody wants a pro-russian country wedged between moldova and ukraine , especially since said country would consist of 4 regions which are n't connected to each other 3 . 
  nobody knows how the european union would react if a european union country and non-european union country try to unite 4 . 
  huge difference in gdp ( ppp ) per capita . 
  romania 's is $ 21.916 , moldova 's is $ 5.082, 
  what ? 
  yugoslavia was its own independent country . 
  yeah , although he might very well be next . 
  he also gained quite some weight . 
  rt should be banned across the continent . 
  it 's simply a hostile propaganda channel from the russian government , nothing more , nothing less . 
  zakharchenko , putin 's biggest puppet , confirmed it . 
  and if it were n't for russia 's intervention the war in donbass would have been over in 2014 . 
  lots of cars parked everywhere . 
  i 'm all for helping small companies get their business and projects started , but giving $ 150.000 to a company like cd projekt red is bullshit imo with how well they 've done in the past and are doing currently . 
  $ 150.000 is absolutely nothing to a developer as big and successful as them , that easily could have been spend better .

  i do n't think you can post tweets as news stories on here , so i guess i 'll just leave this in here . 
  [ woman caught stuffing multiple ballots into box caught on camera ] ( https://twitter.com/sashakots/status/777466557781991424 ) . 
  a woman is clearly seen stuffing multiple ballots into a box while 2 people deliberately make sure the rest of the room ca n't see it . 
  should really make a deal about some javelins + some proper training for the army on how to use them . 
  would be great for ukraine if they had even just a few dozen launchers , that shit wreaks havoc on tanks, 
  maybe someone can answer this : is there any particular reason why kaliningrad was made a part of the russian sfsr , and not the lithuanian ssr or a completely separate republic within the soviet union ? 
  they 're only actively fighting isis when the syrian army wants to go on the offensive at some place isis is currently holding , which in recent months is pretty much not happening at all . 
  russia 's campaign in syria is n't an anti-isis campaign in any way , it 's 100 % a pro-saa campaign . 
  and still , russia gives 0 fucks about civilians . 
  incendiary bombing is a common thing ( russia 's own propaganda channel rt showed incendiary bombs under a russian plane ) and russia terror bombs aleppo on a daily basis . 
  or in short : russia will continue the war in ukraine , the occupation of crimea , do everything to destabilize the entire continent and will still give absolutely 0 fucks about civilians in syria and the uk will act like everything 's ok . 
  seriously ? 
  place the current usa army against nazi germany 's army at it 's peak and the war is over in a week . 
   is recognised by armenia only . 
  not true . 
  armenia does n't recognize nagorno-karabakh because it would be a huge obstacle to achieving permanent peace with azerbaijan , and because armenian forces occupy fast amounts of territory which does n't belong to nagorno-karabakh . 
  [ here 's a map showing nagorno-karabakh within azerbaijan and who controls what ] ( http://www.daytodaygk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/armenia-azerbaijan-karabakh.gif ), 
  i 'm not comparing hitler to putin , i 'm simply comparing 2 occupations . 
  a referendum under a foreign armed occupation . 
  here 's a question for you : if the nazis would have held a referendum in any of their occupied countries , what do you think the outcome would have been ? 
   same goes with eastern ukraine where russians are majority . 
  never heard of google , huh ? 
  according to the 2001 census 39 % of people in luhansk oblasts are ethnic russians , and in donetsk oblast it 's 38.2 % . 
  the only ukrainian oblast with a russian ethnic majority according to the 2001 census is crimea , with 58.3 % . 
  and fyi , just because someone speaks russian as their native language does n't mean they 're ethnically russian . 
  they also ca n't go through the air unless they get permission from moldova or ukraine since transnistria is landlocked . 
  my original comment was n't exactly aimed at russia 's units specifically , but more so to make the situation in transnistria so bad ( as if it is n't shit enough ) to try and make the people their demand that the russian soldiers leave , which would mean an end to the blockade . 
  i 'll edit my original comment for better clarification . 
  moldova and ukraine should just blockade the area . 
  only let food , water and whatever is needed so people do n't freeze to death in the night in , everything and everyone else does n't get access . 
  edit : i do n't mean that this blockade should be aimed at the russian units specifically , but more at the residents of transnistria . 
  if the situation there deteriorates due to a blockade because the russian army refuses to leave there 's a chance that the people in transnistria might demand that the russians leave because it would mean an end to the blockade . 
  and although it 's small , and meant just for nature purposes , do n't forget the [ marker wadden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marker_wadden ) !, 
  just shows you how ridiculous humanity has become . 
  you can kill people , but you ca n't injure people in a certain way . 
  true , but a tanking economy is something russia gives 0 shits about . 
  it never was in modern history . 
  do you know if there 's any data on what used to be west and east germany ? 
  would n't surprise me if there 's quite a difference between the 2 . 
  ** if ** russia does indeed officially launches an invasion into ukraine i wonder what will happen with the russian soldiers in moldova . 
  those soldiers being used could draw moldova and maybe even moldovan allies such as romania into the war with the objective to clear russian troops out of moldova . 
  or [ the gleiwitz incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ), 
  yeah , looks like it 's actually gon na happen this time . 
  the russian fsb just officially accused the ukrainian army of an armed incursion into crimea : http://tass.ru/en/politics/893518 russia only has 1 problem : the average toddler is better at lying and making shit up than they are . 
  there 's absolutely no reason to believe that any ukrainian will get a fair trial . 
  the only party not interested in peace is russia and their puppets . 
  what a load of bs, 
  probably , just like the assassination attempt on one of russia 's highest ranked puppets in the east . 
  unfortunately our retarded politicians still do n't realize that russian expansionism will continue unless you send back enough russian thugs in coffins . 
  at the moment the only question is : which country is russia 's next victim ? 
  not even the country occupying the place recognizes it . 
  enough said . 
   our merger with the dutch military is finally paying off . 
  we 're also scheduled to get a bit bigger in 2017 ( article is in dutch but there 's a video with english subtitles at the bottom ) : http://www.limburg.nl/actueel/nieuws_en_persberichten/2016/juni_2016/belgische_en_nederlandse_partners_leggen_afspraken_grenscorrectie_vast_in_memorandum_van_overeenstemming we 're getting about 0.1328 square kilometer bigger, 
  good, 
  the ukrainian army wont go on the offensive because russia will just push back . 
  sending lethal aid to ukraine would have 1 purpose : make the war more costly in terms of money spend , equipment losses and casualties for russia . 
  every war has a price , and that price is n't always simply completely defeating an army . 
  also , people in occupied areas wont get tired and find a compromise . 
  just look at transnistria , abkhazia and south ossetia . 
  russia will simply fund the economy of occupied ukraine like they 're doing in those areas . 
   if the russian parts want to secede , it 's should be considered exercising the right of self determination ( or do we not believe in that anymore ) . 
  no , i and nobody should believe in the right of self determination when : 1 . 
  the area which wants to secede tries to do so with violence 2 . 
  the country supporting the area which wants to secede ( russia in this case ) does n't allow separatism within its own borders in any way not to mention that the war in the east would have been over for a long time if russia did n't intervene when the ukrainian army was kicking the real separatists ' asses . 
  also , a fair referendum would be impossible due to the years of propaganda , suppression of pro-ukrainian parties and displaced people . 
  forgot the / s mate . 
   what is spain going to do ? 
  what 's catalonia gon na do if spanish diplomats go into catalonia ? 
  arrest them ? 
  turn them back ? 
  at that point you 're effectively a rebellion . 
   as for the eu . 
  why does catalonia have to be in the eu ? 
  the uk is leaving . 
  not even comparable to the slightest . 
  if catalonia declares independence on their own they can say goodbye to all eu trade , and a blockade could very well happen . 
  you really think spain and the eu will just allow that ? 
  and if they voted for independence , then what ? 
  he refers to the ukrainian army as ukrops and nazis , and he 's obviously only taking question from idiots who think the same way .
