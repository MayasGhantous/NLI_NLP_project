  fuck off with this propaganda . 
  this is just big talk from kerry . 
  turkey is wayyyyy too important due to its geographical location . 
  also , they have a big army , turkey has more active personnel than france , the uk and germany combined .

  because russia stronk, 
   the battalions are supposed to be multinational yeah , we 're sending 100 to 150 soldiers to lithuania . 
   we have to seriously ask ourselves how willing the uk and france would be to go to war over , say , estonia . 
  if they are n't willing to do that they should leave nato . 
  the day a nato members gets invaded and other nato members do n't help fighting off the invasion is the day nato should be dissolved . 
  he 's simply getting out hoping his and david cameron 's successors will get all the shit for what 's to come . 
   it is their tournament . 
  it is their tournament ** inside ** the stadium . 
  i guarantee it that if you 'd take a punishment for riots inside the city to the cas you 'd have your punishment nullified . 
  uefa ca n't hand out punishments for stuff which happens outside the stadium . 
  when feyenoord hooligans rioted in rome the uefa did n't punish us for 1 simple reason : it did n't happen in the stadium or at the ground directly next to the stadium . 
  what happens outside of the stadium is the french security forces ' problem , not uefa 's . 
  for those who do n't speak dutch : it looks like the jet crashed due to a mid-air collision . 
  another swiss jet has damage near the tail . 
  i 'd like to see one with serious separatist movements . 
  stuff like frisia is really nothing serious in terms of independence . 
  meanwhile russian and belarusian airborne forces held drills in brest 2 months ago , and brest is literally against the polish border . 
  so nato having drills in the middle of poland undermines trust , but russia and belarus having drills near a city which is on the border with poland does n't ? 
  if the us wanted conflict with russia they could just bomb russia 's occupation forces in moldova , georgia and ukraine , which also would be totally legal at the request of those countries by the way . 
  this picture was already in october 's report ( page 82 ) : http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/uploads/phase-docs/1006/debcd724fe7breport-mh17-crash.pdf, 
  i wonder how you 'd react if greece soldiers where dying while fighting off an invasion into greece . 
  it 's such a shame that the ukrainian armed forces do n't have the proper backing from western militaries . 
  it 's as obvious as it gets that russia is trying to provoke ukraine into an offensive , just so they can fight that offensive off , declare minsk 2 dead and go on the offensive themselves . 
  yeah , should have gone for east frisia and left it at that . 
  i guess that 's because everyone who can and wants to gets the fuck out of there does so . 
  based on the 2014 population estimate transnistra had a population decline of 9.04 % in 10 years . 
  between the 1989 census and the 2004 census transnistria had a population decline of 18.33 % . 
  in total that 's a 25.71 % population decline in 25 years . 
  i assume that the same will happen to the oblast ? 
  all nato members just signed the accession protocol !, 
  technically speaking it 's 104km/h here since there 's a 3 % correction . 
  3 % of 104 = 3.12 which is then rounded up to 4 . 
  thanks to the correction you could drive 103km/h because that 'd become 99km/h after the correction . 
  already killed 3 ukrainian soldiers yesterday which is unusually high . 
  what about the arrest and prosecution of all people involved ? 
  kinda bullshit to say that while we do n't have an official threshold . 
  one thing danish people are almost always really good at is learning dutch . 
  quite a lot of danish football players who 're active or were active here speak dutch almost perfectly . 
  a player like ajax 's sch\u00f6ne could easily pass as someone born and raised here, 
  such a painful election for the pvda . 
  [ look at all the municipalities they won in 2012 ( they 're in red ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/tweede_kamerverkiezingen_2012.png/1200px-tweede_kamerverkiezingen_2012.png ) . 
  the 2010 coalition consisted of the vvd ( 31 seats ) , cda ( 21 seats ) with support from the pvv ( 24 seats ) for a total of 76 seats . 
  in 2012 mark rutte ( vvd 's leader ) and geert wilders ( pvv 's leader ) could n't agree on 2013 's budget , causing the pvv to withdraw its support which caused the coalition to fall and resign , which triggered new elections . 
   the gert party did they get more seats or less ? 
  5 more than in 2012 , 4 less than in 2010 . 
  new prognosis after 365 of 388 municipalities ' votes have been counted : vvd : 33 pvv : 20 cda : 19 d66 : 19 groenlinks : 14 sp : 14 pvda : 9 cu : 5 pvdd : 5 50 + : 4 sgp : 3 denk : 3 fvd : 2, 
  the pvv has gone from 20,4 % to 19,9 % in wilders ' birthplace venlo . 
  new prognosis after 54,8 % of votes have been counted : vvd : 32 cda : 19 pvv : 19 d66 : 19 groenlinks : 15 sp : 14 pvda : 9 cu : 6 pvdd : 5 50 + : 4 sgp : 3 denk : 3 fvd : 2 exactly the same as both the exit polls except for the vvd and groenlinks . 
  the vvd has 1 more seat than the exit polls and groenlinks 1 less . 
  lmao . 
  you doubt the exit polls yet you confirm that the exit polls are right in the same comment . 
  the same exit polls you 're talking about show the vvd losing 10 seats , so of course they 're down in votes . 
  exit polls are very reliable in the netherlands . 
  at most they 'll be off by 2 seats per party , anything more than that would be quite the surprise . 
  votes slowly starting to come in now , 6 municipalities in the last ~ 15 minutes . 
  according to the exit polls those 3 parties have 69 seats , not 76 +, 
  high turnout and all votes are counted by hand . 
  good weather ( not even joking , that increases turnout with about 1 % apparently ) , and people being scared of the pvv ( wilder 's party ) getting too big , especially after brexit and trump becoming president . 
  also , it 's high when you compare it to 2012 and 2010 . 
  in 2003 we had a turnout of 80 % and in 2006 80,4 % . 
  turnout simply took a huge dive in 2010 ( 75,4 % ) and 2012 ( 74,6 ) . 
  doubt anyone would give a shit if brexit and trump being president were n't a thing . 
  the best thing is that they were so convinced the pvv would win by a landslide that they made a stickied post about the elections . 
  a few minutes after the exit polls were in they quickly removed the sticky . 
  i 'm not sure how it works there . 
  people in bonaire , sint eustatius and saba vote today . 
  73 % voter turnout at 19:45 , in 2012 it was at 65 % . 
  already nearing 2012 's final voter turnout which was at 74,6 % . 
  69 % voter turnout at 19:15 . 
  in 2012 it was at 60 % . 
  turnout at 15:45 was at 43 % , in 2012 it was at 37 % . 
  personally i 'm not a fan of having a 2nd round , but i would n't mind seeing a threshold , although i think going from 0,67 % to 5 % might be a bit too much of a jump , maybe a 2 % threshold would be a good start . 
  denk might as well just change their name to apk . 
  new poll from i & o research . 
  [ a special police unit arrived just over half an hour ago ] ( http://nos.nl/video/2162686-speciale-politie-eenheid-arriveert.html ), 
  turkey wants to campaign here for their upcoming referendum about the power erdogan has . 
  they call turks in the netherlands * turkish state citizens * which pisses off pretty much every politician in the netherlands and our government starts seeing if there 's a way they can legally block turkish government officials from having a rally here . 
  they schedule a rally in the backyard of a consulate and start asking people eligible to vote to show up , which is against our government 's wishes because we 're afraid the rally could get too big . 
  suddenly turkey threatens us with sanctions while talks about having a rally were ongoing , causes or government to revoke landing permissions for the plane containing the turkish minister of foreign affairs . 
  turkey gets pisses , we 're nazis , bla bla bla . 
  then some turkish official from germany goes to rotterdam for a rally , road blocks are put up around the turkish consulate in rotterdam and the turkish official is stopped . 
  they control the bosphorus , are the gate to the middle east ( turkey borders syria , iraq and iran ) and they have quite a big army . 
  in my opinion russia is simply trying to force ukraine to escalate the war . 
  first they recognize documents used in occupied territory and a part of occupied territory will use russia 's currency , something which you ca n't do unless enough bank notes and coins are delivered or printed , because these things do n't just appear out of thin air . 
  this is simply a de-facto annexation . 
  [ video from inside the building ] ( https://twitter.com/ryskeldisatke/status/829297160948690944 ), 
   i mean , what can they do ? 
  on the left side of the page it says `` today '' . 
  it definitely does , but a war is obviously worth more if you 're the one being attacked . 
  simply sending enough russian solders home in a coffin or blown to pieces . 
  unlike what some people think you do n't have to kill their entire army or capture moscow , you simply have to make it too costly . 
   if some people are not willing to understand us oh it 's pretty easy to understand russia . 
  russia is still stuck with the 20th century mentality where europe ** has ** to be divided in 2 spheres of influence : 1 led by russia and consisting of former soviet union republics and other countries in eastern-europe and 1 led by the usa and consisting of western-european countries . 
  and if a country tries to leave their sphere of influence russia will just invade them . 
  first moldova , then georgia , then ukraine and fuck knows what country is next .
