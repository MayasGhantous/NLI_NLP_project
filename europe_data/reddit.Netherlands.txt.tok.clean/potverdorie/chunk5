  there should be some world championship of guttural sounds and it 'd be a photo finish each year between you , us , and the german swiss . 
  oh , so that 's why the hollanders are n't considered to speak a dialect !, 
  poor guys , i did n't realise it was medical . 
  sounds like it could be a pretty good unofficial motto for europe !, 
  neither does it mention the glorious stellingwerfs dialect by name !, 
  this is obviously some grand conspiracy by those elitist clay frisians to push their dreadful standard frisian on everyone . 
  friso-saxon aliv in stellingwarven, 
  yeah , flevolanders speak just about the most generic dutch . 
  and then you enter urk and everyone speaks some utterly unintelligible saxon dialect . 
  / u/dimetrans implied that the * real * queen was replaced after a visit to china in 1986 . 
  which , in case you 're wondering , obviously did n't happen . 
  it did n't happen so much that it 's hilariously absurd to even suggest it . 
  so that was the joke , now officially ruined because it had to be explained . 
  too recent . 
  she still remembers the wars that split pangea . 
  when the italians or the spanish do n't speak english it 's because they 're romance speakers that understandably have difficulty with english , when the french do n't speak english it 's because they 're arrogant and rude . 
  along the coast of argentina , just think of the advantages !, 
  * no longer part of europe * still far away from the usa and those other colonial types * the falkland isles are now part of britain proper so argentina can shut the hell up * nicer weather * continent closeby you can visit , get roaringly drunk , get ridiculously sunburnt , and laugh at the locals with their silly languages, 
  not with that attitude !, 
   daughter `` so do they dance together then ? '', 
  asking the real important questions . 
  very nice to see that the tide for regional languages is turning . 
  one of the few who perpetuate the stereotype of the arrogant frenchman . 
  seems pretty lazy to just take a screengrab from google earth . 
  that used to happen every day until we built our dykes . 
  had the exact same reaction . 
  well , griekenland , you know what to do !, 
  frietjes are those small oily things they serve in american fastfood chains . 
  they tried to because the french had the audacity not to join the iraq war , despite the indisputable evidence for chemical weapons ^ ^ / s , and some warmongers decided that the french were therefore the enemy . 
  bmi is n't very useful on an individual level , but very useful on a population level . 
  on the other hand , i like to imagine everyone in the uk is just swole as fuck brah . 
  and that report pulled their data from [ this report ] ( http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/148114/1/9789241564854_eng.pdf ) ; page 232-239 . 
  this map is n't based on the data from the global database on bmi , but rather from [ this who report ] ( http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/148114/1/9789241564854_eng.pdf ) . 
  the relevant bits about the data collection can be read on page 138 , but to summarize : these are adjusted estimates based on aggregated data provided to who and collaborators . 
  data were included based on several inclusion criteria and adjusted to account for various differences between countries , such as age/sex structure of the population . 
  they also analysed the statistical uncertainty of their estimates , which are presented on page 232-239 , but these ranges were unfortunately not included on this map , even though they would be rather informative . 
  it 's even happening along the baltic sea though . . 
  it seems like coasts tend to have a slightly better solar potential - what causes this ? 
  those red sandstone bricks have a very similar colour as the default bricks used in [ many dutch houses ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zpmd1ew.jpg ) , so my first impression on seeing those photos was that it did n't look too much out of the ordinary . . on the other hand , i get way too excited at seeing * any * regular old french village simply because the colouring and building style of the houses is so different than what i grew up with . 
  funny how our preconceived notions can affect our first impressions so much . 
  [ these kind of constructions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tautological_place_names ) happen more often actually . 
  het haagse bos is n't listed there yet though !, 
   as the rest of europe ? 
  we vote exclusively on weekdays here in the netherlands , mostly on wednesdays . 
  you can vote from early in the morning until late in the evening , and there 's voting booths all over the place , even on places like central stations , and it never took more than 15 minutes for me . 
  unless you 're working a 16 hour shift without any breaks exactly during the election time , everyone is covered and has an opportunity to vote . 
  the rationale behind the wednesday is for a number of reasons : * sabbath and the sunday rest , but also drinking , might impact voting during the weekends * monday is inconvenient as preparations for the elections would have to be carried out over the weekend * children often get a half day off from primary school on wednesday , and especially in villages many schools host voting booths . 
  pure speculation , but i think it might come down to three main factors : 1 . 
  biking culture , the obvious one . 
  thanks to a small , flat , densely populated country with good infrastructure it 's easy for people to just grab their bike when they want to go somewhere , which is a great way to promote an active lifestyle . 
  easy access to high quality food . 
  the availability , quality and affordability of nutritious food products is very high in the netherlands and was rated the highest in europe last year . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/15/us-food-countries-idusbrea0e01s20140115 ) . 
  likely also a result of our infrastructure , as well as being a transportation hub , giving all inhabitants easy access to fresh and healthy food products . 
  homecooking culture , dutch people do n't eat out as much as many other cultures around the world . 
  people generally only go out to eat if there 's a special occassion for it . 
  hurray for calvinism i guess ? 
  even lunch is prepared at home and taken to work by the vast majority of dutch people . 
  combined with an increasing understanding of a healthy diet and the availability of high quality ingredients leads to healthy meals . 
  we 've got some pretty unhealthy characteristics too , given our traditional cuisine being a lot of fried food and baked sweets , but apparently those are compensated for by other factors . 
  what would jesus do ? 
  makes you wonder if this is used as an argument against the eu by french eurosceptics or as an argument for the eu by french europhiles . 
  thanks !, 
  i think it could be a very nice place to have a wedding ceremony for couples that seek a balance between appreciating catholic and modern values ; same-sex or interreligious weddings , for example . 
  especially with those beautiful surroundings and the astounding effect of sunset . 
  that 's a very cool visual effect !, 
  does anyone know if it has been used as a real church for mass or weddings ? 
  immigrants , coming from sweden , and the eu , which sweden is a part of . 
  i think not . 
  yeah , it 's interesting how in dutch the difference between those sounds was lost while it 's still present in german , frisian and some low saxon dialects . 
  our `` ch '' is a little bit softer than yours , i 've yet to hear anything beat the raw guturral sounds you can hear in southern holland . 
  and our `` g '' is often pronounced like the english do . 
  immigrants from the dutch antilles are christian while immigrants from suriname are predominantly christian or hindu . 
  both of these group have problems integrating in dutch society . 
  for example , after correction for socio-economic circumstances , antillian immigrants are the most likely to be involved with criminal behaviour out of non-western immigrant groups , followed by morrocans , surinamese and then turkish . 
  the rebellion was definitely very alive in what is now belgium , the beeldenstorm initiated in flanders and then spread throughout the rest of the low countries . 
  although they did n't manage to obtain independence it 's fair to say they were part of the rebellion for sure . 
   muh heritage i do n't even have - stra or - ma as my last name . . 
  i 'll have to make do with a frisian first name and a frisian flair on reddit :'(, 
  all we have to do is find someone called peter who is tall , that should n't be too hard, 
   if you 're born in belgium you 're belgian i think they 're still running tests in cern to find evidence that the elusive belgian really exists , so far they 've only found the derivative fleming and walloon particles . 
  we 're totally oppressed !, 
  just the other day i spoke to a west-fleming and he called me a hollander , stomping all over my proud ethnic identity . 
  it 's like we 're * literally * back in pre-civil war america . 
  you 're a heterosexual cisgender eurocrat-privileged shitlord who 's oppressing a proud , independent ethnic minority !, 
  but i like that definition you found too . 
  beware of the french-dutch hybrid offspring ~ ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u0361 \u00b0 \u035f\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ~, 
  being called a hollander is my trigger , you awful heterocis-fleming scum . 
  it seems you are completely unaware of the fact that frisians have an ironic meta-selfawareness sense of humour where everything we say or do is part of a post-modernist deconstruction of comedy as an institution . 
  you silly goose !, 
  ohoho , do n't you have egg on your face now , obviously / u/yaix was making a hilarious eurogermanic wisecrack where he tells people with a porto region brand of portugese humour to calm down . 
  what a thigh slapper !,
