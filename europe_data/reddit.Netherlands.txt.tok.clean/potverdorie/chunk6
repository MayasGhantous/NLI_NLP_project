  ** n ** : in 2012 she was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour . 
  since then , isa has been fighting for her life . 
  it seemed like the little girl was going to conquer the cancer . 
  until the beginning of this year . 
  ** m ** : we went back to the hospital and it turned out , it had gone completely bad . 
  the judgement was , there is nothing we can do . 
  your whole world falls apart then , you do n't know what to do , you think `` how can this be possible , our child , this ca n't happen , this should n't happen . '', 
  ** n ** : despite all the tragedy , isa 's parents try not to allow too many emotions . 
  that 's better for isa , but also for her eight year old sister suus . 
  isa ca n't play anymore , it costs too much energy . 
  but opening envelopes still goes fine . 
  ** m ** : she finds a lot of joy in that . 
  for the rest , she just sits on the couch , and she just ca n't do a lot anymore . 
  but she can still open envelopes , and of course look at the cards and she really enjoys that . 
  ** n ** : the call on the facebook page of omroep gelderland already reached over 200,000 people . 
  hundreds of readers have pledged to send isa a postcard . 
  all these boxes are meant for isa . 
  ** m ** : people ask us , how do you cope , well , through things like this , we can cope . 
  it is so heartwarming to see how people cooperate . 
  and of course we have two children , and we need to remain strong for both of them , and that 's what we do . 
  ** n ** : would you also like to send a card to isa ? 
  please visit our website for the address . 
  just be mindful to put it in an envelope , as it 's been mentioned she likes that the most . 
  as he said himself , he 's `` a product of both sides '' . 
  in other words , he 's one of the most mythical beings in all of belgium : an actual belgian !, 
  you 've convinced me . 
  the fact that french is the lingua franca in brussels is definite proof that brussels should n't be the capital of the eu . 
  i guess it was n't obvious enough : that was mostly tongue-in-cheek . 
   i 'm sure that there 's very good reasons for it all existing . 
  mostly all the different levels of governments , parliaments , municipalities and the varying degrees of cooperation between them . 
  all in one city !, 
  that 's why i think brussels is the perfect city to be the capital of the eu . 
  everyone speaks a different language , it 's completely subdivided in various arbitrary regions , there 's a whole lot of completely unnecessary bureaucracy going on for no apparent reason , no one is really sure what a true brusselaar/bruxellois is , no one is sure what language they should speak in any given situation , multiple regions feel they have a claim over it , and somehow it all kind of works out . 
  it 's a microcosm of the eu itself !, 
  kankah tyfus , het is zow errug lekker gezellug it probably does n't help that my accent is fairly neutral when speaking dutch . 
  i 'd support an annexation of flanders just so * you bastards will stop calling us that * . 
  yeah , the only people i 've found to be ruder than the hollanders are the flemings who have mistaken me for a hollander . 
  and that is no small feat !, 
   it 's mostly foreigners that seem to think it would be a good idea by simply based on language . 
  muh nation state, 
  not necessary , if for some reason the netherlands became inhabitable we 'd just polder up a new one somewhere in the middle of the north sea . 
  the faroese always seemed a bit lonely , let 's give them some company !, 
  are n't those three dots all up in the north in sami territory ? 
  there is no amount of scientific data that would get the brits to admit they share anything with the french other than historic animosity and the english channel . 
  we have to go back further !, 
  let 's split up into tribal regions governed by [ things ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thing_%28assembly%29 ) again . 
   * how the innkeeper is , so does he trust his guests . 
  yeah , really weird , he 's even published in virological journals in the early '90s . 
  how he turned into an aids/measles denier , i have n't the faintest . 
  that 's the thing about science though - scientists themselves are only human , prone to mistakes and opinions . 
  the scientific method as a whole manages to weed that out as much as it can . 
  people here generally do n't make a habit of walking around with meat cleavers or guns . 
  gosh , it 's almost like the scientific community has a better idea of what 's going on than a bunch of fringe conspiracy types . 
  nah , you 'd get it wrapped in paper in a little plastic basket in those american diner-styled places or just on a plate in any other restaurant . 
  wooden boards are n't that common unless it 's for a cheese platter . . or the restaurant is trying to be all hipster-rustic . 
  unfortunately not !, 
  i had the opportunity to have a bison burger when i was visiting the us last year , absolutely delicious , i love that gamey taste . 
  we do have beef from wild scottish highlanders , although i have n't had it as a burger yet . 
  burgers are pretty great . 
  a lot of europeans also do n't really understand what a proper hamburger is like and just think of crummy macdonalds stuff . 
  we start seeing american diner-style hamburger joints , selling burgers with original ingredients and quality beef , opening up around the netherlands now , and they 're getting damned popular . 
  herring , onion , potato , dark bread , and strong liquor . 
  that 's some proper northern european food . 
  * angrily shakes fist in the general direction of finland *, 
  seriously , i 'm having a real hard time thinking of a french dish without ample amounts of butter or oil . 
  maybe a baguette with nothing on it ? 
  did anyone else buy that stoofpeertjesstroop they had during the winter season at albert heijn ? 
  oh my god , so good, 
  [ apparently it exists ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bxm5rks.png ) i 'd eat that in a heartbeat really, 
  it would be so weird if someone actually pronounced pannen-koeken . 
  rookworst without r is also sausage wait . . 
  just add a few spoonfuls of groninger mustard to your andijviestamp and feel your sinuses open up wide . 
  i 'm sure !, 
  but i 've never had the privilege , and i do n't like my chances of it happening anytime soon ... 
  snert is the perfect food to warm you up on a cold and rainy winter day . 
  in der deed . 
  real talk though : i 've had a bunch of jenevers in belgium , but most of the time they 're more like fruity liquors rather than the strong bitters we call jenever here in the netherlands . 
  always struck me as odd . 
  that 's because they 're not meant to be bitter themselves , but to be eaten while enjoying a nice bitter jenever . 
  even our ` bland ' stuff can be really good even without spices , we 've got great stews , oven dishes and soups . 
  i 've convinced plenty foreign friends of the virtues of dutch cuisine with my stoofpeertjes , aspergeschotel or mosterdsoep . 
  like / u/vlepun mentioned already , dutch cuisine is only bland if you 're doing it wrong . 
  that * is * typical dutch food , but it 's not generally sold in restaurants or fastfood places because to us it does n't make sense to eat the same thing in a restaurant as what you 'd eat at home . 
  i 'm from the stellingwarven so my low saxon is actually a bit better than my klaaifrysk . 
  it 's pretty cool that there 's people translating stuff to regional languages , i once got a suske & wiske in drents . 
  let 's not forget our cute little cousin low saxon and make it five !, 
  american cuisine has some pretty decent meals ( jambalaya , the various bbq styles , tex-mex ) but most americans give up after figuring out how to make mac & cheese . 
  half a million is a pretty decent number of people . 
  europeans tend to be way more metrosexual than americans so i wonder what he 's on about . 
  there 's also a decent number of people who speak both dutch and frisian . 
  it 's weird to see the difference between national subreddits , / r/sweden is rather rightwing whereas / r/thenetherlands tends towards the left , while i 'm sure the demographics of the people from those countries who are on reddit are roughly comparable . 
  the disease itself , he died at home surrounded by his family . 
  komkommer and augurk are used for different cultivars within the same plant species . 
  we only use komkommer for cucumber . 
  rutger never plays fair , that 's his schtick . 
  i think it 's very clear that the spokesman is trying to say that they have easter on half their products and that they 're not going to change over some ridiculous ` outrage ' no matter what side it 's coming from , because no matter what you do you 're going to offend someone . 
  either way , this interview can obviously barely be taken as proof that they 're somehow pc because he does n't even get half a chance to properly explain himself or say what he wants to say , so you can take what he says either way . 
  but if hema really wanted to be pc they would n't have easter plastered all over half their products , do n't be ridiculous . 
  yeah , if you completely ignore what he 's saying and just take half a sentence out of context like rutger , who is trolling as he always does . 
  what he actually said is that people are going to be offended * no matter what you do * .
