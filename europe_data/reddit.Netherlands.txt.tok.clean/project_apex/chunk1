saudi-arabia is hitting 3 birds ( iran nuke deals , russia in syria , us shale gas ) with one stone by lowering the price . 
   saudi arabia will force the price of oil down , in an effort to put political pressure on iran and russia , according to the president of saudi arabia oil policies and strategic expectations center [ click ] ( http://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/402343--saudi-arabia-to-pressure-russia-iran-with-price-of-oil ), 
  as the continent with ( arguably ) the most beautiful architecture and monuments i think we should design some fake bridges and put that on our money to symbolize our lack of harmony . 
  edit : i know they do n't see themselves as europe but : [ the houses of parliament ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_westminster ) . 
  it 's where parliamentary democracy was born , so i guess it symbolizes a lot . 
  and it 's a beautiful building !, 
  maastricht : birthplace of the euro !, 
  ( and our new vice president of the eu commission ), 
  netherlands 1 eur = 2,1 dutch guilder . 
  aah , i remember going to italy on vacation and getting 1000 lira as pocket money . 
  i felt so rich ... until i entered the store . 
  parents laughing there asses off . . 
  my grandma still does this sometimes . 
  but she uses it more as a way of complaining about how ` expensive everything has become ' while conveniently forgetting 10 years of inflation since the euro 's introduction . 
  yeah , the southern part of our country has been in open rebellion since around ~ 1830 . 
  we beat the fins at something ? 
  omg !, 
  omg we beat finland at math !, 
  suck it , finland !, 
  shut up and fix my plumbing . 
  deciding wether a municipality or the national government does something is different than shifting banking regulation to a supranational , non-elected government that represents 500 million + people . 
  the eu is further away from its own citizens and its own citizens ' needs and wishes than the u.s. congress . 
   that tipping is almost never done here in france the tip is 8 % and it \u00b4 s included in the price you see on the menu in many places in france . 
  that being said , in nl some people tip but usually not more than 5 % or 10 % . 
  i almost never do it but that is mainly because i rarely use cash anymore . 
  i think it is a step forward that after a civilised debate about the future of the union we voted for a transfer of soevereignity to the eu . 
  i mean , it is not like the eu is our future and not holding a vote on matters like this will cause deeply rooted resentment about the eu and the euro for decades to come . 
   plus we do n't suffer from `` white man 's guilt '' . 
  we do n't either . 
  why ? 
  it is russian ... maybe not by right or by law , but they have actual control over it . 
  why else would cameron make such a clown of himself after hearing it . 
  if he did n't kick and scream like a child the ukip support would probably be even higher . 
  it is the same as in every debate . 
  radical lunatics on both sides seem to have the biggest bullhorns while the reasonable middle is ignored . 
  ca n't believe how many times i 've seen this headline in one form ot another the past years ... next !, 
  you mean : 9/12 would vote again ? 
  . co.uk and not the guardian . 
  not even worth reading if it 's about continental europe . 
  they do , he was n't charged or anything . 
  but the cops who saw him hitting his kid did n't know at first that he was the ambassador and when they learned it they favoured the kid 's right to not be beaten over the ambassadors immunity . 
  the cops were wrong , technically , but the crown expelled the ambassador . 
  kicking out the ambassador does n't mean that you close their embassy . 
  they would just be forced to send a new ambassador . 
  although , we once arrested the russian ambassador for hitting his kid ( while drunk ) and it certainly did n't improve our relationship ... 
  why has n't ireland kicked the embassador out ? 
  something in the back of my head screams that this is n't the first time the israeli embassy in ireland did something like this ... brb , going to google . 
  oh , i did n't know that . 
  guess we 'll need to swap to . uni or so some day . 
  i do n't . . is it like a bonus ? 
  i think in nl you only get vacation money in may ( 8 % ), 
  http://uk.eu - it 's a sign . 
  . edu is for education and can be used by any uni around the world . 
  my e-mail has a . edu tld . 
  www.torrentz.eu is * literally * the only one i know . 
  but we are really getting off topic here : are british children safe now online ? 
  weird , a friend of mine who moved to london said he had to specifically opt-out of the filter during the signup process . 
  do n't they block it by default when signing up for an isp ? 
  `` no , this porn filter is not the beginnen of internet censorship in the uk , it 's just the government protecting kids . '', 
  - the uk government . 
  so , the netherlands has 2 ? 
  i am proud that , as a citizen of the eu , i can vote for people like this to represent me in our european parliament . 
  never heard of him . 
  probably just some politician that needed to be promoted out national politics because of politics . 
  besides the chairman , finance and foreign affairs these eu commissions are jokes anyway . 
   these countries will do fine for now . 
  but they 're too small to achieve certain things . 
  research , space travel or medical treatments are all easier for larger countries . 
  so you think research ( south korea is the [ most innovative ] ( http://images.businessweek.com/bloomberg/pdfs/most_innovative_countries_2014_011714.pdf ) country in the world btw ) , space travel and medical treatment ( switzerland is consistently ranked highest in this ) are worth to hand over your countries self-government to a huge federal body overseeing 500 million people ? 
  besides the fact that your argument makes so sense i do n't think we should do it . 
   do you think a singapore could go into space ? 
  but the esa can . 
  thank you for this . 
  the esa is the * perfect * example of why we ** do not ** need a federal eu to achieve great things . 
  the esa works * completely * outside the eu . 
  even norway and switzerland are members ( canada is an associate member ) . 
  the esa works on the basis of co\u00f6peration between nations , just like i think the eu should . 
   the larger a country is the more potential it has to achieve great things , and ** the more power it will have in world politics ** . 
  the more power a country has , the more lucrative it becomes to hold that power . 
  look at the u.s. congress and the u.s. military . 
  besides domestic politics , internationally the military consistently serves the purpose of the people in power , not the country . 
  all throughout history , nations that have had great armies * have used them * . 
  i do not want this for the eu . 
   do you think any of the smaller european nations would have anything to say in world politics if they were n't part of the eu ? 
  you mean france and britian having 2 veto powers ? 
  you mean germany being invited to the iran negotiations ? 
  or are you talking about the say that countries like the netherlands have ? 
  because if it 's the latter then i do n't know if you are being serious right now . 
  no , the netherlands alone has nothing to say in global politics . 
  but if the way the eu ` handled ' the debt crisis says anything about the future , then we 'll have even less to say in the foreign policy of the eu . 
  that 's what the politicians keep repeating and repeating until people think its a fact . 
  `` we need the eu to have budget powers '' . 
  `` we need a banking union '' . 
  `` we need a strong eu '' . 
  i do n't buy it though , singapore does great , switzerland does great , south korea does great . 
  all without being part of a huge federal system . 
  well , in my defense , the question was what * my country * should change about it relationship / behaviour towards the eu . 
  we should stop allowing the eu to take small steps towards a federal eu . 
  one small step after the other is taken to avoid the debate around it . 
  i 'm not agianst a strong eu per s\u00e9 .
