  wow . 
  hope you pass it the first time . 
  good luck, 
   the idea that he 's got democratic legitimacy is ridiculous . 
  exaclty . 
  in nl only [ 37 % ] ( http://www.parlement.com/id/vhx1b38yhhwz/opkomst_europese_verkiezingen_in ) voted in the election ... 
  in nl only [ 5 % ] ( https://decorrespondent.nl/1352/jean-claude-juncker-is-alles-wat-er-mis-is-met-europa-in-n-persoon/81338076248-83bffcae ) knows him . 
  in europe this is [ 8 % ] ( http://www.eureporter.co/magazine/2014/06/04/new-poll-destroys-jean-claude-junckers-mandate-says-aecr/ ) . 
  yeah , nice democracy you got there . 
  read this article in der spiegel : [ click ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15317086.html ) . 
  for those who do n't speak german : when asked how the eu will be build he ( litterally ) says : `` we decide something . 
  then we announce it . 
  we wait a while . 
  when no one complains , because people do n't know what we decided anyway , we continu - step by step until there is no way back '' . 
  yeah . 
  the cameron is 100 % correct about this guy . 
  really ? 
  first try ? 
  when would your resit be ? 
   angela merkel , the german chancellor , acknowledged that a european union pact that sets limits on government deficits should be applied flexibly to promote economic growth . 
  hahahahaha . 
  it is exactly the same like 10 years ago . 
  hahaha . 
  [ one ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/2031381 ) . 
  [ two ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/nov/25/theeuro.politics ) . 
  [ three ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2870055/france-and-germany-smash-euro-pact.html ) and look at those stupid dutch people with their stupid budgetairy rules :  the 3 % rule and the subsequent penalties were formulated to prevent bad budgetary policies in one member state having an effect across the eurozone . 
  the pact has been controversial , with critics saying its focus on fighting inflation means it is ill-equipped to deal with slow growth . 
  but smaller countries , including the netherlands , have insisted that all 12 eurozone members should stay in line . 
  [ bbc , 2004 ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3888901.stm ) after 10 years and a huge crisis we finally manage to get them [ back in line ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/138c0570-f360-11e0-b98c-00144feab49a.html ) and enforce the 3 % rule , and now they 're going to fucking ignore it once again !, 
  i 'm seriously starting to shift towards the british opinion about this bloody euro . 
   practical fusion has been five years away for the last fifty years . 
  a lot of people think that it 's basically a myth well to be honest i 've been hearing this as well . 
  i do n't know much about it and the internet seems devided between `` it is the ultimate solution '' and `` it 's a myth '' . 
  does anyone here know how things are on the fusion front ? 
   this is why the southern countries are the worst in eu . 
  said bulgaria . 
  lmao . 
  i saw one in paris once , i think . 
  i already have vacation for 2 weeks . 
  would be shorter if i had resits though . 
  kampf = battle . 
  lager = camp . 
   how expensive is the insurance normally ?? 
  well you in nl you have basic insurance ( which covers the same regardless of which company you get your insurance from ) and extra insurance . 
  basic insurance is mandatory . 
  you can also go for an extra package ( this is optional ) . 
  these kind of package include ( each insurer offers different packages ) things like : * physiotherapy * dentist * vaccinations ( when traveling abroad , regulars are covered in basic ) , * glasses * alternative medicine * et cetera . 
  basic coverage pretty much includes everything you need . 
  these extra packages usually cost between $ 5 and $ 25 extra per month , depending on what you want . 
  i have basic insurance . 
  i pay about $ 80 bucks a month . 
  but because i 'm a student the tax authority lists me as `` no income '' so i also get health-insurance subsidy every month which is about $ 77 . 
   do you think it is cheaper than the taxes you would pay for nationalised healthcare or more expensive ?? 
  no idea . 
  we had a system like the british nhs until 2005 or so but i 'm too young to know that . 
  only option . 
  our system is what the us based obamacare on . 
  buying health insurance is mandatory and hospitals / clinics / doctors are private ( for - or non-profit ) . 
  we have * waaaaaaaay * more government regulation though . 
  prices are capped , coverage is fixed , deductables are fixed et cetera . 
  plus : care for the elderly and mental health and other `` special '' cases are payed for [ via taxes . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/awbz ), 
  apparently the eu recommends people not to drive faster than 130km/h on german autobahn , even if it is allowed . 
  or is it the german government that recommends this speed ? 
  manhattan belongs to the dutch !, 
  never forget !, 
  or welsh or nor ` n-ireland, 
   do n't even ask about forced sterilisation for trans people . 
  what do you mean by . . oh fuck it . 
  what about abortion ? 
  haha !, 
   where the dutch say they can because they can ask where the bathroom is , if you are a girl or a boy , and name the rooms in your house . 
  menage-a-troi , french kiss . 
  we also used to call syphilis the ` french deasease ' but that is out of use more or less . 
  finland does n't have gay marriage ? 
  o.o ??? 
  are we talking about the same finland ? 
   actually it 's exactly how a federal eu would not work . 
  provincial governments would not be able to ignore the rules because the federal government would just cut off funds . 
  federalism is the way to enforce the rules . 
  without federalism the rules are useless , as you have shown . 
  yes . 
  we had no way of enforcing the rules . 
  we honestly thought that countries with millions of citizens and a considarable gdp would not be this stupid . 
  we were wrong . 
  one of the countries even lied its way into the euro . 
  and now they are crying because they have to pay for they bought . 
  it is ridiculous . 
   you should get used to this . 
  federalism is an unstoppable political force . 
  you 're already in the union . 
  haha . 
  i love how people like you always talk about democracy but simply seem to ignore it when it suits you . 
   there are no brakes on the eutrain . 
  i sincerely hope you are wrong . 
   i do n't think there is a country in europe without nationalised healtcare , if there are some , please enligthen me . 
  the netherlands here . 
  we have private hospitals/health insurance et cetera . 
   my province can elect a shitty government , but it can not create a crisis because provinces do not have enough power to cause that much chaos . 
  independent states do .
