  federal oversight fixes this problem . 
  my province as well . 
  they ca n't do shit because we have a national government . 
  look at the us . 
  why do you believe that a federal authority wo n't fuck up ? 
  everyone knew this would happen . 
  that is why in the maastricht treaty we agreed to not have a deficit above 3 % . 
  and then france and germany decided [ in 2002 ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/2031381 ) that the rule did n't apply to them . 
  and of course . 
  then the greeks , italians and spanish said the same . 
  the italian eu commission president at the the time , romano prodi even called the pact [ stupid ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/2832505/germanys-deficit-to-smash-eu-limits.html ) . 
  i 'm sure the italians are laughing now . 
  we repeatedly [ tried to ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/28/news/28iht-franc_ed3__0.html ) convince especially france that this was a bad idea . 
  but they would n't listen . 
  do you get the point i 'm trying to make ? 
  you make all kinds of rules , just like we would for a federal eu . 
  and then france and germany agree that they will do something else and no one can stop them . 
  this is exactly how a federal eu is going to look . 
  so now , i 'd rather stay a country than become a small state in some people 's wet dream . 
   i would n't mind . 
  the economic advantages of joining the us outweigh any legal and cultural differences . 
  btw , that 's how representative democracies work . 
  by the way : we had a referendum in the netherlands in 2006 where 61 % ** voted against ** european integration . 
  and then it happened anyway . 
  it was n't . 
  the current crisis is the result of piigs lending far too much money . 
  greece even went so far as to lie about thier numbers . 
  this is exactly why i get pissed listening to tv debates . 
  stupid federalists continually repeating that we need a banking union , we need eurobonds , we need federal oversight , we need european taxes . 
  no we dont . 
  spain and greece fucked up their own country . 
  netherlands did n't , germany did n't , finland did n't austria , et cetera ... 5 countries out of the 18 in the eurozone and 28 in the eu fucked their own country up by electing bad officials . 
  why is this crisis the result of lack of federal oversight ? 
  it is not . 
  the whole `` debate '' we are having about the euro is about as misinformed as an american tv debate on weed or abortion . 
  and their using it to slowly take away authority from member states and giving it to the eu . 
  just like they did with the deficit control . 
  i dont care if we get a federal eu . 
  i just want to be able to cast me vote about it . 
  it is ridiculous how everyone in this subreddit is having a wet dream about a superstate federal eu without anyone asking if it is the people who want it . 
  how would you like it if your politicians made canada the 51st american state and you did n't have a say in it ? 
  i think you 'd start to get pretty pissed as well . 
  itt : people circlecirking over becoming a federal state . 
  am i seriously the only one not in favour ? 
   you ca n't have a monetary union without fiscal union . 
  why not ? 
  politicians who want a federal europe just keep repeating this until people start to believe it . 
  it is ridiculous . 
  the difference is that americans , in favour of a big federal government or not , all recognize that they are american . 
  in europe , the flag does n't represent the continent , or the people . 
  it represents the eu and a vision of a use . 
  most people ( probably 99,9 % ) do n't even know we have an official eu anthem . 
  the problem in europe is that the top wants a use and they are trying to ` force ' the people to feel european . 
  an anthem that no one knows , how much of an anthem is that ? 
  a flag that people see as symbol of a federal europe in stead of the continent , what kind of flag is that ? 
  the eu flag is the same as the one from the un . 
  it represents an institution , not a country or people . 
  most europeans are n't against cooperation or the euro . 
  they just do n't like that the top tries to shove it down their throat . 
   we already have a common judicial system no we do n't . 
  we have a european court but member states decide for themselves what is illegal and what not . 
  of course , in line with treaties and eurocourt decisions . 
   already have 1 flag which most people see as a symbol for a federal europe rather than a symbol for all european people . 
   already have an anthem yeah , i found that out a few months ago when someone mentioned it on reddit . 
  pretty sure 99 % of the european people do n't know there is one and that 99,99999 % do n't know what it sounds like . 
   athlete thing will never happen because we will crush in every sport . 
  there is also no point in doing this . 
  look at the uk !, 
   no need for a central bank , though we already have one . 
  its in frankfurt , germany yeah , i 'm kind of baffled how someone would not know we have a central bank ...  the capital is already there . 
  brussels well , to be honest . 
  how many people do you think see brussels as their capital ? 
  i see it only as the capital because the eu is there . 
  no offense , brussels is a lovely city , but amsterdam is my capital . 
  i think i can name some others who have tried to unite europe in one empire/kingdom/reich . 
   the uk believes that the dutch , the danes , the swedes and others are similarly opposed to the idea of a use : but somehow it seems to be the uk that gets to be the spokesperson . 
  it would be a major help if the dutch were a little louder at times !, 
  oh come on . 
  you know how it goes . 
  small countries ca n't afford to start making a public fuzz and going strongly against germany or france . 
  if we do that we fuck ourselves in other negotiations in the eu . 
  and what would happen if we publicly back you and you decide to leave anyway ? 
  then the netherlands will be in the same position the uk was when it decided to choose the us over france/germany regarding the iraq war . 
  it cost you the eu presidency ( blair was a widely support candidate , including by both france and germany ) . 
   also , why is this just the uk 's responsibility ? 
  because you are the only big country that supports this idea . 
  and just like in the un : big countries strong-arm smaller countries . 
  people in the netherlands always said ` the traingle ' when the big countries would discuss something : uk , france and germany . 
  now they started calling it ` merkozy ' or france-germany . 
  do you see the difference ? 
  because you publicly threaten to leave people stop taking you seriously . 
  germany and france are not a 100 % happy with how the eu is at the moment . 
  especially germany would like to implement some chances since they have to pay for it all . 
  but they always present themselves as committed to the eu . 
  at least publicly . 
  despite the fact that i am 100 % in favour of cooperation in europe . 
  i am 100 % ** against ** a united states of europe . 
  i know most people here are in favour ^ ^ ^ ( please_dont_downvote_because_you_disagree ) . 
  and i could present you with reasons why it wo n't work and all . 
  but the most important reason is : my gut .
