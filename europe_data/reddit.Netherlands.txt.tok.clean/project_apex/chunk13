  hehe . 
  am afraid it is not the euro that is costing us money . 
  it 's just some countries in the eurozone ... 
  pride was your demand ... 
   i am not sure if you meant it this way , but it sounds as if you are saying ireland and the netherlands are victims . 
  oh no absolutely not . 
  i know that we have these laws for these purposes . 
  the dutch tax authority skims off a few billion every year from the transactions . 
  a kind of middle-man fee as you will . 
  it seems ` the internet ' keeps repeating each other on the ` dutch are tall ' story . 
  according to our own bureau of statistics the average dutch man is about [ 1,81 cm ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/menu/themas/gezondheid-welzijn/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2012/2012-3746-wm.htm?languageswitch=on ) . 
  yet , everyone keeps claiming we average 1,85 or more ... 
  what about the people that do n't want to leave the eu but also do n't want to become a use ? 
   stick the queens mush every euro country mints their own coins . 
  dutch coins have our king , belgian coins theirs , german coins have an eagle . 
  we 'll need to talk about the renaming , though . 
  never heard of him . 
  so he will be ` our ' foreign policy chief ? 
  good luck . 
  even if the italians manage to come up with the most efficient and best system we could ever have for the eu , with a name like this it is doomed to fail . 
  and what happens when you run out of shale gas ? 
  right . 
  back to coal it is !, 
   it 's an acknowledgment of the driving force behind peace we 've had in europe for the last 60 years : european ~ ~ integration ~ ~ ** cooperation ** . 
  ftfy . 
  the reason we have a peaceful europe is because of a change in people 's ( and thus governments ' ) mindset . 
  the eu is a result of that mindset , not the driving force behind it . 
   it 's the replacement of nationalist myths , typically flag based , for a federalist myth based on a flag . 
  it 's supposedly a more agreeable myth , but not for me . 
  the point i was trying to make is that this flag should ** not ** represent a federal europe . 
  the flag is originally the flag of the [ council of europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ) . 
  the council of europe , founded by someone [ you might know ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winston_churchill ) it comprehended the basic idea that changed the course of european history : coorperation and debate in stead of war and fighting . 
  however , the flag was later incorporated by the european union as their own . 
  this is too bad because now the flag is used as a representative of the eu and its policies in stead of what it originally stood for : cooperation and debate . 
   the yugoslav wars did happen , however inconvenient , and ukraine is n't doing too grandly , and just about every eu member state was part of isaf . 
  of course it has n't been 100 % peaceful . 
  but if you ` zoom out ' and look at european history the last 500 years the wars and fighting we have seen in the past years are , however tragic for the people involved , minor events . 
   the reason why there 's little taste for fighting in the rest of europe is down just to the people , not governments . 
  i think that the eu has contributed to this though . 
  forcing politicians to debate over stuff in stead of threatening with economic sanctions and even war has changed the mindset people have about other countries . 
  in 3 generations we went from being a europe were we fought the most deadly and destructive wars among each other to a europe where economic sanctions and ` bigger gun diplomacy ' is ruled out as a way of changing things . 
  so , i agree with you that the eu is n't responsible for the peace in europe . 
  but the eu is the product of a new mindset in europe that started right after ww2 . 
  this kind of mindset was what the council of europe was founded to promote . 
  and it worked . 
  i just think that it is sad that the european union sort of ` hijacked ' the flag and changed it from a symbol for european cooperation to a symbol of a federal eu . 
  because the latter is a political choice while the former is something that all of us can agree on . 
  because the flag symbolises the end of a ~ 1500 year period that could be seen as a continuous european civil war that peaked twice in the 20th century . 
  this flag marks a new era in europe : one of cooperation and debate in stead of war and fighting . 
  and of course people are unhappy with the way things are now and lots has be changed in the eu and its institutions . 
  but this flag is more than brussels , the eu or the euro . 
  over the course of almost [ 60 years ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/ec-eu-enlargement_animation.gif ) this idea of cooperation and debate in stead of war and fighting has expanded to nearly all european nations . 
  including those who do n't want to join but do feel the same way ( norway , iceland and switzerland ) . 
  and it did so without firing a single shot !, 
  ( at least , not by the eu ) . 
  so whether you are a european federalist or a strong supporter of subsidiarity you can not deny that cooperation and debate is to be favoured over war and fighting . 
  and this flag symbolises that change in the way europeans treat each other . 
  you should watch the [ tax free tour ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4o13isddfy ) . 
  aired on dutch tv some time ago , very interesting to see my own country and ireland being used by international companies for tax avoidance ... 
  it is in english !, 
  this article does n't mention the fact that shale gas and oil is hyped and does n't deliver on promises by the industry regarding jobs and long term prospects on energy independence . 
  companies like shell are [ writing off ] ( http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/the-take/trouble-in-fracking-paradise/ ) on huge investments made in the u.s. plus , fracking companies are 100 % [ exempt from environmental ] ( http://www.edcnet.org/learn/current_cases/fracking/federal_law_loopholes.html ) regulation in the u.s. 
  in europe , costs for environmental protection would make investments even less viable . 
  fracking investments in poland , until recently dubbed ` europe 's posterboy ' for fracking , are [ failing as well ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26735000 ) . 
  shale gas & oil is a short term solution with a very high environmental cost . 
  if russia truly is influencing environmental policies for their own good then that is a process that should be countered as much as possible . 
  but lets not pretend that u.s. media like fp , nytimes and wsj have been unbiased regarding this subject . 
  the us media is being used by the fracking industry to show a positive image just like these environmental institutions are being used by russia / gazprom . 
  every european country has a populist party . 
  yours run against the eu , our against muslims , east europeans or the eu ( whichever way the wind blows ) , austria has the fpo , france the front national , greece has golden dawn , italy lega nord , et cetara . . 
  it 's just a way for people to express their discontempt with politics and the way the country is at the moment . 
  did you just see iran vs nigeria . 
  what would a world cup be without europe ... 
  source : united nations ** ( 2011 ) ** . 
  right ... 
   and for most my natural life my countries been at war . 
  im guessing most europeans feel this sentiment also . 
  not really . 
  i mean we sent some troops with you guys so we can call ourselves your friends . . 
  but . . not really , no . 
   the west needs to stop supporting middle east countries like saudi arabia who is most likely giving aid and weapons to sunni extremist groups like isis . 
  both the us and the uk have publically said that they would start sending weapons and training to the groups fighting assad . 
  de ja vu , anyone ? 
  you know , in stead of war , why do n't we just send weapons to those poor , moderate muslim farmers who are fighting for their freedom against the evil dictator and mother of all evil called assad . 
  and then afterwards we ask for our weapons back . 
  what could go wrong ? 
  i \u00b4 m sure they write good articles . 
  it is just that they have a huge bias towards what the u.s. government says or thinks . 
  to the point of self-censorship . 
  i 'm sure this matters less when it comes to domestic reporting , but internationally they are more or less a government news agency . 
  cool , i read the faz to try and improve * mein deutsch * . 
  the international version of the spiegel is also pretty good . 
  nyt ... objective . . not sure if sarcasm ... 
  are there any documentaries on drug use in ww2 ? 
  i always hear the stories lingering around threads like this ... 
  we get to sacrifice a country ?
