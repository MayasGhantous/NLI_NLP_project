  i thought the japanese did that ? 
  odd how no documentaries or.movies say anything about drug use by soldiers during the war, 
  yeap netherlands to . 
  westerbork is called a concentrationkamp while auschwitz is usually called an destruction camp . 
  al though in ww2 the first was usually a stop on the way to the latter . 
  is this the time for our `` slavetrading was done by publically traded enterprises and not by the government/country '' argument ? 
  [ best hope you 're kidding :( ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/low_countries ), 
  why do people always see not letting foreigners in as being racist ? 
  an american could n't take a dutch citizenship without renouncing their american one ... 
  errrr ma gud ... we are the only non-xenophobic nation in the world ... errr ma gud we so exceptionall ... err ma gud we work hard , rest of world does n't .

  english, 
  do you have a source for this ? 
  sounds interesting . 
  i am exactly 1,85 !, 
  but with shoes and about 3cm of hair i am easily a 1,90 . 
  1 liter cola per dag ? 
   i eat no breakfast , i would be down on the ground 5 minutes after i walk out the door . 
  i usually eat two tosti 's for breakfast . 
  4 slices with cheese or some meat for lunch and dinner . 
  most of the time i 'll eat a tosti or 2 around 22:00 or so before going to bed . 
  i have to say that my roommates eat about half of what i eat in a day . 
  i almost never drink anything else than water , coffee , beer and wine though . 
  that , i think , is 50 % of staying healthy . 
  fu . . oh he said overeating . 
  labeling them as having a disability would also suggest that obesity ca n't be overcome with willpower . 
  i 'm sorry but being obese is not the same as being paralyzed . 
  a paralyzed person ca n't train himself to walk again . 
  plus , in the netherlands they pay money for : - state pension - private pension - health care money ( for elderly care ) all this money will then go to healthy people who actually live long enough to claim their pension . 
  which is 67 in nl at the moment . 
  ^ ^ ^ ( yes , ^ ^ france , ^ ^ 67 ! ), 
  and , on the other side of the side effects of being fat ( less productive , sick more often ) are for the private sector . 
  and the medical help they need while being fat is payed for by themselves via insurance . 
  til : fat people are good for the dutch treasury . 
  why is everyone here focussing on eating bad / too much ? 
  is n't drinking unhealthy and too much about 50 % of the problem for most people ? 
  this is just pr talk for `` we fired the guy who typed this and we are sorry '' . 
  that 's not what you said when your northern part seceded .

  the conversation was held in english and there were no translaters on the lake .

  you are forgetting the aussies fighting rommel in africa . 
  where do you think the americans got all their iron for those war ships and tanks from ? 
   had canada ( or the free french , or australia , etc. ), 
  not been on the allied side , i doubt it would have made a critical difference in the eventual outcome . 
  the amount of ore , oil and other stuff that was mined out of canada 's ground and was being made into war material for the us , uk and soviet ( land-lease act ) is enormous . 
  soviet union * was * not a nation . 
  am i right , ukraine ? 
  ukraine ... ? 
   intelligent educated people like us know it was the soviets . 
  intelligent people know that ww2 in europe was fought in the east .

   really ? 
  no , but a lot is . 
   do parents speak english to their children at home sometimes , not as lingua franca of course . 
   or is it just something that comes up in culture ? 
   that 's pretty obvious . 
   where the hell do you get this from ? 
  none of my grandparents knew or know english . 
  a bunch of them knew german , sure , but never english . 
  well , my grandparents and the bejaardentehuis where i worked briefly . 
  they all knew english , i always thought this applied to all of the nl . 
  but it seems not . 
  those parts are subtitled ? 
  there is a small part of the population who fears this . 
  here is a website ( no english version , of coure ) : [ click ] ( https://onzetaal.nl/dossiers/dossiers/verengelsing/ ) . 
  but the vast majority does n't really care . 
  just like most of the dutch our government sees multi - lingual education as something good . 
  they are even expanding it to [ primary schools .

  i once went to a movie theater in germany thinking i would just listen to the english audio and ignore the german subtitles . 
  right ... at least it was an * aktion * movie so it did n't matter much . 
  i 've heard this over a 100 times probably but do n't quote me as a source since it has been a while . 
  it was 1944 and the city of maastricht had been liberated from the german occupants . 
  after a meeting they had in my grandparents ' school ( the same building my grandparents now live in : [ click ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@50.840875,5.691209,3a,75y,233.33h,86.53t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s09irzooefoqpwmphllozow!2e0 ) . ), 
  the [ allied leaders ] ( http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/7-8/notes/54.jpg ) decided to start up the [ local cement factory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enci ) because they needed cement for construction , rebuilding and other stuff . 
  anyway , some british lad took over the factory and all men were asked to come to the factory if they could . 
  no one was forced to work there but since the brits had just liberated us it was pretty much implied that you went if you could . 
  at least that is how my grandfather puts it . 
  my grandfather said that ` within days ' the british had hundreds of trucks going to and coming from the factory almost 24/7 . 
  he met a lot of british and american soldiers at the time who would distribute the cement from maastricht to all over the allied zone . 
  they would always trade chocolate for beers my grandfather found somewhere . 
  ( dutch euphemism for : stole the beers ) .
