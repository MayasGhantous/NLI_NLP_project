  i 'm fine with it as long as you pay for our defense . 
  the eu has an anthem ? 
  yes . 
  we are so terrible that we have to drive automatics, 
  you get my point , right ? 
  let me drive from southern norway to the north with 100km/h . 
  if you do n't drive during rush hour it is insane to force people to drive 100km/h on a 8 lane highway . 
  i heard a story about a fat man in the us once . 
  is everyone there fat now ? 
  ehm , i do n't think so . 
  turkey is a member of the council of europe and a proposal to create a flag that had a cross on it was rejected by them because it would be a symbol of christianity . 
   count richard nikolaus von coudenhove-kalergi proposed that they adopt the flag of his international paneuropean union , which was a blue field , with a red cross inside an orange circle at the centre , which he had himself recently adopted for the european parliamentary union . 
  [ 8 ] due to the cross symbolism , this was rejected by turkey ( a member of the council of europe since 1949 ) . 
  so the jesus thing is more than likely a myth ( or wish thinking ) . 
  the flag is originally the flag of the council of europe . 
  tough the eu accepted it as its flag in 1985 as well , the stars do not in any way represent eu members . 
  they , at the most , represent the members of the council of europe in 1955 . 
  the coe had 15 members at the time but because this is europe some countries did n't agree . 
  eventually they agreed upon using 12 stars . 
  no it did n't . 
  he has said that that particular start represents the netherlands and thats why he cut it out . 
  i 'm positive that 99 % of his voters could n't point to romania on a map . 
  let alone know about the 1956 revolution . 
  i do n't mind it . 
  the fact that only ~ 35 % of the votes in netherlands will actually vote means my vote is worth 3 times more . 
  say what you want , but the guy is a genious . 
  did you see how he went to brussels and cut a star out of a flag ? 
  it was filmed by the bbc , ard , monde , rai uno , nos and many more ... 
  seriously , how he manages to get more media attention than the an ecb meeting by cutting out a star is beyond me ... 
  i 'm truly amazed . 
   after they spit on our soccer players in 1990 . 
  he had it coming !, 
  you 'd be surprised of how much information you think you forgot will come back when you go to france and hear it around you all the time . 
  english -  german -  french . 
  no real confusion , it seems ? 
  not allowed to mention the differences between southern and northen europe i guess . 
  i also think that the fact that the uk pays more than 4 billion euros anually to the eu is noteworthy . 
  ~ ~ the uk 's ~ ~ englands government derives it power from the crown who derives its power from god ... 
  so technically ... 
  lol i had it wrong . 
  but , yes . 
  they broadcast reizen waes on dutch tv now . 
  and in talkshows they mention foute vrienden , zonde van de zendtijd . 
  that kind of shows . 
  someone has been watching reizen met waes !, 
  is this in - or excluding financial aid to piigs ? 
  edit : seeing that there are only 9 countries counted as net-contributor ... 
  it would not be convenient if the uk left . 
  did n't know that they contributed this much !, 
  how the hell does the country with the most gdp/capita rank below belarus ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ( no ^ ^ ^ offense ), 
  damn . 
  oooooh my ~ ~ gooooood ~ ~ allaaaah . 
  that snow suit !, 
  i want one !, 
  i think you should also take into account the possibility for women ( and men ) to work less than full-time when being a parent . 
  [ click ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/files/2013/12/alexandre-afonso-employment-and-equality-figure-2.jpg ), 
  i had to look 3 times ... is this a thing ? 
  what does the avarage russian dmitri think is the west ? 
  anything in europe except belarus and russia itself ? 
  are n't newspapers / written media free ? 
  i always thaught russian tv was heavily interfered with by the state but that written media is more or less free . 
  a dutch guy living in russia said this on tv some time ago . 
   edit : yeah , i get that france did n't do too well but on the bright side they 've given us a song to play during movember . 
  songs about moustaches are a rare breed . 
  `` did n't do well ? '', 
  dude , they had like 4 points ... 
  the 98 % is being quoted in dutch media . 
  looking forward to your source that it is 63.000 -  12.800 words . 
  never heard that before . 
  this is exactly what i mean . 
  i state that i am not in favor of a federal eu with a lot of centralised power . 
  within a day i get comments on how i `` blame the eu for everything '' , and i apperantly blame the eu for rainy days and car accidents ... you should look it from our side ... 
  in 1951 our country was a founding member of the [ ecsc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_coal_and_steel_community ) . 
  from that moment on we gradually gave the eu more and more power . 
  first a customs union , then a common market , now one currency . 
  and at the same time the eu gradually expanded its membership to 22 new countries . 
  we went from a position of being 1/6 of the total membership to 1/28 . 
  this , as you can see , is quite the difference . 
  do n't you say ? 
  and all of this , even the euro , happened ** without ** a referendum . 
  no one in nl gave its consent to a common currency , one market etc. . 
  but then it was 2006 !, 
  and the european leader were discussing a european constitution . 
  and this time we had a politician who thaught he should ask the people what they want before turning us into a province of europe . 
  the referendum was held . 
  ** [ 61,5 % of the dutch voted against the constitution . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_european_constitution_referendum,_2005 ) ** . 
  then they took 98 % of the constitutions ' text , called it the lisbon treaty , and passed it without a referendum . 
  and now we are part of a transfer-union , most of or laws get made at eu level , we ca n't change immigration or financial policy on our own , the ecb has to print money to keep southern europe alive ... not really the image that was promised to us, 
  think you are getting the wrong idea . 
  i am not saying that we ca n't work together . . of course we can . 
  i 'm just saying that the idea of a united states of europe is something that i would want to avoid at any cost . 
  look at the eu now . 
  there is more than 30.000 lobbyists . 
  when you put the government that far from the people and make a small number of people ( 750 in ep ) responsible for 500 + million people the risk of ` lobbying ' like it happens in the us is too big for me . 
  to be honest , the way lobbyists have influence now in d.c. or in brussels ... that does n't seem very democratic to me . 
  i think that we should work together like we do in the common market and with the euro : a collaboration between equals . 
  i do not see what advantage it would have to letting the eu decide everything for all of us even though we are very different . 
   those parties actively opposed to closer integration have decided not to take part in electing democratic candidates for commission president . 
  indeed .
