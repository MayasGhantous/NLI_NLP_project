  this whole ep2014 is a joke in my country . 
  the only parties that are agianst more eu are a right-wing anti-muslim party and the socialist party which has economic policies that would make a 9 year old cry . 
  all the others are talking about how badly we need the eu and how we would all be dead if we did n't have the holy european union . 
  the ` democratic ' process involving ep2014 is a joke . 
  it 's like watching a republican primary debate in the us . 
  they all agree ... 
  which one of them is not in favour of a federal europe ? 
  oh god ... the horror . 
  working together ; great . 
  united states of europe ? 
  nope . 
  happy in my own country . 
  no need for a federal eu , imho, 
  you either die a hero ... 
  if crimea was an invasion what was the iraq war ? 
  getting the pigs back in line with the rest of eu and making sure france stays in line as well . 
  anything else seems a lower priority to me , the worst part of the crises might be over but we are n't in safe water yet . 
  lots to be done . 
  paper . 
  you use credit cards in denmark ? 
  we have cash-less shops in the netherlands . 
  quiet a lot actually . 
  i know several no-cash supermarkets . 
  my school does n't accept cash anymore . 
  there is even a kebab place that does delivery and only accepts pin payments . 
  anyway , i almost never use cash anymore , unless when i 'm in a bar , these are the last venue 's in nl to not accept pin yet . 
  you should check your sources when it comes to finland being steamrolled by russia . 
  i 'm sorry to shatter your ` france is still relevant ' bubble . 
  but france and the uk could n't even bring libya on its knees without help from the us . 
  well to answer your question : i 'd rather leave . 
  i think nato is a good thing , but for us spend even more on defense just seems pointless . 
  take a look at this graph : [ click ] ( http://harlotofthearts.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/defense_spending1.jpg ) . 
  it is not europe that spends too little , it is the us that is out of line with the rest of the world . 
  before 9/11 happened the u.s. spend 50 % of nato 's total budget . 
  take a look at [ this graph ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/images/nato-budget-trend.gif ) too . 
  it is not europe that is spending less , it is post-9 / 11 united states that is spending way more than they used to . 
  the fact that the us now pays 75 % of nato 's budget is because they increased their spending by almost 50 % , not because europe is dropping the ball . 
  and , the whole defense spending is a useless debate : the eu spends more on defense than russia . 
  the problem is that it is scattered in 28 armies . 
  if the eu would double its defense spending then we would simply have 28 better funded , yet too small , armies . 
  relying on france ? 
  you go ` all out ' on some stone-throwing muslims in mali and car and suddenly everyone is ` relying ' on france and the uk . 
  lol . 
  the only one that all of europe is relying on is the us . 
  the uk and france combined spend about 1/7 of what the us spends ... 
  the derivatives are the result of less and less regulation for the financial sector . 
  not the result of easy money . 
  and not all derivatives are bad , just the ones with the high risk . 
  stop thinking the world will end , lol . 
  the pigs are in a crises but the north is allready recovering and the east is growing fast . 
   the price of money is set by the ecb and that control the credit simply the money got focus on housing in spain the money expansion is still going and there are another bubbles that need to pop , the reply u give me show you have no fucking idea how the banking and credit expansion works there is more to creating a housing bubble than cheap credit . 
  every country in the eurozone had access to this ` money printing ' you talk about . 
  then why has n't every euro-area country failed like spain ? 
  we do have our own [ gas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groningen_gas_field ) . 
  besides , spain imports gas from qatar , nigeria and algeria . 
  not like spain is ` energy-independant ' . 
   yes because you can grow tomatoes in november/december/january / february with 50 cm of snow [ yes , actually . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netherlands#agriculture ) do n't feel bad , mhhkay ? 
  you do n't have to feel offended . 
  it is not your fault ( personally ) that your country 's economic policy failed . 
  and we do n't need russian gas or food imports either , thank you very much . 
  took in a massive amount of russian money . 
  bet it on the financial markets . 
  problem when banks failed . 
  lol . 
  like spains banking problem , housing bubble and more are the eu 's fault , lol . 
  it 's not the eu 's or the euro 's fault that you elected poor leaders . 
  take a look at [ this graph ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2014/05/blogs/graphic-detail/20140503_gdc831.png ) . 
  this is why we have the eu . 
  `` 40 years of communism not fixed by 10 years in eu '' - euronews . 
  agree . 
  had to read this in hs and it was the only book i did n't mind reading . 
  i do n't read as much but both my parents said : ** netherlands ** [ the discovery of heaven ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_discovery_of_heaven ) by harry mulisch . 
  why ? 
  we spent as much as russia , china and india combined . 
  our lack of action involving crimea is the result of politics . 
  we simply do n't feel that crimea is important enough to escalate this situation with russia . 
  it is not like we would suddenly all see eye to eye on foreign and military policy if we doubled our budget tomorrow . 
  actually my country helped with both . 
  just not with so many men that our defense spending doubled . 
  who says it need to be 50/50 ? 
  you guys want to have military bases everywhere , fly drones daily in 5 countries etc. . . 
   the united states finances nearly three-quarters of nato 's military spending , up from 63 percent in 2001 ... 
  it is not europe 's fault that we did n't go along with your huge post 9/11 defense spending increase . 
  we did n't occupy 2 countries for a decade ... 
   significant numbers of troops in europe are n't to our advantage . 
  yes they are . 
  they fight for your freedom , show some respect !, 
  vote republican !!,

  til the estonian government has better digital services than my own . 
  i 'm just kidding dude . 
  that [ missile shield ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/us_missile_defense_complex_in_poland ) is definitely in your own interest . 
  as are the [ troops ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_military_deployments#europe ) in europe . 
  hehe .
