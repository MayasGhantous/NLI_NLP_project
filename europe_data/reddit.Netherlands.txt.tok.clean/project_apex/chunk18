  have the item send to you and hope customs does n't charge you . 
  i do it all the time with electronic products from china . 
  have the sender put a note on it that says . 
  ` old family photos ' . 
  customs wont care . 
  it is the idea that you should not handle things if a body below you can handle it . 
  basically : if a national parliament is fitted to deal with something then there is no need to the eu parliament to do it . 
  if a local municipality can handle something there is no need to the national parliament to handle it . 
  the idea behind this is that you need to put deciscion making at the lowest possible level . 
   now do we post propaganda at / r/europe ? 
  psst . 
  this is n't what putin actually thinks , ^ it ^ ^ is ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ joke, 
  it is where all of europe goes on holiday ... 
   `` in de kelder ?!??!, 
  `` merely an exercise '' . 
  hehe, 
  you got to vote on it ? 
   of course one can not forget to mention your country holland , aka germany 's little bitch . 
  [ only poor countries are germany 's bitch . 
   irrelevant in fact : yes ! . 
  i would like nothing more than my country to be irrelevant on the global geopolitcal theatre . 
  in the netherlands we have been on too many ` peace keeping ' missions and spent way too much cash trying to fit in with the big boys . 
  it is ridiculous . 
   it would pay for its own defense . 
  hehe . 
  i think that letting the us pay for most of our defense spending is probably the only thing that all european nations agree on . 
  russia : russian aircraft flies over russia . 
  i once asked a friend why he preferred vlc media player . 
  i got this back in the mail :  vlc is the ak-47 of media players . 
  it does not break , crash , or freeze . 
  it plays every container and codec you throw at it . 
  it 'll play files that are broken and built it 's own media index if it has to . 
  but it will play . 
  been using vlc ever since . 
  seems he was right . 
  i can not stress this enough . 
  every member of the eu parliament seems convinced everything should be decided at their level . 
  it 's absurd . 
  except for israel ( and perhaps west turkey ) there does n't seem to be anything you 'd want thats not underground . 
  the uk has n't left yet ? 
  haha , that map shows your 'em pire ' without holland , germany , denmark , poland , finland and the baltic states . 
  you 'd be bankrupt before you 'd start . 
   social security nope . 
  nope . 
  nope . 
  social security at a federal level will be a field day for fraudsters . 
   what can be done best at the state level be done there . 
  [ subsidiarity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subsidiarity ) agreed !, 
   but let 's first solve the problems we have with it while i * do understand * what you mean i think you are saying it wrong . 
  there is absolutely no problem with the euro as a currency or the financial architecture behind it . 
  the problems we have are a result of massive government and public debts in the southern countries . 
  which the maastricht treaty prohibits , but those countries chose to ignore that . 
  now we have to enforce those rules ( like the 3 % deficit ) like some parent grounding a kid to prevent it from happening again .

  no city that ever was capital of europe can be the capital of the eu . 
  ^ ^ imho, 
   it 's a bit much to ask all soldiers to be multilingual i do n't really know how this is in the rest of the eu but here i only know 2 persons from my generation that ca n't make themselves understandable in english . 
  besides that , france and the uk have ~ ~ colonies ~ ~ crown dependancies to defend . 
  but without france and the uk there is pretty much no point since those are the two biggest armies and the only other country that whoms army could form a base for a european army is germany . 
  but , you know , history . 
  well , first of all , i did n't even picture the uk in an european army . 
  if there will ever be one . 
  the language problem can be overcome . 
  all nato armies allready work together in afghanistan . 
  english is the lingua franca i think . 
  in any case something has to change , having 28 armies ranging in size from very small to pretty big is n't efficient . 
   does n't consolidation of forces bring up the problem of countries wanting access to the capabilities of the more militarised eu states ( britain and france spring to mind ) without paying for it ? 
  consolidating our armies into one also brings forth another problem : every nation throughout history that had military capability like europe would have with one army , used it as an agressive force . 
  this is something we should n't want . 
  just look at the us and how much wars they have fought in the past 70 years since they are the global superpower . 
  or germany before that . 
  or england before that . 
  if europe ever gets one military then i think any use of that military outside the eu 's own territory should be unanimousley agreed upon by all 28 ( or more ) members . 
  it would make sure no one would dare to invade any eu territory while also protecting us from the hegemenous power syndrome . 
   there is a crisis in the eu ? 
  the dog fighting with the turkish neighbours ' f16 is worth it too . 
  welfare gets translated to dutch as a general term for when the government hands out money : ` uitkering ' . 
  this can be for different reasons . 
  the bijstand is a form of ` uitkering ' . 
  it is money you get when you have nothing else ( no savings , no job or other income or other form of ` uitkering ' ) . 
  ~ ~ what did you do to het netherlands ? 
  i wonder how that finnish tv station rated us :d ~ ~ apparently we exercise much . . who knew . 
   the dutch are big into physical exercise and have a comparatively positive attitude to life . 
  they are optimistic about the future . 
  but they 're no coffee addicts , ** drinking less coffee than the eu average ** . 
  either the finnish tv station or [ this wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_coffee_consumption_per_capita ) entry have it wrong . 
  i think i 'm going to need a video like this for all the eu countries . 
  would definitely help in commenting on reddit ... 
   i really belong in  finland  my closest soulmates are in  denmark , germany  i 'm farthest from  greece , cyprus sounds legit . 
  edit : it seems belgium is the most avarage of all nations !, 
  we have something called ` bijstand ' . 
  it is money you get when you ran out of unemployment , no pension et cetera . 
  i did n't know how to translate it . . 
  it is indeed not basic income because you lose it as soon as you can earn your own money . 
  thanks !, 
  edit : what does ` survivor ' mean ? 
  edit : [ apparently not ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yde57spf4hk ), 
  well you do n't have to watch ? 
  look at that defense spending in europe . 
  what is defined as social protection ?
