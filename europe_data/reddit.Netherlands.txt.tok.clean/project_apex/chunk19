  unemployment ? 
  basic income ? 
  etc. . 
  oh . . never knew !, 
  hang on ? 
  italy was ` liberated ' in stead of ' defeated ' ? 
  we 'll take the lakes . 
  holland can into poldering . 
  the esa is not part of the eu, 
  i wonder too what our stats would be . 
   gypsies unifying europe since ... whenever . 
  true . 
  i am from maastricht but the dialect here is different than the one 2 towns over . 
  the more distance the more difference in dialect . 
  usually when i talk to a limburger ( person from limburg ) i will speak my own dialect and he or she his . 
  even though they are different we can both understand each other . 
  i speak [ limburgish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limburgish_language ) a dialect spoken only in limburg ( nl/be ) and a part of germany . 
  i have a twin size bed , friends and relatives sleep there all the time when they stay over . 
  why sleep on the couch if you have a bed ... 
  i do not have a sister however , so would n't know about that . 
  easiest way to get the netherlands to # 1 on all eu lists ? 
  kick finland out . 
  both american sources saying the same . 
  not really relevant . 
  i assume you are american youself . 
  any of the claims you make about russia are just copy-pasted right out of the article who write it like truth without naming one source . 
   and half yugoslavian you do n't have any clue about yugoslavia , do you ? 
  i was born and raise in the netherlands by dutch parents . 
  one of them is british . 
  but even though we go there on holidays , i know the language , the history ( [ fuck yeah ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raid_on_the_medway ) ) , and watch the football ( the reds !!! ), 
  i do n't consider myself british . 
  i am not trying to say you are `` wrong '' or anything , just saying that when europeans say `` im polish '' that means you are from the country poland and grew up in polish culture/education/etc ... 
  but , imho , i think the whole `` what country are you from '' is pretty obsolete anyway now . 
  i watch british , german , spanish football , british and american tv shows , european movies ( intouchables < 33 ) and i regularely speak to and play games with complete strangers online who are all over the world . 
  americans should just know that no one in the world calls themselves `` from '' a country if their grandparents emigrated from it . 
  and the rest of the world should know that americans have a different concept of `` coming '' from somewhere . 
   that 's fairly obvious . 
  did n't they `` claim '' a bit land back in a decades long legal fight ? 
  and what did they do first when they had their land to celebrate their culture ? 
  they build a fucking 12 story casino to make money abusing the laws they can set in their `` own '' land . 
  look at that last sentence , native americans are as american as it gets . 
  imagine being that guy . 
  either being extradited to the u.s. or to russia . 
  guess the netherlands is looking pretty good right now . 
  hope for him he negotiates a come-back clause, 
   but you are much more nationalistic than any european country . 
  do n't you notice that ? 
  pledge of allegiance ? 
  you sing your national anthem before every freakin ' event ? 
  stuff like that does not happen here ** anymore ** . 
  ftfy . 
  click on `` view comments '' if you want to see what kind of facist , bureaucratic , anti-religious , corrupt , disturbing , racist country i apparently live . 
  the comments are ammusing to say the least . 
  my ` z ' key is half-broken so i have to jam it really hard for it to work . 
   and this is not propaganda , this publication is meant for an american academic / policy-making audience . 
  it is a publication by [ walter russel mead ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walter_russell_mead ) , an neo-conservative that is an editor at [ the american interest ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_american_interest ) , a conservative think-thank . 
  but , of course , this is a `` publication meant for an american academic / policy-making audience '' . 
  just like those we saw in the months before the iraq war . 
  this subreddit has been filled with propaganda from both sides of the crimea conflict for weeks . 
  can we quit it ? 
  there is absolutely no benefit to posting the same escalating , unconfirmed `` experts '' on russia that continuously call putin the new hitler and russia and imperialist war-mongerin nation . 
   everyone finds them irrelevant i guess . 
  it 's probably about lazyness . 
  if you want to create a map the eu lists the statistics for all its members . 
  you 'd have to manually look for suisse and norway and others . 
  too much work i guess . 
  it is not good , though . 
  suisse and norway are two of the most developed countries in the world . 
  would n't hurt to benchmark the netherlands agianst those in stead of agianst of spain or greece ... 
  russia buys it naval vessels from france ... not really big difference there . 
  european countries are n't allowed to sell millitary equipement to china though . 
   this sub is about europe , not the european union not what you 'd think if you look at all the maps and graphs in the sub . 
  almost allways suisse and norway are n't shown . 
  but 170 billion here buy way less than 170 billion there . 
  so i think you should compare defense spending as percentage of gdp . 
  and then onwards to ascension !, 
   because easter is a religious holiday and the majority of the population in czechia are atheists ? 
  same here in the netherlands . 
  my family still celebrates easter , christmas etc. . . who cares what its original purpose was . 
  gezelligheid is good . 
   tanzverbot but ... why ? 
  what does good friday have to do with dancing ? 
  in the netherlands we have an e-tax system . 
  you go to the tax office 's website and download a file . 
  you log on with your digital passport . 
  since i 'm a student my taxes are pretty simple . 
  everything ( income , health insurance , deductables etc. . ) are allready filled out by the tax office . 
  you only have to check them . 
  other than that it is as simple as installing software . 
  you click ` next ' , ' next ' , ` finish ' . 
  after that you wait for the tax office to return the money they owe you . 
  here is an example of a tax declaration : [ click ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qtmaqic.png ), 
  no tv / radio / means of communication . 
  you think they bring newspapers to the siberian woods ? 
  do you speak russian or do you have an alternative source ? 
  i 'd like to take a look at the questions and the answers . 
  this seems like an important detail ... 
   sounds familiar and seems like there 's a recurring theme here ... we actually have pretty good infrastructure in the netherlands . 
  thanks for picking up the defense tab . 
   does n't really mean a huge amount does it with all due respect ... israel is a western country that is close to iraq , saudi-arabia , yemen , egypt , syria .
