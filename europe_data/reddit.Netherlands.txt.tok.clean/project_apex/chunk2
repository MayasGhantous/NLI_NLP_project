  but they should stop handing over soevereignity without democratic consent or even debate . 
  indeed , the the president of saudi arabia oil policies and strategic expectations center has said that they will keep oil prices low to put pressure on other countries . 
  russia , for example , needs about $ 90 per barrel to finance its spending . 
  anything below that will result in a deficit for the federal government . 
  no , the saudi 's have a number of agenda items they can get to with this move . 
  1 ) it will force russia into a position where it has to reevaluate support for assad ( whom the saudi 's want gone ) . 
  2 ) iran will be in a worse position during the negotiations with the p5 + germany . 
  saudi arabia is very scared iran with get nukes and is vocally agianst iran . 
  3 ) shale oil in the us is only viable at about ~ $ 90 ( brent oil ) per barrel . 
  the saudi 's now have it at $ 85 which will make sure that a lot of ( financial ) problems will rise in the us shale industry . 
  for the white house the first two are golden while the third does n't matter * that * much since it 's private money that will be lost in the shale industry , not state money . 
  saudi-arabia is once agian proven to be a very strategic [ ally ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-10-10/why-oil-plunging-other-part-secret-deal-between-us-and-saudi-arabia ) for the us in the middle-east . 
  let 's see if this play can actually pressure russia . 
  looks more and more like the us congress . 
  only difference is that our parliament can not introduce laws by itself thankfully . 
  it 's none of the south :'), 
  [ d'artagnan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_de_batz-castelmore_d%27artagnan ) from the three musketeers [ is buried ] ( http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=3b5ab778-b816-40f3-82c0-04e7f1eeff9b ) in my [ hometown ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maastricht ) . 
  also : birthplace of the euro . 
  also : karl marx ' sister ( and him too , for a while ) lived in [ the same street ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/bouillonstraat,+6211+lh+maastricht,+nederland/@50.8468724,5.6880037,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c0e9b0a6863b1f:0x7824e0bf5b2ed41c ) as my family did . 
   `` oh , no gay marriage , no abortions ? '', 
  `` less benefits for you . . '' . 
  this would severely increase the eu 's interference with national laws . 
  plus , if you start with laws that punish members for not doing something even though it is their right to decide it the eu can extend its power virtually unlimitly . 
  one example of this is the us drinking age . 
  * technically * the states themselves decide on the drinking age but the federal congress simply gives [ less benefits ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_minimum_drinking_age_act ) to states who permit it . 
  they use highway funds ( unrelated to drinking age ) as a leverage . 
  even though i am in favour of gay-mariage i think forcing countries with financial instruments would be a very bad prescedent . 
  it was a joke ... 
  every time i see a arab talk about personal freedoms they have there , i laugh , being a current resident of the netherlands . 
  your countries are so cute . 
  just googled it . 
  seems the upper limit is 3k a month . 
  also , your benefit is 75 % of your last salary the first 2 months and drops to 70 % after that . 
  you get 70 % of your last salary for 2 years after being fired . 
  ( does n't count if you quit ) . 
  if that runs out you get ` bijstand ' . 
  which is about $ 1050 is you have kid ( s ) and $ 750 if you do n't . 
  if you live together then you recieve ~ $ 1500 together . 
  keep in mind though that ` poor ' people in the netherlands get a lot of other benefits , including but not limited to : child benefit ( between $ 200/q and $ 300/q , depends on kids age ) , health care benefits ( $ 80/m ) , long-term benefits , ` special ' - expenditures benefits . 
  and this is the national government . 
  local governments also give out other benefits . 
  edit : everyone gets child benefits btw , not just poor people . 
  edit2 : to answer your second question : yes you can live buy it . 
  it 's not as good as having a job of course but it 's not really hard either . 
  this sub is more pro-eu then anywhere i 've seen . 
  except the uk is n't in the euro and the uk is not a german bundesstaat in terms of economy . 
  we ca n't leave if germany does n't leave ... it would be suicide . 
   want to be completely sovereign ? 
  do n't join the eu !, 
   or , leave the eu ... the problem in the netherlands , france and most of the ` old ' eu nations is that we never did neither . 
  we never voted to join a eu where the eu gets to decide over us . 
  we , over the course of 70 years , gradually rolled into it step by step . 
  until there was no return ... 
  the us is just creating another stock bubble . 
  anyway . 
  everyone here seems to think that printing money can do anything else but postpone the enivitable . 
  ill be laughing when the dollar stops being used for oil . 
   you mean the part of europe that keeps making cuts to maintain 3 % and watches their countries shrink in a deflationary spiral ? 
  i mean the part that has to makes cuts so they can pay for the money they spent during 2002 ~ 2008 . 
  you 're american , you should know : if you max out your credit card then you lead a wonderfull life short time but a hard one long term . 
  what a bullshit . 
  if lending money and spening it produced economic growth then southen europe would be the most wealthiest part of the eu . 
   if we had a central government in the eu all those german solar panels would have been built in southern countries and they would be much more efficient . 
  we have a central government and we do shift billions to southern europe . 
  they just spend it on other things . 
  nl : 406.3 / km2 dk : 131/km2 population density ^ wind is not a viable renewable energy source . 
  too much fluctuation and it contains moving parts , which will break down . 
  pfff . . what a mistake ... 
  you have more land though ... 
  so people / area = a lot higher in austria . 
  you would have no power during the night . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  if love how in america this is completely normal and acceptable for all ages but a nipple , oh god , a nipple on tv is satan himself . 
  love how our european politicians have completely fucked up our global reputation in so many countries by always pointing the finger and imposing sanctions and stuff . 
  what has iran ever done to us to deserve these crippling sanctions from the eu ? 
  we just do wat the us tells us to ... its ridiculous . 
  for those interested : [ click ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_emission_trading_scheme ) . 
  my country is one of the countries that does this . 
  because we ` buy ' norways green power and ` sell ' it our dirty power we can say we are increasing our renewables while we actually do n't give two fucks . 
  the ` buy ' and ` sell ' are in quotes because none of the power is actually going to or coming from norway . 
  its just traded on paper . 
  its a complete farce . 
  in nl you can even sell your power as ` green ' if you throw in 20 % of wood when you burn coal . 
  how this is green is beyond me , but ok . 
  hey look , cameron is pretending that england is in the middle of the atlantic rather than off the coast of france agian . 
   why would the eu do this and not finland and estonia themselves ? 
  good lobbying on finnish and estonian side . 
  my city and province does the same . 
  we have some good lobbyists in brussels and got $ 15,000,000 for a tunnel in our city . 
  anyway , it is pretty random . 
  research in nl has shown that some city 's and provinces manage to get millions from the eu while others do n't . 
  if you know the right people then everything can be a `` direct benefit to the eu '' . 
  among other things the eu also payed 30 % of our new tram line , 100 % of new parking places for trucks and cost for maintanance of a ( historical ) bakery . 
  my city employs some decent lobbyists . 
  we once had te room pretty much cleared so we could all see it properly when we went there with school . 
  some 8 years ago i think . 
  also : if you plan a trip to disneyworld in paris you should go * right after * al-qaida makes a threat to blow it up . 
  we went there and there we * no lines at all ! * . 
  we went into space mountain thing about 10 times in a row . 
  i still ca n't figure out though if my parents are smart or just do n't give a shit if we get blown up .
