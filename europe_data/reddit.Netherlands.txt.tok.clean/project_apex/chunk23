  we have n't really been significant since the golden age . 
  but we still hold the record for most [ profitable company ] ( http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/photos/most-valuable-companies-ever-adjusted-for-inflation-1351801906-slideshow/#crsl=%252fphotos%252fmost-valuable-companies-ever-adjusted-for-inflation-1351801906-slideshow%252fmost-valuable-companies-in-history-adjusted-for-inflation-photo--1113431046.html ) !, 
  take that . 
  so that means i can get a subscription to a carrier in , lets say , latvia and i can use it in the netherlands ? 
   why would the us want a divided europe ? 
  because then the u.s. has one less actor to deal with in international relations . 
   also i 'm not sure if it was a mistake . 
  it would be better for internal eu balance structure if ~ ~ england ~ ~ the uk was in . 
  now its just france and germany . 
   yes , for instance london is far more euro friendly than scotland , wait , what ? 
  i thought the scots wanted to join the euro if by any chance they go through with their independance ? 
  i have one of [ these ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=fluitketel&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=0-dpuvstmqmn7abtzidgaw&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=806 ) . 
  what is your judgement ? 
   britain and france have always competed for the position as europe 's great power ( with russia and germany overtaking both of you in the last century ) . 
  damnit why does everyone forget the [ dutch ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_golden_age ) . 
  i did n't mean to offend you , just thought that `` not being able to find anything different '' is a bit weird to say . 
  of course they are european but there are some differences between them and the continental part of europe . 
   yeah , the worldwide conspiracy to raise global temperature by 4c , i tell you man . 
  yes and this will cause the sea level to rise to we can sell more dikes !, 
  $ 118.956,14 ftfy, 
  the eu should bee them out . 
  ^ ^ ill ^ ^ let ^ ^ myself ^ ^ out ... 
  that 's because your country is a bit more individual than others . 
  you speak english as first language and thus you have closer ( cultural ) relations to canda , us , aus and n-z for example . 
  france pretty much sees europe and the eu as their project , with france in the centre . 
  germany pretty much lets the french think they are the centre because they cba to be it themselves but brittian wo n't accept that . 
  also british participation in the iraq war has n't done the relations any good . 
  blair would 've probably become the eu president if it was n't for that war . 
  and , lets be honoust , you 're an island . 
  even with the tunnle and planes its still hard to get there . 
  i live in the netherlands and the german border is as far from me as the british border but i go to germany more often simply because its easier . 
   i have never been able to find anything in the uk that was `` very different '' . 
  i hope you do n't have a drivers licence . 
  well england usually pretends to be in the middle of the atlantic rather than off the coast of france when it comes to politics . 
  but brits in amsterdam have never failed to make me laugh , great people to have a beer with . 
  and , lets be honoust , we are all a little jealous of you not adopting the euro now . 
  is n't this because all farmers now grow biofuels in stead of food ? 
  i heard that these crops only flower in march or so and that it is bad for bees since they need flowers all summer through ... gon na check if i can find that source agian . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://nos.nl/audio/595221-zon-7-miljard-bijen-tekort.html ) it is . 
  only for cool people though . 
   the life of the others i ca n't help but feel like it is a totally different movie when you translate german movie titles like der untergang and das leben der anderen to english . 
  [ intouchables ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) has a 8.6 on imdb . 
  beating am\u00e9lie . 
  haha , what a joke . 
  i remember getting seeing enourmess amounts of money when we went to italy for vacation . 
  i once got 10.000 lira as pocket money . 
  i assumed that my parents were rich but fact is that the lira was just worthless ... 
   right-wing politicians should come with a black-and-white sticker on them : `` warning : austerity is harmful to your health '' . 
  southern europeans should get stickers that say : '' [ warning ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4058327.stm ) : [ free money ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4053809.stm ) [ does n't exist ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3376993.stm ) . 
  welcome to the eu where every fucking country can veto every change . 
  @below : every change to the eu can be veto 'd by any country . 
  the fact that some policies that are made within the eu use qmv does n't change that . 
   humans are exceptional because we can handle beyond our incentives in my opinion . 
  you think you can . 
  take for example sugar . 
  in early days of humanity sugar was rare and only found in fruits and stuff . 
  so sugar equalled energy & vitamines . 
  now sugar is everywhere and even though we al * know * that we do n't need more sugar our brain is still hardwired to give a reward ( sweet taste ) when we eat it . 
   everyone has had trouble with people saying what they want . 
  i 'm really tired but i 'll post my awesome analogy tomorrow . 
  terribly sorry here but i do n't recal an american using his freedom of speech to rally millions of people behind him for the sake of murdering an entire race . 
  thats not how it works here . 
  if you want to be a judge you simply need to follow the right education . 
  plus if you dissagree with a judge you can go to a higher court for a second opinion . 
   i just do n't feel comfortable with any restrictions on free speech . 
  well you can understand that europe has had issues with letting people say what they want . 
  a judge . 
  hello there mr. american , freedom of speech = / = freedom of hate speech . 
  sincerely , europe, 
   nationalism is by far the most stupid human behaviour in my opinion . 
  no its not . 
  humans are evolutionairy hardwired to form groups and draw lines . 
  just likes wolves mark their territory humans draw borders . 
  every human being has an evolutionairy incentive to join or create groups . 
  on any level . 
  from countries to religious groups to social groups in school . 
   and really has no negative or positive affect on anything . 
  oh come on ... 
  either the european media is lying to us or you live in a different u.s. when it comes to your flag . 
  they should see some dutch comedians ... 
  they 'd have the this is racism flag up before the show was past the first 10 minutes . 
   but i ca n't see why uk people do n't like us ? 
  because politicians need votes . 
  it 's the same here in holland . 
  everyone is very proud of our flower industry but at the same time they critisize the immigration from countries like poland . 
  no politician ever mentions that 90 % of the employees in the flower business are immigrants . 
  yes . 
  but my point was that you can have free movement and open borders without the eu and that some non-eu countries also participate . 
  every time someone argues agianst the eu someone slaps him with ' i dont want border checkpoints no more ' argument . 
  the eu was founded by benelux , france , w-germany and italy . 
  then it made sense to cooperate . 
  the entire structure of the eu ( rotating chairmanship , all members having veto on a lot of issues , every fucking country having a say in things etc. . ) is build for serving a small number of members . 
  this does simply not work with 28 members . 
  also , the eu has been transformed from a co\u00f6peration between equals to a charity organisation . 
  i completely agree with the subsidies that other eu countries give to former east-block countries , the succes of poland and slovenia will surely repay . 
  but this is not what the eu was for . 
  and no one ever voted for it to be this . 
  however , the eu is in way over its head with 13 new countries since 2004 . 
  the model for the eu should be nato . 
  you work together , but every country keeps control of its own army .
