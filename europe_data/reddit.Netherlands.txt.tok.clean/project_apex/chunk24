  and , as if the difference between western and eastern european countries was n't enough it now also shows that most of the wealth growth in the southern eu was coming from borrowed money . 
  even though northern countries specifically warned other eu countries about this they are still picking up the tab for their mess . 
  all with all : it was good when it was a union of equals with only 6 members . 
  now , with 28 members devided in 3 groups ( north , south , east ) it becomes clear who can pay for the party . 
  just because the eu incorporated the treaty in its own treaty doens ' t mean that it is part of the eu . 
  it simply means that by signing the eu treaty you automatically sign the schengen treaty . 
  but . 
  you do n't have to be a eu member to join it . 
  nor do you have to sign it if you are a eu member ( uk , ireland ) . 
   the schengen agreement led to the creation of europe 's borderless schengen area in 1995 . 
  the treaty was signed on 14 june 1985 between five of the then ten member states of the european economic community near the town of schengen in luxembourg . 
  it proposed the gradual abolition of border checks at the signatories ' common borders . 
  measures proposed included reduced speed vehicle checks which allowed vehicles to cross borders without stopping , allowing of residents in border areas freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints and the harmonisation of visa policies . 
   i am in toulouse and i want to buy some stuff in spain ? 
  just take the car . 
  i am in paris and i want to go to amsterdam or liege ? 
  just take a ticket . 
  i am skeeing and i go to italy . 
  nobody give a fuck . 
  many people make this mistake . 
  the eu = / = no borders . 
  the fact that you can travel from spain to netherlands without crossing any border checkpoints is because those countries are a member of the [ schengen treaty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_agreement ) . 
  many members of the eu singed it . 
  but also norway , suisse and iceland did . 
  and they are not part of the eu . 
  on the other hand : the uk did n't sign it . 
  but are part of the eu . 
  even though the eu requires new members to sign it , the eu has nothing to do with the open borders . 
  oh well , i 'd probably serve multiple life sentences if i would be convicted in the us for all the shit i 'm allowed to do in the netherlands . 
  the rise of slovenian minimum wage is even more impressive . 
  even thourgh the crisis the min . 
  wage has been rising . 
  i hope it wo n't turn out to be counter-productive . 
  but slovenia having a higher min . 
  wage than spain and portugal is impressive . 
  also , you can clearly see the undermining of greek competitiveness happening in the years before the crisis . 
  without any explanation the min . 
  wage rises from equal to malta and spain to far above and back agian . 
  i loved nemo as a kid !, 
  not sure how old i was then . . but still . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/07/netherlands-builds-fake-mountain_n_947174.html ), 
  eu laws on this are just guidelines . 
  lots of countries have the government involved in large national matters . 
  in example , you have the nhs for health care where the dutch have ~ 20 private health care services . 
  not really . 
  they were not privatized but [ coporised ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporatization ) ( ? ), 
  the dutch government still owns the infrastructure ( [ prorail ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prorail ) . 
  and the largest operator ( [ ns ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nederlandse_spoorwegen ) ) . 
  some smaller lines in the outer parts of the country are operated by private companies like conexxion and veolia , but the government is still the main operator . 
  operator ** s ** ? 
  how many rail operators does one need . 
  i did n't hear the eu slamming sweden over taking in million of immigrants in the last years . 
  naturally some have to be sent back . 
  seems rather normal . 
  next !, 
  woohoo ( northern ) europe !, 
  i think not living 6 meter below sea level is still a better coast defence than what we have . 
  but since we ca n't move our entire country we do allright . 
  china has a history pretty much similar to the european one with competing kings and armies replacing the dynasty in charge every century or so . 
  some lasted longer ( qing ) some shorter . 
  the only difference is that china came out as one and europe did n't . 
  this is called ` bijstand ' in the netherlands . 
  if you do n't have a job , other income you get bijstand . 
  wich was $ 661 per month . 
  $ 926 if you have kids in 2013 . 
  it comes with a few rules though . 
  you have to look for and accept any form of work , you have to inform the government about pretty much everything about you and some things more . 
  yeah here to , but we dont have a system like the russians . 
  no but we have given names . 
  like i 'm named after my granddad ` jean ' and ` marie ' ( maria ; bible ) . 
  but these could also be random . 
  i did n't get it until i looked at your flair . 
  ah , thanks !, 
  unrelated quesiton : do all russians have a middle name ? 
  is this the hebrew daily mail ? 
  what an bs article . 
  we made our own country . 
  with weed and hookers . 
  most effective way of keeping the irish out . 
  do n't know , i 'm not one of them . 
  they just move from city to city ... 
   question : what are unclassified transactions ? 
  ( netherlands ) weed . 
  britain will be the best . 
  - [ the british ] ( http://www.cebr.com/contact/ ), 
  every news article that comes from anglo media will always be negative about france . 
  i have no idea why actually . 
  the economist has declared france dead like five times now . 
  see this one : [ link . 
  ] ( http://photo.europe1.fr/finances/economie/930x620-the-economist-une/23491147-1-fre-fr/930x620-the-economist-une_scalewidth_630.jpg ) i think it is just something the british and americans like to read about . 
  do n't have a source but it happened in my city in maastricht as well . 
  we kept seeing more and more beggars , gypsies and weird street musicians coming in . 
  at one point our mayor said that no one should give them money and that you should ask them to leave if you see one . 
  two weeks later they moved on to the next city . 
  1.09 in italy . 
  how ? 
  everytime i watch the serie a all the stadiums except maybe juve seem empty !, 
   i do n't know about the missiles or f-35 's but the trains we 'd certainly like , they ca n't be worse than the pendolinos we bought from the italians . 
  hahaha , want to put money on that ? 
  aaah ...
