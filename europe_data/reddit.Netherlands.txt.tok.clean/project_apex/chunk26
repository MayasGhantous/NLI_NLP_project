  most people have a card from one the locally big banks . 
  that bank of yours usually buys their cards from either ` vpay ' ( visa ) or maestro ( mastercard ) . 
  go ahead , check your bank card for one of these logos . 
   running joke : what do you get in belgium when you fail your driving test ? 
  a red number plate . 
  i 've heard that one here as well , haha . 
  best drivers benelux . 
  also : belgians ca n't drive on roundabouts . 
  it is known . 
  having too big to fail banks like many are now removes any market incentives for risk management . 
  you go bankrupt ? 
  bernanke or draghi will bail you out anyway . 
  this will put pressure on shareholders and other to force the management of a bank to be careful , dont pay out huge risk-enhancing bonusses etc. . 
   do you even target2 ? 
  [ being beaten by luxembourgh since 2012 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/target2_balances.png ), 
  the fund that banks are going to fill will cover the $ 100.000 . 
  this is pretty much the system that the netherlands had : banks cover each other . 
  and the bail-ins wo n't be payed for by depositors . 
  iirc this is the order that money will be lost when a bank files for bankruptcy : * first victims of a bankruptcy will be the shareholders ; * then the subordinated bondholder ; * then normal bondholders ; * then the people with deposits exceeding $ 100.000 ; * then the fund that the other banks fill ; * then ( if the fund is n't full yet or not sufficient ) the esm ( taxpayers ) . 
  seems like a better alternative than privatising the profits banks make in good years and socialising the losses when a bank fails . 
  haha , i remember that the whole world was angry when dijsselbloem [ said ] ( http://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0cdyqfjaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.marketwatch.com%2fstory%2fcyprus-lenders-agree-bailout-deal-reports-2013-03-24&amp;ei=tw2zuvmqmc_7yaomuigqag&amp;usg=afqjcnfa-xk3nqtoo9bvennhkd0kzzfuag&amp;sig2=fs1pg99hzqrtc7qgapmafa&amp;bvm=bv.58187178,d.bgq ) that the way he saved banks in cyprus would be a blueprint for the entire eu . 
  now they agreed to use that model anyway , good job . 
  pretty much the only dutch politician doing a good job at the moment . 
  he 's minfin , head of the eurogroup and he is practically prime minister as well since he is the one doing all the negotiating for the coalition . 
  indeed . 
  reverse engineering for the ~ ~ win ~ ~ profit !, 
  thats how all public contract are won more or less . 
  tell them you can sell them the product for $ x. 
  then , when they are hooked , say you need to up te price to $ x * y, 
  that 's pretty much the entire problem ; the us wanted the same plane for all purposes ( naxy , air force etc ) . 
  when they introduced the f-35 to the dutch public they said it could land vertically . 
  they did n't say we would n't get this type . 
  guees its get an expensive f-16 2.0 now . 
  it will be much cheaper to go to space when we can return with the same rocket . 
  `` duitsland '' in dutch !, 
   bwahahahahaha ... what does this even mean ? 
  means that all the people bashing gordon and the netherlands for being racist should rethink their comments . 
   like i said , the major injustice here is that this asshole still gets to be on tv while less privileged , more intelligent , genuinely funny people scrape by on passion at the local comedy club . 
  did they not let you through the auditions ? 
  the guy makes one joke and immediatly he is an asshole that does n't deserve to be on tv . 
  but of course less privileged ( ? 
  ) , more intellegent and , in your opinion , funny people at the comedy club should ? 
  your just repeating yourself saying that the joke was no good . 
  i think we agreed on that . 
  i 'm just saying that i missed all the americans when he made a joke about germans , catholics , gay people etc. . . as soon as something ethnic is joked about the place fills with self-righteous white americans claiming moral superiority over anyone who does n't agree with the ` if we do n't talk about it it does n't exist ' mentally that americans have concerning race and ethnicity . 
  in conclusion : did the guy make a bad / failed joke ? 
  yes . 
  does this mean he , or anyone in the netherlands , is racist ? 
  dude , i 'm not arguing that his joke was n't bad / failed . 
  i 'm just saying that the way ( american ) people respond to anything that has to do with ethnicity is disproportionate . 
  i mean come on . 
  how is this ` joke ' worse than other jokes , except for the fact that americans say so . 
  sooooo racist ... 
  you mean [ sleurhut ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=sleurhut&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ncewuphhesufyqof5ifw&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=806 ) ? 
  ^ ^ omg_thats_so_racist_not_all_dutch_own_a_caravan ... 
  rtl states they were sorry that people felt insulted by the ` joke ' . 
  but , still , i do n't think a bad joke is reason enough to fire him . 
  i understand that jokes about ethnic minorties are a taboo in the u.s. and other countries , but that is n't the case in the netherlands . 
   is it the same rtl as in germany ? 
  well this is rtl the netherlands of course , but they and the other rtl 's ( like the german one ) have the same mother company : [ rtl group ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/rtl_group ), 
   for example mocking politicians , bankers or lawyers is funny as they ( are assumed to ) have power , wealth and influence . 
  mocking a bin man or a cleaner is bullying . 
  who died and made you king of humour ? 
  so i guess jokes about catholics , gay people , muslims , limburgers , moroccans , germans , belgiums , americans are also banned from now on ? 
  we would n't want to insult somebody ... 
   no , they do n't . 
  the state will not come after you . 
  but if your employer does n't come after you , he implicitly condones your behaviour or at least seems not to have a problem with . 
  no it does n't . 
  gordon made his jokes on a personal title . 
  no one says that rtl ( the broadcaster ) or the producer of the show agree with his words . 
   quite frankly , france is stepping up here where other european countries have n't . 
  of course , they have their interests , but interests do n't necessarily mean one will have the reserve to take such action . 
  can someone explain to me why everyone simply accepts ` the fact ' that western countries have to step up when something goes wrong on the other side of the planet . 
  there is absolutely nothing that is in our own interest in a desert in mali . 
  after afghanistan and iraq you 'd think that the european countries would be a bit more sceptical about these ` interventions ' . 
   say stupid shit , you are a stupid shit . 
  do n't like it ? 
  do n't go on the tv . 
  i 'm sorry that i did n't comply with your rules mr. american . 
  from the website : `` the chinese can take a joke as long as both parties can laugh about it '' . 
  `` we now use the `` number 39 with rice '' as a [ ` geuzennaam ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reappropriation ) . '', 
  ah , the chinese are integrating well i see . 
  taking it in with humor in stead of drawing the racism card . 
  he also said to a german contestant : `` where is my bike ? '' . 
  in ww2 many germans took bicycles from dutch people for their own . 
  but i guess making a ww2 joke to a german is n't as bad as saying `` number 39 with rice '' . 
   whether or not he should be fired is completely separate from the ` freedom of press ' argument . 
  it 's really not . 
  the us and others always claim to have full freedom of speech but as soon as you say ` ass ' , ` fuck , or something insulting the entire country forgets about your freedom of speech i guess . 
  exactly . 
  but the clips where he insults yound , old , white and whatever did n't go viral . 
  because only bad jokes aimed at ethnic minorities are a no-no . 
  q : `` why are you fins the happiest people on earth ? '' '', 
  a : ` because we are always # 1 on results from surveys ! ', 
  i was referring to something that was a hype in the media some time ago : everything we did would be be compared to finland . 
  al-jazeera is qatari based for crying out loud . 
  criticising europe , lol . 
  great , where is iran , saudi-arabia , oman , qatar , uae , bahrein on that list ? 
  of all the countries that the article lists only iraq is a rich oil country , and they are still recovering from a 10 year occupation , they have massive problems in their country .
