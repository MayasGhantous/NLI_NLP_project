  and yet they try to help those people the best way they can . 
  there is billions and billions of oil money and enough room to store billions of people in the middle east . 
  they always shout that they 're sunni of shiite ` brothers ' . 
  well , help them out then . 
  it has become a dangerous precedent that the west is somehow expected to take in poor peolpe with no chance of succesfully integrating in our societies . 
  we allready do that ; we wo n't complain when you guys play police officer of the world and in return you guys pay for our rocket shield and defense spending . 
  for the sake of not having to pay for our military ; please elect an neo-conservative republican for president in 2016 . 
  hey look , a compartive list . 
  let 's see who is better than the neth . . goddamnit not finland again . 
  not anymore . 
  they invented a final solution . 
  mhhh indeed . 
  wel guys , any suggestions on how to fix that ? 
  problem -  try to legalize it -  no 100 % support for that -  try and find sollution -  can not agree on legalising or criminalising -  legalise the sale -  keep production illegal -  fund criminal networks this way -  keep this `` sollution '' for 30 years . 
  the netherlands : problem -----  talk with coalition --  talk some more --  talk with unions -----  talk with employers -----  ask pressure groups for their opinion ------  debate about it on national tv -----  let media debate it --  talk with the senate ------  xxxxxx -----  xxxxxxxxxx -------  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ------  possible solution . 
  i mean , the `` poldering '' has brought us some good but now it 's just ridiculous . 
  no one wants to decide anything , afraid that someone is opposed to one part of something they might eventually do . 
  and i 'm pretty sure more people speak [ limburgs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_netherlands ) than frisian . 
  altough it is recognized as a regional language it does not have the status co-official language like frisian . 
  having the ukraine as part of the eu means russia and gazprom can put less pressure on it for the gas passing through the country . 
  russia is trying to become more powerfull and its using its vast resources in oil and gas to do it . 
  thats not good for europe so any country taking out of the influencial sphere of russia is good for europe . 
  esppecially since a lot of the gas travelling to europe from russia passes through the ukraine . 
   or am i missing something ? 
  yeah . 
  most of europe is fuelled by russian natural gas that travels to europe trhrough pipelines in the ukraine . 
   historically , even countries like switzerland and the us , with strong `` state/canton rights '' traditions had stepped in to give vote to women or black people in parts of the country where the minority of the population constituted the majority of the population able to vote . 
  difference is that these are countries and their citizens see them as one country . 
  while some small states or cantons refuse to change , they fully accept that they are part of a bigger society . 
  this is not the case in the eu . 
  no one , except some politicians and idealists , see themselves as citizen of the eu first . 
  while your right that sometimes some parts need a little push to change ( and regarding black people in the us , or women in switzerland ) , i think that if the media and countries acted the same way towards poland back then as they do to russia today , that the changes that poland has made would n't be there and would n't be accepted by the society . 
   it is obvious that you cant push something from the top and then it just works . 
  but i think human rights is exactly the kind of thing that should be pushed from the top and there have been many improvements in this in the last fifty years because of the eu and the un . 
  all the countries that joined the eu and un did so voluntarely . 
  and the un does n't force anything on its members ( saudi arabia is a member of the [ women rights council ] ( http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/11/10/iran_blocked_but_saudi_arabia_accepted_for_un_women_board#sthash.ujg98fjf.dpbs ) , lol ) . 
  i hope you do get that i 'm not agianst speaking out for human rights . 
  but if you * really * want to change the way certain societies look at these subjects , in stead of wanting to ` send a signal ' or get on tv as politician , then you should know that your only being counterproductive when you bash or boycot them . 
   did civil rights legislation come from inside america ? 
  or was it forced down by the government with great resistance from southern states ? 
  not really comparable . 
  but it did come from within because they ( north and south ) are one country . 
   sure were not going to invade these countries , but these countries should realise theyre out of line with the world ~ ~ we ~ ~ ** i ** live in . 
  if you say it like this than the west is [ out of line with the world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index#democracy_index_by_regime_type ) . 
  not the other way around . 
  its the same as those western ngo 's trying to bash saudi arabia for not letting women drive . 
  it is really not going to change until they ( the saudi 's ) change their opinion about it . 
  and now the saudi officials simply say : ` see !, 
  the west wants to change us !, 
  we must not let them '' anyway . 
  good luck with bashing russia . 
  i 'm sure it will satisfy yourself and those around you because ` you did something about it ' . 
  the gay people in russia sure wo n't be better off . 
  and just to clarify : i 'm all * in favour * of gay rights . 
  you just have to realise that the way most western societies try to enforce it works counterproductive . 
   if you see human dignity as a fundamental right , then you would n't leave it up to national governments to uphold . 
  one of the reasons i 'm pro-eu is because it puts more pressure on national governments to uphold human rights treaties and the echr . 
  that does n't work . 
  people wo n't accept a foreign institution or country to pressure them into changing their culture . 
  i understand that you feel like it 's needed , and tackling homophobia needs to happen . 
  but you have to realise that a cultural change , wich is what we are after , can only come from within and from the ground up . 
  it can never go the other way around . 
  you can try and force it on a country or population but all that you will do is give them the feeling they are pushed into a corner . 
  lets look at two countries : poland and russia . 
  when poland joined the eu it was more homophobic than it is now . 
  the catholic churche has a significant influence there and 20 years ago , you really did n't want to live in poland as a gay person . 
  but !, 
  that is changing , people are more open to the idea of gay people and a political party even made it one of their slogans !, 
  the eu did n't do much for it . 
  there were no officials boycotting poland , no extreme media coverage , no protests . 
  europe did n't force poland to change its laws or culture . 
  it merely showed them that accepting gay people * does n't * ruin your society . 
  ** europe led by example ! ** . 
  and now poland is slowly moving towards the west regarding the acceptance of gay people . 
  the road is long , but they are taking the steps . 
  now take russia : the entire western society , media , officials and ngo 's are constantly bashing russia and putin for its homophobic laws . 
  people are even boycotting the olympics , wich should be a very proud moment for a country and its people to host . 
  as a result putin can show himself as ` the defender of russian culture ' . 
  i mean , you have to understand that , similar to poland some decades ago , 80 % of the russian people are anti-gay . 
  and when you constantly bash russia for it in the media you push the russian people in a corner . 
  the boycotting , media attention , bashing , ** it is a constant stream of propaganda opportunities for putin . 
  ** and with every news item you push russia and , more important , the russian people away from the west and away from liberal views towards gay people and gay marriage . 
  ** constantly pointed out that a country is ` wrong ' in your eyes * sounds * like a good idea , but it is the most counterproductive thing you can do if you really want gay people to have it better in russia . 
  that said : ** no . 
  it is never a good idea to try and have some ` supranational ' ( the eu is even seen as something foreign to most of its inhabitants ) try and force human rights on others . 
   the mere mention of the ukip as anything more than the `` white rich male '' gentlemans club shows as much . 
  dude , what ? 
  the idea is good . 
  many people do n't know what certain parties stand for . 
  however , a simple yes , neutral or no answer is really insuffici\u00ebnt on an eu level . 
  take this :  `` should maternity leave on full pay be extended from 14 to 20 weeks across the eu ? '', 
  i think maternity leave could be extended , especially in the netherlands . 
  but i had to answer `` no '' because i have no idea why this has to be implemented at eu level . 
  national countries can do this just fine . 
  but since i voted `` no '' they pool me with people who are agianst extended maternity leave . 
   `` should the eu continue to spend money on development aid to poor countries ? '', 
  i 'm not agianst aid . 
  but i was inclined to vote `` no '' because , again , there is no point here . 
  national government already have programs in place for aid . 
  and there is no benefit in raising this to an eu level .
