   `` should the eu encourage measures to tackle homophobia ? '', 
  again , i 'm not agianst tackling homophobia . 
  but there is no point in doing this eu wide . 
  every country has a different culture and national governments are better at this than the eu . 
  but if i vote no i will be pooled with homophobic mep 's . 
   `` should the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement ( acta ) be adopted ? '', 
  this is just ridiculous . 
  the eu has absolutely no power to ratify treaty 's with other nations . 
  the dutch parliament rejected acta on its own . 
  as did the polish and others . 
  so it really does n't matter if what the ep votes ... 
  so for the non-dutch people , i get to choose from : 1 . 
  sp : radical left-wing party that is aprt of the [ gue/ngl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_united_left%e2%80%93nordic_green_left ) who are agianst capitalism and is formed by ( former ) communist parties . 
  pvv : radical right-wing party that think islam is a fascist ideology and that has just bonded with front national ( anti-semetic party ) , lega nord ( italian right-wing extremists ) and other right-wing parties . 
  thank god for democracy . 
  what a weird chart . 
  how did they select the cities ? 
  did they just select a big city in each country that had the best score ? 
  why did they use paris for france and stuttgart \u00e1nd berlin for germany ? 
  why is only turin for italy while listing 4 spanish cities ? 
  seems random ... 
  name some ? 
   when one of the fractions gets a big victory in the european elections , it will be very difficult for the european council to not establish that person as the new president of the european commission . 
  yeay , guy verhofstad as eu president . 
  lol !, 
  i mean , no disrespect but his ideas about a federal europe could not be further away from the people as it is . 
  and , lets be honoust , the only only eu body that is calling any shots is the eurogroup . 
  oh man i 'm so siced to vote for a pan-european body that has absolutely no right of initiative !, 
  / endrant in all seriousness : i do n't think the turnout is going to be good . 
  i consider myself to be politically aware but i do n't really see a point in voting . 
  every party is filled with europhiles that are blind to criticism . 
  even the parties in the netherlands that call themselves ` eurosceptic ' are allianced with guy verhofstad . 
  the only parties that are not europhile are the right win extremist and i 'm definitely not voting for them . 
  the only viable option would be ukip . 
  but since you can only vote for people from your own country ( wich goes completely agianst all european integration ideas ) , there is really no point . 
  like the british !, 
  there is a bridge / tunnle between denmark and sweden . 
  [ fyi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%98resund_bridge ), 
  til scandinavia is not europe . 
  i can actually make up what they are trying to say when reading this . 
  tak !, 
  ^ goes ^ back ^ to ^ watching ^ borgen, 
  but do n't you think there is a difference in printing money to counter appreciation vs. printing money ( buying bonds from banks ) so that banks can lend out more ? 
  you ca n't argue that the qe in the us is to ` counter ' a appreciated dollar , or am i just plain wrong here ? 
  well , my point was that there is a difference in printing money to maintain a stable currency and printing money to help your political goals ( war , better economy etc. . ) . 
  with the first you print money to trade in the currency markets while in the second you print money to spend it in the real economy , wich causes inflation . 
  the us government does n't print money themselves , they let the fed print it and then borrow it from them . 
  then the us government throws this at the real economy to try to force it to grow . 
  anyway , even though they do print money , they ( the germans ) are opposed to a central bank that helps the government achieve its political goals . 
   think about these things for 5 minutes instead of spouting `` common sense '' cliches maybe i should clarify : i did n't mean that the bundesbank does not , ever , print any money . 
  i meant that germany is opposed to large qe programs that have been going on in the uk , the us and japan . 
   and then they would print money to depreciate it . 
  germany does not print money . 
  ^ anymore ^ since ^ the ^ weimar ^ republic ) . 
  i did not expect that in texas . 
  damn prejudices ... 
  we are not sure yet about our pm ... 
  sure , these former ussr countries have some great potential . 
  poland and the baltic states are great examples , especially poland is catching up with the west at an enourmous speed . 
  and , it might cost some money at first to integrate them etc but in the long run everyone would profit . 
  plus they could n't really cost us more than some other countries in the eu who have never been communist in the first place . 
  edit : plus : the women !, 
  lets say i am the ns ( national railroads of holland ) : option 1 : we order tgv trains from france wich has a very good high speed rail network with 20 years experience . 
  option 2 : we order ice trains from germany who have been proven to work and can ride up to 300km/h . 
  option 3 : we order a custom made train from some unknown company in italy because they say they can do it for the lowest price . 
  our ns : option 3 !, 
  its the cheapest !, 
  well , this happens in the netherlands as well . 
  for some reason our national train company ordered high speed trains in italy ( i would n't order a fucking bike from an italian factory ) and they have not worked for a week . 
  the belgians dropped out of the joint project and now we can pay the bill . 
  edit : if you governemnt or semi-government ever orders something from [ ansaldobreda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ansaldobreda ) , for the love of public finance , stop them !, 
  it is `` ukraine '' not `` the ukraine '' . 
   well obviously introducing a common currency without a common economic policy was a bad idea for many $ - countries . 
  we have a common economic policy , they 're called the [ maastricht criteria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euro_convergence_criteria ), 
  poor living conditions were not the only problems 150 years ago . 
  in a capitalistic society without government intervention : - capital will flow to a small portion of the people ( money generates money ) - people who have a lot of capital will be able to use this to influence the democratic process of a society . 
  - social mobility will be low . 
  you can easily see how more regulated countries ( nordic countries ) have less of these problems than less regulated ( uk and in greater extend the us ) countries . 
   there was no better time for him to have lived than 150 years ago . 
  the shocking part is that we did n't learn from it and sometimes still let capitalism run its course and then act suprised when the income/wealth gap gets bigger , social mobility stagnates etc. . . 
   it 's not viable though . 
  it is . 
  crisis do n't just happen . 
  they have a , often very complex , origin . 
  countries should know these can occur and make preparations . 
  you are correct . 
  however , in a subreddit like this and in daily life many people , including me , think : market-economy = = capitalism . 
  there are a lot of companies who , in some form , put the employees of their company in charge . 
  [ handelsbanken ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/handelsbanken ) has a profit-sharing scheme that also has to make sure employees are interested in the long-term condition of the bank . 
  the second largest dutch company ( oil , of course ) has a structure where some ~ 400 employees hold all the shares and they get dividend and sell their shares back to the company when they leave the company . 
  this is a great incentive to reduce risk since you are betting / investing with your own and your friends money in stead of someone you do n't know . 
  anyway , my point is : these ` goals ' you want can easily be achieved in a capitalistic environment . 
  they are not outdated . 
  it 's just that socialism , in this age , means having a capitalistic environment as ** fundation ** for your society . 
  ** not ** as endproduct . 
  socialism in the netherlands meands to have a government that intervenes in the market-economy to tackle some fundamental flawes in the capitalistic system . 
  marx described pretty accurately what happens in you let capitalism run its course without any or much government intervention . 
  and he did this 150 years ago . 
  not the point . 
  the point is that the word `` europhile '' is used to describe people who are in favour of the european union as an institution .
