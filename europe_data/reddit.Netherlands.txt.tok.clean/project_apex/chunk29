  this is / r/europe , not / r/eu . 
  since your german anyway : how * would * you build a beach car ? 
   wikipedia was blocked wait , what ? 
  and that 's coming from a guy in a former-soviet country . 
  that 's saying something , i guess . . 
  haha . 
  did n't see this coming !, 
  lol . 
  ` reich ' has been tried . 
  did n't work out . 
  instant update : greece and macadonia do n't really get along either . 
  not-so-instant update : ` dutch belgium ' is called flanders and the ` french belgium ' is called wallonia . 
  i would like some context please ... where does one find these people . . 
  depends on where you live . 
  in big cities socials housing can be flats or appartments but most social houses in my city are houses where most people would n't mind living . 
  these are socials houses in [ amsterdam ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=sociale+huurwoning+nederland&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=e--futfjnma00qxl6odiba&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1382&amp;bih=774#hl=nl&amp;q=sociale+huurwoning+amsterdam&amp;tbm=isch ) , the largest city in the netherlands . 
  the reason that it is hard to find a social home is because they are too good . 
  social homes were build as a stepping stone to owning your own house . 
  however , the co\u00f6perations did a pretty good job building social homes that are of the same standards as normal low income housing . 
  because of this people are fine where they are for their $ 430 a month . 
  so in stead of trying to force these people out your should just offer them the house at a reasonable price . 
  this way the residents can build up income and the govwernment can lower its debt with money they get from partly selling their $ 380 billion assets . 
  the low home ownership in the netherlands is partially due to the fact that the government intervenes in a huge way . 
  social housing co\u00f6perations in the netherlands own 2.4 million houses ( 30 % of all houses ) with a total net worth of [ $ 380 billion ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/woningcorporatie#feiten_en_cijfers ) . 
  these avarage rent for these social houses is $ 430 , - wich is incredibly low for the netherlands . 
  this way it is not lucrative for these people to buy the house they live in . 
  the thing that annoys me the most about the eu government is that no one really knows its role . 
  they do n't have clear objectives or boundries . 
  they make policies regarding all subjects , even when it is very clear that there is no point in making eu-wide laws on this subject . 
  we had a pretty good co\u00f6perative , intergovernmental eu that would make policies based on concensus and co\u00f6peration between member states . 
  no one asked for a supranational government but we are rolled into it by the same method they use in the us : fear . 
  in stead of ` terrorism ' , politicians in the eu use ` economic disaster ' , ` zombie banks ' , ` collaps of the euro ' as arguments to push for a more powerfull and supranational eu . 
  we gave the eu power to check our national budget , we 're getting a banking union ( no idea why a banking union would fix things , look at the us ) , the eu is forcing a neo-liberal agenda on national governments in greece , spain and portugal . 
  these countries are forced to sell government owned enterprises ( including water companies , wtf ? 
  ) , reduce labour rights , increase market economies , etc. . 
  the ecb , the imf , the european commission are all _ not _ elected officials . 
  they are appointed by the 27 nation states after the usual debates and comprises . 
  the only elected eu body , the ep , has been giving absolutely no influence during the crisis . 
   that is not true . 
  people who think that the eu is n't working properly and therefore we should ditch the whole thing are called euroskeptics . 
  a lot of europhiles agree that shit ai n't working properly and we still need to tweek it this way or that way . 
  does n't need to be changed , it needs to be redesigned from the ground up . 
  the current structure was build shortly after the eu was founded . 
  everyone got some seats in the parliament , you can only vote for your own parliamentarians ( nice eu spirit ) , every country gets a commissioner , etc. . nowadays with 500 + million people and 28 countries this is really forming a bottleneck . 
  i mean we make up new eu commissions so we can give new countries a commissioner ... every heard of the commissioner for ` home affairs ' ? 
   i think this is tied somewhat to the amount of power the ep has . 
   i think expanding the ep 's role might draw some attention from the media . 
  i do think that an more powerfull ep would draw more attention . 
  but honoustly , the current ep 's are completely out of line with national politics and the overall political climate in the eu . 
  ep 's tend to be very pro-eu and think that everything is better when done at a eu wide level . 
  accompanied by the recent neo-capitalistic mindset this is potentially very dangerous ( hi portugals water companies ) . 
   but i 'm curious . 
  would you want an eu-level bbc , or it 's just that you are frustrated that the rivate sector is n't interested ? 
  an eu level bbc would n't work , i mean , yes we are europeans but we are all dutch , french or romanian first ... that 's no shame , but we just should n't pretend that getting rid of physicall borders will make cultural borders fade . 
  but why ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i think we should all work together , but as we have clearly seen , there are huge economical and cultural differences in the eu . 
  personally , i think we should seperate the ` european integration ' debate from the ` future of the eu ' debate . 
  people who say that the eu ( as an institution ) is n't working properly are framed as nationalists and eurosceptics . 
  because of this we ca n't have a normal debate about the checks and balances in the eu system , because people think that we want to abondon eu co\u00f6peration . 
  i think working together as equals in europe is great . 
  i just think the eu is highly flawed . 
  there is no point in having a 750 people big eu parliament if do n't have legislative initiative . 
  there is no democratic basis for the eu commission and with less than 43 % of the people turning up to vote for the eu parliament ( 20 % in slovakia and under 50 % in 18 out of the 27 members ) , [ it lacks democratic ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/000cdcd9d4/turnout-%281979-2009%29.html ) basis as well . 
  there is also no `` eu media '' that can check the government . 
  there are 27 different national media outlets that sometimes report on the eu , but it is nowhere near the amount of time they put into checking their own government . 
  no one wants a basic eu law . 
  it 's funny because we had a referendum about the eu constitution that was turned down but our government declined the ` advice ' and renamed it as the lisbon treaty and signed it without asking the people again . 
  winter is coming . 
  far right and euro-sceptic will win . 
  this is ukip , pvv , front national , true fins , vlaams belang ( of blok ? 
  i do n't think the euro crisis is the biggest contributor to this . 
  i think most of the anti-euro feelings and euro-scepticism comes from the fact that the ideologies of a lot of europarliamentarians are completely out of line with public thinking . 
  even today there the front-runners of the european parties are federalists like guy verhofstad , martin schulz etc. . . 
  this kind of thinking and pushing for a federal eu or a us of e is what scares people away . 
  the people do n't necessarilywant to go back to national currencies or abondon the eu , but they sure as hell are n't willing to move forward with the eu at this time . 
  and if the current leaders of the eu parties do n't accept this , they will lose the elections big time . 
  photolithography systems for the semiconductor industry - the netherlands, 
  have to agree . 
  democracy : suisse, 
  niederlande - there is no direct democracy here . 
  we had one referendum about the new eu constitution . 
  was rejected with 62 % voting agianst in 2005 . 
  then they named it ` lisbon treaty ' and implemented it anyway - without consent from the population . 
  i would really love it to just go swiss , give the people the right to organise a ( binding ) referendum . 
  the oil rig is russian , lol !, 
  indeed !, 
  this is in russia ... 
  i really think we should tone it down . 
  i do n't see why russia does n't have the right to arrest foreign activists that enter their oil rigs , twice . 
  if russians would enter our oil platforms i expect them to be arrested too . 
  ^ / / unpopular ^ opinion ^ thingy, 
  i do n't think the ice sheet on greenland floats ... thats the north pole ice sheet . 
  but that 's not what i was talking about though . 
  i once read / heard that if the [ ice sheet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice_sheet ) on ( or in ? ), 
  greenland would melt that it would n't make the oceans near europe rise as much as projected because the mass of the current ice sheet on greenland is so great that it affects the tides . 
  when the ice sheet dissappears so will the gravitational influence of it . 
  probably not the best description and i do n't know if the source i got it from was credible ... can anyone confirm this ? 
  or confirm it is not true ? 
  edit : gravital = gravitational, 
  this google translate does a pretty good job .
