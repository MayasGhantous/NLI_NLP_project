  same in nl . 
  we call it ` tutoyeren ' ( where would that word come from ? ), 
  if you adress someone with jij ( tu ) or other informal words . 
   and that the church in my city centre is casually some 600 years old . 
  [ that 's it ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basilica_of_our_lady,_maastricht ), 
  this is n't a problem . 
  my phone for example comes with a charger ( microusb ) with an output of 4,5 a. 
  but it only does this when it is plugged into a phone that supports this turbo-charger . 
  if it does n't then it puts out 1,5 a. 
  if you would put 4,5 a into a regular htc or blackbarry it would burn through the battery in no time . 
  so you can have one charger for different needs . 
  it does actually . 
  you ca n't not enforce a law for years and suddenly arrest someone for it when you feel like it . 
  you ether enforce the law or you do n't . 
   in every war there are faction in the invaded country that are sympathetic towards the invader . 
  being dutch i know all about this ...  cortez had aztec allies too , and the principle of divide et impera was coined by caesar . . 
  the big difference being that cortez conquered the mayan and aztec states for * the spanish crown * . 
  while william just conquered england for himself . 
   he used his position to leverage british resources to serve dutch interests anyway . 
  yep . 
  because he gave parliament more power they could end the monopoly that the ( english ) east india company had on spice trade and other stuff . 
  this pretty much enabled the dutch east india company to become the most valueable company ever ( still is today , [ calculated in 2014 usd ] ( https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/photos/most-valuable-companies-ever-adjusted-for-inflation-1351801906-slideshow/most-valuable-companies-in-history-adjusted-for-inflation-photo--1113431046.html ) ) . 
  from the [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_east_india_company#growth ) :  by 1669 , the voc was the richest private company the world had ever seen , with over 150 merchant ships , 40 warships , 50,000 employees , a private army of 10,000 soldiers , and a dividend payment of 40 % on the original investment . 
  and people think private companies today are powerful ^ ^, 
  and ukraine should be russian flag . 
  not really an invasion . 
  part of the english parliament at the time * wanted * william of orange / willem iii to take over because the king at the time ( stuart dynasty , iirc ) was trying to take back power from parliament . 
  then when woo / w3 took over he granted the parliament the powers that they wanted and in return parliament made him king / accepted him as king . 
  and thus the ** parliamentary democracy ** was introduced to the world . 
  edit : ok . 
  it might be an invasion . 
  might be not . 
  it sure was n't an occupation / annexation . 
  willem came to conquer the throne ** for himself ** . 
  not for the netherlands . 
  how about having the military posting at train stations for [ security ] ( http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/23127500/___zet_leger_in_op_stations___.html ) ? 
  ( in dutch ) . 
  i 'm not saying that is is n't a huge treath to the region . 
  i 'm saying its treath to dutch society is vastly overstated in dutch media . 
  they 're acting like is took over flanders and luxembourgh rather than syria and iraq . 
  it is a woman who is ( unreasonably ) afraid of a mouse that says is . 
  last week our government and media have started an almost american campaign of fear for is . 
  they even said to avoid trainstations and public places . 
  all tv shows that cover actuality have spend their entire show on how we are all going to die from is because our country participates in the international coalition . 
  one right-wing politician even suggested to post armed soldiers at stations ... [ here in dutch ] ( http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/23127500/___zet_leger_in_op_stations___.html ), 
  people are animals . 
  group animals to be precise . 
  all the way from your football team , to your religion , to your city , to your country you are part of groups . 
  these groups come natural or are formed because of similar interests . 
  evolutionairy you are very easily stimulated to wanting to fight when your group is , or seems to be , under attack . 
  that is why russia is portraying the west as homo 's that want to destroy their culture . 
  that is why is decapitates us/uk citizens . 
  that is why western governments keep repeating that we are ` under attack ' from is . 
  give people an enemy and they 'll fight your cause . 
  seems to be the eu / ilo standard . 
  because the nl is at 7,0 % here and with our national standard it is [ 8,0 % ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/menu/cijfers/default.htm ), 
   making the eu adopt a common policy hehe . 
  in that case : the bahamas . 
  iran / persia has the highest social capital of the middle east ( after israel ) . 
  you can not compare migrants from iran , who mostly flee the regime , to unskilled / uneducated migrants from turkey or morocco . 
  you 're kidding , right ? 
   stimulus spending works fine in the usa . 
  ur just creating another bubble on wall st. , 
   good point but bailing out the piigs countries `` only '' cost $ 600 billion over 3 years so far , yes . 
  france refuses to enact reforms and wants the ecb to print money ( more cheap credit will solve the cheap credit crisis !! ), 
  we are not really patriots . 
  we mostly think our country is [ ok ] ( http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4465417/patriotism_around_the_world_clean.png ) . 
  and these low-interest have made sure that not only the government but also private citizens have a lot of debt . 
  same way the euro enabled this for piigs . 
  i suggest a new molotov ribbentrop pact !, 
  annex all the belgium !, 
  that 's ok . we have room for a couple of million more . 
   anti-russia jerk . 
  anti-putin . 
  * i do n't think anyone here thinks the russian people are evil . 
  like they want this ... 
  `` when can you have troops here for apologising to occupied nations during the cold war ? '', 
   well , how fast would nato be able to react , if taken by surprise ? 
  it will take exactly 0,5 seconds for nato to crash the russian stock markets , disrupt electricity grids and dump so much roebels the weimar republic would be ashamed . 
  if i can mark every person living in amsterdam that was n't born inside amsterdam but another part of the netherlands as immigrant then its `` immigration '' percentage would be rather high as well . 
  there has been a rather un-dutch media campaign agianst russia , putin and everything russian in the nl . 
  this is the result , pretty much . 
   their worldview , not others , therefore it would n't be brainwashing . 
  it is the same . 
  billions of people on this planet think that there is a guy sitting on a cloud deciding over everything that happens down on earth . 
  and the only reason they think this is because they were told it is so . 
  it is indeed their honest worldview that this is true , just like these girls believe there is ` holy ' war going on that they must join . 
  simply because others told them so . 
   why do you think it 's not just their own honest ( retarded ) worldview ? 
  it is their honest worldview now . 
  that 's what brainwashing is . 
  sorry for the godwin but you as a german should know how effective it is ... 
  mhh weird . 
  they look kind off , well , normal . 
  usually these recruiters target lonely , friendless kids . 
  take them under their wing , make them feel like they belong somewhere , have a purpose in life and slowly radicalise them . 
  of course a picture does n't show personality but usually girls looking like this are popular and are very hard to persuade into a radical corner ... oh well , i 'm sorry for the parents ... ca n't imagine how they must feel . 
   you wanted it so bad you requested to be ruled by a dutch king the parliament requested him to take over because their king had absolutist pretentions . 
  the new ( dutch/english ) king then , according to good dutch tradition , negotiated his new position in the power balance .
