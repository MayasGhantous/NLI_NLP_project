  dutch tv showed dutch lorries with meat driving in france being looted by french farmers . 
  i have no clue how they het away with this fucking bullshit . 
  any other group of people doing this would be instantly arrested . 
  i even saw hollande on tv saying he agrees with the farmers . 
  what the fuck is wrong with that president . 
  grow some balls . 
  you can , it is called a mortgage . 
   the funds will be available for investment projects [ . . ] in infrastructure , small businesses , education , youth employment and telecoms . 
  so it can basically be invested in whatever the fuck the politicians want . 
  who will check these investments ? 
  with 315 billion euro 's you could almost give everyone in southern europe solar panels . 
  or entire northern europe fiber internet . 
  but now it seems it will be invested in a 1001 small sized projects that local politicians get to pick . 
  edit : as / u/lustschloss points out the actual investement from the eu is 15bn from the eu budget and 6bn from the eib . 
  this money is then leveraged 15 times to reach the 315bn euros as promised . 
  this basically means that we are borrowing money as usual . 
  only this time the risk is the eu 's and not the individual countries to bear . 
  so ... congrats , you all just got euro-bonds anyway . 
   how long those troops should have stayed there if pulling them back now is/was poor decision ? 
  until the iraqi 's had an army that could n't be defeated by some fnatics with ak 's that want to declare their own state ? 
  yes that was a really bad decicion but once it was made it was obama who made another bad decision : pulling the troops back . 
  it was one of his campaign promises and if he did n't want to go they would n't have gone . 
  the iraqi 's also did n't invite them in , so what the iraqi 's want is not really decisive . 
  not my fault you ca n't pronounce the h , , 
  well , i am starting this trend today then !, 
  for all you foreign lot : ** ho ** tel , ** re ** staurant , ** ca ** fe . 
  horeca is used to describe all the industries in one go, 
  `` data from 2007 '' . 
  8 years can change a lot ... 
  there have been serious anti-smoking campaigns , a general ban on smoking in horeca , and higher prices per cigarette in the netherlands since 2007 . 
  i 'm sure this has effect . 
  this is actually not true . 
  from 2006-2011 syria experienced one of the worst droughts in its history and many people lost their entire livelihood . 
  [ click here ] ( http://climateandsecurity.org/2012/02/29/syria-climate-change-drought-and-social-unrest/ ) for more info on that . 
  as a result of that enourmous drought there were many social unrest and tension building up as farmers where relocating to the cities at a massive rate . 
  [ click ] ( http://www.irinnews.org/report/85963/syria-drought-driving-farmers-to-the-cities ) . 
  obviously when a large portion of the populous loses their income and goes to the cities to find work this results in heavy social unrest when the government does n't or ca n't provide this . 
  this all happened in 2009 and before . 
  add a few years of this tension and the arab spring was the last spark needed to ignite the whole situation . 
  it would 've happened without it i am sure , just a bit later maybe . 
  and the fact that iraq no longer had a decent army ( the us disbanded it in 2003 ) created a perfect power vacuum in the sunni areas of syria and iraq for is to jump into . 
  tl ; dr : not arab spring but a drought stretching from 2006 to 2011 is the reason their is now a civil war in syria . 
  obama pulling his troops out of iraq is the reason isis exists ... 
  i mean further back it can be directly linked to bush dissolving the iraqi army in 2003 but when obama came into office he should 've realised that iraq was in no way ready to stand on its own feet . 
  we do n't dislike the greeks . 
  i mean , argentina defaulted and that does n't really change my opinion of argentinians . 
  we just hate the fact that we joined a club where countries have to pay for other countries when they fail . 
  we we 're explicitly told that the eu was ** not ever ** to do this and now they do it anyway . 
  so we are just mad at our own politicians who lied , and our politicians deflect this and channel our anger towards those ` lazy greeks ' . 
  aah , another wagon on the unstoppable federal eu train . 
  what this cartoon really says is that we need a fiscal union that makes for a continuous transfer of wealth from north to south rather than the current transfers we have now . 
  pretty sure at least part of this is thanks to is spreaking terror in the african mediterranian countries . 
  at least from hollands lots of people who used to go their ( tunis , libya , egypt ) are now going to spain . 
  and wood burns faster :p pros and cons ... 
  on top of the war they gave ukraine aids . 
  wtf ? 
  your image of the us might be biased . 
  yep but wooden houses are bigger for the same money . 
  and since land in the us is cheap you can build yourself a big house . 
  wooden houses can have its charm too , stone is n't everything . 
  although it is considirable more durable . 
  but a wooden house is easier to remove and build a new one ... 
  mhhh . 
  build a house that is twice as expensive , or buy an ac ? 
  what do you think will happen ? 
  if you live in florida in a wooden house or in southern spain in an old stone house makes a lot of difference in your need for an ac . 
  this depends heavily on the sector you work in . 
  if you are technical , in it , accountancy or many many others they practically give you a long-term contract straight from uni . 
   ridiculous labor laws . 
  the harder it is to fire someone the harder decision it is to hire . 
  this is such a stubborn neo liberal urban legend . 
  it is comepletely false ... netherlands and other countries like japan have ridiculously strict labor laws . 
  in the netherlands you ca n't even fire someone with a contract without permission from the regulatory government agency . 
  ( except when they have temporary contracts or they do something like stealing ) . 
  and we have a low unemployment rate despite our housing bubble . 
  b-b-b-but invisible hand of the market ? 
  work more = earn more !, 
  live to work !, 
  spain already had that part of the debt only it was household debt back then and with the housing crash it got transferred to the government . 
   in absolute numbers it 's disgustingly big . 
  yes and greece 's is fucking small in absolute numbers . 
  that 's why we use percentages lol . 
  haha dutch humor high-five !, 
  it 's not even 100 % of gdp lol . 
  no where near what greece has . 
   why do you say that ? 
  it 's a popular thing to say among anglo newsmedia . 
  magazines and newspaper like the economist , wsj and nyt declare france economically dead once every two weeks or so . 
  nothing that one of them predicted has even been remotely true since 2008 so it 's mostly their own reputation that is being killed rather than the french economy . 
  oh lol they actually did . 
  just googled it . 
  i thought he was messing with the scots . 
   i remember north england having a referendum lol, 
  they are , espacially in the catholic part of the country , closing down churches and bisdoms extremely fast . 
  they have to sell off a lot of property in order to not default . 
   it also gets money from the federal and state government , for infrastructure , schools , policing and other programs . 
  this is the reason i ( and many with me ) do n't want a fiscal union . 
  we do n't want some super sized 500 million + government deciding who gets what and when . 
  it will be as corrupt as your congress within a decade and will leave everyone ( well maybe except greece ) off worse . 
   monetary union without fiscal union wo n't work .
