  says who ? 
  every few years someone in europe says `` x wo n't work without y '' and then we get y , and they will say we need z too , and all other letters until we are the united states of europe . 
  it worked for 10 years and it will continu to work if countries simply stuck to the agreements they make . 
  true , and i do feel sorry for the greek people , i 'm sure they would 've voted differently if they knew they had to pay all that borrowed money back . 
  the problem is : we never agreed to have a union where the stronger members have to carry the weakest . 
  the eu was never meant as a mechanism to transfer wealth north -  south . 
  and yet it is exactly that , today . 
  pretty sure they let detroit simply default . 
  as the americans say : cut your losses . 
  keep the change ... 
  they arrested someone now apparently . . mon francais est terrible ... 
  so someone should correct me if needed ...

  apparently it happened around [ saint-quentin-fallavier ] ( https://www.google.com/maps?ll=45.639206,5.112762&amp;z=8&amp;t=m&amp;hl=nl-nl&amp;gl=nl&amp;mapclient=embed&amp;q=saint-quentin-fallavier+frankrijk ) , near lyon . 
  dutch media [ reports ] ( http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/06/26/man-onthoofd-bij-fabriek-grenoble-vlag-is-gevonden/ ) a is flag has been found, 
  oooooooooooooooooooooh now i get this one . 
  it did n't make any sense to me, 
   the video has received national attention in the netherlands and i 'm just sitting here , wondering , when was that ? 
  people tend to stand right but they will frequently stand next to each other in stead of behind each other . 
  in nl the government started to inform the public about the ` walk left , stand right ' doctrine for escalators . 
  even after months of infomercials some people still simply do not understand . 
  i am 1,85 so i just kind off walk through these people while saying sorry at the same time . 
  but if your 1,60 like my friend it is utterly annoying . 
   yes greeks voted for those governments . 
  they didnt vote them cause they knew those were corrupt politicians though . 
  not the rest of europe 's fault either . . 
   literally most dutch do n't like these video 's i have no opinion of the cartoons . 
  but people must be able to draw them . 
  it is the core of values that we base our society on . 
  no religion is exempt from this . 
  in this case , and this case only , i 100 % agree with wilders . 
  yes , i understand that . 
  i just do n't agree that denial of men being victims of rape / domestic abuse is so prevalent that opening one centre is such a huge deal . 
  it seems like i 'm out of touch with the reddit opinion on this one . 
  i do n't think the problem is that big and i also do n't believe people keep denying it . 
   because until now the general view was that men could not be victims and only perpetrators . 
  might be huge for sweden , i do n't know , does n't seem that big of a deal . 
  it 's not like no one knows men can be raped / victims of domestic violence . 
   this is a huge step . 
  why ? 
  that why all the dutch use xtc , 
  when did that ( last ) happen ? 
   sure . 
  but every time , in every country - the taxpayers pay for the banks f *** ups . 
  dijsselbloem changed that . 
  share - and bondholder now bleed before any government does when a bank in the eurozone fails . 
  remember that he said the cypriotic case would be a ` blueprint ' for the rest of us and the entire financial world ( and their subsidiaries such as ft and some politicians ) started crying and labeling dijsselbloem ` incompetent ' . 
  [ link 1 ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/2013/03/26/the-ftreuters-dijsselbloem-interview-transcript/ ) [ link 2 ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/dijsselbloem-cyprus-deal-is-a-template-2013-3?ir=t ) . 
  what i am trying to say : you want to change this : be prepared to be fucking lynched by everyone working in , depending on or coming from the financial sector . 
  that 's why this shit does n't change . 
   ftfy !, 
  fuck war . 
   but if the context is that that the nsdap are back in power and germany just started attacking us . 
  the % will be much higher . 
  fuck that shit , i 'll moving to canada . 
  it doesn indeed sound orwellian out of context , that 's why i put it here without any . 
  they measure how people feel about a wide range of subjects ( euro , eu , immigration , religion , life in general , other groups in society et cetera ) . 
  you think of something and our government probably wants a statistic on it . 
  based on these searches they advice the goverment on how the general public feels about these things and in what direction it is changing ( if it is ) . 
  when people started selling wei\u00dfbier ( wheat beer ) in the netherlands they thought the germans meant wei\u00df as in white in stead of wei\u00df as in wheat . 
  now we call it `` white beer '' in stead of `` wheat beer '' . 
  or so the legend goes ... 
  we have a government agency called the `` social and cultural planning bureau '' . 
  and now we will have a political / fiscal / banking union anyway . 
  yeay , democracy !, 
  they present a proposal for every problem and then get it passed . 
  none of the smaller countries can object to germany and france standing together . 
  wow , look at those downvotes even though you ate right . 
  there are 18 countries in te eurozone and every fucking time france and germany sinply decide what we do ... 
  it 's pathetic, 
   then how 's that possible ? 
  means they 're raised in a different language than dutch ? 
  not very dutch of them is it ? 
  a lot ( a big lot ) of the moroccan immigrants at least spend their 2nd and 3rd years of their live in marocco so they take in moroccan culture . 
  this is also a very important phase in your life concerning language ... 
  oh i did n't know that . 
   it 's okay , we gave you apartheid . 
  i would 've laughed my ass of if he said `` 12 points go to russia '' only to see ukraine recieve the 12 points . 
  that would 've been fun to watch . 
  still relevant in / r/argentina, 
  this map is 100 % accurate . 
  1974 - never forget . 
   problem solved ? 
  i might accidently vote for germany that way . 
  it is somewhat sad to see how the us plays each european country for the fools we are . 
  does anyone have a link to the source ? 
  20 % seems awefull high ... that would mean at least 2 million adults have a 30 + bmi . 
  i would 've donated them to poland . 
  sends a message worth more than that $ 200 mil . 
   so greece might have a valid claim ? 
  i 'm afraid the new greek government is vastly overestimating the value that other european countries put on greece . 
  we saved greece because we had to prevent the entire bank system from collapsing . 
  with this arrogant approach the new greek government is trying they are overplaying their hand and will probably be sent into default be the rest of europe soon . 
  should send a needed message to the other countries though . 
   and most of the people living here do n't even know we had presence there . 
  same here . 
  we had some troops in iraq too . 
  but it 's the same as afghanistan , the us tells us where they need our political support and in exchange we sent a few 100 troops .
