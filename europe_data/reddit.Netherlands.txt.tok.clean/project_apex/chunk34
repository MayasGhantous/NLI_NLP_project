  the invasion and combat missions are only lead by the us / uk . 
  all other countries are there so the us/uk can pretend is was n't their idea but a humanitarian mission supported by a lot of countries . 
  sweden :') good boy, 
  can we redistribute household debt as well ? 
  no but a lot of women who did n't work or only part-time suddenly started looking for jobs because their spouses job became less secure due to the crisis . 
  this is , in part , responsible for the higher jobless rate . 
  a person who does n't work \u00e1nd does n't want to is n't counted as jobless . 
  a person who does n't work but does want to , is . 
  no , but our house of representatives interprets the constitution ** as they see fit ** , they could deem it unconstitutional . 
   this applies to all member states . 
  we do n't have a constitutional court in nl . 
  could you translate the legend for me ? 
  google translate is n't much help ... and ` paises bajos ' is the netherlands right ? 
  ( sounds like les pays bas in french . . ), 
   this happens all the time - we disgruntledly follow the rules whereas france and germany do n't . 
  this is how we got into the 2009 crisis . 
  france and germany ` agreeing ' that the rules do n't apply to them and then the other countries following . 
   i 'm pretty sure gun politics are most relevant after people get killed with guns . 
  people in nl get killed with guns , too . 
  i suppose the same for gb ? 
  this has nothing to do with swiss gun policy . 
  a honour killing is where a family member , usually a woman or girl , is killed by a relative because she committed a sin . 
  she is then killed to ` wash ' that sin off the family ( name ) . 
  not all muslim family tragedies are honour killings . 
  muslims are people , too , they fight and have ( mental ) problems just like us . 
  vaccination is mandatory in your country ? 
  really ? 
  does n't your constitution have a provision that prohibits the government from ( unvoluntarily ) touching someone body ? 
  we have a few anti-vaccers in nl as well , but the goverment ca n't force them to vaccinate themselves . 
  what happens if you refuse in your country ? 
  do they force it into you ? 
  in nl a union contract ( cao afspraak ) is negotiated between one ( or more ) companies and one ( or more ) unions . 
  it can not break the law and when the parties agree on a contract they can make a request at the secretary social stuff and work to make it mandatory for all companies in that sector . 
  almost all sectors have a mandatory union contract . 
   i do n't really get why you would oppose the shift to federalism , hence my original question . 
  because all countries are more conservative on pretty much all issues than we are in nl . 
  drug policy , abortion , religion , distribution of wealth et cetera ... 
  the eu ca n't offer us something we do n't have . 
  it only offers us steps back . 
  i see absolutely no point in letting the eu do stuff that we can easily do ourselves . 
  we should have the eu to prevent race-to-the-bottoms ( concerning taxes etcetera ) and creating an internal market with a level playing field for all . 
  there is no point in letting the eu do more than that to be honest . 
   aha , but you 're in the netherlands . 
  you guys are light years ahead of belgium in anything it related . 
  neelie kroes was the best thing to happen to belgian internet since , well , internet . 
  well that 's because your government is keeping the internet as a government-owned monopoly by purpose . 
  i do n't see why you 'd need the eu for that , you 'd just need a functioning government in your own country . 
  even romania has high speed internet ( no offense ) . 
  so the eu is absolutely not needed to create this . 
   yes , through a consolidated effort of the northern states , we saved the economy of southern europe . 
  is n't that part of the reason behind an eu ? 
  the eu was meant to help eastern europe . 
  countries who had a oppressive communist dictatorship for more than 50 years . 
  not countries who have had capitalism for decades but simply ca n't manage their own country . 
  in the us states or cities can default without the entire us being at risk of failing . 
  we need this too in the eu . 
  the new greek government is not presenting any plans to reform greece . 
  they know we will save them anyway . 
  let them default and figger out their own shit . 
  it sucks for greece but countries need to manage their own finances . 
  the eu is not some imf , and it should n't be . 
   belgium constantly gets admonished for spending more than we make , and i consider that a good thing . 
  you need an eu to know you ca n't spend more than you have ? 
  i 'm sorry but this is truly pathetic . 
  you 're a country with 11 million citizens , you should n't need a parent telling you how to spend your money . 
   can someone explain to me why ( many ) ~ ~ uk ~ ~ citizens are against the eu ? 
  well because for the past 70 years the eu has gained more and more power . 
  we are slowly but steadily becoming a federal state like the us . 
  since the crisis they also want one fiscal union , one banking union et cetera . 
  in 5 to 10 years something else will happen and everyone will say : ` this needs to be done by the eu as well ' . 
  this mainly happens because national leaders have no clue how to fix the problems . 
  it 's the same like in 2009 : banks fail all over europe . 
  no one knows how to fix banking regulation so they kick it up to the ecb . 
  like the ecb knows how to fucking manage 5000 banks in all the eurozone countries . 
  regulators could n't fix the few they have in their own country . 
  why would the regulators at the ecb be so much better than our own ? 
  it 's a joke to believe creating a banking union will fix our problems . 
  it will only make us less flexible . 
  many people have a feeling ( including me ) that we are on a train destined for a federal eu , and there is nothing we can do to stop it . 
  in nl for example the only parties who oppose a federal eu are the extreme-left socialist party and the extreme-right freedom party ( wilders ) . 
  all mainstream parties agree on expanding the eu , time and agian . 
  even the right-wing who campaigned with ` no more power from national governments to the eu ' later agreed to hand over our banking regulations to the eu . 
  and this happens every time , and has been happening for 60 years . 
  we got to vote on it , once , in 2006 . 
  62 % voted agianst but they continued giving the eu more power anyway . 
  this feeling is the root of all anti-eu sentiment in nl , and probably in the uk too . 
  ** edit : ** to address the specific issues that you write about :  net neutrality laws ( neelie kroes , awesome lady ) in nl we have a ( way more ) stricter version of net neutrality already in place . 
  the eu 's would set us back a lot . 
  [ click ] ( http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/03/13/dutch-net-neutrality-may-be-scrapped-by-european-parliament/ )  keeping our national deficit from skyrocketing ehm , what ? 
  entire southern europe has n't defaulted because northern europe ( including many poor eastern european states ) saved it . 
  i have no clue how you manage to think the eu has been good for maintaining low national deficits . 
   directives on alternative energy generation i have no knowledge of this ? 
  as far as i know countries make their own alternative energy policy . 
  but happy to learn more about it . 
  as a dutch person i have to admit i , sincerely , sincerely , hope they will stay in the eu . 
  if not , the eu will be governed as they have the eurozone : germany and france deciding what they want and shoving it down the smaller countries ' throat . 
  plus , if the uk leaves the largest country that opposes becoming a province in a federal eu will leave . 
  this will speed up the seemingly unstoppable federal-eu train even more . 
  during the euro crisis none of the national governments had an answer . 
  so they decided to throw the decision making up to the eu level ( banking union , ecb buying bonds et cetera ) to pretend this is a sollution rather than an avoidance to the problem .
