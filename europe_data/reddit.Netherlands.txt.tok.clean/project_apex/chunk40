  thank you, 
  i once say a dutch tv show reporting on something the kids do when they finish highschool ( i think ) . 
  basically it was driving in a bus , drinking , and hooking up . 
  looked fun . 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ ^ all ^ ^ ^ ^ suckit, 
  well ... to be honest i do n't care . 
  but looking at the differences between scotland and england i ca n't blame them for trying . 
   ** legal ** gun ownership is low in the netherlands ftfy . 
  i mean . . we all know you can get a gun if you want to ... 
  we had a huge bubble on the housing market . 
  since 2008 prices are dropping and the bubble is deflating . 
  not as bad as in spain but you can clearly see the artificail rise : [ click ] ( http://goudvergelijken.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/huizenmarkt-nederland-2013.png ) . 
  we are very lucky to have a stable job market , else a lot more home evictions would be happening . 
  also , the market is heavily regulated by government . 
  nearly all people with low income live in social housing . 
  there are 2.2 million ( !!! ), 
  social houses in the netherlands . 
  in total there are 6.9 million houses . 
  more than 1 in 4 houses is social . 
  this is mainly because the social housing is n't done by the government but by corporations . 
  these corporations to their job so well that there is actually a waiting list for social houses . 
  not because there are too few . 
  but because the people do n't want to leave . 
  i know a lawyer who lives in a social house for ~ $ 600 a month . 
  the overall quality of the social housing is so good that it has become a disturbance to the private sector . 
   i would imagine everyone has to vote at the age of 18 but i do n't know how it 's handled . 
  nope . 
  turnout is 35 % for euro elections here . 
  the dutch hosts said a small 200 million people watch it across the world . 
  it even seems to be popular in australia !, 
  if i put my towel on the bed next to the pool at 08:00 then that means i reserve it for myself to use at 10:00 . 
   politically left = anarchist , socialist , communist , and the variations of those when people in the netherlands talk about the ` politically left ' they are talking about political parties like the [ socialist party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_party_ ( netherlands ) , [ labour party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/labour_party_ ( netherlands ) , or [ greenleft ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groenlinks ) . 
  there are no more anarchists or communists here . 
  or , if they are , they are not politically significant . 
  in the polls the socialist party is the third biggest now : [ click ] ( https://www.noties.nl/v/get.php?a=peil.nl&amp;f=voorkeur.jpg&amp;cache=0 ), 
  built in 1684 . 
  at least that is what it says on the front . 
  we had this in my city around 5 years ago . 
  the mayor placed a big ad in the newspaper telling everyone they were part of a beggar-gang and that no one should give them money . 
  they left 2 weeks later . 
   why are you americans all jacked up about being attacked and go all ape-shit violent ? 
  why are you talking to him like this ? 
  he was in the military \u00e1nd the police . 
  this guy is a double-hero !, 
  he has sacrificed his entire life so that you and i can livein the democratic warzone we call europe . 
  best comment so far . 
  haha , `` bring a tank ! '', 
  do n't listen to this guy . 
  there is no way someone can live in the netherlands for 24 years and only have 1 bike stolen . 
   pick pocketing and very obvious theft ( like in naples , a vespa driving by and snatching your bag or phone ) . 
  just a question : if someone did this to you in the us would you seriously shoot or stab him ? 
  i mean what kind of situation do you think you will end up in where you having a weapon is positive ?? 
  unless you want to carry an american flag into a crimean government building you really do n't need a weapon . 
  we do n't celebrate labour day here . 
  everyone is off to work or school as they would on any other day . 
  i am dutch and i dissaprove . 
  i have absolutely no logical reason for it . 
  but reali ** z ** ed in stead of realised just gives me an itch . 
  any article/news item/documentary coming from anglosaxon media can be disregarded imo . 
  the economist has declared france dead , like , 5 times now since the crisis started . 
  same for others and the press bureau 's like reuters and ap . 
  well i could tell you about life in the netherlands but there is only one thing to say : we are human too . 
  and by that i mean that it probably wo n't be much difference weither you are born in canada or in the netherlands . 
  i think people in the netherlands are more ` work to live ' than ` live to work ' . 
  we have very good opportunities to work part-time . 
  it 's mostly used by women but the share of men that work part-time is growing . 
  the # 1 sport here ( just like in the whole world , except north-america and a few others ) is football . 
  many people play it and even more watch it on the tv . 
  we also have a , sort of , national motto that is ` doe maar normaal , dan doe je al gek genoeg ' . 
  this means : ` just act normal , that 's crazy enough ' . 
  this pretty much means that there is no reason for anyone to show off with money , status or anything exceptional . 
  it 's seperated . 
  all borders are open and you can work or live anywhere you 'd like but that 's not happening on a scale like in the us . 
  besides languages every country has its own culture and society . 
  even in countries like the netherlands and flanders ( belgium ) people are more or less seperated from each other by cultural borders . 
  we watch our own tv channels , read own newspapers and visit websites from their own country and mind our own stuff . 
  when something happens in belgium people will hear about it from the dutch tv news in stead of watching the belgian one ( which is ( by law ) broadcasted to everyone . 
  same goes for german , french and italian tv channels . 
  this is not a complaint but an illustration that europe may seem ` one ' to an outsider , because we have a european parliament , the euro , a flag etc. . . 
  but for most aspects of life we are still independent societies . 
  so to answer your question ` what 's it like living in europe ' : no one lives in europe . 
  you can live in belgium , england , spain , latvia or greece . 
  they are all part of europe but , firstly , independent nations who are different from each other in many ways . 
  my computer came in dutch when i bought it . 
  my first action was to switch it to english . 
  not because i ca n't read dutch but it is just much easier when using online guides and manuels for software since there are more of them in english . 
  the computers at my work are usually in dutch while the ones on the university are in english ( but that 's because of the ~ 20 % foreigners that attend it ) . 
  most of my friends and family just use the dutch ui but that 's because it was sold that way or they do n't know you can change it . 
  i 'd say pretty sociably accepted . 
  obviously you can buy weed/hasj/psycho truffles ( legally ) here . 
  but next to that there is a rising social acceptance of the use of recreational hard drugs . 
  it might be because of my increasing age but the feeling i get is that the use of , especially , mdma/xtc is more widespread than before . 
  you do n't get punished ( hard ) for posession or use of the drugs . 
  if private security catches you they ask you : ` do you distance yourself from it ' . 
  if you say yes and hand over the drugs you 're ok . that said : many people are ( still ) , after 44 years of legal canabis/shrooms sale , advocating to legalise the production . 
  just check out the [ google results ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=dutch+mayors+weed&amp;oq=dutch+mayors+weed&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3558j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=utf-8 ) . 
  but we have a secretary that is about 120 years old and from a conservative party and he wo n't give in . 
  we will eventually fully legalise the production and sale of weed/shrooms/truffles and to be honest i think we will see the same kind of ( political ) acceptance for the sale of xtc somewhere in the coming decades . 
  it depends on the politcal party but most will , when asked , publically state that it is your right to experiment with drugs if you want . 
  greece,
