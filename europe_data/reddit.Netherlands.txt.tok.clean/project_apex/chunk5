  if the uk leaves there is nothing to stop a federal eu . 
  we 'll be in a new country within 10 years . 
  first we `` really need '' a banking union , then a fiscal union , and over the years we `` must '' give up more and more national soevereignity to the eu to save ourselves ... 
  watching european media discuss the necessity of a federal eu is like watching the us media discuss the necessity of going to war ( agian ) ... 
  i was inclined to answer flanders because it is basically more like my home ( i live in dutch limburg ) than holland ever could be . 
  but i am answering : france . 
  why ? 
  because as long a i can remember we have gone to france for holiday . 
  campings in the mountains du vosges du jura or near nancy . 
  apparments at the mediterrenian in marseille , nice or montpellier . 
  or eurodisney at paris . 
  always had the most fun in france . 
  i especially love how you can just drive and see where the payage and rn will take you . 
  they have campings everywhere !, 
  check . 
  mate . 
   the british government is not pleased pretty sure the huge , public and solo campaign agianst juncker plus your constant treathening to leave the eu if you do n't get your way has n't helped your diplomats during the negotiations . 
  yeah what is up with estonia and it ? 
  i heard the it sector is booming there . 
  nato put its cyber defense command ( one of them ? ), 
  there and even the government has succesfull it projects . 
   i 'm sure this could be killed with a successful court challenge .

  this is by far the weirdest but also by far the best : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnpvwvcdinu, 
  bbc radio 1 : essential mix with pete thong . 
  every saturday between 2am and 4am ( cest ) . 
  fluent dutch , english and limburgs ( dialect ) . 
  i can read ans make myself understandable in german and i can read french . 
  and as a result of the above i can also read danish ( i can understand what its about ) , afrikaans and a bit of luxembourghs . 
  west . 
   sorry , you are in the weapons sharing thing . 
  not officialy though . 
  it has come to the point were three prime ministers ( including our current ) have admitted we have nukes on some millitary base but the government wo n't ` officially ' ackknowledge it . 
  cause , you know , we give iran & co. shit for not letting in inspectors while having nukes but no inspectors ourselves ... 
  pfft . 
  ( but not officially . 
  - pm mark rutte ), 
  so the netherlands is in the clear ? 
  i regularely catch myself trying to remember the dutch version of an english word ... 
  england : empire from cradle to grave . 
  i 'm all for working together . 
  but i just think it 's too big to have a efficient government . 
  there are no european ( labour ) unions : each country has national unions . 
  there is no european media to check the government : each country has its own national media to check the national government . 
  a democracy * needs * a media that checks the government . 
  a democracy * needs * people to care about politics . 
  no one in the eu ( except for the people here maybe ) actually care for the eu . 
  they only care for the part that affects them . 
  in the last election for the parliament ( that can not make laws and where you can only vote for people from your own country ) only ** 36 % ** came to vote in my country . 
  we need to have an eu based on cooperation . 
  not on passing on soevereignity to the eu . 
  it has no democratic basis , not being checked by media and it is too far away from the people . 
  the financial sector is a fine example of this . 
  since the banks started to fail in 2007 pretty much all politicians have started to panick . 
  no one knew what the fuck to do about the banks . 
  so they bailed them out . 
  gave them money without making the banks of the shareholders pay . 
  because the bankers said that was what needed to be done . 
  and now , 5 years later : all of the politicians still have * no fucking clue * about what to do with the banks . 
  so they simply hand over the authority to the ecb / eu and create a banking union . 
  but here is the kicker : ** the eu is run by the same politicians that ran national governments 5 years ago ** . 
  and they still have no clue about what to do with the banks . 
  national governments could n't keep their banks in line so now they expect the eu to do it for * all banks in the eu * . 
  it makes no sense . 
  ** and this is what happens every time : ** when politicians do n't have the answer to problems they simply point to the eu . 
  and this goes both ways : politicians who do n't want to propose ( necessary ) reforms point to the ecb to print money . 
  and politicians who do n't know how to solve problems kick the problems ( deficit , banking union , euro ) up to the eu level . 
  and this kind of playing with soevereignity does not create good policy or good vision . 
  well you would n't be the first nation to consider joining its big neighbour . 
  from time to time dutch media and people bring up the idea of [ joining ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2844/archief/archief/article/detail/3038147/2011/11/17/laten-we-ons-bij-duitsland-aansluiten.dhtml ) [ germany ] ( http://www.mt.nl/1/75443/home/nederland-beter-af-als-duitse-provincie.html ) since we are pretty much a german bundesstaat in terms of economy . 
   please help if we start to get invaded . 
   tolerance has been thrown out of the window a long time ago . 
  tolerance = / = let everyone in that lives in a poorer country than us . 
  we have recently agreed to increase spending agian following incidents in ukraine ... 
   not reporting illegals is basically the equivalent of slapping those in the face who follow the rules . 
  signed adolf eichmann - 1942 . 
   ___ but in all seriousness : these people come from warzones and the poorest countries on earth and try to start over . 
  i fully understand that we ca n't help them all or take them all in , but reporting individuals who come here seems a bit harsh to me . 
  if they are illegal than the state should do their best to arrest and deport them . 
  but personally i would n't report someone who i know has gone through hell ( did you see the boats they use to cross the mediterranean ? ), 
  just so he could try and get a better life for himself . 
   what good times are you referencing that they were n't doing this ? 
  the past 20 years before the crisis ? 
   usa managed to rebound quicker from recession than europe and they did it with the help of spending . 
  your wall street is high but that does n't mean mainstreat has recovered . 
  the qe is hiding a lot of the pain going on on main street . 
   right now the pension deficit is payed for by debts , not taxes . 
  those debts have to be payed for some time . 
  ( i think thats why france wants the ecb to print money , huh ? ), 
   it 's not like we have a shortage of workers . 
  you have a shortage of workers who have a job . 
  ( and pay taxes ) . 
  every man working helps the economy . 
  lol , i just found out that charleroi is a city and not just an airport . 
  til . 
  [ click ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bab75uznt8o ), 
   how would that affect growth ? 
  france does n't save for its pension , instead the pensions of pensioners now are payed for by taxing the people who are working now . 
  low pension age = more people that need pension + less people to pay those pensions = higher taxes .
