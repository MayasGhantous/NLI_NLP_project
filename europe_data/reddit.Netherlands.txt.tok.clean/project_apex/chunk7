  i hope he does n't change the doctrine of letting shareholders bleed when their own banks fail ... before dijsselbloem profits were privitasid while all losses were socialised ... fuck that . 
  i understand that the greek people are the ones fucked hardest by your politicians ... no one got to vote on anything in the eu . 
  that is the root fucking cause of all the discontent ... 
   and probably you also do n't know to what countries nl lended money but just a generic `` south '' . 
  greece : 3,2 billion in 2010 , 14,6 billion in 2011 ( via efsf ) spain : 41,4 billion to spanish banks in 2012 ( 2,6 billion of that is dutch ) . 
  portugal : 78 billion in 2011 ( 4,8 billion of that it dutch ) ireland : 40,2 billion in 2010 . 
  ( 2,5 billion is dutch ) . 
  and that is just the lending . 
  i 'm not even counting the * 201 billion * euros in guarantees that we had to give . 
  so , congrats , italy is not on the list !, 
  and it would n't even be considered for the list if you had n't voted for berlusconi * three times in a row * . 
  but hey , this is just what my media is telling me . 
  what 's yours saying ? 
  that italy is fantastic and that it is all the fault of the eu/imf ? 
  yeah polls in nl always show that 60 % or 70 % is in favour of staying in the euro * now * . 
  but when asked if we should 've even joined the euro most people say no . 
  leaving is so costly that we are kind of trapped ... 
   and now they all want to keep it . 
  it is more that getting out is impossible / very expensive rather than actually wanting the euro . 
  im pretty sure that if we could get out without consequences / costs we would ...  it 's just not such an important issue for everyone , even if they tend to be against it . 
  sensing a big difference between nl and de here i think . 
  people here are pretty pissed that we now have to pay/lend billions to other eurozone countries . 
  plus , we are now forced to give up more sovereignty to the eu and ecb . 
  plus , in nl people voted ** 61 % agianst ** the proposed eu constitution and today we are rolled , without a popular vote or even a decent debate , into a banking and fiscal union . 
  so , yeah , people are not happy with the eu or the euro . 
  i 'd stay out of it if i were you because the entire south has to still reform and france is still denying it has to so they are probably going to need a bail out in 5 years or so . 
  we have excellent cycle paths . 
  you can reach the other side of the city by bike and only have to cross a ( car ) road twice or so . 
  so as long as my parents know were i went and home before dark it was usually okay to go where i wanted in and around the city . 
  in the netherlands ` u ' is the polite/formal form of jij . 
  in flanders however people usually say ` u ' to everyone . 
  in the netherlands you only do this to older people or people ` above ' you ( student - teacher , employee - boss et cetera ) . 
   if your income is below a certain level you also get subsidized coverage ( not totally sure of the arrangements here ) . 
  you basically get health insurance for free . 
  im a student and pay $ 83 a month to my insurer but i get ` paid ' $ 79 or so per month from the government . 
  its called ` zorgtoeslag ' . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_401_en.pdf ) is the full report by the way , for those interested . 
  what i find most interesting is this :  opinions about cannabis are more divided : 53 % think it should continue to be banned , while 45 % think it should be regulated . 
  and one page furthur they show [ this graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fodzpxq.png ) . 
  it clearly shows that there is no relation whatsoever between legalising cannabis and the use thereof . 
  yet , mysteriously , the eu fails to draw this conclusion and simply skips to the next part of the report ... edit : okay , i 'm seriously starting to doubt the credibility of this report . 
  how does ** 28 % ** of dutch respondents say it is ` difficult ' to obtain cannabis within 24 hours ? 
  ** 14 % ** even says it is ` impossible ' . 
  [ source ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j4di33b.png ) the only way it is impossible for a dutch person to be unable to obtain weed within 24 hours is if he or she is not 18 yet . 
  else you can simply walk into a coffeeshop ... 
   the legislation , which will need the approval of meps and governments , seeks to cut the time needed to ban a substance under current procedures from two years to 10 months . 
  so in stead of changing 1 % of the substance every 2 years it will now happen every 10 months ... like this will solve anything . . 
   why do you have belgian flair when youre obviously from north america ? 
  you should get your head out of this / r/europe circlejerk because i 'm pretty sure 80 % of the people could n't name 5 names in the eu parliament . 
  it 's a phantom parliament , designed to justify the eu . 
  ' [ nsb ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_movement_in_the_netherlands ) ' is still used as a synonym for traitor today . 
  i 'd let them in just to stick it to putin . 
  they declared their own state . 
  they could just hold the money in a few central places and give out is-bonds or so . 
  much like the us used to hold gold in one place and gave out dollars that represented a portion of gold . 
  that way you dont need to move the money physically but can still use it . 
  besides , they earn millions with oil , smuggling , ransom and capturing banks like the one in mosul . 
  being your own police is profitable, 
   it has a logical reason . 
  i too look twice when i see someone with her face covered . 
  it seems really weird to want that and not being able to see someone 's face is weird when talking to them . 
  but still i do n't think the government should n't ban them . 
  i 'm sure iran has very logical reasons to force people to cover their hair . 
  well , logical from their point of view of course . 
  i think european countries ( like my own ) trying to force women to take it off just as bad as sa or iran forcing women to put it on ... just let them choose . 
  i know it 's hard to understand from a european perspective that any woman would ever choose to wear this , but that does n't mean they are all forced to . 
  it all bs anyway . 
  we all call saudi-arabia and iran medieval for forcing women to wear headscarfs . 
  and now we force women to * not * wear something . 
  seems the same to me . 
  yeah it does n't add up . 
  according to our own statistics bureau there were [ 2,2 million ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/menu/themas/bouwen-wonen/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2012/2012-3652-wm.htm?languageswitch=on ) social housing houses in the netherlands in 2012 . 
  2,2 million on a population of 17 million seems larger than what the graph says . 
  also , the mortgages are so frequent in the netherlands because our mortgage deductions laws were so that it was cheaper to pay the rent on the mortgage and not pay off the mortgage to keep your tax deduction as high as possible . 
  they are more or less leasing their home ... 
  this has now been changed so the number of people with mortgages is expected to shrink a lot in the coming years . 
  that 's ok . you are correct . 
  the u.s. is a beacon of light in our world that only does good . 
  and the others show that they join isis when it suits them .

   i wonder where that road will lead us : / there are no roads in geopolitics , only destinations . 
  i did n't mean it as an insult , i just meant that on some subjects they are closer to america than to the rest of europe . 
  if it matter that much to you we could just say that america went britain ? 
  it seems a bit drastic for copyright infringement , that 's all i was implying . 
  think about the manpower that it costs to maintain that warning system ... 
  no not completely but they are increasingly going `` american '' . 
  stuff like higher college tuition , less social housing , less benefits , less housing benefits and stuff . 
   a list of ip addresses that provide copyrighted material . 
  and how do you think that list comes to be ? 
   propaganda also works wonders oh that is even happening here . 
  our `` news '' today mainly consists of copied / translated reports from ap , reuters and other press agencies . 
  when they announced that the us was bombing is everyone was very positive and asked why europe did n't do it . 
  the public statements from cameron and obama about supplying weapons and training to the isis are quickly forgotten ... 
  the weapons that russia supplied to ukraine are pure evil though . 
  yes but i 'm pretty sure my isp does n't use deep packet inspection to check if what i 'm sending is copyright material ... 
  i think we all have to come to the conclusion that russia was right when they said to support assad in stead of the rebels that now form is . 
  imagine what syria would look like now if russia , iran and hezbollah had n't helped assed to beat is down . 
  is would now be bordering israel ... 
  funny how that goes in geopolitics . 
  cheering for the `` axis of evil '' and hoping that `` the land of the free '' stops delivering weapons to rebels ...
