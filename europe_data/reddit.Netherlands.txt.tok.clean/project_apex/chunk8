  your isp tracks what kind of packages you send over the net ? 
   you get 3 warnings for downloading copyrighted content but thats all , its just warnings . 
  they track everyone 's data for the sake of copyright ? 
  but what 's the point ? 
  that would be the same as saying `` i 'm from africa '' or '' i 'm form the americas '' . 
  you still do n't know where he is from because there is enourmous difference between nations and cultures that are african or american . 
  they are allready in now with the uk . 
  if scotland would leave the uk then france and germany would be more than welcome to fast-track you in to stick it to cameron and his yes-no-yes-no eu-referendum .

  why are people in de middle-east more negative about russia ? 
  is n't russia the one that supplied syria and iraq with weapons to beat back is ? 
  and all it takes is a complete dismantling of social services and benefits . 
  they tried the same with tpb in the netherlands . 
  number of visitors actually went up due to huge exposure for the site in the news and the widely available proxies . 
  now its open agian . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  on my wishlist !, 
  hear amazing things about it . 
  i understand that i 'm in the rich part of europe . 
  but i have family in italy so i know a bit what 's its like there . 
  and to be honest : the people in italy and spain are still better off than before the euro . 
  if italy still had the lire it would simply devaluate the currency to become more competetive . 
  it has done so for years . 
  and for years that option was so easy that no one ever proposed to fix the government and the labour market in stead of printing money and raising gasoline taxes . 
  what 's the matter is that the ecb does n't infinitely print money like the fed and the boe to hide the problems in the real economy . 
  in stead we are reforming our labour markets , pensions , et cetera and that * fucking * hurts and it takes years . 
  but in the end we will have reformed our labour markets ( like germany begin 2001 or so ) and we will come out more competitive as a result . 
  it does hurt a lot now , especially in the mediterean countries , but it has to be done . 
  at the moment the fed is pumping so much money that wall st is at an all-time high ( even higher than 2007 peak ) . 
  in the meantime the real us economy ( mainstreet ) is barely starting to recover . 
  and as if that is n't enough the nsa just dealt a huge fucking blow to the only thing the u.s. is the absolute champion at : it . 
  lot 's of companies are moving their data to the eu , switzerland et cetera . 
  china and russia already stated to move away from us made soft - and hardware and europe is drafting laws that will strengthen its digital security . 
  anyway , i do n't see any solution in printing money because * the very first * thing that politicians will do when the ecb starts covering their debt is spend more to gain political capital . 
  because if they do n't , their opponent will . 
  and we ca n't have that because we 'll be back in the same shit by 2020 . 
  yeah , same here . 
  the benelux customs union was initiated in 1947 or so and the free travel for people followed in 1960 . 
  then in the 80s france and germany joined in and now we are ( almost ? ), 
  over 30 countries !, 
  yes , but i 'm just arguing the people who say `` without the eu the borders would n't be open '' . 
  that is just [ not true ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_agreement ) , it can easily be done ( and was done ) in a seperate treaty . 
  not saying that the eu is a bad thing . 
  just that it is not a result of the eu / federalism . 
  i do n't think athens - budapest - petersburg is 50km ... 
  there is a typo in netherlands . 
  ot : i like these series . 
  they show stuff of other countries that you normally do n't see unless you go there . 
  why stop in both aachen and liege when you could only stop once in the middle !, 
  maastricht would be a good option for a small stop . 
  else everyone in the netherlands has to go to the randstad or brussels . 
  given maastrichts ' good train connection to eindhoven , liege and aachen combined with its european institutions would make it a perfect stop for a hs train . 
  source : i 'm from maastricht . 
   that happens anyway because the uk is not in schengen . 
  if you keep repeating that ` eu = open borders ' then eventually people will start to believe it . 
  it is too big . 
  if i see the united states . 
  how little the congress cares for the normal people , a fed that is blind to all but wall st , the main lobbyist for the isp 's becoming the head of fcc . 
  in the netherlands , when a politician or the government does something that the majority does n't like he is forced with soft power to change it . 
  this ` soft ' power is media , the internet , unions , important people/organisations . 
  and of course the ` hard ' power is voting someone out . 
  but there is no european media that checks the eu commission . 
  there are no european unions ( labour unions ) that speak for * all * europeans . 
  everyone in europe fights for his own . 
  so in conclusion : * too far away from the people they suppose to represent . 
  * everyone will fight for his own interests . 
  * there is no european media that checks the eu . 
  all media check the part that affects the country they are from . 
  ( media = crucial for a democracy ) * no one feels ` european ' . 
  and that is not a bad thing . 
  we are not one culture , and we should n't pretend to be . 
  * no more benchmarking between countries . 
  ( here in nl we * always * compare ourselves to how germany is doing and then adjust our actions . 
  keeps everyone sharp . ), 
  * a federal eu would be a heaven for lobbyists . 
  just like in the us you now need to lobby only one government to affect 500 million people . 
  we must n't want that . 
  co\u00f6peration ? 
  ** yes !!! ** . 
  one country / federal eu ? 
  no thank you . 
  the fact that they support assad while the us/uk gave weapons to the opposition that now calls itself isis is something i would call positivw, 
  anyone who uses torrents must have noticed that romania 's internet speeds are out of line with the others in [ europe ] ( http://imgur.com/ul2jmgd ) .
