o yeah they still [ do that ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/08/11/uk-spain-gibraltar-idukbre9780kq20130811 ) . 
  did you even read anything past the article heading ? 
   yatsenyuk , who made his comments during a cabinet meeting , said the government would continue to supply gas and electricity to the area . 
  with current de-facto government that controls these areas sending state funds to the region would be like madrid sending money to gibraltar . 
  safer too , heh, 
  yeah . 
  fuck you , north sea , this clay is ours .

  [ rotterdam central station ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xadf0uuodny/uxzlrcscrci/aaaaaaaauyi/b1o8h6nozoe/s1600/img_4854.jpg ) . 
  shaped like the traditional rotterdam kebab , [ kapsalon ] ( http://aldiedingen.com/september/afbeeldingen/september/kapsalon2.jpg ), 
  us has like what , 2 parties ? 
  meanwhile there is nothing even remotely close to popular opposition movement in russia . 
  the mass protests in 2011 were about as massive as the 10k people who marched in hungary over the internet tax , if you just do the head count relative to local population . 
  every consecutive attempt to run anything like it pretty much failed due to lack of interest . 
  putin has no reason to stifle any opposition parties , they are doing fine discrediting themselves with all sorts of shenanigans . 
   why does n't he just let everyone compete like whom ? 
   there are a lot of things we never hear about . 
  sure , why not . 
  but what i meant was that degree of western-model liberalism is often used as a yardstick for judging how * democratic * a country is . 
  which is nonsense . 
   the people who are in charge seem to know what they are doing , but what happens when that changes ? 
  in russia the level of life had been rising throughout putin 's reign . 
  who 's to say he does n't know what he is doing ? 
  i 'm not a fan of the guy , his policies or this whole * russia rising from it 's knees * bullshit , but objectively russia is doing well . 
  unemployment is low , health care and education are free , something that many more `` democratic '' countries do n't often enjoy . 
  this argument that you just made is the exact same one that putin 's supporters are making . 
  so how would you actually convince them they are wrong ? 
  by the time [ russian t-50s ] ( http://www.defenceaviation.com/2014/01/indian-air-force-not-happy-with-sukhoi-t-50pak-fafgfa.html ) are lurking over the horizon we will all be riding hover boards . 
  russia is still very much a democracy . 
  the fact that it is not liberal does not change the fact that putin enjoys massive support and that most people would vote him in over and over again . 
  meanwhile the [ democrats in egypt ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/poll-shows-egyptians-favour-democracy-and-stoning-for-adultery/article564671/ ) want to start stoning people for adultery . 
  and they enjoy massive support too . 
  at the same time in singapore they run a real [ authoritarian state ] ( http://storage.globalcitizen.net/data/topic/knowledge/uploads/2013061985831150917_election%20strategy%20and%20ethnic%20politics%20in%20singapore.pdf ) yet you seldom hear about it . 
  because people still had dark room equipment back then and developing color photos at home is a bitch . 
  we should just go back to [ krampus ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lpsbcrx.jpg ) and be done with it . 
  [ fiets opa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqjjg0x7raq ) ( in english ), 
  * exaggerated, 
  aldi beer is awesome . 
  now i ` ma let you finish , but [ putin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv4ijhz2yio ) had the best number ... 
  nah , it 's still fun . 
  i used to work at europe container terminals ( ect ) , keeping track of containers being loaded and operating agv 's . 
  nowadays it 's actually all automated , the whole on-site staff was maybe a few dozen guys , loading thousands of containers each day . 
  these massive ships that come in are awesome , moving tonnes of cargo around at a push of a button is pretty neat and the views at night are great . 
  the only drag was waking up at 4 am . 
  i did n't think it was that expensive . 
  went there to check it out the other day , picked up some veggies and nuts and stuff . 
  it 's like albert heijn prices . 
  ca n't say there were any dramatic gypsy movements around here ... 
  i was in brussels last summer though . 
  saw a gypsy woman there , begging on the pavement , with an infant in her arms , like wtf . 
  it 's less hassle to have just one passport , double nationalities in the netherlands are frowned upon . 
  many russians abroad hold on to their nationality so they can travel there without a visa and opt for permanent residence permits instead . 
  i was eligible for a dutch passport for years by now , but my status allowed me all the benefits of regular citizenship , so i just did n't see a point . 
  nowadays though who knows what the fuck is going to happen . 
  maybe i go to russia as a national next time and they send me to the army . 
  if i ever go there again , i 'd rather go as dutch . 
  plus the field in which i study and work can be security sensitive , and with all the bellicose rhetoric russia might end up on the no-hire shit list along with iran or pakistan . 
  maybe a few years ago i would feel sad about doing this , but now i 'm just happy i do n't have to live there . 
  we 're [ getting there ... ] ( http://vimeo.com/74044572 ), 
  the thought of some guy using a quantum computer to decrypt jlaw nudes kinda cracks me up . 
  i just got a dutch passport a couple of months ago , going to turn in my russian one . 
  was holding onto it for sentimental reasons i guess . 
  but now it 's just like ... fuck it . 
  there 's plenty of wind in nl . 
  there are projects currently underway to build [ massive wind power plants ] ( http://geminiwindpark.nl/ ) on the north sea . 
  they even plan to export energy to germany since they are closing down their nuclear power plants . 
  i wonder what they do with them in the netherlands . 
  like you go to berlin , gypsies everywhere . 
  brussels , same thing . 
  then you go to amsterdam and it 's just the occasional local junkies .

  swiss are super chill .

  [ holland is godverdomme het hardste ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqrlpupbj-k ), 
  for what , leaving gaza to hamas ? 
  jesus , 2000 was [ quite a year ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3unfhj66goo ) , huh ... 
  this whole balaclava thing is really catching on these days , huh ... 
  did n't they lose that airport like a week ago ? 
  you people ? 
  i live in barcelona now , hah . 
  from what i 've gathered the more educated general idea is * yeah , we send all that money to madrid and we do n't get anything in return * . 
  the less educated one is * fuck spain , these fascist bastards * . 
  now regarding the former i 'm sure there is some data that catalunya has higher tax burdens and such . 
  but did you consider that if you were n't part of spain then madrid might as well take its business elsewhere ? 
  i 'm not sure if that 's going to play out well . 
  and regarding the latter , franco is dead , people , get over it . 
  the difference is that dutch parliamentarians actually go to work , not just come in the morning to stamp themselves in and then fuck off back to their hotel for the rest of the day . 
  the lack of democracy argument comes from the lack of oversight over what the european comission is up to . 
  these guys are appointed , not elected .
