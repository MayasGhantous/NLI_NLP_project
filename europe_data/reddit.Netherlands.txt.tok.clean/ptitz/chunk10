  well , i got my own views on the way the world should work and they are a bit more radical than that . 
  but given the current system , no , i do n't think that eu is bad . 
  my point is that there are issues with the way eu operates . 
  and many of these issues could have been avoided if some healthy skepticism was applied when making the policies that had led to current eu crisis . 
  therefore i think it is important that there are parties like pvv or ukip to keep the public aware of these issues and to keep the eu in check . 
  what i do n't like is that they have to appeal to xenophobes and racists to gain support , while it 's just common sense . 
  and now that it is becoming more clear , these parties are gaining weight , at the expense of other parties that are plagued by excessive euro-enthusiasm . 
   just like the hague bureaucrats . 
  yeah , i think that the less bureaucracy the better in general  eu regulations and directives are n't decided by `` brussels bureaucrats '' but by the european council and parliament , that is , our elected governments and meps . 
  i do n't remember voting for merkel . 
  or against her for that matter . 
  and yet there she is , sitting in the council . 
  but besides that , actually there is a smoky room in brussels filled with bureaucrats . 
  its called the european commission . 
  and they are the ones currently in charge of eu ets , among other things . 
  like deciding minimum banana sizes or banning oil jugs . 
  well , in for a penny , in for a pound . 
  but the first issue here is that brussels bureaucrats are not exactly elected , they are appointed . 
  and yet they are the ones making the decisions about the * common european goals * . 
  the second issue is that these are not excessive regulations quote unquote , they do cause real harm to some countries . 
  take carbon tax for example . 
  sure the netherlands can afford to battle global warming and so on , but whats the point of imposing it on greece ? 
  it just hurts tourism there , makes the plane tickets more expensive . 
  from [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2fychlouxy ) , at 7:42 . 
  probably true . 
  naw , ethernet is not going anywhere . 
  at least in enterprise applications . 
  it 's still faster than wifi , you know . 
  you need to invest quite a bit to bring up your wifi network on par with ethernet . 
  but yeah , in the end you still have to find a hole in a wall if you want to work somewhere , even if you got wifi already . 
  and with most devices you also have to drag a big pile of chargers around . 
  why not just make it part of infrastructure ? 
  does n't have to be ethernet , thats just an example , since you got these things everywhere . 
  but for example some modern power sockets already have a [ usb socket built in ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/double-socket-usb-outlets/dp/b00b9g6yo0%3fsubscriptionid%3dakiailshyytfivpwuy6q%26tag%3dduc08-21%26linkcode%3dxm2%26camp%3d2025%26creative%3d165953%26creativeasin%3db00b9g6yo0 ) . 
  thats pretty neat . 
  i dunno , i just checked mine , its 16.5 . 
  it does n't matter that much really . 
  his bad points is what gets him his votes . 
  but in the end pvv is the only euroskeptical platform speaking out against excessive regulations passed down from brussels . 
  and they are the only ones actually talking about issues with multiculturalism . 
  and there are issues . 
  i know , i 'm a filthy foreigner myself . 
  and if the guy needs bodyguards just because of speaking his mind he ca n't be all that wrong in my opinion . 
  standardized 16.5 v power + ethernet sockets would be pretty kickass ... 
  i do n't know , i would have a beer with him ... 
  he has some valid points besides the whole * dem took our jerbs * thing . 
  well , they were pretty effective in the vietnam war ... 
  he does that like every other week . 
  any house-hunting tips for spain ? 
  i 'm going to be looking for a place in barcelona starting this summer , hows the situation there ? 
  i think there needs to be a reliable scale . 
  like from hitler to pope francis . 
   which policies , exactly ? 
  giving billions in stimulus money and government positions to his [ top campaign contributors ] ( http://www.publicintegrity.org/2011/06/15/4880/obama-rewards-big-bundlers-jobs-commissions-stimulus-money-government-contracts-and ) for a start . 
   the usa has the highest/one of the three highest projected gdp growth rates among oecd countries usa also has one of the highest [ income inequality scores ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/soc_glance-2011-en/06/01/g6_eq1-01.html?contenttype=&amp;itemid=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2fsoc_glance-2011-16-en&amp;mimetype=text%2fhtml&amp;containeritemid=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f19991290&amp;accessitemids=%2fcontent%2fbook%2fsoc_glance-2011-en ) and [ poverty rates ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/soc_glance-2011-en/06/02/g6_eq2-01.html?contenttype=&amp;itemid=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2fsoc_glance-2011-17-en&amp;mimetype=text%2fhtml&amp;containeritemid=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f19991290&amp;accessitemids=%2fcontent%2fbook%2fsoc_glance-2011-en ) among oecd countries . 
  it has more inequality and higher unemployment than russia does . 
   russia , syria , egypt , and perhaps israel wait , and the little war in lybia never happened or what ? 
  [ god knows how many civilians dead ] ( http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/libya0512webwcover_0.pdf ) in nato strikes . 
  a secular country turned over to [ islamists ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/19/libya-islamists-gaining-strength-libyans-concerned-by-sectarian-violence_n_2909693.html ) . 
  thanks , obama !, 
  and [ spying on longtime us allies ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/24/merkel-nsa-spying_n_4156846.html ) ? 
  appointing [ fucking idiots ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/security-watch/backchannels/2014/0206/amid-us-russia-tussle-over-ukraine-a-leaked-tape-of-victoria-nuland ) to sensitive diplomatic positions ? 
  you must 've missed all that . 
  i mean hell , at least putin does n't [ keep al quaeda on his payroll ] ( http://www.frontpagemag.com/2013/arnold-ahlert/obamas-move-to-arm-al-qaeda-in-syria/ ) . 
  no wonder al quaeda controls [ more territory than ever ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/07/opinion/bergen-al-qaeda-terrority-gains/index.html ) . 
  obama regime probably claims a higher death toll in a year than putin during his entire career in kremlin . 
  and yet obama is the one winning nobel peace prizes while putin is censured as a blood-thirsty warmonger . 
   absolute nonsense . 
  bush would have never put forward the affordable care act and how did that work out ? 
  health care in us is still a big fucking money drain just the way it was before . 
  health care is free in putins russia by the way . 
  and even if you go to a private practitioner in russia ( or anywhere in eu for that matter ) it 's hilariously cheap compared to us . 
   would n't have repealed do n't ask do n't tell so what , there were no gay military members before that publicity stunt ? 
  seriously ... what i was actually talking about was the extension of the patriot act , the gitmo business , militarization of the police force , growing prison population , extensive and unwarranted military operations in the middle east and africa , [ drone strikes on us citizens ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/opinion/the-drone-that-killed-my-grandson.html?_r=1&amp; ) , massive surveillance programs , torture practices , economic kickbacks and bailouts , you know , shit that actually matters . 
  but hay , at least gays can go to army now , amirite ? 
  no one cares that us states have [ the same * gay propaganda * laws as russia does ] ( http://southfloridagaynews.com/national/american-states-with-gay-propaganda-laws-similar-to-putin-s-russia.html ) though . 
  or that gays in us can not donate blood or organs . 
  and that [ gay bashing is on the rise in usa ] ( http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-07-31-lgbt-violence-lesbian-gay-transgender-bisexual-survey_n.htm ) . 
   but there comes a point where you cross from exaggeration to nonsense exaggeration ? 
  would it be an exaggeration to say that in us you could end up in jail for [ posting stupid shit on twitter ] ( http://aattp.org/investigating-death-threats-against-obama-has-become-a-full-time-job-for-the-secret-service/ ) ? 
  in russia you can write a book about cutting putins head off and sticking your dick in it and nothing will happen . 
  you could have wrote that about bush while he still was in power an nothing would happen . 
  that 's just a [ taste of things to come ] ( http://www.salon.com/2014/01/14/jailing_of_an_alabama_blogger_its_worse_than_we_thought/ ) really . 
  and would it be an exaggeration to mention that us has the [ highest incarceration rate in the world ] ( http://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie.html ) ? 
  it 's hilarious to discuss freedoms and liberties in us while keeping that little factoid in mind . 
  or the [ dog-issued search warrants ] ( http://thestateweekly.com/scotus-approves-search-warrants-issued-by-dogs/ ) . 
  or the practice of [ institutionalized sodomy ] ( http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2013_11_07/new-mexico-man-sues-police-over-rectal-search-nightmare-1052/ ) . 
  or [ spending several years in jail for walking while black ] ( http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/11/25/2987871/teen-jailed-rikers-3-years-conviction-trial/# ) without charge or a trial . 
  how about [ selling teens to private prisons ] ( http://www.examiner.com/article/pennsylvania-judge-sentenced-to-28-years-prison-for-selling-teens-to-prisons ) ? 
  wake the fuck up . 
  can you tell me , what is it exactly that makes putin * so much worse * than obama ? 
  what can possibly evoke such a righteous indignation at a sole mention of their similarity , going so far as to dismiss it as * absolute nonsense * ? 
   the same man who stays in power through stealing public money and funneling it to mega-wealthy oligarchs . 
  yeah , how about obama 's [ solyndra gig ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/solyndra-politics-infused-obama-energy-programs/2011/12/14/giqa4hllhp_story.html ) ? 
  or [ numerous other ones ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/13/nation/la-na-smallpox-20111113 ) ? 
  and it 's not like you 're going to [ hear about it either ] ( http://www.newsmax.com/politics/sharyl-attkisson-cbs-solyndra-fast/2014/03/10/id/557202/ ) . 
  and how about running a billion-dollar spying program to keep track of your citizens ? 
  obama sifts through billions of public money and the amounts that get squandered are quite staggering . 
   i do n't think you can really pin obama as evil . 
  incompetent and weak ?
