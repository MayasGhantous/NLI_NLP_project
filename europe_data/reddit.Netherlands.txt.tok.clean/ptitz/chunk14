  that 's not unlikely  russian just should leave them alone and let them be . 
  many russians are calling for that . 
  i do n't think that would be in the best interest of chechnya or russia . 
  without russian aid the republic would be devastated . 
  and russia would get a neighbor with islamic extremists in charge . 
  take into account that most of them are militants and the number goes down every year . 
  if you want to compare , in 2010 there were 78 civilian deaths in chechnya . 
  in a region of 5 million people thats 1/60 000 . 
  in the same year there were 2777 civilian casualties in afghanistan . 
  in a region with 30 million people thats 1/10 000 . 
  and afghanistan is an impoverished hellhole while chechnya is one of the most prosperous regions in russia . 
  i ca n't find the 2010 number for iraq , but in 2013 there were almost 8000 . 
  in a 34 million country thats 1/4250 . 
  in lybia , population 5.6 million , no one is even counting . 
  current estimates are that at least 5-7 thousands civilians died in the war ( that would be 1/1000 ) and they are still dying due to unrest . 
  so yes , compared to nato interventions russians are doing a great job . 
  the russians are there to keep the place stable and free of islamic radicals . 
  and so far they are doing a way better job at it than nato during any of their recent freedom-bringing endeavors . 
   if chechnya would be a free country if chechnya would be a * free * country it would n't enjoy half of the freedoms that it has right now as a russian republic . 
  it would be just another fucked up sharia state rotting away , much like afghanistan in the 90s . 
  what 's the point ? 
  well , no shit . 
  but suggesting that these guys are blowing up buses and cutting heads off in the name of liberal values and democratic freedoms is idiotic to put it mildly . 
  and currently the government of russia and the government of chechnya are the only ones who keep these guys at bay . 
  no , the current guerilla uprising are islamic radicals . 
  would you want islamic radicals in charge of chechnya ? 
  do you think anyone in chechnya wants islamic radicals in charge ? 
  seriously ... 
   the people are seeing small benefits no , the people are getting more than enough . 
  look [ here ] ( http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2013/05/chechnya_daily_life.html ) . 
  and read the comments . 
  like i said , chechnya is doing better right now than most regions in central russia . 
  can you show me what chechnyans problems are ? 
  simple question . 
  i am not talking about the islamic radical groups . 
  they plant car bombs in city centers for crying out loud , no one likes them . 
  what part of chechnyan civilian population actually supports them ? 
  what are the problems that chechnyans have right now with the russian government ? 
  well , thats what kadyrov calls it anyway ... 
  still , chechnya and grozny had massive developments in past decade . 
  it 's way better off than most regions in central russia . 
   you do n't know what the chechens think and you do ?? 
  please do share , what do chechnyans lament about their current situation right now ? 
  laugh all you want , putin would get his votes with falsifications or without . 
  he does n't need them , he 's popular enough . 
  especially in places like chechnya . 
   why would n't they want independence ? 
  because right now chechnya is incredibly supportive of the russian government . 
  and also because they receive massive amounts of investment funds from moscow . 
   why they hate russia where did you get that idea ? 
  chechnya loves russia right now . 
   deportation of all the chechens to siberia during stalin who cares about that anymore ? 
  right now the russians are fond of pumping billions into the region . 
  the cities that had been leveled in chechen campaigns had been re-built with russian money . 
  grozny is now the home of [ biggest mosque in europe ] ( http://filarma.ru/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/1351086562_325220_12.jpg ) among other things . 
  chechnya is massively rich . 
  99 % of chechnyans voted putin in the last elections . 
  why on earth would chechnya want independence ? 
  edit : inb4 i get downvoted into oblivion ... can anyone name me some genuine grievances of chechen populace that are not related to events that happened decades or centuries ago ? 
  i mean seriously , who in chechnya would want independence of the republic of chechnya ? 
  ah , [ the guardian ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gogv6fvc8wc ) . 
  seriously ? 
  murica scored higher than most eu countries on personal freedom ? 
  do n't they have the highest incarceration rate in the world ? 
  they are sending kids to prison for posting stupid shit on twitter for crying out loud . 
  and israel did n't even make it to the top 100 ? 
  wow . 
   not available yet exactly . 
  not yet . 
  but it will be , very soon . 
   solar , wind : too expensive , lots of maintenance , technologies are n't ` on point ' yet wind is actually pretty well integrated already . 
  spain is already producing [ 1/5th ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/06/wind-power-spain-electricity-2013 ) of its electrical energy using wind power . 
  portugal had achieved as much as [ 70 % output ] ( http://oilprice.com/latest-energy-news/world-news/portugal-generated-70-of-energy-from-renewable-sources-in-first-quarter.html ) last year . 
  the only technological issue right now is storage of all this energy , and there are more and more new and efficient ways to do that . 
   nuclear : too much pressure from green groups , generally mistrusted by the populace there are new developments in nuclear power as well . 
  to me , as an engineer , nuclear power actually seems like the most efficient and * clean * of all power sources available today . 
  and these days you have the [ closed-loop cycles ] ( http://analysis.nuclearenergyinsider.com/operations-maintenance/nuclear-fuel-cycles-close-or-not-close ) being developed . 
  the waste that they produce is much less toxic than the conventional open cycle and they can potentially produce more energy than they consume . 
  this technology is still expensive , but it definitely has a future . 
   shale gas : same as above once again , it is just a matter of technology . 
  i am not that familiar with shale gas , but i see no reason for it to remain untapped as the methods of mining it are improving , especially considering the abundance of it . 
   coal : horrible for the environment not as horible as [ meat industry ] ( http://encognitive.com/node/2186 ) for example . 
  coal is n't going anywhere and there are [ very impresive developments ] ( http://www.co2-cato.org/cato-2/locations/regions/western-netherlands/eon-maasvlakte ) in this field as well . 
   am i missing something here ? 
  yes . 
  geothermals , hydro power , biomass power , [ molten salt storage ] ( http://cleantechnica.com/2009/11/03/united-technologies-rocket-scientists-to-build-150-mw-solar-heliostat-in-sonoran-desert/ ) , there are many more . 
  norway is actually [ running out of garbage ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/30/world/europe/oslo-copes-with-shortage-of-garbage-it-turns-into-energy.html?_r=0 ) right now . 
  the technologies are there , they are being developed , tested and implemented , it wo n't be long for them to become widespread and eventually replace what we got already . 
  it is a highly politicized issue with many misconceptions on both sides . 
  i do n't think it should be . 
  in the long run renewables can be just as viable economically as conventional sources . 
  alternative energy is of course by no means * clean * , but it is * renewable * , so there really is no reason to panic that we will run out of fuel any time soon . 
  much less reasons to worry about reliance on imported fuel . 
   because russia is offering competitive prices not really . 
  germany actually [ signed a deal ] ( http://blogs.marketwatch.com/energy-ticker/2013/06/03/canadian-lng-project-inks-deal-with-german-utility-giant/ ) with canadians for liquified gas and its still cheaper than buying from russia . 
  russian oil and gas are far from the cheapest on the market . 
  they are using outdated , unproductive methods to mine it . 
  they do have the advantage of location and abundance . 
  but as technology develops i would expect less trade with russia and iran , if not for political then for economical and technological reasons . 
   99 % + of the world population they are missing out .
