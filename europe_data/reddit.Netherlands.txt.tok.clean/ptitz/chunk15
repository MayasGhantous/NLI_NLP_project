  special olympics are fucking awesome . 
  like once you had this guy with no arms play table tennis against a guy with muscle dystrophy . 
  and [ amputee swimming ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oxidposlle ) is hardcore . 
  and they also have [ wheelchair tennis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thsdarc7wxk ) . 
  seriously , paralympics  regular olympics . 
  well , eu did send several thousands troops to iraq and to afghanistan . 
  in iraq poland went in with the invasion forces . 
  frenchies and italians have tens of thousands of troops stationed abroad right now . 
  at any given time almost every european army has a mission assigned somewhere . 
  russians , on other hand , had a bunch of separatist insurgency conflicts where they did not fare well . 
  and a 4-day long conflict with georgia where they managed to lose a bunch of planes to a country with no air superiority measures . 
  other than that it was all parades and no action . 
  maintaining world police is less economical , yes . 
  us spends a lot of money on their armed forces , it is very impressive . 
  but that 's partly because a large chunk of what they pump into it just goes down the drain in the end . 
  look at all the procurement programs in recent years that got scrambled in the end . 
  the comanche , the future combat systems . 
  the whole jsf , and the jltv drama . 
  mraps being cut for scrap metal . 
  v-22s crashing and burning . 
  yurop might not have the same exuberant spending or the same drive to actually engage , but it is definitely better with the books and i definitely would n't call european armies boy scouts with guns . 
  they are very well equipped and they are always on active missions . 
  russia is neither . 
  i was impressed to see all the pictures of russian soldiers wearing modernized uniforms and driving new fancy trucks . 
  but you gotto keep in mind that they only had it for two years , before that they just had the [ leftover gear from the time the soviets went to afghanistan ] ( http://media.npr.org/assets/news/2010/04/06/russia_custom-d6553cf45c567b013f208f90e597752950a4e159-s6-c30.jpg ) . 
  i was surprised they scrambled enough fancy new gear to pose these guys in front of the camera . 
  it 's almost comical , really . 
  if a gripen was ever to fight an f/a -18 1v1 , both having capable pilots , i 'd put my money on the gripen . 
  it is lighter , it is more agile . 
  it has lower wing loading so it has a much lower turn radius . 
  and fly-by-wire canard configuration allows it to be more maneuverable in general . 
  it would basically fly loops and circles around an f/a -18 . 
  sure f/a -18 could carry more democracy on board . 
  but flight performance-wise it would be like letting a sports bike race against an old bimmer full of gypsies . 
  in addition to that , gripens are less complex than f/a -18 , with just one engine . 
  so they can spend less time on the ground and they are cheaper to maintain . 
  do n't be hatin , gripens are awesome . 
  meeh , this guy is kind of clueless . 
   are we supposed to believe that putin had more power over big ukraine than over little georgia and moldova ? 
  maybe he should brush up on his history . 
  moldova is pissed off at russia over transnistria and georgia is pissed off at them over ossetia . 
  why the hell would either of them listen to putin ? 
  not to mention that the whole process was initiated while yushenko was still in power . 
   not even the authors of the wikipedia entry can find anything about what the agreement actually said . 
  oh wow , well if its not even on wikipedia ... [ took me literally 1 minute ] ( http://euroua.com/docs/eu-ukraine-association-agreement_en.pdf ) to find it . 
  i get the concerns about rabid nationalists in charge , but the russian narrative in this whole thing is not just biased , its plain nonsense . 
  yeah , thing is , us can spend a trillion on a war like it \u00b4 s nothing . 
  russia can not . 
  they lost several billions in 4 days in georgia . 
  and that was at a time when they had the highest economy growth . 
  nowadays things are not so certain economically , so they would play it safe . 
  and talking about strong military , they still managed to lose a bunch of planes in a country with no real air defense systems . 
  so yeah ... 
   those shitty jobs where you work hard all day long , without care for the weather , and you are still paid a misery . 
  nothing miserable about working construction . 
  you can earn 80-100e a day as a starter , working for an agency , 200-300e working as a contractor with your own gear . 
  if you got your own crew you earn way more . 
  like i said , the only ones paid minimum wage are the cleaners and the migrant workers . 
  weather does matter , the hours that you work in the rain are paid the same as the weekend hours , 40 % extra . 
  one thing is that the work is seasonal , there is more work in the winter than in the summer . 
  so yes , sometimes there is a lot of work so they bring in the guys from other countries , sometimes there is just none . 
  especially nowadays , with the whole housing crunch . 
  this mis-perception that these jobs are shitty or underpaid may be one of the reasons that unemployment is so high , but in the end it is a mis-perception . 
   populations in europe have a severe lack of motivation to do physical jobs . 
  where did you get that idea ? 
  i 've worked construction in the netherlands for 2 years . 
  there are a lot of polish migrants in the sector , but the vast majority are dutch . 
  and overall the migrants are usually used for unskilled labor like demolition and cleaning up while the actual work is done by the locals . 
  especially on the big projects , where you would have migration officers come over and check that everyone is legal every other week . 
  i do n't think russia would dare . 
  it 's one thing to go to ossetia , a disputed territory , and another is to go to war with ukraine , a real country with 10 times the population of georgia bordering the eu . 
  yeah , eligibility for welfare/subsidies is mostly shared between member-states . 
  ca n't be that hard finding money if the kid is willing to move . 
  well , its eu . 
  anyone can go anywhere these days .

  murican passports are pretty sweet . 
  with the indians and mountains and all that on every page . 
  depends on type of residence you have in the eu . 
  if you have a eu passport , you could enter uk with a card . 
  if you got only a residence permit , then you would need a visa in the passport of your country of origin . 
  what do you put in the meat ? 
  and the potatoes ? 
  maybe i make it next week ... 
  just give azerbaijan 10-15 years or so , your ukip guys are going to have a blast with them in the eu ... 
  one thing that had all europeans united for so long ? 
  a farce ? 
  a lie ? 
  is there nothing sacred anymore !!!?? 
   the guys that appear in these videos do i can guarantee you that all of them were seeking sexual relations with a minor . 
  all the ones featuring tesak . 
  why does n't any article describing tesak activities ever mention that ? 
  does [ this guy showing up to fuck 13 year old girl ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfc6ih5jbge ) look like a homosexual ? 
  yeah , and here i am being downvoted as a gay bashing asshole for pointing out all the bullshit in western reports . 
  can you explain me the difference between [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zauc0ztqggi ) and [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wff9e4fb4bg ) ? 
  half of these guys tesak shows end up in jail for pedophilia . 
  including the one in the video . 
  do you think that adult men who want to have sex with kids and * lgbt teenagers between the ages of 14 and 16 * are the same ? 
  i must be fucking delusional .
