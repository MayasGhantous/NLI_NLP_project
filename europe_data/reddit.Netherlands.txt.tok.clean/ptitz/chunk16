  i must be seeing things . 
  surely [ this guy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbgstazv98g ) is a tender teenager on the inside . 
  and [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kgbs33ew7o ) . 
  and [ this guy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pv-pmmxnhy ) obviously . 
  [ this one has a girl as a bait ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfc6ih5jbge ) . 
  surely he was just confused that he was about to have a date with a consenting adult . 
  this is not bullshit . 
  and i know it because i actually speak russian and i understand what is going on in these videos . 
  and when i read reports in english , aimed at people who do n't speak russian i see all the discrepancies in them . 
  and i see all the sensationalizing going on . 
  because * russian neo nazi beats up lgbt teenagers * has more ring to it than * russian neo nazi beats up sexual predators . 
  probably got the idea from an american tv show * . 
  and by the way , he was arrested on a charge of extremism and hatred incitement . 
  not beating up an iraqi . 
  the actual grounds for his arrest were some film reviews he posted on youtube , where he says that the russian army acted like a gang of mercenaries in ww2 . 
  he himself says that he is being charged because one of his pedo videos featured a [ law officer who solicited sex from a 14 year old ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcm8dttcnw8 ) . 
  there is a big difference between reporting a real issue and reporting knowingly false facts . 
  all occupy pedofilai videos starring tesak feature adult men who solicited sex from minors . 
  that 's why hes not in jail . 
  because nobody reports him . 
  there is no conspiracy . 
  i 'm not justifying anything . 
  but reporting false information is not exactly helping anyones case here . 
  yeah , the thing is , the baits are not always teenage boys . 
  they use girls also . 
  and the majority of victims are [ adult men ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lalygf0uw_8 ) . 
   reportedly targeting lgbt teenagers between the ages of 14 and 16 you see , this part is actually bullshit . 
  tesak ( the mohawk guy ) is actually not so much against gay people . 
  he 's more like a russian neo-nazi version of chris hansen and focuses on pedophiles , not homosexuals . 
  and no one wants to go file a report about being beaten up for soliciting sex with minors . 
   you have to pay about $ 330 each month ... 
  in netherlands being self-employed is free pretty much . 
  i was hiking in pyrenees in october once , at 2km altitude , it was actually quite all right . 
  at night it can get chilly , but like warm sweater and an autumn coat chilly . 
  yeah , heineken is terrible . 
  well i 've learned about it when i was in aragon so yeah , you could start there in any case . 
  you could try to walk [ camino de santiago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/way_of_st._james ) . 
  its in the pyrenees , quite scenic . 
  and if you register you get a seashell and a special paper with which you can stay at the hostels for free of very cheap . 
   or you could , like , not spend money you do n't have . 
  yeah , cause cutting on development projects does marvels to economy and employment . 
  just ask spain . 
   in the uk , for instance , only 11 people have been killed by police in this millennium . 
  [ of all the countries you pick uk ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jul/19/deaths-police-custody-data ) seriously ? 
  there were several hundred people killed by police in this millennium already . 
  why not just go with somalia ... or us for that matter . 
   i said they have more rights , their incarceration rate is irrelevant . 
  yeah , more rights . 
  if they actually manage to capture you alive ( 300 people killed by us officers last year , probably more than that in reality ) you will have the right to either [ plead guilty ] ( http://wrongfulconvictionsblog.org/2012/05/30/why-do-innocents-plead-guilty/ ) to something you may or may not have commited , to avoid 10 years of trial . 
  or the right to [ be sold to a private jail ] ( http://www.examiner.com/article/pennsylvania-judge-sentenced-to-28-years-prison-for-selling-teens-to-prisons ) if you are set at proving your innocence . 
  where did you actually get that idea that americans have more rights ? 
  law & order ? 
   you do realise that `` rose '' is past tense ( verleden tijd ) , right ? 
  you do realize that first you say that the houses are too expensive and then go on to complain about the housing bubble , that happens because houses are losing their value ? 
  make up your mind . 
   i do n't think lutjebroek counts . 
  how about rotterdam ? 
   yeah , because that was my point . 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 yeah , because increasing mortgage interests will surely do wonders to demand on housing market , flaccid as it is because of the housing bubble . 
  i hear spaniards bitching about their country all the time and this is actually the first good overview i 've read . 
   only one of them does not see economic growth as a necessity . 
  good . 
   we 've got insane private debt because guess what , growing your economy is the best way to fix private debt . 
   this is why we 're a tax haven yeah , if you talk about corporate taxes . 
  which are retarded to begin with . 
  half of us companies have trillions locked abroad because of corporate taxation . 
  with no chance of ever flowing back into the country 's economy . 
  and another half just has friends in the congress who give them preferential treatment over others and allow them to avoid paying anything at all . 
  it 's a scam . 
   the number of people killed by police is much higher than in surrounding countries . 
  what , how much higher ? 
  what countries ? 
  where does this come from ? 
   if you get arrested in the us , you have more rights than you do here . 
  are you joking ? 
  in the country with the highest incarceration rate * in the world * ? 
   it does n't matter if you 've lived here for decades , speak the language and have had children here . 
  it does matter if you never bothered to organize yourself a residence permit before coming to nl . 
  that 's just dumb . 
  it 's even dumber if you spend decades in the country running away from migration officers . 
  and even then , i 've met so many fucked up people who somehow managed to stick around that i wonder if they filter them at all . 
   and when houses do get built , they 're often expensive . 
   since housing prices always rose . 
  actually they have been [ falling for good 5 years by now ] ( http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/europe/netherlands/price-history ) . 
  you are making a contradiction here . 
  houses that do get built now are really worth shit . 
  thats how the bubble works . 
  you invest into a house , thinking that the prices will rise forever . 
  and after they start falling you 're stuck with the house which is worth half the price listed on your mortgage . 
  the market is saturated with undervalued housing everywhere right now . 
  if you really want a house , now would be the time to buy one , before the market stabilizes and the prices start rising again . 
   and if you rent you 're fucked too since rentals were privatized and those corporations need big offices and high wages for the ceos . 
  i 'm renting a flat from a corporation in the middle of the city for 320e/month utilities excluded . 
  i receive 140e/month housing subsidy . 
  total , with all the utility bills and discounting the subsidy , i pay 340e a month netto . 
  and thats not just a studio , its a flat . 
  i have a bedroom , a living-room and a big balcony . 
  can you name me one major city in central europe where this would be possible ? 
  more than half of major city inhabitants in the netherlands live in social rentals .
