  certainly no less than your typical entitled highschool dropout who had the fortune of being born with an eu passport and raised in a quasi-socialist welfare state . 
  not that it should even matter . 
  why is there so much obsession with catering to * productive members of society * , throwing every other group of undesirables under the bus ? 
  yeah , and it 's a [ big fucking failure ] ( http://theconversation.com/nauru-nightmare-immigration-policy-and-australias-concentration-camp-12071 ) no matter how you look at it . 
  i 'd imagine people in this country would be wiser . 
  ah , the endl\u00f6sung , perhaps the most cherished european tradition ... 
   unemployment rate i 'd love to see some formal study that would establish a causal link between influx of migrants and rising unemployment rates . 
  as far as i know it had been dismissed as nonsense many times already . 
  well , you would gladly host 400k germans , but 20k syrian war refugees is too much . 
  reasons being that germans are cool , supposedly more likely to succeed ( whatever that entails ) and readily embrace western culture and whatnot . 
  you say that it 's  a matter of morals , money , ** space ** and people . 
  i think the ** space ** matter is a non-issue at the current level of migration . 
  moral matter is also pretty straight-forward as i see it : a german migrant could return to his cosy quasi-socialist welfare state any time while a syrian refugee probably had his house blown up already and would have his entire family beheaded if he were ever to come back . 
  i think morally deporting germans makes more sense than deporting syrians . 
  as for money , like i said , if you take the excise tax from tobacco in this country you could fill up an entire city size of leiden with just refugees on welfare . 
  money is a non-issue . 
  well , if you start saying that * germans integrate better * then it is n't at all the same as * there is not enough space * . 
  since evidently there is no shortage of actual physical space . 
  it 's rather that the attitude is very different towards migrants of different descent . 
   will always be below the average level of knowledge of say a regular dutchman  able to perform a myriad of complex tasks , where the same will not apply to immigrants with little prior knowledge  even then they can hardly be called on par with the population here . 
  that 's complete and utter nonsense . 
  do you seriously think that all foreigners are inherently dumber than a typical dutch teenager ? 
   ever dutch kid enjoyed the benefits of a good system of education how much do you even remember of what you 've been taught in highschool ? 
  all i remember is playing videogames and drinking with my classmates . 
  i can assure you that it is pretty international . 
   simple and easy to automatize jobs will become largely extinct in the next 20-30 years no they wo n't and even if they will , this is an issue for * everyone * , not just refugees . 
   immigrants first need a lot of investing a kid costs something like 200k euros , just to get a highschool diploma . 
  you can teach an adult migrant a phd in chemistry for that money . 
  are you suggesting that non-european migrants do n't work ? 
  part of these budget cuts related to migrants actually slash the programs aimed in assisting them in integration . 
  i have a friend who used to be a social worker doing just that , and she was laid off a couple of years back . 
  do you suppose that kicking people out on the streets and denying working permits serves some higher purpose of making them * look after themselves * and * actually producing money * ? 
  some syrian refugee fleeing from a warzone would find anything short of mass executions a more accommodating environment than staying in his home country . 
  including illegal status and a bench in vondelpark . 
  these people are n't going anywhere , you ca n't just turn them away or ship them off . 
  the next time you go to an indoor atm there will be a war refugee sleeping on the floor . 
  maybe you will adjust and become blind to them at some point , but i do n't think it 's the way it should be . 
  well , there are like 400k germans living in the netherlands . 
  if we are so short on space , why not start with them ? 
  i can imagine taking in grown-ass adults and putting them straight to work saves a whole lot of cash as opposed to raising some kid for 18 years , with medical bills and everything , putting that kid through ( public-funded ) school and * then * putting that kid to work . 
  i am actually quite happy that those migrants have a place to stay and food to eat . 
  as opposed to sleeping on bus stops , train stations and camping out in public parks , getting by with begging and peddling stuff on the streets , like they do in every other eu country . 
  but the politicians just have to go and fuck it up for everyone , do n't they ... 
  i mean 20k migrants ? 
  that 's like half of hoogvliet borough . 
  that 's what , 200-250 million a year maybe , for food and housing ? 
  * this * strains our social welfare system ? 
  1 euro/month/nl citizen ? 
  there 's 3 million smokers in this country , spending something like 100 euro/month on tobacco . 
  that 's 3.6 billion euros a year . 
  at 7 euros/pack , with 4.2 euros worth of excise tax , you could fund this entire population by taking 50 cents out of that . 
  there , problem solved . 
   none of the technology oracle would disagree . 
  but then still , at least dalvik is open-source and runs on qnx . 
  it 's not about vms themselves , it 's about proprietary libraries that get bundled with it . 
  as a person not relying on google too much , to me this sounds great . 
  it 's especially frustrating what they are doing to android . 
  all the new apps that come out for it require google play services , which are proprietary and locked to android platform , which makes it impossible to run on anything else . 
  which is ridiculous , since in theory they should run on any java vm , irrespective of os ( android , linux , qnx , even windows ... ) . 
  and java is not even googles technology . 
  it 's basically the same thing that microsoft did with their directx , forever cementing windows as the gaming platform . 
  i think explaining all the subtleties would make it a very lengthy and unfunny cartoon . 
  sounds like forced labor . 
  it 's settled then . 
  you better start writing up a draft to pass on to european comission . 
  do n't forget those get shit-faced days !, 
  [ we switch to base 12 then ] ( http://io9.com/5977095/why-we-should-switch-to-a-base-12-counting-system ) . 
  12 months just makes sense because of the moon and you could go on from there . 
  start counting everything in dozens , halves and thirds . 
  it would be brilliant . 
   imperial system no , imperial system does n't make * any * fucking sense . 
  at least in decimal there are only 2 primes : 2 and 5 . 
  [ base-6 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/senary ) would also be fine with 2 and 3 . 
  maybe even better , for trigonometry and stuff . 
  but for example with * length * in imperial , if you start with inch and go up to a mile then you have 2,3,5 and 11 , thats 4 primes . 
  for volume you have 2 and 5 , which is fine in itself , except it has * no correlation * with actual length units . 
  while for weight you use 2,7,11 . 
  like when do you ever have to divide anything in 11 equal parts ? 
  it 's madness . 
  although a system based purely on [ godel numbering ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%b6del_numbering ) would be pretty neat . 
  10 you can only divide by 2 or 5 . 
  24 you can divide by 2,3,4,6,8 and 12 . 
  way better . 
  aerosonde laima was programmed to do just one mission , in one weather envelope . 
  and it still had to do manual take-off and landing . 
  flying in a long straight line , when all your sensors are functional , is hardly challenging . 
  but if there was any sort of contingency this aircraft would just plunge into the ground . 
  autopilots can not deal with contingencies . 
  and that msl lander was programmed to do one thing and one thing only , in a specific set of conditions . 
  and the chances of success for it most certainly were n't 99.9999 % . 
  most mars missions * fail * . 
  they have something like [ 30 % rate of success ] ( http://www.wired.com/2012/08/failure-to-reach-mars/ ) when reaching the surface . 
  you can tout one mission as a success , but that 's hardly an indicator of how reliable those things actually are . 
  moreover , prior to landing the probe had carefully mapped the entire area of it 's intended touchdown and there were hundreds of people carefully orchestrating every single stage of it 's descent . 
  it 's hardly as simple as just sending that thing to mars and watch it land all on it 's own . 
  the entire process was scheduled and supervised . 
  like a single predator drone requires something like 200 people to plan and execute a mission . 
  in a complex system a process can not be fully modeled . 
  so you need a human to complement automation . 
  but since humans make mistakes , some decision making is automated .
