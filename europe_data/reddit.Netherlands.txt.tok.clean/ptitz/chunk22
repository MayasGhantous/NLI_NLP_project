  well , where do you think * fossil fuels * come from ? 
  they do n't just appear out of nowhere , no ? 
  it 's all trees and dinosaurs and all these things that absorbed carbon from the atmosphere once upon a time . 
  that 's as carbon-neutral as it gets . 
  on the contrary , maybe if you did n't burn that tree it would turn into a rock eventually . 
  it 's not carbon neutral , that 's a myth . 
  and in reality it 's not that much better than burning coal . 
  combustion chemistry and it 's byproducts are pretty similar , no matter what you burn . 
  a380 was designed with congested airports in mind . 
  like if you could only do 5 flights to heathrow in one day , might as well haul 600 passengers . 
  and these rules and regulations are only becoming tighter every year . 
  i could see it being more relevant in the near future , maybe not just yet . 
  efficiency in airline operations is a tricky concept that depends on many factors , besides sheer size and how much fuel it guzzles . 
  mohammed daoud khan had a nice gig going . 
  stood up for women rights , patched pakistan ties , led a secular government . 
  preferred non-alliance with both us and ussr . 
  but yeah , then he told brezhnev not to meddle in afghan internal affairs and the rest is history . 
  maybe afghanistan was n't switzerland or anything , but it was * all right * , really . 
  definitely would n't be the shithole it is nowadays if it was n't for the whole taraki fiasco . 
  i would . 
  finland is nice . 
  hard to tell ... 
  that 's the thing , it * is * quite far-fetched . 
  there are all sorts of theories going around . 
  like the one where he was actually killed somewhere else , at a different time , and then dragged to the alleged crime scene . 
  supported with all sorts of inductive evidence . 
  sure , if you squint hard enough it * kind of * makes sense . 
  only it 's bullshit , obviously . 
  like this one with nemtsov being killed over hebdo comments . 
  i mean shit , what * were * these comments ? 
  in what context ? 
  i ca n't find anything , can you ? 
  sure , they would . 
  but then nemtsov was * far * from the most vocal supporters of hebdo cartoons or the like . 
  it would actually take some digging through everything he said and did to pinpoint what exactly could 've pissed them off so much , and there are plenty of easier targets , most of whom do n't have a police unit following them at every step . 
  the general attitude here is that being homeless is a * choice * , given all the social fallback schemes in place . 
  i 've talked to some of these guys , they are apparently entitled to a monthly allowance of something like 500-600 euros , so there 's that . 
  some of the `` homeless '' are not even homeless , they do live in a house somewhere . 
  but in the end it 's more of a mental health issue than hardcore poverty . 
  many of them actually did pretty well in their past lives , but then something went wrong and they eventually ended on the streets . 
  like this one guy i met was an engineer , became an alcoholic . 
  lost his job , his wife left him , now he 's homeless . 
  has higher education , speaks like 5 languages but ca n't really hold on to a job or a house anymore . 
  there are government-run programs that put people like that in employment , find housing for them . 
  but often people keep it up for a few months and then they are back in the streets for one reason or another . 
  still , i 've been around europe , and i think the whole situation is dealt with pretty well , compared to other countries . 
  like [ this kind of stuff ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/02/article-2383855-1b1e171f000005dc-489_634x414.jpg ) is a big no-no around here and i hope it stays this way . 
  * whom, 
  actually , [ here ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%b1%d1%80%d0%be%d1%88%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9+%d0%bf%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b1%d1%83%d1%80%d0%b3&amp;tbs=imgo:1&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=bcwdvrpgaoh4yqpnmkpyba ) is a nice query for you . 
  knock yourself out !, 
  i googled some for you , see [ here ] ( http://www.blog-fiesta.com/spb/places/ruiny-dvortsa-advokata-so-skulpturami-oleney/ ) , [ here ] ( http://insurgent.ru/content/zabroshki-piter-i-oblast ) , and [ here ] ( http://forestier.livejournal.com/133869.html ) . 
  couple of years ago i went to some underground club in saint petersburg , and it was basically a massive palace crumbling down . 
  was pretty cool . 
  i 've seen something similar in saint petersburg , when they filmed `` der untergang '' movie . 
  the logic was that berlin was all fixed up since the war , but in saint petersburg there were all these nicely crumbled historical buildings that looked like berlin after it was bombed . 
  [ rotterdam rotterdam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spj1cttvdvg ), 
  i 'd have more sympathy for them if they actually got rid of the bits that prevent android apps running on other operating systems . 
  it 's openjdk ffs , they should be able to run on anything . 
  maybe it used to be , like 20 years ago . 
  nowadays it 's pretty hip . 
  some friends of mine ( a couple , late 20s/early 30s ) were considering getting a house loan just recently . 
  no bank would give it to them , citing their lack of long-term contract or whatever . 
  they do have quite a bit of income going between the two of them , but the banks are pretty cautious right now . 
  most young people i know who own a house now got their parents involved one way or another . 
  so yeah , i do n't know about starting a family ( must be a cultural thing ) , but getting a house is definitely difficult right now . 
  my mom , on the other hand , works part time and she got a housing loan without much trouble just recently . 
  maybe banks just hate young people . 
  because you hate yourself . 
  i 'm sure they are feeling fantastic . 
  but besides racists and women-haters , there are all sorts of people that feel good about trump victory . 
  and making sweeping generalizations like that wo n't sway them to change their support to someone else . 
  you do n't see trump going around calling sanders or even clinton supporters silly cunts . 
  that 's what makes for good populism . 
  as a bbos user : fuck you google . 
  newer blackberries actually ran android apps , until newer proprietary google android api updates made most apps incompatible . 
  and talking about pre-loaded apps : my girlfriends android phone is nearly unusable since every google app update eats up the space on her phone and she ca n't save shit to memory card anymore since whatever android update . 
  because there is a clear lack of unsubstantiated bullshit in political discourse atm ...  trump 's victory is one of the biggest calamities to befall the west and the effect is that every racist , woman-hater , homophobe and rightwing authoritarian feels vindicated . 
  articles like that is the reason trump won in the first place . 
   even so , the fact that they , as an unicameral house , even have to ask , strongly undermines their authority . 
  they do n't have to * ask * anything . 
  it is parliament 's job to decide on legislation . 
  it is commission job to work out the technicalities , e.g. 
  how to make it happen . 
  they are not * obliged * to do absolutely everything the parliament tells them to do . 
  but frankly , this had never led to any problems or conflicts so far so it 's really a non-issue . 
   meanwhile , the parliament itself has no ability to propose legislation , it can only vote on what is presented ( as i understand it ) . 
  the parliament can pass an initiative down to commission to develop a legislation . 
  and the commission has to consider it . 
  there were very few cases where commission rejected a parliament initiative , and they were all tied to technicalities afaik . 
  other than that , the parliament proposes legislation all the time , it 's their job . 
  as for calling juncker * analogous to head of state * , that 's quite an overstatement , since there is nothing he or his commission is capable of doing on their own without explicit approval from the eu parliament and the eu council . 
  i think brexit had been more effective in cooling off populist sentiment . 
  if anything , us going to shit shall serve as a further warning against voting for populist leaders and initiatives . 
  before the war something like 30-40 % of chechnyan population were ethnic russians . 
  after the war it was less than 3 % . 
  if by familiar you mean an ethnic conflict a la kosovo then yeah . 
  it was n't just some bogus peace-keeping mission . 
  nice one , sweden ... 
  it was the same way with drugs i think . 
  churches like pauluskerk offered shelter and were running clean needle exchanges/dispensing methadone and whatever to hard drug users way before the cities stepped in .
