  there 's one like that here in rotterdam : [ unilever hq ] ( https://www.unilever.com/images/unilever-rotterdam-de-brug-990x557_tcm244-420489_w720.jpg ) . 
  gripen is still a better aircraft though . 
  typhoon is for when the brits feel an imperial itch . 
  gripen is for when you need an aircraft that can be fully tanked and prepped for a mission in 20 minutes , and that can take off and land on an icy highway if it needs to . 
  also it 's probably the most maneuverable western aircraft in production , with wing loading lower than f-15 or f-22 . 
  and with planned engine upgrades it will be superior to typhoon in air to air , climbing higher and and faster . 
  i 'm not going to disagree , but in the end it did come down to basically * fuck you , rosbief * and the two aircraft * are * pretty similar . 
  at least similar enough to just produce several typhoon versions , geared towards ground attack * or * air superiority zoom-zoom . 
  while slashing the price tag by half and maintaining parts commonality and unified maintenance procedures for the same aircraft across the eu . 
  i mean typhoon is just rafale but with bigger engines . 
  as if they did n't have enough platforms already . 
  instead it 's american , pan-european , french , swedish and russian aircraft scattered all over the place like pokemon gotto catch em all or something . 
   the actual difference in payload size is only 1.5 tons ( gripen with 6 and typhoon with 7.5 . ), 
  let 's do the math . 
  the empty weight of a jas-39d is 7100 kg . 
  mtow of a jas-39d is 14000 kg . 
  if you load it with 6000 kg of payload you will have like what , 900kg left for fuel ? 
  with a full tank ( 2,268 kg ) it has an operational radius of 500 miles . 
  given that a large portion of that fuel would be spent just climbing and landing , you would cut that radius down to like 100 miles . 
  it 's not a realistic scenario , since the aircraft would n't be operable anymore . 
  realistically , you could carry like 4632 kg useful payload with it , sans drop tanks . 
  empty weight of a typhoon is 11150 kg . 
  mtow of a typhoon is 23500 kg in overload . 
  it can carry 4500 kg in fuel , leaving you with 75 % more useful payload ( 7850kg ) than a gripen . 
  now let 's move on to the engines . 
  gripen engine is capable of 54kn of thrust , 80.5 kn with afterburner . 
  let 's say we have a gripen half-way through the mission that weighs 100 kn . 
  that 's a thrust/weight ratio of 0.8 . 
  typhoon has two engines , capable of up to 90 kn of thrust each ( ej200 ) . 
  let 's say we have a typhoon half-way through the mission , at 170 kn . 
  that 's a thrust/weight ratio of like 1.06 , 32 % higher than that of a gripen . 
  now let 's talk about migs . 
  a modernized mig-29 has a service ceiling of 16.2 km . 
  a typhoon can climb up to 16.75 km . 
  if a typhoon would encounter a mig it would release its armaments , climb up and get the fuck out of there . 
  a gripen can not climb that high . 
  it would have to engage the mig , which could go either way . 
  and you could do the same math for rafale c. 24500kg mtow-9850kg we = 14650 kg . 
  substract 4750 kg of fuel , leaves you with 9900kg available for useful payload . 
  which is 26 % ( 2050kg ) more than a typhoon ( and more than twice gripen payload ) , but then its thrust/weight is closer to gripen than typhoon , so it would run into the same troubles should it ever be deployed against a real air force . 
  the rafale is actually supposed to get beefier engines in the coming years , typhoon as well . 
  i would n't be surprised if they end up having identical specs after the upgrades . 
  not so fun historic tidbit : after jews , gypsies and the rest were freed from nazi camps and prisons , homosexuality remained on their penal code , so gays remained serving out their sentences . 
  half the size means it only carries half the payload . 
  it also has only one engine and less thrust/weight , meaning typhoon climbs faster and flies higher than gripen . 
  if they were to be deployed against , say , syria or iran then typhoon would be virutally unhindered . 
  it could just come in , rain pew pew and get out . 
  gripen would actually risk engagement with their migs . 
  as for rafale , there 's like 1kg of fuel or armaments that an aircraft can carry for every kg of empty weight . 
  if rafale can carry it then typhoon can carry it too . 
  gripen is my favourite on the list , but it 's nowhere near the typhoon , performance-wise . 
  that thing is like half the size of a typhoon . 
  and rafale is basically the same aircraft as the typhoon , since they started off as the same program until france decided to go all * non non , wee will make better aircraft than rosbief * . 
   also there was hardly any gay night life in any of the major capitols which made it seem like something that is `` underground '' like to be gay lolwut ? 
  there are like 6 gay bars and clubs within < 10 min walking radius from my house . 
  and i do n't even live in a `` major capitol '' . 
  i might 've bought the part where a poor gay guy from us is frightened by evil moosleems . 
  but southeuropeans ? 
  seriously ? 
  people who brought us disco music and designer jeans ? 
  and theres * no gay night life * ? 
  i do n't think you are gay , and i do n't believe you ever visited europe . 
  according to levada , [ 57 % of people who knew they would go to elections said they would vote for united russia ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2016/08/02/predstoyashhie-vybory-v-gosdumu/ ) just two months ago . 
  what makes you think they changed their minds since then ? 
  sure , why would n't they ? 
  falsifying exit polls ? 
  are you daft ? 
  anyone can run an exit poll if they please . 
  i get paid by the downvote . 
  sweet sweet shekels directly from the kgb . 
  see reply [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/53yv0y/numbers_dont_lie_statistics_point_to_massive/d7xpd2c ) . 
  there 's like a 4 % difference just between the first and the second poll that you posted . 
  for a random comparison , according to exit polls in italy in 2013 general election [ bersanis coalition won 35 % ] ( https://www.yahoo.com/news/exit-polls-center-left-tops-italian-national-vote-153708026--finance.html?ref=gs ) of the votes . 
  while after the vote count they [ got 30 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italy._common_good#cite_note-6 ) . 
  the amount of votes united russia got is still within the margin of error . 
  if there were some opposition parties earning double digits on the polls and less than 1 % after vote count then yeah , sure , there would be something to be upset about . 
  but in reality it 's just bickering about a difference of a few percent , with united russia winning parliament majority regardless of the way you count it . 
  and say * united russia committed election fraud * . 
  who should their seats go to instead ? 
  the communists ? 
  exit polls , or telephone polls , or mail surveys can all be adjusted for margin of error and aggregated . 
  if that had shown a strong deviation from the actual election results that would be a pretty strong indication of fraud . 
  instead their main issue with the results is that the * curve does n't look right * . 
  that 's a very weak argument . 
  bell curves and all , someone is yet to demonstrate that there are actually discrepancies between russian election results and exit polls . 
  not even a little bit ? 
  hate crime is basically penalising someone for being a racist cunt . 
  anyone can be one in their own free time , free speech and all , but once you actually attack someone for it then you forfeit whatever protections there are from being persecuted on a basis of your racist views . 
  in some countries they actually persecute people for inciting ethnic hatred and so on , even if no assault took place . 
  you asked * where are the stories * . 
  i spent like 5 min googling and found you the stories . 
  if you want more go on google and look for more . 
  there are plenty . 
  all of them mention systematic bullying of polish children in schools , pre and post brexit . 
  [ polish girl , 16 , found dead at school after complaints of racist bullying after moving to cornwall ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/18/polish-girl-16-found-dead-at-school-after-complaints-of-racist-b/ )  a polish teenager who was found dead at her school had complained about racist bullying on a website linked to young suicides after moving to cornwall with her family . 
  [ polish family 's plymouth home damaged in ` race hate arson attack ' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-36737529 )  ms banaszak 's sister , fourteen-year-old aleksandra abalmowicz , said : `` me and my sister were in my room . 
  we saw bright orange flames . 
  i started screaming to my mum , and dad ran outside . 
  `` it was so terrifying , i was really scared . 
  a lot of people dislike our family because i 'm polish and i 've been bullied at school . '',
