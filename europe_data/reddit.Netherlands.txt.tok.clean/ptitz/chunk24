  [ we 're not leaving the uk , this is our home ] ( http://www.huckmagazine.com/perspectives/sklep-stories-learned-brexit-afternoon-polish-deli/ )  like the rest of their extended family , bronislaw and malgorzata have raised their children to be british , without teaching them polish . 
  but that was n't enough to protect their niece from racist bullying at school . 
  days after the vote , an english classmate told her to `` fuck off to your country . '' etcetera etcetera ... 
  at least from here in the netherlands . 
  you book a flight to berlin , venice or prague for like 25e . 
  or the fact that you can pick up a plane ticket to anywhere for like 50 e these days . 
  i went in and out of switzerland a bunch of times , never saw any border patrol . 
  i mean in geneva there 's just a normal tram going between the french and the swiss side . 
  well , australia is in eurovision , which makes em european . 
  i think it 's a matter of time until new zealand joins as well ... 
  they may not hate them per se , but the gitano stereotypes are still pretty wild . 
  i mean most people gain their knowledge about them from `` palabra de gitano '' or chon gorda . 
  there are also [ irish travellers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_travellers ) , unrelated to roma . 
  and a bunch of other groups , spread across europe . 
  in my experience being stranded for 4 hours can be incredibly frustrating , but then at that point i 'd start walking to find a better spot . 
  once i was stuck like that , trying to enter switzerland . 
  then after a while i hiked on foot from the highway to mountain roads , got picked up in like 20min . 
  apparently unbeknownst to me the highway i was trying to get on was closed for works . 
  the guy just stayed in that town for 4 days , that 's pretty silly . 
  without smoke to cover it every bar just smells like piss , sweat and stale beer . 
  here in the netherlands you can still smoke in a bunch of places . 
  many bars have half of the floor space as `` designated smoking area '' , some just put out ashtrays after midnight . 
  in some clubs with laxer security you can smoke as well . 
  in germany i think also . 
  spain is actually quite a bit stricter that way . 
  they do n't even have smoking rooms at some airports . 
  yeah , and trump is investigating clinton 's corruption . 
  neither of them is particularly convincing though . 
  some of navalny investigations might hold up , but most of it is just noise . 
  he just throws everything out in the open and hopes that something sticks . 
  and he never had * anyone * actually go on record for him . 
  and even if you give him credit for challenging the system and so on , he still has this whole creepy nationalist vibe . 
  maybe not a full-blown nazi , but definitely a petty racist , and never shy to play on peoples xenophobia . 
   moscow mayor elections showed a different picture wha , navalny ? 
  he spends half of his time bitching about * lying crooked putin * and another half bitching about * illegal migrants * . 
  he 's basically donald trump . 
  i think the first problem opposition has in russia is that it lacks genuine numbers of people who actually support them , or even heard of them . 
  does n't matter how you count them . 
  tor ? 
  yeah , but in amsterdam 700 euros for a broom closet is considered a good deal . 
  in rotterdam with some luck you can find a flat for under 500 . 
  mine is like 380 and we split it with my girlfriend . 
  smack in the center and everything . 
  come to rotterdam . 
  we 've got a nice aerospace engineering faculty in delft that has bachelors in english . 
  there is also erasmus university that has a bunch of social sciences programs , i think some of them are in english too . 
  housing is relatively cheap around here and living costs are o-k , compared to some other western european places . 
  we do n't have many tourists , but there is a vibrant going out scene , concerts , festivals , and tons of expats and foreign students . 
  so finding things to do and people to hang out with should n't be a problem . 
  it 's also very well connected to the rest of europe . 
  there are cheap flights to barcelona from local airport and you could hop on a train or find blablacar and go spend a weekend in paris or berlin without much hassle . 
  there 's one like that [ here in rotterdam ] ( https://iprofessdesign.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/photo-5.jpg ) , now it 's more dark brown and it started turning green . 
  i think it 's a pretty neat effect .

  yeah , or british politicians ... 
  yeah , fantastic , several thousands stoned , drunk and armed teenagers frolicking around for a weekend . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
   the big fucking problem is that people do n't actually know what kind of immigration they do n't like . 
  i do n't think this is a problem at all . 
  because that would imply that the single most important motivation that makes people bitch about migrants was something other than plain and simple racism . 
  people just do n't like any immigrants , period . 
  he came out of luxleaks more popular than before luxleaks . 
  if that 's not the kind of thing that makes a successful politician then i do n't know what is . 
  and it 's not like luxemburg is the only country with laughably low corporate taxes . 
  or even that people were unaware of it . 
  the netherlands and ireland are doing exact same thing and in neither of these countries the public is particularly opposed to it . 
  the pressure that made these countries close some of these loopholes actually came from the eu parliament and the eu comission , led by juncker . 
  i wish people would stop saying * unelected * when referring to eu politics . 
  there is nothing junckers could do and he posesses no powers without explicit approval from the european parliament and the council of eu , that were actually put there by direct elections . 
  if anything , i do n't think it 's flattering to these very institutions that they get outshined by one guy who trolls ukip once in a while , to the point that so few people realize that these insitutions even exist . 
  perhaps if there were more people like junckers operating at the european level , besides loud-mouthed eurosceptics of various flavors , the public would be more aware of what they actually do up there . 
  at most they will be about as integral to eu political scene as norway . 
  at the least about as integral as australia . 
  they will never wield as much influence in european political scene as they used to up until now . 
   and it is getting worse ... or better . 
  there had n't been any worthy juncker memes for a while . 
  good to see the guy still delivers . 
  juncker is the europe i like . 
  enthusiastic , flamboyant and possibly tipsy . 
  merkel europe is boring , old and conservative . 
  i would imagine her terrifying greek children into submission . 
  * eat your vegetables , little giorgios , or frau merkel will come and take your toys away . 
  well , if you put it that way , crimean tatars lived in crimea for like a 1000 years before they were displaced 70 years ago . 
  friend of mine had an old bmw that fell under local `` oldtimer '' regulaions ( no road tax ) . 
  he got it for a couple of hundreds euros from someone . 
  and he was using it as his daily driver ( in the rare months that it was in running condition ) . 
  we even took it on a few road trips . 
  running out of gas on the way to hamburg ... 
  almost catching on fire in lower saxony ... engine failure 50km to basil ... 
  so many memories . 
  eventually he turned it in at the scrapyard : local government reimbursed him just to get that thing off the streets . 
  he was very sentimental about it . 
  it was falling apart , but it was a beemer . 
  his baby . 
  now he drives a polo . 
  ah , yes , the venerable erasmus student exchange program ... 
  responsible for [ 1m babies ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/eus-erasmus-study-abroad-programme-responsible-for-1m-babies-9751749.html ) across the eu . 
  i just remember from my interrailing trip across spain : you put a spaniard , a frenchman , an italian and an englishman in a room and they all end up speaking french . 
  since all the latin languages are vaguely similar , and the englishman probably learned french as the second language . 
  also i go to the north of spain often ( huesca ) , and there are probably more people who know french as their second language than english .
