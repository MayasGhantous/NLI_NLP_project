  the jsf has literally zero advantages over any eurocanard or any newer russian aircraft in flight performance department . 
  i can find you pilot testimonies claiming that their aircraft is the best shit ever about any aircraft in production right now , that does n't mean anything . 
  by the numbers the f-35 flight performance is worse than the f/a -18 , the f-16 or even mig-31 . 
  it 's just physics . 
   the f-35 was also considered to be the most effective plane . 
  based on overly optimistic pre-ioc projections by lockheed that are yet to materialize , 3 years later . 
  typhoon has all the same `` cutting edge sensors '' that the f-35 has . 
  and sensor fusion . 
  i mean shit , half of their sensors are probably made by the same company . 
  and the other half is [ more cutting edge on the typhoon and gripen than the f-35 ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/newest-us-stealth-fighter-10-years-behind-older-jets ) . 
  which sensors does the f-35 have that the typhoon does n't ? 
  or the gripen for that matter ? 
  and yeah , talking about amraams . 
  you need like 3-4 missiles to reliably take down a modern fighter at bvr . 
  and to use them effectively they have to come close enough , where they [ can be detected by the enemy airborne radars ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/f-22-wont-win-a-dogfight-thrust-vectoring-raptor-typhoon-eurofighter-2013-2?international=true&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t ) . 
   at a distance of about 50 km the typhoon irst ( infra-red search and track ) system could be capable to find even a stealthy plane in the meantime , the typhoon has meteors that have a much larger range than amraams and can also carry litening or sniper target pods while they are at it . 
  if the typhoon detects the f-35 before it enters amraam effective range , the f-35 is gone because of the typhoon superior weapons systems and superior payload . 
  if the f-35 is too close to a typhoon it 's gone because it 's not as fast or maneuverable in close range and it ca n't even outrun it once its payload is gone . 
  there 's really just one scenario for it to win : it sneaks up close enough and it does so without being detected , kind of a one-trick pony . 
  and `` harder to detect '' stealth advantage is n't quite the same as `` impossible to detect '' that they 've experienced with the f-117 going against the 50s and 60s-era radars . 
   jsf and the f-22 are protected from higher frequencies in the ku , x , c and parts of the s bands . 
  but both jets ** can be seen on enemy radars operating in the longer wavelengths like l , uhf and vhf ** . 
   in other words , russian and chinese radars can generally detect a stealth aircraft but not clearly enough to give an accurate location to a missile  but that is starting to change . 
   `` acquisition and fire control radars are starting to creep down the frequency spectrum , '' a former senior u.s. navy official told usni news on monday . 
  with improved computing power , low frequency radars are getting better and better at discerning targets more precisely . 
   `` ** i do n't see how you long survive in the world of 2020 or 2030 when dealing with these systems ** if you do n't have the lower frequency coverage , '' the former official said . 
  from [ here ] ( https://news.usni.org/2014/07/29/chinese-russian-radars-track-see-u-s-stealth ) . 
  so in the end it 's investing into an aircraft that 's supposed to remain in service for the next 30 years or so . 
  whose main gimmick will be rendered obsolete by the new generation of radar tech in just 10 . 
  and yeah , the source of my maintenance cost has always been jane 's , that specify their source as  -- military / government figures ( all aircraft )  -- disclosed international fighter competition cost figures ( rafale , f-18 e / f , gripen )  -- manufacturer stated figures ( f-35 , rafale , f-18 e / f , gripen )  -- ihs jane 's estimates ( all aircraft ) so not just the manufacturer data like you said they used . 
  they 've aggregated more fighter competition costs than just one case to come to their figure . 
  in [ maintenance hours that 's ] ( http://www.defense-aerospace.com/articles-view/feature/5/179243/navair-projects-f_35-to-need-50-maintenance-hours-per-flight-hour.html )  four years into their operational career , f-35 fighters are expected to require ** between 41.75 and 50.1 ** maintenance man-hours ( mmh ) per flight hours , ** or about three times as many as most fighter aircraft ** currently operated by western air forces . 
   ...  clearly , in fy2018 the f-35 will have only been in `` operational '' service for three or four years ( ioc in mid-2015 and mid-2016 ) , and so still a long way from maturity , but ** such a high number of maintenance hours will explode operating costs for its operators , who were long told the f-35 would be afford able to buy and to operate ** . 
  talking about the danish one , first of all whatever data they might 've had on f-35 as of 2014 can only have come from the manufacturer , as pre-ioc * projected * costs since the aircraft was n't in service for so long . 
  as years go by it becomes increasingly more obvious that the projected performance data of the f-35 and the real thing are n't quite the same . 
  and then there 's also this little tidbit in the footnote  the new fighter program has considered the manufacturers ' proposals for cooperation initiatives in accordance with current guidelines for industrial cooperation . 
  subsequently , an expert panel has assessed the initiative packages through the delphi method . 
  the combined value of the industrial cooperation proposals for the eurofighter is dkk 18.7 billion consisting of 30 initiatives . 
  the corresponding value for the joint strike fighter is dkk 26.5 billion consisting of 26 initiatives , and for the super hornet the value is dkk 15 billion consisting of 68 initiatives . 
  they were offered the most lucrative package with regard to industrial cooperation . 
  much like the case of uk , italy , turkey and the netherlands who have all participated in the program throughout its development . 
  and the same reason the french keep using their rafales . 
  and the main reason brazilians chose gripens over f/a -18 . 
  i think it 's just politics and domestic industry protectionism more than anything . 
  in eurovision = in europe, 
  in neither of these f-35 was tested against any european 4.5 gen fighters . 
  why would they perform better ? 
  because they did n't trade off anything for stealth . 
  the whole point of stealth on f-35 is to sneak past any early warning systems that the adversary might have , which only really works when the aircraft is on its way since the whole radar-scattering only really works from the front . 
  for this , they had to make a number of sacrifices . 
  to maintain stealth it has to store armament in its internal bays , severely limiting it 's payload capacity and range if you want to maintain this advantage . 
  with external loadouts whatever the stealth advantage would be severely diminished . 
  in the meantime 4.5 gen fighters generally have better speed , climb and turning rate performance and have * all the same * bells and whistles ( like the aesa radars or over-the-horizon meteor weapon systems that i mentioned in the beginning ) that the f-35 has . 
  the only supposed `` vastly superior situational awareness '' comes from its onboard software , which nobody has ever seen , so i guess we 're supposed to take their word for it . 
  so we 're left with two scenarios . 
  f-35 comes in in full stealth , shoots a couple of missiles , which may or may not hit something , and has to retreat . 
  or it comes in full external loadout , big as a barn , and it has to deal with more agile , faster aircraft . 
  either way , it 's either matched or inferior . 
  and yeah , even the * typhoon * costs like 2-3 times less in maintenance per hour flown in money and 5 times less in man-hours . 
  i ca n't imagine that the gripen is more expensive to run than the typhoon . 
  the bottom line , in my opinion , is that the f-35 stealthy gimmicks are really more suited for the offensive missions , like these perpetual middle eastern excursions that the uk likes to engage in so much . 
  that they usually drag along with the us , by the way , so the commonality might be another reason . 
  another big reason they spent so much money on it is that the whole program is like 15 % british to begin with , so they had to maintain the national industry interest . 
  all very good reasons for the united kingdom to buy a fleet of these things . 
  but i do n't see how these things would fit into any other european air force since you can have the typhoon that should stand up to anything the russians might have , or just get a budget gripen in case you are some sort of europoor . 
  and in the meantime , either of these would suffice against the assorted brown people with zero air defense capabilities that european armies are engaged against right now . 
  and can also fly more sorties since they do n't have to sit on the ground for so long between missions . 
  and why i say stealth is the gimmick that will be turned obsolete is that you can beat it already , by using data from several radar installations . 
  i 'd imagine the russians were probably working on it ever since the 80s and the chinese are probably working on it right now , so it 's only a matter of 1-2 decades before stealth becomes useless . 
  and it 's not like the f-35 has any other advantages , really . 
  we 're talking about justice systems . 
  justice system and human rights in spain or the netherlands  all of asia . 
   none of those things are democracy . 
  all of these things make the netherlands a better place to live than fucking japan . 
  and who gives a shit about iqs . 
  these people still ca n't ban kiddie porn . 
  whatever , let me re-phrase it . 
  none of the asian countries had any domestic `` rights movements '' , and whatever policies they adopted in that department were copied from the west , decades later and often under international pressure . 
  one example that i mentioned was child porn laws in japan . 
  in south korea they put you to prison for 20 years if your blood tests show that you smoked weed . 
  not even possession . 
  taiwan is still working on its transition to a democracy . 
  it also lacks any kind of double jeopardy laws , meaning that you can go back to jail over and over again until all the judges are happy . 
  all of these countries have a plethora of archaic customs and laws that most countries in the west abolished ages ago already . 
  none of these `` asian democracies '' are even close to the netherlands , where i live , or spain for this matter . 
  using them as an example of `` free , democratic states that practice death penalty '' is retarded , which was my point here . 
  and talking about democracy , putin was elected too . 
  and he also has massive support in russia , believe it or not . 
  yet his flavor of `` russian democracy '' is still shit . 
  maybe if he conformed to european democratic standards his country would n't be such a shithole . 
  i 'm not sure i can trust a rating that puts philippines where they murder suspects on sight higher than poland and pakistan above ukraine and russia . 
  with russia sharing the score with qatar , a sharia law monarchy where they still have fucking slavery . 
  `` human rights '' existed as a thing since the constitutional republics became a thing , since the abolition of the slavery and various workers rights movements , that all took place in 18th-19th centuries . 
  so yeah , quite a long time ago . 
  there were no `` actual military excercises '' that ever compared f-35 to either the typhoon , rafale , gripen or su-35 . 
  in the article they do n't even mention which aircraft they flew against , i 'm guessing [ they were recovering from the embarrassment of being beaten by the f-16s in air-to-air ] ( https://arstechnica.com/business/2015/07/disastrous-f-35-vs-f-16-face-off-was-also-a-battle-of-philosophies/ ) . 
  as for `` paper '' engagements for every american article boasting f-35 capabilities i can [ find you one that boasts the typhoon ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/f-35-could-not-dogfight-typhoon-su-35-2016-8?international=true&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t ) or any other 4.5 th gen aircraft . 
  in the end it comes down to politics and the nature of operations that it 's supposed to perform . 
  if you want operational cost comparison , [ this one ] ( https://www.stratpost.com/gripen-operational-cost-lowest-of-all-western-fighters-janes/ ) puts the f-35 at 4-7 times more expensive than the gripen . 
  even if their flyaway cost was * the same * the f-35 is still massively more expensive than the gripen .
