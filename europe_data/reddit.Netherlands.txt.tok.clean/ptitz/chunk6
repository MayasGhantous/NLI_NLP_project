  called the world atlas . 
  has lots of pictures . 
  country flags and everything . 
   civil wars are not considered wars ... til american civil war was not a war at all , just an * internal domestic conflict * . 
  i guess it 's ridiculous to assume that confederates * lost * it then , since it never was a war to begin with . 
   not considered wars under international law wait , what am i even thinking ? 
  actually before international law was defined and ic came to be there were * no wars ever * . 
  wow , what a day . 
   your knowledge is clearly lacking on the topic yeah , clearly . 
  i mean damn . 
  mind = blown . 
   there is not a military on this earth that would win in a conventional war with the us . 
  first , they said that about napoleon and look where he ended up . 
  us army is formidable , but it is definitely not invincible . 
  that would be a bit ridiculous , like comparing obama to ghengis khan or alexander the great . 
  second , if you talk about * conventional war * , that 's a very narrow definition of war , since almost * every * war is unconventional in one way or another . 
  but let 's assume for a second that you are talking about the good old war between two states . 
  like say between us and libya . 
  now what constitutes * winning * a war ? 
  war is just an extension of politics . 
  a war is won when some political gain is reached . 
  the desired political gain in case of libya was to install a friendly , democratic , pro-western government . 
  did us reach this goal ? 
  tactical - yes , strategic - not so much . 
  so its declaration of * victory * in this case is quite arguable . 
  third , like i mentioned before , * conventional wars * do n't happen very often , especially these days . 
  us does n't have a good track record with going against irregular warfare , to put it mildly . 
  and you ca n't just dismiss it either . 
  ottoman empire was brought down by irregular warfare , like many others . 
  i mean hey , if it was n't for american guerrillas going against the british , there would be no america to begin with . 
   you might not like it , but it 's the truth . 
  where did you get that impression ? 
  i 'm actually quite fond of us military . 
  it 's certainly the most impressive military force in history . 
  it 's trained , its very well equipped and it is experienced . 
  but at the moment it has more than a few issues as well . 
  it 's commanders are hardly brilliant and an army is only as good as it 's commander-in-chief , and the current one is certainly no napoleon . 
  there is a village called hell in the netherlands , there is even a kickass [ music video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-32toxpieu ) about it . 
   france was one of the principal actors you do realize its a dutch flag ? 
  so what the fuck was the spanish civil war then ? 
  or the chechnya war ? 
   only states can declare war . 
  since when ? 
  how about like every * civil war * and * insurgency * ever ? 
  well , al quaeda did declare a war on usa . 
  did usa win the war against al quaeda ? 
  well , unlike in case with drugs , al quaeda did actually go through the trouble of [ declaring a war on usa ] ( http://worldanalysis.net/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=11 ) . 
  i just find it kind of hilarious how us pretends that the war that they had been waging for past 20 years never really happened , just because they could n't win it . 
   the us won the war in a matter of days what war would that be ? 
  if i remember correctly , bush declared a * war on terror * . 
  causus belli for afghanistan invasion was the refusal of the taliban to give up al quaeda leaders , the organization that bush declared a war on . 
  and while us did take over the country in a matter of days , us ultimately failed to achieve what they came there for in the first place . 
  clausewitz defined * war * more or less as * use of engagement to compel the opponent to conform to your will * . 
  you can not just treat an engagement as an end , only as means to an end . 
  so if you declare a * war on terror ( al quaeda ) * you either win it by eradicating them or making them bend to your will , or you give up and lose it . 
  and so far * al quaeda * is the one winning , since they not only did not go anywhere , but they also spread and grew more powerful than before this war started . 
  and even if us just dropped a nuke and wiped out entire middle east , they would still basically forfeit this war , since in that case they would have given up the fighting . 
   there is no war going on in afghanistan ? 
  besides the fact that there is * still * a [ very real war going on in afghanistan ] ( http://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/june-deadliest-month-for-troops-in-afghanistan-in-9-months-1.228286 ) , al quaeda now controls [ more territory than ever ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/07/opinion/bergen-al-qaeda-terrority-gains/index.html ) . 
  right now there is a chunk about the size of uk where al quaeda has a complete and undisputed control . 
  so yes , us is in fact losing the * war on terror * . 
   but no army is because of the nature of that type of warfare well , the russians are pretty damn efficient in chechnya . 
  also spanish civil war comes to mind . 
  and the conflict in peru . 
  so no , i would n't be so categorical . 
   using the best equipment that the americans made at the time . . actually you should brush up on that . 
  israel went into suez crisis equipped with wwii-era tech . 
  and later on , when the 6-days war came , israel was equipped with ( mostly ) inferior french and belgian gear . 
  this also came at a time when israel had a very very hard time purchasing new equipment or even spare parts from france or uk , while the arabs had the newest state-of-art soviet tech shipped by the boatloads . 
  israel was really nervous toward the end of 6-days war , since israel was was literally running out of everything . 
  after the 6-days war israel established arms imports from the us , so it went into yom-kippur war with us tech . 
  but even then , i would n't call it superior to what the arabs had , since the same tech performed quite poorly against the soviet-made equipment in vietnam . 
  well , you could also read some [ financial times ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7a3c701c-f78b-11e2-87ec-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2wwyomhsb ) if you like . 
  i mean , is he a nationalist ? 
  yes , he is a nationalist . 
  is he a douchebag ? 
  thats arguable of course , but in my subjective opinion all populist nationalists are in fact douchebags . 
  how often is it mentioned when he shows up on the news ? 
  not as often as it should be . 
  could n't agree [ more ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/03/11/sorry_putin_isnt_crazy ) . 
  yeah , well , so far the us army is quite shit at winning a war with a bunch of illiterate brown people wearing towels on their heads , so there 's that . 
  also , eu already has a $ 277 billion army , thats more than russia and china combined . 
  and there are battle groups , eurocorps , eda and all these things . 
  and besides that , israel managed to win a bunch of wars against some of the largest , best-equipped armies in 20th century , so it 's clearly a question of skill/determination , not of fancy equipment . 
  ok , fair enough , i did n't mean to quote any conspiracy websites . 
  the death of tomato is something that is very real though . 
  it is one of the most tightly controlled vegetables in eu , and these days if you go buy a tomato at a supermarket , chances are it was specifically cultivated to conform to each of these regulations . 
  perfect tomato shape , perfect tomato color , perfect tomato size but tastes like fucking water . 
  i blame the eu for murdering the tomato , and you are not going to convince me otherwise . 
  i mean q&a s are nice , but i do know what tomatoes actually taste like in countries where these rules are not enforced with such rigor or do n't exist at all . 
   enforcing the legislation passed by council and parliament you see , here 's where entire dilemma comes from . 
  you say that the commission does n't make any decisions , which is not quite true , since they do . 
  they are given the authority by council and parliament to enforce these legislations however they see fit . 
  there are problems with it , if there were n't any problems then there would be no concept of * brussels bureaucrats * in smoky rooms . 
  which are n't smoky anymore , thanks to brussels bureaucrats . 
  but they would be if it was up to wilders , it 's in his program to relax the smoking rules . 
  and yes , i 'm a smoker , so thats one more reason to vote for him . 
  and yes , wilders is a big fat statist . 
  but he also calls for cutting spending on nl involvement in nato-led operations and focus on domestic security instead , another thing i ca n't disagree on . 
  eu has no future running around with captain america trying to save the world , it can defend itself just fine and it should focus on that .
