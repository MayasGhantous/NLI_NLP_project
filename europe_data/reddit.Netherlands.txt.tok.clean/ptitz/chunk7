  so there 's truth in that as well . 
  so yeah , sure people who vote nationalists these days mainly because they do n't like the foreigners . 
  but still , it 's a shame that other parties do n't pick up the cues from them sometimes . 
  and come one , somalia , that was too easy ... 
  i really wish that the western media would stop presenting [ nationalist douchebags ] ( http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2013/07/30/what-should-the-west-think-of-navalny/ ) as heralds of freedom and democracy . 
   so you 're saying the french president and uk pm did n't go to washington to pressure for us involvement ? 
  [ us was already involved in a war on libya for decades before french president and uk pm went anywhere ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_front_for_the_salvation_of_libya ) . 
  there were cia operatives on the ground in libya long before any no-fly zones were established . 
  saying that libya campaign was an * eu initiative * that us was * pressured into * is like saying that the [ invasion of czechoslovakia was a * polish initiative * that the nazis were * pressured into * ] ( http://www.weeklyuniverse.com/2003/poland.htm ) . 
  us was not * reluctant * to go to libya , us was * relieved * that they got the support from nato on this because the general public was growing tired with spending billions on sending us soldiers to various shitholes . 
  if you followed any actual military analysts with half a brain at the time of the conflict like the fp mag , the now-defunct abu muqawama or even the [ great satan `` s girlfriend ] ( http://greatsatansgirlfriend.blogspot.nl/2011/06/libyan-box.html ) instead of just taking white house bullshit rhetoric for a fact it would be bright and clear as a day to you as well . 
  i am quite perplexed at how clueless the american * public * is in their knowledge of this conflict . 
  it was actually the * very first time * i came across the conviction that us was * pressured into * participating in libya , coming from whom i assume are some average americans . 
  you would expect better from citizens of a country with the [ freest press in the world ] ( http://www.pakalertpress.com/2012/09/08/former-reporter-amber-lyon-exposes-massive-censorship-at-cnn/ ) . 
  well , why the hell not , if it makes you sleep better . 
  note how i added some nice nazi flair there . 
  and on this i [ bid adieu ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/03/11/sorry_putin_isnt_crazy ) . 
  now that russia-eu relationship is becoming increasingly awkward , us officials have something new to bitch about concerning eu role in the nato and eu states are [ lining up to buy lng from usa ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/17/usa-lng-europe-idusl2n0kr0y220140117 ) . 
  funny how these things work out , eh ? 
   you stretch facts relating to every conflict to make the us culpable . 
  jesus , is it that much of a stretch if usa fabricated an entire genocide to mandate the kosovo bombardment ? 
  and you keep insisting that libya was a eu-initiated operation . 
  cia spent [ 30 years ] ( http://www.acorn.net/jfkplace/03/test-cia/libya ) trying to kill the guy . 
  and just like in kosovo there was bullshit about * government killing their own people * all over the news , even though there was * no fucking evidence * of it whatsoever . 
  how am i stretching the facts ? 
  there is no need for it , its too easy as it is . 
  a us general wesley clark testified that [ us government was planning the whole * arab spring * as early as 2007 already ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bdbtqyo6yk ) . 
  and he 's not just some conspiracy nut on reddit , hes a fucking us general . 
  then you had these protester killings in ukraine and they turned out to be false flags as well . 
  they still did n't find the ones responsible . 
  and they are not very eager to look for them either for some reason . 
  in a couple of years there will probably be yet another round of leaks saying that cia sponsored the whole thing from start to end and no one is even going to bat an eye , mark my words . 
  and its not just me who dismisses the actions of russia here , you can listen to [ ron paul ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/03/17/crimea-ukraine-russia-ron-paul-editorials-debates/6544163/ ) if you like . 
  or is he also a us-hater ? 
   ukraine is not all that important to the us . 
  then what the fuck is us doing picking who 's going to be the next president there ? 
  why are there us politicians , diplomats and probably cia as well all over ukraine ? 
   99.99 % of the world 's problems are the fault of the us you 've read my posts wrong . 
  this had never been my opinion . 
  my opinion is that 99.99 % of us problems are the fault of us . 
  its not the fault of putin , lil kim in korea , its not iran mullahs , not jihadis in pakistan or afghanistan , nor is it due to eu * indecisiveness * and its not due to china rising . 
  no , its all us and no one else . 
  us should really get their own shirt sorted before getting involved in other countries affairs . 
  fixing the leaks in their intelligence services might be a good place to start . 
  because its already embarrassing as it is . 
  in a different country you would probably have an uprising already . 
  but us * hooray-patriots * seem to be just as clueless as their russian counter-parts . 
  its like you know , there is this joke : there can never be a revolution in america . 
  why ? 
  because there is no american embassy there . 
  and obama is not going to fix any of these problems by getting on a high horse and denouncing putin . 
  who 's only as corrupt as obama himself , but at least he 's not a fucking retard . 
  and by the way , russia has a health care system more accessible than anything us ever had and putin never spent [ $ 100 mil on a fucking vacation ] ( http://www.frontpagemag.com/2013/dgreenfield/national-lampoons-100-million-obama-africa-vacation/ ) , so theres that as well . 
  but they sure as fuck not going to broadcast that on cnn or the general public might suddenly pull their heads out of their asses for a second . 
  i am no more of an america hater than most of us conservatives . 
  you can go open any us conservative blog and you will probably find more critique of obama retarded foreign policy and more [ admiration for putin ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/02/11/the_conservative_man_crush_on_putin.html ) than you will ever read on here . 
  and if you say that this whole thing was sparked by some paper , whose benefits to common ukrainians were arguable at best , you are wrong . 
  you ca n't seriously claim that this was the case . 
  it is already quite clear that both libya and syria * peoples revolutions * [ were carried out lovingly by cia operatives ] ( http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/blackwater-veteran-took-part-gaddafi-killing-asked-us-help-syrian-opposition ) , you can just look up [ benghazi ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/10218288/cia-running-arms-smuggling-team-in-benghazi-when-consulate-was-attacked.html ) , again , thats all over us conservative media . 
  i mean its one thing to claim that 911 was an inside job , and another when there are phone records and emails and all these things just available in public domain thanks to the sorry state of us intelligence services leaking from every hole . 
  the leaked nuland phone calls and the visits of us politicians to ukraine just prove that ukraine is no different . 
  ukraine revolution is sparked by some shitty trade deals ( that would just ensure austerity and rising utility bills ) in the same manner as the revolutions in libya or syria were sparked by freedom-loving people striving for democracy and benghazi was sparked by some shitty video on youtube ( [ cheers to nuland on this one ] ( http://wizbangblog.com/2013/05/04/benghazi-whistlerblowers-emails-and-a-coverup/ ) ) . 
  eu had no interest in overthrowing the government in ukraine . 
  russia just wanted to preserve her assets in crimea . 
  and us had been pulling these stunts ever since obama took office . 
  and , by the way , you are not going to hear it on cnn , but the guys killed in crimea were probably killed by a [ right sector sniper ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/03/ukrainian-serviceman-wounded-crimea-201431815240891892.html ) , so that was probably a false flag just like the shootings in kiev . 
   there is nothing stopping the eu and russia from getting closer but russia . 
  what the hell did russia even do ? 
  us bombed kosovo , expanded nato to include eastern european and baltic states , clearly breaking all the promises made to russia , shat on russian opinion about iraq , then nato-favorite saakashvili orders troops into south osetia and stirs up a shitstorm in the media when the whole thing backfires , then us sets up a missile defense on russia 's border , leaving it vulnerable , then nato goes into libya , after spending years on working up a revolution , and sponsors subversion in syria , financing al-quaeda assets , all against russia advice ... and in the mean time you 've got a massive barrage from us politicians and us media demonizing russia . 
  and here we come down to us-endorsed * opposition leaders * overthrowing the government in ukraine . 
  mind you that the last time this happened ukraine had a re-election and russia retained her assets in crimea . 
  this time you had captain america * taking the initiative * and even when yanukovich cried uncle and agreed to re-elections , the dear * opposition leaders * made damn sure they would seize the power first , guaranteeing that russia would lose one of its few remaining naval assets abroad . 
  and now us treats russia like some sort of banana republic , threatening it with sanctions , even though it did not do anything us or nato would n't do . 
  you can say its all a conspiracy , but even countries whose entire identity is built on hating russia [ are convinced there was foul play involved ] ( http://humanrightsinvestigations.org/2014/03/05/estonia-fm-kiev-snipers-from-new-ukrainian-coalition/ ) . 
  i mean shit , nato spends 15 + years picking out russia 's allies one by one , us-sponsored ngos are snooping all over russia , sponsoring [ nationalist douchebags ] ( http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2013/07/30/what-should-the-west-think-of-navalny/ ) , portraying them as some sort of [ oppressed voices of democracy , crushed by totalitarian state ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/22/opinion/satter-alexei-navalny/index.html ) , and now this bullshit ? 
  ah , shame on eu , us officials are so upset : russia is acting up , eu should totally should spend more money on the one organization whose sole purpose was to fuck with russians for past 7 decades . 
  and fuck the arm deals that russia has with france , fuck the economic ties russia has to germany and the netherlands , fuck the fact that russia did logistics for isaf in afghanistan , that it supported the operations in somalia , that it put up with all the nato bullshit missions for two decades . 
  no , russia is the one screwing up somehow . 
  ah , if only there was a big superpower to protect the eu . 
  halp us usa , we could never deal with it without you !, 
  i 'm not even a putin fan . 
  but the current usa foreign policy course is beyond fucking retarded , for the lack of better expression . 
  if somebody told me 5 years ago : america is doomed , its economy is failing , its influence is waning , etcetera , i 'd just brush it off . 
  surely not the land of the free and the brave ? 
  but now i know , america is going down . 
  brought down not by banks , not by china but by fucking retards in charge . 
  right now it reminds me of some dysfunctional arab state preaching of zionist conspiracies to keep the populace away from thinking too much about the real problems that it faces . 
  eu has no future as part of nato . 
  last time around the chechens had their independence , the first thing that they did was to invade russia . 
  right now the russians have the situation there under control . 
  the republic is re-built and the separatist movements are flaccid at best . 
  i 'm not going to call russia * pacifist * , but they are more successful in chechnya than nato ever was in any of their freedom-bringing endeavors . 
  like i said before , if not for this whole post cold-war bullshit eu and russia would make great allies . 
  eu has more common interests with russia than they do with us , both in terms of economics and military operations . 
  and in the hindsight the russians were right about iraq , libya , syria and they are the only ones actually trying to mediate a solution with iran , so theres that as well . 
   ukraine was not committing genocide against crimeans or vise versa . 
  wha , you mean the [ genocide that never happened ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/node/138456 ) ? 
  how is kosovo gaining independence without any input from serbia any different from crimea gaining independence ? 
  mind you that russia did n't have to bomb the country into oblivion for 11 weeks for this to happen , so far not a single shot had been fired . 
  the west should really take some cues here .
