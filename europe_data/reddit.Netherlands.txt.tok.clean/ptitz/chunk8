  and yes the eu was taking its distance . 
  because us might come in all captain america to save the day , bringing * democracy * to oppressed people of ukraine ( never mind that they had like a year until the next elections anyway and that the way the whole thing went down is hardly democratic ) and then fuck off , rambling about eu * indecisiveness * or * lack of initiative * and never look back . 
  and eu is the one left to actually deal with it . 
  kind of a tradition , really . 
  and do n't tell me about * reaching out to yanukovich * , it was clear that the us had set their objectives for the outcome already while the old douchebag was still in power . 
  its quite clear who they wanted in kiev . 
   the fact that europe gets most of libya 's oil was clearly a factor in that `` world police '' adventure . 
  first : what exactly did eu stand to gain from this adventure ? 
  right now the whole supply chain is fucked up and lybia is selling crude no north korea of all places . 
  and it 's not like they would n't see it coming either , since after the whole iraq gig the most lucrative contracts ended up with russia and china . 
  second : what does libya have to do with eu * defense * ? 
  what , we are so afraid that russia will invade estonia that we bomb libya ? 
  how on earth does this justify spending more money on nato ? 
   this goes against your assertion the us was sabotaging any cooperation with the west . 
  us also invested $ 5 billion in * building democratic institutions * in ukraine , something that eu did not do . 
  us was not sabotaging the cooperation , it was fucking clueless in its foreign policy once again , who it deals with and how it goes about it . 
  which is especially evident with the most recent administration . 
  and what do you want me to back up exactly ? 
  that us was busy with subversion in ukraine ? 
  thats pretty clear already , thanks to victoria * fuck the eu * nuland . 
  do you want me to prove how clueless nato is in everything it does ? 
  one fun fact to demonstrate it is that [ al quaeda controls more territory today than it ever did ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/07/opinion/bergen-al-qaeda-terrority-gains/index.html ) . 
  i think that [ giving them money ] ( http://www.frontpagemag.com/2013/arnold-ahlert/obamas-move-to-arm-al-qaeda-in-syria/ ) certainly does n't help . 
  so the whole war on terror gig is failing miserably . 
  and meanwhile russia is being sanctioned into oblivion for something that had been [ standard nato practice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_kosovo_declaration_of_independence ) for decades and obama is [ having tea ] ( http://www.theotherrussia.org/2009/07/03/obama-will-meet-with-russian-opposition/ ) with russian * opposition leaders * , undermining the legitimacy of the whole movement . 
  what else do you want me to prove ? 
  that eu politicians are increasingly skeptical about the whole usefulness of nato ? 
  reduced defense spending testifies that . 
  if you want more specific points , you can find plenty in any eu hard-core nationalist party booklet , that 's one of the reasons people vote for them these days . 
  do you want me to prove that eu is ready to defend itself ? 
  the total military spending of the eu is $ 274 billion , thats more than china and russia combined . 
  and eu already spent 20 years building a common defense policy . 
  what 's your point ? 
  that eu needs nato ? 
  what for ? 
  it outlived itself , it is completely irrelevant , quite useless and it had been nothing but damaging ever since the end of cold war . 
  why do n't you prove me now , why does eu need nato if it has enough force , enough equipment , enough facilities and expertise to protect itself from any foreign threats already ? 
  politicians in israel are already talking about cutting its reliance on us because the whole relationship is toxic , eu should do the same . 
  nice pie chart . 
  what 's your point ? 
  is it supposed to prove something ? 
   speaks to how they feel about their european defense partners yeah , well , and what does libya have to do with eu defense ? 
  i has nothing to do with it . 
  nato is [ no longer a defense agency ] ( http://nsnbc.me/2012/05/20/natos-25th-summit-in-chicago-in-preparation-of-global-full-spectrum-dominance-interventionism-possible-preparations-for-a-regional-war-directed-against-russia-and-china-and-developments-in-global/ ) , it turned into some sort of a interest club where countries get together and decide which brown people they will bomb next . 
  it 's anachronistic and unnecessary . 
   there isnt a mechanism to manage any response . 
  there is eufor , there are eu battle groups , there is eurocorps and there is the eda . 
  eu had been integrating its capabilities since the mid-90s . 
  and as this process continues , the whole nato concept becomes increasingly irrelevant . 
  the only real threat present to eu at this moment is russia , and if it was n't for nato meddling , eu and russia would be allies by now . 
  i would sooner expect us actually starting a war with russia and european nato members being dragged into it as a consequence , rather than latvia or estonia being attacked . 
  the whole ostracizing of russia that went on for past 20 years , the us [ meddling in russia sphere of influence ] ( http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/21/88/00/00/rian_02338557.hr.en.jpg ) and the current stance that nato members take on russia only create problems where there are none and do n't provide any solutions besides * spending more money on nato * . 
  somehow russia is the * bad guy * and the * aggressor * here , while if it followed anything like the current nato doctrine you would have rogozin handing out molotov cocktails at the * occupy wall street * . 
   the agreement to spend 2 % of gdp that every nato member agreed to . 
  its non-binding . 
   when the north atlantic council unanimously decides to engage in an operation , there is no obligation for each and every country to contribute to the operation unless it is an article 5 collective defence operation , in which case expectations are different . 
  in all cases , contributions are voluntary and vary in form and scale ... 
  it is a guideline , not an obligation . 
   ask the eu countries playing world police . 
  yeah , well , and eu should leave it to us . 
  but if france and uk wish to run around playing soldiers , its their business . 
  they contribute more than 2 % of their gdp already . 
  this vision is not shared throughout the eu . 
  besides that , the us commitments to car and mali are nothing compared to what the eu coughed up for iraq or afghanistan . 
  so i do n't see what 's the problem here . 
  this is a neutral mission anyway , not bombing-the-country-into-submission kind . 
  what agreements are being broken here exactly ? 
  eu already has more than enough force to guarantee their own defense . 
  why does it also have to play world police along with us ? 
  us is scaling back on their own forces . 
  it 's their business if they wish to do so , but eu is not going invest more into nato just because us is spending less . 
   but the us is n't corrupt like russia is . 
  yeah , it [ kinda is ] ( http://www.publicintegrity.org/2011/06/15/4880/obama-rewards-big-bundlers-jobs-commissions-stimulus-money-government-contracts-and ) ... 
  yeah , i was , but no one is exactly [ eager to get into that mess ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/14/syria-no-fly-zone-white-house_n_3442955.html ) to begin with . 
  us had stepped over un before , they would do so again if they wished to . 
  and iran is not her * main * me ally , its her * only * me ally . 
  and even calling iran an ally is a stretch . 
   you called for it i did n't call for it . 
  thats my whole point , eu should not have done it , there is no point in it , it should just focus on its domestic defense and leave the world-policing to us . 
   the united states did n't even want to be involved with it that much then they shouldv ' e spoken against it . 
  but they did n't . 
  the whole thing was perpetrated by nato , 75 % us effort as you mentioned . 
  and yet the us somehow gets * dragged * into lybia , even though it voted pro-intervention . 
   yanukovich was going to sign it than pulled away at the last minute and he would be gone in a year . 
  what difference did it make that he pulled away ? 
   and `` fuck the eu '' nuland only said that because of the eu 's inaction and indecisiveness after protesters started dying [ killed by the snipers hired by the new coalition ] ( http://humanrightsinvestigations.org/2014/03/05/estonia-fm-kiev-snipers-from-new-ukrainian-coalition/ ) , the coalition that the us had been supporting . 
   draconian anti-protest laws not as draconian as anything the us has in place , and you do n't see the americans revolting . 
   fuck off with that amateur propaganda bullshit dude . 
  what propaganda ? 
  that 's what your own politicians say . 
  yeah , thanks everyone , doing a great job on this whole ukraine thing , now the evil dictator is gone so soon they will have democracy too . 
  like they do in iraq , afghanistan , egypt , lybia and all the other sunny places . 
   how does any revolution start ? 
  a spark . 
  no revolution starts without a good measure of foreign investment these days . 
  do n't be silly . 
  eu did not invest in overthrowing of a democratically elected government , us did . 
   trying to keep order in a chaotic environment so how did that work out ? 
   skip over russia 's underhanded involvement in the whole thing what involvement ? 
  russia did not even step into the game until it was already fucked up beyond any repair .
