   they instigated the revolution eu was trying to mediate a legal solution till the very end . 
   they did n't do shit when protesters were being murdered murdered by whom ? 
  is there any evidence actually pointing at the government involvement in all this ? 
   when authoritarian laws were being passed still peanuts compared to any laws active in usa or most of the eu  america , a country half-a-world away , had a more cohesive and effective foreign policy than the eu over the course of this whole thing . 
  and what did it achieve exactly ? 
  big chunk of ukraine gone ? 
  [ neo-nazis ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/06/opinion/speedie-ukraine-far-right/index.html ) in charge ? 
  great job , america , have a pat on the shoulder !, 
   for fuck 's sake , human rights abuses were going on right before your eyes in ukraine and you ai n't do shit . 
  and who was the perpetrator ? 
  what i saw was a bunch of ultra-nationalists throwing molotov cocktails at the police . 
  do you think this kind of behavior would be acceptable in eu or us ? 
  do you think they would get away with it ? 
  again , is there any evidence at all that these * human rights abuses * were actually the work of yanukovich and not the fuckheads in charge of the country right now ? 
   yulia tymoshenko , yanukovich 's only real opposition and political threat , languishing away in prison . 
   why are you so sure she was innocent ? 
   the fulda gap , the balkans , libya and mali what the hell was the point of libya intervention ? 
  what did it achieve ? 
  a secular state now turn by sectarian violence , with a bunch of islamists in charge . 
  great success that was . 
   does n't matter how it ended it does because it was a fucking disaster . 
  it was unnecessary and uncalled for and the eu should leave this kind of shit to us . 
   the whole shitstorm on your border was stirred up by a eu associated deal which you put forward and it was inflamed by reforms you demanded as a condition of it . 
  eu deal was brought forward when yushenko was still in power , and he was replaced by a democratically elected yanukovich who scrapped it . 
  and they could have voted him away and gone on with their european aspirations if they just waited for another year . 
  europe never intended there to be a revolution . 
  europe did not have anything to gain by it . 
  it was largely sponsored and perpetrated by the likes of victoria `` fuck the eu '' nuland and the us government , still is . 
   you called for it who the hell called for iraq invasion ? 
  that whole war started because of some arguments between saddam and us that the us were too distracted to address more concerned with clinton sex scandals . 
  wtf did eu stand to gain by it ? 
   see the running theme here ? 
  what , like [ spending 5 billion to bring * democracy * to a country and end up with a fascist government instead ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2fychlouxy ) ? 
   start shit in ukraine with a trade deal how does one start a revolution with a trade deal ? 
  did you see any european politicians prancing around on the stage in kiev ? 
  did you hear any phone recordings of european politicians discussing which * opposition leaders * they would prefer in power ? 
  do n't be silly . 
   which is exactly why you need to rev up your military spending there is no reason for eu to rev up anything right now . 
  much less so if it means investing more into nato . 
  did nato actually manage to accomplish anything of value , that justifies preserving it at all ? 
   ar n't so `` bullshit '' after crimea . 
  what , are you suggesting that zee russians are going to invade the eu ? 
  uk , france and italy each have more military power than russia does . 
  eu has enough deterrence as it is . 
  this whole shitstorm in ukraine was stirred up by americans anyway . 
  thanks obama , now we got a fascist state on a brink of civil war at our border !, 
   see the difference ? 
  eu allies helped with iraq and afghanistan out of solidarity , we helped with mali and libya out of necessity . 
  yeah , and each of these ( probably mali eventually ) ended in a big waste and failure . 
  whats the point in spending hundreds of billions on your military force if you ca n't achieve the political goals that you have set ? 
   it 's distracting us from our `` pivot to the pacific/asia '' . 
  we have to draw forces away from there to reassure our allies in eastern europe ( estonia , poland , etc. ), 
  and to help with interventions in mali & libya , which is n't good at all for us . 
  yeah , go for it !, 
  mind you that these guys would n't even need any reassuring if ukraine just waited until the next elections . 
  instead you send them [ this douchebag ] ( http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/21/88/00/00/rian_02338557.hr.en.jpg ) and ruin the balance in entire region . 
  i 'm not advocating isolationism or anything , but like you said , this is n't the cold war anymore . 
  eu should let the us sort out its geopolitical ambitions alone and just focus on defense at home . 
  and at the moment eu is working on precisely this , coordinating its defense efforts for domestic purposes . 
  so its only logical that they spend less on the military , since they have more than enough to protect themselves from any feasible threats . 
  if us wants to go on being all world police , its their business . 
  but they can also take some cues from that , since at the moment the us military machine is a wasteful mess . 
  russia had failed to exert any influence on any recent nato gigs . 
  no one listened to russia when they spoke against iraq war , no one listened when they spoke against libya intervention , no one gave a shit about their opinions on kosovo gaining independence . 
  which is part of the reason they do n't give a shit about western opinions on their current actions in ukraine . 
  still , today their influence is basically confined to their recent sphere of influence , the ex-ussr . 
  it does n't spread nearly as far as influence of usa or eu for that matter . 
  after all , ukraine is very much a western project and the russians could n't even prevent that from happening . 
  crimea is just a consolation prize . 
   we account for 75 % of nato 's defense spending . 
  us military is a giant inefficient money drain . 
  i do n't see it as an advantage or something that somehow gives them more weight over their eu allies . 
  americans are just terrible with their books . 
  eu went to iraq and they also went to afghanistan along with the us . 
  so whats the problem ? 
  that they still request logistics support from us ? 
  well , us requested logistic support from russia and pakistan during their gig in afghanistan , so whats your point ? 
  if us stopped wasting billions on [ bullshit projects ] ( http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2009/04/gates-rips-hear/ ) and get their [ procurement system ] ( http://www.upi.com/business_news/security-industry/2008/10/31/us-military-procurement-system-filled-with-problems/upi-36111225498004/ ) in order it could probably cut its budget in half , easily . 
  maybe then it would stop whining about yurop not contributing enough . 
  i can name more than a few ... 
  and the whole system they have in us is [ a joke ] ( http://www.publicintegrity.org/2011/06/15/4880/obama-rewards-big-bundlers-jobs-commissions-stimulus-money-government-contracts-and ) to begin with . 
  lets not even go there . 
   must be passed ( usually in heavily amended form ) by the european council and increasingly also by the european parliament . 
  and that 's far from being a mere rubber stamp : the `` oil jug ban '' is a typical example thereof . 
  but would it be the case if ukip would n't cause such a stink over it ? 
  which goes back to my original point , that we need these guys to keep the eu-wide policies in check . 
  if spain wants to pass it , its their business . 
  at least in spain you can still buy * sub-standard * tomatoes that actually taste like tomatoes , no thanks to [ european comission ] ( http://www.againstcronycapitalism.org/2013/05/european-commission-to-criminalize-nearly-all-seeds-and-plants-not-registered-with-government-not-a-joke/ ) . 
  and talking about rubber stamps and airlines in greece . 
  how about [ aegean-olympic merger ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/17/business/global/european-commission-weighs-greek-airlines-deal.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1394982004-zbtjubqdisujihxrlgcwng ) ? 
  first the commission blocks it , which gets approved . 
  then it allows it , which also gets approved . 
  how often does it happen that something that they pass * does n't get * approved ? 
  the song is pretty epic . 
  the russians are coming through the darkness of pagan centuries the russians are coming through a host of fallen enemies the russians are coming , freeing the third rome the russians are coming to the heavenly jerusalem .
