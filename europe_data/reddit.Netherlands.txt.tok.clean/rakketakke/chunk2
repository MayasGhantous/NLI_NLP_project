  fun fact : tornadoes [ do actually occur in mountains ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tornado_myths#near_rivers.2c_valleys.2c_mountains.2c_or_other_terrain_features ) and have been known to climb ridges up to 900 meters . 
  so a tornado could come down the fjord at any moment ... 
  i got this map from an eu website , here is the [ link ] ( http://horizon-magazine.eu/article/300-tornadoes-hit-europe-every-year_en.html ) . 
  there were also a few very deadly tornadoes in the history of europe according to this [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tornadoes_causing_100_or_more_deaths ) article about the most deadly tornadoes . 
  this map also includes [ watersprouts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/waterspout ) , which are usually non-supercell tornadoes over water . 
  they are usually less deadly , but when they do hit water it can be very dangerous though . 
  i also posted the same map on / r/mapporn [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1shi6u/map_of_all_the_tornado_events_in_europe_20002012/ ) , but i thought you guys would be interested as well . 
  edit : f5 tornadoes do happen in europe , there was one in 1984 in russia during a large tornado outbreak , which sadly killed a lot of people ( [ link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_ivanovo-yaroslavl_tornado_outbreak ) ) . 
  tax pressure is pretty large in the netherlands . 
  rich people buy their cars in belgium because the taxes are so much lower there . 
  but when i checked with wikipedia it always lists the netherlands above belgium so there might be something weird with the numbers . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita, 
  was the fact that people got loans to pay their houses with the cause for the insanely inflated prices ? 
  in my country , the government even gives a significant tax bonus for the part of your house you loan . 
  do you have something similar ? 
  who does n't like tulips !, 
  almost everyone knows someone who has cancer , either close family or acquaintances . 
  it 's the most powerful curse word i can think of . 
  that does n't sound like a very bad ass thing to do . 
  especially for a person who calls himself the ultimate bad ass . 
  that is true . 
  the high rise buildings still have dark roofs . 
  the greenhouses do not have dark roofs but are just a glass cover above tons and tons of lights to help the plants grow during the night . 
  i was wondering that as well . 
  here is a screenshot : http://i.imgur.com/0gsglck.jpg there is a very distinct line for some reason . 
  yup . 
  i saw richard hammond trying to get around london as fast as possible for a [ top gear episode ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckoznk4l8ky ) . 
  it was pretty damn scary to watch . 
  bicycle lanes are amazing . 
  i love cycling around without having to worry about getting killed by someone who is n't paying attention . 
  someone does n't necessarily have to join the resistance , but what he did was cooperating in an active way . 
  he might not have known what exactly the leader jorge did with the opposition , but he did n't care enough . 
  the human rights watch was all over [ what they were doing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dirty_war ) . 
  so he should have known . 
  and he should n't have cooperated the way he did . 
  supporting such evil in such a way is immoral . 
  besides , he did n't have to act that way to ` save his family ' . 
  no , he could have lived just fine . 
  but he decided to enrich himself by actively supporting this awful regime . 
  he is not a good person . 
  for maxima he is just her dad , but for the rest of the world he will be judged for his actions during that awful time . 
  the regime had a certain way of dealing with witnesses who said bad things about jorge . 
  besides that , cooperating and helping a regime like that , because it benefits you is always immoral . 
  so he might not have committed any crimes himself , but he will still be wrong . 
  her [ father ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jorge_zorreguieta ) was a minister in argentina under this awful [ guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jorge_rafael_videla ) . 
  you have good reason to be mad . 
  but you still have to go to a criminal dealer if you wanted for instance weed , right ? 
  besides that , how would they treat someone who 's bought illegal drugs or is caught using them ? 
  how did it go down hill so much in slovenia ? 
  and will there be any improvement in the future ? 
  at least it is something special . 
  the worst buildings in my opinion are not only very ugly but also extremely boring . 
  what a surprise ... 
  i wonder how many other companies are doing this as well . 
  if vw has been doing this for 6 years , it 's highly likely peugeot , skoda and other are doing the same . 
  this is indeed a very biased report ; it might very well be the case that he only uploads the interviews in which the people are saying the refugees should instead join the jihad . 
  this should definitely be higher up . 
  just for visibility : this is website is based in erbil , iraq and is a kurdish media site . 
  it says so on their about page . 
  [ other ] ( http://rudaw.net/english/analysis/07082015 ) [ articles ] ( http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/turkey/11082015 ) [ by ] ( http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/31072015 ) the same writer show a lot of similarity : almost every day he writes a article which is pro kurdish , anti turkey . 
  not saying what he writes is all lies , just warning that the articles may be coloured by a kurdish agenda . 
  it 's no effort to check for yourself , if you are also a bit wary of unknown news sites . 
  in most liquorice there is no or hardly any natrium present . 
  the [ salty taste ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salty_liquorice ) comes from ammonium chloride , which is very much an acquired taste . 
  it seems very doubtful to me that you can measure a governments performence by stock performance . 
  for one , the stock exchange subject to way too many external factors , which makes most of such assertions very doubtful . 
  secondly the stocks in all of northern europe increased dramatically during the same period . 
  how are places like poznan or wroclaw ? 
  you bring up some good points , although i do n't think the space race was mainly driven by nationalism . 
  in my opinion it was more of a military supremacy thing that allowed for so much funds to go into missiles , although planting your flag on the moon obviously did have to do with nationalism . 
  nor the american revolution , where at first the different states were n't really interested in being a very coherent group with a shared identity , but did have a shared oppressor . 
  but we 'll need a whole bunch of historians to tell the relative importance of nationalism in history . 
  the point you make about culture and nationalism is good as well and i have to agree that nationalism can also be progressive . 
  self determination for nations would also be an example of something that can be positive . 
  nationalism is not inherently bad , but can be very bad . 
  in the case of andrej duda i do n't think it is the positive side . 
  maybe wether nationalism is bad or not has to do with how a person views the nation he is proud of ( a place for poles with conservative catholic ( outdated ) values which are not very accepting of those who deviate from that definition ) . 
  could you name some examples of healthy nationalism ? 
  from what i 've read , the `` in-group love '' that is nationalism usually comes with `` out-group hate '' for the other who are lesser . 
  this is irrational behaviour , the pride , feels nice , but it comes at a price . 
  someone who is irrationally proud of something is n't going to adapt and copy a way more efficient method of doing that certain thing . 
  an example would be believing that in a certain country it is part of the culture that women should n't work . 
  that certain country will miss out on a lot of talent . 
  this is a simple example , we all know the more dramatic and negative examples . 
  of course it only starts being problematic when you take it too seriously , not when you are cheering for your country at a football game . 
  if it is something that a president stands for , it does seem he takes it too seriously . 
  seems like pretty well produced propaganda about the dutch commandos and working in the army . 
  not much depth or context , about if they 're making actual progress and what the motives of the enemy are . 
  i have to agree with you that cycling can be dangerous , especially in certain cities . 
  if you are an experienced cyclist it does get better though . 
  when i started living in amsterdam it was hard to cycle safely through all the stoned/drunk tourist ( some on bikes ) , scooters who are texting , trams and tram rails on the road , while dodging the glass and other road debris . 
  some things make it a lot easier , like cycling confidently , showing clearly what you are going to do , cycling with a few others when it gets really busy , having a well maintained bike and being very alert . 
  it 's very sad that there 's only so little cities having proper infrastructure for biking and biking is still so dangerous in many places . 
  just wondering , does germany also have a proper cyclist union ? 
  the only reason it got good in the netherlands were years of protest by the [ provo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provo_%28movement%29 ) and other parties and work by the [ fietsersbond ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fietsersbond ) . 
  anyway , safe travels . 
  the bike would also be a good alternative ; 6 km is just 20 min . 
  yes , once the bus chauffeuse did n't allow morrocans on the bus . 
  to be fair it was a group of about 8 , i was the only passenger and it was 23:00 a quiet part of nieuw-vennep . 
  it could possibly be that she would have been just as scared of some trashy white kids .
