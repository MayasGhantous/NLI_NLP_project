the proposal of this post would achieve the exact opposite for spain , france and the low countries ... 
  so you actually like dst and would like to stay on it all year ? 
  even on solar time , the clock only corresponds exactly with the day-night cycle on two days per year . 
  the concept of clock time is already a kind of time zone . 
  getting up at 6 am and having lunch at 12:00 all year round is a cultural construct , just like time zones . 
  there is nothing stopping people in spain from working 9 to 6 instead of 8 to 5 . 
  the cultural differences in those times are probably greater than those caused by daylight anyway . 
  especially now with near instant communication , remote working etc , it is really useful for a meeting at 5 pm to be at 5 pm for people in berlin as well as brest . 
  dst is unpopular one monday every year . 
  the rest of the summer , it 's pretty popular . 
  maybe the benefit is n't that great for you in sweden , where it hardly gets dark at all in summer , but where i live it makes a big difference . 
  what normal day cycles ? 
  those are determined by the movement of the earth , time zones are only very distantly related to them . 
  the purpose of time zones is to to facilitate different groups of people doing things at the same time . 
  we created time zones for our convenience , not for political reasons . 
  if daylight saving time is convenient for us , we can totally do it . 
  if a natural day cycle is what you want , then you 'll have to get used to the idea that in a town a few miles to the west , noon is a few minutes later than in your town . 
  unless you stay in one place all the time , clocks become largely useless this way , and you 'd quickly resort to something like utc to make appointments . 
  netherlands is germany 's belgium . 
  leaving the eu will not change anything about the eu being blamed for everything that goes pear shaped . 
  it 's your face to the world , together with the sun . 
  i know the british media has much better papers and websites , but those do n't attract international attention . 
  with foreign publications , one does n't know which are quality and which are trash . 
  for conservative leaning people across the ocean , links to the sun and the mail validate their views on europe . 
  it 's british , so by default it 's quality and classy in their eyes . 
  because hardly anyone outside europe reads french or german publications , most of the world views europe filtered through the eyes of the british press . 
  do n't overestimate the average voter in the rest of europe though . 
  it 's not like every voter in germany or netherlands is making a fully informed decision . 
  some cultures , for some reason just idolize this idea of a `` strong man '' as a leader , while others do n't . 
  turkey is hardly alone in this . 
  here we prefer weak bureaucratic leaders and a strong parliament . 
  i do n't trust leaders that get too popular . 
  parking in the city is atrocious . 
  there 's not much of a field or water , and you ca n't very well leave it tied to a post for 9 hours a day . 
  not to mention the horse thieves that are rampant in the city . 
  a bike is easily the most comfortable ( and during rush hour the fastest ) mode of transport on any distance up to maybe 10 to 15 kilometer . 
  why pay off debt when the interest rate is effectively less than zero ? 
  no , we should spend this on booze and women . 
  finally , free money !, 
  ok , i do n't want for much , i 'm only asking for 3 little things . 
  i want a ferrari cake , i want to work 4 days a week , i want a nice mansion by the coast with indoor gym and room for a horse or two , but at cycling distance from work . 
  because they think liberals ( `` lefties '' ) love it . 
  also , if they think about europe at all , they like europe about as well as the average `` lefty '' here likes the us , meaning : not very much . 
  actually , no . 
  adjusted for inflation , the 1957 population is almost 370 million in 2017 europeans . 
  the dutch media has had wilders as the center point since 2005 . 
  he knows how to troll the media , and unlike all of his opponents he is absolutely shameless about it . 
  every other week , he says or does something outrageous . 
  an ` almost ' racist tweet here , some slander there , a photoshop hatchet job , provoking a trial , whatever it takes to get his face on the front page of the papers again without having to pay a cent for it . 
  it works , it 's far cheaper than traditional campaigning , it allows him to influence policy on a shoestring budget . 
  rule # 1 of the internet : do n't read the comments . 
  the only exception i made are sites where the comments are the content , such as this site . 
  it was cancelled because pumping a 4 meter deep pit in the water table has consequences . 
  the reduced pressure of the water makes ground water flow into the area from surrounding areas , causing these areas to dry out and sink . 
  the surrounding area in the case of the markerwaard would be amsterdam , the most important city in the world . 
  to me anyway . 
  the wooden piles that the old center is built on would be exposed and rot . 
  the ground would compact , unevenly , and cause buildings to crack . 
  in effect , finishing the markerwaard would mean sacrificing amsterdam in exchange for some new shitty farm land , which was n't really needed all that badly anymore . 
  before someone from groningen remarks `` hey , is n't that exactly what you all have been doing to us ? '', 
  - yes it is , and i do n't find that acceptable either . 
  that 's by design . 
  both men try to make these elections a race between pvv and vvd . 
  if the electorate falls for this , and votes are sucked away from the other parties , we 'll simply end up with a vvd/pvv coalition . 
  it looks like an apple tree ? 
  looking outside , i get a feeling of climate envy . 
  here , we have four distinct seasons : early fall , fall , late fall and very early fall . 
  pope john paul the second !, 
  oh come on , we have so much more to offer : ** jan roos ** : a younger , less sophisticated steve bannon . 
  he just wants to see the world burn . 
  trolling , to him , is not just an art form , it is a calling . 
  ** thierry baudet ** : he wears his title of putin 's most useful idiot with pride , and is looking for an encore . 
  organized the ukraine referendum fiasco with jan roos . 
  unlike roos , he actually has political ideals . 
  well , just one : being annexed by russia , with vladimir putin as god-emperor of the world and baudet as his concubine . 
  ** jan nagel ** : wants to approach politics like a business : `` does n't matter if it 's good , it just has to sell '' ** henk krol ** : jan nagel 's hired captain on his latest flagship , the senior citizen 's party . 
  a confabulation artist , convinces himself that senior citizens in the netherlands are the poorest and hardest screwed people in the history of mankind . 
  once convicted for having robbed the pension fund of his employees , he bears the distinction of being a bigger piece of shit than wilders . 
  ** kuzu / \u00d6zt\u00fcrk ** : they seem a little confused , thinking mr. erdogan is the president of the netherlands . 
  ** rita verdonk ** : former prison warden . 
  a little confused , would love to run the country like a prison . 
  ** marianne thieme ** : https://www.jacktummers.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/marianne-thieme-20120918-4.jpg ** kees van der staaij ** : would like the constitution to be replaced by the bible . 
  the old testament , presumably , not that modern , new fangled stuff . 
  did i forget any ? 
  it largely reflects the time when the sun , not fossil fuel , was the basis of the economy . 
  such a time may come again in the not too distant future . 
  what does being more or less right wing have to do with it ? 
  a serious question . 
  just counting islamic terrorism , the fis attacks in paris in 1995 happened under a right wing government , the 9/11 attacks happened under a right wing government , the 2005 attacks in london under a labour government , the november 2015 attacks in paris under a socialist government , this attack in berlin under a center right government . 
  i do n't think it makes a difference . 
  right wing or left wing politics basically just influence domestic / economic policy , how the government treats you , not how the government treats terrorists . 
  right wing / conservative politicians like to claim they have a monopoly on toughness , but the link is not really there in practice , and neither is the link between `` toughness '' and safety . 
  erdogan and putin are both right wing , tough as nails ( or at least they like people to think they are ) , but suffer islamic terror attacks frequently . 
  it 's clearly the chickens who are to blame, 
  what i know about spain is that everyone seems to like spain . 
  it 's a country that has its public relations in order, 
  it 's a protest vote , really , to shake things up in the capital . 
  they think they 're so very clever there in the city , do they now ? 
  i remember that poll . 
  iirc , geert wilders narrowly won it , but then the show magically found some extra votes for willem van oranje which prevented embarrassment .
