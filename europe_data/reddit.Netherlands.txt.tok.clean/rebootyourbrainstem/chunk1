wow , that 's really sad . 
  hope it works out for him : /, 
  in unrelated news , latvian relations with russia become more strained . 
  still does n't explain how ambitious people who migrate to find work are somehow `` expensive '' . 
  they pay taxes like everyone else . 
  it sounds to me like he 's just scaremongering instead of addressing an actual misunderstanding . 
  `` you 're right that our previous scaremongering might not hold up ... but have you considered that * in the future * we might have a point ? 
  we do n't , so do n't think to deeply about it , but ... '', 
  the portuguese ministry of defense appears to be claiming an airspace violation : https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.emgfa.pt%2fpt%2fcomunicados%2f2014-15&amp;edit-text= anyway , `` on the edges '' does not have to mean they did n't stray into national airspace , it can also means they did n't go very deep . 
  this should provide a good starting point for learning more , if you are interested . 
  floating vodka bottle with a note inside ? 
  as long as you remember that the ration was 20 last week . 
  remembering it as 30 is flat out incorrect thoughtcrime . 
  the us is in decline , i 'll grant you that . 
  but it 's not yet clear which way europe will go . 
  the loose association between the states was only really tenable because we had the various us-led groups to impart direction and guidance . 
  i think we 'll see more unification within europe on foreign policy and defence , as it is forced to deal with a more aggressive russia while the us is busy elsewhere and / or succumbing to a severely dysfunctional national political arena . 
   for instance germany - for all intents and purposes - should n't be a part of the `` west '' . 
  it 's geographical location means it really should strive to be a middle player between russia and the us . 
  you pretty much have to be a russian for that statement to make any sense at all . 
  europe is not here to be your buffer / client states , sorry . 
  pushing fossil fuels will speed up climate change , which is likely to cause crisis in europe and the us , but will open up the arctic to russian shipping . 
  so in a way they are investing in their future . 
  ( yes , i 'm kidding . 
  but only mostly . ), 
  i think you are buying too much into the russian propaganda . 
  the insurrections are fueled by some local crazies and tons of russian military leadership and special forces . 
  whatever their politics , most people there just want to get on with their lives . 
  i realize it 's easy to let russia have some parts of ukraine , but we should not be seduced into that kind of laxness . 
  there are clear boundaries to what is acceptable , and russia is shitting all over them . 
  if we let them get away with that we are letting them define what is now `` acceptable '' , since we clearly do n't know anymore . 
  actually the cheaper option by far would be to reinforce ukraine economically and militarily . 
  it also has the advantage of speaking to russia in their own language . 
  in fact the propaganda worked so well that the passengers of mh17 were convinced to fall out of the sky even though there was in fact no russian anti-aircraft system being operated by rebels led by a russian army colonel . 
  also strategic locations in crimea were not secured by russian special forces , the battle plans , organisation and heavy weaponry spontaneously materialised when a bunch of ethnic russians with ak-47 's suddenly realised that crimea had always been russian territory . 
  also , it is complete coincidence that putin is holding large scale wargames just across the ukranian border and is moving various army divisions west . 
  this is by no means intimidation or a prelude to invasion . 
  `` civilising russia though trade '' is chauvinism and hubris of the highest order . 
  continue denying cultural , political and economic inertia all you want , but russia is not going to be a shining beacon of democracy tomorrow . 
  not when many russians still pine for the glory days of the ussr , and the country is for all intents and purposes owned by gangsters . 
  the last time the netherlands stood up to a russian cock-up they literally tied up one of our diplomats in his residence and [ beat the shit out of him ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24545441 ) . 
  honestly `` complicated '' does n't begin to describe netherlands/russian relations [ at this point ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/05/dutch-king-russia-netherlands-friendship ) , i think . 
  ca n't blame our ( netherlands ) government for trying to keep things from blowing up in the media this time . 
  anything inconvenient . 
  the eu currently makes an excellent scapegoat for all kinds of things that they will still have to deal with after an eu exit . 
  so who will they blame then ? 
  too bad actually leaving the eu does n't fit with the goals of your politicians . 
  they 'd have to go back to blaming foreigners for everything even in polite company , and that 's so last century . 
  he 's usually not in the media for `` most of his stuff '' . 
  he makes headlines with his ridiculous muslim-bashing bullshit , so he gets labelled far-right . 
  also crappy old reserve bike for when/if your main one breaks or gets stolen . 
  ehh , would still be a more normal look than the eurovision 2006 winners . 
  the article mentions that there is/was little support for economic sanctions in germany . 
  do you see any chance of that changing ? 
  relevant post from / r/netherlands , with `` our '' favorite accounting : http://imgur.com/ijcin8r , 
  speaking only for the netherlands ( i do n't know about the others ) , our current defence minister 's task is mostly to impose more budget cuts on an already modestly funded military . 
  i would expect her to defer to senior staff for advice on operational decisions , and i do n't expect our military to start any significant undertakings under her . 
  by the way , i do not agree with this , or the overall strategy of cutting expenses to the bone for that matter . 
  appropriate username . 
  the plumbing is n't able to deal with toilet paper . 
  i 've heard it explained as the pipes not being calculated to deal with very powerful flushing , which is required to prevent the accumulation of toilet paper on the sides of the pipes , but do n't know for sure . 
  maybe some parts of their sewer system do n't get much flow for a large part of the year ? 
  anyway , they have little trash cans next to every toilet for the toilet paper . 
  it 's polite to fold the dirty side of the paper shut , but often people do n't . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korfball not sure how `` professional '' the teams are though ( as in , if and how much players get paid ) . 
  wonder if they have someone on staff who can translate classical / church latin . 
  pretty much all the cost for phone providers is in their local base station network and the licenses required to operate it . 
  transferring a piddly little audio stream from one country to another just does n't come close in terms of cost . 
  i do n't understand why an international call should cost any more than a local call in this age . 
  good : beautiful country , good food , historic , very big in commercial shipping . 
  bad : big divide between rich/poor , corrupt politicians do n't know how to stop selling out their citizens , golden dawn fascists . 
  [ yes , but what have the romans done for us * recently * ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exwfh6sgyso ), 
  sort of , but we were never in it for the military power . 
  for the netherlands it was always about commerce . 
  our old trade network is more of a source of pride , which is somewhat tempered by the fact that we also traded slaves and did some pretty reprehensible things in our colonies when they decided they did n't want to be colonies anymore . 
  when our old prime minister said something about reviving the entrepreneurial `` voc mentality '' ( voc = dutch east india company , the main component of our trade network at the time ) he got a couple of semi-embarrassed coughs . 
  you also produce some fine booze ( beers & whiskeys ) , and i hear the cider is pretty good but i 've never been into that . 
  i know , right ? 
  dutchie here , and i am very disappointed by our ranking in this survey . 
  ^ ^ ^ what ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ mean ^ ^ ^ `` it 's ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ competition '' ? 
   challenged / objected ( i 'm not sure how is this procedure called in `` law english '' ) his 5 years sentence i think `` appealed '' , which means asking a higher court to consider the case . 
  challenged is fine though . 
  i was on holiday in ireland and also visited belfast . 
  was ( naively , perhaps ) surprised to hear that this conflict is very much still serious business , and we very nearly picked a `` bad time '' to visit ( the marches ) . 
  extremely educational however , and really made me appreciate a bit more what it must be like to live in a conflict zone . 
  for anyone thinking of visiting ireland , your visit really is n't complete without absorbing some of this history . 
  hey , normandy is pretty popular with some tourists . 
  i remember at one point they were basically storming the beaches ... 
  so courageous, 
  they could add key activist phrases and concepts as subliminal messages and then round up anyone who shows a positive neural response . 
  basically , a completely subconscious polygraph examination that can be inserted into your entertainment at any time . 
  big brother was an underachieving slacker !, 
  so many programs and systems are broken and insecure . 
  with laws like these , the people who find those problems will be criminals and foreigners . 
  good job , legislators !, 
  you really saved us . 
  is be called spudnik . 
  i do n't think so . 
  they have strategic depth , and a population and corporate community that still remembers how to shut up and buckle down when the government tells it to .
