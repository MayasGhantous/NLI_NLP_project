  not so different from a passport . 
  what has the eu done for me so far that we needed the eu for to get done ? 
   i am absolutely convinced that dutch society as a whole contains racist elements , it 's just that some people are more adept at hiding their sentiments . 
  can you name some of those racist elements in dutch society ** as a whole ** ? 
   we must not hide behind our legal institutions in order to rising tensions , . . on a scale of 0 to 10 , to how high have those tensions risen , do you think ? 
   that will be the function of the coming `` fake news '' expurgation campaign -- not to instate any kind of objective measures of determining what is `` fake '' news and what is `` real , '' but mandating conformity , and punishing those who defy conformist standards . 
  there strictly is no objective way of determining what is fake news . 
  even if you have multiple sources , there is no way to determine that they are truly independent and not part of some conspiracy . 
  we send journalists to observe things events in our place and we can only trust them to tell the truth . 
  and you may look for `` reputable '' news sources but they are ironically the ones that can get away with telling the biggest lies simply because they are trusted . 
  my worry is that this combination of the wilful spreading of fake news and public discrediting of the `` establishment '' will break the world . 
  it is at worst a campaign of pure disruption and at best an excuse for political opportunists to start an authoritarian personality cult . 
  what about that [ polish woman arrested on the croatian border carrying radium-226 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/52t4x5/polish_woman_arrested_on_croatian_border_carrying/ ) ? 
  is there any news about that ? 
  maybe he flew too close to the sun . 
  two monsters fought each other and one of them won and ate half of europe . 
  off the top of my head : greed , jealousy , revenge , pleasure , getting rid of witnesses , getting rid of political opposition . 
  not that inconceivable to westerners . 
  i suppose the rats will be expected to eat the birds ? 
  and the cats will eat the rats ? 
  but then who will eat the cats ? 
   at least it 'll look gorgeous plants and trees do attract insect and birds . 
  birds tend to shit all over the place given half a chance . 
  insects can be a whole different kind of nuisance . 
  from a distance it will still look gorgeous , i guess . 
  weakness and strength are both the result of specialization . 
  what is weakness or strength depends on circumstances . 
  it is wise to remain flexible and able to adapt to changing circumstances . 
  so the wise are strong and assholes are weak ? 
  that 's how it works , right ? 
  you could get rid of lead-acid batteries and drain cleaners . 
  i need a little more than a sample size of 1 to form any conclusions . . 
  i 'd never heard of him . 
  yes , they are delicious . 
  i prefer the red ones , love to eat them raw . 
  they contain lots of vitamin c. 
   the word for bone and the word for leg is the same . 
  technically correct but i think the word `` bot '' is more often used than `` been '' for `` bone '' . 
  how many of those who were arrested were eventually let go ? 
  have you read [ the wikipedia page on the subject ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brexit ) ? 
   what 's the last one about ? 
  google `` reality winner '' . 
  i does seem a bit below the belt . 
  the english do n't live near the levant though . 
  they made extra effort to get there . 
   this is a fail of czech goverment am i missing something ? 
  how is the czech goverment involved in this ? 
  putin seems oddly unconcerned about this . 
  is hacking not illegal in russia ? 
  what if those hackers cause some kind of international incident ? 
  could this not damage russia 's reputation ? 
  how do they test for whiteness ? 
  do they use a [ brown paper bag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brown_paper_bag_test ) ? 
  or maybe a [ pencil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pencil_test_ ( south_africa \\ ) ) ? 
  how about a [ blood test ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/one-drop_rule ) ? 
   saint nicholas and his . . uhh . . assistant ? 
  `` knecht '' can be translated a few different ways `` servant '' seems a fairly generic translation . 
   being a politician should be about virtue but it 's instead about your lying skill . 
  are you saying the democratic process makes good politicians lie ? 
   nurturing a ruling class of aristoi ( the best ) based on intellectual meritocracy . 
  do n't we already do that in a representative democracy ? 
  there 's no agreement over what is best anyway . 
   in this sense `` democracy '' is pretending everyone is an aristoi ( because of the egalitarian dogma ) . 
  in the case of a pure democracy , sure . 
  pure democracies are generally considered impractical though . 
   i think my underlying point is that the `` will '' of a people can not be expressed as a popular vote so what alternate method of deciding the `` will '' of the people do you suggest ? 
  and then what ? 
   love of the people is the aristocrat 's vocation . 
  love of the elite is the aristocrat 's vocation . 
   the democrat does not love the people except during election season . '', 
  which is why that particular democrat will not be getting any votes next election . 
   popular consent is an index of legitimacy , but not a cause . 
  it 's not supposed to be a cause . 
  the proof of the pudding is always in the eating . 
   power is legitimate if it fulfills the mandate which the vital and ethical necessities ** of a society ** confer on it . '', 
  that sounds awfully democratic . 
  keep in mind that `` a society '' is not a monolithic entity . 
  `` a society '' is not just the elite in a country . 
  turning and turning in the widening gyre the falcon can not hear the falconer ; things fall apart ; the centre can not hold ; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world , the blood-dimmed tide is loosed , and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned ; the best lack all conviction , while the worst are full of passionate intensity . 
  - from the second coming by w.b. 
  i disagree but i 've seen conservatives quote this sometimes . 
  will this not lower the wages of non-eu workers and raise the price of products ? 
   we committed genocide on a few islands in indonesia . 
  not as a result of any liberal ideology though . 
   you can similarly point to liberal countries that suffered mass starvations , committed genocides and imprisoned / murdered political opposition . 
  which countries do you mean ? 
  this seems a little passive aggresive . 
  how am i supposed to read these numbers ? 
  is 0.357 a high value or a low one ? 
  is the highest possible value 1 ? 
  ah , the pitfalls of a culturally heterogeneous society . 
   did something change ? 
  china gave up vanilla communism and went partly capitalistic . 
  they got good at industrialization . 
  japan got good at it long before them . 
  the ussr collapsed and became a capitalistic oligarchy . 
  europe is , hopefully still , in the process of becoming a larger economic superpower than the usa ever was . 
  economically a lot has change since , let 's say , the reagan era . 
  the internet has opened up the usa to all sorts of direct foreign cultural influences . 
  not so much the other way round .
