  social networks have replaced tv and radio to a large extent and the dissemination of information is much less centralized . 
  countries like china , russia , turkey and others have recognized this as a disrupting factor within their own territories . 
  in order to dominate you must isolate and purify . 
  the usa , so far , refuse to do this as it goes against their cultural ideals . 
  the thing is , in places like the usa and europe , which are liberal democracies , a lot of people know that they are fairly well educated , well informed . 
  they think they can be politicians but they 're only partly right about that . 
  because , if they were to become politicians , they 'd still be amateurs . 
  and that 's where donald trump comes in because he 's one of them , one of the amateurs . 
  if i 'm optimistic then i have to say that if there is a crisis that the west is going through then it 's a crisis that is partly circumstantial but also partly the consequence of a kind of cultural adolescence . 
  holding on to our cultural ideals may lead to overall greater self-reliance but also greater cultural complexity as social networks fragment and specialize and reintegrate . 
  but that may depend on circumstantial factors . 
   though even then the fact that this one poll was so wildly different from every single survey taken in the country is certainly suspicious enough on it 's own . 
  did n't most polls in the usa predict that donald trump would not be president ? 
   it could be speculated that young gay men `` have an easier time accepting their sexuality if they do it in exchange for something , like a few beers or a recharge of their phone card . '' why speculate ? 
  why not just ask them ? 
   first european on the moon will be russian . 
  to do what ? 
  i think the question is what the vvd got in return for that . 
   also , how is this relevant to this subreddit in any way ? 
  decebalus is probably just a troll who wants to see `` lefties '' come to the defence of `` radical muslims '' .

  this is why i like statically typed functional languages , 
  if i look at this from a programmers ' perspective , global variables tend to be seen as dangerous because changing their values can have unforeseen effects throughout the system . 
  which is why local variables that imply a form of compartimentalization are preferred and the use of global variables is minimized . 
  however , from a political/economic perspective compartimentalization makes life harder for multinational companies . 
  well , my question was supposed to lead into a critical examination of your cultural and moral relativism . 
  if morality has a function then it has an effect that may be objectively measured . 
   first they were seen as foreign to the american nation when was that ? 
   is seen as core parts of american culture as a whole . 
  so what parts of american culture have been changed and how ? 
  so what is the function of morality ? 
   i think that both get altered , especially after the new becomes part of the whole do you have evidence of this happening ? 
   you are sooo deeply in denial . 
  simply telling people who are in denial that they are in denial is n't going to make them any less in denial . 
   just deal with it . 
  how do you suggest 7500 do this ? 
   who the fuck attacks a medic ? 
  as the article states , drunk people , ignorant but desperate people . 
  the article does n't say it but if medics help an assault victim and the assaulter is present then they are sometimes attacked as well . 
  [ this article explains it a bit ] ( http://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sevendays.nl%2fartikel%2f171736&amp;act=url ) . 
   of those , more than 40 percent are no longer receiving aid from the city , either because they landed a new job ( around 600 ) , gave up on claiming benefits or simply had the benefits withdrawn . 
  so 19 % found a job . 
  what happened to the 2500 other people ? 
   if this was unclear to you , i 'm glad it is no longer . 
  my remark about competence and responsibility still stands though . 
   forcing someone to find their own partner when they would like their parents to ( help them ) do so , is equally bad as forcing someone to marry someone they do n't want . 
  i do n't think it 's exactly equally wrong . 
  i do think that not allowing someone to ask for help in finding a partner is a restriction of his/her freedom . 
  if the eventual decision to get married to this person is yours than i would say the matter of arranged marriages is n't even under deliberation . 
  letting your parents help you find a potential partner is no different than letting some dating agency find you one . 
  having a dating agency/parents choose your marriage partner for you is something entirely different . 
   arranged marriages ask more of your faith in your parents and less of your faith in you then this is also about ( a lack of ) perceived competence and deferring responsibility . 
   there 's a difference between arranged marriage and forced marriage . 
  what i do n't understand is why any selfrespecting individuals would want others to tell them who to marry . 
   federations gain a certain amount of clout on the international stage . 
  that may very well be the case but that does n't answer my question about why to bother with intra-federal competition ( which seems to me the subject of the speech from the video ) . 
  between member states ? 
  to some degree , but if taxes are eventually redistributed to the losing states , why bother ? 
   because competition would spur on the states . 
  who says it would n't ? 
  the only reason the states do n't fragment is because they foster this mythology of freedom and the threat of being overpowered either economically or militarily by larger countries . 
  [ join , or die ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/join,_or_die ) then again china seems to be doing quite well these days . 
  then again , never stick your dick in crazy . 
  any directly elected president is going to claim to represent the will of the people and over time draw more and more power to that office for that reason . 
  elections will tend to focus on the presidential election rather than the parlementary elections . 
  that does n't make me happy . 
   i 'm not looking at it as a solution to the current crisis . 
  neither was i , specifically . 
  i was thinking about the issues mentioned in the video . 
   europe as being more competitive [ ... ] with a much tighter union between current countries . 
  tighter in what way ? 
  why ? 
  specific issues can be addressed via specific treaties , ca n't they ? 
  or hire a security guard who watches the video feeds . 
  or install a device that simply detects movement at the track area . 
  then what 's the point of visibility if nobody 's watching ? 
  i was n't talking about the medias ' attention but about the amount of attention citizens can spend following political news . 
   most of all visible to the public that would most likely take attention way from national politics . 
  have greek religious leaders responded to these events ? 
   knobloch wrote that circumcision was at the core of jewish identity . 
  wow , that 's right out of some absurdist comedy . 
  religions continue to satirize themselves . 
   iran used to be a cool place . 
  i do n't know about `` cool '' but [ it still has nice parts ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d61uriegsim ) . 
  i think the pvda started leaning a bit too far to the socio-economic right , maybe because they were still unsure of their own identity or maybe just for political reasons . 
  well , diversity of stereotypes . 
  damn liberal newspapers appeasing religious extremists ...  `` circumcisions that are carried out responsibly must be possible in this country without punishment . '', 
  also those performed on little baby girls ? 
  because their intersection is nationalism ? 
   `` intimidated the children and pushed pork sausages down their throats '' . 
  that 's not an accurate translation of what the [ original article ] ( http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/5036/wetstraat/article/detail/1453824/2012/06/14/vlaams-belangers-intimideren-kinderen-op-halal-barbecue.dhtml ) in dutch said . 
  a more accurate translation would be : '' [ they ] * practically * pushed pork sausages down their throats . '', 
  not that i 'm defending any of what these guys did . 
  stupid . 
  even americans themselves do n't trust their government to stay out of their computers so why should we ?
