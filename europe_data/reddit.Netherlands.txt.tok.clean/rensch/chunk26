  there are issues , though . 
  many lgbt couples are afraid to walk hand in hand . 
  there has been an increase in hate crimes , too . 
  especially among muslim and othodox protestants the topic is still mostly taboo . 
  we also did n't have any delta works . 
  most people are not religiously affiliated here , atheism is no big deal here . 
  do n't forget one the biggest ones : `` 9/11 was an inside job '' . 
  according to the almere local branch of geert wilders ' right-wing freedom party , global warming is an unscientific hoax made up by the left to levy taxes from hard-working people . 
  yeah , the familiar tale . 
  the top one is basically the plot of a star trek episode . 
  in it , the enterprise crew find apollo on some planet , who is actually an alien who visited earth centuries ago . 
  glorious socialist people 's super market really looks like shit . 
  not right now at least . 
  there are things better left to the nation states and things that require a supranational approach . 
  it really depends . 
  parties in house of commons : - * labour * : ( social democrats/socialists ) mainstream centre-left party . 
  - * conservatives * : ( conservative , mostly on economic issues ) mainstream centre-right party . 
  - * liberal democrats * : ( liberal , centrist ) in between the previous two . 
  often used as a coalition partner , like with the current government , to help one of the two major parties get a majority in the event of a ` hung parliament ' ( which means no party has a majority ) . 
  - * scottish national party * : ( scottish nationalists , left-wing ) a bit more left-wing than labour . 
  also pro-independence for scotland . 
  - * plaid cymru * : ( welsh nationalists , left-wing ) same as snp but for scotland . 
  - * greens * : ( environmentalists , left-wing ) there are three green branches forming one common green political family : one for england and wales , one for scotland and a nortern irish one . 
  these basically act as one parliamentary group if two or all three of them get mps elected . 
  - * uk independence party * : ( anti-eu , far-right populists ) anti-eu membership party . 
  wants a referendum on eu membership and more limits on immigration . 
  - * democratic unionist party * : ( nortern irish unionists , centre right ) want to keep nortern ireland in the uk . 
  - * sinn fein * : ( nortern irish republicans , left-wing ) want northern ireland to become a part of ireland . 
  - * social democratic and labour party * : ( northern irish social democrats , centre-left ) nortern irish sister party of labour . 
  typically both parties act as one voice in parliament . 
  - * alliance party * : ( northern irish liberals , centrist ) northern irish sister party to the liberal democrats . 
  the two usually act as one voice in parliament much like the social democrats do . 
  - * respect party * : ( ultra-left ) far-left party with one seat held by controversial politician george galloway . 
  it would be even more bizarre if they can prove he was guilty of rape . 
  from what little i knew about him , he seemed a very likeable guy . 
  a man of the people , a rarity for social democrats these days it seems . 
  they should put their taxpayer money in more important tasks ... like determining once and for all wether or not han shot first . 
  ( not that i doubt for a second that that 's the case , but still ... ), 
  seriously though , i have thousands of euros of student debt . 
  you guys get your education for free so you have money left for a cool hat and a sword . 
  finnish privilege !, 
  in countries with proportional representation , parties usually make a selection of people from all over ( if possible ) . 
  something like that could also be done eu-wide . 
  but yeah , someone from germany or england would be more recognizable than a person from slovenia , regardeless of personal qualities . 
  ok thanks for clearing that up . 
  i see . 
  so what about nicola sturgeon ? 
  does this mean you germans finally get to play wolfenstein 3d in all its pixelated vga glory ? 
  you get a top hat and a sword ? 
  now i get why they invest so much in education . 
  why is alex salmond still in this ? 
  i assume this from last year . 
  i 'd at least like the parliament to have the ability to put forward its own proposals or amendments . 
  there should also be a proportional eu-wide election system . 
  they should have eu-wide party lists . 
  what if i like a politician from spain or sweden better than any dutch candidate . 
  i should be able to vote for them . 
  after all , they also have influence on me and any other eu citizen . 
  this is excellent news . 
  the amount of shows on the dutch netflix is utter shit . 
  i use hola unblocker regularly . 
  latvia perhaps . 
  i hear they share our fondness of potatoes . 
  frikandel out of the automat . 
  a lot of american millenials prefer jon stewart as a news source . 
  since this show is from the same genre it is n't that weird , just really sad . 
  polls say so . 
  but i think people like the royal family rather than the actual institution of a monarchy . 
  it 's mostly younger demographics that do n't like the monarchy and even then it does n't mean they necessarily think a republic would be better . 
  i see this kind of stuff here all the time . 
  by the way , someone already did . 
  let 's just wait and see if this falls under the exeptitions before we draw conclusions . 
  i think it 's probably a mixture of both . 
  i personally feel we should keep zwarte piet , but let him be just another colour in a whole palette of pieten . 
  that way , you strip piet 's colour of its racial conotations . 
  if it were like that , i guess pro-piet people would n't go equally apeshit if someone suggests zwarte piet might be seen as racist . 
  i have no issue with zwarte piet , i have an issue with people who say he must be black . 
  people put almost zero effort into actually understanding why one might find such a phenomenon offensive and immediately go into circlejerk mode . 
  that 's probably true for both sides of the debate , making it go nowhere . 
  i understand the idea . 
  i think it 's less of an issue than with zwarte piet , which has some inherently racial characteristics . 
  ** netherlands ** ** provincial and watership elections ** new provincial and watership councils were elected last wednesday . 
  the provincial councils are nationally important as they in turn elect the members of the senate in may . 
  the ruling liberals - of pm mark rutte 's people 's party for freedom and democracy ( vvd ) - lost some seats but are set to remain the largest party in the senate . 
  the biggest loser this election was the junior coalition partner , the labour party ( pvda ) , which loses nearly half of its seats . 
  both parties only have a majority in the upper house of parliament , but not in the senate . 
  the poor results diminish the governing coalition even further in the senate . 
  three constructive opposition parties - the christian conservatives of the christian union ( cu ) and the political reformed party ( sgp ) as well as the centrist liberals of democrats 66 - so far helped out in the senate in exchange for influence on government propositions . 
  it seems a fourth partner will now be needed despite the strong showing of these three ( d66 in particular made massive gains ) . 
  another winner , the christian democratic appeal ( cda ) is a likely candidate to help the government out on the right . 
  green left ( gl ) lost a senator , but is still large enough to help out from the left side . 
  another winner is the leftist , anti-austerity socialist party ( sp ) , which takes over from labour as the largest left-wing party . 
  the northern province of groningen , which is traditionally labour territory , is now held by the sp . 
  the sp won over many left-leaning voters due to its tough campaign to reduce gas drilling in favour of renewable energy . 
  groningen , traditionally rich on natural gas , suffers earthquakes and damaged houses because the gas reserves are dwindling , making the land sink . 
  dissapointment was there for the far-right freedom party , which was polling very strongly for months , but lost one seat in the senate . 
  this mirrors the parliamentary elections in 2012 and the european elections last year , both of which turned out to be a dissapointment for the right-wing populists . 
  the anti-islam party was expected to capitalise on the recent attacks in france and denmark , but ulitmately failed to do so . 
  it won an important victory in rotterdam , though . 
  issue-specific parties 50plus , a party for senior citizens , and the party for the animals ( pvdd ) both won seats .
