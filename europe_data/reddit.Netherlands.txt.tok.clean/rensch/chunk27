  the indepent senate group ( osf ) , which represents provincial parties like the party for zealand and the frisian national party , keeps its sole senator . 
  the watership councils were elected on the same day . 
  the waterships take care of the dikes , waterworks , dams etc. 
  that keep our country from flooding , such as the delta works . 
  the waterships are often seen as a superfluous layer of government , whose responsibilities should be taken over by provincial governments , but so far they remain a separate body often ignored by voters . 
  to boost democratic participation , the elections were held together with the provincial elections with two different ballots for both . 
  previous watership elections were held not in polling stations but via mail . 
  these were the first ones held in a polling station , just like the provincial , parliamentary , european and municipal elections . 
  the party natural water ( water natuurlijk ) won the most seats nationwide if all watership councils are combined . 
  ** new minister and state secretary for justice & safety ** ard van der steur and klaas dijkhoff ( both vvd mp 's ) are replacing ivo opstelten and fred teeven as minister and state secretary respectively on the justice and safety ministry . 
  opstelten and teeven had to resign last week after not informing parliament correctly . 
  a deal had been struck by teeven with a convicted drug criminal in 2001 . 
  the amount of money involved , it turns out , is much higher than opstelten had initially claimed . 
  nothing illegal has been done , so teeven will - controversially - now become an mp . 
  the seat had been open because vvd mp mark verhijen stepped down after corruption allegations . 
  even more controversial is johan houwers , a vvd politician convicted of fraud . 
  the party does n't accept houwers as one of their own , but houwers can take his seat due to the party list-based system that is used to elect mp 's in the dutch parliament . 
  the vvd recently struggles with many scandals like the ones mentioned here , but the losses at the provincial elections were still quite modest , keeping the party 's position as the country 's largest intact . 
  what kind of game is it ? 
  pok\u00e9mon . 
  it 's still just a much the gaming equivalent of crack that it was when i was twelve .

  the weird part is that provincial councillors in turn elect the senators . 
  due to combined party lists between similar parties , some may snag additional seats by adding leftover votes from their befriended parties to their own . 
  the senate composition may therefor change compared to currently projected results . 
  there are 75 senate seats . 
  some context about the parties : ** the coalition government : ** - ** people 's party for freedom and democracy ( vvd ) : ** liberals , centre-right . 
  despite many recent corruption scandals involving vvd politicians , the party still did relatively well . 
  it lost some seats , but most likely remains the largest party in the senate , much to the relief of prime minister mark rutte who remains quite popular among right-leaning voters . 
  - ** labour party ( pvda ) ** social democrats , centre-left . 
  by far the biggest loser this election . 
  it had to fight a harsh battle on two fronts . 
  left-wing voters feel betrayed by its coalition with the vvd and cuts to social security . 
  those people mostly defect to the socialist party . 
  the party 's moderate wing faces stiff competition from the centrist democrats 66 as well . 
  most of the pvda 's biggest traditional strongholds are now taken over by d66 and sp . 
  loses several seats . 
  ** the `` constructive three '' ** the coalition does n't have a majority in the senate and after these elections its support there will diminish further . 
  so far these three opposition parties have helped the two governing parties pass most of its reforms and laws through the senate . 
  in exchange , these parties have a lot of influence on the contents of these propositions . 
  - ** democrats 66 ( d66 ) ** centrists/liberal democrats . 
  sits in between the vvd and pvda as a naturally constructive opposition party . 
  d66 has made massive gains the past few years . 
  it will likely try to make use of its increased influence in the senate to push for greater and faster application of the reforms it deems necessary . 
  this is the party that made the most gains this election . 
  - ** christian union ( cu ) ** : a christian party that is conservative on many social issues like lgbt rights , euthanasia and abortion , but also progressive on immigrant 's rights and the environment . 
  as an economically centrist party , it holds a position similar to d66 on these kind of issues . 
  makes some gains . 
  - ** political reformed party ( sgp ) ** : orthodox calvinists . 
  very conservative on social issues . 
  economically centre-right and therefor an ally for rutte 's economic agenda . 
  like the cu , it 's set to make some gains ** the other opposition parties : ** one of these parties has to join the governing parties as a fourth ` constructive ' party if the coalition is to retain its senate majority . 
  - ** socialist party ( sp ) ** leftists/socialists . 
  wants an end to austerity in healthcare , social security and education . 
  once a radical protest party , it has matured into a left-wing force to be reckoned with . 
  it governs with parties of many different colours on an increasing number of city and provincial councils . 
  many disgruntled pvda supporters now vote for the sp . 
  the traditionally leftist groningen province , which the pvda normally holds , is now turned towards a deeper red with the sp being the largest party . 
  this likely has a lot to do with the pvda not taking a tough enough stance against reducing gas drilling in favour of renewable energy . 
  once , the gas drillings where a blessing for groningen , nowadays they lead to earthquakes and damaged houses . 
  many groningers want an eventual end to the gas drilling because of this . 
  the sp capitalizes on this . 
  likely wins a ninth seat but is not willing to support rutte 's government in the senate . 
  - ** christian democratic appeal ( cda ) ** christian democrats , centre-right . 
  the coalition and the constructive three do not have a senate majority anymore . 
  the cda is a prime candidate to help out this fragile coalition , but party leader sybrand buma plays hard to get . 
  he will have some demands , especially because of his party 's strong showing this election . 
  does well and gains a seat . 
  - ** freedom party ( pvv ) ** far-right , populist . 
  led by anti-eu , anti-islam politician geert wilders . 
  polled strongly initially , but ultimately seems to lose a seat . 
  won a psychologically important victory in the large city of rotterdam , though . 
  mostly a protest party . 
  opposes rutte 's government . 
  - ** green left ( gl ) ** greens , centre-left . 
  a smaller left-of-center party that is likely to drop from five to four senators . 
  still , it could be an important ally for the pvda to bring in more left-wing ideals to the negotiating table against cda , d66 and vvd . 
  more willing to work together with the government than the sp . 
  - ** party for the animals ( pvdd ) ** small animal rights party . 
  increasingly popular among environmentalist voters . 
  made some gains and could win a seat . 
  - ** 50plus ** party for senior citizens . 
  wins an extra seat and is projected to get two senators . 
  - ** independent senate group ( osf ) ** represents provincial interest parties like the frisian national party and the party for zealand in the senate . 
  keeps its sole seat . 
  i personally think it needs to be abolished or at least directly elected . 
  it currently is more of a burden than anything else . 
  this is about the past week , not this week . 
  your country has got one of the biggest issues with corruption , but at least it 's increasingly willing to tackle the problem from what i hear . 
  guess that 's a very good thing . 
  might also be a campaign stunt by the cda , though . 
  oh we have our share of corrupt politicians too . 
  read the first bit in my previous post about the vvd party . 
  some of these scandals surrounding that party are about corruption charges . 
  it may not be as much of an issue as in romania , but it 's currently a hot topic in the media . 
  not really a good moment for the vvd as provincial elections are held today . 
  one of their ministers even put on her tin foil hat by suggesting these revelations have been made right before the elections to discredit the party . 
  ton hooimaijers , a former deputee ( like a provincial minister ) in south holland is now in jail for whitewashing money , bribery and fraud . 
  and an alderman in the southern town of roermond is currently being tried on charges of corruption as well . 
  this is all kinda ironic since the vvd is allways talking about ` careful use of taxpayer money ' and talks tough on crime .
