  you do n't get away with this in the netherlands . 
  the closest thing we ever had was [ this poster ] ( https://koenschyvens.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/psp-poster.jpg ) by the pacifist-socialist party , a small hippie party in the 70s . 
  this sounds exactly like our own noord-zuidlijn , a subway tunnel in amsterdam . 
  the areas around dam square looked like utter shit because of that project for years . 
  the amount of money and time turned out to be much higher than projected , partially because the foundations of the historic buildings in the city centre had to be reinfoced to prevent the whole thing from sinking into the ground . 
  ** netherlands ** - ** vvd continues to struggle with scandals ** the ruling liberal party is faced with numerous scandals surrounding mp 's , city councillors , aldermen and even cabinet members . 
  state secretary fred teeven and minister ivo opstelten ( both justice and safety ) have resigned this week . 
  teeven had struck a compensation deal with arested drug dealer cees h. and his lawyer in 2001 . 
  the amount of money h. recieved turned out to be much higher than teeven and opstelten had initially claimed . 
  news bulletin nieuwsuur revealed evidence earlier that claimed parliament had not been properly informed . 
  the justice ministry revealed documentation this week that proves this claim to be correct , forcing the two to resign . 
  besides that , numerous local and provincial party leaders are faced with allegations of corruption or incorrect use of public funds . 
  the revelations come at a profoundly uncomfortable moment for prime minister mark rutte as provincial council elections are held this wednesday . 
  the provincial councillors in turn elect the senate . 
  the negative media coverage could weaken the vvd/labour coalition 's already fragile support in the senate . 
  both parties face stiff competition from the centrists of democrats 66 and the far-right pvv . 
  further competition comes mostly from the leftist socialist party , which is especially popular among dissapointed labour supporters .

  the animal had been spotted in various residential areas since last week . 
  the owl attracted worldwide media attention after terrorizing the dutch town the past few weeks .

  he is the son of former racer jos verstappen , who was active during the 90s . 
  it was n't exactly a shining entrance on the world stage as verstappen had to quit because of a failure in his car 's engine . 
  verstappen is considered one of the sport 's most promising young talents . 
  i personally think they went a bit far to disrupt it last year . 
  it 's a kid 's festival after all . 
  still , i think it 's kind of a strange phenomenon in this day and age . 
  i can understand why foreigners are baffled by it . 
  here you get arrested for disrupting the blackface parade instead . 
  it 's weird and i stopped trying to be apologetic for it years ago . 
  our seafood is actually really good . 
  people often think of all the potatoe variants , but seafood is where it 's truly at . 
  kibbeling , mussels , oysters , prawns , you name it . 
  it 's just the raw herring thing that 's really odd . 
  if you like seafood , eat it with lamsoren or zeekraal . 
  those are salty vegetables mostly found and sold in zeeland , where the seafood is actually rather refined . 
  we also have plenty of pastries that are really good . 
  try poffertjes . 
  or speculaas , pepernoten or kruidnoten during st. nicholas season . 
  we also consume and produce more chocolate than belgium , something that a lot of people are unaware of . 
  even the bland stuff like stamppot can be amazing when spiced up with indonesian spices . 
  and smoked sausage is actually really good in and of itself . 
  vinegar on chips is absolutely disgraceful . 
  but at least you guys have a better variety in desserts . 
  but we have a wider selection of bread than any other country . 
  there 's got ta be something for everyone . 
  because , unlike greece , you are not part of the eurozone or the eu and therefor we do n't payfor your debt . 
  i do n't blame the greek people , i blame the politicians that funded their olympics and early retirement programs with fake money . 
  ca n't blame 'em for trying out a new party , whatever its positions . 
  whatever path the government takes : harsh germany-backed austerity or leaving the eurozone , the people of greece are being fucked . 
  this will blow up the internet someday : some think this phone is pink , others say magenta . 
  that would be logical if you consider a federal europe desirable . 
  most people in europe seem to prefer a more loose framework of nation states working together on common interests . 
  while i do n't think the idea of a federal europe is inherently bad , i think the differences in the economies , cultures and political leanings are still too different to make that a feasible idea any time soon . 
  the comparison with the us is not entirely fair . 
  they formed in a different time as a bunch of colonies around a common idea of democracy and independence from the uk . 
  there was a shared identity . 
  the european identity is much more ecclectic if it exists at all . 
  i am not saying i am opposed to it , but it would potentially create another field that national governments would not have sovereignity over . 
  i 'd like my country to be able to decide for itself on a serious thing like going to war . 
  for international military cooperation , we already have nato . 
  i do n't see what substantial benefits an eu army could add to that . 
  for me it 's similar . 
  i am interested in us politics and culture as well . 
  i guess it would be the same the other way around . 
  north america and europe are similar in many ways , so i guess it 's easy to relate to one another . 
  all our prime ministers were white , straight males so far . 
  so nothing spectacular there . 
  ( well , we 're still not entirely sure about mark rutte being straight . ), 
  there have been plenty of minority mayors , ministers and state secretaries , though . 
  the most notable one right now is former amsterdam alderman and former state secretary of social affairs and jobs ** ahmed aboutaleb ** . 
  he is currently the labour party 's mayor of rotterdam . 
  he 's notable for being one of the few muslim mayors of a larger european city and recently called for jihadists to ` bugger off ' . 
  he was born in morocco . 
  then there 's ** nebahat albayrak ** ( labour ) , former state secretary of justice . 
  she was born to turkish parents . 
  ** ien dales ** ( labour ) was the first lgbt minister . 
  only after her death was it revealed she was a lesbian . 
  she was state secretary of social affairs and internal affairs minister . 
  ** geert dales ** , of the liberal vvd party , was an openly gay major of leeuwarden , friesland 's provincial capital . 
  ** peter rehwinkel ** ( labour ) was a gay major in naarden and groningen . 
  ** gerda verburg ** was an openly lesbian minister of agriculture . 
  despite being a christian democrat , she was one of the first in her cda party to support lgbt marriage equality and the only cda mp back in 2000 to vote for it . 
  minister of finance ** jan-kees de jager ** ( cda ) was openly gay when he held that office . 
  ** ahmed marcouch ** ( labour ) was the moroccan chair of the slotervaart borough in amsterdam before becoming an mp . 
  ** fatima elatik ** ( labour ) was the moroccan chair of the amsterdam borough of zeeburg , now part of amsterdam-east . 
  then there have been plenty of mp 's and former mp 's , including ** john van leerdam ** ( labour , antillian ) , lgbt chair at human rights watch ** boris dittrich ** ( democrats 66 , gay and half czech ) , ** kathleen ferrier ** ( cda , daughter of surinamese president ronald ferrier ) , islam critic and prominent atheist ** ayaan hirsi ali ** ( vvd , somali ) , ** laetitia griffith ** ( vvd , surinamese ) , labour dissidents ** tunahan kuzu ** and ** selcuk \u00d6zt\u00fcrk ** ( both of turkish descent ) ** farshad bashir ** ( sp , afghan ) and sadet karabulut ( sp , turkish-kurdish ) . 
  there 's plenty more i forgot about . 
  then there was off course ** pim fortuyn ** , a popular and flamboyant right-wing populist who got killed before he could actually get elected in 2002 's general election . 
  he was an influential , openly gay political leader . 
  that looks just like hogwart 's . 
  when i was a kid , my grandfather used to take me to [ fort rammekens ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=fort+rammekens&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ptv7vjssgsf4op6kgfgh&amp;ved=0cagq_auoag&amp;biw=1252&amp;bih=602 ) , supposedly the oldest sea fortress in western europe . 
  as a kid , i found this place really fascinating . 
  it has dark , damp corridors where bats lurk . 
  there 's also a great overview of the westerscheldt flowing into the north sea from atop the thick walls . 
  fort rammekens stems from the 1500s , the time of the independence war against the spanish empire , which would lead to the foundation of the powerful dutch republic . 
  today it can still be visited and is often host to theatrical performances and art expositions . 
  the surrounding area is nice as well . 
  there are woods and pools where many water birds nest . 
  these pools were created in ww2 .
