  it has its own government and a great deal of freedom to make its own decisions . 
  - northern ireland has always been divided between unionists , which are traditionally protestant and want northern ireland to remain part of the uk , and republicans , who are traditionally catholic and want to join ireland .

  i do n't think i 've seen this , but i remember a wizard of oz anime . 
  dutch here . 
  every kid grows up with `` dribbel '' . 
  do n't think so . 
  never seen them . 
  he 's not quite as popular as other belgian characters like tintin , smurfs , suske & wiske or lucky luke , but he 's well-known here . 
  we call him guust flater . 
  this one 's huge here . 
  does anyone actually remember tintin doing any actual reporting in any of those comics ? 
  my favourite episode was when he built that rocket ship and actually found all those weird planets . 
  this looks like they were on acid . 
  i do n't know it , but i get a stargate/bsg vibe from this picture . 
  there 's also a history version . 
  caaaaalimerooo !!!, 
  we had a vhs tape , but i am not sure if i actually ever watched it on tv . 
  i only know like the first two or three episodes because of that . 
  know about it but i never saw it as a kid . 
  apparently the voice acting was added in the dutch version . 
  there were no voices in the original . 
  come to think of it , it 's all slapstick/visual comedy so it 's not really needed . 
  but still it would n't be quite as good without it . 
  the dungeon scene scared the hell out of me . 
  with those creepy guys in there ( i think they were rats ) . 
  the nazi 's , apartheid , doping , pollution . 
  if you watch this again as an adult , it goes right in the childhood . 
  the song is great . 
  the book is famous all over the world , this cartoon helped made it even more well-known . 
  this one i remember watching when i was like five or so . 
  i know it aired but i do n't recall seeing it as a child .

  he 's like what miffy is for the dutch , tintin for belgium or mickey mouse for the us .

  pat and mat is actually one of the most popular tv shows here in the netherlands . 
  i member . 
  there was one with the human body and one about history . 
  there might be more , though . 
  i have all of them and still buy each new one . 
  there seem to be quite a few lgbt le pen supporters . 
  younsaw the same phenomenon in the us with trump after the florida shooting . 
  - neutrality - not in eu - not in the eurozone either . 
  they have the swiss franc as currency . 
  - banking secret - cheese and fondue - located in the alps - german , italian and french are all official languages . 
  - federal republic - swiss clocks - swiss army knives - bern is the capital . 
  other major cities unclude geneva , z\u00fcrich and basel . 
  - has a square for a flag instead of a rectangular one . 
  - direct democracy and referndums . 
  i like it , but it would feel more authentically dutch if there were more bicycles in this picture . 
  the cabinet `` everyone but wilders 1 '' . 
  i agree . 
  can you imagine how much better the entirety of the netherlands with all of its twelve provinces , not just two , is compared to belgium . 
  you have no idea how much we dutch appreciate statements like this . 
  suck in that , r/finland . 
  let 's hook him up with rutte . 
  the best part is the original used to feature hero brinkman instead of fleur agema before brinkman was kicked out of the pvv . 
  a friend of mine still has the calendar this was from . 
  it featured various celebrities as their heroes . 
  this is basically like that scene in life of brian . 
  the german one was great . 
  i also really liked belgium 's manneken pis dressed up as a russian hooker pissing over a hotel bed .

  - capital is warsaw . 
  - other major cities include places like cracow , wroclaw , poznan and lodz . 
  - currency is the zloty - auschwitz ( ozwiecim ) concentration camp . 
  if you are in the cracow/catowice area , this is well worth a visit . 
  emotionally heavy , but a must-see for all those interested in wwii history . 
  - pope john paul ii . 
  - there 's lots of them here since they joined the eu .
