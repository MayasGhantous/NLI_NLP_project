  i remember hearing the chinese were there long before europeans ever visited australia . 
  finally something we beat finland at . 
  yet it 's called that for some reason . 
  just your regular spring break . 
  is that not a thing in your country . 
  i fucked up on forgetting aletta jacobs . 
  i will go ahead and add orwell to that . 
  his writing has become more relevant than ever last year . 
  carnaval . 
  this is only in the catholic southern parts , mostly brabant and limburg provinces . 
  the recess is nationwide however , but in catholic communities it is planned so that it is in the same week as carnaval . 
  where do you study exactly ? 
  thanks . 
  those are two i should have mentioned . 
  their contributions to science are something we should be a little more proud of . 
  but i guess you are probably right about the hero-worship thing . 
  it is our calvinistic background i guess . 
  these are some of the more notable ones : william ` the silent ' of orange-nassau - father of the nation . 
  iconic figure who was one of the leaders of the independence movement during the 1500s when the increasingly protestant netherlands revolted against the catholic spanish empire . 
  the royal family still traces back its heritage to this man . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_the_silent michiel adriaanszoon de ruyter - famous admiral who led the dutch fleet to victory in its wars with britian . 
  still a symbol of the dutch as a naval nation . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michiel_de_ruyter anne frank - jewish girl whose preserved diary gave an insight in what it was like to be captive in your own house during wwii and the nazi terror . 
  the diary is one of the prime classics of world literature . 
  the anne frank house in downtown amsterdam is one of the most visited places in our country . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anne_frank johan rudolph thorbecke - liberal prime minister in the mid-nineteenth century . 
  drafted a constitution in which the king would give up most of his power . 
  while initially only rich males had the right to vote , this new constitution became the foundation on which a fully democratic society - in which all classes and sexes had the same rights - would eventually be built in the early 1900s . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_rudolph_thorbecke willem drees - considered by many to be our greatest post-war prime minister . 
  politically a social democrat , he was responsible for much of our pension system and oversaw much of the post-war restoration policies , first as minister of social security and then as pm . 
  not only did he invest heavily in pensions and affordable health care for all , his tenure also saw a surprisingly fast recovery from the devastation of wwii . 
  drees was known to be a pragmatic man . 
  his socialist-dominated labour party would succesfully govern with conservatives and liberals . 
  still held in high regard , particularly among progressives and the elderly . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/willem_drees desiderius erasmus - humanist thinker , catholic priest , social critic and satirist . 
  author of ` the praise of folly ' , a famous satire attacking western superstitions , traditions and dogmas . 
  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/desiderius_erasmus baruch spinoza - jewish freethinker and philosopher . 
  known best for his magnum opus ` ethics ' , a classic example of the new freethinking of the renaissance . 
  http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/baruch_spinoza vincent van gogh - painter and impressionist . 
  known for his tragic life and posthumous fame . 
  his colourful works are among the most famous in world art . 
  famous for such works as ` the sunflowers ' , ' a sidewalk caf\u00e9 at night ' and ` night sky ' . 
  friend of fellow impressionist renoir . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vincent_van_gogh rembrandt van rijn - probably the most famous of the golden age dutch masters . 
  painter of the ` night 's guard ' . 
  http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/rembrandt_van_rijn piet mondriaan - famous as one of the figureheads of the stijl , a modern art form during the 1920s known for its rectangular shapes and primary colours . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piet_mondrian maurits cornelis escher - together with people like magritte and dali , escher was one of the most famous surrealists . 
  recurring themes are dimensions , optical illusions , infinity and impossibilities . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m._c._escher johan cruyff - football legend . 
  considered by many as the best european player ever . 
  gorgeous city by the way . 
  parks are everywhere and there is always a place to grab a drink or ice cream . 
  til san marino , vatican city and monaco have their own euros . 
  chocolate vla . 
  vla is kind of like pudding or custard . 
  it comes in many flavours , including natural , vanilla , strawberry and more , but chocolate is easily the best . 
  mark syrup ? 
  probably mark stroop . 
  here in the netherlands , actual dialect is much more prominent in rural areas . 
  in urban areas ( the ` randstad ' ) it is mostly accents with some added slang . 
  it probably is much more difficult for someone from rotterdam to understand my dialect ( zeeuws , southwest of the country ) than it is for me to understand what he or she is saying . 
  i understand everything people say in those areas , while dialects of more rural places like parts of limburg or groningen would be much harder for me to follow as well . 
  i 'd say zeeuws is a pretty strong dialect . 
  it has a certain flow that makes is difficult to follow or imitate for outsiders . 
  although not entirely homogeneous or canonized , there are some constants in all of its sub-dialects : - the typical hard g 's in dutch are often pronounced as an ` h ' , especially at the beginning or a word . 
  goedendag ( good day to you ) becomes ` hoeiendag ' . 
  even in swearing this is prevalent . 
  godverdomme ( god dammit ) becomes ` hosternokke ' . 
  - the letter ` h ' is is often silent . 
  hond ( dog ) becomes ` ond . 
  as such ' a dog ' or ` een hond ' often becomes 'n ` ond , simply prounounced as ` nond ' . 
  - the dutch ` ui ' ( nonexistent in english ) becomes ` uu ' . 
  onion = ui or ajuin = juun . 
  - the long ` ij ' such as in ` blij ' , ` fijn ' , ` mijn ' ( happy , nice , mine ) becomes ` ie ' ( pronounced as ` ee ' as in ` sheep ' ) . 
  the short ` ei ' as in ` ei ' or ` klein ' ( egg , small ) remains the same as in dutch . 
  - different fro dutch are usually the vowels , but how they are used and when differs greatly from area to area . 
  much like the zwarte piet debate has become an annual holiday tradition , the debate about banning fireworks started again around new year 's day . 
  a number of mayors , aldermen , city council members and doctors from around the country have called for such a ban , saying fireworks are simply too dangerous for personal use . 
  critics of this idea have said prohibition would not make a difference , as fireworks would simply be bought in belgium or online . 
  it is also feared the same problems we had when weed was fully criminalized would arise with fireworks as well . 
  does nva do this as well now ? 
  i thought this stuff was what still separated vlaams belang ideologically from nva . 
  why does nobody mention the fairy tale kingdom known as brussels : http://defence.flemingeurope.com/webdata/2222/brussel_800x5332.jpg, 
  that 's how i learned about the baby jesus story , not from the bible . 
  that 's also kind of a decorative thing is n't it . 
  here in the netherlands few people are still celebrating it in a religious way . 
  atheists and agnostics do everything christians do , but without going to church or saying prayers . 
  those that are not really practising christians , but still believe in some way , usually only go to church on christmas eve . 
  presents are given in some families but the whole children 's fairy tale thing is for sinterklaas ( st. nicholas ) eve on december 5th . 
  santa claus is often seen as a cheap , americanized imitation of sinterklaas and more of a decor thing rather than a true tradition . 
  while sinterklaas is originally a religious thing , it has mostly been secularized , just like christmas . 
  some people give presents on both holidays , some on either sinterklaas or christmas . 
  some traditional christmas songs differ depending on which school you attend . 
  if your parents sent you to a religious school the song `` kling klokje '' has the sentence `` jezus is gekomen '' ( jesus has come ) . 
  if you go to a secular school on the other hand , the song might be secularized into `` kerstmis is gekomen '' ( christmas has come ) . 
  like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7np3muxoji&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player, 
  i am from the netherlands , not from holland . 
  and i use united kingdom only to refer to the whole thing when that is needed . 
  because eating too much vla makes you gay . 
  it 's legal over here , but i see even less merit in recriminalizing it .
