  - oktoberfest . 
  - capital is berlin . 
  as much as i believe the eu is a good thing , i agree the idea that the eu is almost always a good thing only undermines the eu . 
  there still is a democratic deficit in the eu . 
  why do meps not have the parliamentary right of initiative ? 
  why can i not vote for candidates from other eu member states , even though their policy-making affects me ? 
  europe does n't exactly do enough to get people involved politically . 
  this only gives way to euroskeptics and then to reactionary europhiles . 
  where are the people who really have fresh ideas on how to improve the eu that go beyond either ` the eu is evil and we should leave it ' or ` the eu is awesome and everyone who disagrees is fucking retarded ' . 
  i do n't think these two groups are dominant politically , but they are the ones that media pay attention two , not the silent majority . 
  a problem you might have is dining at such a place requires you to reserve a table well in advance . 
  here in the netherlands , the best restaurant is oud sluis in the southwestern town of sluis . 
  i heard of people who had to reserve more than a year in advance to get a table there . 
  a much more informative map would be one with voting systems like proportional representation or first-past-the-post .

  i love how our country is still fully there . 
  due to our dikes and delta works and such , we are actually much better protected against floods than other areas in europe that are not as low as we are . 
  imagine how fresh the mussels that come with your chips would be . 
  i love this guy . 
  he does n't give dick shit about any ruling doctrine and makes up his own mind . 
  a truly independent spirit . 
  that was one of the most eerily accurate celebrity impressions i 've seen in a while . 
  `` we need to cut the ballsjh of thosjh in power and so on and so on . '', 
  i do not know what you are talking about , but i am pretty sure we gained independence in 1581 . 
  yeah , many people think of the americas when it 's about former spanish territories , but many parts of europe were part of the spanish empire as well , not just iberia . 
  this is a form of authoritarian behaviour on the pretense of democracy and people 's rule . 
  why should people even vote on the expansion of human rights ? 
  by allowing a vote on this , it seems the people are being involved , but really it is just a means of giving legitimacy to discrimination . 
  it creates a false sense of freedom .

  rabobank , often called the most trustworthy ( or the least corrupt at least ) of the four too-big-to-fail banks in the netherlands , actually artificially influenced interest rates . 
  the ceo is forced to resign . 
  - berlusconi - roman empire - dante - julius ceasar - galileo galilei - fascist regime of benito mussolini was an example for hitler and his nazi party . 
  - leonardo da vinci - michelangelo - pasta - coffee - pizza - the maffia - substantial diaspora in other countries such as the us and belgium - generally just one of the world 's most culturally significant nation, 
  this guy was never truly popular , he won because he was not sarkozy , not because everyone wanted the ps in office . 
  - formerly part of ussr , now very much anti-russian . 
  there was even a dispute about authonomous provinces that reaulted into an unlikely war against the giant that is russia .

  there is a classmate of mine doing this subject right now . 
  might be interesting to her . 
  december 6th is actually the day that st. nicholas supposedly died . 
  according to christian tradidtion , the day a saint dies becomes his name day when he has achieved the stature of being a saint . 
  so december 6th has been st. nicholas day for centuries . 
  we dutch celebrate it mostly on st. nicholas eve , which is the evening before like christmas eve is the evening before christmas or halloween the eveing before all hallow 's day . 
  it was n't until many european cultures and holidays started mixing in 1800s new york that santa became associated with christmas . 
  many of the themes of christmas and st. nicholas day are the same , though . 
  they are after all rooted both rooted in christian tradition . 
  this mistake pops up even in respected international media like cnn and bbc . 
  so exactly why does that make a difference . 
  is religion not based on a tradition , if anything ? 
  very little other than that it supposedly is really corrupt politically . 
  it 's also one of europe 's poorer countries . 
  former soviet republic , now independent , but still very much looking towards moscow for economic reasons . 
  - the annual debate on wether or not st. nicholas ' helper zwarte piet is racist . 
  - continued diplomatic tensions with russia . 
  - government 's budget plans now have support in senate after a deal with several opposition parties . 
  thou shalt not use the name of thy lord zwarte piet in vain , for he shall surely smithe thee with his trusty rod . 
  amen . 
  much less than in belgium . 
  even if you have been a little naughty , you get presents . 
  sinterklaas may be a saint , but he 's a little naughty himself sometimes . 
  that 's kind of the attitude today . 
  there are no religious connontations to sinterklaas anymore , because saints are more of a catholic thing . 
  apart from limburg and brabant , the netherlands has mostly a calvinist tradition . 
  the sinterklaas or zwarte piet that threatens with the rod or putting kids in the sack to be taken back to spain is seen as old-fashioned and bad parenting these days . 
  you are always worthy of presents . 
  i little correction , in a friendly way , is the worst that sinterklaas might do .
