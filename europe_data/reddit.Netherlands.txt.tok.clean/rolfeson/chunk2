   and a big portion of the populace as well this is simply false . 
   the only things that you and your ilk have left is the political correctness card oh noes le pc !, 
  ! 1 i 'll have you know that i am a bigoted right winger , 
  how ? 
  hey , i also just invented my own definition of `` unintelligent '' !, 
  unintelligent ( adjective ) : 1 . 
  someone who does not know the correct definition of `` fairy tale '', 
  because a fairy tale is a very limited definition of a particular genre of prose , for one . 
  second of all , your definition of `` religious '' is most likely based on the western perception of religion . 
  buddhism , for example , is a religion that does not need to depend on myths ( fairy tales , as you condescendingly call them ) . 
  given your rhetoric so far i take it you had to go to church with mommy and daddy every sunday and you really did not like it . 
  how hateful and caught up in your own ideology do you have to be to dismiss people in such a manner ? 
  to call them close to unintelligent for merely the act of believing . 
  do you happen to go to uni ? 
  if so , what do you study . 
  damn . 
   nope , just because you ca n't imagine an existence without belief does n't mean that somebody else ca n't have one . 
  are you implying you do n't believe in anything ? 
   while for everyday use , the words `` believe '' and `` presume '' are often used synonymously , they do have more specific and differing meanings when pitted against each other . 
  how does that change my point ? 
   i do n't need to believe that i can trust a family member due to past experience of them proving to be trustworthy what if something happens that causes your trust in a family member to wane for a while ( lies , deceit , crappy birthday present ) . 
  then you can not know for sure whether you can trust your family member in future situations . 
  yet you might still be inclined to do ( or not to do ) despite the evidence pointing the other way . 
   believing in science is an oxymoron since the whole premise of science is to prove things how does the one exclude the other ? 
  if the premise of science is to prove things , one can still believe in the validity of the scientific method . 
   i do n't accept the findings just because it was written up by a scientist , anybody to do so would be a fool . 
  well , many people do anyways . 
  how do you solve this for yourself ? 
  do you simply read every single scientific study out there ? 
   what i can reasonably presume though , is that the conclusion of a scientist with the appropriate credentials is better than an opinion or a belief or nothing at all . 
  `` presume '' , `` is better '' - i smell * belief * . 
   that 's true and as long as they are willing to change with new information , that is a perfectly reasonable thing to do for most people . 
  i agree , but do you not see that in order for people to accept all that science without having read studies , research or papers , they would have to have a level of belief in the scientist 's work ? 
   the simplest reason being that all the religions are inconsistent and logically non-viable . 
  how so ? 
   if a religion gets a pass by your faculties of critical thinking then those faculties must be broken critical thinking = / = being against religion  all evidence to the contrary , all nations with religion built into their government suffer from human rights violations , high power disparity and low overall development . 
  meanwhile the countries with no religion in their government are generally more egalitarian , wealthy and developed . 
  could you cite a study that statistically proves this ? 
  i 'm sorry , i would be a fool to just accept that   as to why this is , my theory is that religiously run states are less logical and thus have a natural disadvantage compared to other less religious states . 
  why are religiously run states ( you mean countries with an official state religion ? ), 
  less logical ? 
  how does being less logical negatively affect a state compared to so-called more logical states ? 
  which states would you define as more logical , and why ? 
  we were n't discussing snake oils or homeopathy , but religion . 
  if someone makes a meme comment i will reply with a meme comment as well . 
   the true part in `` justified true belief '' can not be defined by faith . 
  it 's not defined as such . 
  well , there are a lot , ** a lot ** of singular beliefs . 
  not so much seperate religions . 
   not necessarily but they can , sure . 
  no , they do . 
  you ** believe ** you can trust a friend or family member , you ** believe ** that a particular t-shirt looks best on you , you even ** believe ** in science ( do you not have to trust a scientist 's judgement in order to accept his findings ? 
  not everyone who accepts scientific findings as fact has read all scientific studies themselves ; in that sense you are often taking the scientists word for it ) . 
  in fact , in the classical definition of knowledge in the field of philosophy concerned with knowledge , * epistemology * , knowledge is defined as justified true belief ( that is , one holds a belief , this belief is true , and one has a good reason to think this belief is true ) . 
   also possible but a religious person would have the odds stacked against him . 
  why ? 
   good as in optimal for the development of the nation and the well being of its citizens . 
  what if a religious person might argue that his religion is optimal for the developement of his nation and the well being of its citizens ? 
  one can ignore the nearly the entire bible , yet still believe god exists . 
  in that sense this person would be a believer . 
  my proposition is that non-religious people ( atheists and agnostics ) also believe in lots of stuff , and do n't necessarily make more `` good '' decisions where it matters ( what is your definition of good in this context btw ? 
  adhering to a specific set of beliefs = / = believing in fairy tales, 
  you can believe in god and still be a '' `` realistic '' '' critical thinker \u2122 . 
  you can believe in a lot of things . 
  all people believe in lots of things . 
  ( tips fedora ) ( thinks rationally \u2122 ), 
   that 's close to the defition of unintelligent . 
  how about ignorance towards people who hold different views from your own , how close is that to the definition of unintelligent . 
  being religious does not mean that you automatically believe in fairy tales . 
  keep that fedora on , my fellow rational \u2122 free-thinker \u2122 . 
   realistic critical thinking lmao what does this even mean . 
  typical croissant agitprop . 
  the flemish are our brothers . 
  baguettes have no right to life . 
  no this is not true delet this, 
  daily reminder that brussels was once a dutch speaking city , before the vile croissant took over . 
  the belgian royal family are french puppets . 
  stroopwafelpiet you mean ? 
  i want my money back , stavros . 
  i was n't trying to give constructive criticism , my fam, 
   ok , got it . 
  nope, 
  some alternatives have not been discovered yet , 
  because democracy sucks . 
  the left does not care about the * native * working class . 
  the left is internationalist . 
   even if it means breaking any law yes but those laws may be broken because they are fascist !!, 
  that is a very ... platitudinal view of history . 
  let 's cool it with the snark there , friendo . 
  no :'( i want free markets to end, 
  epick comment . 
  you must be very smart and educationalized !, 
  wow !, 
  i 'm not hungarian though . 
  no , trump is insane and will launch nukes on mexico . 
  i read so on twitter . 
   then we better all start learning mandarin . 
  indeed . 
  either america is the leader of the so-called free world , or ( one can only hope ) the so-called free world collapses as a strong single bloc . 
  western european nations need the military and strategic aid the united states provides in order to stay liberal .
