   euthanasia and gay marriage . 
  the vvd is more neutral/negative to some of these issues . 
  every political party except the small christian sgp and cu are in favour of euthanasia . 
  cu is also in favour of gay marriage at this point . 
  they 're non-issues in dutch politics today . 
   real refugees , yes . 
  pvv wants to withdraw all asylum residence permits , close down all asylum centers , and ban all immigrants from islamic countries and all refugees . 
   restricting immigration have you seen the pvv programme ? 
  the following literally ( yes , literally , not ` literally ' ) takes up half of their entire ` verkiezingsprogramma ' :  millions of dutch citizens have simply had enough of ** the islamization of our country . 
  enough of mass immigration and asylum , terror , violence and insecurity . 
  **  this is what the pvv will do : 1 . 
  ** de-islamize ** the netherlands - zero asylum seekers and no immigrants anymore from islamic countries : close the borders - ** withdraw all asylum residence permits ** which have already been granted for specific periods , close the asylum centers - ** no islamic headscarves ** in public functions - ** prohibition of other islamic expressions which violate public order ** - ** preventive detention of radical muslims ** - denaturalization and expulsion of criminals with a dual nationality - jihadists who went to syria will not be allow to return to the netherlands - ** close all mosques and islamic schools , ban the koran ** that 's ... a * little * bit beyond just ` restricting immigration ' do n't you think ? 
  wow , that 's impressive . 
  i think the definition of ` dictatorship ' almost by necessity invalidates ( b ) . 
  otherwise , i 'd point to singapore and rwanda as the most successful modern dictatorships . 
  that 's not to say i support them , but their successes in terms of achieving economic growth , security , less corruption and even popularity are indisputable . 
  i think you mean casualty . 
  [ we 'll be fine with and without the us ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/images/nato-budget-trend.gif ), 
  [ the only time article v has been invoked ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/13/us/after-attacks-alliance-for-first-time-nato-invokes-joint-defense-pact-with-us.html ) it has been to support the us after they were the ones being attacked . 
  i 'm guessing you were n't born just yet , so i 'll let it slide . 
  never saw this in nl, 
  and yet cyprus is in the eu, 
  yeah you 're pretty clueless . 
  there is a target on national defense spending for the future which many nato countries do n't meet . 
  that does n't mean ` payments to nato ' or shirking . 
  it 's an arbitrary figure that i find too high anyway . 
  1 % of gdp as defense spending would be perfectly sufficient for national defense . 
  many countries outside nato that are in much more dangerous neighborhoods with much lower gdp figures spend less than the target , but they 're perfectly fine . 
  also , who is the us supposed to defend the eu against , exactly ? 
  yeah , do n't see trump defending us against putin . 
  plus , the eu is perfectly capable of defending against a failing autocracy with an economy the size of spain on its own , thank you . 
  besides , the only time article 5 was invoked , we came to the defense of the us , not the other way round . 
  if germans trusted the us under the trump admin , that would worry me a lot more, 
  it 's so dumb it 's brilliant, 
  same here . 
  but then i prefer black girls anyway , so it makes sense, 
  that 's a little different , usually . 
  they 're not particularly ideologically motivated , but instead generally kidnapped and forcibly recruited . 
   all do respect i guess you could just be borderline literate, 
  why are you pretending to be american ? 
  no american would write ` with all do reszpect ', 
  who said anything about the middle east, 
  where are you really from ? 
  it 's wilders , and no he does not, 
  there 's a civil war in morocco ? 
  news to me, 
  yeah , it was not completely unexpected given his abysmal popularity , but it 's still very unusual . 
  sitting presidents usually do n't step aside . 
  another way of seeing it is that all 3 gracefully stepped out of the way . 
  none of them were required to . 
  she was definitely the populist candidate in that election , though, 
  huh , i had n't seen this yet . 
  about time !, 
  i bet mugabe will outlast every dictator currently still in charge at this rate, 
  there were talking about trump as well , so clearly it was a reflection on global politics, 
  well , that 's just about the tiniest silver lining i could imagine . 
  not a surprise if you look at the news they 're watching . 
  it 's all panic all the time, 
  he 's conceded already, 
  there have been some other encouraging results in elections this year . 
  hard-line daughter of a dictator fujimori was defeated in peru , and the longtime dictator jammeh just recently was completely unexpectedly defeated in gambia . 
  even less likely . 
  there is no one with the popularity of wilders in germany, 
  and that means the anti establishment would have to get an outright majority . 
  tell me which party in germany is capable of this, 
  there is no electoral college in germany, 
  when she was secretary of state , senator , and as first lady she had extremely high favorable numbers . 
  at many points during her careers she was the single most popular politician in the us . 
  she only became unpopular during the campaign this year, 
  if she was calling it wwi it seems like she was prepared, 
  rtfa, 
  in the case of wilders , trump , and bojo , i 'm certain their distinctive and somewhat laughable hairstyle has helped them cultivate their image as outsiders who do n't care about keeping up appearances and just ` saying it as it is ' ; they do n't look like your average suit-and-tie , perfectly coiffed bureaucratic drone . 
  maybe it also somewhat softens the blow of some of their more aggressive statements . 
  they all have some intrinsic plausible deniability because they can claim they were sort of joking when it 's convenient . 
  looking a bit ridiculous helps with that . 
  yeah , among the older generation even in nl there are many who do n't speak even conversational english, 
  taut thoughts are taught through tough thorough thought , though, 
   simpler and more flexible grammar except when it comes to tenses, 
  yeah i 'd agree with that . 
  it does n't make sense to call it a country up until that point . 
  i thought most of the congo was n't directly affected by much of the arab slave trade though ? 
  that was further east i reckon ? 
  the western most parts of now-drc were affected by the transatlantic trade though, 
  why are people so easily baited here . . 
  ` congo was always bad , he just made it worse ' what do you mean by this ? 
  from what i 've read about some of the precolonial kingdoms i do n't think it was much worse than other parts of africa, 
  ca n't really blame him for that, 
  the reason they do this is as a commentary on what they see as an unfounded jewish persecution complex . 
  the idea is that at best the jews did n't really suffer and are just using their holocaust credit to manipulate the goy public , and at worst they believe that the jews manufactured the holocaust entirely so they could reclaim israel . 
  either way minimizing the shoah signals their disbelief in the ` official story ' . 
  it 's disgusting but i can see how it could be effective, 
  i think we can give jezza some credit there, 
  optimistic about no winning . 
  pessimistic about the impact . 
  yes winning would be worse in the medium run , but indeed i have little hope in the long run, 
  a lot of people . 
  a majority of humans are asian, 
  you 've got a pretty young mother tbf, 
  yeah yeah . 
  your fancy statistics ca n't stop me flushing my vegetables and eating all these eggs,
