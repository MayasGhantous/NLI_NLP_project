  like i said in another comment , both mugabe and chavez held similar referenda , lost , and admitted defeat . 
  zimbabwe and venezuela still ended up getting increasingly authoritarian . 
  a ` no ' vote might well lull the opposition and international community into a false sense of security while the akp steadily and less visibly strengthens their hold on power as they use the defeat as proof of their democratic credentials . 
  either way , turkey looks to be headed very clearly into a certain direction, 
  regarding the referendum i 'm cautiously optimistic ; as to the long term future of the country , far less so . 
  i can think of two countries which were at similar points on the path from democracy to dictatorship that held very similar referenda to extend the power of the state - zimbabwe in 2000 and venezuela in 2007 . 
  in both cases the ruling parties were authoritarian but ostensibly still democratic , and the leaders broadly popular . 
  both referenda were also narrowly defeated . 
  i feel like authoritarian democratic leaders are very good at using their cult of personality and repression to keep winning elections as candidates , but when the vote is regarding a more abstract extension of power , there is a higher turnout against . 
  in the end though , while mugabe and chavez accepted the results , they found other ways of bending the rules of democracy in their favor whole continuing to slide further towards authoritarianism . 
  some even say that accepting the defeat gave them the external legitimacy they continually leverage to maintain their position as a nominally democratic state, 
  i know , but i think a lot of that is just rooted in islamophobia, 
  i just wanted them to say it, 
  that sounds reasonable . 
  what do you reckon grandin 's reasoning was here , and how could she get it so wrong ? 
  i am right that she is pretty much the most respected authority on animal welfare in slaughter , or is she just the most well known ? 
  you know , i am interested in being proven wrong . 
  i 'm not an expert on the slightest about this stuff , so i have to rely on the best authority i can find . 
  if you have a strong argument against grandin , or any other objections to her approach , i 'd like to hear it, 
  well , i 'm sorry but i 'm going to trust the person with a phd in animal science over your completely unsubstantiated opinion if you do n't have anything to back that up, 
  it 's true , we euthanize them only by first stunning them with an electric shock to the throat before we slit open their torso to drain all the blood . 
  some people also ram an iron rod straight into the brain of the elderly . 
  i do n't know . 
  i linked to a page full of links to studies about animal suffering under ritual slaughter . 
  i only read and quoted from the summary at the top , but if you are interested in learning more i would recommend reading those studies in full, 
  the point is simply that they need not be mutually exclusive . 
  i do n't know .

  that 's one approach . 
  the other approach is to reconsider the ban on non-sedated slaughter , if it is proven that non-sedated and sedated practices can both be equally painful or cruel , which seems to be the case . 
  why not ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious, 
  i did n't start this whole ` muslims are not european ' thing , do n't ask me, 
  of course , which brings us back to the foremost expert on animal welfare and animal slaughter , who has outlined many designs for ` humane ' slaughter which are perfectly compatible with the spirit and the letter of most ritual demands . 
  but why ? 
  is n't the reasoning behind banning ritual slaughter that it should be banned ** because ** it 's inhumane ? 
  what is wrong with ritual slaughter if it 's not more inhumane than the non-ritual methods ? 
  so swiss people are n't european either ? 
   muslims and jews have to buy meat from other countries if they want that type of meat . 
  where the animal welfare standards are likely to be worse . 
  so what 's the net outcome ? 
  ban inhumane slaughter , not religious slaughter , and you would 've had a better result . 
  i wish it were so simple , but banning meat outright is n't going to work, 
  ok , i see what i 'm dealing with here . 
  what about jews ? 
  are they not europeans either ? 
   halal slaughter to be pointless in the context of european culture :p it 's not pointless when there are millions of europeans who will only eat halal meat . 
   how it 's less stressful for the animal i 'm not saying it is less stressful , i 'm saying it should n't necessarily be ** more ** stressful . 
  as the video which prompted these measures shows , non-halal slaughter can be truly horrific . 
  enforcing animal welfare standards should be done across the board . 
   the reason behind ritual slaughter halal/kosher was to prevent the eating of diseased animals i 've seen different reasons for the rituals . 
  some of them focus on respect for the animal/animal welfare , and others hypothesize about health concerns . 
   fuck it , religion was never rational . 
  agreed , but people will cling to rituals , so i think the most productive solution is to not ban something outright * because * it is religious , but to ban the practices which are inhumane , which leaves space for everyone to devise a method of slaughtering of their preference as long as it is legal and equally painful . 
   aka under perfect conditions . 
  i dont see that as being likley in the majority of slaughters . 
  i would prefer this be enforced than simply banning ritual slaughter outright . 
  the whole reason for ritual slaughter is supposed to be animal welfare , so they should be on board as long as the conditions are enforced across the industry . 
   if even 10 % of the electorate value animal welfare then parties will be forced to take a stance on it either way , people will be forced to actually engage with the issue , and ... 
  this is exactly what happened in this case , except the relevant [ party for the animals ] ( https://www.partyfortheanimals.nl/ ) which has been pushing for this initiative , and which more than doubled its seats to 5/150 in the recent election still only got 3.3 % of the vote . 
  in our fractured pr electoral and parliamentary system that 's enough to be a powerful voice to be reckoned with . 
  i might be biased because i 'm a member , but like you say , they have the arguments in favor , and there is increasing awareness , so i can only see the trend accelerating . 
  it did take the party more than a decade to go from being just an activist fringe party to their current state , where they have developed a coherent criticism of the global political economy as well as an ecological and animal welfare platform . 
  i hope other parties in other countries can replicate their model . 
  since she wrote the papers , i 'd say her summary is accurate, 
  i was waiting for that comment ... 
  thank you for preempting it . 
  there is some really interesting stuff happening around masculinities and ecology . 
  the movements have really matured from the mystical and the spiritual to the critical and investigative . 
  i 've seen the same happening in international relations , where feminist theories used to be all about the healing and nurturing force of women in ending conflict , which has shifted to a far more interesting critical turn which is spawning some really deep research . 
  https://www.animalrights.nl/animal-rights-filmt-mishandeling-van-varkens-slachthuis-tielt nsfl , but a great watch if you want to cut meat out of your life, 
  nonsense . 
  the same party that introduced this bill ( partij voor de dieren ) has introduced similar bills attempting to ban ritual slaughter numerous times . 
   natural part of evolution . 
  human activity has : - pushed extinction rates of animals and plants far above the long-term average . 
  the earth is on course to see 75 % of species become extinct in the next few centuries if current trends continue . 
  - increased levels of climate-warming co2 in the atmosphere at the fastest rate for 66m years , with fossil-fuel burning pushing levels from 280 parts per million before the industrial revolution to 400ppm and rising today . 
  - put so much plastic in our waterways and oceans that microplastic particles are now virtually ubiquitous , and plastics will likely leave identifiable fossil records for future generations to discover . 
  - doubled the nitrogen and phosphorous in our soils in the past century with fertiliser use . 
  this is likely to be the largest impact on the nitrogen cycle in 2.5 bn years . 
  - left a permanent layer of airborne particulates in sediment and glacial ice such as black carbon from fossil fuel burning . 
   slaughter 90 % of animals given to them ` slaughter ' is a ridiculous way to put it . 
  they 're a controversial organization , but i think it 's fair to hear their side of this statistic :  the statistics , nachminovitch said , have been twisted to demonize peta , focusing attention on the tragic symptom of euthanasia instead of the root of the problem : millions of unwanted animals who suffer neglect and cruelty . 
   `` you can count animals , but they 're not numbers , '' she said . 
  `` and there are many fates worse than euthanasia . ''  peta puts a high proportion of animals down , nachminovitch explains , because it ministers to those that many other shelters turn away , often because of the shelters ' '' no kill '' policies . 
   peta staff will drive more than 100 miles beyond norfolk , at any time and in any weather , to help animals that are gravely ill , infested with parasites or too aggressive ever to be adopted , she said . 
   and peta does n't care if the animal in need is a dog or a cat or a chicken or a rat , nachminovitch continued . 
  it does n't matter if the owner ca n't or wo n't pay for the services . 
  more than 500 of the animals it euthanized last year were brought in by owners who wanted to end their elderly or suffering pet 's pain , she said , but could n't afford the vet 's fee . 
  you 're putting it as if they just go about murdering the cute , healthy animals that people give them with the expectation of a long happy life . 
  that 's not what 's going on . 
   being praised by peta is n't exactly a plus ... 
  i 'm saying ** even ** peta , one of the most hardcore anti-slaughter organizations recognizes that she is an authority on animal suffering . 
  maybe a better approach would be to let her professional achievements speak for themselves : - b.a.

  i agree , but at the same time i wish this would be shown in full and uncensored on the news as long as these kinds of practices continue to exist . 
  it 's really horrifying , but people need to be made aware of this .
