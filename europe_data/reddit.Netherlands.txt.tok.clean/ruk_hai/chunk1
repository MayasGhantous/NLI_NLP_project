it does resemble it more than normal german . 
  i also think there are too many u 's , k 's and f 's though . 
  i do n't know what your native language is but no . 
  nog enough diphtongues , no sch 's at all , no ij , no ei , no ng , no ou , no au , no ou , no oo no aa , no ee , no ie , no uu , no ui ... 
  that 's a shame . 
  looks like the perfect place to take my snorkel and gopro and go exploring underwater . 
  can you swim in the water ? 
  middle east = where muslims live for a lot of people . 
  according to that graph , yes . 
  i 've fallen at least fifty times and i have never hit my head . 
  i 've also never worn a helmet . 
  my hardest fall was when i tried to ride my bike with my right hand on the left handgrip and vice versa . 
  i do n't know why i tried that . 
  in the netherlands bikes are public property and locks are just a challenge . 
  it 's actually the other way around . 
  stupid tourists walking on the cycling paths . 
  both parents have to be born in the netherlands for you to be considered autochtoon . 
  they do n't have to be dutch . 
  we call ours `` de randstad '', 
   you 'd get your take-out from your local snackbar , but you would n't necessarily want to sit down and eat there . 
  that depends on the snackbar . 
  most snackbars in my area are * way * more gezellig than any burger king or mcd i 've been to . 
  i did n't think he did all right at all to be honest . 
  it 's obvious he did no effort at all . 
  now he has shoehorned some places outside of the randstad in there but they are only stereotypes . 
  `` in de achterhoek people drink beer and in groningen there are earthquakes '' . 
  op , put some effort in this please ... 
  randstad arrogance strikes again . 
  i know that on a map they are from north to south in alphabetic order , which helps me remember which is which . 
  i know they used to be part of the soviet union but that they restored their independence after something called the singing revolution , during which people would get together in public and sing . 
  i know estonian is a uralic language and that it is the language closest related to finnish . 
  latvian and lithuanian are baltic languages . 
  i know all three use the euro and are part of the eu and nato . 
  i know the baltics get their name from the baltic sea and not the other way around , although i do n't remember what it means . 
  that 's it i think . 
  you 're just trying to get your hands on my bike again , are n't you ? 
  i got it [ from here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_lions_in_europe ), 
  lions used to roam greece , the balkans and southern russia , and possibly hungary , italy , southern france , spain and portugal . 
  it 's not inconceivable that they heard of them in stories and legends . 
  as long as they keep their hands off our bitterballen . 
  you do n't get it , he did n't have the car * he wanted * . 
   the joy of playing dutch schlager music in a 50km long traffic jam somewhere between koblenz and m\u00fcnchen really is an acquired taste . 
  not so much `` acquired '' as `` genetically inherited '' . 
   without the involvement of bicycles i understand what all of those words mean but this phrase makes no sense to me at all . 
  literally nobody goes south of the rivers if they can avoid it . 
  and it * is * sketchy as fuck . 
  really ? 
  that 's a thing ? 
  i had n't heard that one before . 
  what 's the `` evidence '' ? 
  tell me more . 
  it was sung by the original writer , herman van veen , who translated it into german himself as well . 
  i thought i was in / r/worldnews , i carelessly read over the `` in europe '' part of your post . 
  i thought this was / r/worldnews . 
  not really though . 
  they are almost a thousand euros . 
  here in colombia i pay over three times the amount for a simple iphone charger as i would back home . 
  import tariffs in brazil and other countries are way higher because of their isolationist policies . 
  tech costs far from `` roughly the same '' everywere . 
  google the price of an xbox in brazil . 
  yep , i 've heard it said that the dutch work the least hours on average of any eu country but still are amongst the most productive , for example . 
  gronings is dutch according to dutch law . 
  the only dialect that has special status is limburgs if i am not mistaken , which is a local language . 
  the rest are just seen as dialects . 
   only the elderly speak mainly in dialect , mass media and school have eradicated dialect usage i grew up in rural groningen and that is bs . 
   i have never ever traveled to some place in this country where the locals spoke in `` incomprehensable gibberish '' on the street like some redditors here claim they have . 
  not sure which country they live in ... let me guess , you 're from the randstad and only visit cities ? 
  try a small village next time . 
  i worked as a street promotor for a year and have visited small cities all over the northern three provinces , as well as some in overijssel , gelderland and flevoland and i can tell you that there are many , many people who speak in very strong dialect in their daily lives . 
  i learned it from my linguistics professor . 
  [ more than that ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/languages_benelux.png ), 
  you 've probably never spoke to someone who spoke pure dialect then . 
  tell me how much you understand of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o08ksqoygjo ) or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svt8a2l3epu ) ( both grunnegs plat ), 
  [ see here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/languages_benelux.png ), 
  [ most dialects per km ^ 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/languages_benelux.png ), 
  quite reminds me of [ escobar 's hippos ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27905743 ), 
  you say that like it is a bad thing . 
  i heard the same thing about donald duck comics . 
  are n't most immigrants that come from turkey to western europe kurds ? 
  that 's what i heard , at least . 
  '' * i do n't have a drinking problem , except for when i ca n't get a drink . 
  * '' - tom waits, 
  delirium tremens or rochefort . 
  both belgian . 
   that 's what you do n't seem to get . 
  which is why i asked . 
   in france it 's a non-issue . 
  but is it a non-issue because people do n't know or because people do n't care ? 
  or maybe a bit of both , the not knowing as a result of not caring ? 
  i 'm not judging here , it 's just that i 'm a student of languages so i 'm curious as to what the general perception towards these minority languages is . 
  government grants + loans + parents ' help ( + living on a diet of beer and bread ) . 
  question though : did you not know that it was an issue , or did you know about it and simply not care ? 
  in the netherlands frisian , low saxon and limburgish are on the decline too iirc , but there are still quite a few speakers relative to total population . 
  low saxon and limburgish do n't even have official language status . 
  i read about this as well . 
  youth unemployment numbers for the netherlands are massively skewed because a significant amount of young people work only part time jobs with low wages and little hours . 
  same in the netherlands . 
  18/19 is normal . 
  20/21 is okay but people will start to ask you about why you are still living with your parents . 
  22 + and you will get weird looks .
