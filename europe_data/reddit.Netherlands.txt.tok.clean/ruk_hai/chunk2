  [ meanwhile in the netherlands ... ] ( http://www.odditycentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/geldrop-lotr.jpg ), 
  ( `` ca n't argue about taste ! '' ), 
  the younger generations seem to hear so often on the internet that our language sounds ugly that they regurgitate this statement and seem to * hate * dutch . 
  according to my linguistics prof this is bullshit though since you can never objectively judge how pretty/ugly your own native tongue sounds since you spoke it since you were a baby . 
  according to my prof the reason dutch people do n't like the sound of the language is only because they hear it from others that dutch is ugly and then start to belief it . 
  and lekker !, 
  the / r/askhistorians one is the best subreddit april fools joke i have seen so far . 
  as mentioned elsewhere in this thread they are china 's buddy in the americas . 
  groningen is not part of holland either . 
  that 's exactly my point . 
   also , it 's really nitpicking . 
  official names are one thing . 
  actual names in usage are another . 
   you do n't see germans upset about being called allemagne or germany however do n't you think a bavarian would get upset if you called him a berliner ? 
  ( or not even upset but rather politely correct you , which is what most non-hollanders do anyway ) this is mainly the problem . 
  people from rural areas feel they are relegated to irrelevant people , not even deserving of an own name . 
  they get referred to by the name of a region that is the richest and most influential area . 
  there are already many annoyances between the randstad and the north , for example , so referring to a groninger as a hollander will only add fuel to the fire . 
  they do n't get annoyed that you use a different name than we do for the country , they get annoyed because you use the name of a different region who have historically been seen as oppressing the poor farmers . 
  the attitude of many hollanders `` do n't complain , you are irrelevant anyway , people only care about holland , you guys are annoying , etc. '', 
  is n't really helping either . 
  see also [ this article ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/de-kloof-met-de-randstad-is-niet-meer-te-dichten~a3780161/ ) if you speak duch . 
  a true dutchman right here . 
  groningen is a german colony every other weekend . 
  also the ikea in groningen has been annexed permanently . 
  both people that died were dutch military personnel . 
  it 's a checheya not a fez , 
  even if they did n't have the nuclear device i was talking about north korea 's `` dad '' , china . 
  best korea is the kid sitting in the corner eating glue and killing ants with a magnifying glass , thinking he 's the best because that 's what his daddy keeps telling him . 
  the other kids also acts like he 's cool because his daddy is a professional wrestler ( with nukes ) . 
  actually nato is the cool kids club . 
  russia is like the kid who should be cool but had a horrible childhood which is why he is an asshole and joins the outcasts group . 
  nato is desperately trying to `` safe '' russia by being nice to him and letting him get away with stuff while in actuality all he deserves is to be punched in the face . 
  png can beat it at over 850 , but those are n't official languages . 
  yeah, 
  i found it stunning how easy i was able to tell wether they were dutch or belgian just by their accent when speaking in english . 
  bolivia with 36 official languages wins . 
  everyone thinks we 're all stoners, 
  the jury is still out on it being wild . 
  but in those languages i assume you will conjugate to plural in the verb . 
  in english the verb conjugation for you singular and you plural is identical . 
  maybe ask / r/neology if they can come up with something cool . 
   love how we speak of it as `` we '' as if we were the bosses of `` the english language '' are n't we ? 
  i would say the collective of people who speak english are the people who decide what the english language is like , and since we speak english we are a part of that . 
   does it work the same way in dutch ? 
  nope . 
  in fact , the lack of a plural `` you '' in english is one of the things that annoy me most when speaking in english . 
  i also see your point , but at the moment it seems to me that `` they '' is the best option we have . 
   it can be male/female , singular/plural ... that 's the point of a neuter pronoun , is n't it ? 
  which is , of course , completely relevant in / r/europe . 
  it 's easy to get drugs pretty much anywhere if you know who to ask . 
  the netherlands is not too expensive if you steer clear of amsterdam and the biking infrastructure is second to none . 
  the first example that comes to mind is [ the videoclip for the song kids by mgmt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe4ek4hspki ) , and i am sure there are others . 
  i know who he is and i know about some books he wrote . 
  i also know he is one people [ most often misquoted on the internet ] ( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/mark_twain#disputed ) ( i.e. 
  * `` he who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster . 
  and when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you . 
  '' * was said by nietzsche ) he has very little relevance in the european literary world and is n't very popular in europe as far as i know although i 'm sure people still appreciate him for being a great writer . 
  anything by de jeugd van tegenwoordig is always fun . 
  the netherlands has a pretty good hiphop scene . 
  check out / r/dutchhiphop, 
  to show how archaic these are : i 've never used any of them . 
  how is the netherlands closer to italy and portugal culturally than it is to denmark and germany ? 
  blablacar , hitchhiking or trains/bus would be the cheapest . 
  i would check ryanair for your destinations just in case , they often fly on small airports rather than big ones . 
  no , i do n't . 
  i think the weather in our two countries is quite similar , safe for the fact that my country is completely flat and so wind has free play . 
  brits whine a lot about how bad their weather is though . 
  it is uncommon for young people to have a car , especially when living in a city . 
  families with children usually have one or two cars ( more often one than two ) . 
  in cities most trips are done by bike . 
  i 'm dutch but i live in bogot\u00e1 . 
  most people i told that i was moving to colombia brought up the usual stereotypes . 
  drugs , violence , poverty , hot girls , dancing , parties , etc. 
  the truth is that europe is quite ignorant about south america . 
  brazil is speedos , breast implants , hot girls and beaches . 
  argentina is our queen but that 's pretty much where that stops . 
  suriname is our ex colony and almost as many surinamese people live in the netherlands than in suriname . 
  that 's pretty much all dutch people think about south america , i think . 
  in the netherlands when it 's cold weather and people are ice skating on the canals you can find koek-en-zopie stands everywhere . 
  originally ( [ 19th century ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/andreas_schelfhout_-_winterlandschap.jpg ) and [ another ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/charles_leickert_%28brussels_1816-1907_mainz_-_winter_scene_1892.jpg ) ) these stands sold a warm mixture of [ bock beer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bock ) , rum , eggs , cinnamon and cloves called `` zopie '' . 
  nowadays they sell things such as hot chocolate , snert , [ gevulde koek ] ( https://www.google.com.co/search?q=gevulde+koek&amp;safe=off&amp;es_sm=119&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=fc8wvdqyjmzzsaxh6ohgcg&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=649 ) and mulled wine . 
  snert is a thick , nutritious , and * very * delicious pea soup . 
  my own personal favourite dish from the dutch kitchen . 
  i think mostly people in europe care less about americans than americans think we do . 
  most people do n't give a shit . 
  well , i hate to brag but [ the netherlands is the best place to grow up as a child ] ( http://www.unicef-irc.org/report-card-11/ ) , so yay us !, 
  if i had to choose another i would choose france i think . 
  i think mostly the people are against * illegal * immigration . 
  i 'm personally not a fan of tours like the one you posted but i guess it 's a matter of taste . 
  i do n't think you 'll need to `` ease into traveling '' . 
  i 've traveled a bit myself and it comes quite natural . 
  i think you 'll be fine doing the trip all by the two of you and i would personally prefer to do it like that . 
  it gives you more freedom to decide what to do . 
  prague is an amazing city but i think budapest may also be a cool alternative . 
  in poland krakow is my favourite city . 
  it is a vibrant student city with a very friendly and fun atmosphere . 
  i also think in poland you should pay a visit to auschwitz . 
  it will not be a fun day out but i think it 's a place everyone should visit once in their lives . 
  you should check out / r/travel , they have a lot of threads on these countries and travel in europe in general .
