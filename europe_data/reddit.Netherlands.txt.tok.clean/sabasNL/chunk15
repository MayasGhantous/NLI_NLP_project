  that things did n't go as well for the native population or colonists is not important ; that 's the whole idea of exploitation colonialism . 
  colonialism can be great for the colonisers though !, 
  ah yes , you 're right !, 
  i 've been there for a long time already , even submitted a few comics  [ my ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2ld6va/meinem_himmel/ ) [ three ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2s3cq4/a_sponsored_message_regarding_the_natos/ ) [ favourites ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2r7rmf/holland/ ), 
  shut it up you fotze und help me carry dies b\u00f6rden . 
  you can trink your tea l\u00e4ter . 
  i mightz even join you . 
  we 're gon na teach the world some civilisation , culture and grand cuisine !, 
  that seriously spooked me, 
   [ dahn-keh meh-rkel ] pronouce englishly should n't that be [ dahn-kuh mehr-kul ] ? 
  `` u '' as in `` curve '', 
  i already wondered why the prices were supposedly that high . 
  never heard of major price rises as a result from adopting the euro either . 
  yeah , that sounds very likely . 
  i do n't think the european commission will push any of its member states to join any time soon . 
  that would just anger the public . 
   if a bag of chips used to cost 1.50 ltl it costs 1.50 $ now , it 's ridiculous . 
  that 's a pretty high price even for eu standards . 
  that 's the same price you 'll pay in western and northern europe , whereas its cheaper in southern , central and eastern europe . 
  sweden is obliged to join eventually per the maastricht treaty . 
  i too hope the current eurozone gets centralised more before additional members join . 
  it 's a mess currently . 
  croatia has n't joined the eurozone yet . 
  it has n't been approved by the ecb ( deficit and debt too high , not a member of the erm ii ) . 
  i think you misunderstood the question . 
  please give independence to north luxembourg , you southern oppressor !, 
  melted real cheese  `` cheese '' curds garlic sauce ( and optionally sambal or chili sauce )  gravy, 
  fries , sauce , cheese and meat, 
  [ i beg to differ !, 
  yes !, 
  as you 'd expect , they usually serve things like fries , hamburgers , onion rings , butter corn . 
  that 's the only american food you 'll find outside of american fast food chains like domino 's / nyp and mcd/bk/kfc . 
  sometimes these restaurants have a 60 's american diner theme , but i 'd say most restaurants do n't have decor except for some posters on the wall and some music . 
  mexican and cuban food is on the rise in the netherlands ( though spanish cuisine has been going strong for decades now ) , and there 's a dutch tex-mex chain that will soon get competition from newcomer taco bell . 
  we do n't know anything about canadian food besides poutine , which we do n't want because we have a superior alternative : the * kapsalon * . 
  gives a whole other meaning to `` black mountain '' , haha, 
  one cup of coffee , dick, 
  electric ovens are the standard here , furnaces can be gas or electric , the latter of which is becoming increasingly popular . 
  i prefer gas , though . 
  it 's easier for me to control and most households are connected to gas . 
  gas ovens are a thing for restaurants . 
  that 's a quite depressing thought to have during a visit to a gay bar 's bathroom . 
  hmm , i do know some airlines like klm offer a separate insurance just for that when you buy a ticket . 
  should be cheaper than a regular travel insurance . 
  in the netherlands , biking paths and public transport are great when only travelling within your city . 
  so for students like me , that 's the way to go . 
  even though a lot of youth can afford a car if they want to ; most teens / students also get a driving license years before they actually want to own a car . 
  i do borrow a friend with a car sometimes for hauling furniture and the like , but for all other purposes , my bike is much cheaper and more convenient . 
  only doing groceries is a bit of a hassle , i got proper bicycle bags for that . 
  it should be said that some insurances are pretty much useless , including * in many cases * travel insurance , as a regular health insurance and contents insurance will already cover all your travel needs . 
  hmm , fair enough . 
  i still think it 's a bit outdated , but the way you put it , it makes sense . 
  indeed . 
  northern limburg is no different from eastern brabant and southern gelderland , unlike southern limburg which really has its own character , even more so than friesland in my opinion . 
  flevoland being let of the east , zeeland of the west . 
  it does n't make sense in a cultural , economic or social way . 
  interesting . 
  the dutch system makes no sense in any way whatsoever , though . 
  must have been geographically determined . 
  i would divide the netherlands like this , based on economical and social values : west / randstad : noord-holland , zuid-holland , utrecht and flevoland . 
  south east / dutch burgundy : southern half of limburg east : gelderland , overijssel north : friesland , groningen , drenthe you could argue gelderland should culturally be part of the south , but economically they belong with overijssel , being more peripheral with a couple large cities . 
  to answer op 's question , i think the netherlands could have 3 `` superprovinces '' if we wanted to : westland / randstad ( nh , zh , ut , fl ) zuidland / greater brabantstad ( zl , nb , lb , gl ) noord ( ov , dr , fr , dr ), 
  they always do so , as is required , and they are insured for that . 
  in addition to what others have said , and this might sound obvious but there are people who do n't think this through , always carry your papers with you when travelling . 
  physical , not digital , and original papers , not photocopies . 
  keep your passport , visa and acceptance letter on your person . 
  make sure you do n't lose it , do not keep it in your luggage . 
  and since you 're hitchhiking , make sure you go through customs when travelling into or out of the schengen zone - such as the uk . 
  stick to the official routes if possible , such as the ferry services and eurotunnel in the case of the uk . 
  antartica is quite chilly though . 
  and you have to wear sunglasses at all times . 
  a bit like switzerland , but with less guns . 
  most countries set it as a high risk for 48 hours after the attacks . 
  there was a lot of chaos and the threat of more attacks , but now there is no reason to believe paris is any more dangerous than any other city . 
  in fact , it might be even safer now . 
  we 're the safest continent in the world . 
  do n't cancel anything . 
  i did n't know that , thanks !, 
   i 'm american but have eu citizenship because my father is from ireland . 
  that does not make you an eu citizen . 
  if you are an american and do not have a double nationality , you are entitled to a residence and/or work permit , you are not an eu citizen . 
  however , you said you are waiting for your irish passport , so i assume you have the irish nationality . 
  if not , the above applies . 
  there is no other document you could use instead of your irish passport , but you could try contacting the irish embassy . 
  you need a citation for something that is common knowledge , a fact , not a political opinion ? 
  [ very ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c125.html ) | [ well ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicrefugee.asp ) | [ four ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/economic_refugee ) | [ citations ] ( http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/economic-refugee.html ) what i 'm saying is n't `` pure utter bullshit '' , it 's something that is n't what you were thinking about and still are n't . 
  you seem to think that all tens of thousands of people who come to europe by boat , by truck or on foot are refugees who fear for their lives . 
  at least you sound like you do n't know of any other migrant waves other than those from , say , syria . 
  well , you 're completely wrong . 
  [ economic migrants from the balkans and asia ] ( http://frontex.europa.eu/trends-and-routes/western-balkan-route/ ) have been a problem of the last couple of years , [ whereas those from northern africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/african_immigration_to_europe ) have been a problem for decades . 
  not every migrant to europe is a refugee of war . 
  not every migrant comes to europe because they fear for their lives . 
  not every migrant is a refugee , and thus not every migrant deserves the preferential treatment and protection _ real _ refugees do . 
  economic migrants are either deported back ( balkans especially ) or declared illegals and left to roam the streets until they co-operate with the authorities and are deported . 
  undesirable ? 
  most definitely . 
  justified ? 
  yes , in my opinion . 
  because those people often pretend to be refugees , thus receiving food , shelter and medical care that they do n't need or deserve . 
  actual refugees do need those , and deserve those , both from an ethical point of view and by international conventions .
