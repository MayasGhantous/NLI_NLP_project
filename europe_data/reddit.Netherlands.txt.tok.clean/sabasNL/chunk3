   try to run away with your assets to evade the new law ? 
  not if the state does n't want you to . 
  the state does n't want you to , but it 's powerless , and frankly , politicians do n't care . 
  [ tax havens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_haven ) , [ shelf corporations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shelf_corporation ) , this is all happening on a large scale right now . 
   try to set up banks abroad to cater to the u.s. market ? 
  sorry , if you want to do business in the u.s. you 're going to have to follow our laws . 
  again , plain wrong . 
  take the two biggest banks of the us . 
  out of my head , that should be citi group and bank of new york mellon . 
  both have their headquarters in new york city , manhattan . 
  operational offices ? 
  ireland . 
  financial support ? 
  india . 
  foreign currencies transactions ? 
  switzerland . 
  almost everything these banks handle - we 're talking the really , really big players here , the huge corporations we all know - is not handled in the us , but elsewhere in the world . 
  the only thing that makes these banks american is their top-level employees and their headquarters . 
  oh right , and the profits , they store those in the us ... after using aforementioned tricks , because all three countries mentioned above happily provide benefits to the banks in exchange for their labour and tax . 
  the us government does too , but it does n't go as far as these nations , and therefore the banks happily locate their offices elsewhere . 
  in economics , there is a law for this very scenario . 
  i 'm sorry but i ca n't recall the name right now , but it basically says that if a player ( e.g. 
  a bank ) has better ( more profitable ) options within reasonable parameters ( good location , well-educated people , speaking the right language , etc. 
  ) , then the player will choose for those options instead . 
  therefore , tax haven ireland is very attractive for companies that think the us , uk , germany and france too expensive . 
   you could even outlaw the various kinds of financial gambling that caused the problems entirely and restrict banks to basic savings and loan activities to individual and business customers . 
  no speculation allowed . 
  with a stroke it 'd essentially eliminate the risk of another banking collapse . 
  no , that 's nonsense . 
  capitalism , lesson one : invest money , make money , turn a profit . 
  banks without speculation are banks without their main source of income . 
  banks that will not be able to give out interests . 
  banks that will not be able to give you loans and insurances , because guess what ? 
  that is speculation too . 
  these banks will all cease to exist . 
  and with them , your savings , your house , perhaps your car , maybe your family . 
  healthcare ? 
  forget about it . 
  salary ? 
  hah , that 's a good joke . 
  you 're now bankrupt , homeless and hungry . 
  but perhaps even worse , all those banks you bankrupted , also had employees and clients depending on them for their income , and those are now bankrupt , homeless and hungry too . 
  we all are . 
  and nobody 's running the soup kitchen now . 
   law is fucking powerful and very very scary . 
  do n't underestimate it just because you 're accustomed to seeing it not actually used . 
  the question is usually not ` can law do that ? 
  ' , it 's `` is that the best public policy option ? ', 
  and then ` is there the political will to do that ? ' . 
  ** conclusion ** : well , we partially agree on one thing then . 
  but our views on what 's feasible as far as politics go could n't be more different . 
  i think you overestimate the willingness of the political system to put reforms into effect that hurt the political system itself , not to mention the state , the economy , the businesses and last and sadly least , the people . 
  i think you 're being a bit naive when you make such claims without thinking through what the effects of such bold decisions would make . 
  now , please do n't get me wrong . 
  i think banks are doing terrible things , i am absolutely against self-enrichment at the cost of employees , i think governments should have more oversight and control and i am a sworn protector of social care provided by the state . 
  but beheading the banks is like shooting yourself in the foot . 
  you 're , give or take , 6 centuries too late with that scenario . 
  the world is literally enslaved by gold , and there does n't seem to be a way back . 
  likewise , the problem with lenin was that his plans were good on paper and wanted nothing but the best for the people , but in the real world , fairy tales do n't work . 
  and yes , that goes for both the communist utopia and a world without greedy banks taking huge risks . 
  however , i 'll give you this : i have no idea how to solve the problem around these banks . 
  but i do think that anyone proclaiming otherwise is talking out of his ass , a madman , or a genius the likes of which we have not yet seen on this earth . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** i think that 's a bit naive to say , because it would have many negative effects in reality . 
  however , i 'm not saying i have a better idea , because frankly , i do n't believe anyone does , or * can * for that matter . 
  sorry for the huge wall of text , 
  that sounds nice on paper , but all that means is that banks will screw consumers and businesses alike . 
  or maybe even far , far worse than that . 
  less loans given out , even lower interest rates , higher transaction fees , more restricted and more expensive insurances , etc. 
  banks have caused huge problems over the last few years , but let 's not be so naive to think that we can `` punish '' the banks or keep them on a leash . 
  it 's easier to take on a nation 's government than to take on a nation 's financial circle . 
  that might sound ridiculous , but we have more than enough examples . 
  i think luxembourg is a nice one ; 10 % of the employed work for banks , 25 % of the gni comes from banks . 
  luxembourg has such a success replacing its metal industry with financial businesses due to the government policies of bank secrets and low taxes . 
  now to get to the point : what will the banks do if the luxembourgish government does a full 180 and scraps these benefits ? 
  they 'll likely move to other countries with special arrangements , such as iceland , ireland , the netherlands , malta and switzerland . 
  a huge loss for luxembourg . 
  the effects would be even worse in the bigger economies . 
  germany ? 
  the euro would take a huge hit . 
  international transactions would collapse . 
  international stock prices fall dramatically . 
  china ? 
  international supply chains break down . 
  globalisation has had many advantages , but the lack of oversight and control in the financial world is a huge problem . 
  fact is that nobody really knows what to do about it , and nobody knows what will happen when things go horribly wrong . 
  not to forget he 's a knight and heavy metal vocalist as well . 
  such a beautiful voice . 
  i could listen to it all day . 
  napoleon also dreamt of a united states of europe after his conquests were complete . 
  i wonder how it would 've looked like if he succeeded . 
  i would agree that transeuropean wars are not the images you want on your transeuropean euro coins . 
  then why do n't you come back ? 
  filthy seperatists :(, 
  besides , most off-spring of immigrants have only a small amount of things in common with the people their ancestors originate from , pretty much limited to food and perhaps the language . 
  if those were the criteria for to be of a foreign nationality , than i might as well apply for a uk and italian passport . 
  in the netherlands , we actually tend to mean it when we ask `` how are you ? '' . 
  i just ca n't stand smalltalk in english , it 's horrible . 
  `` hey '' `` hey '' `` sup ? '', 
  `` fine , you ? '', 
  ... a place where there is n't * anything * to complain about ?
