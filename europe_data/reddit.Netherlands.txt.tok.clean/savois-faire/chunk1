there is also that . 
  the politicians just live here because they work here though . 
  it 's a bit of a toss-up between the flemish and the germans i think . 
  they 're each like us in different ways . 
  third largest city in the country . 
  seat of the government , parliament and the monarch . 
  amsterdam 's just a big tourist trap , the hague is where it all happens , 
  a worthy contender , i would say . 
  there was one couple who actually traveled from the hague to brussels in an attempt to carry out an [ attack on the european commission building ] ( http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1040/den-haag/article/detail/3752266/2014/09/22/explosieven-gevonden-in-woning-nederlands-jihad-stel.dhtml ) . 
  they were arrested at zaventem . 
  i was pretty amazed to hear the recidivism rates . 
  20 % recidivism in norway , like 25 % in sweden . 
  i do n't even know the rates for the netherlands , but i doubt they 're as low as that . 
  67,5 % percent in the us . . just insane . 
  according to the television database the `` religion '' episode aired 2014-11-04 . 
  which was two days ago . 
  ca n't seem to find a download for it though ... 
  i 'd very much like to watch the full episode as well . 
  [ link for the lazy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfesz812q1i ) , the episode op 's article refers to is from the same series , yes . 
  it 's all from the series `` the norden '' , in which they show americans why the world doubles over in laughter every time americans claim `` america 's number one !, 
  '' , by showing them how things are done in scandinavia . 
  reddit formatting does n't work in submissions , only in comments . 
  my city , the hague , is known as the international city of peace and justice , and as europe 's main breeding ground for islamic radicals . 
  swings and roundabouts , as the british say . 
  could n't you just hear ode to joy playing in your head as you read that ? 
   no longer perceived to be the ` land of the free ''' since about the 1970s . 
  at this point , is anyone still surprised by this ? 
  wetten das is fantastic . 
  i have some family in germany and they 're all nuts for it . 
   i stopped reading your garbage when you said israel is not at war with gaza , which it is at war with hamas which runs gaza . 
  i suggest reading it anyway . 
  you might learn something . 
  like how the vast majority of people israel kills are * nothing * to do with hamas . 
   also , israel indiscriminately killing civilians is an entirely stupid way of seeing the conflict . 
  it 's exactly what is going on . 
  hamas fires missiles ; which is pointless because they could never penetrate the dome . 
  israel reacts by shelling wherever they suspect hamas people are hiding , no matter how many civilians they know will be killed in the process . 
  that is known as killing indiscriminately . 
  they carry out air-raids that last multiple days in which roughly 80 % of the people they kill are innocent civilians . 
  they do n't stop doing carrying out these air raids after learning it mostly kills innocents , instead they keep doing it , as they do n't much care about killing gazan civilians . 
   lol using electronic infitada as your source ... ohh jeeze ... 
  i love how you never address the actual points . 
  israeli member of parliament openly calls for palestinian genocide ? 
  well i do n't trust that source so i 'm not even going to consider it . 
  well , you can get the same information from any number of sources : press tv for example : http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/07/16/371556/israel-must-kill-all-palestinian-mothers/ or the independent if you prefer : http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/why-im-on-the-brink-of-burning-my-israeli-passport-9600165.html even dissident voice : http://dissidentvoice.org/2014/07/israeli-mp-mothers-of-all-palestinians-must-be-killed/ or dtt : http://defendingthetruth.com/current-events/41202-israel-mp-mothers-all-palestinians-must-killed.html or , if you prefer , al-alam : http://en.alalam.ir/news/1612199 or anywhere really , because it 's fact . 
  you could simply go to the israeli mp 's facebook and read the call for genocide there . 
  meh . . it was allright . 
   the ihh sponsored flotilla were not palestinian civilians . 
  i think you are confused . 
  i did n't say they were palestinian civilians , did i ? 
  i said the vast majority of people they kill in gaza are civilians , which is a fact . 
  i do n't think i 'm the one who 's confused here . 
   also , if you are talking about civilian/militant ration , the same ratio applies to the u.s in afghanistan and iraq . 
  civilians die in war . . thats a newsflash for you . 
  the fact that civilians die in a war is n't a newsflash for anyone , feel free to dial back the condescension a bit , mate . 
  what is apparently news to you is the fact that israel is not at war with gaza . 
  they are indiscriminately killing people in gaza , which is one of the most densely populated regions on the planet , largely populated by refugees from other areas , in the hopes of killing the small number of hamas fighters there in the process . 
  they are using the actions of the hamas militants ( who , by the way , ca n't touch israel no matter how hard they try , and israel knows it . 
  israel has a better missile-defense system than the fucking south korean border ) to justify shelling the shit out of a majority civilian and refugee area , killing thousands of innocent civilians who have no part in the israel-hamas conflict . 
  well , they had no part in it until the idf took it upon themselves to decide that they were to die , as part of the conflict . 
  while hamas is pointlessly firing missiles at the impenetrable dome , killing literally zero israeli 's , top israeli politicians are openly discussing the most effective way of `` eradicating the palestinian people '' ( which , of course , the western media has very coincidentally not reported on at all ) . 
  if you actually follow israeli politics you quickly learn just how the israeli leadership views the palestinian civilians ( the phrase `` subhuman '' gets thrown around in israeli politics in unbelievable numbers ) . 
  http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/israeli-lawmakers-call-genocide-palestinians-gets-thousands-facebook-likes `` a day before palestinian teenager muhammad abu khudair was kidnapped and burned alive allegedly by six israeli jewish youths , israeli lawmaker ayelet shaked published on facebook a call for genocide of the palestinians . 
  it is a call for genocide because it declares that `` the entire palestinian people is the enemy '' and justifies its destruction , `` including its elderly and its women , its cities and its villages , its property and its infrastructure . '' it is a call for genocide because it calls for the slaughter of palestinian mothers who give birth to `` little snakes . '' if shaked 's post does not meet the legal definition of a call for genocide then nothing does . '', 
  that 's a member of the israeli parliament , calling for the genocide of the palestinian people . 
  not hamas fighters or their affiliates , any and all palestinians , civilian and otherwise . 
  it 's a call to genocide , not from some maniac but from a top israeli politician and a member of parliament . 
  but let 's all keep giving unwavering support to israel as they kill thousands upon thousands of innocent people who are nothing to do with the conflict , because a non-israeli life `` is n't worth worrying over '' , according to the leaders of the idf . 
   i am sure in the ohh so peaceful netherlands , you never have to deal with anything being a small nation and all . 
  well , we 're twice as big a nation as israel is . . 
  in a lot of small towns here people can open up for business on sundays and holidays if they choose to , but they have to pay their employees anywhere from 150 % to 200 % salary , and they ca n't force their employees to work sundays if they do n't want to , basically they ca n't be contractually obliged to work on sunday . 
  i used to work at my local supermarket , and whenever we woud soon be open on a sunday the boss would put up a sheet in the cafeteria where you could write down your name if you were willing to work sunday , and you 'd get payed double . 
  my name was always top of the list  i 'll happily take a 200 % pay-out over a sunday off , there 's nothing to do on sunday anyway . 
   the ihh group is hardly a bunch of '' civilians '' however , on average roughly 77 % of the people they indiscriminately kill in gaza * are * civilians . 
  edit : you can downvote it , but you ca n't deny it . 
  also , if you think i 'm a ` leftist ' for acknowledging the fact that israel behaves like a sociopathic bully , then you 're a fool to begin with . 
  i love that i do n't have to remind myself to get extra groceries on saturday . 
  in fact , i do most of my week 's shopping on sunday , because i have nothing else to do all day . 
  it 's my one day off , so i like to go shopping . 
  everything else he 's put out i hated to varying degrees , but my god those two films were fantastic . 
   not surprised . 
  the eu is such a failure since the crash . 
  so because the eu is such a `` failure '' they moved from one part of the eu , to a different part of the eu ? 
  he 's only ever really had two , as far as i can tell . 
  `` snatch '' and `` lock , stock '' . 
  sadly , `` israel kills without consequences '' is so common it 's not really news anymore . 
  it just seems to be going from bad to worse . 
  seems about right . 
  burning a salmond effigy seems a bit of a silly move considering the social climate . 
  in lewes they always burn effigies of various political leaders . 
  they did david cameron , nick clegg and margaret thatcher before , this year they had alex salmond , vladimir putin and a few others . 
  wow , never heard of the guy before but it sounds like he was a pretty bad-ass dude . 
   `` there is reason to suppose that the artist 's death is of a criminal character , '' said one law enforcement source . 
  heart-attacks are also rarely accompanied by `` pools of blood '' . 
  paul nuttall is in no way to be taken seriously . 
  sauli niinisto is a man people need to listen to more . 
  rferl is an excellent source . 
  they have some great articles on the situation in ukraine . 
  i was reading [ this one ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-separatist-courts-death-sentences/26674118.html ) on there this morning , quite chilling . 
  ah yeah , those are a bit more effective than our ones i would think .
