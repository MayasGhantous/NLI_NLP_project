  the qatar wc on the other hand . . 
  well , i have n't watched any in a few years , but i very much enjoyed `` lola rennt '' , `` goodbye lenin '' , `` das leben der anderen '' , `` die welle '' . 
  stuff like that . 
  obviously , classics like `` der untergang '' or `` das boot '' are also great . 
  good sign , although you do have to be careful with those energy drinks . 
  one thing another user mentioned is german films ( germany has a relatively big film industry , and they make a lot of great films ) . 
  also , / r/languagelearning is a great little sub with a very helpful community . 
  i check in there every now and again if i need to brush up on a language before a trip or something like that . 
  lol , reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohrdh0tdtke ) . 
  it 's a massive oversimplification of the situation , in which the greeks are the unfortunate innocent victims who did nothing wrong while the evil overlords snicker and laugh from their ivory towers . 
  nobody is happy about the situation , and it 's not like the greeks are entirely without blame in the matter . 
  it would be better if all sides stopped engaging in discourse of this level . 
  it sounds a lot better than `` the poorest duchy in the world '' though . 
  also , england still has some [ duchies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_cornwall ) , although i 'm guessing you probably meant ones that are still countries of their own . 
   last autumn the netherlands was faced with an extra payment of $ 642m because the economy had grown more strongly than forecast . 
  your economy is doing much better than we expected , congratulations !, 
  now hand it over . . ( obviously , i 'm being facetious ), 
  that actually looks pretty bad . 
  could spell disaster , economically speaking . 
  as someone with a lot of friends in turkey , the development of the turkish government the past few years and the way it seems to be continuing really scares me . 
  it really is heartbreaking to hear our supposed representatives praising the war on drugs as a great thing that needs to be adapted here . 
  while countries like portugal and the us let common sense push them forward we are letting paranoia and lobbyists drag us backwards . 
  well , the threats of shutting down the coffeeshops , the shady affairs of * certain * ministers , the trying to fix mayoral elections , the cracking down on expenses while claiming shitloads , etc. 
  i 'm just not a fan , is all . 
  if it helps , our current government is doing everything it can to bring us back into the 17th century . . 
  why not both ? 
  it 's always a bit of a weird moment when i 'm reminded that germany does n't have gay marriage yet . 
  i just expect more of them i guess . 
  it 's like when you 're reminded that beck is a scientologist , it just seems off . . 
  sanity and reason prevailed . 
  congratulations to the irish . 
  hardly . 
  had it not been for reddit i probably would have been completely unaware it was happening . 
  that being said , good luck to the irish , i hope sanity and reason prevail and the ` yes ' campaign wins by a landslide !, 
  calling for the murder of countless people on the grounds of their skin colour ? 
  yeah , i would say she should probably be fired . .  she defended her position on camera , telling students ethnic minority women could not be racist as they do not stand to benefit from inequality . 
  it 's a little disconcerting when a `` welfare and diversity officer '' says something * that * misguided about racism . 
  she should probably be replaced by someone more well balanced , and less racist . 
  jesus , that is horrendous . 
  these are exactly the sort of people who should never be allowed to be police officers . 
  as far as i 'm aware he does n't think any differently of them than he does any other turk , or anyone else really . 
  i 've never really asked him about it , and he 's never mentioned anything like that . 
  i 'm guessing that just means `` it has to be done by a police investigation , not a parliamentary one '' ? 
  as gudkov himself said : `` translated into russian , this means : ` you will only know that truth that we will allow to be told to you , ' '' the police are a lot easier to buy , not as much risk involved for the kremlin . . , 
  one of my best friends was born and raised in turkey , to turkish parents . 
  dude 's as white as you can get . 
  it 's not your fault that the guy was a colossal piece of shit . 
  i 'm not sure i 'd heard it before ( i must have , at some point ) , but it 's quite beautiful . 
  congratulations , by the way !, 
  i had n't seen that one before . 
  it 's lovely . 
  i do n't really think about it , to be honest . 
  it 's fine by me . 
  i read about that jonathan jacob story . 
  it 's absolutely horrendous . 
  can we please refrain from linking to vdare ? 
  it 's an awful website in absolutely every way . . 
  every day is a happy europe day , simple . 
  it would appear that the conservative and unionist party victory is n't really helping to conserve the union . . 
  the university of groningen definitely has an excellent reputation in the netherlands . 
  i 'd look at / r/thenetherlands for more detailed responses , plenty of university of groningen students and people from the area there . 
  that is just beautiful . 
  never change , belgium . 
  for the record , in the second picture the man is saying : `` this arrow points that way , but it 's been taped off with tape in almost the same colour . '', 
  ( meaning , they could n't find a sign with the dutch `` wegomlegging '' on it that pointed in the right direction , so they got some tape in a colour that was as close to the colour of the sign as they could find and taped over the actual tip of the arrow , and used black tape on the other end to create an arrow tip that points in the direction they need it to point ), 
  well , clearly boris did n't get the memo , `` there were never any russian soldiers in ukraine '' , not in crimea , not in the donbass , no sir , none at all . . 
  i do n't imagine they 're all that happy about it . 
  i still ca n't even pronounce `` sl\u00e1inte '' properly . 
  dutch , english , german , mediocre french , bit of spanish , bit of russian , bit of italian . 
  learned mostly in school except english , which i learned mostly from watching television and playing video games , and dutch which i was raised with ( of course i was also taught both those languages in greater detail in school afterwards ) . 
  brb , gon na bbq some shashliks . 
  vaccination is n't mandatory in my country , yet ** 96 % ** of the people * choose * to get common vaccines voluntarily . 
  if it were n't for the super-religious communities refusing to get the vaccines because science = the devil , the rate would be closer to 99 % . 
  the anti-vaxxer idiots are the problem , not the lack of being forced to do something by your government . 
  however , as / u/nikopol _ sk pointed out , it * is * mandatory in slovakia , and that does n't seem to have prevented this even a little bit . . 
  tragic that a family dispute ends like this . 
  should n't happen . 
  come on balkans , let 's not do this again . 
  you 're such a beautiful part of the world , do n't go back to turmoil . 
  also , fuck the nla with a rusty fork . 
  that 's how the fptp system works . 
  the lib dems tried to have it changed a while back iirc , but the british would n't have it . 
   as europe killed more than 40,000 people accused of sorcery in the 17th and 18th centuries , stupidity kills . 
  he 's a brave warrior fighting the oppressors . 
  or so he repeats to himself over and over in front of the bathroom mirror , anyway . 
  yeah , you have to be careful with those buk missiles . . 
  you guys got along swimmingly with the persian empire back in the day , 
  that girl and i have very different views of what constitutes a bad person . 
  http://i.imgur.com/qphdj0q.gif just in case that was n't just a word joke : they 're responsible for aiding the pm in making public policy , and for informing the public about said policy . 
  within the mga there is also a specific scientific council that advises the pm on any policy involving scientific matters , as well as a small group of people responsible for facilitating any and all communications between the cabinet and the royal house . 
  basically the same story : 's - hertogenbosch = des hertogen bosch = the [ duke 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_i,_duke_of_brabant ) forest , to put it briefly ( brabant was a dukedom rather than a county , so they had a duke rather than a count ) . 
  and just like with the hague , while the official name 's - hertogenbosch is correct , the shortened `` den bosch '' ( which coincidentally also means `` the forest '' ) is much more commonly used . 
  [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/nl-%27s-gravenhage.ogg ) is how the gentleman from wiki pronounces it , in a sort of general accent-less dutch . 
  a local with a particularly noticeable the hague accent would put a slightly different spin on it , but this is the general pronunciation . 
   however , in the original `` des graven hage '' , it had a grammatical function ; `` des '' is an old article that would indicate possession , so `` of the '' or `` belonging to '' , i 'm aware of that , i was just referring to the name `` den haag '' , as meaning `` the forest '' . 
  as i mentioning in my previous comment , just calling it `` haag '' would be rather strange because it would just mean `` forest '' . 
  with the name `` den haag '' , everyone back then was aware it was in reference to the count 's forest . 
  's gravenhage is actually still an accepted , official name of the city , but the simpler `` den haag '' is much more common in usage , for obvious reasons . 
  there is n't really a grammatical reason behind it , it 's more for convenience . 
  `` the hague '' just means `` the forest '' , basically .
