  the city was named as `` the count 's forest '' , but we 've taken out the `` count 's '' part because there is no longer a count of holland , as holland is no longer an independent county , so it 's now just `` the forest '' or to put that in the less modern dutch : `` den haag '' . 
  the name `` the hague '' is just an anglicisation of the dutch name `` den haag '' , which just means `` the forest '' . 
  i think people , way back when , thought just calling it `` haag '' , or `` forest '' , would be a bit odd so they called it `` the forest '' in dutch ( den haag ) , and because the name den haag is difficult to pronounce for english speakers they anglicised it into `` the hague '' . 
  in the same way that el ciudad de los angeles ( the city of the angels ) , became just `` los angeles '' or `` the angels '' , so too did the city of the count 's forest became just `` the forest '' . 
  ironically , that is more or less what it means , yes . 
  what i will do is try to give a brief explanation as to why my city , the hague , is called the hague ; this is a question i 'm frequently asked by people from other countries when they find out where i 'm from . 
  the name `` the hague '' is an anglicisation of the dutch name `` den haag '' . 
  the official dutch name for the city in full is still '' 's - gravenhage '' , which is a shortened , phonetically written version of the name `` des graven hage '' , which is kind of old dutch for `` the count 's forest '' or `` the count 's hedge '' ( `` haag '' or `` hage '' can be used to mean either an actual forest or just a narrow rim of trees/plants , like a hedge , and nobody is 100 % sure if the name refers to the forest itself , or the forest rim , or `` hedge '' , that encloses the forest as the private hunting ground of the count ) . 
  before it was the city that it is now , the area that is now the hague was mostly forest area ( a part of which still exists in the form of het haagse bos ) , but it was n't public land . 
  the land was bought somewhere around the year 1230 by count floris iv of holland ( holland as a county was at that point a state of the holy roman empire ) , who wanted to build a residence for himself by a pond , now called [ the hofvijver ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hofvijver ) , near a good hunting area ( the forest ) . 
  the palace that was built is now known as [ the binnenhof ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/binnenhof ) and is now our houses of parliament as well as being home to the ministry of general affairs . 
  the village that originated around the binnenhof was first mentioned as `` haga '' in a charter from 1242 . 
  in the 15th century `` des graven hage '' came into use , literally `` the count 's wood '' or `` the count 's hedge '' . 
  i 'm mostly surprised that bernie has been on reddit for 2 years now . 
  a lot of politicians join reddit when they announce a new campaign , so they can use reddit as another platform , but bernie seems to be in it for the actual redditting ( not that he does n't take the opportunity to promote himself , of course ) . 
  but to answer your question : no , i do n't . 
  if anything , regional cultures have found stronger support as a result of the `` unification '' of europe . 
  when people feel like their cultural identity will be absorbed into a larger one , they get even more fervent and proud about their cultural identity to make sure it does n't become forgotten . 
  case in point : i went to america , could n't find a single american ; every local proudly proclaimed themselves to be irish , or italian , or polish , etc. 
  you read the comments under a yt video ? 
  rookie mistake , man . 
   islam is a whole way of life . 
  it 's not like other faiths . 
  it is , in principle a religion plus a system of government and law . 
  i 've seen/heard people try to make this argument a number of times , and it never holds up to scrutiny . 
  it 's is a typical talking point of those who try to demonize muslims by imprinting in people 's mind the laughable notion that muslims are somehow `` different '' from other people ( in much the same way that sennels does in the article ) . 
  the fact that there are countries where the government and law are based on koranic teachings does n't make islam any different as a religion than any of the others , no matter how hard you try to imply that it does . 
  before the enlightenment there were plenty of countries in europe where christianity was interpreted in the exact same way , with it being a religion plus a system of government and law ; in fact , there are political parties in my country who want to return to that way of life , where christianity is the law and the government as well as being a religion . 
  every one of the 3 abrahamic faiths has a holy scripture that includes sets of laws for living , we are lucky enough to live in a part of the world where the enlightenment has lead us to secularism , so the laws and ways of governing people as described by the holy books that are popular here are ignored , and we do n't have theocracies like you see in the middle east , for example . 
  here in the netherlands there is a political party called the sgp who includes in its aims `` to establish a government entirely based on the bible '' ( i.e. 
  a theocracy proposed by religious fundamentalists ) , and `` make fighting against anti-christian groups and organisations one of the main tasks of government '' . 
  we 're lucky to be a largely secular society so these people do n't get any power like they do in other , less secular parts of the world , like we see in the middle east and africa for example . 
  your listing of various facts about the way religion is practiced in far away , unenlightened non-secular societies have no bearing on our society . 
   so when people are practicing islam in the netherlands , what they are practicing is a different country than the netherlands . 
  i live in an apartment building that is , by my personal estimation , inhabited for at least 90 % by muslims , in a particularly muslim-dominated part of the hague . 
  i get along great with 99 % of my neighbours , they are wonderful people and the notion that they are `` practicing a different country '' here is * ridiculously * incorrect . 
  it 's clear that you are trying to present muslims as this `` other '' among us , but what you come up against is reality . 
  you 're trying to use the realities of life in backwards , 3rd-world places to shape our view of muslims in our own societies , but in stead the reality * here * is what shapes our view of muslims in our own society , so we look at articles like these and just laugh at them . 
  the whole thing smacks of yet another writer trying to profit from the growing anti-muslim sentiment by contributing to it . 
  it 's painfully obvious the man 's methods were far from scientific and/or designed to achieve the result he wanted them to achieve , and he is as biased as it gets . 
  so many of his assertions were just plain ludicrous . 
  you `` did n't register any major differences between the mentalities '' of muslims from bosnia , muslims from pakistan , and muslims from africa ? 
  really ? 
  because i know some muslims from bosnia , and quite a few from africa , and they have * nothing * in common other than their religious traditions and their humanity , so it would seem you 've either found no major differences between the mentalities of * criminals * from these countries and chose to assign it to the religion they have in common rather than the criminality they have in common ( either in an attempt to espouse a link between the two , or just in an attempt to misrepresent the reality in general ) , or you just started from the position that they 're `` all the same '' and made the data fit the conclusion rather than the other way around . 
  seeing as every few days another one of their members outs himself as a massive bigot , shortly followed by farage declaring every single one of them to be nothing more than `` a bad apple '' again and again and again , i 'd be quite worried as to who will follow him as ukip leader . . farage is one of the few vaguely presentable people in the party . 
  have n't we all been complaining for years that the us should get its troops out of our countries ? 
   regional deputy governor ruslan smolensky denounced the banner as the result of excessive zeal by a young designer and a departure from russia 's traditional `` values , '' the report said . 
   `` if we are to speak about our western allies , we are now observing a total devaluation of human values that has taken place there , '' smolensky was quoted as saying . 
  `` this devaluation is taking place here as well . '' i suppose it 's good that the local government denounced it , although a bit of a shame that they felt the need to bash the west for `` having no values '' \u00e0 propos of nothing . 
  thank god they were caught before they could actually carry anything out . 
  it 's the first i 've heard of this `` old schools society '' , does anybody know anything about them ? 
  congratulations to the people of latvia !, 
  you can actually still watch shakespeare plays performed in the original pronunciation at shakespeare 's globe . 
  it 's [ quite interesting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gplppht7n9s ) . 
  these are the same cunts who ride around with flags with stalin 's face on them and who proposed setting up an anti-maidan movement with the slogan `` death to faggots '' , right ? 
  fuck these people . 
  jesus christ , that is horrendous . 
  i hope these people never get to taste freedom again . 
  if you 're asking `` could a major european city ever see a massive riot '' , then yes , that has happened before and could happen again . 
  we do n't tend to have anywhere near as many police killings though , so a riot breaking out for the same reasons is far less likely , but could definitely still happen . 
  it seems there 's good living to be had in svalbard . 
   rather than treating us to another one of your drug fueled red diatribes : aww , that is adorable . 
  i did ask you quite politely before , but it seems you did n't read it so i 'll ask it again : please do n't reply to me again . 
  have a nice day bravely fighting the war against the people in your head who are denying all sorts of things , but stop trying to project it onto me when i 'm just asking you to stop spamming the sub . 
  bye bye now . 
  go to norway and sweden to get educated , then on to finland to get drunk !, 
   lead by a coalition of liberals ( vvd ) the vvd , [ liberals ] ( http://cdn.meme.am/images/8570175.jpg ) . 
  i was just joking , really . 
  vyvian approves . 
  a lot of people do n't understand the difference , including reporters . 
  he 's a crafty bastard that boris . 
  winning over every voter with ears in one fell swoop . 
  i imagine / r/yurop will be all over this . 
   it 's quite obvious you were trying to dissuade a discussion about this topic . 
  it 's quite obvious i was annoyed with you creating multiple threads to address your little fight with some user in r/melbourne , because it is spamming the sub . 
  it is quite obvious to everyone , hence the fact that the call for you to just give it a rest got upvoted , while your post got downvoted to pieces for being a shitpost . 
   you 've continued this by attempting to characterize it as a feud . 
  it 's not . 
  is that why you created a separate account just for this 2 days ago ? 
   goodbye , and please do n't respond to me again . 
  good luck and have a nice day . 
  / r/europe is not a place for repeatedly trying to drag users into your own feud with users from another sub . 
  nobody is trying to silence you , nobody is denying anything , the people of / r/europe are downvoting your attempts to drag us into your personal feud with a user from / r/melbourne , that is all . 
  feel free to keep pretending that i denied stuff despite the fact that everyone here can see that i never denied anything , feel free to keep pretending that i 'm somehow trying to silence you despite the fact that everyone here knows i could n't do that even if i wanted to , but stop bothering me and the other users here at / r/europe with it . 
  edited to add :  you are a self confessed dope smoker and red who thinks that red terror regimes are cool , we get it . 
  go and play in traffic , you fucking reprobate . 
  i am neither of those things , * again * you are making stuff up to make it seem like i am some sort of communist and this is about the soviet-supporters vs the soviet-opponents when it is in fact not , i am merely an / r/europe regular asking you to stop spamming the sub with your newly created alt account . 
  sounds like a nice , rational man . . / s, 
  you keep going on about communism , even though it has nothing to do with the discussion between myself and op . 
  i have n't said anything about communism , because it is n't relevant to what i 'm talking about to op , namely the fact that op has chosen to use this subreddit for a purpose it is not intended for : his personal vendetta against another redditor . 
  i 'm simply telling op to stop doing this , as it is not what the sub is for , and is annoying to the community here ( which is displayed by the fact that he got nothing but downvotes for his attempt to vote-brigade another sub ) . 
  * sigh *  as someone who lived under communism and lives still in a post communist country , please understand it is incredibly hurtful and disrespectful to us to be told , arrogantly i might add , that the horrors we had to endure are nothing other than being `` butthurt '' . 
  i never said anything like that , i said that mrstalinthankyou , the op , is butthurt about an exchange he had with another redditor , and is now creating thread after thread to try to get other people involved in his feud with the other redditor , because he is butthurt about the exchange he had with the redditor . 
  at no point did i say anything about communism or anything like it , i was merely telling op to stop whining about an exchange he had with a random stranger 2 days ago and move on . 
   so , go fuck yourself you entitled piece of shit . 
  do n't tell people they are buthurt just because you had the privilege of growing up in a normal country . 
  again , i did not tell anyone that , you are misunderstanding the conversation , so i will not go and fuck myself , thank you . 
  you are mistaken , at no point was i talking about communism or denying or dismissing anything , i am simply telling op to stop bothering the community here at r/europe with his personal feud against some dude from r/melbourne , because we do n't like it ( hence all the threads he creates getting downvoted into oblivion ) . 
  every time someone disagrees with you , or even just tells you to give it a rest , you go into this `` oh , you 're a denier ! '', 
  and `` oh , you 're trying to silence me , are n't you !,
