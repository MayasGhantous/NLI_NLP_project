  the israeli-bots and kremlin-bots are one of my favourite parts of reddit . 
  not that far from how we stereotype each other ourselves , actually . 
  `` ivan the oppressed by western gay atheist fascists '' just has a better ring to it . 
  judging from the article it sounds like the guy lived like a bit of a rockstar . 
  and he did n't even have to go all the way to argentina . 
  people are very triggerhappy with the terrorism accusations these days . 
  just about everyone who does something awful is called a terrorist by default . 
  no , no , no . 
  humanitarian convoys !, 
  the argument is that wealthy , heterosexual white males are superior than every other type of human , and therefore should be the only ones deciding on political and social matters . 
  ironically , the ancient athenians were not averse to a bit of inter-male butt-fucking , and considered homosexual love to be the ultimate , purest form of love ( as an extension of their `` men are way better than women '' mentality ; the ancient greeks worshiped the male body in every sense of the word , these are after all the same people who came up with the naked olympics ) , but he had conveniently left that bit out of his analogy . 
  edit : not too sure about the downvotes . . you understand that this is n't * my * argument , right ? 
  i 'm explaining the argument employed by the idiot over in r/european . . 
  that 's r/europeans , it 's very different to r/european , despite having a confusingly similar name . 
  russian dashcam-footage videos will be taken to the next level . 
  the last time i checked in at r/european , the top comment under the top post on the frontpage was a guy saying `` the ancient athenians had it right : never let women or non-natives vote '' , with a ton of upvotes . 
  it 's probably still on there . 
  it 's a personal favourite , loosely based on one of my favourite books : * do androids dream of electric sheep ? 
  * by philip k. dick . 
  more recently hauer had a small part in * sin city * , and starred in the controversial * hobo with a shotgun * a few years ago . 
  maybe i 'm just an incredibly old man , but ... you do n't know who rutger hauer is ??? 
  he was pretty much the most famous living dutch person in the world for decades . 
  he was in * bladerunner * !, 
  one of the best movies ever made !, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhbewigkrvk ) is him on letterman , and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noazpa1x7ju ) is his famously ( partially ) improvised speech from bladerunner , with the surrounding scene . 
  obviously we had loads of famous painters and explorers , but i thought op was looking more for currently alive people , and people of whom it might not be common knowledge that they are born in the netherlands . 
  rutger hauer , a bunch of djs , carice van houten . 
  vile and disgusting . 
  speaking as a journalist who * used to * enjoy visiting turkey , erdogan 's government is an affront to press-freedom , freedom in general , and is making one giant step in the wrong direction for turkey after the other . 
  a real shame . 
  `` why ca n't everyone just cater to our intolerance ?! '', 
  guess what , if we 're going to be handing out benefits to people just for being married , we 're going to be handing those out to * all * married people . 
  how about english as a lingua franca ? 
  it 's already the closest thing to a united lingua franca anyway , and the majority of eu citizens would n't have to learn a new language . . 
  my money 's on the culprits . 
  the question was ` who ' , not ` what ' . 
  people treating their political opponents ( and his wife and children ) with abuse and violence rather than discourse and debate is ` nice ' ? 
  israel has a tendency to put heavy pressure on anyone who points out the way they behave themselves out there , and is capable of doing so thanks to the usa immediately catering to their every whim , and , as you pointed out , eurovision is n't interested in taking a stand of any kind . 
  `` zondag met lubach '' is very good , it 's one of the few comedy shows on dutch television i actually enjoy . 
  i find the humour a little lacking at times , but they always make some good points . 
  they 're quite good at pointing out some of the more ridiculous parts of our country/society ( such as , in this case , the monarchy and the ridiculously dated laws and principles behind them ) , as well as the glaring shortcomings of our media in general . 
  i make it no secret that i 'm not a fan of russia 's government , but that does n't mean we have anything against the russian people . 
  i 've been to russia a few times , and while its government was never too friendly to me , me being a western journalist and all , i 've always found its people to be wonderful . 
  there was a great bit in the `` bullshit ! '', 
  episode about the vatican , where they talk about the power the vatican has over italian politics . 
  it 's really quite fucked up . 
  i imagine that will be srd 's new favourite sub . 
  supporting the existence of a nation \u2260 nationalism, 
  hitler-salutes and white power flags are a natural reaction to the failures of authorities across the nation ? 
  `` nationalism is an infantile disease , it is the measles of mankind '' - albert einstein, 
  the far-right are getting more and more insane throughout europe . 
  with my basic knowledge of russian i can tell you the title says `` boris nemtsov something something putin something something '' . 
  that 's about as far as i get , though . 
  more of a rugby man myself , but our nation 's football team generally does quite well i believe . 
  i do think we hold the record for most wc finals played without ever winning one , though . 
  always the bridesmaid , never the bride . 
  it should be noted that andr\u00e9 van schie is a moron , and that the vvd ( despite the fact that they constantly say they are ) are not a liberal party . 
  moreover , the governing parties seem to be splintering up a bit as well . 
  i was about to write `` what is this , the news from last year ? '', 
  but then i realized how good it feels to finally have solid evidence . 
  and then i remembered that the kremlin will just spin it into something about fascists and gays , and got depressed again . 
  no better way to start the day than commie flakes , i always say . 
  when you think about it , if i were to ask my religious friends why they are religious , or why they belong to the religion they belong to , the vast majority of them will reply : `` because when i was little , my parents told me that that 's the religion i belong to , and that those are our beliefs . '', 
  most religious parents will try to make sure their child will grow up to be a member of the same religion they are a member of , and to what intensity they 'll do this depends on how determined they are to make sure of it . 
  obviously these parents are opting for the drill-instructor approach , like those jesus camp people who force their children to chant `` praise jesus '' for ages every day . 
  i feel like if you have to shout that `` god is great '' that much , you 're probably overcompensating for a lack of actual greatness . 
  like dudes who constantly talk about how big their dick is . 
  there 's all sorts of wild speculation about what 's going on with putin at the moment , and some journalist claims a kremlin insider told him there was to be a giant announcement today or tomorrow . 
  it 's likely to turn out to be nothing , but it might be something . 
  we have some great food . 
  we stole it from the indonesians , but we have it nonetheless . 
  speaking as a journalist , i can tell you it 's astonishing how lazy a lot of journalism is nowadays , to the point where even things like spell-checking are considered too much effort . 
  just last week [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vlhbg7h.jpg ) was published , which means it went across at * least * 3 different people 's desks unnoticed . 
  you would n't believe how common that is these days . 
  god it was a good day yesterday . 
  not just opstelten , but teeven as well !, 
  the two most out-of-touch , reactionary assholes in the cabinet , gone just like that . 
  the two biggest threats to everything that makes our country great , who have collectively exerted their best efforts to turn our fine country into a privacy-free , authoritarian police-state , and fill their own pockets as much as possible in the process , are out of power . 
  god it was a good day yesterday . 
  you may say that as a joke , but i live in the hague , and there actually are a number of last-minute streetparties being set up and carried out as we speak . 
  another beautiful example . 
  there are a lot of castles in the netherlands .

  i feel for our friends in turkey . 
  the current government seems to be fervently devoted to taking the country as far into the wrong direction as it can . 
  just look at all those ethnic russians being brutally oppressed by the fascists . 
  ireland will win the 6n in a few weeks and it will have been mostly because of joe schmidt . 
  [ oh yeah . . ] ( http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/30400000/i-can-t-help-it-but-love-you-it-s-getting-better-all-the-time-michael-jackson-30449538-450-247.gif ), 
  pokerface putin strikes again . 
  well , there was an article from ukraine today posted here yesterday that quoted ukrainian intelligence , and when the term `` propaganda '' is defined as `` anything that makes russia look bad '' , as it is by some people on reddit , then that would be called a propaganda piece . 
  you 're not wrong about the fact that this was already posted yesterday , though . 
  the hague performs all the tasks that are typically performed by a nation 's capital city : seat of government , seat of parliament , seat of the supreme court , seat of the council of state . 
  that 's why there is confusion sometimes . 
  `` why is slovenia a good example of a nation state ? '', 
  why is that a question they would ask ? 
  what 's the story there ? 
  yeah , i do n't blame you . 
  he 's that rare combination of self-worshiping clown * and * manipulative psycho . 
  no good can come of it . 
  he once said , when asked why he constantly records his own voice wherever he goes , `` would n't it be amazing if you could hear socrates having a conversation with his barber ? '' .
