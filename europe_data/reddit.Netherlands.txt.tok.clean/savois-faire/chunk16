  everybody is not ok with that , and that is not how precedent works . 
  you clearly have no idea what you 're talking about , and are just trying to make excuses for this vile thing the russian government has done . 
  just acknowledge it 's wrong , we all acknowledge it 's wrong when other governments do it , you should be able to acknowledge it 's wrong when your own government does it too . 
  saying `` another country 's government has done this awful thing , so our government should get to do it also ! '', 
  is not how precedent works . 
  nice try , amsterdam . 
  you wanted to be the capital , you get to live with the swarms of tourists . 
  yours truly , the hague . 
  your `` solid precedent '' does nothing to justify this disgusting and frankly pathetic course of action from the russian government . 
   and trump can not be facist because facists were socialists and his ideas are not social . 
  lol, 
  [ thanks , mr. cameron ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-government-urged-to-reveal-its-role-in-getting-saudi-arabia-a-key-un-human-rights-role-a6794801.html ), 
  it 's really sad , but i would n't be at all surprised . 
  he has already told the constitutional court ( the highest court in the country ) , after it ruled that he could n't just hold journalists he did n't like in prison , that if they do n't fall in line they might cease to exist . 
   here are some things that russian authorities have labeled gay propaganda : holding signs that say `` gay is ok '' ; rainbow balloons ; a friendship between a captive goat and tiger ; and reporting on gay rights . 
  now , a calvin klein ad is being investigated as a potential offender jesus christ , russia . 
  grow up already . 
  in any thread about migrants , / r/europe and / r/european are indistinguishable . 
  the only difference is that / r/european has no threads that are * not * about migrants ( well , except for the ones about how jews are evil and all that ) . 
  `` their shitty behaviour justifies our shitty behaviour ! '', 
  - people on both sides missing the point, 
  as a journalist , this stuff makes my blood boil . 
  between what 's happening in turkey and the direction the uk 's government is heading in , things are quickly going from bad to worse . 
  the snooper 's charter is a disgustingly awful piece of legislation . 
  that damned junta !, 
   turkey 's president tayyip erdogan said on friday a constitutional court ruling that led to the release of two detained newspaper editors was a step against the country and warned the court that repeating such actions could bring its very existence into question . 
   the constitutional court ruled last month that the detention of can dundar and erdem gul , editor-in-chief and ankara bureau chief of the opposition cumhuriyet newspaper , was `` unlawful '' and had violated their individual freedom and safety . 
  poor erdogan , all he wants to do is shut down opposition media , eradicate the freedom of the press , and lock up any and all journalists who speak negatively about him , and that damned , pesky constitution has to go and get in his way . 
  unbelievable . 
  speaking as someone from the randstad , that is not the randstad . 
  speaking as a journalist , [ this one ] ( http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/82ffc361-238e-46c9-b9e7-269c1be9e14b-714x519.jpg ) is depressingly good . 
  i certainly do n't support it , as i despise nationalism , but i think it 's pretty obvious why it 's on the rise . 
  the eu 's approach to the refugee crisis has been nothing short of disastrous . 
  edit : missing words, 
  right , you got me . 
  / s keep acting like a 12 year old if you like , just go bother someone else with it please . 
  just your basic qwerty . 
  right , except it was very obviously a joke . 
  it was n't exactly a difficult one to spot , nobody else is struggling with it ... 
   if only that were true . 
  it very obviously is n't , that was sort of the point ... it 's a joke , not a serious comment , and everyone but you realises that . 
   nope , you suffer from a superiority complex . 
  you 'd notice if you knew what self-reflection was . 
  lol , the arrogance of accusing someone else of having a superiority complex and not knowing what self-reflection is , all because of your inability to recognise a joke for what it is , is a thing of beauty . 
  relax , dude , you do n't need to take everything so seriously . 
  edit : spelling words is difficult, 
  [ we 've been doing some preparations already ] ( http://www.murdoconline.net/2008/orange_tank.jpg ), 
  there 's that flemish insecurity . 
  just because we like the danes and the germans more does n't mean we do n't like you as well . 
  as is bosnia , then . 
  exactly , this whole discussion is moronic . 
  there are things europe does better , there are things america does better . 
  if there is a particular thing you care very greatly about , you 'll probably want to live in the place that does that thing better . 
  cheese . 
  well , holland is a region within the netherlands , so sometimes dutch people will get annoyed if you refer to the country as `` holland '' rather than `` the netherlands '' . 
  personally i think it 's a bit silly , but some people get really pissed off about it . 
  it might be because i am from the part of the netherlands that is holland , so i am actually from holland as well as being from the netherlands , but there are a lot of people who are from the netherlands but not from holland and some of them really hate it when people confuse the two . 
  i think it 's a lot of fuss over nothing , personally . 
   i agree , the dutch navy sounds better . 
  it 's a kind of linguistic disconnect ( for lack of a better term , although there may be one i 'm unaware of ) . 
  the dutch word for `` dutch '' as in `` he is dutch '' , is `` nederlands '' as in `` hij is nederlands '' . 
  the dutch word for `` dutchman '' as in `` he is a dutchman '' , is `` nederlander '' as in `` hij is een nederlander '' . 
  we do n't really have a word that corresponds to `` dutch '' ( although it 's believed to come from `` diets '' , which is an old word that referred to a collection of [ old dutch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_dutch ) languages that were spoken ages ago in a region that is now the netherlands and belgium ) . 
  in dutch it 's called `` de koninklijke marine '' , which just means `` the royal navy '' . 
  if we were to give it a national adjective , it would be `` de koninklijke nederlandse marine '' . 
  they do , but not when they have to go to a train station . 
  half the bicycles you see in those pictures are either stolen from somewhere else by the people who parked them there , or will get stolen from there by someone else . 
  in the cities , you do n't leave nice bikes standing around , especially not in a central location like a train station , because they 'll just get stolen . 
  most dutch people will also have a good bike , which is the one they 'll use for their daily trips to the supermarket etc. , or on cycling trips ) , and these will come with solid , expensive chain locks to keep them from getting stolen . 
  but if you know you 're going to be leaving your bike at a train station , especially for a whole day or multiple days while you 're away somewhere , you know you have two choices : take a piece of shit bike that you have for use in the city because it is n't likely to get stolen because it is n't worth anything , or take your nice bike and get bummed out when you come back to find it has been stolen . 
  in general traffic you 'll see plenty of very nice bikes . 
  at train stations , which are sometimes almost like open markets for bicycles , you 'll find only crappy bikes ( homeless people will often find a spot just outside of a station and sell bikes that they `` found '' , for people who came back from wherever they took the train to and find that their bike has been stolen or they ca n't find it , but who do n't want to risk stealing one for themselves to get home on ) . 
  you 'll also find some nice ones , but they 're never around for very long , either because their owners are smart enough to not leave them there for long , or because their owners are not smart enough to do that and the bikes get stolen . 
  if you look at footage of people in a dutch city just riding around , you 'll see plenty of [ decent bikes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-abpav5e5m ) mixed in with the crappy ones , but train stations are havens of thieves and opportunistic homeless people . 
  in towns and villages you 'll find a lot more nice bikes , whereas in the cities you 'll find more piece of shit bikes , because stealing is more common there . 
   if someone were to start one of these japanese bike garages here , the place would be empty , but the street in front of it would be covered in bikes . 
  this is exactly what i was thinking . 
  i 'm not putting my bike , my most important possession , into some machine that stuffs it into the ground . 
  i 'd park it so that it leans against the machine if my kickstand were broken , though . 
  not amateurs , my friend , artists . 
  the japanese system looks like a nightmare to me , the way the dutch use their bikes , and the rate at which they use them , it would never work . 
  i wonder how well they 'd cope here , given the numbers . 
  japan has 72 million bikes for 127 million people . 
  not too bad . 
  finland has 3 million bikes for 5 million people . 
  sweden has 6 million bikes for 9 million people . 
  the netherlands ? 
  17 million people , 17 million bikes . 
  53 % of the japanese population consists of cyclists . 
  finland has 60 % , sweden just over 60 . 
  denmark is way ahead with 78 % . 
  but head and shoulders above the rest are the dutch , with over 99 % . 
  the average distance cycled per person per day is 2.5 kilometers . 
  when you have * that * many bikes being used * that * regularly by * that * many people , this happens : https://idonotdespair.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/sea-of-bikes-utrecht.jpg http://media4.trover.com/t/557008d08e7cb274bf000bcb/fixedw_large_4x.jpg http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_e-gmv1jfkte/tozvra_9owi/aaaaaaaahvw/6zocln4orci/s1600/100_5247.jpg, 
  as a dutchman , i find it has [ a certain beauty ] ( http://dandyhorsemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/adam-bike-parking-probs-photo-by-alex-rk-flickr.jpg ) . 
  such things would take up valuable room we need to [ store our bikes ] ( http://www.citi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/483-3.jpg ) . 
  you 're going to have to find a way to accept it , bernie . 
  as a player , i 'm not sure . 
  i get what they 're going for , and i do n't think tackling should be an aspect of the game for the real young ones , but the later you start teaching players how to tackle and make them comfortable playing the game with tackling , the more improper tackling ( which is usually dangerous tackling ) you 'll find in the game when they 're older . 
  part of me wants to say `` just make them play touch until they 're fully developed '' , on the other hand i ca n't help but wonder what that would do the game as a whole .
