  i know literally nothing about you , how could i have an opinion of you ? 
  why is belgium 's crime index so much higher than ours ? 
  i 'm surprised luxembourg is higher than us , too . 
  that 's a pretty major cut-off from belgium to the netherlands . 
  i 'm talking about shows aimed at very young children , like peppa pig and dora the explorer . 
  other than that we do n't do dubbing , that 's why i corrected the user saying how `` the dutch dub everything !, 
  '' , which is just nonsense . 
  i 'm assuming it 's `` other than the ones i learned in school '' . 
  they only dub children 's television , because young children find it hard to follow along with subtitles . 
  they 're not the best readers . 
  other than that , nothing is dubbed here . 
  so opposition to homosexuality is at its strongest in palestine , egypt , jordan , tunisia , indonesia , kenya , uganda , ghana , senegal , and nigeria . 
  those are all the countries that are listed as above 90 percent being against it . 
  of those 10 countries , 6 are countries where the vast majority of the population is muslim ( egypt , palestine , indonesia , senegal , jordan , and tunisia ) , and 4 are countries where the vast majority of the population is christian ( uganda , kenya , ghana , and nigeria ) . 
  it seems that the old equation `` underdeveloped part of the world + religion = bigotry '' still holds up . 
  presumably this is a parody of that skinner & baddiel song from the world cup ? 
  some photgraphs from the scene : http://imgur.com/a/ivbm0 ( credit to / u/booze-d ) the guy driving the train was the only casualty . 
  yeah , because the ypg are the problem in syria . 
   nothing ` slanted ' about that . 
  well , leaving aside that it is the actual definition of slanted , sure . 
  referring to asylum seekers as `` losers who fucked up their life and their chances '' is * entirely * slanted language and betrays a subjective stance rather than an objective measure , which is something one avoids in academic studies , which is why it was n't there . 
  this is something you want to avoid , that 's why the reasons given * do * include objective statements , but do * not * include things like `` they 're all just a bunch of losers and criminals ! '' . 
  to include that would make it impossible for your study/paper/essay / article/whatever to be taken seriously by anyone other than those who just want to be told what they want to hear . 
  which is what i already explained to you , two comments ago . 
   and you just confirmed , there 's nothing academic about those studies , aka they are pretty much worthless to determine real factors at play . 
  they 're 100 % dependent on the subject to get information about said subject . 
  lol . 
  have i now ? 
  you clearly know your stuff . 
  referring to people as `` losers '' is slanted by * any * definition of the word , sorry to have to break it to you . 
  and yes , those were found to be the main reasons by various studies , by organisations like the refugee council . 
  again , you do n't have to like it , but downvoting it only makes you guys look pathetic and insecure . 
  i have n't argued either side of that choice , i 've merely laid out the main reasons why people move to another country to seek asylum , as found by studies into asylum seeking and the motivations that drive it . 
  i did n't say ` someone seeking more money can be defined as an asylum seeker ' , i listed , as one of the main reasons people go to another country to seek asylum ( according to various studies , although that did n't prevent me from being the one who had to bear the sea of downvotes because i dared to list merely objective statements regarding asylum seeking without including the only * opinion * / r/europe will allow on this subject : that they 're all evil parasites who need to be dumped in the middle of the ocean ) , the following :  economic reasons - trying to find work , escaping from poverty quite a lot of people seek asylum in countries with better economic circumstances than those present in their own countries , because those circumstances in their own country leave them unable to provide for themselves or their families , so they go to countries where there are more opportunities for employment and/or higher wages . 
  western european countries rank among the top of the list , in that regard . 
  agree or disagree with the practice , the fact remains that that happens a lot . 
   by your definition , could you deny that i am an asylum seeker , because my life in finland makes me depressed due to the darkness , and i have recourse for escape from it ? 
  i would say not , because by the definition i gave , depression is not a reason for seeking asylum . 
  you can get the aforementioned `` relief , aid , or escape '' from that particular condition within your own country . 
  if there 's no work for you to be found in your country and you need money to feed your children or pay for your wife 's medicine , and there is work for you to be found in another country , you may apply for asylum in that country . 
  if you apply for asylum in a country citing as the reason your depression , you 'll likely be told to go see a doctor or therapist in your home country . 
  edited to add : your link seems to agree with me . 
  it defines the difference between a refugee and an asylum seeker , it illustrates how an asylum seeker * can be * a refugee but does n't necessarily have to be , and it gives as a definition for asylum seekers `` a person who has left their country of origin and formally applied for asylum in another country '' , with which i will not disagree . 
  definitions : 1 . 
  ( especially formerly ) an institution for the maintenance and care of the mentally ill , orphans , or other persons requiring specialized assistance . 
  2 . an inviolable refuge , as formerly for criminals and debtors ; sanctuary : he sought asylum in the church . 
  3 . international law : ** a ) a refuge granted an alien by a sovereign state on its own territory . 
  ** b ) a temporary refuge granted political offenders , especially in a foreign embassy . 
  4 . any secure retreat . 
  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/asylum refuge , noun . 
  definitions : 1 . shelter or protection from danger , trouble , etc. 
  : * to take refuge from a storm * . 
  ** a place of shelter , protection , or safety . 
  ** anything to which one has recourse for aid , relief , or escape .

  i only listed the main reasons people go to other countries to seek asylum , as found by studies . 
  slanted , politically motivated statements tend not to make those lists . 
  by that logic there are no asylum seekers . 
  economic migrant ? 
  you 're not an asylum seeker , you 're seeking better economic circumstances . 
  refugee ? 
  you 're not seeking asylum , you 're seeking peace . 
  escaping political persecution ? 
  you 're not seeking asylum , you 're seeking refuge from persecution . 
  ` asylum seeker ' is an umbrella term we use to refer to all people who come to another country in the hopes of being allowed asylum there , for whatever reason . 
  it 's a practicality . 
  it 's one of the three main reasons people * seek * asylum , and i did not claim to do anything other than list the main reasons people seek asylum . 
  whether or not it 's a justified basis for being given asylum is another matter , and not for me to decide . 
  edit : grammar, 
  people seek asylum in other countries for all sorts of reasons . 
  the main reasons are : 1 . fleeing political or religious persecution , torture and repressive regimes 2 . economic reasons - trying to find work , escaping from poverty 3 . escaping from conflict and/or war edit : good to see / r/europe has not yet abandoned that golden combination of `` if we do n't like facts , we downvote them ! '', 
  and `` anything that talks about refugees or asylum seekers and does n't describe them all as vermin that needs to be exterminated must be downvoted ! '' . 
  this sub gets more pathetic by the day . 
  pile on your salty downvotes , sorry my listing did n't include any `` but of course the main reason is that they 're all scum , and they should all be rounded up and dumped in the ocean like the demonspawn they are !, 
  '' , i know how easily any reference to refugees or asylum seekers that does n't include the only allowed opinion triggers you delicate souls . 
  for a bunch of redditors united in opposition to leftists ' thought-policing , you sure are quick to downvote en masse anyone who shares even just a simple factual overview in regards to this particular subject , if it does n't include the only opinion you 'll allow another to have . 
  asylum seekers and refugees are not necessarily the same thing . 
  refugees often seek asylum , thus they are often asylum seekers , but not all asylum seekers are refugees . 
   many people believe that auschwitz was run by poles to kill jews i 've never met a single person who believes that , nor have i ever heard that before . 
   in reality it was run by nazis yes ... everyone knows that though ...  to kill poles well , a lot of poles , and also a lot of other people . 
   their religion was irrelevant that 's just not true . 
   at least for soccer in europe , where all supporters are openly affiliated with one or another political party . 
  i 'm not really a soccer fan , but i know a lot of people who are , and we are in europe . 
  none of the soccer supporters i know are affiliated with a political party , be it openly or otherwise . 
  they just want to watch their team . 
  keep your politics out of my sports . 
  as long as people obey the law , you * should * leave them alone . 
  a touch of moronic demagoguery is just what this debate needed !, 
  gorgeous . 
  it looks like a painting . 
  i wonder why we have so few when everyone around us has anywhere between 5 to 10 times as many . 
  this may be an older graph , but have n't they carried out a few bombings on the ypg as well ? 
  i had the same reaction . 
  i cross both the dutch-belgian border and the dutch-german border fairly regularly and i 've never encountered any border control . 
  looks fascinating , and neeson 's voice is a thing of beauty . 
  thanks for posting !, 
  it 's not the official one . 
  the one they used [ includes the coat of arms ] ( http://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server1300/f0564/products/201/images/1156/germany_2__63256.1415221816.1280.1280.png?c=2 ) , the actual german flag just looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/flag_of_germany.svg/1280px-flag_of_germany.svg.png ) . 
  it 's just a weird cocktail of different sports . 
  it looks like a combination of soccer , basketball , and rugby .
