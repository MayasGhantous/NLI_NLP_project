  those are incredibly well made , i have to say . 
  i particularly like the one with the clown ( not donald trump , the clown with the actual clown make-up ) . 
  good job . 
  i suspect he 's one of these `` criticise something the israeli government does ? 
  you hate jews ! '', 
  types . 
  that 's obviously only because we are not in the tournament . 
   let 's show the welsh how rugby should be played !!!, 
  as someone who has n't forgotten last year , all i can say is : have you figured out [ how to break the welsh defence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ruyy7hq5k ) yet ? 
  rugby fan and player here , will also be watching the rugby instead , but that does n't change the fact that people who play american football are tough as nails , and the simple fact is they need to wear that protective stuff because they take bigger hits . 
  in rugby you can get away with wearing just padding because we tackle in accordance with rules specifically designed to minimise the risk of injury to both the tackling player and the tackled player . 
  there is also talk of helmets being brought into the sport , to bring down the amount of concussions , which plague the sport . 
  edit : spelling, 
  munster 's arsehole . 
  they even have homeless people !, 
  nah , almere is just `` the place where people who want to live in amsterdam but ca n't afford to live in amsterdam live '' , it 's not particularly ugly . 
  did you see the video ? 
  they were white germans , not refugees . 
  swing and a miss . 
  i would raise you a little place called mastic beach , new york ; referred to by the locals as `` mistake beach '' , also known as `` new york 's white trash walhalla '' , it 's a lovely part of the world where you can buy a house for $ 300 .

  he sounds like a troll . 
  i 'm simply pointing out the inaccuracy of his statement . 
  he 's arguing that the raping of boys is a big issue in the middle east , but then the source he uses to back up his claim is about rape in a different place . 
  that 's just bad argumentation , and there 's nothing wrong with pointing it out . 
  and no , i 'm very familiar with this subreddit , so i do n't expect this , or anything , to get in the way of the `` every muslim is an evil peadophile who wants to kill you '' circlejerk . 
  nothing gets in the way of that around here . 
  well , you 're free to leave europe if you want to , as we all are . 
  that 's how it should be . 
  i may not be a big fan of president obama , or the guy that came before him , but i 've never hated americans . 
  i mean , i may dislike some individual americans , in the same way that there are some dutch people i dislike , but i have nothing against americans as a whole and i do n't think many europeans really do . 
  where are they ? 
  because i do n't see them ... 
   we all know the real reason why police actively prevented this from ever going public . 
  because they never go public with sex crimes involving a minor , regardless of who it is . 
  especially ones where the perpetrator is already caught . 
  your claim is about [ the middle east ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/middle_east ) , but your source is about afghanistan , a country in [ south asia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_asia ) . 
  edit : when facts interrupt the narrative , reach for that downvote button !, 
  the / r/europe way !, 
   do n't smell whataboutism everywhere . 
  i 'm not saying anything about whataboutism , that 's your nose smelling that ; i 'm saying let 's talk about the subject of the thread . 
  i 'm saying that in / r/europe we should be able to talk about things the russian government does without every time , without fail , the american government being brought up by someone as a counter point . 
  lukashenko has been president of belarus for 22 years . 
  * sigh * why is it that , even in a subreddit specifically about europe , you can not ever talk about something the russian government does without someone immediately going `` oh yeah ? 
  well what about america ??!! '' . 
  maybe we just want to talk about the subject of the thread , and not about america . 
  russian abuses against tatars ? 
  i would n't exactly say `` unprecedented '' ... 
  yeah , but nobody other than limburgers really considers limburg a part of the country , [ including the national railway service ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/archives/images/nlenlimb.jpg ) . 
  as r/europe 's official representative of the cheese capital of the world , i 'm afraid i have to inform you that curds are for turds . 
  absolutely wonderful and gorgeous country , some of the greatest people you could meet . 
  you seem to have it pretty good up there . 
  i 'll tell you one thing though , that `` poutine '' stuff i 'll never get used to . 
  cheese curds are just wrong . 
  from what little i know of louisiana , is n't there the mardi gras as celebrated with drunken debauchery and beads by young people , but then also the `` real mardi gras '' as celebrated in the more rural parts , the more traditional mardi gras , that includes the [ courir de mardi gras ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/courir_de_mardi_gras ) and all the creepy [ dressing up and parading ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=rural+mardi+gras&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiasuetn97kahvnv3ikhygrarwq_auibygb&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=677 ) ? 
  people say it in brabant , that 's all i know . 
  that 's the only reason i 've heard it before ( we have a brabant as well ) . 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  still , happy fat thursday !, 
  the opening day of [ the yalta conference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yalta_conference ) in crimea was 71 years ago today . 
  winston churchill , joseph stalin , and franklin roosevelt came together at yalta to discuss europe 's future , after the war . 
  it was also 13 years ago on this day , februari 4 ^ th , that serbia and montenegro [ were declared a country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbia_and_montenegro#state_union ) , thereby dissolving the federal republic of yugoslavia into a state union . 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/43ra8g/what_do_you_guys_think_europe_will_look_like_in/czkvlg8?context=3 comments written at 2 in the morning often feature errors , if it 's any excuse . 
  that was a bit of a silly mix-up . 
  in my defence , it was quite late and i 'd had a few drinks . 
  as we 've been saying to the water for our entire existence : challenge excepted , my friend . 
  what a headline . 
  [ dutchness ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo8dlbksw_w ) . 
  the us anthem is pretty good , but it has nothing on the russian anthem . 
  in my opinion la marseillaise , the flower of scotland , and mazurek d\u0105browskiego are the greatest national anthems . 
  it does n't actually rain * that * much , our incessant complaining about it just makes it seem that way . 
  i mean , it does rain quite a lot , but you know what i mean . 
  this should be an interesting thread to take a peak at in a few hours ... , 
  have you been to turkey ? 
  turkish people come in many , many different shades , some turks have white skin , some have almost dark-brown skin , and every shade in between is represented . 
  i 've been to turkey many times , and there are a lot of turks living in the netherlands , and quite a lot of them have skin as white as mine . 
  it has n't changed my life one bit . 
  i 'm not a particularly politically correct person , but the way some people act like political correctness is this great terrible evil force that has come to destroy our world and is worse than hitler and aids combined and mankind has never been so horribly oppressed etc. 
  is just pathetic . 
  beautiful . 
  the wonderful world of modern day headlines . 
   `` the destiny of this earth lies in the race , '' one user who goes by the name of patron and has a profile picture of a stamp featuring hitler and the nazi flag wrote in one post . 
   another user posted internet links on `` race purity '' . 
  ah , / r/european regulars . 
  wow , great photo . 
  slow newsday , huh ? 
  he could have made a post like this about any of the european colonising countries , and they 'd all have no shortage of horrendous atrocities . 
   murcian i believe they speak a closely related language in some parts of alabama and mississippi . 
  nothing you 've said makes any sense , nor does it bear any relevance to the topic this thread is about . 
  you come across like a halfwit . 
  why not have him over ? 
  have you heard him speak ? 
  it 's hilarious . 
  lol . 
  never mind , i thought you were being serious . 
  it obviously has nothing to do with them being spanish descendants , that does n't make sense on any level . 
  enjoy the rest of your day . 
  goodbye . 
  here 's a tip : when someone gives a number of reasons why one set of countries is in better shape than another set of countries , that is * literally * the opposite to claiming it 's all a coincidence and random chance . 
  have a good one .
