  apparently , `` in 1880 , about eight million people in france spoke french as a first language ; 32 million did n't , and of those that did , fewer than half could write it properly . 
  53 of the 89 d\u00e9partements were non-french speaking . 
  the language of the revolution , * la libert\u00e9 * and the * academie francaise * was a minority language in france until well into the 20th century . '', 
  i did get those numbers from qi , so they might not be entirely accurate . 
  oh wow , thanks for explaining , that 's quite fascinating . 
  in terms of being divided within your own country it 's similar to the way it was in most countries in mainland europe i suppose . 
  i know that even in the late 19th century less than a quarter of french people spoke french as a first language and everyone still spoke various older languages in various regions ; bretons , occitan , basque , franco-proven\u00e7al etc. 
  my own country had a similar sort of deal with the various duchies and such fighting each other for centuries . 
  do the packs in the uk have those pictures of the messed up organs and stuff on them ? 
  because those are terrifying , we do n't have those . 
  i imagine having that would prevent/reduce smoking a fair bit . 
  ours just have warnings in words that i always just ignored . 
  ah , that makes sense actually . 
  still weird that they would provide a stat like that and not provide any further information . 
  i was wondering the whole time : why would they want to make the roads safer for only half of the people , surely if road-safety is your concern you would try to make it safer for both genders ... and then i read  spokesperson for sheilas ' wheels said : `` as the uk 's leading car insurer for women , ah , they do n't care about men 's safety on the road because men are n't their customers . 
  since when are there gender-exclusive car insurers anyway ? 
  just seems odd . 
   men were involved in 114,190 traffic accidents compared to just 70,470 for women , but 53 % of women involved in a traffic accident are badly injured , compared to just 38 % of men . 
  how is that possible ? 
  do women tend to get into more severe accidents in general ? 
  they could have expounded a little further . . or just explained even somewhat why the numbers are like that . . 
  how divided or ` separate ' were these clans ? 
  was it just family names or were they actually clearly defined , conflicting groups ? 
  i must admit i know very little of the history of ireland pre-18th century . 
  does increasing the amount of health warnings on those packets really reduce smoking ? 
  i smoked for 15 years , there were always health warnings on the packs , i never cared even slightly about them . 
  obviously , i now wish i had , but i did n't and neither did any smokers i knew . 
   we are building a coalition of respectable centre-right parties like the akp ? 
  this whole article is just laughable . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/2014/09/19/russian-soldiers-reveal-truth-behind-putins-secret-war-269227.html ) newsweek article ( also linked to in the article op posted ) is quite a fascinating read about the russian soldiers who have died so far in ukraine being secretly buried in russia . 
  i sometimes think you could have a thread about oven-gloves on this sub and someone will still manage to turn it into an anti-immigrant thing . 
  that 's true . 
  fantastic news , for everyone in tunisia . 
  i was n't aware tunisia was part of europe , but good for them anyway . 
  the fucked up thing is i think he might actually be serious . 
  the man 's a halfwit . 
  again dude , you can keep making the same false accusations , but the fact remains i said my government would n't recognize the state of palestine , because they know it would piss off the us , and my government 's policy is to never do anything that might piss off the us . 
  simple . 
  you keep harping on about my use of the word lapdog , and simply refuse to actually address what i 've said . 
  it 's an easy way to think you 've won an argument , just ignore the opponent and make up an opponent of your own . 
  then when he says something like `` that means the dutch government makes a choice not to recognize palestine , by itself . '', 
  clearly indicating i believe this to be an independent act by the government , you can ignore that and just say `` you 're absolving your government of any culpability by claim their actions are only because of american meddling '' as if i said the opposite to what i said . 
  you 're living in * your * reality , which repeatedly proves itself to be the opposite to * the * reality . 
  remember the bit where i claimed my government only acts on american meddling ? 
  i know you remember it well , but you should n't , because i literally never said that , and said the opposite multiple times . 
  just keep ignoring the conversation and keep having your own conversation with the man in your head , it 's much easier that way . 
  here it is , for the last time : i have never , in my entire life , not even once , claimed that the us controls my country 's government , or that it `` meddles '' in it . 
  never . 
  i 'm the guy who regularly tells conspiracy theorists to piss off , i 've got plenty karma on / r/conspiratard for making fun of conspiracy theorists , and nothing but negative karma on / r/conspiracy for calling them out on their bullshit , but in your head i 'm a conspiracy theorist . 
  you know , the opposite of what is true . 
  i have been calling for an abolishment of the royal house of my country for twenty years , and have referred to my country on its national sub as `` a steaming pile of shit that get 's smellier every day , i 'm moving away from here as soon as i can '' , but in your head i 'm a nationalist , the opposite of what is true . 
  i 've said multiple times in your fun little back-and-forth that i do not believe the us controls my government in any way , but that my government openly goes out of its way to keep the us happy with it , but you 've repeatedly claimed i said the us controls my government , you know , the opposite of what is the case . 
  i suggest you keep arguing with the completely inaccurate version of me you see in your silly mind , and stop regurgitating the same shite to the real me . 
  we must find 4chan and stop him !, 
  i 'm only going to repeat this one more time now , as i know it 's as pointless now as it was every other time , since you 're just going to draw your own conclusions to make me fit with the image in your thick head : i have never , in my entire life , not even once , claimed that the us controls my country 's government , or that it `` meddles '' in it . 
  never . 
  in fact i 've told other people to fuck off at times for claiming the us controls our government.the premise for all you 've said ( me claiming it 's the us controlling my government ) is entirely false . 
  i have , however , on numerous occasions complained about the actions of my government , amongst other things just now when i complained about my government refusing to recognize palestine . 
  all the things you think i said i only said in your head , because you , instead of reading and understanding what i said , had a picture of me all drawn up in your head where i 'm some sort of nationalist conspiracy theorist , well i 'm in fact the exact opposite , you 're just an imbecile with a bit of confirmation bias and a slightly weak grasp on the english language . 
  good lord , you are baffelingly simple . 
  fine , let 's take a look at my original comment . 
  smacksaw said , speaking of sweden recognizing palestine `` i wonder who will follow suit , probably ireland . '', 
  to which i replied `` i hope it 's us , but it wo n't be . 
  our government has been america 's lapdog for some time now . '' . 
  if we examine that sentence we can work out what i was saying : i said i hope my country would be the next to recognize the palestinian state , but that i had little hope that it would be . 
  i then explained why the dutch government would n't recognize palestine ( hint : that means * the dutch government makes a choice * not to recognize palestine , by itself . 
  it ** does not mean ** the us government will determine whether or not the dutch government recognizes palestine , as you moronically accused me of implying ) , namely because they know it would annoy america , our biggest and best bud ( if you knew dutch history of the past few decades you 'd know the dutch government basically always does what it knows wo n't piss off the us , in fact the previous pm openly admitted it to be his general policy : whatever keeps the us our friends , that 's what we do ) . 
  this would be because the dutch government , these past two decades , has been america 's lapdog : always making sure to do what it knows will not displease america . 
  at no point did it imply `` meddling by amerikkka '' or `` being controlled by amerikkka '' ( btw dude , this is n't middle-school . 
  no one thinks you 're cool for spelling it ` amerikkka ' , we just think you 're a child ) . 
   that 's bullshit , they are quite capable of making their own decisions for their interests and they do . 
  that 's * exactly what i said * , dumbass . 
  they make their own decision not to recognize palestine , for their interests ( these interests being : not pissing off their biggest partner , the us ) and fuck them for making that decision , is what i was saying . 
   but god forbid you took responsibility for your own actions , always need a scapegoat . 
  my own actions ? 
  if it were up to me my country would have recognized palestine decades ago . 
  who 's this scapegoat then ? 
  i 'm saying ( again , try to follow along and think about what the words i 'm saying mean rather than trying to fit me into your image of me ) ** i do n't like my government not recognizing palestine ** , the scapegoat i 'm blaming here is ... my government ? 
  that 's who i 'm blaming , because that 's who is refusing to recognize palestine . 
  i 'm blaming the people who refuse to recognize palestine for not recognizing palestine . 
  a scapegoat is when you blame someone else , it is not when you blame the actual people responsible . 
  you do understand that it is up to my government , not up to me , to recognize the palestinian state ? 
   my mistake , i did n't realize you were an actual 10-year . 
   this is your brain on nationalism . 
  the netherlands , perfect and would always do the popular thing ... if it was n't for meddling amerikkka . 
  i 'm a nationalist for calling you a 10-year old ?? 
  again , your logic is retarded . 
  if you knew anything about me you 'd know that i 'm as far from being a nationalist as is possible . 
  `` the netherlands , perfect and would always do the popular thing '' , this is what you got from what i said ? 
  from me literally complaining about my country you inferred that i think my country to be perfect ? 
  that 's the opposite of the case , you moron . 
  i 'm saying fuck my country for not recognizing palestine and you reply with `` oh , the netherlands always perfect . . '' , what the actual fuck . 
  it 's like if i said `` i hate apples '' and you replied by accusing me of loving apples . 
  it 's simply moronic . 
  all i ever do on here is complain about how much my country sucks , and you interpret me to be a nationalist who thinks my country is always perfect and always does the right thing when i 'm literally complaining about my country not recognizing palestine . 
  i think you need some lessons in english , more than anything , as you seem incapable of reading things and working out what those things actually mean , instead you choose to interpret them in whichever way fits your view of the person saying them best . 
  ** in closing , read this a few times and let it sink into your thick skull : i have never , in my entire life , not even once , claimed that the us controls my country 's government , or that it `` meddles '' in it . 
  never . 
  the premise for all you 've said ( me claiming it 's the us controlling my government ) is entirely false . 
  i have , however , on numerous occasions complained about the actions of my government , amongst other things just now when i complained about my government refusing to recognize palestine .
