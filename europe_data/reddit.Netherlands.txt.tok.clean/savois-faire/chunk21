  right , that 's why ch ( westerners ) depict him that way . 
  ` him ' being god , the deity worshiped by christians , muslims , and jews . 
  makes sense they would depict him the way god is always depicted in western culture . 
  western \u2260 christian , by the way . 
   islam strictly forbids any depiction of god . 
  right , but ch are n't muslims , so that does n't come into play for them in any way . 
  it just means we do n't have a version of a depiction of god from any islamic cultures to go by , all the more reason to draw him the way you 've always drawn him . 
   i see the triangle on his head as a clear reference to trinity it 's very obviously the eye of providence , which is a re-branding of the eye of horus , and can be seen in the symbolism of most religions . 
  when you look at the ch cover , it really just looks like they 're blaming god/religion for the attacks , which is n't unreasonable from their perspective . 
  they 're not ones to shy away from offending muslims , which is what started all this to begin with , and they 're depicting god in the same way they always have done . 
   christian looking god i 'm not sure what a `` christian looking god '' is supposed to be , the abrahamic faiths ( christianity , judaism , islam , and the offshoots of those religions ) all worship the same god , and the cover ch used does n't have any christian symbolism on it . 
  on the cover , he 's an old man with a long beard and an ak-47 , many would say a man with a long beard and an ak-47 in a cartoon is probably meant to represent a muslim terrorist , many might say otherwise . 
  either way , the point they made is still the same . 
  makes sense . 
  the point made on that ch cover was that religion was the perpetrator , that religion was the reason why the attacks happened ; people acting on behalf of god . 
  that 's why the caption read `` the killer is still out there '' , above the picture of god . 
  i would n't have expected the vatican to be particularly positive about that message . 
   you 'll notice i never said anything about governments . 
  i 'm talking about people on the left arguing from an authoritarian perspective , and people on the right arguing from an authoritarian perspective . 
  this is a phenomenon that has always been around , but it grows and shrinks in waves . 
  its definition . 
  arguing for solutions of an authoritarian nature , to perceived issues in our societies .

  i 'm pretty sure him and that 4chan dude are in cahoots . 
  authoritarianism is found on both sides of the political aisle , and is a terrible thing in both cases . 
  right now the left has taken on an authoritarian nature in many parts of europe , and it 's causing a rise in the authoritarian right , which is a lose-lose situation . 
  i was n't buying that drug story for a second .

  hopefully , all the perpetrators will be caught , arrested , tried , and thrown in jail .

   why do n't you make caricatures of mohammed ? 
  are you afraid ? 
  yeah ok , let 's just make fun of catholics . 
  yeah , those pussies at charlie hebdo would never draw a caricature of mohammed !, 
  plus , god is exclusively a catholic deity , he definitely is n't a common factor across the 3 major abrahamic faiths !, 
  the point of the cover is to say that religion is to blame , people acting on behalf of god . 
  which is a fairly typical cover and message , for ch . 
  none of the western sanctions have included banning and/or removing people from the country based on their nationality or ethnicity . 
  i am from the hague , born and raised , and i can assure you the hague is not considered the capital by anyone here , in any way . 
  the hague performs a lot of the roles and tasks that are * typically * performed by a country 's capital city ( seat of the monarchy , seat of the national legislature and most of the national courts ) , but nobody considers it a second capital . 
  people from the hague like to say that the hague is `` secretly the real capital , and we just let amsterdam take that title so that we do n't get stuck with all the tourists '' , but that 's just a joke . 
  could you name some examples ? 
  ( genuine question , i 'm trying to think of examples but failing ), 
  banning people based on their nationality now ? 
  ah , the good old days of fascism . 
  back in the day they were n't the countries of belgium , luxembourg , and the netherlands ; they were just a collection of separate duchies/counties etc. , and they were collectively known as ` the low lands ' because the characteristic that a lot of them had in common was that they were at least partially below sea-level , so the region is collectively referred to as ` the low lands/countries ' when talking about them in the period of history before they were countries . 
  ` the benelux ' is the name for the three * countries * of belgium , luxembourg , and the netherlands ; ` the low countries ' is the name that is used to refer to that region as it was before they became countries . 
  sometimes people still use the phrase ` the low countries ' to refer to the benelux or certain parts of it , in a romanticizing way . 
  until the 16 ^ th century , the low countries -- corresponding roughly to the present-day netherlands , belgium , and luxembourg -- consisted of a number of duchies , counties , and prince-bishoprics , almost all of which were under the supremacy of the holy roman empire , with the exception of the county of flanders , which was under the kingdom of france . 
  in the 16 ^ th century , a number of these counties and duchies and lordships united as a republic , that would later grow into the country we now know as the netherlands . 
  back when we were a republic , the name of our country was the republic of the seven united netherlands . 
  these 7 previously separate regions , now united into one republic , were the following : 1 . 
  the duchy of guelders 2 . 
  the county of holland 3 . 
  the county of zeeland 4 . 
  the lordship of utrecht 5 . 
  the lordship of overijssel 6 . 
  the lordship of frisia 7 . 
  the lordship of groningen holland was one of the 7 netherlands ( low lands , lands below the sea-level ) to be united as one in this new republic . 
  because this was a new thing , and the notion of a shared national `` netherlander identity '' ( the word ` dutch ' does n't correspond to any actual word from our language , it 's something english-speaking people started incorrectly calling us , and was an anglicization of the word ` deutsch ' , meaning ` german ' ) did n't exist , people back then tended to identify with the previously autonomous region they were from and grew up in . 
  so , most people from frisia considered themselves frisians living in the newly formed republic of the seven united netherlands , most people from zeeland considered themselves zeelanders living in the newly formed republic of the seven united netherlands , most people from holland considered themselves hollanders , etc. 
  there was no real sense of a shared national identity , this would n't come to exist until later , so people identified with the county/duchy/lordship they grew up in . 
  the county of holland , previously an independent county but now a part of a republic , had some major port cities in it : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague . 
  merchants from these cities traveled the world selling spices and other goods , sailing to the new world ( america ) , or the british isles or asia or africa or wherever ; and when the locals asked them where they were from , they would n't say `` we 're from the newly formed republic of the seven united netherlands '' , they would usually just say `` we 're from holland '' . 
  because of this , people around the world started talking about ` those people from holland ' , and it kind of stuck around . 
  that 's how it was always explained to me , anyway . 
  today , the region that was once the county of holland still exists , in the form of 2 provinces : north-holland and south-holland . 
  the other lands still exist as provinces as well , and we 've added a few more provinces on over the years .
