  fuck . . alright , i have to admit , you got me . 
  well done . 
  i should have realised that you 're a troll a lot earlier . 
  i ca n't believe you had to make it this obvious before i spotted it , i feel like an idiot . 
   a man is allowed to show his naked chest publicly , but a woman ca n't do that . 
  that 's because women and men showing their naked chest are different . 
  there are different standards because those things are perceived differently by people . 
  no , that 's because women have breasts on their chest , and to show naked breasts publicly is considered public lewdness . 
  there are different standards because a male chest and a female chest are not the same , because unlike a male chest , a female chest has these two things on it that are legally considered lewd to display publicly ; it has nothing to do with perception . 
  personally i find the notion that a female chest ca n't be displayed publicly ridiculous , but i do n't make the mistake of thinking my personal opinion should dictate what others are and are not allowed to do . 
   similarly , two men kissing is perceived differently than a man and a woman kissing , so it can be treated differently . 
  there is nothing similar about those two cases , the chests and the kissing . 
  you can * perceive * two men kissing differently than you * perceive * a man and a woman kissing , but that does n't change the fact that the act is the same and in both cases does not constitute lewdness , and as such both cases are publicly acceptable . 
  again , it 's fine if you do n't like seeing it , there are tons of things that are legal to display publicly that i do n't like seeing , but that does n't change the point that your opinion of two men kissing is completely irrelevant when it comes to what is socially accepted . 
  the current british government is working hard to undo everything from the human rights act to the very notion of privacy . 
   `` you 're not harmed or offended by two men fucking on the street unless you choose to be '' . 
  it 's like you 're deliberately misunderstanding the point . 
  it 's very simple : any public act of intimacy and affection that is acceptable for heterosexuals should also be acceptable for homosexuals . 
  holding hands in public : acceptable , whether you 're heterosexual or homosexual kissing in public : acceptable , whether you 're heterosexual or homosexual having sex in the street : unacceptable , whether you 're heterosexual or homosexual it 's not that complicated . 
  further down you make the point that you are offended * specifically * by the sight of two men kissing . 
  guess what : just because you 're offended by something , does n't necessarily mean it 's wrong , and it certainly does n't mean that that thing should n't be tolerated , just because * you 're * offended by it . 
  the world does n't revolve around you and your little sensitivities . 
  `` i 'm offended by that '' is n't an argument , it 's merely a statement . 
  if i say `` i 'm offended by the sight of heterosexuals kissing in public '' , that 's not an argument for the case that heterosexuals should n't be allowed to kiss in public , that 's just me stating that i 'm offended by something . 
  i love how romania is combating corruption . 
  it 's kind of sad that the fact that a country is actually doing something about corruption is this refreshing , rare thing , but still . 
  she should * definitely * be fired for that , but i 'm not comfortable with people getting in legal trouble for saying dumb shit , whomever it 's aimed at . 
  on a side note , bahar mustafa is an unbearable twat . 
  the shit that comes out of her mouth is ridiculous . 
  went to prague once when i was 17 . 
  fucking loved it . 
  the beer is delicious and cheap as hell ( at least it was in 2004 , i believe things may have gotten a bit more expensive since then ) , the city is absolutely beautiful , as are the people , they 're incredibly friendly , and the weather was great . 
  saw some gorgeous sites , hung out in some awesome places . 
  as for bad experiences , we did n't really have many , a friend of mine got tricked into buying some hash that turned out not to be hash by some dude while he was out by himself and was pretty bummed about it ( i managed to find some excellent weed later that day to cheer him up again , so it was alright in the end ) , and we had a rather disappointing strip-club experience , but other than that we had the time of our lives . 
  dude , it is n't shopped . 
  i 've been there .

  there 's also the occasional [ giant zebra-crossing ] ( https://fietsenopdefiets.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/p1140237.jpg ) for pedestrians . 
  scary times for turkey . 
  my condolences , man . 
  this is exactly the result none of us wanted to see . 
  it 's a deeply sad day . 
  akp wins . 
  attat\u00fcrk is spinning in his grave . 
  such a sad day . 
  this is horrendous . 
  first the fire in bucharest , and now this . 
  a truly tragic day . 
  my condolences to the victims ' families . 
  i read there were voices heard from under the rubble , hopefully there are many survivors and they will be found . 
  i 'm also saddened to see the amount of people in this thread bringing up mh17 etc. 
  i know most of us here are n't fans of the russian government or the rebels in ukraine , i know i 'm certainly not , but this tragedy has nothing to do with that . 
  let 's just discuss this tragedy respectfully , considering the victims and their families , and not try to make this about other tragedies just because the victims happened to be from russia . 
   assuming people can put their humanity before their fear/xenophobia . 
  not in today 's r/europe , i 'm afraid . 
  any comment regarding the refugees that is n't `` fuck 'em all , i 'll kill one if i see one '' gets downvoted . 
  they 're waiting at a stoplight , they 're not in a traffic jam . . 
   the group won an international press freedom award this year for providing foreign media with credible news while enduring extraordinarily dangerous conditions . 
  no wonder they did n't like them , we all know how the turkish government feels about freedom of the press . . 
  now that 's what i like to see  i 'm assuming the ones wearing helmets are american tourists/expats ? 
  that 's how you recognise them in the netherlands , anyway . . 
  not to be cynical , but i 've heard that said about every generation so far . 
  you have completely misread that . 
  do you really think that that 's what i was saying ? 
  i was saying it is sad that corruption is n't tackled more by the eu , you seem to have somehow assumed i was saying it should n't be , when i was implying it should be but wo n't be . 
  sadly , we all know it wo n't . 
  `` may hit '' ? 
  they 've been attacking the syrian kurds who are actively fighting isis for ages now . 
  well , they lock up every journalist who criticises the regime , so i would n't say it 's surprising to hear . 
  first i 've heard of it , but then i do n't watch that show . 
  congratulations to her , regardless . 
  same could be written about any other city in the netherlands you 'd care to pick , but still , it 's a wonderful thing . 
  denmark : it 's the netherlands , but somewhere else . 
  [ it 's always the same types ] ( http://media.wtfunny.com/content/pictures/suoeqlb672.jpg ), 
  thank you , i probably should have included that . 
  it 's not uncle vlad , it 's the russian political elite as a whole . 
  vlad 's just the man who signs the bill . 
  it would be hard not to have a silent chuckle if that happened . 
  i read the title a little too hastily and thought they 'd somehow moved the election up to today . 
  thanks for the announcement , anyway . 
  there were some pretty good summaries of the various parties ' platforms in / u/the _ naturalist 's thread from yesterday . 
   amsterdam , rotterdam officials attacked in paris suburb  a group of dutch municipal officials from amsterdam , rotterdam and arnhem were attacked in paris on wednesday night . 
  poor little arnhem , can not into headline . 
  good on japan . 
  i wish my government would try to be more like the estonian one . 
  you forgot to pointlessly add a french translation , that nobody needs or wants to read , to your edit . 
  so , he flip-flopped ? 
  shit . . 
  it really is coming . 
  that title is just begging for it . 
  you 're thinking of anders breivik , not anton brevik , and i would argue that both are colossal cunts . 
  edit : spelling, 
   when have i ever spake about those topics , i do n't recall ever doing so . 
  there 's a reason i recognise your username . .  it does n't change the fact your comment breaks the subreddit rules and i 've seen tamer ones removed for less . 
  feel free to report me to the mods if you think so . 
  i have no vested interest in being here . 
  he 's a vile cunt , i called him one . 
  i did n't say `` vile white cunt '' or `` vile christian cunt '' or `` vile swedish cunt '' , just a good old fashioned vile cunt . 
  of course , it 's / u/didijustobama , so why bother . 
  there could be a thread on here about tractor engines and you would find a way to make it about `` the persecution of the white man '' and how all the muslims are evil .
