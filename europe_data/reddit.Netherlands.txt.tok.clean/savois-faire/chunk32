  and i do n't know anything about the man 's culture , as i do n't know him at all ( nor do you , of course ) , but i do know my cousin has stuck with dutch culture all the way ; his living there is purely work-related . 
  so , my cousin who moved to belgium and cares not for its culture is a belgian , but a guy who , if current reports are to be believed ( i tend to be reluctant to trust any and all early reports on a breaking news story , but it 's all we have at the moment ) , was born and raised in belgium and was in the belgian army for years is not ? 
  my cousin has been living in belgium , as a belgian citizen , for 18 years now . 
  100 % dutch , by origin . 
  still eats tons of cheese , still eats raw herring , still supports the dutch football team , still speaks almost no french . 
  has no interest in belgian culture , he moved there for a job he really wanted . 
  so , by your logic , he is n't a belgian either , but merely a `` belgian '' , in quotation marks ? 
  if reports are to be believed , hicham d. was born in belgium , in 1973 . 
  ca n't say that for my cousin . 
  and unlike hicham , my cousin has n't spent years fighting in the belgian army , so he 's probably even more not belgian , by your standards . 
  and of course , as you claim he only joined the belgian army to learn how to kill so he could kill belgians , which is why he waited * eight years * to put his grand master plan of stabbing some guys into motion , which is something that only the military can teach you how to do , of course . 
   unfortunately is not the first nor the most serious . 
  surely the second part of that is fortunate , rather than unfortunate ? 
  the part about it not being the most serious ? 
   one officer was stabbed in the neck and another in the stomach , while a third officer who arrived at the scene in schaerbeek district suffered a broken nose , belgian broadcaster vrt reports . 
  the attacker was shot in the leg and taken away by ambulance . 
   authorities said the officers did not suffer life-threatening injuries . 
  no one 's dead or going to die , and the attacker was captured alive . 
  awful as the news is , those are positives . 
  good . 
  erdogan 's a lunatic , and the last thing we should be doing is going along with his lunacy . 
  he should be called out and ridiculed as often as possible . 
  and if that happens , we will be forced to take the things that that half-witted amphibian in an ill-fitting human costume says seriously . 
  which will not be an easy task . 
   do n't even take him serious well , he is the mayor of your capital city , so it 's likely to be taken seriously . 
   planning an earthquake in \u0130stanbul huh ? 
  yeah , no . 
  je suis iphone . 
   the cot 's makers said they had sold `` around 10 '' of the items , but argued the design was `` nothing unusual '' . 
  `` to honour the hundreds of innocent civilians who died needlessly when the rebels we supply with weapons shot down a civilian airliner , you can now let your children sleep in a bed designed like the weapon that killed so many innocent little children that day . 
  buy it now ! '', 
  ideal works really well , though . 
  no credit cards needed , i 'd take ideal any day . 
  that 's why nobody in the netherlands uses credit cards . 
  crowded . 
   please use a new syringe . 
  someone 's planning quite the trip . 
  i never said any such thing , my opinion is that all such violent attacks on people are bad . 
  your assumptions are your own , do n't place them in my mouth . 
  if you have some information that indicates that the victims of this attack had previously attacked the perpetrators , though , i recommend contacting the local police . 
  instant victim blaming . 
  edit : you never disappoint , my dear subreddit . 
  which angers me to no end . 
  it was pretty clear from the beginning . 
  of course , russia will just claim it 's another grand western conspiracy against russia . 
  we could have told you that two years ago . 
  and we did . 
  do some research into the gang problems of malm\u00f6 . 
  you 'll find native swedes make up the bulk of it . 
  they 've also got a few gangs made up of africans and swedes of african descent , some assyrian/syriac gangs , and a few albanian gangs , but it 's mostly swedes . 
   obviously , we are not supposed to project this positive story onto every single refugee/migrant , but neither should we do so with each negative one . 
  in my experience , this subreddit agrees with you on the first , but strongly disagrees on the second . 
  at least , if the voting patterns are anything to go by . 
  malm\u00f6 always had plenty of problems with gangs before , so if anything the immigrant gangs in malm\u00f6 are appropriating the local gang culture . 
  it 's a gun attack . 
  it says so right in the headline . 
   a witness to the incident said there were around twenty shots fired by people in an audi which then drove off at high speed . 
  it 's from amadeu antonio stiftung . 
  they 're nutjobs . 
  you might be nett , but i 'm netter . 
  no sarcasm . 
  seems like they 're doing some good work down there . 
  edit : and of course i forgot i 'm in r/europe , where everything that portrays refugees as anything other than bloodthirsty scum must be downvoted . 
  up next : more complaints about people enforcing a narrative , because we hate that unless we like the narrative . 
  yay !, 
  seems to be shaping up nicely . 
   i knew australia was expensive but $ 19 for a magazine ?!, 
  have you seen the size of some of the spiders over there ? 
  they need their magazines to be thick as hell . 
  you know they 're going to keep trying . 
  man , moody 's do n't mince their words . 
  is n't it normal for the military to wait until the exact week the head of state is off on vacation to attempt their coup ? 
  you know , the precise week when there 's 0 % chance of the coup succeeding . 
  that 's how it usually happens , i think ... 
  `` pleur op '' is certainly not the most appropriate thing for a pm to say , but it 's not that bad . 
  to translate it as `` fuck off '' is just dumb , because those are not equivalent phrases at all , and it 's also worth bearing in mind the full quote :  `` my first reaction would be : go away . 
  go back to turkey . 
  ` pleur op ' i would say in haags , '' the prime minister said in response , using the expression for `` f -- -- k off '' in the local dialect from the hague . 
  i 'm from the hague , born and raised , still live and work here . 
  ` pleur op ' is not the expression for ` fuck off ' in the `` local dialect '' ( it 's not a dialect , these people do n't know what they 're talking about ) . 
  also , `` x , i would say in haags '' * always * refers to something you know is inappropriate to say in general ( people from the hague are known for swearing a lot/not having the best manners ; ` haags ' refers to `` the language of the hague '' , which is typically full of vulgarity ) . 
  what he 's saying is basically `` where i 'm from we would say ` pleur op ' to these people '' , and he 's speaking in anger . 
  he then went on to explain his actual position , which was far more nuanced . 
  what he actually said amounted to `` where i 'm from we would simply say ` pleur op ' to these people , but of course that is n't the answer '' . 
  but these publications are n't going to let that get in their way . 
  for the record , i am normally not one to defend mr. rutte , i 'm not exactly a fan , but this whole `` controversy '' is a joke . 
  well , that clears that up . 
  we call them chinese apples . 
  `` sinaasappel '' means `` apple of sina '' , which is the old name for china . 
   edit : persian , not farsi . 
  is n't farsi just the persian word for persian ? 
  remember [ this guy ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/politicalvideo/comments/3vxy3l/trump_dares_morning_host_to_go_to_break_guess/cxrsrnk?context=3 ) ? 
  who claimed to know for a fact that all these areas are `` no-go zones for non-muslims '' because `` the sharia patrols are controlling the areas '' , and then when a local called him on his bullshit the guy told him to [ `` go to woolwich holding a bottle of wine and see how quickly your ignorant and protected bubble will burst '' ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/politicalvideo/comments/3vxy3l/trump_dares_morning_host_to_go_to_break_guess/cxrsxcw ) . 
  the guy took him up on the challenge , and it turns out it was n't * his * `` ignorant and protected bubble '' that bursted , [ but the other guy 's ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/politicalvideo/comments/3vxy3l/trump_dares_morning_host_to_go_to_break_guess/cxs4iqa ) . 
  `` i think it was reverend green , with the knife , in the drawing room '', 
  the thought alone makes me nauseous . 
  one does n't exclude the other . 
  here in the hague everyone is all about the raw herring . 
  and as it happens , i do n't like drop either , and i 'm not a massive cheese fan ( although i do like tostis ) . 
  i ate a lot of hagelslag as a child , but not so much as an adult .
