   a lot of boys watch jihadi videos . 
  it 's like people watch pornography . 
  except nowhere near as fun and harmless , and quite terrifying . 
   why is this man not being arrested as we speak ? 
  the whole `` not having committed a crime '' thing sort of gets in the way of that . 
   oh wait , the police do n't want to be branded racist , that must be it yes , the reason the police are not arresting this man who has broken no law is because they 're scared of being branded racist , that must be it indeed . 
  i know a black guy who once said something awful , and the police did n't arrest him either . 
  clearly , they 're scared of being labelled racist and it 's `` political correctness gone mad ! '' . 
  it 's definitely not the fact that he has n't done anything illegal , anyway . 
   really guys , a dude can get arrested in germany for liking a damn facebook post and forced to pay a fine , but this guy , he 's innocent germany has different laws than the uk does . 
  that 's quite common , between different countries . 
   and we ca n't just start arresting and deporting people now can we ? 
  no , we ca n't . 
  not if they have n't done anything illegal , we ca n't . 
  the justice system does n't really work like that . 
  because when a muslim says things we despise , / r/europe immediately gives up on its self-professed support for freedom of speech . 
  if and when this man commits a crime , he should be arrested . 
  as should anyone who has or sells in sex slaves . 
  talking about how and why you believe it should be okay to have sex slaves is not a crime , regardless of how revolting it is . 
  it 's true he 's not english , but then not many people in cardiff are . 
  they tend to be welsh . 
  also , a crime has to be committed before someone can be deported . 
  talking about why you think it 's okay to have sex slaves is not illegal in the uk , as far as i 'm aware . 
  weird , it works fine for me . 
  thanks , anyway . 
  they do n't call us swamp-germans for nothing . 
  i 'm very partial to the [ albanian flag ] ( http://cdn.wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/albania-flag-7.png ) . 
  also a big fan of the flag of [ papua new guinea ] ( http://listosaur.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/papua_new_guinea.jpg ) , but i think my favourite is the [ flag of kiribati ] ( http://www.mapsofworld.com/images/world-countries-flags/kiribati-flag.gif ) . 
  of course the [ flag of nepal ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/flag_of_nepal.svg/2000px-flag_of_nepal.svg.png ) is famous for being the only non-rectangular flag , which makes it pretty unique , but i do n't find it all that special aside from that . 
  and we should definitely not forget [ hong kong ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/flag_of_hong_kong.svg/2000px-flag_of_hong_kong.svg.png ) , which is one of the prettiest flags going . 
  and while i know these are n't countries , in my opinion the best flags in the world are the flag of [ anadyr , chukotka autonomous okrug , russia ] ( http://i0.wp.com/funflagfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/flag_of_anadyr_chukotka.png?fit=1200%2c800&amp;resize=350%2c200 ) , and of course from my own country , [ the flag of hijum ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/n/nl-fr_hj.gif ) . 
  hijum has a great [ coat of arms ] ( http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/images/7/70/hijum.jpg ) , too . 
  seriously , investigate this shit already . 
  and for breitbart it 's their standard mode of operation . 
  edit : mhmm , delicious salt . 
   never change , r/europe . 
  not if / r/europe gets its way it wo n't . 
   i also live in a muslim majority area seven years now , i 'm very happy here . 
  but [ only 36.6 % of the population in darnall ward identify as muslim ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4qm1pz/_/d4vi2t0 ) . 
  that would be a minority muslim area , not a majority muslim area . 
  at a bank . 
   how many hooligans have you seen killing journalists giving their team crap ? 
  hardly any , but even if it happened every day , i still would be opposed to making their football jerseys illegal for anyone to wear . 
  you can point to a million acts of violence committed by muslim psychopaths , but taking away people 's right to freely wear what clothes they like , be it a burqa or a t-shirt , is still wrong . 
  and just like the football jerseys worn by hooligans , banning the clothing does nothing to stop the violence . 
  let me put it this way : the north-eastern provinces of india have a lot of problems with christian terrorist movements . 
  they cause all sorts of havoc , and commit atrocious acts of violence and terrorism . 
  if the indian government were to argue that they must make it illegal for anyone to wear a cross around their neck because the christian terrorists that plague their north-east wear those , i would be against that for the same reason . 
  although the comparison sort of falls apart there , because i do n't know of very many terrorists who wore burqas when they attacked , as they tend to be males , so it 's not great as a direct comparison , given that in the india example the people doing the terrorism actually wear the items of clothing being banned in this hypothetical , when the burqa that france seeks to ban is not something commonly worn by europe 's islamic terrorists , given that they 're usually men . 
  but you get the point . 
   furthermore you compare the fanatic muslims to football hooligans . 
  i at no point compared the two . 
  i mentioned an incident where i was attacked by some football hooligans , as an example of people being attacked in the street for expressing themselves a certain way ( in these cases , through clothing ) . 
   do you not see a problem to the massive display of intolerance ? 
  yes , i see a big problem . 
  but we 're talking about making items of clothing illegal . 
  islamic cultures generally being notably intolerant is a terrible thing . 
  but banning items of clothing is a completely different matter of discussion . 
   you say that violence can happen for millions of reasons . 
  i do agree but i am kind of troubled by the prevalence of violence in a certain demographic . 
  a demographic that actually excuses violence for religious and honor reasons . 
  as am i. i have zero tolerance for people trying to force their religious beliefs on others , as well as for people trying to get away with acts of violence because of their religion . 
  i also have zero tolerance for people trying to take away the freedom to express yourself how you please , to wear what items of clothing you choose to wear , and say whatever you like , without the government intervening and making any of those things illegal for you to do . 
   the particular problem with the burqa and other religious related extreme practices in europe is that they restrict my freedoms i do n't see how someone else freely wearing a burqa because they want to restricts your freedom . 
  you have the same freedom to wear whatever you like . 
   let me give you an absurd example for argument 's sake . 
  what if i ( a man ) wear a burqa with a slogan condemning women oppression on it and go for a walk in the neighborhood you mention ? 
  will i be free to do it unhassled or will i be labelled as racist ? 
  will i be threatened with violence ? 
  in my neighbourhood , which is like 75 % muslim , you 'd be fine . 
  you might get some things yelled at you ( which is not and should not be illegal ) , as people will assume you 're a muslim woman , and some of the more asshole-ish locals might give you some verbal abuse , because `` you 're not supposed to use the burqa for that '' . 
  people give other people walking down the street verbal abuse all the time , in every country in the world . 
  freedom of speech covers insults as well as compliments . 
   as the danish newspaper , charlie hebdo and pim fortuyn murder proved our nations can not guarantee our freedom of speech that was fought for and won over centuries . 
  freedom of speech means you can say what you want without government censorship , or legal persecution . 
  freedom of speech is not the same thing as freedom from consequences of speech , it protects against government intrusion , not people who do n't like you attacking you . 
  this can happen for millions of different reasons , and does all the time , and it 's an illegal act regardless of which reason it happens for . 
  the people who do these things are scumbags , and criminals , but they 're not infringing on your right to freedom of speech , and if you think they are you 're mistaken about the definition of freedom of speech . 
  they 're being deplorable cunts , but that 's another matter . 
   now you may think that i am anti-muslim or something . 
  i do n't think that . 
   as long as i am allowed to express myself freely and in safety , do whatever you want . 
  you are allowed to express yourself freely , for now . 
  if this proposal goes through , freedom of expression ( which includes the freedom to wear what clothes you like ) takes yet another blow in the name of an illusion of increased safety ( there 's a quote about what happens to those who sacrifice liberty for a sense of security ) . 
  as for expressing yourself in safety , no one has ever had that guarantee , anywhere in the world , at any point in time . 
  i once got attacked in the street for wearing another city 's football team 's jersey . 
  the best you can hope for when you 're physically assaulted by some maniac is justice in retrospect . 
   the burqa ( whatever your stance on liberty to wear one ) is demeaning for women , at least for a westerner that believes in equal rights ( other cultures do not believe in the equality of genders ) i believe in equal rights , and i abhor the cultures that are prevalent in the middle east , that treat women as lesser than men . 
  i also abhor people who want to limit people 's freedom to dress how they please . 
  if i * want * to wear a burqa , i should be allowed to , it 's a free country ( or , it 's supposed to be ) . 
  if some woman * wants * to wear a burqa , she should be allowed to . 
  regardless of how you feel about other cultures , this is about the freedom to decide for yourself what you want to say/wear , or how you want to express yourself . 
  that 's what we 're supposed to have that makes our culture better than those cultures . 
  it does n't seem like the french government cares much about that libert\u00e9 they were supposed to be all about , these days . 
  their government gets more and more oppressive . 
  i hope this ban gets stuck down . 
   so according to the french way of thinking a burqa wearing woman can not possibly have chosen to wear it , even is she says so . 
  she is a victim of her repressive culture and must be liberated , by force if necessary . 
  i literally ( in the real definition of the word ` literally ' , not the common online definition where it means the opposite ) know women whose own mothers do n't even wear anything to cover themselves up , and who are not asked by * anyone * to cover themselves up , but wear things like the hijab or the burqa because they personally want to . 
  it 's good luck for them that they live in the netherlands , and not france , where the government apparently would presume , on their behalf , that they are being forced to do something they 're not , and then * force them against their will * to do something ( all while calling * others * oppressive ) .
