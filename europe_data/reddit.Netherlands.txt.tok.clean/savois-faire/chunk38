  it 's ironic that they would force something on them against their will for doing something that they falsely believe them to be doing against their will , but more than that it 's presumptive , patronizing , and frankly plain wrong . 
  this ` french way of thinking ' , as you describe it , does n't sound great ; it sounds like it involves forcing people to do things against their will . 
   she is a victim of her repressive culture except in the cases i described they 're doing it 100 % voluntarily , so they were not being a victim of a repressive culture , but they would subsequently be a victim of a government that wo n't let its people dress ** how they want to dress ** , which is kind of oppressive . 
  well , yeah , and the russian government knows it . 
  but a big enough chunk of their people will willingly believe it , and that 's the point . 
  i know plenty of people who wear a burqa because they want to ( i live in a majority muslim area ) . 
  i think people should be free to dress how they choose . 
   whenever i tell people in this subreddit ( or elsewhere really ) that they should treat people as individuals and judge them based on their own actions and words rather than where they come from or their religion , i 'm looked at with suspicion or even called some sort of `` super leftist libtard jihadi apologist blargh '' . 
  you got called a `` leftist libtard '' for advocating * against * collectivist thinking ? 
  it 's funny , there are some on the right who are fully capable of seeing the flaws of collectivist thinking when it comes to * them * being persecuted or treated differently as the result of the actions of other people they happen to have something in common with , but when those same people want to persecute muslims or whomever it is they want to go after , suddenly they embrace this kind of thinking immediately . 
  there are idiots on all sides of the political aisle . 
  wow ... did the turkish government put that out ? 
  because that is some full-blown ussr style propaganda . 
  let 's not make this a competition , guys . 
  in fairness , i do n't trust the russian police , either . 
   i thought that calvinism was one of the nicest denominations given what a big part the calvinist movement played in our history , any dutchman can tell you that is not the case . 
  the calvinists are like the salafists of christianity , in some ways . 
  [ they even take the same approach to images of the prophet . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beeldenstorm ) the protestant reformation was a pretty violent affair , in the netherlands . 
  in many ways it is . 
  urk is `` the capital of the dutch bible belt '' . 
  it 's nutjob city , basically . 
  they have the highest birth rate of any place in the country by far ( because condoms are made by the devil ) , and they seem to be the main reason the sgp still exists . 
  the sgp is a national political party of ultra-conservative christians . 
  they 're known for wanting to replace the constitution with one based on `` biblical law '' , fighting tooth and nail to maintain their stance that women should not be allowed to vote , wanting a `` vloekverbod '' which makes it illegal to curse ( some towns in the bible belt have actually already enacted this , on the initiative of the sgp ) , wanting to re-criminalize abortion , all drugs , euthanasia , and prostitution , and to make it illegal for gay people to have sex , get married , or adopt children . 
  in the 2012 election the sgp got 2 % of the vote , nation wide , but in urk more than 50 % of residents voted for them . 
  i 'm talking about op , i live in the hague . 
  there 's no way i 'd ever move to urk , not in a million years . 
  and if i were from there , i 'd move away the first chance i got . 
  we do have seasons . 
  we have the season when it 's really cold and it rains a lot , we have the season when it 's even colder and it sometimes snows , and we have the season when the weather is mild and it rains a lot . 
  inb4 the same old dutch `` summer is my favourite day of the year ! '', 
  jokes . 
  i can confirm that we do . 
  i did n't know what i had walked into , there was this weird round yellow thing in the sky , and it seems to have quite an effect on the country , because i was experiencing all kinds of weird new feelings . 
  living in urk . 
  had n't read that one yet . 
  thanks . 
  [ all i could think of , reading your insane ramblings throughout this thread ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jprmmmynyo ), 
  god damn that looks delicious . 
  why you got ta do this to me man , i 'm stuck at work . 
   described as dark skinned so take your guess i did n't see any such description in the article , do you have a source i 'm unaware of ? 
  it does say the attacker was dressed in all black and wearing a motorcycle helmet , but nothing other than that . 
  this is amazing . 
  as someone who always loved turkey , i just hope the turkish people will be rid of that maniac erdogan before it 's too late . 
  i used to visit it regularly , and i would disagree . 
  in many ways a troubled country , though , but that goes for most . 
   half of northern europe looks like that . 
  it 's not interesting for foreign tourists . 
  perhaps not for foreign tourists from northern europe , but op never specified where he/she 's from . 
  the `` i want to visit places in europe '' bits make me suspect they might not be from europe in the first place . 
  it 's a stunningly gorgeous park , great place to visit , i 'd recommend it to anyone . 
  the byzantine empire was not a country . 
  as you 're perfectly aware , i 'm referring to the republic of turkey . 
  just a shame it makes for such a depressing reality in what was once a great country , today .

  nah , ted was [ victoria woodhull ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/victoria_woodhull.jpg ) , the first woman to run for president of the us . 
  i do n't think many people here thought he was referring to the painter who died 125 years ago , when discussing acts of terrorism in the netherlands since the 1970s . 
  [ americans ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ketchup_as_a_vegetable ), 
  on * cheese * ? 
  there are roughly 44 million muslims in europe ( excluding turkey ) . 
  there are roughly 1.1 million buddhists in europe . 
  that means there are roughly 40 times as many muslims in europe ( excluding turkey ) as there are buddhists . 
  muslims make up roughly 7 % of europe 's population , buddhists make up roughly 6 % of the world 's population . 
  of course there have n't been many attacks by buddhists in europe , where there are almost none . 
  but there have been plenty of attacks in places where there is a high concentration of buddhist fundamentalists . 
  a high concentration of religious fundamentalists leads to attacks . 
  similarly , christian terrorism in the north-eastern provinces of india and certain parts of africa , islamic terrorism in the middle east , etc. 
  [ `` myanmar 's buddhist terrorism problem '' - al jazeera america ] ( http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/2/myanmars-buddhist-terrorism-problem.html ) [ `` why are buddhist monks attacking muslims ? '', 
  - bbc news ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22356306 ) [ `` extremist buddhist monks fight oppression with violence '' - time magazine ] ( http://world.time.com/2013/06/20/extremist-buddhist-monks-fight-oppression-with-violence/ ), 
  do n't even need to read the article , it 's right there in the headline ( and would have been in the post title too , if op had n't editorialized ) . 
  i 'm not arguing that it 's completely proportional , i never have . 
  islamic fundamentalism is a problem ( as are all forms of religious fundamentalism ) , and it 's a big one that we currently face . 
  it 's leading to horrific incidents of terrorism , and our representatives have n't done much of anything about it . 
  what i 'm saying is , every time there is an attack , / r/europe goes into collective `` see ?!, 
  we must get rid of all the [ insert groups here ] ! '', 
  mode . 
  which is why , after several stories that / r/europe hyped up massively because they thought they were cases of islamic terrorism , only to be disappointed , there is such renewed fervor of `` this means we have to do x , y , and z to [ insert groups here ] '' in this thread . 
  the crime committed by the guy in munich has been committed countless times before , by people who were not third world immigrants . 
  the same goes for the crime committed by the guy in reutlingen . 
  in fact , the same even goes for the crime this very thread is about . 
  only when it * is * committed by people who are third world immigrants , * then * that is suddenly relevant and means we have to do x , y , and z to [ insert groups here ] . 
  when committed by people who are not , then it 's just another statistic and does n't mean anything . 
  because the guy in munich turned out not to be an islamic terrorist , and the guy in reutlingen turned out not to be an islamic terrorist , so now that the / r/europe crowd has finally gotten what it wants , it 's time for a celebration . 
  it 's the state of the subreddit , these days . 
   because when a man kills a ~ ~ co-worker ~ ~ woman for rejecting him the woman was his co-worker . 
  they both worked at the kebab shop . 
  your `` correction '' was unnecessary .
