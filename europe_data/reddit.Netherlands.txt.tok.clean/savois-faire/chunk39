  they worked together , they had a big fight , after which he killed her . 
   yes , that is a muslim thing . 
  then how come i was able to find dozens of examples of christians and other non-muslims doing the exact same thing , in less than a minute ? 
  `` guy has fight with woman who rejected him , kills woman '' , that headline is not uncommon , and unfortunately for you , it 's does n't only apply to muslims . 
  it applies to the 14 non-muslims i started listing earlier , for a start . 
  i 'm a journalist , i 've seen those stories before , and if you think they were all about muslims you 're mistaken . 
   just like honor killing your own daughter by stoning . 
  i lived in a majority muslim neighbourhood in the hague for 7 years , and nobody ever stoned any daughters , or engaged in any honour killings . 
  the very notion was considered barbaric and wrong . 
  this story has nothing to do with honour killings though . 
  sure , you can point to examples of honour killing in islamic communities . 
  i can point to examples of honour killings in non-islamic communities , too . 
  i could even quote passages from the bible that say you should stone your daughter to death under certain circumstances . 
  that does n't mean that every incident where a christian person kills a woman is a piece of evidence that christianity is barbaric and should be gotten rid of ; we know that not to be the case , because we know crimes like that happen all the time ( case in point : the story in question now ) . 
   here 's an example : http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/sickening-isis-video-shows-moment-4475785  i advise you to not watch that video , though . 
  it 's brutal . 
  yeah , as a journalist , i 've seen more than my fair share of isis videos already . 
  religious fundamentalists are fucking psychopaths . 
  personally , i 'm not aware of any evidence that the guy in reutlingen was an isis member , but if any comes out i 'll be sure to let you know ( although i would n't hold your breath ) . 
  earlier this year , a christian man in pittsburgh killed a woman because she rejected him and he could n't deal with it . 
  when are the americans finally going to stand up and admit they have a christian problem ?!, 
  because it `` definitely has to do with religion '' !, 
  after all , here we have a crime of passion where a guy killed a woman for rejecting him after they had a fight , and he was a muslim , and therefore this is about islam . 
  so when we have a crime a passion where a guy killed a woman for rejecting him , and he was a christian ( which happens just as well ) , it must therefore be about christianity . 
   on tuesday , 24-year-old caroline e. nosal has the misfortune of becoming madison , wisconsin 's first homicide in 2016 . 
  nosal was murdered by co-worker christopher o\u2019kroley , 26 , because she turned down his romantic advances . 
  surely christopher o'kroley must be a muslim , because when a man kills a co-worker for rejecting him ( like the muslim man in this news story ) it 's clearly a muslim thing . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/woman-shot-and-killed-after-rejecting-mans-advances-at-a-bar-a6835256.html  cbs said that police believe ms talton , the sister of pennsylvania state rep ed gainey , was shot by a man who had approached her at the bar , but had been rebuffed . 
   they said the man , 41-year-old charles mckinney , then followed her outside where he shot her . 
  sounds like a muslim name if ever i 've heard one . 
  but we do n't need the name to go on , because we 've already established that this is a muslim issue , so he has to be a muslim ...  https://mic.com/articles/135394/14-women-were-brutally-attacked-for-rejecting-men-why-arent-we-talking-about-it oh , gosh , here 's 14 examples of women killed by men for rejecting their advances . 
  i ca n't wait to find out who the 14 muslims that killed them are . 
  let 's have a look . 
  oh , two of them we 've already discussed , that only leaves 12 other must-be-muslims . 
  let 's see :  adrian loya was reportedly `` obsessed '' with lisa trubnikova , one of his colleagues , who was married and repeatedly turned him down . 
  he planted bombs outside her house before breaking in with 3 rifles and a handgun , and killing her . 
  damn , i do n't know much about adrian loya , but i know he must be a muslim . 
  why is it always colleagues , as well ? 
   darryll guillyard must be a muslim  alexander kozark muslim . 
  after all , this is a muslim issue . 
   over the course of a week , tyrelle shaw attacked four different asian women in the street , hitting them in the face with a heavy object . 
  must be a muslim . 
  oh god , another 8 definite muslims to go , i 'm getting tired . . give me a moment, 
  not known at this point . 
  probably a muslim , given he was originally from syria , and syrians are mostly muslims . 
  his religion is n't really relevant though , as this is a crime of passion . 
  man ca n't deal with woman 's rejection , kills her . 
  happens all the time . 
  earlier this year , in pittsburgh , a man murdered a woman he was in love with after she rejected him . 
  he happened to be a christian . 
  this guy who killed a woman he was in love with after she rejected him was a muslim . 
   it is fun how a rough summary of the police-report gets downvoted . 
  congrats for all the people that hate facts !, 
  it 's r/europe . 
  only facts that support the demanded narrative are upvoted , the rest get downvoted . 
  what a cunt . 
  it 's a memorial , behave yourself . 
   a common pseudonym for a place where acts of disturbing sexual conduct , preferably rape , has occurred , as was the case in the movie `` midnight express '' . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen the words `` preferably rape '' put together before . 
  i 'm confused . 
  if i witness a situation in which an armed man is actively attacking people in the street with a machete , and i 'm in a position to stop that man from carrying on with attacking people with a machete , i 'll do it . 
  i 'd try not to kill the guy in the process , and just incapacitate him instead , and if he did die i would regret his death , but i would n't for a second feel bad about intervening when a guy is attacking people with a machete . 
  the guy is an unforgivable cunt , he should have been stopped the moment after he killed his first victim . 
  sorry if that 's `` bad '' . 
  if i were in a car i 'd be a lot less worried about approaching a guy wielding a machete than i would be if i were not in a car . 
  i 'd run the guy over in a heartbeat if he was slashing people down in the street . 
  a maniac brandishing a machete attacking people in the street should be stopped , and if i were in a car i 'd consider myself in a great position to do it . 
  ironically , separatism is strictly forbidden under russian law . 
   no shit who would want another country to exist inside their borders ? 
  i always say the same thing about limburg , but nobody ever listens to me . 
  it 's not so much a ` problem ' as it is a reason to laugh at the turkish government . 
  what an utterly stupid thing to do . 
  of course , it then reminds you of what the turkish government does in regards to kurdistan and certain events involving armenia , and then it becomes sad again . 
  surely , kind and benevolent mr. erdogan would never try to interfere in the goings on in other countries ? 
  i 'd be shocked . . 
  sane people of turkey , get out while you still can . 
  please . 
  not actually from my country , but i 'll take any opportunity to promote [ m\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res ] ( http://www.msf.org/ ) . 
  it 's looking like a murder/suicide at this point . 
   william shakespeare boring , poetry/literature shite [ mfw ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bto4xis.gif ), 
  meh , without the fog it would n't look much different to any other city . 
  the first that come to mind are : ** [ baruch spinoza ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baruch_spinoza ) ** : dutch philosopher . 
  laid the groundwork for the enlightenment and modern biblical criticism , including modern conceptions of the self and the universe . 
  considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy . 
  ** [ william of orange ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_i_of_orange ) ** ( that 's the one * we * call william of orange , not the one the british call william of orange ; we call him william iii ) : known as willem de zwijger ( ` william the silent ' is the usual translation , there is no english verb that corresponds to the dutch verb ` zwijgen ' , which means ` to remain silent ' , so they went with the adjective instead ) , he is considered our single founding father , and was the leader of the dutch revolt against spain , which led to the eighty years ' war , which led to the forming of the republic of the seven united netherlands , which was the first form of the country that would eventually become the netherlands ( before this , what is now the netherlands was an area consisting of various duchies , counties , and prince-bishoprics , which were all subjects of the holy roman empire ) . 
  he is also the founder of the house of orange-nassau , which remains our royal family to this day . 
  ** [ michiel de ruyter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michiel_de_ruyter ) ** : he is the most famous and one of the most skilled admirals in dutch history , most famous for his role in the anglo-dutch wars of the 17th century . 
  he fought the english and french and scored several major victories against them , the best known probably being the raid on the medway . 
  the pious de ruyter was very much loved by his sailors and soldiers , who gave him his most well known nickname : besteva\u00ear ( older dutch for ` grandfather ' . ), 
  ** [ hugo de groot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hugo_grotius ) ** : dutch jurist who laid the foundations for international law ( along with francisco de vitoria and alberico gentili ) , based on natural law . 
  he was arrested and imprisoned for his involvement in the religious disputes of the republic , but escaped hidden in a chest of books ( in the newly founded republic of the seven united netherlands , there were various schools of protestantism that were fighting over dominance ; biggest among these were the very strict ` gomarists ' , led by franciscus gomarus , and the more moderate ` arminians ' , led by jacobus arminius ) . 
  he wrote most of his major works in exile in france . 
  the arminians were ultimately defeated with the public execution of their most powerful supporter in the republic : johan van oldenbarnevelt . 
  ** [ johan van oldenbarnevelt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_van_oldenbarnevelt ) ** : a statesman who played an important role in the dutch struggle for independence from spain . 
  he was a supporter of the arminians , a personal friend of hugo de groot , and also supported william of orange in his revolt against spain , and fought in william 's army . 
  he was arrested in 1618 for his position within dutch protestantism ( like his friend hugo de groot , he supported the arminians ) , along with de groot and a bunch of others . 
  while de groot escaped from his imprisonment , van oldenbarnevelt was brought in front of what was essentially a kangaroo court , in which the judges were stacked against him , and was sentenced to death . 
  aged 71 , he was beheaded in the hague at the binnenhof . 
  ** [ antonie van leeuwenhoek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonie_van_leeuwenhoek ) ** : a dutch tradesman and scientist . 
  he is commonly known as `` the father of microbiology '' , and considered to be the first microbiologist .
