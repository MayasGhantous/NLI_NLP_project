  then there 's a whole lot of painters , as well . 
  turkey 's accession should be an absolute no-go at this point . 
  as long as that maniac is in charge , they have no place being in the eu . 
  i 'm surprised nato is n't more eager to get rid of them . 
  united arab emirates 2 . 
  the netherlands 3 . 
  china not the top 3 i was expecting , to be honest . 
  to the surprise of absolutely nobody . 
  on your way now , kid . 
  piss off , kid . 
  go try and impress people elsewhere . 
   asked if re-introducing the death penalty was an option for dealing with coup-plotters , yildirim said the turkish government will consider legal changes . 
   the turkish pm said the death penalty is not in the constitution but legal changes will be considered .

  i sure hope not . 
   lol why is this posted in / r/europe because it 's relevant . 
  and because european redditors are very concerned about the developments in turkey , because of its possible implications for the future of the turkish people , its possible implications for europe as a whole , and because many of us have friends in turkey . 
   this shitty asian country has nothing to do with europe or anything the european civilization represents oh my , how edgy you are . 
  repeating the same tired old shit again and again as per usual . 
  keep singing that same old tune , let those tears flow and form a mighty river . 
  do we really have to have this retarded discussion every time ? 
  come on , dude . 
   you have to show respect to the king , just like you have to show respect to anyone . 
  i think we should all respect each other , however i do n't think not respecting someone should be a crime . 
  referendums are all the rage these days . 
   i agree with you completely by the way , and even the king mentioned he thought the law was outdated by now i believe ? 
  yeah , even he feels arresting people for insulting him is going too far . 
  this is n't the king 's doing , it 's the om 's doing . 
  i may be a republican ( in the sense that i favour getting rid of the monarchy and becoming a republic , not in the sense of being a member of the american political party of the same name ) , but i have no problems with the king as a person , he seems like a pretty good guy . 
  i 've always been for it . 
  sadly , it is n't entirely up to me . 
  generally speaking most people are against the enforcement of this law , in my experience , but whether or not people will actually get outraged about these instances sort of depends on the nature of the incident . 
  this particular guy is an absolute dick , so people are n't quite as upset about his arrest and sentencing . 
  i 'm a journalist in the hague , i can assure you i 've done a lot more than just that when it comes to this subject . 
  i know , that 's why i said the law should be abolished . 
  i can not believe they actually went through with this . 
  utterly pathetic . 
  i 've always been in favour of getting rid of the monarchy , but if we 're going back to the `` jail the peasants who dare insult the monarch '' days i might be in trouble , given my record . 
  abolish that dumb fucking law already . 
  at least he is n't actually going to jail , but the probation is bad enough , and nobody should be prosecuted for `` l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 '' in the first place . 
  and fuck the king . 
   tulips fair enough . 
  russia can into `` the detrimental decadence of the west '' . 
  she 'd be a fool to think appointing boris as foreign secretary would not make the world snicker and question her competence . 
  i was really referring to the fact that , typically , non-elected pms try to avoid making controversial moves , and just sort of ride out the term of the person they 've replaced without making too much noise . 
  i greeted it with laughter . 
  hysterical , ceaseless laughter . 
  pm who was n't elected appoints international joke to foreign secretary position . 
  it 's beautiful . 
  ouch , that is embarrassing . 
  in newspaper headlines , the government of a country is typically referred to by the name of that country , unless the subject of the article is something going on within that government . 
  it 's like in sports , you do n't say `` the football team of france will be playing the football team of portugal in the final '' , you say `` france will be playing portugal '' . 
  in headlines you do a similar thing with governments , taking them as representatives of the countries they govern . 
  the headline is never `` the government of the netherlands has introduced a new law '' , it 's always `` the netherlands introduces new law '' . 
  come on , people . 
  germany is a country ( and a republic , which is the opposite of a kingdom ) , the kingdom of the netherlands is not a country , it 's a kingdom comprising four different countries . 
  however , the netherlands is a country , and it 's one of the four countries in that kingdom . 
  another one of the four countries in that kingdom is sint maarten . 
  these are two different countries , and they 're two of the four different countries found within the kingdom of the netherlands , which is neither a country nor a republic . 
  each of these four countries has borders . 
  although two of them only have coasts , really . 
  it could n't possibly be further from being `` exactly the same '' . 
  if you honestly think you can compare the bundesl\u00e4nder of germany with the four countries of the kingdom of the netherlands ( one of those four countries is the country of the netherlands , another one of those four countries is the country of sint maarten ) , then there 's no point to this argument . 
  i 'll make this as simple as i can : the title of this post is `` how many direct borders every european country has . '', 
  the title of this post is * not * `` how many direct borders every european country has , except in the case of the netherlands , where we did n't take the number of borders the european country has , but instead took the number of border of the various european and non-european countries within the kingdom that that european country is a part of . '', 
   we also do n't count the borders of bavaria or nrw separately , eventhough they 're separate states within a country . 
  that 's because that is entirely different . 
  bundesl\u00e4nder are the german equivalent to our provinces , not to other countries . 
  the border between gelderland and drenthe is not included in op 's map , just like the borders of bavaria or nrw are not . 
  aruba , sint maarten , and cura\u00e7ao are not states within the country of the netherlands . 
  they 're * countries * , that are all a part of the kingdom of the netherlands , and the netherlands is the fourth country in that kingdom . 
  these countries have borders . 
  the netherlands is a country that has two borders . 
  one with germany to the east , and one with belgium to the south . 
  the netherlands is a constituent country of the kingdom of the netherlands . 
  cura\u00e7ao is also a constituent country of the kingdom of the netherlands . 
  then there 's aruba , another constituent country of the kingdom of the netherlands . 
  and finally , the fourth constituent country of the kingdom of the netherlands , sint maarten . 
  the borders of the country of sint maarten are not the borders of the country of the netherlands , just like the borders of the country of aruba are not the borders of the country of cura\u00e7ao . 
  right . 
  it 's a country within the kingdom of the netherlands . 
  there are 4 countries within the kingdom of the netherlands . 
  sint maarten is one of these countries , the netherlands is another one of these countries . 
  the four countries are : the netherlands aruba cura\u00e7ao sint maarten the point is that the netherlands ( the country ) is a country within the kingdom of the netherlands , and that sint maarten ( the country ) is another country within the kingdom of the netherlands . 
  sint maarten 's borders are the borders of the country of sint maarten , not the borders of the country of the netherlands . 
  and it 's the number of borders of the country , not the kingdom , that the post refers to . 
  both countries are part of the same kingdom , but they 're two separate countries . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_netherlands  the kingdom of the netherlands is a sovereign state and constitutional monarchy with territory in western europe and in the caribbean . 
   the four parts of the kingdom -- the netherlands , aruba , cura\u00e7ao , and sint maarten -- are constituent countries ( landen in dutch ) and participate on a basis of equality as partners in the kingdom . 
  they 're four separate countries , not one country . 
  sint maarten 's border with france is not a border of the country of the netherlands . 
  she 's the one who is massively devoted to the eradication of uk citizens ' privacy , right ? 
  it 's a country within the kingdom of the netherlands , yes . 
  as are aruba , and cura\u00e7ao . 
  but it 's not a part of the * country * of the netherlands .
