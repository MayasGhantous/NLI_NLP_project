  '' , it 's an attempt to change the subject and shift the focus onto a different group of people than the people the discussion is about . 
  it 's called `` derailing a discussion '' . 
  it 's when , rather than engage the subject of the discussion , you try to change the subject to something else instead , thereby defeating the purpose of the discussion . 
  if this were one of the threads about muslim schools engaging in similar sort of things and someone went `` yeah , well the christians do it too so i 'm not gon na get mad about this '' , it would be equally retarded . 
  do n't much care for berets , whatever nonsense that 's supposed to be a reference to , but i do appreciate people sticking to the subject of a thread , rather than immediately trying to change the subject into something else . 
  it sort of defeats the purpose . 
  as soon as i read the title my first thought was `` i wonder how long it will take before the people in the thread will be trying to change the subject to muslims '' . 
  you never fail , r/europe . 
  religious schools are a terrible idea . 
  schools are for learning . 
  you ca n't call it a science lesson if they 're teaching religious doctrine instead of science . 
  hate speech laws are a complete infringement on freedom of speech . 
  directly inciting violence is another matter , though . 
  as the article puts it :  a total of 625 arrests were made for alleged section 127 offences in 2010 -- a number which had ballooned to 857 by 2015 . 
   during the years 2010-2015 2,130 people were arrested between 2010 and 2015 for `` sending by public communication network an offensive / indecent / obscene / menacing message / matter '' -- which is a criminal offence under section 127 . 
   although arrests for the alleged offences were slowly declining until 2013 , they peaked again in 2015 . 
  included in the 857 section 127 arrests made last year were 139 cuffings for sending , or causing to be sent , `` a false message to cause annoyance , inconvenience or anxiety '' -- a 71 per cent increase over the number of arrests made for the same alleged offences in 2011 . 
  there is a difference between `` standing on a street corner telling a mob to attack a mosque '' and `` using public communication networks ( facebook/twitter ) to send offensive/indecent/obscene messages '' or `` using public communication networks ( facebook/twitter ) to send , or cause to be sent , a message that causes annoyance , inconvenience , or anxiety '' . 
  one is to stand in the street and directly encourage an angry mob to attack a target , the other is to tweet something offensive or something that caused annoyance or anxiety . 
  one of those two could rationally be considered criminal . 
  surely the city 's valuable resources could be used for a better purpose than arresting people for hurting other people 's feelings ? 
  since when is gloating a crime ? 
  i 'm really pulling for [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjsnymi4z0u ) . 
  it 's horrendous . 
  i ca n't get enough of it . 
  would you like to take a shot at attacking the other source as well ? 
  i know the old `` if you do n't like the substance , attack the source '' is popular in certain circles , but that does n't mean you should half-ass it . 
  surely you can come up with something for the atlantic as well . 
   itt people did n't go past the title you 're surprised by this ? 
  you must be new to reddit . 
  the kremlin does love its trolls . 
  http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/the-kremlins-troll-army/375932/ http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/putin-kremlin-inside-russian-troll-house, 
  what an incredibly dumb thing to say . 
   turkey 's foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu blasted the `` irresponsible '' move by german parliamentarians and accused germany of seeking to distract from its own dark history of the third reich . 
  no , you moron , germany fully acknowledges its own dark history , you 're the ones who throw a fit any time anyone acknowledges yours , when it comes to this particular genocide . 
  there 's nothing particularly bad about our monarchy compared to others , and i have nothing against the king as a person . 
  personally , i oppose the concept of a monarchy altogether , so it 's a matter of principle . 
  the fact that a lot of the members of our monarchy throughout the years have been a bit embarrassing and have engaged in some questionable activities is an added extra . 
  that 's weird , i 've never heard any member of our government refer to it as anything other than `` the armenian question '' or `` the armenian situation '' . 
  apparently there was a motion put forth in parliament in 2004 that `` asks the government within the framework of its dialogue with turkey to continuously and expressly raise the recognition of the armenian genocide '' . 
  i 'm jealous of you , but at the same time happy for you . 
  it 's just some water on the wheels . 
  the amount of `` damage '' taken by those bikes in the picture is taken by mine regularly , and has been , for decades . 
  bicycle rims are made either of stainless steel or aluminium , and at worst you 'll get a bit of water splashing on the chain , which happens to every bike in the country on every rainy day anyway ( and we have a lot of rainy days ) . 
  you oil that shit up once every couple of weeks and you 're perfectly , totally , completely fine . 
   if you do n't dry it off afterwards and make sure everything is properly oiled this will significantly reduce the life time of the bike . 
  words you 'll never hear a dutch person say . 
  using the bike intensively on a daily basis will put an end to the life of the bike long before rust will get a chance to . 
  in some of the horseshit narratives various parts of reddit and other message boards in the internet like to circlejerk about , perhaps , but this is a photograph , from * reality * . 
  things are a little bit different there , compared to the internet-created `` reality '' . 
  i 'm trying to find the mistreatment of bikes in the picture , but i do n't see what you 're referring to . 
  it 's just people riding bikes around . 
  [ we 've got mary mapes dodge to thank for everything always bringing that up as if it 's a dutch thing . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans_brinker,_or_the_silver_skates ), 
  good news . 
  well done , germany , you did the right thing . 
  no , i actually made the exact same joke in this very thread , [ before / u/gagatron did ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4lvprf/jon_snow_condemns_abusive_and_boring_eu/d3qkouo ) . 
  nothing went over my head . 
  i was just wondering in what way the title was clickbait . 
  i think he/she might be under the impression that the jon snow from the headline refers to the character , rather than the newsreader , so i clarified who it was really in reference to , in case that was in fact the case . 
  jon snow was born in 1947 , he had the name jon snow long before george r. r. martin wrote * a song of ice and fire * . 
  just because that book series has recently been turned into a tv show that has become very popular , does n't mean that any reference to jon snow , the longest-running newscaster on british television , is therefore clickbait . 
  yeah , but he knows nothing . 
  how is it clickbait ? 
  it 's one thing for * you * to refuse to acknowledge the armenian genocide , but trying to pressure others into joining in is a bit much , erdogan . 
  that 's a bit rich . 
  hahaha . 
  good luck with that one . 
  it will be yet another addition to the long lists of `` things you 're technically not allowed to do on a bicycle but everyone does anyway , and which the police are either not or barely going to enforce '' . 
  you could take a look at krakow , in poland . 
  it 's popular among skateboarders . 
  i know it 's not their official anthem . 
  all i said was it 's one of my favourite anthems . 
  i remember watching amy macdonald [ sing it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vkyicdn834 ) with the whole scottish crowd joining in , just beautiful . 
  it 's a pretty poor anthem . 
  i 'd be in favour of changing it , but apparently i 'm in a minority . 
  my personal favourite anthems are * la marseillaise * and * flower of scotland * . 
  and they also should n't have such laws . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
   white people always need someone to hate i guess . 
  fucking white people , am i right ? 
  god , they are just awful . 
  you sound like a lovely guy . 
  it 's perfectly possible to care greatly about both . 
  in his defence , i doubt erdogan has much experience in caring even a little bit about the rights of gay people or animals , so he probably is n't aware of that . 
   ** the president of turkey has said democracy and freedom have `` absolutely no value '' in the country ** after calling for journalists , lawyers and politicians to be prosecuted as terrorists . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/president-erdogan-says-freedom-and-democracy-have-no-value-in-turkey-amid-arrests-and-military-a6938266.html  but after his islamist views landed him in prison in 1999 , and his welfare party was banned , he founded the justice and development party ( akp ) , returning to office once a temporary ban was lifted in 2003 . 
   ** `` democracy is like a train , '' he said at the time . 
  `` we shall get out when we arrive at the station we want . 
  '' ** http://www.channel4.com/news/erdogan-turkey-islamic-sultan-protest, 
  you 're taking this far more seriously than i thought anyone possibly would . 
  well done . 
  but we do n't need them . 
  nobody needs them . 
  we do n't need any messages on public buses . 
  i would have assumed it was photoshopped if it were n't for the fact that i 've crossed that border many times , and it really is like that . 
  i do n't think anyone here is even aware of it , have n't seen any flags or anything like that . 
  could you please keep your religious messages off public facilities ? 
  breivik is the sort of guy who will knowingly get himself right back in there . 
  like , he 'll have a chance of getting out after 21 years , but then he 'll do a nazi salute in the courtroom and go on some insane rant about the resurrection of christendom , and he 'll be right back in prison .
