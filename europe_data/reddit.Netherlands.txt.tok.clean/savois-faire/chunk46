   `` all three men have a common background in the nordic resistance movement and got to know each other through that organization , '' gothenburg district court said in its verdict . 
   the neo-nazi nordic resistance movement is known as one of the most violent far-right groups in sweden . 
  in a 2009 report , swedish security police said the organization 's goal was to establish a totalitarian government through revolution . 
  good riddance . 
  we call them eco-aquaducts ; a combination of an ecoduct and an aquaduct . 
  an absolutely despicable cunt . 
   he called that nazi practices . 
  of course he did . 
   and the logo at the end indicates he is using the video as a campaign video for his reelection to congress . 
  this is disgusting beyond description . 
  he should look up what ` nazi ' means , given how much he likes to call people nazis . 
  shameful . 
  some warnings are stronger than others . 
   the judges on the case added that the instructor should also have checked the teenager 's id that she was over the age of 18 . 
   it was also alleged that bungee jumping from the road bridge is banned under spanish regulation . 
  i feel like he 's more likely to get in trouble for that than he is for the fact that she misheard him and did n't doublecheck . 
  about 50,000 people live there . 
  it 's the least densely populated country in the world , i think . 
  so , he 's saying that when you have more than two black guys on a basketball team , the team starts to struggle and perform badly ? 
  that must be why all the teams in the nba are almost exclusively white ... 
  in case the sheep acts up ? 
  why even have a chinstrap , if you 're going to do it like that ? 
  i like those vambraces though . 
  he 's truly dedicated . 
  we went with tsjechi\u00eb . 
  we 're sort of conflating the `` sinterklaas '' character with the actual saint nicholas . 
  the real saint nicholas , patron saint of children on whom the sinterklaas character is based , was a greek bishop who lived in myra , in what is now south-western turkey . 
  on the 5 ^ th of december ( or 6 ^ th of december in belgium , i believe ) he is celebrated with a holiday for children , because he was the patron saint of children . 
  this holiday has been celebrated for a very long time , but the `` sinterklaas '' character and the surrounding lore did n't come until later . 
  in 1850 , dutch children 's book author jan schenkman wrote a book called * sint nikolaas en zijn knecht * ( saint nicholas and his . . uhh . . assistant ? 
  `` knecht '' can be translated a few different ways ) , which featured a character based on saint nicholas and included a lot of things already associated with the holiday , but also a bunch of things not originally a part of the saint nicholas story . 
  these ended up becoming part of the holiday . 
  among these are the steamboat and the `` zwarte piet '' character ( which is based on the `` knecht '' from the book ) . 
  before this , the holiday was about the actual saint nicholas , and children were told that every year saint nicholas comes and gives the children gifts while they sleep ( these gifts were of course secretly left behind by their parents , as is still the case ) . 
  oranges were a common gift ( we 're talking 17 ^ th and 18 ^ th century , here ) , and most oranges in the netherlands were imported from spain , and so the notion that he came from or via spain was born . 
  jan schenkman , the children 's book author who wrote the story that the modern sinterklaas character is based on , also wrote a song and put it in the book . 
  it included a line about saint nicholas coming on a steamboat from spain , which further cemented the backstory of the modern sinterklaas character as coming from spain . 
  the steamboat was an addition schenkman came up with on his own . 
  the tabloid press in general are a pretty sleazy bunch , but in britain they really turn it up a notch . 
  was n't he greek ? 
  i think he just lived in turkey . 
  feel free to delude yourself all you like , but as parents you have a duty to do what you can to keep your child healthy . 
  deliberately not allowing a baby to get proper nutrition is sickening . 
   despite the baby gasping for air in the days leading to his death , the court heard that his parents never thought to seek medical attention . 
  an autopsy showed he was dehydrated and his stomach was completely empty . 
   `` not a single doctor had a dossier about lucas and child protection services did not know about them . ''  `` the parents determined their own diagnosis that their child was gluten intolerant and had a lactose allergy . 
   they also blamed the parents for driving to a homoeopathic doctor on the other side of the country when the baby was starving instead of going to the nearest hospital . 
  i despise these two individuals . 
  is that a shield with a lobster on it ? 
  while providing an example of one that does . 
   wait till she wins then i 'm gon na ask you again xd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lukymyp2noo, 
  it 's a risk we just ca n't take . 
  i think that 's what people usually mean when they say `` nazi '' , these days . 
  no one is accusing fn members of being members of the nsdap . 
  even marine 's dad was only about 10 when the war started , it would n't be a very realistic accusation . 
  apparently i linked to his `` pictaram '' instead ( never even heard of that ) . 
  i recognised the signature in op 's photo , thought `` oh , i checked out that guy 's instagram a while back , it was full of cool stuff , i 'll share it '' . 
  then i googled `` proboynick instagram '' , and copied the first link . 
  it 's literally the exact same page , but with a different logo at the top . 
  what 's the point of that ? 
  apparently pictaram is an `` online instagram posts viewer '' ... is n't that just what instagram is ? 
  it 's the same page , with the same pictures ... 
   you got to love propaganda ... 
  he certainly does . 
  a frenchman ?!, 
  joking aside , he was actually a pretty good king , at least as far as his intentions are concerned . 
  and he did come before william i , but he was appointed to the position of `` king of holland '' in the newly named `` kingdom of holland '' by napoleon ( i doubt napoleon put too much thought into that name , he just wanted to put an end to the batavian republic because he felt it was getting too independent , so he made his brother `` king '' ; napoleon himself said louis would be king in name only , and that he really just wanted him be a sort of vassal of his , although louis had other plans and did actually try to be a real king ) . 
  william i was the first to hold the title of king of the netherlands . 
  william the silent was never the monarch , he died long before we had a monarchy . 
  i suggest [ william i of the netherlands ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/william_i_of_the_netherlands.jpg/800px-william_i_of_the_netherlands.jpg ) , the first king and sovereign . 
   the map does n't only show monarchs of present day european countries , it shows monarchs that are significant in a country 's history and/or are considered great national heroes/figures . 
  william the silent was very significant in our history , and he is certainly something of a national hero , but he was never our monarch . 
  that 's nikita golubev . 
  he makes some great stuff .

  what a time to be alive . 
  [ removed ], 
   keep in mind , i 've never ever heard of any attempt to use this symbol after these times , and i do n't think that it 's really extremely inflamatory as , say , nazi germany 's flag would be personally , i think of the nvu 's logo as the modern equivalent . 
  i actually did not know this . 
  there are not . 
  d\u00f6ner is my weakness . 
  there 's a place in tokyo called kagurazaka hanten , that has a `` mega gyoza challenge '' . 
  i did n't dare taking on the challenge myself , once i saw how big it was , but if you can finish it you get it for free . 
   `` ahh holland , very nice , lots of smokey smokey and women heh hahahahaa '' http://i.imgur.com/du2il1l.gif, 
  telling americans you 're from the netherlands can be entertaining . 
  you get a lot of `` is that near holland ? '', 
  and `` that 's the capital of amsterdam , right ? '' . 
  that sort of thing . 
  it 's not just americans , to be fair . 
  lots of people from outside of europe say things like that . 
  telling americans you 're from the netherlands can be entertaining . 
  you get a lot of `` is that near holland ? '', 
  and `` that 's the capital of amsterdam , right ? '' . 
  the weirdest one was this guy who told me `` i love your croissants ! '' . 
  i eventually worked out what he was talking about , he thought i was danish and he was talking about those danish pastries . 
  why is alcohol so expensive in norway ? 
  i went to norway a few years ago , and i was amazed at how much it cost to get a few beers . 
  the manchester united hooligans who all had london accents ? 
  they were great . 
  hehe .
