   i would not think twice before threatening you with rape . . well , i appreciate the honesty :p that has always baffled me as well , how people will say the vilest things with their real names and place of employment etc. 
  visible for all to see . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erftk9qg4j4 ) is the dutch at their finest . 
  never read the comments . 
  it 's doable on reddit , for the most part , but in the comment sections on news sites or on social media everyone displays their very worst aspects for the world to see . 
  working , unfortunately . 
  the last thing russia needs right now is for its government to start massively investing in military expansion . 
  and yet , that is what their government is doing . 
  love it . 
  not that creamy stuff though , the thick stuff ( especially with little chunks of nuts in them ) . 
  you ca n't go wrong with the [ classic ] ( http://www.appiehein.com/2650-2464-thickbox/pindakaas-calve.jpg ) , of course . 
  guaranteed quality , plenty of vitamin e , delicious . 
  speaking as a journalist , the current turkish government is an absolute disgrace . 
  you 've quoted some parts of the comment i wrote . . well done , i guess . 
  as you can see if you look at my actual comment , i took a quote from the posted article , commented on said quote with some remarks regarding the mentality the american authorities tend to take towards people like snowden , then linked to a different article with further illustration of the point i made in my commentary on the quote from op 's article , and followed it with an interesting and relevant quote from that article about the mentality the american authorities are taking in regards to snowden . 
  it 's fairly standard and common practice . 
  what i did not write was this : '' the heads of the pentagon and the nsa want to kill him with their own hands :  ` in a world where i would not be restricted from killing an american , i personally would go and kill him myself , ' a current nsa analyst told buzzfeed . 
  ' a lot of people share this sentiment . ', 
   ' i would love to put a bullet in his head , ' one pentagon official , a former special forces officer , said bluntly ... https://pando.com/2014/01/16/pentagon-nsa-officials-say-they-want-snowden-extrajudicially-assassinated/ '' the fact that that is what you read into it regardless , i can not help . 
  i never claimed that either quote was from the head of either organisation , i just linked to an article and quoted a passage that was interesting and relevant to the point i was making about the american authorities and their tendencies and attitudes when it comes to this sort of thing . 
  and , speaking as a journalist , just because a statement is given to buzzfeed rather than a different source does n't change anything about the statement itself . 
  feel free to take a look at the sources , rather than just saying you question them , read the article , take a look at the author to see if you can find any biases you suspect just from seeing the word ` buzzfeed ' , and make up your own mind . 
  mongolia had a female president in the 1950s . 
  europe 's first was [ vigd\u00eds finnbogad\u00f3ttir ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vigd%c3%ads_finnbogad%c3%b3ttir ) . 
   what is troubling to me is the suggestion that if mr. snowden showed up in one of these countries , he should be promptly extradited -- before he would have a chance to raise his humanitarian rights under international law , he says . 
  yeah , the americans do n't have the greatest of records when it comes to respecting human rights , especially for those it considers criminals . 
  the heads of the pentagon and the nsa want him killed , in fact preferably they want to do it themselves .

  in fairness , they did make [ great ads ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiutgtzwhac ) . 
  well , that 's that infamous dutch frugality . 
  what 's up with sweden and hand-grenades ? 
  very well done . 
  drink a lot , then drink some more . 
   we drink beer , not piss and then putting the label `` heineken '' on it like some country . 
  trust me , the vast majority of dutch people i know do not drink heineken , unless it 's the only beer available ( which , thanks to heineken , is the case in quite a lot of caf\u00e9s , bars , and restaurants ) . 
  most people where i live prefer , when it comes to dutch beer , things like hertog jan or brand . 
   the antifa and far left are the worst . 
  the far-anything are the worst . 
  extremism poisons everything . 
  there is a stereotype that dutch people are incredibly progressive/liberal/tolerant . 
  the truth is that dutch people are a bit apathetic and have a `` do what you like , if you leave me alone i 'll leave you alone '' type of attitude . 
  there is a stereotype that dutch people are frugal as fuck . 
  the truth is that dutch people are frugal as fuck . 
  the security was always present , whenever she was in school . 
  but of course , you knew that that was what i meant already . . 
  the one she attended when she was younger is an `` openbare school '' , which translates to `` public school '' but is what you guys would refer to as a `` state school '' ( in the netherlands , the only real difference i believe is that state schools are not allowed to discriminate in who they accept ) . 
  i 'm not entirely sure but i believe the school she will be attending starting this year is not a state school but what we would call a `` private school '' . 
  i 'm still a little confused as to the difference between what the british call `` public schools '' and what the british call `` private schools '' , but [ this ] ( https://www.justlanded.com/english/netherlands/netherlands-guide/education/state-versus-private ) is a pretty good overview of how it works in the netherlands . 
  i know , i was just joking because of the way the title is written . 
  west germany has the other half , then ? 
  seems like an equal balance . . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure how it will be at her new school , but at the school she went to when she was little ( which her younger sister still attends ) there was 24/7 security on each corner of the schoolyard whenever she was in school , which there still is for her sister . 
  i imagine it will be similar at her new school . 
  the netherlands : * de marathon * . 
  that stereotype comes from our policy of tolerance regarding marijuana-use , and the fact that you can just buy weed at coffeeshops without any trouble . 
  we do n't actually smoke that much weed , compared to other western countries we smoke less ( per capita ) than most . 
  the americans , for example , smoke weed at a rate almost twice as high as ours ( per capita ) . 
  yes , the dutch are indeed quite frugal in my experience . 
  i consider it a positive . 
  and we can come across a bit rude , i suppose . 
   you can still support freedom of speech and at the same time disagree with the contents . 
  that is pretty much exactly what i said . 
  i said i disagree with islamophobia , but support the freedom of speech of those who are islamophobic , because i support freedom of speech . 
  if you do n't support freedom of speech for people/speech you do n't like , you do n't support freedom of speech . 
  personally , i find islamophobia vile , but i still support the islamophobe 's freedom of speech . 
  obligatory plug : / r/lovecraft . 
  john leguizamo as luigi ? 
  that is awesome . 
  lovely people . 
   in swiss ? 
  holy shit . 
  what is that ? 
  if it were n't for the shirt i would have certainly assumed that guy was dutch . 
  ah , the element of surprise . 
  it can be a real pain in the arse . 
  sorry , last * time * . 
  my mistake . 
  the empire strikes back !, 
  i was there last year , it 's absolute madness . 
  beautiful stuff . 
  it sort of ebbs and flows . 
  but yes , there is no shortage of racists on this sub . 
   you are 40.0 % european , and you scored closest to netherlands , with a similarity of 55.4 % !, 
  i guess that 's good ? 
  i 'm still fairly certain i 'm 100 % european . 
  that 's not bad for gt . 
  it 's `` when flies fly , flies fly after flies '' . 
  ` after ' in this case means ` in pursuit of ' , as in `` i 'm going after him '' meaning `` i 'm going to chase/follow him '' . 
  it does n't really mean anything , it 's just a repetition of the word `` vliegen '' that happens to still make a functioning sentence . 
  ` vliegen ' is both the plural form of the noun ` vlieg ' ( a fly ) and the verb meaning ` to fly ' . 
  so fucking good . 
  erdogan can fuck right off . 
  those eyes though . . like fucking crystals . 
  however , fuck that guy . 
  i 'm guessing it was reported by people who want that to happen . 
  it 's certainly the first i 've heard of it . 
  i have to fully concur with the user 's closing statement that `` on any dutch website the comment section would consist entirely of swearing '' , as well . 
  smeaton 's preferred method is to kick terrorists in the balls , though .
