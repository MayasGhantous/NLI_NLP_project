   the crimea has always been russian in the minds of russians , yes . 
  in reality , crimea is a part of ukraine . 
  look at [ this picture of crimea ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ukraine-crimea-map1.gif ) , notice how crimea is a part of the landmass that is ukraine , and not in any way part of the land that is russia . 
  the land that is crimea is a part of the country called ukraine , a country whose sovereignty your president swore to never infringe upon . 
  turns out that was a lie . 
  any religious influence in politics is undesirable . 
  religion should be a relationship between you and your god , it should be kept as far out of politics as possible . 
  [ it 's the italian justice system , and it 's silvio berlusconi . . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/54p825x.gif ), 
  these two would make a great odd couple sitcom . 
   it 's called preemptive strike .

  `` what you are not told by the media , as told by the media . . '', 
  in case anyone is wondering , it 's neuschwanstein . 
  if there 's one thing i 've learned from being a journalist ( read : from dealing with editors ) , it is to never trust a headline . 
  especially with all the clickbait going around nowadays . 
  that moment in the peadogeddon episode where the guy is `` disguised as a school '' still floors me every time . 
  god bless the ypg/ypj , and the peshmerga .

  we 've always been an ambitious people . 
  i see no reason why we ca n't do both .

  we 've had it for 14 years now . 
  the institute of marriage has n't crumbled , god 's wrath has not been visited upon us , society has n't fallen apart , nobody has married any children or animals . . 
  it would be great if they just came out and said `` look , we just do n't like gay people '' , but they know that 's not a valid argument and that they would n't be listened to at all if they were honest . 
  for dutch people the same problem . 
  any context ? 
  he looks more and more like [ jimmy page ] ( https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/spl758614_007_93378365-e1400476629117.jpg ) every time i see him . 
  it 's frustrating , on the one hand i 'm 100 % in favour of freedom of expression , including the freedom to offend people 's religious sensitivities , but on the other hand geert wilders is a cunt of the highest order . 
   head of the danish people 's party kristian thulesen dahl sings the song : '' you 'll never walk alone '' during his party 's celebrations thursday evening . 
  it 's not a proper celebration until there 's karaoke involved . 
  who does n't love norwegians ? 
  to have a centre for male rape victims is `` extremely politically correct '' ? 
  helping rape-victims is simply `` correct '' , and little has been done for male victims of rape , of which there are tons , so i applaud it . 
  you 're telling me people on reddit made an enormous exaggeration about political correctness and feminism to try to present a false reality they can use to justify certain claims or affirm certain statements ? 
  well , i never . . 
  i know a guy who the same thing happened to , and he 's still friends with the girl who did it . 
  he was a little annoyed and told her to fuck off and whatnot , but he does n't consider it to be rape . 
  it 's a weird thing , he had a sexual act performed on him against his will , so it 's a sexual assault i would say , but he was n't penetrated so it is n't considered rape by most . 
  it 's a weird thing . 
  your mind is in a dark place . 
  it needs a revolution , a glorious revolution . 
  i 'm feeling a little fucking left out here . . 
  if you 're interested in the sort of thing , there 's a pretty good documentary about the founding of the pirate bay and the whole 2008 court case affair , called [ tpb afk : the pirate bay away from keyboard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etokxcewo_8 ) . 
  i used it to mean `` to create some more discussion about that subject '' . 
  i was just giving / u/t0t0zenerd an honest answer to his legitimate question . 
  african migrants is all this sub ever seems to talk about these days . . 
  i 'm guessing this is posted to rouse more such discussion . 
   the british royal family joined commemorations monday to mark the 800th anniversary of magna carta , a document that has come to symbolize democracy and equal rights under law meanwhile , the british government is seeking to scrap the human rights act and pretty much abolish the right to privacy . .

   the probe tweeted the message , `` hello earth !,

  ah , i loved that show so much . 
  may you remain forever independent , and may the same go for the countries around you , and the rest of us . 
  he had n't typed his destination in properly , that 's more the fault of the driver than the gps . 
  also , it takes a significant lack of planning , as a driver , to end up in a situation where you think you 're in wales when you 're in yorkshire . 
  there 's border-crossings , even a toll you have to pay to get into wales , is n't there ? 
   it emerged in recent months that the equivalent of around an eighth of annual gdp had gone missing from the three banks . 
  yeah , there 's probably something fishy going on there . . 
  does scotland still have the unicorn as its national animal ? 
  because that is just awesome . 
  he certainly changed his tune from his '90s proclamation that `` ukraine is a state whose sovereignty we will never infringe on '' . 
  insane that they ca n't even pass a piece of legislation to do something about it . 
  seriously , if your partner ( male or female ) is physically abusing you , they 're a piece of shit and you should leave them . 
  the more i hear about these nazi fellows , the more i 'm starting to feel like they were some pretty awful characters . 
  good news . 
  thanks . 
  could you explain which party is which in that graph ? 
  i 'm hoping for a great day for the chp . 
  i think his point is that you described slavery on a massive scale combined with deliberately and knowingly letting tons of people die from the conditions they 're working under as `` whatever human rights things '' . 
  it 's actually a pretty big and awful deal and to many people a legitimate reason to take away a world cup . 
  if only for the sheer amount of unbelievably great poets you get to boast , i 'd love to be irish . 
  my personal favourite yeats is * an irish airman foresees his death * : `` i know that i shall meet my fate somewhere among the clouds above ; those that i fight i do not hate those that i guard i do not love ; my country is kiltartan cross , my countrymen kiltartan 's poor , no likely end could bring them loss or leave them happier than before . 
  nor law , nor duty bade me fight , nor public man , nor cheering crowds , a lonely impulse of delight drove to this tumult in the clouds ; i balanced all , brought all to mind , the years to come seemed waste of breath , a waste of breath the years behind in balance with this life , this death . '', 
  whichever would put him away the longest , i would support . 
  i hope the americans lock that piece of shit up for a long , long time . 
  as soon as i read the title the first thought that came to mind was `` that 'll be about baarle-nassau/baarle-hartog '' . 
  i 've been there , and it really is a weird place . 
  wonderful , but weird . 
   the doner itself is seitan , made by combining wheat gluten and water if that does n't make your mouth water . . no offense intended of course , i 'm sure it 's actually pretty good or they 'd go out of business , and they seem to be doing quite well .

  i ca n't get behind anyone who defends blatter . 
  i 'm not even * that * into football , i much prefer rugby , but fifa has become just a horrendous organisation , and it 's largely because of blatter . 
  as an omnivore , i say `` why not both '' ? 
  i hate to do this . . but i rather liked it . 
  as pointless as it is , you have to admit it 's an impressive sight . 
  i thought of the blacklist not so much as `` unjustified '' , more of `` a joke '' . 
  i really hope chp does well . 
  i do n't know how the akp manages to remain so popular . 
  is n't it a bit odd to have your president assign a former leader of another country as governor of your region ? 
  of the second biggest city in your country , no less ? 
  i 'm fine with it .
