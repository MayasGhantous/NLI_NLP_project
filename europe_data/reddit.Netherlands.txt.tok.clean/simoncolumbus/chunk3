  it 's getting warmer ; perfect time of the year to start !, 
  here 's a [ study ] ( http://www.greens-efa.eu/fileadmin/dam/documents/studies/costs_of_cars/the_true_costs_of_cars_en.pdf ) on that : across the eu , each car is subsidized with 1600 euros per year . 
  for amsterdam , i have to agree that it 's pretty expensive ( although that has various reasons , including housing policy and a huge tourism sector ) . 
  cities built for bikes should therefore have high density and low centralisation . 
  a lot of people here combine public transport and cycling on their commute , though , and that works quite well . 
  as always , psychological evidence refers to mean outcomes , not strict causality . 
  cycling is a lot of fun , too , though - you should try it ;-), 
  in almost all places , cars are actually subsidised by the state . 
  even with high gas taxes , building and maintaining roads , offsetting environmental impacts , as well as foregone economic and health benefits from cycling are hugely expensive . 
  whenever somebody asks me why i do n't like my hometown , that 's the example i give ... ( there 's one decent bike lane from siegen via weidenau to kreuztal , and another to kaan-marienborn ; they 're quite useable . 
  nothing of dutch quality , of course ) . 
  granted ( and i 'm aware of that , i study methodology ... ) . 
  i 'm not aware of any experimental studies that explore this link ( but happy to read any links thrown at me !, 
  ) , but thought it worthwhile pointing out that policymakers consider cycling a key ingredient to liveability-focused urban planning . 
  i understand that american infrastructure is engineered for reliance on cars ( here , 290km is a lot of distance - but there 's also a good train network , which would certainly be an option for parts , if not all , of the us ) . 
  but if you only need a car for leaving the city , does not require you to drive one locally ? 
  here ( and in parts of the us , too ) car-sharing services are becoming quite popular , which integrate pretty well with cycling . 
  university on a hill - only one place would be bad enough at urban planning to do that ;-) i 'll admit , it 's an awful place to cycle in , as far as german cities go . 
  officially [ germany 's third-worst large city to cycle in !, 
  ] ( http://www.adfc.de/fahrradklima-test/ergebnisse/adfc-fahrradklimatest-2012---die-ergebnisse ) hills and weather do play a part in that for sure , but it 's also a home-made problem . 
  the city ( and region ) is just so fully engineered for reliance on cars , it 's hard to overcome that . 
  still hope it will happen one day , though !, 
  ... because they choose to live in the suburbs . 
  or so . 
  no , i 'll admit : urban planning in the us over the last half a century or so has centered so profoundly on cars , it has made cycling challenging in many places . 
  but most americans live in cities , and many of those cities [ are making surprising progress in catering to cyclists ] ( http://bicycletimesmag.com/surprising-rise-minneapolis-top-bike-town/ ) . 
  could be my hometown ( not perhaps from siegen , are you ? ) . 
  have cycled there , although not to uni . 
  i know it may be counterintuitive given the media reports , but [ despite the deaths , cycling in london is getting safer ] ( http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24636-despite-the-deaths-cycling-in-london-is-getting-safer.html ) . 
  similar trends seem to hold in other parts of the country that have seen an increase in cycling in recent years . 
  decreasingly so in places where cycling is popular , and not to a degree that offsets the gains in health and well-being obtained from cycling . 
  in places where cycling is mainstream - the netherlands in particular - you 'll find two effects : * people have a preference for living closer to the city centre , and are willing to sacrifice e.g. 
  space . 
  * in the netherlands , many people combine cycling and public transport : cycle to the train station , go to wherever you need to be , and get on another bike for the last mile . 
  reducing commuting times is actually extremely reasonable , because scientific evidence has shown time and again that [ commuting ( by car , specifically ) makes us intensely unhappy ] ( http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/03/30/commuting/ ) - to a degree that is not offset by , say , living in a larger house closer to nature . 
  i 've commuted by bike in canada and germany , too ( and in germany , in one of the most car-centric cities in the country ) . 
  still works for me . 
  see the evidence i posted - it 's scientific consensus that the overall health effects of cycling are positive . 
  in all places where cycling is even close to mainstream , cyclists are n't the stereotypical ` middle-aged men in lycra ' , but regular people in regular clothes . 
  i doubt you 'll find many dutch cyclists sweating at any time during their rides . 
  happiness / well-being [ ( sood , 2012 ) ] ( http://www.bbc.com/travel/blog/20120412-travelwise-what-copenhagen-can-teach-the-world ) :  copenhagen frequently tops rankings of the world 's happiest , most liveable and best-designed cities . 
  [ ... ] the importance of liveability in danish culture is exemplified in the sustainable infrastructure of its capital city . 
  copenhagen is friendly to pedestrians , and perhaps even friendlier to cyclists [ ... ] causing some to call copenhagen the number one cycling city in the world . 
  edit : here 's another great summary on [ why commuting by car makes us unhappy ] ( http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/03/30/commuting/ ) :  a few years ago , the swiss economists bruno frey and alois stutzer announced the discovery of a new human foible , which they called `` the commuters paradox '' . 
  they found that , when people are choosing where to live , they consistently underestimate the pain of a long commute . 
  this leads people to mistakenly believe that the big house in the exurbs will make them happier , even though it might force them to drive an additional hour to work . 
  another study , led by daniel kahneman and the economist alan krueger , surveyed nine hundred working women in texas and found that commuting was , by far , the least pleasurable part of their day . 
  health benefits [ ( oja et al. , 2011 ) ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2011.01299.x/abstract ) :  relatively large numbers and diverse types of cycling-specific studies [ show ] a positive relationship between cycling and health and functional benefits in young boys and girls and improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and disease risk factors as well as significant risk reduction for all-cause and cancer mortality and for cardiovascular , cancer , and obesity morbidity in middle-aged and elderly men and women . 
  [ t ] he existing state of knowledge reinforces the current public health efforts to promote cycling as an important contributor to improving population health . 
  environmental impact [ ( walker , 2011 ) ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/12/cycle-like-danes-cut-emissions ) :  europe could cut its transport greenhouse gas emissions by more than 25 % if every population cycled as regularly as the danes , according to a pioneering study which tracks the environmental impact of cycling down to the extra calories consumed by riders . 
  economic benefits [ ( schiller , 2013 ) ] ( http://www.fastcoexist.com/3021074/making-the-economic-case-for-cycling-friendly-cities-with-bikeonomics ) :  there 's also a potential `` green dividend '' when people bike about town , rather than driving to suburban malls . 
  their cash goes to local businesses , not to oil companies and middle eastern sheiks . 
  by driving 20 % less than other cities , portlanders contribute $ 800 million to the local economy , one study says . 
  [ ... ] bikeways also create more jobs per dollar than roads , according to one study . 
  edit : here 's another interesting study , showing that [ in the eu , on average each car is subsidised by society at large with 1600 euros per year ] ( http://www.greens-efa.eu/fileadmin/dam/documents/studies/costs_of_cars/the_true_costs_of_cars_en.pdf ) :  the cars used within the eu-27 externalize about 373 billion euros per year ( high estimate ) on to other people , other regions and other generations ( low estimate : 258 billion euros ) . 
  this is a considerable sum , and it leads to a level of car use that is ineffi cient from the perspective of society . 
  because `` others '' pay for large parts of the costs of transport , europeans travel by car too much to enable an efficient situation [ ... ] . 
  the findings of this study clearly show that the frequent claim `` that cars cover all their internal and external costs '' can not be sustained . 
  although no detailed estimation of charges and earmarked taxes of cars attributable to external costs has been made in this study , it is obvious that a sum in the range of 300 to 400 billion euros of earmarked funds against these costs can not be reached . 
  on the contrary ; it must be stated that car traffic in the eu is highly subsidized by other people and other regions ... n.b. 
  i used overview articles rather than individual studies , but all reference / link specific scientific evidence on the topic . 
  i need a car , like , once a year when i 'm going to ikea . 
  and every few years to move . 
  i 'd contend that most people who think they * need * a car do n't actually do much more . 
  as for size - i know enough people who commute between , say , amsterdam and utrecht or leiden without a car . 
  or cycle in london . 
  your loss . 
  cyclists are healthier , happier , and better for the environment * and * the economy  edit : before downvoting , please consider that i have [ sourced each of these statements ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20josp/paris_bans_half_of_all_cars_from_the_road_over/cg40f0o ) . 
  oh , absolutely . 
  how anybody would consider this as a long-term solution is beyond me . 
  there 's enough solutions out there ( in particular : london-style taxes , bans on particularly polluting vehicle types , increasing costs for parking , better cycling infrastructure , and better public transport ) - why settle for a crappy makeshift solution ? 
  ... or a bike . 
  seriously , are we that stuck in the car-centric mindset ? 
  that 's unlikely to occur in the short term , though ; and this appears to be an emergency decision rather than a long-term plan . 
  direct democracy ca n't be the only cause . 
  the svp is massively successful even compared to other new right parties in europe ( such as the dutch pvv , france 's fn , etc ) . 
  these election results definitely would support xenophobia being more mainstream in switzerland than elsewhere . 
  intellectually dishonest ? 
  yes . 
  among intelligent , often socially liberal believers - the type i 'd be most likely to meet , frankly - religious belief seems to be the one thing not questioned . 
  to me , that 's most important in the realm of science - i can not trust a religious scientist ; not because they are incapable , but because their belief indicates that they are willing to take a position without scientific evidence , and that there is something they are unwilling or incapable to challenge . 
  israel does that , too . 
  here 's [ one case documented by a un agency ] ( http://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/features/refusal-grant-travel-documents-traps-family-gaza-10-years ) ( admittedly rather complicated ) , and i 've seen others in similar situations . 
  israel frequently denies residents of gaza travel documents , including to relocate outside the country . 
  props for using ` banana ' as the first example . 
  it 's my favourite test word , too ... 
  was n't trying to imply that the communist world was culturally monolithic ; sorry if it sounded like that . 
  my thought was more along the lines that communism ca n't ( alone ) be blamed for the social conservativism we see in much of eastern europe today . 
  i 'm not sure you can just blame it on the soviets . 
  in germany , the gdr had more progressive laws towards homosexuals than the west . 
  it rather seems that while western europe continued to become more liberal , much of eastern europe has turned back towards religion and nationalism . 
  well , they are expected to continue ruling like this , so in effect they will establish equality in the near future . 
  just a pity it has to be fought before the courts because the conservatives would rather fight for laws they know are unconstitutional than do the right thing . 
  the trend in other countries is going in the opposite direction - languages are taught earlier at schools . 
  there are also developmental reasons for that : language acquisition changes around the age of twelve , and fluidity is much harder to achieve for people who only started learning later . 
  having had two foreign languages from first grade ( english and french , at a german steiner school ) , and now living in a country where students will regularly have learned three more foreign languages ( english , german , and french ; plus at times latin and greek ) , the uk system just appears extremely limiting . 
  would love to see more fine-grained data for this - i 'm pretty sure you would see much more variation between urban and rural areas across the eu than between countries . 
  well , the upside would be that dutch people would probably stop cursing their own ns . 
  it 's a bliss in comparison ... 
  as somebody regularly traveling from amsterdam to london , i 'd be in , if just to decrease travel times .
