  good point . 
  still find that the comparison to the iphone is n't too telling seeing that a comparable samsung phone outsells both , though . 
  kinda misleading title - jolla ( do they have only one product ) is still being outsold by four other phones , three of which are from samsung . 
  the article mostly seems to indicate that finns heavily prefer the galaxy line of phones over iphones . 
  and you ca n't even tell people who do n't read good not to reply ... 
  thanks for the link - makes the story look more like a piece of shitty reporting from the ap ( also , why does op link to voice of russia when the story comes from the ap ? 
  that 's unnecessary reliance on a less-than-trustworthy channel ) . 
   not really all that strange if you consider that people also believe there is an all powerful man looking down on us from the sky deciding our lives . 
  to be honest , i find * that * pretty strange as well . 
  and i 'd be outraged if somebody would stop public infrastructure ( or anything else ) `` because god does not want it '' . 
  there should be no place for non-evidence-based arguments in public debate . 
  she 's not suing the us broker - \u00d6bb are a defendant in the current case ( somebody posted some court documents in this thread ; it 's in there as well ) . 
  but even if she had purchased the ticket directly from \u00d6bb in the us - she was injured using a service in austria , and that service should fall under austrian safety regulations , judged by austrian courts . 
  good point , but that 's irrelevant to the actual outrage , which is the decision to grant her the right to sue in the us . 
  whether the suit is frivolous or not should be the decision of austrian courts . 
  i like the premise behind `` europe should not be a continent '' . 
  yeah , let 's stop that . 
  being a continent is so 20th century anyway !, 
  nor is lebanon , yet it is included in the map . 
  `` another '' ? 
  as a german , i found dutch incredibly easy to read . 
  read mulisch in the original after a few months of studying in amsterdam ( in english ) and without having had any formal instruction . 
  speaking it as a whole other issue , though . 
  even if that is true , many of them still are quite xenophobic . 
  i try that every time they 're walking on the bike lane :p, 
  the one my tag links to unfortunately is [ deleted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2wdyg5/one_of_the_most_important_places_for_us_to_bug_is/coq53no ) ; but given the responses , i 'm pretty sure it said `` fuck gypsies '' . 
  nah , your racist comments do . 
  been with an `` ethical '' bank for years . 
  grew about 30 % per year during the crisis . 
  invests only in real , on the ground projects . 
  yeah , i 'd keep sending my money there . 
  small size and high population density are irrelevant for urban transport . 
  unless you 've brought it unto yourself with massive sprawl , cities are pretty similar in this regard . 
  flat terrain is a bit of a different issue , but few cities are genuinely so hilly you can not cycle there ( and even then , electrified bikes can be a very suitable solution ) . 
  as for inter-city traffic , trains work well in countries larger than the netherlands ( see : germany , japan ) . 
  some density is helpful , but also a given in many places that still rely on cars . 
  and by teleportation you mean bicycles and a decently functioning public transit system ? 
  it 's miraculous - * miraculous * - how the dutch get around . 
  every single pro-immigration comment here gets downvoted into oblivion , and you claim * i * am delegitimising the other side 's arguments ? 
  i do n't think you 're being honest with yourself here . 
  really ? 
  i live in one of the most livable cities on earth . 
  half of its inhabitants have direct foreign ancestry . 
  and no , i 'm not suffering , just the opposite . 
  people say the downvotes you are getting are due to brigading , but i 'm not sure about that . 
  i fear a lot of people are genuinely that racist . 
  at times i think it would be better to have a european union comprised of open-minded places . 
  there 's enough of them - ironically they 're where most immigrants live , too . 
  you said he did not finish his degree . 
  that 's at least grossly misleading , given that he already held an equivalent degree . 
  do n't see anything wrong with not following through on a second degree when other opportunities arise . 
  the last common ancestor would 've been a great ape , too , though . 
  so , we * are * descended from apes . 
  at that time , the netherlands did not have a bachelor/master system . 
  dijsselbloem graduated with a degree of * ingenieur * , which is equivalent to a master of science degree . 
  you could 've found out about that by simply [ checking wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jeroen_dijsselbloem ) . 
  homophobia is n't a clinically recognised phobia , and the term is n't used as such . 
  it 's not * that * much higher with n ~ 300 , though . 
  about 6 % . 
  sample size really is n't the biggest cause of uncertainty in polls anyway ; sampling bias is much more problematic . 
  exactly . 
  it 's not valid , but she still fears homosexuals will cause harm . 
  that 's , like , the definition of homophobia , is n't it ? 
  unfounded fears . 
  i do n't want to break out a discussion about her politics here , but i think people mistake her pragmatism as being pragmatic about what works for her electorate . 
  she is n't - she 's pragmatic about what will secure her power base . 
  a truly pragmatic politician would n't allow for such ridiculous undertakings as the herdpr\u00e4mie and pkw-maut under her watch . 
  besides , she 's * the * major driving force behind the austerity policies that are driving much of europe into ruin without effecting the kind of structural reforms that would in fact be necessary ( and be sure to recognise that merkel 's brand of austerity is n't supported by the state of the science ) . 
  the fact that these policies are hardly questioned in germany really is shocking . 
  it 's easy to see this as mere power politics ( merkels specialty , and disgusting in its own right ) ; but the tone of the comment is , for her unusually , personal . 
  it seems she went beyond what she had to see out of political opportunism there , which makes me think that it 's a genuine sentiment . 
  i 'm sure she does have those , too , however well hidden they normally are . 
  i 'd be surprised to find merkel a fanatic in anything - she 's appears a pragmatic through and through ; sometimes to the people 's service , sometimes to our disservice . 
  the fact that she 's so beloved is what worries me , though . 
  `` mutti merkel '' ( how i hate that designation ! ), 
  is a homophobe . 
  more progressive than * their * own chancellor , too . 
  on zeit online yesterday , conservative politician jens spahn ( who is gay ) [ called for muslims to embrace gay marriage ] ( http://www.zeit.de/2015/24/homophobie-homosexualitaet-islam ) . 
  my first thought ? 
  his own , angela merkel 's governing party is the only thing between germany and gay marriage right now . 
  yup . 
  those people who re-elected george w. bush ? 
  not just quietly condoning war crimes . 
  i once met the founder of the association of danish-puerto rican society . 
  as far as i know , there 's about six of them . 
  edit : found their [ site ] ( http://www.puertodansk.org/?page_id=3 ) . 
  six confirmed danish-puerto ricans , worldwide . 
  not really . 
  fremdsch\u00e4men is really on behalf of somebody else , who might have no relation with you ( people you overhear talking loudly in the bus , that kinda thing ) . 
  g\u00eanant actually has the same root as * genieren * in german , which i think also fits better . 
  the terror often comes from within . 
  there 's a great museum in budapest called the [ house of terror ] ( http://www.terrorhaza.hu/ ) . 
  it commemorates the victims of hungary 's fascist and communist dictatorships . 
  yup . 
  `` my country '' , in fact , is n't meaningful to me . 
  in my case , citizenship and residence do n't align ; for many others , things are even more complicated . 
  fighting for ideas ? 
  perhaps . 
  i do n't think i 'm the type who would 've joined the international brigades , but i can recognise resistance to fascism as meaningful at least . 
  there 's no way they got a representative sample from papua new guinea .
