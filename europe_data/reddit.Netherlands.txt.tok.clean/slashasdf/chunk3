  they did not fire their regular street crews , you ca n't simply fire people and rehire them for a lower wage in the netherlands , you 'd need to get permission from a court to do this ( which they would never get without a good reason , especially not a local government ) . 
  the only way they can do something like this is letting contracts expire , then six months after they 've been unemployed they can rehire them on new terms ( otherwise their old contract has to be renewed ) . 
  this however only applies to people with temporary contracts , since many people have contracts that do n't expire ( unlimited time contracts ) . 
  however , you could argue that the unemployed people who are now working for ` free ' ( if they do n't their unemployment benefits are cut or canceled ) with the street cleaning crews are occupying jobs . 
  regardless , since this concerns people who simply have n't bothered to look for a job for a long time or have been really unsuccessful in their efforts , they are now actually working a little for the money they receive which is a good thing . 
  because there are certain lowlifes in our country that think they can do anything and are above the law . 
  these people are fucking pathetic and should be punished harshly whenever this happens . 
  this is what happened . 
  the rotten core of soccer `` fans '' ruined it , they where the ones who started throwing stuff at the me and at windows of stores , you could hear them chanting soccer songs in the videos . 
  according to media , there were less than a thousand when things started escalating . 
  no , the police was there from the start , a bunch of drunks started vandalizing , police intervened , and it escalated . 
  the police was there because they expected thousands to show up in this small town while there was no party . 
  they simply stood by and did n't do anything until people started vandalizing and lighting things on fire . 
  the police intervened which a group of hooligans saw as an opportunity to escalate the situation . 
  they can protest all they want , but it 's simply unacceptable to threaten to * kill * people , threatening to murder someone is not protected free speech . 
  they want to exercise their rights , that 's perfectly fine , but they will do it within the boundaries of the law . 
  rioting , destroying property , threatening with murder is * not * acceptable . 
  yes , i do n't have anything against muslims , christians or any religion ( i 'm not religious though ) , and i respect their right to believe whatever they want . 
  i 'm fine with them coming here to create a better future for themselves . 
  ** but ** if you show complete disregard for our society and values , our fundamental freedoms , then you can gtfo . 
  you do n't have ** any ** right to come here and tell us that people should * die * because they 're expressing an opinion that you strongly disagree with . 
  `` i did n't see movie , i heard someone say that someone else said bad things about our prophet !, 
  '' , `` so you do n't actually know what you 're talking about ? '', 
  while that was indeed a very decisive battle against the ottomans , what about the [ battle of vienna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vienna ) on september 11 and 12 , 1683 ? 
  11,000 viennese soldiers who refused to surrender before the 150,000-300 ,000 men of the ottoman empire . 
  it was the start of the war and this battle marked the end of the ottoman expansion in europe . 
  netherlands here , i 've never seen anything like this . 
  looks cool though . 
  yes i just stopped listening to radio , so little variation nowadays . 
  yeah it 's so awesome that whenever you take a bike trip more than 10 minutes away it 's pretty much mandatory you bring a raincoat . 
  do n't know about sweden , but here you can usually just ask where you want to be seated , or if you buy tickets online you can just click on the seats you want . 
  yeah the highest point in the netherlands is a hill and we call it the ` vaalser-mountain ' ( around 322meters above sea level ) . 
  that song is beautiful, 
  not for me , i < 3 belgium . 
  one thing that bothers me though is the confusing or sometimes non existing traffic signs . 
  but i guess i 'm spoiled here in the netherlands where there 's traffic signs all over the place . 
  never really have trouble with my bike , except in some cities traffic lights are horribly inefficient , there 's a few in rotterdam where often everyone is standing still at the lights for several minutes . . 
  yeah , my sister lives in friesland as well , she pays around 350/month for a one family home . 
  i live in rotterdam and pay 380/month for a 45m2 studio appartment . 
  so it really depends on where you live . 
  yes , i am definitely not a libertarian myself , i even believe a government should provide all essentials ( infrastructure , water , electricity , healthcare , education , etc. ) . 
  i think if , for example , there would be like a government owned construction company that has to compete with other construction companies for government projects that this would increase efficiency and specialist knowledge in the government . 
  this in turn could improve government decision-making and lawmaking . 
  i have to say governments can be quite competent in wasting money . 
  for example here they wanted to build a new cargo-railroad ( betuwelijn ) to germany , est. 
  costs would be $ 2,7 billion , costs to date are over $ 4,7 billion . 
  another example : a province had its logo redesigned , design costs ( not implementation ) : ~ $ 300.000 , - i mean , come on ? 
  i think a lot of austerity measures would n't even be necessary if governments would try to be more efficient . 
  wow , at least someone who does n't oversimplify and just states ` greeks are lazy and do n't pay taxes ' as the main reason for their problems . 
  the reason they do n't pay taxes as they should is not because they are ` evil ' or ` lazy ' or something , it 's a symptom of a more fundamental problem in their political system , and i believe corruption in the greek government is their biggest threat . 
  while it is true that greeks work harder than germans , the german economy is much stronger and competitive than the greek economy . 
  however since we share a common currency germany should help greece become more competitive , and germany thinks the best way is to force austerity measures on greece . 
  well we have all seen how well this has worked in the past few years ... 
  while national pride is good , it should be based in reality , or it will become some sort of nationalistic ` our country is better because it 's our country ' nonsense . 
  i guess we are lucky elections are coming , otherwise i 'm not so sure if the vvd would have blocked acta . 
  even if it is sarcasm this will help , since the 2nd chamber has stated they will try to block acta from passing in the eu parliament . 
  i guess this is a good sign , seems we still have some politicians who refuse to discuss nonsense . 
  i mean , why does it matter if a country no longer wishes to waste money on an advisory institution ? 
  heh , that proves the reporter was right to criticize them . 
  also the azerbaijani news report is ridiculous , almost seems inspired by some north korean press releases . 
  from what i can understand he was basically arrested for criticizing azerbaijan ? 
  yes , adults should absolutely take responsibility for their decisions , but i believe people would make more rational decisions in elections if they were better informed about the consequences of their decisions and the decisions their politicians make . 
  the problem is that governing a country is increasingly becoming more and more complex , this is n't easy for a regular person to keep track of . 
  this then creates a situation where politicians know their voters do n't fully understand issues , so they can often twist the story and lie to get reelected and/or push their own issues forward . 
  their decisions are often also influenced by lobbyists and nepotism . 
  further , i agree that governments and politicians should be accountable , even after they have left office . 
  so while i do n't believe people can always make properly informed decisions while voting for politicians , there should at least be made an effort to inform these voters more . 
  but a higher responsibility lies with the politicians who are making the real decisions . 
  tbh , i believe that what the greek government did was basically sabotaging their own country and should be seen as treason . 
  not really , a lot less sweaty men hugging than with soccer . 
  i understand that they were elected by the greek people , but this still does n't justify putting the blame on the people . 
  the problem is that many people ( not just in greece , but i think this is true for every democracy ) do n't fully understand the effects of the actions of their government , they just decide by the ( short-term ) ` results ' their government produces . 
  i have seen the same thing happen in my own country ( the netherlands ) , things that seem like a great idea and provide growth for the economy while costing us a lot in the long-term . 
  an example of this is the ` hypotheekrenteaftrek ' ( english : mortgage interest tax deduction ) . 
  so my point is , it is only after people see the long-term effects of government policies that they realize they were wrong . 
  such as is the case in greece now , people fully realize how foolish their government was ... but hindsight never was a useful superpower , 
  while it can indeed work , the problem is that europe and the imf want it to work now . 
  these are all long-term solutions of which europe and the imf expect immediate results , which is simply impossible . 
  people like lagarde seem to live in their own comfortable bubble ... also i do n't hate greeks , i hate the government ( s ) who allowed the crises to happen ( not just the greek debt-crisis ) and our failing shortsighted european institutions . 
  while i agree people should pay their taxes if they expect a functioning nation , i disagree on putting the blame on the greeks themselves . 
  their government knew they had a big debt and they had massive tax-dodging going on , yet they waited until it was ( almost ) too late to do something about it . 
  while austerity can work , the way it was implemented did not work and it was definitely not modest considering the situation . 
  in greece they cut government spending very hard , for example pensions were sometimes halved and public sector pay was cut . 
  this decreased people 's spending in a very large sector , which was bad for the recovering economy . 
  further the greek government did not reduce the tax burden , they added new corporate taxes while raising existing ones , they raised vat and added new luxury taxes . 
  this then decreased spending even more . 
  so everything becomes more expensive while people continually have less to spend , so how does this help the economy ? 
  these measures were a requirement for getting new loans for the greek government . 
  and to make matters worse , after greece got these loans their rating was reduced ( because they loaned so much ) , which increased interest on these loans . 
  this put them in a position were their governments income was continually decreasing while suddenly having a lot more expenses . 
  so now they have put themselves , or have been put , in a situation where they can not get out by themselves ( without causing even more damage to the economy ) . 
  yes , this bailout gave institutions like the imf even more power . 
  they lend a shit-ton of money to greece , then they raise interest on those loans because greece has too many loans . 
  this made greece go from a country with a high debt but still solvent to an insolvent country with high debt . 
  also , euro-zone countries have almost no power to fix debt-issues by themselves once they escalate . 
  but of course the blame lies with greek citizens , citizens who worked longer and harder than almost any other european nation before the crisis . 
  this is nothing more than pushing someone in a corner and bullying them . 
  their economy was doing bad so they implemented austerity measures , the result of this was an even worse economy with massive unemployment , and now they need to implement even more austerity measures ... 
  if people do n't have jobs or money how are they going to pay their taxes ? 
  indeed , even before the rise of nationalism europe was unable to be united .
