  your idiot president decided not to . 
  not the other way around . 
  the deal was that your country would implement and adhere to a very specific set of rules before visa free travel would be implemented . 
  erdogan signed up to that . 
  and erdogan had no other intention than using it as a political tool . 
  as per usual , belgium disappoints . 
  do n't you know ? 
  not voting for erdogan means you support terrorism !!! 1 !! one !!!, 
  i 'd say it was prudence . 
  good . 
  voting with our wallets . 
  edit : i should add that though the russian tourism glut is the focus of this article , since turkey arrested a prominent dutch journalist last month as well as the appalling human rights situation , i can guarantee you that tourism from the eu is also dieing . 
  except you have to be a turkish national to get the bus to munich without needing a visa at the border . 
  those damn tourists . . coming over here , spending their money . 
  buying the newest shit to impress their neighbours and enrich their friends at home . 
  how dare they . 
  it 's people like that that are actually out there , going around and literally creating jobs . 
  interesting . 
  i always wondered if juncker 's name had connotations with the dutch title ` jonkheer ' , an aristocratic title . 
  what the fucking fuck , poland ? 
  have you forgotten [ how your own people were treated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust_in_poland ) at the hands of [ people just like kim ] ( http://theweek.com/articles/450792/north-korea-isnt-nazi-germany--some-ways-worse ) ? 
  what is this ? 
  how the fucking fuck do a ] people not revolt against these concentration-camp supporting employers and b ] not throw the politicians who 're in on the deal ( and you know they are ) into the river at gdansk ? 
  see . . that 's why amsterdam is still the center of the world ; we 're one of the [ ` safe ' cities for the jews ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mokum ) . 
  they taught us how to use guilt . . which is how we came up with the [ stock market ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amsterdam_stock_exchange#history ) . . and why our money was called the [ guilder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_guilder ) . 
  jews . 
  that was the implication . 
  genuine question : how did he loose his marbles ? 
  expect . 
  alternatively , if everyone was a jew , there would n't be much of a problem except for some introspection . 
  and we 're one united country , not two badly managed ones under one roof . 
  that verdict has been in since the cardboard ladas . 
  the little boy with the nato flag was awesome . 
  belgium is a broken country . 
  roads broken , terrorists ignored , drug trafficking , their nuclear power stations are unsafe . 
  is it any wonder a judge like who releases terror suspects can exist within their political/judicial system . 
  having the eu headquarters there is such a joke . 
  i do n't think anyone was thinking . 
  i do n't believe a word of that . 
  vwo is tough as nails and even the oral exam for french is fucking hard with two teachers waiting to have a full on conversation with you about the dordogne . 
  so how is requiring the people who enter the eu from other nations be checked out and their travel documents registered in any way not a federal task ? 
  i really do n't see your issue with this . 
  why ? 
  i think this is exactly what 's needed , next to bulking out frontex to secure our southern and eastern flanks . 
  interesting . 
  the netherlands voted no as well in that referendum . 
  to have that as the only argument for leaving the eurozone and the eu is not enough , though , in my opinion ... 
  i also like setting my house on fire without any insurance . 
  you ca n't compare predictions on a fundamentally broken system with those on a functional one . 
  when has the eu screwed france over ? 
  afaik the eu has bent backwards to accommodate the french when it comes to agriculture . 
  i 'm genuinely curious what real argument can be made here ... 
   `` the brits have the best diplomatic corps in the world , '' said a member of the german parliament . 
  `` most of what they do is come in , smile and act friendly . 
  but they do n't say anything of substance . '' i wonder if the # 350 million for the nhs will mostly have to be spent on burn units . 
  hurry up and declare independence , scotland !, 
  us dutchies need our irn bru and you scots need to add bitterballen and frikandellen to your fry-up diet . 
  edit : ooh . 
  salty . 
  like my friet met mayo . 
  he 's a brexiteer from northern ireland whose only chance of having brexit turn out okay for his area is if europe suddenly breaks up and he can crow about how britain is still relevant in a world where europe is made up of infighting bigots . 
  so screwing over your other neighbours and friends by leaving the eu and the euro is the obvious answer ? 
  not too long ago is more than 15 years . 
  got it . 
  `` i wash my hands of this situation '' -- no dutch guy ever , 
  you 're a straight up liar . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/23/gibraltar-votes-overwhelming-to-remain/ 96 % for remain . 
  coming from a nation where bathing was considered optional until the mid 90s , that 's pretty rich . 
  except , you know , if they vote to rejoin spain . 
  afaik 95 % of gibraltar voted to remain in the eu . 
  if they decide they want to join spain by referendum , which is what spain would like them to have the chance to do ... do you really think that the uk would go to war over it ? 
  i think the word ` uh-oh ' would be appropriate . 
  we 'll wait for boris johnson then . 
  same with eu banking . 
  no sense in keeping it there . 
  sexy airplane erotica ... 
  i 'm not sure there 's a market for it . 
   also , do you think a single sneeze could mean death for those pilots ? 
  [ depends where they 're flying ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bjp6l3-1k0 ) , i guess  but i think they 're okay . . you do n't hear of too many crashes . 
  heh good idea . 
  stephen fry or attenborough ... with cameos by brian blessed . 
  yeah . . do n't fucking loose that winning streak , though , mate . . it 's not going in the right direction for you guys at the moment . 
  time to blanda up with the eu and become the leaders in global aviation and space technology again , i say . 
  i 've only experienced it twice . 
  first time was when i was living in japan as a kid in the 80s as the brat of an expat . 
  we used to fly back and forth between the netherlands and tokyo yearly for summer holidays . 
  at that time you were n't allowed to fly over the ussr , so you had to fly amsterdam -  anchorage , alaska and then anchorage -  tokyo . 
  as you flew over that corridor you entered usaf controlled airspace as you were coming over japan . 
  once we were just entering japan and i was doing something ( ca n't remember - reading probably - these flights were loooong ass hauls in the old 747s and i was like 10 ) . 
  i look out the window at the wing for a while , dreaming away with the clouds passing below and without warning an [ f-15 ] ( https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--f78ffh2t--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1427441623073395015.png ) pops up from under the wing , close enough to the wing to see the missiles clearly . . and with the two airmen clearly visible . 
  i almost shat myself . 
  my sister and i waved like mad at them , but i doubt they could see us . 
  they did do a little wing-wiggle for the benefit of the passengers though , 
  it is nice . 
   i love our modern world . 
  there are so many aspects happening at all times around us . 
  when you 're in an airplane and it accelerates for take-off the fanblades of the engine spin faster , causing higher compression in the compression chamber which then is ignited and forced out the back of the engine , causing the airplane to go faster and the fanblades to spin faster because there 's more wind to turn them . 
  the airplane is moving forward and at the instance of takeoff because of the shape of the wings the air passing under the wing is faster than the air over the wing , causing an air pressure differential . 
  and then you 're aloft , the ground receding like a skewed painting , a view you 've likely never seen outside of an aircraft . . cars dwindling in size as they drop away , lost as you enter your first cloud . 
  it 's spectacular .
