  yes . 
  yes i have . 
  and believe me . . none of it is possible ; - de-islamisation of the netherlands ? 
  requires him to have a 3/4ths majority in both the senate and parliament because it needs a constitutional change - getting the netherlands out of the eu ? 
  good luck without a referendum , which he simply can not win as he represents less than 20 % of the electorate . 
  - direct implementation of a binding referendum on issues ? 
  good luck . 
  3/4ths majority needed as it 's a constitutional change - get rid of own risk in healthcare - hahahaha . 
  - he wants to reduce rental prices - no mention of how . 
  that 's physically impossible , same as reducing the age of retirement . 
  there simply is n't the money for it . 
  i can go on . . but none of it is remotely possible without a clear 50 % win . . and that 's just never going to happen . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  mods do n't delete or ban people for their opinions . 
  they ban them for being racist fucks . 
  are you a racist fuck ? 
  also , what 's this stupidity about pim fortuyn ? 
  i ca n't respect someone 's opinion even if i disagree with them ? 
  you seem completely unhinged . 
   heres a little song i wrote . . you might want to sing it note for note  do n't worry , be happy  in every election we have some trouble  but when you worry you make it double  do n't worry , be happy ; do n't worry be happy now  do n't worry ; be happy  do n't worry ; be happy  ai n't got no place to lay your head  [ geert ] ( http://media.nu.nl/m/m1mxxlpaumi4_wd1280.jpg/demonstratie-in-zweden-geert-wilders.jpg ) says asylumseeker came and took your bed  do n't worry ; be happy  [ rutte ] ( https://www.government.nl/binaries/small/content/gallery/government/content-afbeeldingen/regering/bewindspersonen/kabinet-rutte-asscher/rutte-mark/mp-rutte.jpg ) say the economy great  own rental payment already late  dont worry ( hahahahahaha ) be happy ( look at me i 'm happy )  do n't worry ; be happy  hey i give you / r/the _ klaver 's number when you worried go to them , they 'll make you happy  do n't worry ; be happy  aint got no cash ; aint got no style  aint got no [ stientje ] ( http://www.p-plus.nl/resources/articlephotos/large/stientjevanveldhoven.jpg ) to make you smile  but do n't worry ; be happy  cause when you worry [ pechtold ] ( http://metronieuws.tcdn.nl/field/image/9b2db721f2f321c3b34df3282e0d6431-1487778954.jpg ) will frown  and that will bring everybody down so  do n't worry ; be happy  dont worry be happy now ; do n't worry . 
  be happy . 
   it might seem crazy what i am about to say  election 's here , do n't take a break  i 'm a hot air balloon , in jesse klaver 's face  with the ascher , like i do n't care , baby , by the way  ( because i 'm happy )  vote along if you feel like a roemer without a roof  ( because i 'm happy )  vote along if you feel like geert is the truth  ( because i 'm happy )  vote along if you know what rutte is to you  ( because i 'm happy )  clap along if you feel like pechtold is who you wan na do  here come bad news , talking this and that ( yeah ! ), 
   well , vote for denk , do n't hold it back ( yeah ! ), 
   well , i should probably warn ya , i 'll be just fine ( yeah ! ), 
   no offense to 50 + , do n't waste your time  here 's why ... 
  i think a robust and good policy change is needed for that . 
  there 's no way to see if something works as expected definitively in the real world unless you at least attempt it . . and i think we 've seen that our current policy can be altered to make it both safer for consumers and provide for adequate governmental oversight ( and extra tax revenue ) . 
  i mean . . we 're talking about removing the illegal aspects of coffeeshops by regulating their supply lines , and not a free-for-all come here and smoke your face off policy . 
  it 's hardly a paradigm shift if you ask me . 
  let the voedsel en waren authority deal with them instead of shady back-room growers . 
   i think so too , but can we really say that for sure ? 
  no we ca n't . 
  yes we can . 
  look at [ colorado ] ( http://www.rogersandmoss.com/blog/14-criminal-law-articles/56-two-years-later-has-the-legalization-of-marijuana-affected-crime-in-colorado ) and closer to home portugal 's crime rate drop  despite claims to the contrary ,34 decriminalisation appears to have had a positive effect on crime . 
  with its recategorisation of low-level drug possession as an administrative rather than criminal offence , decriminalisation inevitably produced a reduction in the number of people arrested and sent to criminal court for drug offences -- from over 14,000 in the year 2000 , to around 5,500-6 ,000 per year once the policy had come into effect .35 the proportion of drug-related offenders ( defined as those who committed offences under the influence of drugs and/or to fund drug consumption ) in the portuguese prison population also declined , from 44 % in 1999 , to just under 21 % in 2012.36  additionally , decriminalisation does not appear to have caused an increase in crimes typically associated with drugs . 
  while opportunistic thefts and robberies had gone up when measured in 2004 , it has been suggested that this may have been because police were able to use the time saved by no longer arresting drug users to tackle ( and record ) other low-level crimes .37 although difficult to test , this theory is perhaps supported by the fact that , during the same period , there was a reduction in recorded cases of other , more complex crimes typically committed by people who are dependent on drugs , such as thefts from homes and businesses . 
  http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blog/drug-decriminalisation-portugal-setting-record-straight there 's loads of evidence that it 's a net positive . 
  the thing we have to be worried about in this country is the amphetamine production . 
   our politics are in a sad state :( i ca n't even get behind the people i agree with do n't worry so much  most of them might be idiots , but i think it 's hardly fair to say that politics in this country is in a sad state . 
  we 've got the best democratic system in the world , in a country where almost nobody gets what they want but almost everybody gets what they need . 
  look at the countries around us and tell me we 're in a sadder state than them . 
  i think that 's only true for some . 
  i 'm voting for pechtold . 
  he 's a cool-headed guy who 's pro-eu , has good plans for closing all coal power-plants and i like his ideas on how to balance the cost of healthcare . 
  also : number 2 on d66 's list - [ stientje < 3 van veldhoven ] ( https://d66.nl/mensen/stientje-van-veldhoven/ ) . 
  she 's got a good head on her shoulders . 
  well . . wilders is a giant pussy , so i would n't expect anything else from him than to actually want to be pm . 
  look at his platform . 
  nothing in his manifesto is remotely possible to do . 
  he wants to be the crybully . 
  god i wish pim fortuyn was still alive . 
  i might not have agreed with his policies , but he 'd have torn geert a new asshole . 
  i 'm calling it now : vvd , cda , d66 + some other party , though i doubt it 's going to be groenlinks . 
  we could combine the two and wall them off ... 
  the first message is when your client connects with the api for the very first connection . 
  a salted key is generated at the api and then sent back to the client . 
  that key is used to encrypt all traffic using aes . 
  so yes , it is still vulnerable . . but it 's only for a few seconds as a new salted key is generated and then a new aes encrypted key is valid and the old one is discarded . 
  its only vulnerability is in that initial connection between the api and the client . 
  i 'm waiting for my ssl cert from my hosting provider . 
  however , it 's not unencrypted atm either . 
  i 'm using an aes encryption using a negotiated salted key to encrypt all traffic between client and api . 
  i 'm based in the netherlands . 
  i 'd be happy to look at your project for you if you like . . though i 'm very reticent in accepting assignments at the moment . 
  let me know what it is and i 'll see . 
   yeah , but i do n't like promises , but async is awesome !, 
  i do n't mind either . 
  i use promises in the front-end and async in the back-end atm   do you use some kind of orm/odm for db not really . 
  i dislike orms when it comes to making the more complex queries , so i decided to write it out in pure sql . 
  for example one of these queries for getting all the comment reply data is hard to make happen in orm without it costing waaay too much proc-time :  select ict.id , active as status , parent_id , text , date_created , date_edited , name as user_name , ( coalesce ( vup.votes ,0 ) + coalesce ( vdown.votes ,0 ) ) as votes_total , ( coalesce ( vup.votes ,0 ) - coalesce ( vdown.votes ,0 ) ) as votes_sum , icr.reported , ( coalesce ( icvup.votes ,0 ) + coalesce ( icvdown.votes ,0 ) ) as user_vote_total , ( coalesce ( icvup.votes ,0 ) - coalesce ( icvdown.votes ,0 ) ) as user_vote_sum from ( select ic.id , ic.active , ic.parent _ id , icd.text , icd.date _ created , icd.date _ edited , u.name , u.id as uid from item_comments as ic inner join item_comment_data icd on icd.ic _ id = ic.id inner join users u on u.id = ic.user _ id where ic.active ! = 3 and ic.id in ( select id from ( select * from item_comments order by parent_id , id ) base , ( select @pv : = ? ), 
  tmp where find_in_set ( parent_id , @pv )  0 and @pv : = concat ( @pv , '' , '' , id ) ) ) as ict left join ( select count ( * ) as votes , ic_id from item_comment_votes where dir = 1 group by ic_id ) as vup on vup.ic _ id = ict.id left join ( select count ( * ) as votes , ic_id from item_comment_votes where dir = 2 group by ic_id ) as vdown on vdown.ic _ id = ict.id left join ( select count ( * ) as reported , ic_id from item_comment_reports group by ic_id ) as icr on icr.ic _ id = ict.id left join ( select count ( * ) as votes , any_value ( pdsd_ic . user_id ) as user_id from item_comment_votes as pdsd_icv inner join item_comments pdsd_ic on pdsd_icv . ic_id = pdsd_ic . id where pdsd_icv . dir = 2 and pdsd_icv . dt  ? 
  group by pdsd_ic . user_id ) as icvdown on icvdown.user _ id = uid left join ( select count ( * ) as votes , any_value ( pdsu_ic . user_id ) as user_id from item_comment_votes as pdsu_icv inner join item_comments pdsu_ic on pdsu_icv . ic_id = pdsu_ic . id where pdsu_icv . dir = 1 and pdsu_icv . dt  ? 
  group by pdsu_ic . user_id ) as icvup on icvup.user _ id = uid order by parent_id , id, 
   all news reports from more higher quality sources get posted automatically and lower quality never shows up i do n't mind adding pulp like rt or the daily fail , but in that case i 'd expect the users to make that distinction themselves by either up or downvoting appropriately . 
  if you see a fluff story , by all means use your downvote . 
   each site has an up/downvote score . . so you can see what the general trend is . 
  i plan on having cool graphs on news source reliability as well . . though i have n't yet found a cool library to use for that . 
   nodejs is not a framework yeah . . 
  i was wrong to put it like that . 
   single threaded not that much of a disadvantage , i 've noticed . 
  async is available as module . 
  promises < 3 . 
  it 's not that bad , mate   i would use nodejs only on specific scenarios where php ca n't do the job ( realtime , websockets , etc ) . 
  nspider.net is all websocket based . 
  it uses socket.io for everything instead of rest . 
  it 's just so much faster . 
   right now it just seems to be a news aggregrator without any user input ? 
  you can log in and register top-right . 
   so you say we should trust you with regards to the article 's content being genuine or not because of what reason exactly i admit that was worded a bit stupidly . 
  i intend to only crawl legitimate news sources such as newspapers , local or otherwise . 
  iexpect the users determine the validity and genuine-ness of articles themselves . . that 's what the down and upvote buttons are for in the end . 
   btw , you 're from portugal , correct ? 
  can you give me the names of some portuguese news sources i can add ? 
  nodejs is a framework you can use to serve front-end content with , true . . but it 's much more than just a front-end framework . 
  [ check it out ] ( https://nodejs.org/en/about/ ) . 
  it 's really effing cool . 
  i restarted the api to make sure it all went okay . . 
  i hope nobody else gets the problem . 
  i should switch over to forever instead of relying only on linux services , perhaps . 
  there might be a bug somewhere which crashes the api which has escaped me .
