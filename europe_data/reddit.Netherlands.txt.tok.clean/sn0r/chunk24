  there is many options how to cooperate in europe without eu . 
  afterall , until 1992 it worked just fine . 
  it worked fine because there were two organisations which co-opted europe : nato and the eez . 
  with the collapse of communism in the east a new structure was necessary to bind europe together . 
  nato is still the military pillar of europe , while politically it has become the eu . 
   the treaty on european union ( teu ) , signed in maastricht on 7 february 1992 , entered into force on 1 november 1993 . 
  this treaty is the result of external and internal events . 
  at external level , the collapse of communism in eastern europe and the outlook of german reunification led to a commitment to reinforce the community 's international position . 
  at internal level , the member states wished to supplement the progress achieved by the single european act with other reforms . 
  there 's no alternative to the eu that does n't protect us all from ourselves . 
  none . 
  we can decide not to be part of the eu and suffer the consequences of a divided europe again , where war is maybe not inevitable , but a lot more likely . 
  and i 'd rather fix the eu than suffer the economic , political and social consequences of the alternatives . 
  we have managed so far . . regardless of any doom-mongers and gloomy predictions to the contrary . 
  good . 
  it 's important to be critical of the eu . 
  it 's equally important to see that it 's the best solution we 've managed to come up with and there are no reasonable alternatives to it . 
  support the eu by voting and by being critical of it in a constructive manner . 
  to stay _ there _ long . 
  go to bed , irishman . 
  you 're drunk . 
  i feel not enough people actually know what 's going on in europe . 
  i think we need more interaction with the eu and the what the european union actually does for people . 
  [ we 're actually partly swamp germans , descended from the batavi anyway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/batavi_ ( germanic_tribe \\ ) ) . . so you 're totally right . 
  charlemagne empire now plz . 
  the eu is n't like a restaurant . 
  it 's a marriage . 
  promises have been made , financial obligations have to be untangled . 
  it 's a lot more messy than just paying your bill and getting up and leaving the table . 
  edit : debts -  promises . 
  how incredibly cynical and unenlightened of you . 
  the swiss are lovely people . 
  i 'm married to a english/swiss lady whose family hails from around basel . 
  they 're generous , funny , direct and maybe somewhat insular in their ways when you go into the countryside but still incredibly welcoming to outsiders . 
  as a dutch person from the south i feel very at home there . 
  culturally , they 're very much a mountain people , with beautiful castles and a history of resisting change from outside by banding together as a people ( schwabenkrieg anyone ? ) . 
  i think you should visit before you make any snap judgement about them . 
  for the dutch ` wenen ' also means to weep/cry . 
  bunch of crybabies . 
  as a dutchman of pure orange blood ... sure why not  edit : to convince my dutch brethren i shall point them to our heritage ; the ancient story of [ karel ende elegast ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/elegast#karel_ende_elegast ) . 
  first britain has to agree to the method of calculation . 
  there is no point discussing amounts if the u.k. is n't willing to accept the figures presented . 
   barnier and his team have worked out and shared a methodology for computing the u.k. 's financial obligations . 
  as in any divorce in which one side feels badly jilted , it is designed to keep london on the hook long after it officially walks out -- not only to plug a looming hole in the eu budget , but also to ensure the u.k. can not back out too soon from projects it agreed to finance as a stakeholder in the european investment bank . 
  i do n't think he 's lieing . 
  as far as i 've understood it it went something like this :  eu : here 's a bill of what you owe  u.k. : what ?!, 
  that 's way too much . 
  we 're not paying that !, 
   eu : okay ... are you actually going to pay what you owe ? 
   u.k. : maaaaaaaaybe ? 
   eu : alright . . how much do you think you owe then ? 
   u.k. : i 'm not telling you shit . 
  why have n't you done your homework ? 
   barnier told ambassadors to the eu that the british government had so far been unable to provide sufficient clarity on its positions during the last week of talks , leaving him pessimistic about the future . 
  that 's a really nice way of saying `` britain shit their bed so hard they 're still cleaning up the sheets . '',

  according to star trek , a united ireland happens in 2024 by `` republican terrorists '' . . https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_star_trek so that 's when sinn fein win their first election . 
  like i said . . talking about it now is just silly , 
  i do agree that asking for reparations at this point is silly . 
  besides , it brings back certain connotations to the unfair deal germany was given after wwi , which was definitely a factor in starting wwii . 
  let 's not make that mistake again . 
   also , as an eu country , germany has done nothing but right for the continent so far as far as i can see . . and with poland and germany being in the eu together has got to count for something . 
  but you should 've paid a bit more than a 1/100th of it . 
   later in that article it is stated that the actual amount paid by germany was around 1/500th of that . 
  you 're right there . 
  i first thought the exchange rate between 1975 and today would 've taken care of that difference , but then i checked it and went ` oh ' .

  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_reparations_for_world_war_ii  material recompensation incurred by germany has been estimated as approximately $ 525 billion or $ 640 billion in 2004 exchange values . 
  edit : as / u/nieuchwytnyuchwyt said . . that actually _ has n't been paid _ for the most part . 
  i am disappoint , germany . 
  edit2 : maybe slightly disappoint is a better way for me to say it . 
  it 's a long time ago and germany is in the eu now . 
  i saw this [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/zcmnc4m.jpg ) on / r/europe here yesterday . 
  it 's nazi propaganda . 
  https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/mobile/en/article.php?moduleid=10007822  a recurrent theme in nazi antisemitic propaganda was that jews spread diseases . 
   to prevent non-jews from attempting to enter the ghettos and from seeing the condition of daily life there for themselves , german authorities posted quarantine signs at the entrances , warning of the danger of contagious disease .

  looks like they 're literally using nazi propaganda tactics to me . 
  they are unfit for duty . 
  you know . . for citizens of a country in europe , especially a country that suffered under the holocaust like poland , to accept and shrug at this is just insane to me . 
  edit : no discussion . 
  just downvotes .

  that only works if you both are n't married and do n't have extensive assets and debts together . 
  very much so . 
  it 's an unfortunate situation . 
  i missed a . 
  fixed it . 
  oops . . missed a . 
  thanks . 
  the eu has no obligation to be benevolent to those that are outside it , which is what the u.k. will be . 
  it 's looking out for its own self-interests . . and arguments that it 's not ` wise or benevolent ' really hold no water when you point that out . 
  i think it 's rather wise of them to look out for me , a european citizen . . while minimizing impact of you , a u.k. citizen leaving .
