  did you read the article ? 
   figure 3 hard brexit followed by the uk joining trade agreements with all countries in the world except eu members getting trade agreements with ** all the countries in the world ** would reduce the gdp impact it to 6 % . 
  which is still 1.57 trillion dollars . 
  i 'm sorry . . but that 's just not going to happen . 
  and besides . . trade deals take time to make . . even 2 years in limbo while trade deals are being created will reduce the u.k. to a husk , making future trade deals more and more disadvantageous to the u.k. 
  it 's a loose-loose situation . 
  they 're still in their warm post-brexit coital daze . 
  [ says eu ] ( https://www.google.nl/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-veto-eu-citizens-rights-not-protected-antonio-tajani-says-a7694036.html%3famp ), 
   with the exception , of course , that brussels does n't believe it 's citizens should freely settle across the constituent countries of the uk . 
  uk one country . 
  eu many countries . 
  different situation . 
  you want to settle somewhere else and are not from within the eu ? 
  you deal with that particular countries ' laws . . not the eu 's problem . 
  that 's how freedom of movement works in the eu . . 
  either all in or all out . 
  child benefits however are about who pays tax where . . and those rules are also different per country . 
  which is why the eu wants an over-arching deal . 
  an [ lse study ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/05/22/global-trade-cant-replace-the-value-of-the-eu-single-market-for-the-uk/ ) has shown that a no-deal exit would cost 18 % of british gdp . 
  thats 4.71 trillion u.s dollars . 
  gone . 
  and you 'd be happy with retaining 100 billion pounds in the face of that ? 
  furthermore . . a hard brexit would cost the eu maybe 1 or 2 % but due to the moving of financial passporting , euratom , the ema and other international institutions tied into the ecj would offset that hurt quite a bit . 
  i 'm not too worried for the eu . 
  it 'll muddle on as it always has . 
  britain is slowly sliding towards the cliff-edge , though . . and unless they start being reasonable instead of reactionary in the negotiations and finally start realising that out really does mean out , that 's exactly what is going to happen . 
  edit : and i 'm using dollars for your gdp because the pound is hardly a stable currency , currently . 
  well ... brexit is happening . 
  why would n't the eu look after its own interests ? 
  british people always seem so surprised that the eu has its own self-interests at heart . . and not those of them after they decided to leave . 
  why is that ? 
  then no trade deal . 
  oh come on . . firstly , what have the bailouts got to do with anything ? 
  and secondly , how can you claim incompetence when the eu clearly has a goal , namely protect its own interests and that of its citizens and is doing an actual good job of it ? 
   why should we have to pay for kids born in foreign countries who never even stepped foot here , after brexit has happened ? 
  because the eu would allow the same thing reciprocally . 
  imagine a british engineer who 's working in berlin and wants to apply for child benefits for his children and his wife . 
  does he apply for them in england ? 
  or apply for them in germany , when he 's paying german taxes ? 
  he 's not paying uk tax . . so who pays in the end if you ca n't transfer the child benefits ? 
  it 's a lot more complex than it seems on first glance . . like with anything in the eu . 
  i do n't think that is fair . 
  it 's more like the pot calling the electric kettle black . 
  aaand the russian appologists are out in force again ...  there was no `` soviet invasion of lithuania '' . 
  it was a silent submission as correctly described by an estonian historian . 
  there was no `` soviet collaboration with nazi germany '' . 
  the holocaust was very successful in the baltic states thanks to people like these so-called forest brothers . 
  jewish organizations have critized lithuania for this as well holy shit these people are delusional ... or paid very well to be this delusional . 
  jesus would let someone who has no chance of recovery , is of sound mind and decided enough is enough make that choice for himself . 
  because jesus was n't a dick . 
  it 's addictive . 
  just look at america . 
   you were supposed to save the brew , not ruin it !, 
  i suspect the irish govt ministers will be playing [ the unofficial dutch national anthem ] ( https://youtu.be/ll3uipto-4a ) in their pub tonight . 
  [ they really hate our oranges ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c6twpbexaaauo9x.jpg:large ) . 
  ouch . 
  i guess all those political dinners might have cost him more than he 'd have wanted to . 
  they do n't call them ` political parties ' for nothing . 
  our caravans double as flotation devices . 
  he rolls the ` r ' at the beginning of his show for so long it cost an extra hour to cut . 
  true . 
  dutch people would n't have the words flat and ban in the same sentence . 
  `` if they have money they can come . '', 
  \\ - famous dutch saying, 
  i hear the [ unofficial dutch anthem playing ] ( https://youtu.be/ll3uipto-4a ), 
  or if you 're born with two foreign parents . 
  or if your partner is of a different nationality . 
  then you can choose to have a dual passport . 
  however , this can be challenged by the government . 
   i feel like macron has been maybe too deferential to a president who keeps sticking his mouth and nose in internal eu affairs i kind of agree , but i see the benefits of humoring trump as well . 
  it 's an effective way to convince him of the advantages of dealing with the eu over other ` strongman ' countries like russia and china . 
  the only way to do so is apparently to stroke trump 's ego , so let 's see if we can stroke it until he fires his russian handlers and turns into a true ally of the eu . 
  you know . . 
  i 've lived in many places but there 's always something special about coming home to amsterdam . 
  it 's taken me years to figure out what it is , but i reckon it 's the people . . they 're [ knurd ] ( https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/knurd ) . 
   consider the following scale :  - being drunk is to be intoxicated by alcohol to such an extent as to be unable to perceive the world clearly through the senses . 
   - being sober is to be able to perceive the world clearly through the senses , yet humans are quite capable of giving themselves illusions and little stories to make life more bearable . 
   - being knurd is to be ( un ) intoxicated with amsterdam coffee to such an extent that all such comfort stories are stripped away from the mind . 
   this makes you see the world in a way ` nobody ever should ' , in all its harsh reality .

   passenger rights directive nr 261/2004 . 
  you know the eu is deadly serious if there 's a directive . 
  everybody knows kruppstahl is actually just dutch bikes folded over and over again . 
  indeed . 
  there 's too much money riding on this . 
  [ we are ready . 
  i found some glaring errors in your map . 
  [ here . . 
  i fixed it for you . 
  trump being wrong has never stopped him from claiming he was right . 
  i do n't believe it 's necessarily a serbian problem . 
  every country has its cunts . 
  some hide them better than others . 
  i hope it works out for you guys . 
  i hope you wo n't be screwed over and it will be equitable . 
  unfortunately , studies have shown it wo n't be nearly enough to compensate for the loss of revenue if there 's a hard brexit . 
  it 'd be best for everyone if the u.k. could do both a soft brexit and a good trade deal with the u.s. . . but i have very little faith in your collective ability to do both . . or indeed either .
