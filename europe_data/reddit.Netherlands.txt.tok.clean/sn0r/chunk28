  what surprised me is that it surprises anyone . 
  and we europeans are grateful . 
   small salient fact : we 're doing a lot of lifting when it comes to development aid and soft power diplomacy in places like afghanistan and around the world because we 've spent a lot of money on sustainable development and diplomatic projects around the globe . 
  it does n't cover the difference in nato expenditure . . but it shows we do bring something other than trade to the table when it comes to our ` value ' to the u.s. as a whole . 
  i nominate bielefeld , germany . 
  [ it does n't exist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bielefeld_conspiracy ) , so it ca n't be overpopulated , attacked or invaded . 
  tourists wo n't find it and companies ca n't send lobbyists there . 
  win-win . 
  their . 
  their veto . 
  half of america , apparently . 
  i still do n't get it . 
  we have better healthcare , better quality of life , better internet , better sustainable economies ... 
  it seems like pure projection to me . 
  look at this utter coont , already trying to distance herself from any responsibility . 
  nooo . . it 'll be _ britain 's _ fault . . not hers .

  what 's not to like ? 
  the real queen would [ melt in your mouth , not in your hand ] ( https://youtu.be/8hcd69jgmx0 ) . 
   they are basically ignoring the sovereignty of germany . 
  they 'll do that anyway ; they already violated dutch sovereignty by [ ` invading ' from germany ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/11/erdogan-brands-dutch-nazi-remnants-for-barring-turkish-mp ) . 
  i feel bad for you guys . 
   foolproof that 's never ever gone wrong before . 
  go for it !, 
   that 's an incredibly shallow expression you 've given . 
  it was meant in jest , more than anything . 
  i 'm not really advocating re-invasion of the u.k. either . . do n't worry . 
  ^ ^ i 'll ^ ^ leave ^ ^ that ^ ^ up ^ ^ to ^ ^ the ^ ^ polish ^ ^ this ^ ^ time, 
  remember remember the 5th of november . 
  just do n't remind them that on the same day in 1688 [ the dutch successfully invaded the uk , replaced the monarchy with their own and drafted the bill of rights for them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glorious_revolution ) maybe it 's time to do that again ? 
  as someone married to a brit and having 2 british family members in education and social services i can assure you that the veneer of competence and education in the uk is only a few molecules thick . 
  if you 're poor or even slightly well off , your education and social environment is utter shit . 
  edit : for example , my brother and sister in law both have very well paying jobs and ca n't afford for my cousin to go to a good school . 
  my father in law was disabled in a motorcycle accident and despite having worked all his life ca n't get the home care he and my elderly mother in law need . 
  she 's now his primary caretaker . 
  if she 's in any way incapacitated that household is fucked . 
  there 's many options on the table , but federalism is n't likely to be on the cards as far as merkel , macron , rutte et al are concerned . 
  besides , like i said . . 
  the dutch and the french rejected outright federalism in the referenda in 2005 . 
  which your government allows . . and in the past has encouraged . . so stop trying to put the blame on others . 
  are you kidding ? 
  what is this ? 
  a fucking football game to you ? 
  the eu is a project . 
  does it have problems ? 
  yes . 
  is it worth throwing in the bin ? 
  i support further ** economic ** integration because dutch and i support less bureaucracy because it saves money ( see . . dutch ) . 
  whatever the eu becomes it wo n't be a federal union . 
  the dutch and the french put a stop to that years ago . 
   considering apart from germany , we spend large amounts more than those countries into the eu budget per citizen you pay pretty much on average . 
  https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2016/50/netherlands-largest-net-contributor-eu-this-century us dutchies are paying a lot more than anyone per head . 
  i think having the uk not in the eu will mean a bigger load on germany , france , italy and austria and belgium . . while more demands of progress from the ones receiving aid and having shitty economies . . but we 'll deal without you if we have to . . as it means 60 million less people to supply services to as well . 
   considering immigration was one of the main reasons cameron tried to get a deal , italy and austria and most other european countries do not have the same rates of immigration as the uk does . 
  oh come on . . the uk 's government willingly did n't implement rules made to stop internal immigration within the eu http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/02/brexit-big-lie-uk-could-have-reduced-eu-immigration-by-82-under-eu-rules.html  which emphasises how absurd the concept of a union where all of its members with different situations and issues all have to abide by the same laws , immune from change or reform . 
  but it is n't . 
  the eu is incredibly bureaucratic , but not monolithic . 
  it 's just that in the case of cameron everyone was against him because what the uk demanded was yet another exception to a situation they ~ ~ created ~ ~ helped create themselves . 
  if merkel , macron and a few other of the main contributors want to push the eu in a certain direction , it 's going to happen . 
  it ca n't . 
  the elections in the netherlands and france prove that . 
  the absolute worst of us , maybe . 
  not far right , but number one with the far right . 
  you 've got to admit that brexit was at least in part hijacked by the racists and bigots . 
  i distinctly remember nigel farage standing in front of a ukip sign stating the hordes of immigrants were coming . . 
  which was very reminiscent of nazi propaganda . 
  and then it turns out your government has for years failed to implement the eu laws on eu migrants and used them to suppress wages while bashing the eu citizens actually willing to work for political gain on the far right of the political spectrum . 
  that blew up in their face as the brexit referendum . 
  i mean come on . 
  it 's project hate . . but it 's your side that 's hating . 
  edit : also remember jo cox ? 
  i do . 
  the dutch already said fuck off to wilders . 
  we 've got your backs , mes amis . 
   so i 'm a racist cause i dislike islam ? 
  where did i say that ? 
  i said t-d and alt-right subreddits have been shown to shit on economic migrants and refugees as subhuman . 
  you 're labeling yourself now . 
   it 's not really a wide range of beliefs . 
  take a look at any islamic majority country . 
  how many of them even remotely have basic human rights ? 
  indonesia is doing quite well for itself , despite saudi wahabi encroachment . 
  do they have extremism . . sure they do . 
  is it endemic/essential to islam ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  like i said , a good parable is protestantism . 
  islam is such a wide range of beliefs and dogmas it 's very hard to say what 's what . 
  it 's hard to pin down where people 's beliefs end and their dogmas start as well . 
   i wo n't disagree that the netherlands is doing a decent job . 
  but sweden is n't . 
  france is n't . 
  belgium is n't . 
  and the uk peace 'd out of the whole shitshow and wants no part in it . 
  europe is n't doing so well . 
  sweden 's doing quite well actually . 
  they 've been pretty unfairly portrayed , i think . 
  france has its share of problems . . but look at the fucking size of that place . . every region is different , every part of france has a different culture and a different outlook on their position in the world . 
  you ca n't lump the ban-lieus of paris with lyon or jump on the occasional terror incident to justify that outlook at all , i think . 
  also , do n't forget ; france is battling boko haram , isis and al quaeda around the world , making them a prime target . 
   the far right is rising because of it .
