  you mean like what already happened last year when ukrainian troops were on the verge of cleaning up the rebels and suddenly tanks everywhere ? 
  so does reuters . 
  i 've been building an application which takes different news sources and compares their use of positively charged terms vs negative use of terms ( like stories about war vs stories about science - note a very simplistic example ) as well as if they are pro/anti business interests , which ones , etc. 
  so far the times , reuters and newsweek definitely are the more conservative leaning , meaning they 'll support status quo articles at a higher percentage than other news sources like cnn , the bbc or fox etc. 
  note that this is based on a years worth of article titles ( not articles themselves ) and i 'm still working on the algorithm so i may be wrong . . though i do n't think so . 
  do n't forget the endemic corruption !, 
  if you did , i 'm sure it would involve bacon and lego somehow . 
  i do n't want to leave the e.u. 
  i want _ you _ to leave the e.u. 
  amsterdam is ready and willing . 
  especially the face sitting . 
  we 've got specialists for that . 
  lets be honest here ; a vast majority of the u.k. does n't give a shit . 
  ` must ` nt grumble ' , ` well _ i _ have nothing to hide ' and ' i did n't vote for them ' are the rallying cries of the apathetic in britain . 
  we 're better off without the uk . 
  this a thousand times over . 
  we do n't need a torture-enabling , human-rights-violating privacy-undermining authoritarian state trying to piss into our soup . 
  the u.k. is better off on its own and we 'll be better of for it too . 
  which is why i , for one , will be glad to see them gtfo from the eu . 
  we do n't need our countries to turn into authoritarian shit-states like the u.k. 
  false equivalences . 
  here 's an article from [ today 's nytimes ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/world/europe/portugal-clears-the-way-for-extradition-of-ex-cia-agent-to-italy.html?smid=re-share&amp;_r=0&amp;referer= ) . 
  you 're comparing apples with oranges . 
  sure we all spy on each other , but it takes a special kind of fucked up to kidnap , torture and assassinate people in your allies ' countries . 
  this is why i think the eu and britain are fundamentally incompatible . 
  we value our rights of our citizns ever so slightly more than either the uk or the us do . 
  that 's not saying that we do n't spy on eachother or do n't share in the five-eyes bullshit , but the fact remains that when it comes to attitudes about fundamental rights the us and the uk like to play fast and loose .
