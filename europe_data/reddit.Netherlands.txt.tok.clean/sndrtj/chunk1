in the south , _ pruis _ / _ pruus _ is also sometimes used as a milder slur for germans . 
  netherlands : giving a small token ( 1-2 euro ) tip is not awkward , but only if the service was good . 
  you are not expected to tip by definition , and workers get paid a regular salary . 
  if the service was good , i usually round up to a nice number . 
  `` that was 13.50 , please '' --  `` just make it 15 '' . 
  i forgot about that one , but as i recall it 's a bit of a flop , is n't it ? 
  we actually have quite many . 
  most obviously : * [ almere ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/almere ) . 
  incorporated in 1984 , it 's completely planned , on our newest part of reclaimed sea , and is currently home to nearly 200,000 people . 
  while not the prettiest of cities , it 's still growing fast with property still affordable for middle class earners . 
  incorporated in 1980 , it 's the capital of flevoland , but it never really took off like almere did . 
  pop 75k . 
  tiny village turned into the hague 's backyard in the 1960s , with a current population of about 120k . 
  then there are several small towns that have were designated as `` growth cores '' during the deurbanization of the 1960s and 1970s . 
  usually they still have a tiny old core , but nearly all of it consists of post-1960 residences . 
  many examples , e.g. 
  garden _ towns _ as such are uncommon/nonexistent , but [ garden _ districts _ ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuindorp_\\ ( wijk \\ ) #nederland ) were popular in the 19th century . 
  those days they 've been gobbled up by their host cities , and are n't as green as the name would make one believe . 
  * there are some roman ruins underneath hotel derlon in the center of maastricht . 
  the hotel 's bar is located amids them , it 's kinda funky . 
  it was closed in 1992 , and is now open for public . 
  * the hague has several nazi bunkers from wwii open for public . 
  * if you 're in the hague , go cycling in the dunes . 
  they 're beautiful . 
  did a while in germany ( have since returned ) , but here were my annoyances * no , i do not own a camper . 
  i do n't like camping . 
  * no , i do n't smoke weed . 
  most of us are actually pretty conservative . 
  * i know , you find all our diminutives cute , and yes we use ` lekker ' as an adjective for about anything , not just food . 
  it 's not crazy . 
  did you learn anything of the local dialect ? 
  it is . 
  ` makom ' just means city . 
  actually , the nickname used to be `` mokum aleph '' , aka `` city a '' . 
  rotterdam was called ` mokum resh ' , aka ` city r ' . 
  you 'd expect the catholic church to have invented some tastier bread after 1600 years of experience . 
  but no , still this ghastly thin wafer that somehow always manages to stick to the roof of your mouth . 
  ah . . so you crossed the border at the bosscherweg ? 
  and you lived in veltwezelt ? 
  on average ? 
  10-20x a year ? 
  used to be more , since i grew up near a border , and hopping into belgium for various reasons was a more than weekly thing . 
  netherlands would be very dense , but no mountains whatsoever . 
  berlin itself is an island in a sea of nothingness , by european population density standards . 
  $ 2.50 for 0.3 l is the norm here . 
  less frequent than in english . 
  ` het ' is usually shortened to _ ` t _ in spoken language . 
  same happens with ` een ' , which becomes _ ` n _ . 
  however , these are rarely written down . 
  ` dat is ' occasionally becomes _ da 's _ . 
  i think the proper word in english for gezin is * nuclear family * . 
  * vrachtwagenbandventieldopjessleutelhangerdragerringetje * hmm ... ca n't get very far in dutch . . 
  yes , * wel * is used to emphasize something . 
  `` hij heeft het wel gedaan '' could be translated as '' [ but ] he * did * [ indeed ] do it '' . 
  i have my suspicions that geenstijl is funded/promoted by russia , but that 's about it . 
  in berlin i know there is one . 
  here ? 
  never really seen something particularly marketed as `` american style '' , but burgers and other junk food can essentially be bought everywhere . 
  biomedical sciences , tho the first two year of my bachelor 's largely overlapped with chemistry and chemical engineering . 
  very small . 
  the monarchy is widely loved , even though republicanism has seen a small increase since the coronation of the current king . 
  there 's only one [ serious republican organization ] ( http://www.republikeinen.nl/ ) , and no mainstream political party is in favor of abolishment . 
  i have several thousands worth of study books in my bookshelf . 
  especially during my bachelor they were absolutely necessary . 
  costs were about $ 500 - $ 1000 per year . 
  during my master 's i think i only bought for $ 250 on books . 
  we use red asphalt for all bike lanes . 
  makes it impossible to miss or forget . 
  * no , we do n't all smoke weed . 
  in fact , we have a low rate of substance abuse . 
  * realize you ca n't properly bike . 
  * `` how are you ? '', 
  will be answered with either a frown or with an actual answer . 
  * do n't expect random strangers to talk to you . 
  you might get a greeting on the countryside , but in urban areas no one will even notice you exist . 
  * if you intend to use public transport more than once : buy an [ ov chip card ] ( https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/apply-1/anonymous-ov-chipkaart.htm ) . 
  they cost $ 7.50 , but very quickly pay themselves back . 
  trip price goes by km , and local public transport often costs less than half the full single ticket prize . 
  as an added bonus , they 're valid across all public transport in the entire country . 
  * do n't forget to check out !, 
  why are they not colored ? 
  i 'd like to get rid of ours . 
  us being in a monarchy is a historical oddity , since we became independent as the first modern republic . 
  the netherlands has also been bombing is . 
  the drug runners were an entirely different problem . 
  those were people who would drive you into a corner , and force you to buy cocaine . 
  not weed . 
  cocaine . 
  furthermore , most of these drug runners hailed from the randstad , and the only reason they were in limburg was because they 'd very quickly be in belgium and germany . 
  since a few years we have a treaty with belgium that allows our police from operating in belgian territory , and that essentially killed the business model of the drug runners . 
  the not-selling-weed-to-foreigners policy , in fact , created a problem that was n't there : we now have street dealers again . 
  source : raised in maastricht . 
  in nl , it 's the same drizzle , just more often . 
  and our spineless government will still refuse to accuse russia of anything . 
  they might have stopped . 
  but if there is n't a clear message that this kind of behavior is not allowed , it does set a precedent . 
  other groups might then implement their own sharia police . 
  i do n't think we actually have any print magazines , but online [ de speld ] ( http://speld.nl/ ) , [ luckytv ] ( http://www.luckymedia.nl/luckytv/ ) and [ geenstijl ] ( https://www.geenstijl.nl/ ) , though that last one is more sarcastic than satirical . 
  in my experience as a tourist in japan , it 's * way * safer than any western city . 
  one of my travel companions left her iphone on a bench in a public park ; the next day it was still there untouched .
