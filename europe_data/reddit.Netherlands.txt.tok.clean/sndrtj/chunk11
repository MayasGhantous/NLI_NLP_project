  which is why there is a massive amount of regulation . 
  keep going dowm , pound !, 
  in a short while , going to london might actually become cheap !, 
  the article is rather alarmist , but somewhat unwarranted . 
  what 's actually happening is just a bit of cultural forcing . 
  the dutch branch of ing has just 244 branch offices , for 8.3 million customers . 
  dutch banking culture already is massively digital , with nearly everything being done online . 
  on the other hand , it still has over 1200 offices in belgium . 
  belgian banking culture has n't digitalized as much as dutch banking culture yet , and ing now sort of wants to force that happening by closing about half of its offices in belgium . 
  from a business point of view , it all makes sense . 
  the overhead ing has in belgium will definitely be higher than it has in the netherlands , and it makes sense to try to minimize that . 
  both , but primarily the former . 
  the dutch language does n't know dental fricatives . 
  voiceless dental fricatives ( as in `` thing '' ) often become something akin to ` f ' with dutch speakers . 
  these days the former is n't pronounced like ` zh ' anymore , but like 'd ' . 
  so this -  dis . 
  the dutch language also devoices consonants at the end of words or syllables , even when the written language still writes voiced consonants . 
  that means `` bet '' and `` bed '' are pronounced identical . 
  the telegraaf is the most sensationalist of them all here . 
  i 'm seriously starting to think poe 's law is at work here . 
  and again / r/europe is devolving into a shouting war between the various ethnic groups in bosnia . 
  sad . 
   how likely is it that i can communicate with a person i grab on the street ? 
  if under 55 years of age , nearly 100 % for basic communication . 
  above that , your mileage may vary . 
  especially women of that generation often did n't have english in school . 
   how many are able to watch english tv unhindered since nothing is dubbed here , i would suspect that number is above 50 % . 
   how is the difference between the low - and high-educated ? 
  the english of those lower educated is often limited to small talk , with a huge accent , and a lot of [ dunglish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunglish ) thrown in . 
  for higher education a decent level of english is simple necessity , with over 50 % of all master programs being held in english only . 
  this also translates to the job market ; english is more often a requirement than not . 
   how big is the discrepancy between age groups ? 
  the only generation to generally lack english skills is the elderly . 
  especially women , since they often did n't have any higher education . 
  generally , the younger the better the level of english . 
  the english taught by schools also seems to have changed over the years . 
  older people will generally pronounce `` th '' as `` zhe '' ( this seems to have been required in high school in their times ) , and those of 40 and older very often still pronounce ` u ` as if it were in dutch ( i.e. 
  pronouncing ` bus ' like it is ` b\u00f6ss ' ) , and often ` o ` as well ( i.e. 
  ` done ' becoming 'd \u00f6nn ' ) . 
  i do still feel a lot of non-local news are you are describing there gets removed , like items that are relevant to at least two countries . 
  euronews kinda sucks . 
  it 's like regurgitation of other channels , and produces very little , if any , on its own . 
  why do n't we start one , take matters into our own hands ? 
  translation of the article :  ** the amsterdammer press photographer jeroen oerlemans ( 46 ) has been killed in the libyan city of sirte on sunday . 
  **  he was shot dead by snipers connected to the libyan branch of is . 
  he was brought to a hospital , but doctors could no longer help him . 
   oerlemans was making a report for belgian weekly knack . 
  `` the news was reported to us by journalist joanie de rijke , employee of knack . 
  she was making a report in libya together with oerlemans '' , knack [ writes ] ( http://m.knack.be/nieuws/mensen/fotograaf-jeroen-oerlemans-doodgeschoten-in-libie/article-normal-759503.html ) on its website . 
   according to de rijke oerlemans wore a bullet-free vest and a helmet , but the bullet hit his heart through his side , which killed him immediately . 
   ** passionate **  the ministry of foreign affairs [ confirmed ] ( https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2016/10/02/fotograaf-jeroen-oerlemans-overleden ) the death of oerlemans . 
  his family has been notified . 
  minister koenders : `` oerlemans is a journalist who kept on going where others stopped . 
  passionate to capture the news on the black screen in the conflict zones of the world . 
  i am deeply saddened he paid the highest price for his work . 
  i wish his partner , children , and family a lot of strength with this great loss . 
  a great photographer has passed . '', 
   in the libyan coastal city of sirte heavy fighting has gone for months between troops loyal to the libyan government and fighters of is . 
   ** kidnapped **  in july 2012 oerlemans was [ kidnapped ] ( http://www.parool.nl/binnenland/verdachten-ontvoering-oerlemans-gaan-vrijuit~a3542948/ ) in the north of syria together with british photographer john cantlie . 
  after a a week they were freed by combatants of the free syrian army . 
   oerlemans received the zilveren camera in 2010 and 2011 . 
  the past few years he was active in afghanistan , libya and syria , amongst other places . 
  it 's called democracy . 
  sometimes that means you loose . 
  or this [ annoyance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwq-t2crjru ) with its thick dutch accent . 
  wtf ? 
  that chicken imitation !, 
  that 's a rich-folks thing and not exactly popular in the generation born after 1990 . 
  the immediate assumption that we all smoke weed . 
  it 's very useful to raise your prestige . 
  i used it a lot on an extended timeline run with rome , where i got a lot of prestige hits by ceding provinces to one of my vassals so i could form a vassal-ring around the barbarians . 
  a few small microstates in africa would keep insulting me every other year . 
  this should be higher up . 
  would have prevented that entire clusterfuck moving out of the arabian peninsula a few years later . 
  ok , in a shared system like that , it might indeed make some sense . 
  in a system where everyone has their own mini-system , that point 'd be mute . 
  then why is the heating system not on anyway ? 
  sounds ... weird . 
  that said , if everyone pays a fixed amount to the landlord , i can imagine why the landlord would like to curtail use in the summer months , since there 'll always those people who will take advantage of the system and have the heating on 24/7 . 
  any link on that ? 
  and how do you get your warm water then ? 
  that 's also building-wide ? 
  because the common system over here is a combined unit that does both tap water and central heating ( for every single unit ) . 
  if you need two systems , that sounds quite inefficient to me . 
  can you balkan guys just get your act together ? 
  it 's 2016 , for christ 's sake . 
  endlessly blaming the other party will not solve anything ; two wrongs does n't equal a right . 
  where in europe does the owner of an apartment decide that ? 
  i rent in a housing block , and every * single apartment * has its own central heating system that 's up to each and every tenant to decide when they switch on . 
  i pay directly to the energy company , the landlord only pays for the maintenance of the machine . 
  that 's essentially how it 's done here . 
  i have a central heating system that heats both my tap water and heats the water in the radiator system . 
  there 's no central heating system that you can switch on ? 
  pragmatism is evidently not something inherent in your cultures , so it seems . 
  [ limburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limburg_\\ ( netherlands \\ ) ), 
  oh god , please , not that disaster all over again . 
  honest question : why is secession seen as something that would lead to another war ? 
  as i understand it , bosnia currently is not exactly a functional country because of the ethnic divide . 
  secession would create ( more ) homogeneous countries , which should , at least theoretically , function better . 
  at least you catalans usually are so nice as to * not * use that weird upside-down exclamation mark .
