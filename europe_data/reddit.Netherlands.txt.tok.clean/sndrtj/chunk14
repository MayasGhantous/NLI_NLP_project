  after eurovision , why not join the eu ? 
  this does n't actually tell me * how * the centre is calculated . 
  besides ... the centre of gravity of a massless material ; does that make any sense ? 
  assuming it 's stationary . 
  i 'm kinda amazed that unicode encodes arabic calligraphy tho . 
  good luck fighting freedom of expression ( no matter how tasteless ) : /, 
  not sure if sarcasm , but germans do indeed have issues with teenagers not working . 
  it 's not culturally accepted for teenagers and students to work on a regular basis . 
  that 's got to hurt their ability to be financially independent at a later age . 
  this . 
  i 've felt `` poor '' in countries where my income was literally double the average there , but everyone around me was flinging their credit card at everything , something that ai n't a possibility for me . 
  at least socially , poverty is n't about the absolute number of euros one earns , but more about not being able to spend as much as the average person . 
  ** netherlands ** dutch news is still largely dominated by the fallout of the failed coup in turkey . 
  this is technically allowed , as long as the children can immediately start at another school . 
  considering the relatively huge amount of school-switchers , that 's not always guaranteed . 
  * prime minister rutte gave a [ 3-hour interview ] ( http://www.vpro.nl/zomergasten/kijk/afleveringen/2016/mark-rutte.html ) last sunday evening . 
  responding to a question regarding [ attacks on dutch news crews ] ( http://nos.nl/video/2117905-nos-ploeg-belaagd-in-rotterdam.html ) during a turkish protest in rotterdam following the coup , he said something along the lines of '' [ bugger off ; go back to turkey ] ( http://nos.nl/video/2129935-rutte-over-turkse-jongeren-in-zomergasten.html ) '' . 
  * even considering the above , the government decided to [ extent ] ( https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2016/09/09/missie-in-irak-verlengd-en-schip-voor-training-libische-kustwacht ) the military training mission of iraqi and peshmerga troops in iraq until 2017 - this time closer to is territory . 
  the dutch navy will also send a ship to libyan waters , ostensibly to train libyan coast guards . 
  * with just half a year to go to general elections , it seems the [ pvv ] ( http://www.parool.nl/binnenland/vvd-loopt-verder-in-op-pvv-in-peiling~a4374517/ ) is starting to drop in in the polls in favor of the vvd . 
  * political/shock blog geenstijl [ loses ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-08/playboy-wins-top-eu-court-fight-over-web-photo-copyrights ) a case against playboy-publisher sanoma in a copyright case in front of eu courts . 
  this has potentially [ huge consequences ] ( https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/european-copyright-ruling-ushers-new-dark-era-hyperlinks ) for the european internet . 
  * the problem kids surrounding troubles in the poelenburg district of zaandam ( near amsterdam ) were [ invited ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnb9jjzleaw ) to a popular talk show . 
  as might be expected , they behaved like total brats , and elicited some responses from the political class . 
  * dutch jihadist and former member of the dutch army israfil yilmaz was [ killed ] ( http://dutchturks.nl/nederlandse-ex-militair-yilmaz-mogelijk-gedood-bij-luchtaanval-op-raqqa/ ) . 
  he gave an [ ama ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/3ulkob/islamic_state_isisisilis_fighter_taking_questions/ ) , and was possibly killed while giving a [ second ama ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/51mlhn/isis_fighter_uchechclear_is_killed_by_an_air/ ) . 
  * minor political squabble after a member of the denk party ( turkish interests , and known for bullying mps ) [ refuses to shake hands ] ( http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/26557020/__kuzu_geeft_premier_israel_geen_hand__.html ) with netanyahu during the israeli prime minister 's visit to the dutch parliament . 
  ** limburg ** * ( 2 weeks ago ) . 
  geenstijl [ lost ] ( http://www.nu.nl/media/4314843/powned-moet-onno-hoes-schadevergoeding-betalen.html ) another court case , this time surrounding the former mayor of maastricht . 
  back in 2014 , the mayor - onno hoes - went on a date with a 28 year younger man . 
  this turned out to have been orchestrated by geenstijl , who supplied the guy with a hidden camera . 
  they recorded the two having some overt sexual conversations . 
  the airing of that contributed to mr hoes stepping down as mayor of maastricht . 
  the court now ruled that while the recordings were allowed to have been made , geenstijl was not allowed to * air * them . 
  geenstijl has to pay onno hoes an as-of-yet-unspecified amount of money , and has to delete the videos from its website . 
  * beloved kebab-imperium musti of maastricht was [ saved ] ( http://www.1limburg.nl/bekende-maastrichtse-donerwagen-musti-terug?context=default ) , after suddenly declaring bankruptcy last month . 
  visitors of maastricht railway station can now have kebab again . 
  then what are the smaller areas ? 
  probably these are municipalities ? 
  how can they be so quick with saying anything about the cause of the accident ? 
  in english ? 
   were published by geenstijl that 's not true . 
  geenstijl did n't * publish * them . 
  it * linked * to the leak . 
  that the leak itself was illegal , is a no-brainer to anyone . 
  but just * linking * to something is another matter altogether . 
  judging by the looks of it , this could have been much worse . 
  that front carriage is totally destroyed . 
   we gained our independence less than 200 years ago that 's a bit of a non-argument . 
  most countries in europe did . 
  even germany , in its current form , is only 25 years old , and before 1871 even the concept of a german state did n't exist . 
  this makes sense . 
  usability is something very subjective . 
  we all very often buy stuff that has features we do n't like or use . 
  my sound system has a cd drive , that i 've never used . 
  my laundry machine comes with 20 different pre-programmed settings , of which i 'll only use 3 . 
  in a nutshell ; they made $ 118 million profit after tax in 2015 , and $ 180 million profit after tax in 2014 . 
  revenues went up in 2015 by 20 % compared to 2014 ( mostly due new concessions/acquisitions ) . 
  the higher profit in 2014 was mostly caused by incidental financial advantages ( minus these the profit would have been [ $ 78 million ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/02/12/ns-boekt-winst-door-eenmalige-meevallers-onvoldoende-a1418722 ) that year ) . 
  the first half a year of this year looks even [ better ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/08/19/hogere-winst-en-meer-treinen-op-tijd-voor-ns-a1516987 ) ; revenue went up 9 % , and profits went up from $ 56 million to $ 69 million . 
  yes . 
  and db is so ridiculously * expensive * . 
  per kilometer it 's literally 200-300 % of the price as in the netherlands . 
  der spiegel is usually well-informed . 
  it 's not the most unreliable medium ever . 
  so germany capitulates to erdowahn, 
  the us calling things done by a foreign power `` unfair '' ? 
  oh , the irony !, 
  that statue is so weird . 
  it 's like they could n't decide whether he should be naked or clothed , and in stead decided to make it a see-through cloth . 
  same price as here . 
  so what 's the problem ? 
  that 's technically not entirely true , although practically it of course is . 
  from a legal pov : `` anyone who shows up '' will get a place * while their asylum application is pending * . 
  most non-syrians can easily be denied asylum legally , but that requires processing their applications first . 
  by the time the german bureaucracy ( not the fastest in the world ) has processed the million + requests , many will have inevitably disappeared into the margins of society . 
  being an observant muslim means promoting the religion . 
  that 's their religious duty . 
  moabit is n't that bad , although it get worse the closer you get to wedding :p . 
  dear holy crap , i never realized the earth can shake at more than half a * g * during an earthquake . 
  they 're very uncommon in non-mediterranean european countries too . 
  if only greece does n't make the some mistake western europe did : let saudi 's fund it . 
  i ca n't vouch for all of europe ; it is likely different in all countries . 
  as for holland : it 's pretty much the exact opposite from the us . 
  credit scores do n't exist . 
  there is , however , a [ national registration database ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/bureau_krediet_registratie ) of the * existence * of personal loans ( or other financial obligations ) . 
  just having any record there works against you . 
  having * any * loans considerably limits you in acquiring other loans . 
  in fact , someone who 's never had any loan is far more likely to get a loan than someone 's who 's had many ( even if they were all paid entirely on time ) . 
  have a car loan ? 
  forget about that mortgage . 
  that 's the complete opposite from the us , where you have to build up a credit score . 
  but afaik , any corporate loans from a limited liability company you own do n't affect that registration in any manner . 
  going under probably does affect your ability to acquire * corporate * loans , but should n't affect personal loans . 
  that said , the stigma on going under is quite bad here compared to the states . 
  the lax attitudes towards going under in the states are actually touted as one thing we should try to import ;-) . 
  all the above is related to two things : calvinism and language . 
  dutch culture is essentially calvinist , even though it removed the religious aspects . 
  that means rather frugal and no elaborate shows of wealth . 
  as for the language : the dutch word for debt ( * schuld * ) actually means * guilt * when literally translated .
