  a large contingent of vehicles we still have are therefore effectively useless . 
  is there a link that doesnt require flash as well ? 
  translation of article :  army can no longer defend own territory  soldiers are insufficiently trained `` to execute all possible missions in the violence spectrum '' , minister hennis says . 
   the army can no longer fullfill its most fundamental goal : the defense of own and allied territory . 
  minister jeanine hennis ( dept. 
  of defense , vvd ) writes this on wednesday in the frame of accountability day to parliament . 
  she has had to `` conclude that the military does not fully satisfy this capability goal '' . 
  the military has had a lack of spare parts for years , and solders are insufficiently trained `` to execute all possible missions in the violence spectrum '' . 
  the problems occur in all four sectors of the military : the land force , air force , navy and marechaussee [ military police/border police ] . 
   the problems at the military are of a structural nature . 
  the court of audit writes today in its accountability study that `` the maintenance process [ for vehicles ] has not been sufficient since several years '' and that this `` has very negative consequences for the operational preparedness '' of the armed forces . 
  but it is for the first time that the department of defense itself acknowledges that it can no satisfy its most elementary requirement . 
   in the operational capability report of last september , hennis still wrote that only other goals could no longer be met . 
  now she writes that the defective training `` in combination with high expectations from nato '' lead to the defense of own territory being under pressure . 
  hello iberian soulmate !, 
   most children from islamic families seem to lack respect for anyone not islamic this reminds me of a discussion recently on fb . 
  some newspaper ( i believe nrc ) had an article about the lack of dutch workers in migrant-owned businesses . 
  the level of outright racism and hatred against native dutch in the comment section was astounding . 
  the mildest comment was that `` all dutch are * mierenneukers * ( ant fuckers ; nitpickers ) , and therefore unemployable '' . 
  this is one of the reasons why i would n't want to raise a kid in the randstad . 
  we always laughed at the fact that limburgish school always rank at the top of any ratings . 
  `` if this is good , how bad is the worst ? '' . 
  but now i live in the randstad the kids actually scare me . 
  zero respect for teachers and authority , levels of bullying that seem absurd , the islamic pack/herd mentality , and a general disdain for education . 
  i 'd like to claim castile . 
  while i see your point , i 'm actually in favor of ever stricter tobacco laws . 
  the reason is that tobacco does n't just harm the smoker . 
  if it only were harmful to the smoker , yes then it 'd be a completely personal choice . 
  but cigarette is considerably harmful to bystanders as well . 
  the smoker is taking away the bystander 's choice of living a healthy life . 
  especially considering children , who might not know or realize the implications of being near smokers . 
  they already regulate soda , in some manner . 
  there 's a hidden excise tax on soda barely anyone knows about . 
   they taste like crap because , you know , tobacco * is * crap . 
  the thing with smoking is that even minute quantities are damaging . 
  alcohol , in and by itself , is something the body can at least cope with . 
  heck , it is a byproduct of our own metabolism at times . 
  alcohol only becomes damaging past a certain threshold , whereas even a single cigarette is harmful . 
  there is no such thing as a concept of early retirement anymore in nl . 
  it 's 67 + for everyone . 
  and by + i mean that the legal retirement age is now coupled to average life span . 
  for our generation the legal retirement age is probably closer to 75 . 
  ah , good point !, 
  true , i 'll grant you that , but it would be extremely rare ( and therefore unlikely ) something catastrophic happened at an altitude of 11km . 
  even if both engines were to simultaneously fail , the plane should have had another 20 minutes or so to glide down ( and hopefully land ) . 
  considering there was another plane bombing in egypt a while ago , it would n't be too absurd to come to the same conclusion . 
  probably the latter in that case . 
  it 's an a320 , not a type of plane known to spontaneously disintegrate . 
  that leaves the very hard question : how on earth did a bomb get on board a plane that left from charles de gaulle ? 
  how can there be eyewitness reports from an area of the mediterranean where there are no islands ? 
  the idea of a rechtsstaat is that the judiciary is independent . 
  mandatory sentencing takes away the independence on one side of the spectrum , by only allowing the judge to make their judgement towards a higher sentence than they might feel is necessary . 
  furthermore , perhaps the most central tenet of a rechtstaat is that the state should be * just * . 
  that 's a moral judgement , one that can probably never be truly codified into law . 
  omg , that 's just hilarious !, 
  i 'm still skeptical . 
  i would like to hear the final verdict on this ( pun intended ;-) ) . 
  i can understand that a sentence of nothing can * legally * amount to a sentence , but i have a hard time believing there 's an actual minimum amount that has to be served or paid . 
  if you could try to find out what , if any , minimum sentence there is for insults/slander , thanks :-) . 
  wikipedia tells me germany does have mandatory sentences for certain verdicts that result in [ life in prison ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/life_imprisonment_in_germany#life_imprisonment:_mandatory_sentence_for ) , so that does give your claim at least some credence . 
  the reason why i 'm skeptical is because the concept of mandatory sentencing is a highly contentious issue over here . 
  we do n't have it , as of yet ( see the article above about the marijuana case . 
  although successfully appealed by the prosecution , the original sentence was zilch ) . 
  this government wanted to push it through , but the [ proposal ] ( https://www.eerstekamer.nl/wetsvoorstel/33151_minimumstraffen_voor ) was repealed before it was even put up to a vote . 
  and even then it was only for serious criminal acts ( murder , rape etc ) , not insults or slander . 
  human rights groups - including judges themselves - are fiercely opposed . 
  given that our concept of * rechtsstaat * is directly borrowed from the german concept , i 'd be surprised if germany has mandatory sentencing . 
  so you 're saying that germany has ~ ~ minimum punishments ~ ~ [ mandatory sentencing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mandatory_sentencing ) ? 
  as i 'm reading that comment , you are only stating that only in very rare cases the verdict can be ` downgraded ' , but what about the sentence ? 
  ca n't a judge rule `` yes , you 're guilty of x , but your punishment is 0 days in prison and 0 euro fine '' ? 
  edit : found the proper english word . 
  they absolutely can . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2015/09/idealistic-marijuana-growers-get-suspended-jail-terms/ ) . 
  court ruling :  although they were guilty of running an illegal plantation , they should not face punishment , the court said . 
  [ ... ] ` the fact that a blind eye is turned to the sale of soft drugs through coffee shops implies that coffee shops are supplied and that the marijuana has to be grown , ' the court said . 
  the official policy , the court continued , ` does not address how this should happen ' . 
  tl ; dr court said `` your laws do n't make any sense '' to the government . 
  sure , that was another european country than germany , but i 'm sure similar cases can be found in germany as well . 
  for families : home-prepared cheese rolls in plastic bags . 
  add a few store-bought raisin buns as well , for the kids . 
  for students : bags of chips , wine and beer . 
  judges can and do make judgements about the sanity of laws ( hence why they 're * judges * and not robots ) . 
  they can for instance choose to rule someone guilty , but not impose any punishment . 
  in dutch , capitalizations essentially happen only for proper names , and the adjectives thereof ( so : * john * -  * john 's * , * londen * --  * londens ( e ) * , * nederland * -  * nederlands ( e * ) , but * man * -  * mannelijk * ) . 
  demonyms are capitalized , but names ( and adjectives ) of religions are not . 
  therefore , one can write * het joodse volk * ( the jewish people ) and * het joodse geloof * ( the jewish faith ) in the same sentence . 
  in some older texts , one might still spot the occasional capitalized * u * ( formal * you * ) , but that looks really archaic these days . 
  i think it actually makes sentences look really ulgy and confusing . 
  actually the best song of the entire competition !, 
  there are several issues with the pictures you 're posting . 
  1 ) the first picture only lists crime for a * very * specific case . 
  it does not say anything at all about the larger picture 2 ) the second picture is a prime example of cherry-picking . 
  it is absolutely meaningless without mentioning the relative size of the polish community . 
  if 90 % of central and eastern european migrants are polish , the picture would imply that poles are actually * less * criminal than the others . 
  and then it even only selects a few cities . 
  now for the * real * [ data ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=81959ned&amp;d1=2&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=a&amp;d5=0&amp;d6=l&amp;vw=t ) , directly from the bureau of statistics . 
  poles have a crime rate about 200 % that of native dutch . 
  high , sure , but nothing compared to that of muslim communities . 
  moroccans have a crime rate that 's more than 500 % of native dutch . 
  if they take the average of all countries , that 'd be very good for me !,
