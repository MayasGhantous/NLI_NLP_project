  base 12 _ and _ base 20 at the same time , with an extra base 4 thrown in the mix for shits and giggles ?? 
  what were you guys smoking ? 
  the russian flag is [ derived ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_russia#origin ) from the dutch flag . 
  after much hassle , the first tram in nearly 80 years will ride in 2020 when ( hopefully ) the line hasselt-maastricht becomes operational . 
  any clue when lines 16 and 1 in the hague get the new avenio 's ? 
  i love their super-wide doors . 
  why was the old town relatively far removed from the river ? 
  we should reunite xd, 
  gon na be a problem for italian dutchies . 
  yes , boxes on anime without import tax would be nice !, 
  `` pre-decimal currency '' what ? 
  belgium just stole our old motto . 
  understatement of the day . 
  this happens to a lot of expats . 
  any and all problems they encounter are viewed as something inherently bad about the host country . 
  to all future expats ( been one myself ) : you _ will _ encounter conceptual issues with bureaucracy . 
  no , the concepts you learned at home can not be applied to your adoptive country . 
  you will have to learn an entire new set of vocabulary . 
  if you do not speak the language of the host country , you will face extra problems . 
  why would it make commerce more effective ? 
  no wonder the tabloids are what they are , when they cost as little as 10p . 
  ca n't hire actual journalists for that money . 
   7 % of that 10 % belongs to action and wibra alone . 
  do you have any links backing up that claim ? 
  [ this ] ( https://fd.nl/frontpage/ondernemen/898707/wibra-ziet-omzet-en-winst-teruglopen ) article gives wibra a turnover of $ 231m in 2013 , and this [ article ] ( http://www.nu.nl/economie/4246679/wederom-forse-omzetgroei-winkelketen-action.html ) gives action a turnover of $ 1.95 b in 2015 . 
  you initially claimed our retail about 80b of our gdp is retail ( which may be true , i do n't know ) , but 1.95 b + 231m is only about 2.7 % of that entire amount , and _ definitely _ not 70 % . 
  ** celestial empire of china ( also known as ming ) ** the two decades from 1500 to 1520 will forever be known to chinese historians as the great consolidation . 
  border gore in our northern and western edges was removed , with an ever decreasing amount of hordes . 
  in the south , indochina was further divided between china and bengal . 
  unsettling news of a new power crossing the far mountains to the west has reached the forbidden city , though . 
  uncertain clouds seem to be forming above the great gilded chinese cities , and how long the pax sina will hold is unknown . 
   makes sense that they would do that . 
  for starters ( points to self ) it 's crap . 
  at this point , buying a house with an average income is getting really difficult . 
  getting a mortgage has become more difficult , but prices have n't come down enough - in fact , they ' re already growing by double-digit numbers in certain areas . 
  i would say the assassinations of both fortuyn and theo van gogh were pretty major from a total-effect pov , even though they only constitute a single individual . 
  those still reverberate throughout our political landscape . 
  it also lacks the 2011 [ alphen aan den rijn mall shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alphen_aan_den_rijn_shopping_mall_shooting ) , which killed 7 . 
  r is a vowel ? 
  can we collectively file a police report for receiving threats ? 
  that [ article ] ( http://nos.nl/l/2164388 ) was published at 8:32 am today , which is about 10 hours after i wrote that comment . 
  it 's interesting this has n't been in the news here ( only that he was the target of bomb letter ) . 
  says something about our state media . 
  so that is likely extremely skewed . 
  who the hell uses a third party booking platform for domestic trips ? 
  those numbers do n't look realistic . 
  they also do n't mention any sources . 
  what is this based on ? 
  domestic tickets ? 
  international tickets ? 
  but even so , altijd vrij is cheaper than having a car and using it every day . 
  yes , once you have _ multiple _ people , a car becomes cheaper . 
  for a single individual , the train is cheaper . 
  ** heavenly empire of china ( also known as ming ) ** last session our waters were tested by a petty war against japan . 
  this was obviously merely a poke , a power test . 
  more had to be happening across the asian world . 
  schemes and ploys were developed , plans made . 
  and yet , yet , all to no avail . 
  envoys from afar and near reached the forbidden city to tell the emperor about the treacherous plans of the chinese neighbours . 
  furious , he sent out his best negotiating teams . 
  in the deepest secrets , counter-plans were forged . 
  by the time the inglorious alliance of thieves and eunuchs engaged our lands , the territorial integrity of ming seemed more than stable . 
  ming was , ever so briefly , attacked from three sides . 
  the kutai-malaccan war against majapahit was the first to drag me into war , followed by the bengali invasion , and lastly the indochinese invasion who had allied themselves with the filthy japanese . 
  unbeknownst to the treacherous indochinese , agreements had been made with kutai and bengal . 
  for a fair land swap , the aforementioned nations switched sides , leaving only dai viet and japan opposed to the ming . 
  with the japanese fleet being no match for the combined chinese-korean fleet , dai viet unconditionally surrendered . 
  without a ** single ** chinese soldier being harmed , the indochinese fools have been utterly destroyed , and japan curtailed , at least for now . 
  the future seems glorious for our heavenly empire . 
  the emperor wishes to send its gratitude to the righteous nations of kutai and bengal . 
  may our friendship be long and glorious . 
  tl ; dr : the empire strikes back, 
  employer 's fine with me coming in at 9:15 . 
  traject cards are super expensive by comparison . 
  do n't do them if you can avoid them . 
  altijd vrij is 333/month . 
  i have the same route . 
  that 's a bit of a myth . 
  i pay 100/month for the entire country . 
  try to do that with a car . 
  gas + insurance + taxes + depreciation amounts to several hundred euros at least . 
  which is why i said i was n't entirely sure of that one . 
  that 's likely because you booked tickets in advance . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/609cyg/the_dutch_state_railway_is_holding_almost_1/df4tj2f/ ) for a comparison of tickets bought without buying them ahead of time . 
  additional source : lived in berlin for a year . 
  ever visited abroad ? 
  for comparison , a trip of about an hour in various countries : [ ns ] ( https://imgur.com/a/tw8h8 ) charges $ 14.40 for utrecht -  eindhoven ( 91 km per google maps = $ 0.16 / km ) . 
  [ deutsche bahn ] ( https://imgur.com/a/tv3sw ) charges $ 24.50 for bonn -  d\u00fcsseldorf ( 71km per google maps = $ 0.34 / km ) . 
  [ sbb ] ( https://imgur.com/a/v7ddv ) charges chf34 for basel -  z\u00fcrich ( 87km per google maps = $ 0.35 / km at 34chf = 31 eur ) . 
  [ sncf ] ( https://imgur.com/a/thyk9 ) charges a whopping $ 88 for lille -  paris ( 204km by google maps = $ 0.43 / km ) . 
  i 'm not entirely sure whether that french one is correct , but by a quick search , ns is not expensive at all . 
  please visit abroad if you think it 's expensive . 
  deutsche bahn charges about twice the amount ns does per km , not to mention uk or swiss rates . 
  a ) this sounds like a motion , rather than a bill b ) link ( preferably from rijksoverheid.nl or tweedekamer.nl ) that backs up your claim ? 
  thank you . 
  that percentage does not include oil revenues . 
  with oil revenues , its deficit is somewhat smaller ( tho , still , admittedly , staggering ) . 
  may was a remainer . 
  she did n't want brexit to happen , but in the position of prime minister she has to see it through . 
  you 're being down voted for asking a source .
