  the party used to be led by femke halsema until 2010 , who is a great politician . 
  after she resigned ( to spend more time with the kids etc ) , there was essentially a bit of a power and charisma vacuum inside the party . 
  her initial replacement was n't truly bad , but definitely could n't match halsema . 
  they really blew it leading up to the 2012 election with party infighting . 
  now , they 've finally found a leadership person again . 
  also , a lot of people who used to vote for labour party are now voting for gl , after the implosion of labour . 
  yep , to be honest , this one got me angry . 
  ... ... for a split second . 
  he just [ levels ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/unprecedented-destruction-of-kurdish-city-of-cizre/a-19265927 ) them instead . 
  actually , we were [ rather close ] ( http://nltimes.nl/2017/03/14/rotterdam-mayor-special-officers-permission-shoot-weekend-protests-turkish-consulate ) to answering that question , as dutch special forces were called and had permission to shoot if kaya 's guards turned out to be armed and hostile . 
  also , our allies ( cough france , cough uk ) did not respond to requests for an air raid when it finally was requested . 
  that means ukraine will get disqualified from eurovision , i suppose . 
  oh wow , that 's a joy to watch !, 
  there 's also a massive backlash against windmills . 
  everywhere the government tries - and this government _ has _ tried , contratry to popular reddit belief - windmills , it gets sued by the local population . 
  essentially , they 've become huge nimbys . 
  i fail to understand why , but evidently many people see them as ` horizon pollution ' . 
  our population density also ensures any windmills on land will be close to residential areas . 
  why would wilders benefit from this ? 
  for once , even _ he _ ca n't criticize the current government . 
  if it has any implications for the elections , it 's that the current parties in office may get a seat or two more than they have in the polls right now . 
  just for clarity : those percentages are of voters of said parties supporting the government in this issue . 
  especially since they 're just about the very definition of neo-liberal . 
  china ( ming ), 
  tulips as a symbol would be ambiguous in this current conflict , for tulips are also a turkish symbol . 
  they 're native to the place , after all . 
  china is interested in sino-european trade relations . 
  what does france have to say about it ? 
  that website is n't particularly well-known for its politeness , and they absolutely hate the cookie law xd, 
  free speech is guaranteed under the dutch constitution . 
  we have an absolute ban on censorship as far as the content is concerned . 
  that was n't the matter here at all . 
  hosting a rally requires a permit , for public order and security reasons . 
  the location turkey wanted to use was unfit for the amount of attendees . 
  nl was negotiating with turkey on providing an alternative location . 
  and that 's when turkey started threatening with sanctions , and this entire incident started . 
  not because free speech , but because of an arrogant foreign government which does not want to stick to local rules and regulations . 
  thank you , denmark !, 
  they kinda do . 
  in older dutch , oranges are called * appeltjes van oranje * , and oranges were used to decorate the palace in amsterdam during the most recent coronation . 
  [ true story ] ( http://www.fluwel.com/eating-tulip-bulbs ), 
  i think my dietist would approve of such protests . 
  oh , how pathetic . 
  never seen it before . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , there currently exists no mechanism to forcibly expel or suspend members from nato . 
  so , even if we might wish to , it 's impossible to do so . 
   committing sudoku seppuku ? 
  or is a completing a puzzle lethal these days too ? 
  dutch cheese best cheese :p . 
  there actually was a thread on twitter by some international law folks - ~ ~ i 'll try to find the ~ ~ [ link ] ( https://twitter.com/mariekedehoon/status/840669362545655808 ) - that argued that the armed guards may have constituted a violation of international law as a `` show of force '' . 
  edit : thanks to / u/yokuyin for the link . 
  yeah , i do n't think i 've ever seen us have this kind of conflict with another nation . 
  nah , it 's like a three year old toddler throwing a tantrum . 
  today has been crazy . 
  ha , no , i only found out after writing that comment . 
  i erm ... gave in to my urges ? 
  :p took me some time to find a shop that actually sold them tho . 
  what defines being a ` startup ' in this case ? 
  ccp is 20 years old now , spotify and adyen both 11 . 
  why is the eu still silent on this ? 
  i am absolutely _ not _ a socialist , but if aboutaleb were running in the general elections , there 'd be a chance i 'd vote for him . 
  awesome guy . 
  [ haaretz ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/1.776576 ) - probably a more trustworthy source - is now too reporting it too . 
  i guess not anymore . 
  does n't say anything for that particular one . 
  found a few nearby ones , and they do have the text itself . 
  also , turns out the location is just centered on the google maps center of the locality , so it 's not that granular . 
  there 's one just a few streets from where i grew up !, 
  however , it does n't say _ what _ the inscription said . 
  where can i find that ? 
  big bazar sells them for $ 1.49 , in the soccer section ;-) . 
  they are pretty pro-eu , in reality . 
  they might use some anti-eu rhetoric as the ` law & order ' party , but when it comes down to it the single market is just good for business , and that 's what they really care about . 
  you 'd have to ask a linguist , really . 
  but personally , 17th century is more understandable to me than frysian . 
  while the grammar and sentence structure of 17th century dutch looks way more complicated that modern dutch , the vocabulary is still largely the same . 
  belgium is a country that should n't exist . 
  i suddenly feel an urge to buy a dutch flag . 
  even as a republican ( in the monarchy-should-be-abolished sense , not the american politics sense ) , i have to agree koninginnedag is a blast . 
  only day literally everyone can be dutch , as long as you wear orange . 
  my german friends have a bit of same reaction when i talk about the ns . 
  it has eh ... different connotations there :p, 
  because our spellings rules actually try to come up with a system that makes the pronunciation unambiguous ( unlike english , where an ` o ' can have 7 different pronunciations ) . 
  the five basic vowels ( a , o , i , e , u ) all come in two shapes : one short , and one long . 
  in the most simple case , the long version is written with a doubled vowel . 
  for instance , ` schap ' means ` shelf ' and ` schaap ' ( pronounced differently ! ), 
  means ` sheep ' ( singular ) . 
  now , there 's also a distinction between a ` closed syllable ' and an ` open syllable ' . 
  closed ones end in a consonant , open ones do not . 
  in a closed syllable , the above rule applies . 
  but in an open syllable , any vowel is pronounced in its long version . 
  now , to keep a syllable closed , we may have to then introduce an extra written letter . 
  for instance , plurals are made by slapping an ' ~ en ' - suffix to words . 
  so ` schap ' + ` en ' = ` scha ** p ** pen ' , with a double p because we want to keep it two closed syllables . 
  otoh , ` schaap ' + ` en ' = ` schapen ' , with a single p , because the first syllable becomes open and therefore the a is already pronounced in a long manner . 
  it 's not even modern dutch , haha, 
  because he will use it for political gain . 
  he likes to portray himself as some kind of victimized entity , and he will absolutely use any initiative to amend the law to his personal favor . 
  aruba is n't technically part of the netherlands . 
  it 's part of the kingdom , but is its own country .
