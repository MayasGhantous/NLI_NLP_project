  bonaire _ is _ part of the netherlands proper , and there indeed is a direct flight from amsterdam to bonaire . 
  even if more of the general internet comes here , the hivemind will continue . 
  those with similar world views or interests will just make a new subreddit . 
  that 's how reddit works . 
  if , or when , / r/europe will get flooded the_donald , i 'm sure someone will create a / r/nexteurope or something , and we 'll move that way . 
  we 've not only _ found _ peace , for many of us in the west , war even seems impossible to _ contemplate _ at this point . 
  at least , until fairly recently . 
  oh wow , he 's human too . 
  who would have thought ?!, 
  depends if it 's gross income or net income , i think . 
  if it 's net income , i 'm definitely in that statistic . 
  if it 's gross income , i 'm a bit below . 
  time to move to malta !, 
  that 's the entire point . 
  when your usual resolution of time is measured in thousands of years , distinguishing between ` tomorrow ' and ` in a few decades ' is difficult . 
  yep . 
  it needs a cultural shift , which is likely to take decades . 
   in the aforementioned story about hillary saying that coal mining was a dying industry , it was n't mentioned that her next sentence was that she wanted to provide training to give those people more options in a changing economy . 
  my region ( see flair ) had a [ thriving mining community ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mining_in_limburg ) until the late 1960s . 
  during that time , it was one of the richest areas in the entire country . 
  when the mines closed , our government told the _ exact _ same thing . 
  re-schooling etc. 
  i can tell you , that does n't work . 
  the amount of jobs that returned were scant , and totally unfit for the populace . 
  what followed was endemic unemployment ( by dutch standards ) , which only now , 50 years later , is slowly abating . 
  now , such things might be the inevitable rise and fall of industries , and their dependents , but politicians saying that all the ex-miners will become happy and wealthy white collar workers are lying . 
  and they know it too . 
  your partition was a necessary evil , for we must protect indochina from muslim aggression . 
  a large fraction of those applying for asylum and getting insta-refused in the netherlands are bosnian and albanians . 
  refugees from other conflicts in the 90s did not move back . 
  there 's still a lot of lebanese in germany from the lebanese civil war , and similarly many refugees from iraq never went back after moving to the netherlands during the gulf war . 
  have these people never heard of the euphemism treadmill ? 
  [ here ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html ) for the day before , [ here ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/elections/forecast/president ) for the day itself . 
  we vote for individuals , technically . 
  it ai n't over until the fad lady sings . 
  polls said there was an 80 % chance of clinton winning on the day of the elections . 
  but it started with the former , and he needed protection nearly straight from the outset . 
  i assume conscripts get food and/or accommodation , tho ? 
  under my tax system the value of this should be counted as income . 
  there is another side to the medal tho : if a company can not be profitable with even very low wages , its business model may simply not be fit for the market , and it should go bankrupt . 
  oh , you 're right . 
  thanks :-) . 
  the biggest upcoming debate is on march 14 , on npo1 . 
  although there are smaller debates nearly every day right now . 
  just watch jinek at 11pm daily . 
  oh we [ do n't ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/euthanasie_in_nederland ) ? 
  i think the vvd is not going to cooperate with the pvv under any circumstances . 
  the pvv has sowed that much `` kwaad bloed '' in 2012 after pulling out of the austerity talks , that any cooperation is going to be impossible . 
  the spring agreement of 2012 showed that most other parties are willing to compromise if the stability of the country is at risk . 
  it 's liberal in the _ classical _ sense of the word . 
  that is : economic liberalism . 
  ideologically , it 's also ` socially liberal ' , in the sense of personal freedom . 
  we have gay marriage , euthanasia , all that kind of stuff because of a government the vvd was part of ( paars i & ii ) . 
  big exception to that ideology is concerning drugs , of which i just do n't get how they can be against recreational use . 
  the vvd only turned down one debate , after the host channel changed the agreed-upon format . 
  it is participating in all other major debates . 
  it 's only the pvv that _ systematically _ turns down public appreances . 
  at this point it 's just his trademark look . 
  meisje met de parel is such a pretty painting . 
  and of course the first comment under the article is an anti-vaxxer . 
  * sigh * . 
  actually , the port authority has a shortage of workers . 
  kids do n't want to study mechanics anymore . 
  but nearly no one would have issues with further cooperation in benelux . 
  so we might see several mini-unions inside the larger european union . 
  i 'm all for # 5 , but europe has to come up with a solution for those who _ do n't _ benefit from globalization and open borders , or else it will loose even further legitimacy . 
   i do n't trust national governments with . 
  so why would you trust supra-national governments ? 
  i think one should n't discount different cultural norms . 
  in some countries , begging is common . 
  in other countries it 's not , and in some of those , it 's even considered faux-pas/against basic etiquette . 
  thank you , finland !, 
  similar-sounding allegations have been going around for [ years ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2015/10/martin_schulz_35_limosines_40.html ) in ` certain ' dutch media . 
  now , said media have to be taken with a huge bucket of salt , but linking schulz with fraud is n't exactly new . 
  dutch media , in general , is particularly sensitive to those kind of things , for [ cultural ] ( http://www.elsevier.nl/buitenland/achtergrond/2017/02/wat-koninkje-schulz-deed-is-in-veel-europese-landen-normaal-458569/ ) reasons . 
  it 's about time france gets a good-looking president . 
  this seems like creating a storm in a glass of water just for the sake of it . 
  not sure if this is the wisest decision by the ep . 
  also , where did the ` crimes ' take place ? 
  in brussels , or in france ? 
  too much internet for me today ... 
  what is vowel harmony ? 
  which is so funny , because genitive is the only case ( apart from nominative ) that survived in dutch . 
  dutch also follows this pattern , but no longer in all pronouns * jij - jouw - jou * hij - zijn - hem * zij ( singular ) - haar - haar * zij ( plular ) - hun - hen * wij - ons - ons, 
  limburgs still uses _ d' n _ , although it 's not used as a case . 
  it occurs when the following word starts with a vowel . 
  so _ d' n appel _ . 
  it 's a bit like french , in that regard . 
  you are wise not to further press the issue , bengal . 
  the asian co-prosperity sphere will not tolerate arrogant outsiders from prodding its borders . 
  sincerely , the great heavenly empire of china ( current acps president ) . 
  the acps * will * protect itself from outside encroachment . 
  yes , we had . 
  and it was atrocious . 
  combined , i think it probably took about an hour for everyone to be able to even enter . 
  oh yes !, 
  ** china ** the great heavenly empire of china - also known as ming - is a peaceful place in the late 1440s . 
  as a founder of the asian co-prosperity sphere ( acps ) , it is a beacon of stability , international diplomacy and justice . 
  current foreign policy is centered around peaceful and fruitful relations with its neighbors , primarily via the aforementioned acps . 
  of the utmost importance is the containment of the mongol and steppe peoples .
