  while , at current , they pose little threat , we must never allow [ 1206 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_empire ) to happen again , of which china only recovered [ so recently ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_ming_dynasty#revolt_and_rebel_rivalry ) . 
  this is not only to the betterment of the chinese , but will safeguard all of eurasia . 
  as such , ming has campaigned against korchin and kara del in the mid-1440s . 
  after jianzhou 's dangerous territorial gains , plans were made with our dear friends in korea to oust jianzhou from the face of the earth . 
  just before commencing on this undoubtedly glorious campaign , the emperor suffered from an [ illness ] ( https://bd23.https.cdn.softlayer.net/80bd23/142.4.51.106/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/program_has_stopped_working_error.png ) , and his duties had to be taken over by his faithful automata . 
  in his sickbed , the emperor has learned that , indeed , the campaign was victorious . 
  this is a very well-written article . 
  it 's refreshing to see a nuanced position in this day and age . 
  _ facepalm _ . 
  the office evidently did not consult homosexuals , as any gay man could have told them every ` gay sauna ' is purely sexual . 
   but not as a direct reference to the bird . 
  in some cases , we still do . 
  parelhoen is an example . 
  cereal = grain . 
  that means everything made from wheat , rye , barley etc. 
  we had other root vegetables . 
  parsnips , in particular , are somewhat reminiscent of potato . 
  somehow those vanished from modern diets . 
  thank you , slovenia !, 
  i only know the the republikaner from their hilarious election posters in berlin for the 2013 election . 
  '' , and then showing 4 colored butts . 
  it was an extremely interesting project that reprinted old newspapers hmm . . 
  they have just [ started ] ( http://www.deoorlogskranten.nl/ ) that doing that in the netherlands a few months ago . 
  afaik , we do n't ban such things , with the only exception being selling mein kampf since the dutch translation is copyrighted by the dutch state ( who _ will _ press charges for infringement ) . 
  not sure if i 'm being 100 % correct , but i think a hyphen is used when it concerns a compound word , whereas a trema _ must _ be used when it is simply a grammatical feature . 
  you would n't write _ bacteri-en _ for instance , but _ zee-egel _ does n't look that odd . 
  yes , it 's only used to put emphasis on something . 
  very useful if you ca n't use formatting ( looking at you , facebook ) ;-) . 
  \u0428 looks like a stocky rendition of hebrew \u05e9 , which has the same phonetic value . 
  by putting emphasis on the word . 
  the connotation is of course different for each case . 
  in my example sentence , yes , it would be in a condescending tone . 
  another example , with a completely different connotation would be [ today 's headline about nasa discovery ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2159538-aarde-achtige-planeten-ontdekt-mogelijk-met-oceanen-vol-water.html ) : _ aarde-achtige planeten ontdekt , mogelijk m\u00e9t oceanen vol water _ -  _ earth-like planets discovered , possibly ** with ** oceans filled with water _ . 
  ha , in this case most people would write _ twee-eiig _ , but i suppose the version without the hyphen is technically correct . 
  yep . 
  in fact , the same word ( spelled _ \u00e4\u00f6f _ ) is used as a mild insult :p . 
  dutch diacritics actually do not signify a change in pronunciation of the underlying letter . 
  the double dot ( called ` trema ' in dutch , not umlaut ) over a vowel indicates the start of a new syllable . 
  it 's used when the preceding character is also a vowel , and could be confused . 
  zee\u00ebn is two syllables . 
  the accent on vowels is used to _ stress _ a syllable . 
  --  `` have you ** still ** not done so ? '', 
  as for limburgish , some pronunciation-altering diacritics do exist there if we use the only codified into spelling ( maastricht dialect ) : * _ \u00f6 _ : same as in german * _ \u00e4\u00f6 _ : like french _ oeu _ . 
  * _ \u00e8 _ : somewhere between an i and an e . it furthermore still uses some umlaut-like features in its grammar , but since the spelling is mostly based on dutch spelling , those do not get a diacritic . 
  ( e.g. 
  i think you underestimate the amount of people who ca n't afford a car , do not have a personal laundry machine , and ca n't afford a yearly holiday , yet still make average income . 
   maybe it was just placebo , the correct term for this would be [ nocebo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nocebo ) . 
  as for flavor , there 's no arguing about that . 
  there is n't any caffeine in sprite , and i buy the sugar-free variety . 
  aspartame is about the most researched additive ever , and one would have to drink about [ 7l of diet coke a day for it to have any measurable negative effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aspartame#intake ) . 
  by that time , you 're more likely to have water poisoning already . 
  i love sprite . 
  nice that it 's back !, 
  may i reserve china/ming ? 
  thanks . 
  i went to a catholic elementary school . 
  we never read the actual bible . 
  we read excerpts , and sometimes larger sections from the children 's version , but no one ever had to read the full thing . 
  only as a teenager i did an attempt to read the complete version , but i stopped midway through the exodus because it is such dry literature . 
  i think completely reading the bible is mostly a protestant thing . 
  catholicism centers largely around tradition and customs , and you do n't learn those by reading about them , you learn those by _ doing _ them . 
  note : i consider myself atheist . 
  i always felt sad after watching this . 
  oh , thank you for reminding me of the title of that !, 
  twenty years ago since i last watched that , i think . 
  i think that 's exactly what makes it so exceptional . 
  life also has dark sides . 
  no reason to hide that . 
  probably coal-fired electric plants ? 
  the ash of that is relatively radioactive . 
  of course we had them . 
  there 's even a few in limburgish !, 
  resident of the hague . 
  the europol offices [ look ] ( https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/images/europol_building01.jpg ) like they came straight out of a spy movie . 
  the icc building just [ across ] ( http://hrbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/icty-2-1.jpeg ) the street is the one with the many satellite dishes tho . 
  thank you !, 
  would be interesting to see if the strain on the balearic islands is the same as the [ strain detected in italy ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/gcf_000811965.1 ) . 
   btw you fucking buy australian olive oil ? 
  yeah , i was similarly flabbergasted when i saw that item listed !, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.ah.nl/zoeken?rq=olijfolie ) is the selection generally available over here . 
  any look good ? 
  as an olive ( oil ) consumer from northern europe , how can i make sure i buy european olives/oil ? 
   second dutch republic third actually . 
  the bataafse republiek was the second one , though shortly lived . 
  thank you !, 
  sack the monarchs !, 
  animosity ? 
  some jokes aside , there are n't any hard feelings whatsoever . 
  the idea of re-unification ( see the _ re _ part in that word ) seems to be somewhat more popular the netherlands than in flanders . 
  as someone who has grown up around the border ( see flair ) , i 'd love us to get back together . 
  realistically , i know it 's probably better to do so slowly through the benelux union , but we can dream , ca n't we ? 
  i approve of this map . 
  if you can reasonably assume it is stolen it _ is _ illegal . 
  you 're willingly participating is _ heling _ . 
  since this is a theme park , and not a town , dejima island in nagasaki is probably better . 
  although that too is a theme park these days , at least it has an actual history as a place of residence . 
  but ... how did they manage to pronounce it right then ? 
  i mean , anyone who understands actual german does n't _ accidentally _ sing the old anthem . 
  under 50 euro would definitely be stolen in nl , and since it 's clear it 's stolen buying one would be illegal ( trade in stolen goods ) . 
  i got my second hand bike for $ 195 .
