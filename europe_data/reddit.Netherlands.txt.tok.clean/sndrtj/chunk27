  is a fairly recent premium brand tho . 
  ** netherlands ** this week is nearly only politics , as the campaign for the elections of 15 march is picking up steam . 
  since the economy is going well , nearly all parties are launching `` gifts '' in their campaigns . 
  personally i would n't trust any of these pledges , but here 's a few : * the vvd ( classical liberals ) are pledging [ $ 2b for care homes for the elderly ] ( http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/27575995/__vvd__2_mld_voor_verpleeghuizen__.html ) . 
  this is after they completely slashed funding for said institutions with the current government . 
  they are also pledging to lower taxes by [ $ 11.9 ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2157435-middeninkomens-profiteren-van-vvd-plannen-uitkeringen-niet.html ) by lowering the rate on the second and third income tax bracket . 
  this would be advantageous to the middle class , but not the lower incomes . 
  they are making a claim that every working person should get $ 500 euro extra . 
  this is extremely similar the vvd 's claim last elections where it claimed $ 1000 extra per worker . 
  as no one got the full $ 1000 , this was deemed a campaign fault . 
  it 's interesting to see the d66 repeating the same `` mistakes '' . 
  * groenlinks ( greens ) wants to completely [ abolish ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2157068-groenlinks-wil-af-van-werkgeverspremie-laagbetaalde-banen.html ) certain taxes employers have to pay for lowly skilled employees . 
  they think this will slash unemployment , by making it cheaper to hire unskilled or lowly skilled employees . 
  * pvda ( labour ) joins the ` lets-slash-the-taxes ' - bandwagon , and is [ pledging ] ( http://www.nu.nl/politiek/4459143/pvda-pleit-8-miljard-lastenverlichting-werknemers.html?redirect=1 ) to lower taxes paid by employees by $ 8b . 
  going completely against gl 's plans , they want to _ raise _ the taxes the employer has to pay , so that the employee pays less . 
  then , we had some popcorn-worthy news : * wilders ( pvv ; extreme-right/populist/anti-islam ) [ photoshopped ] ( http://www.elsevier.nl/nederland/achtergrond/2017/02/wilders-onder-vuur-na-bewerkte-foto-pechtold-met-hamas-447785/ ) a picture , so that d66 ( progressive liberals ) leader alexander pechtold appeared to be protesting in favor of sharia . 
  pechtold obviously was n't too happy about that . 
  * denk ( pro-immigrant populists/islamists ) is using [ fake accounts on social media ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/02/10/de-trollen-van-denk-6641045-a1545547 ) in their campaign . 
  a newspaper ( nrc ) got hands on a whatsapp conversation , where on their prime members is asking someone to put a comment under an amsterdam alderman 's facebook post with a troll account . 
  and nokia vanished . 
  there was a bit more in the night . 
  went out for a walk at 1am . 
  the crack-crack of walking on fresh snow :d . unfortunately , quite some has melted already in the western part of the country . 
   say jaros\u0142aw one more goddamn time !, 
  polish orthography always takes me aback . 
  how _ is _ it pronounced ? 
  how is this a legit source ? 
   `` it 's more expensive for u.s. farmers to comply with the eu 's requirements than for beef producers from other countries so the americans are just being less efficient , and want to solve that by slapping on a few tariffs . 
  so not paying your taxes is going to solve those issues ? 
  nope . 
  it 's going to make them worse . 
  sometimes you have to swallow the bitter pill to make things better in the future . 
   persistent deficits persistent deficits can _ only _ exist when there are persistent surpluses elsewhere . 
  therefore , surpluses = = deficits , in terms of badness . 
  this is one of the better ones !, 
  what makes you think so ? 
  that really sounds like an exercise in conspiracy theory . 
  volkert van der graaf studied environmental sciences . 
  he founded an organization called `` vereniging millieu-offensief '' [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/volkert_van_der_graaf#levensloop ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://resource.wur.nl/nl/show/vereniging-milieuoffensief-in-verwarring.htm ) , which translates to something like ` association for environmental offensive ' , in 1992 . 
  he is a vegan . 
  he has always been clear about his motive . 
  a few months before fortuyn 's assassination , the intelligence services intercepted a phone call from a ` environmental activist ' saying ` he [ fortuyn ] must die !, 
  by an extreme-left nut . 
  why not ? 
  wilders has always styled himself as pro-gay right from the beginning . 
  ha , you 're right . 
  somehow i stropped scrolling just above the toelichting !, 
  my bad . 
  so that boils down to approx 826m . 
  yes , i could n't quickly find how much it _ only _ spends on water . 
  but , as here is the case , water and roads often mix in nl , so i 'm not sure that 's even possible to enumerate . 
  that railway line effectively has zero protection . 
  we throw a lot of money at flood protection . 
  the national water authority has an annual budget upwards of [ $ 2b ] ( http://www.rijksbegroting.nl/2014/voorbereiding/begroting,kst186616_10.html ) . 
  that is excluding the budgets of the 24 [ water boards ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_board_\\ ( netherlands \\ ) ) . 
  my local water board has a [ budget ] ( https://www.hhdelfland.nl/afbeeldingen/begroting-2017 ) of $ 246m . 
  every dutch household pays a water board tax . 
  now compare that with the _ whopping _ ( / s ) amount of [ 40m gbp ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/3487072c-b213-11e5-8358-9a82b43f6b2f ) david cameron pledged to combat floods . 
  cough cough . 
  also , by [ law ] ( http://wetten.overheid.nl/bwbr0025458/2017-01-01 ) , the most important levees have an accepted flooding risk of at most 1 in 100.000 years ( with most other levees being in the 1/3000 to 1/10 .000 year ballpark . 
  see attachment ii ( bijlage ii ) of the linked law ) . 
  oh god , the cringe . 
  quite some do n't style themselves like that . 
  for example , wilders has portrayed himself as pro-gay right from the beginning . 
  that said , he refuses to even answer the largest gay organization here with questions about his policy plans concerning items relevant for lgbt citizens . 
  i think you 're a bit too optimistic . 
  statistically , 25 % of people vote wilders . 
  yet , absolutely no one dares say they do so at e.g. 
  work . 
  i think it 's going to be a complete clusterfuck , to be honest . 
  without the pvv , we 're going to need a 6-party coalition . 
  if the pvv plummets in favor of the vvd ( it 's happened before ) , that makes a center-right coalition of vvd-cda-d66 slightly more likely - which is the only ideologically possible coalition that even comes remotely close to 76 seats . 
  all other options include mixing right - and left-wing parties ( and fyi , d66 is economically the very definition of neo-liberal . 
  it 's _ never _ going to work with the sp ) . 
  realistically , that 's going to mean 3 options : 1 ) the longest coalition talks ever , belgium-style . 
  2 ) a national unity government , something we 've never had . 
  3 ) new elections later this year or in early 2018 . 
  there is one additional big massive reason why wilders wo n't get into a coalition : his behaviour preceding the 2012 election . 
  from 2010 to 2012 , he gave his support to a minority government of the vvd and cda . 
  because of economic reasons , mid-term negotiations regarding austerity measures were required . 
  after quite a while of negotiations , it seemed there would be a deal . 
  but while the vvd and cda were already preparing their speeches to the press , wilders pulled back in a show of political backstabbing the likes of which this country had rarely seen before . 
  because of this both the vvd and cda - the only two parties he could potentially work with - do n't trust him at all , and will refuse to work with him in the foreseeable future . 
   uses a mutant program ninja mayors now ? 
  what a time to be alive !, 
   or campaign for `` an independent holland '' ? 
  need a refresher of your own history ? 
  you guys found a guy with a crazy claim , [ put him on a boat to scheveningen , and proclaimed him king of the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_i_of_the_netherlands#return ) . 
  or that time you wanted to [ partition belgium and make a british protectorate out of antwerp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talleyrand_partition_plan_for_belgium ) ? 
  it 's the latter . 
  some facebook groups organizing a rally in the hague this april . 
  oh , this is juicy !, 
   rome 's mayor was surprised to be the beneficiary of an city officer 's 30000 $ life insurance . 
  shortly after the stipulation said employee was promoted did n't she run on an _ anti _ - corruption ticket ? 
  [ this ] ( https://zwitserlaan.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dsc_0916.jpg ) is how our ballot papers look like . 
  that pic of is from the 2012 election ; the form for the upcoming election needs to be even larger because there are so many parties . 
  much less so than in the states . 
  there 's no european equivalent of the american [ boom town ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boomtown ) . 
  packing up and leaving for the next place is deeply culturally ingrained in the united states . 
  it is not in europe .
