  part of that is also still geography ( vast tracks of the united states are still unincorporated , and technically still ` up for grabs ' ) . 
  ah , wikileaks again joining the ranks of russia , eh . 
  assange lost all credibility in recent months . 
  dutch eurocoins say something similar . 
  does n't mean the country is very religious . 
   i am so proud of us . 
  you have all right to be fucking mega-proud !, 
  the past few days have been absolutely inspiring to watch . 
  go romanians !, 
   sounds kinda comedic yes , sigh . 
  the times i 've been asked to say something containing a diminutive , when i lived in berlin , for shits and giggles is not small . 
  germans , y u no use diminutives ? 
  ** netherlands ** * the final list of political parties participating in the elections of 15 march has been completed . 
  this is still too large for the traditional ballot paper , which ` only ' fits 21 parties . 
  this means we 'll get a humongous ballot paper this year of 1 meter wide . 
  * the abortion fund established by international development minister ploumen , to offset the abortion aid removed by president trump , is [ joined ] ( http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nederland/politiek/steun-uit-13-landen-voor-abortusfonds-ploumen ) by 13 countries . 
  * two major banks , rabobank and ing , have declared they are [ not ] ( http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4332/groen/article/detail/4457584/2017/02/03/rabobank-gaat-gasboringen-in-waddenzee-niet-financieren.dhtml ) funding any gas drilling projects in the wadden sea . 
  the wadden sea a unesco world heritage site , and both banks do not want to fund any projects potentially damaging unesco sites . 
  * a majority of parliament wants to amend article 1 of the [ constitution ] ( https://www.government.nl/binaries/government/documents/regulations/2012/10/18/the-constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-the-netherlands-2008/the-constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-the-netherlands-2008.pdf ) , to specifically mention [ sexuality and the disabled ] ( http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/4439862/kamer-wil-gehandicapten-en-homos-in-grondwet-opnemen.html ) . 
  article one of the constitution bans all discrimination on any grounds , but specifically mentions a few categories . 
  the current text ( official english translation ) reads :  all persons in the netherlands shall be treated equally in equal circumstances . 
  discrimination on the grounds of religion , belief , political opinion , race or sex or on any other grounds whatsoever shall not be permitted . 
  * since the article already contains a _ on any grounds whatsoever _ clause , specifically mentioning sexuality and disabilities is mainly symbolic . 
  amending the constitution at the end of a parliament 's term makes the process much faster , which is likely why it 's being discussed this close to elections . 
  the [ process ] ( https://www.parlement.com/id/vhnnmt7k6sji/procedure_grondwetsherziening ) to amend the constitution first involves both the lower and upper house to pass an amendment law . 
  parliament then has to be _ dissolved _ , after which a new parliament ( again both lower and upper houses ) must pass the amendment a second time with super-majorities . 
  * after an eight hour lasting parliamentary debate , undersecretary of finance wiebes gets a [ final chance ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2156257-laatste-kans-wiebes-om-problemen-belastingdienst-aan-te-pakken.html ) to fix the problems at the tax department , caused by an overly popular departure package . 
  ** in non-political news ** * someone threw [ gasoline ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2156300-dader-in-brand-steken-kapper-nog-onvindbaar.html ) on a hairdresser in enschede , and set the man on fire . 
  the suspect has not been caught yet . 
  * tv-biologist freek vonk was [ bitten ] ( http://www.ad.nl/binnenland/freek-vonk-flink-toegetakeld-door-haai-dit-is-foute-boel~a2c83057/ ) by a shark ( note : bloody pictures ) . 
  it should open in may 2019 . 
  * the dutch economy is [ growing unexpectedly quickly ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2155750-dnb-nederlandse-economie-groeit-verrassend-krachtig.html ) . 
  new projections for this year will be a growth of 2.3 % , whereas the previous projection of last month was 2.1 % . 
  with a bit of luck unemployment numbers will fall below 5 % at the end of this year . 
  * the university of delft [ wins ] ( https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/01/at-spacex-headquarters-27-teams-test-out-half-size-hyperloop-pods/ ) the hyperloop pod competition , with the highest overall score . 
   n-va wants to keep the belgian nuclear plants open after 2025 , which was supposed to be the date our country fases out nuclear power . 
  are there any plans to construct new ones in stead of keeping the old ones open ? 
  tihange is not exactly the safest installation ever . 
  wilders has been slightly [ dropping ] ( https://www.allepeilingen.com/ ) in the polls lately , with the difference between the pvv and the vvd now being entirely within the error bars . 
  there is a historical precedent for the pvv doing good in the polls , but not in the ballot . 
  even so , he wo n't join any government . 
  he 's angered too many politicians in 2012 for that . 
  the vvd has made very clear they are not going to cooperate with him this time , under any circumstances . 
  and even though he might become the largest party , with 35 seats , that 's still less than 25 % of the vote . 
   france doing deals with the `` enemy '' will get you the top place on trump 's shit list . 
  remember ` freedom fries ' ? 
  wo n't be the first time france angers the americans , and likely wo n't be the last . 
   his mind will go into an endless loop and freeze seen too much westworld , have ya ? 
   , but it seems bielarus is getting a bit ut of their influence zone does this mean belarus is moving more towards the eu ? 
  and the likelihood of him actually being able to is infinitesimally small , i assume ? 
  i hope they will use the version with [ latin lyrics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_mefzb4yzk ), 
   to the brink of civil war is the situation really that drastic ? 
  i 'll wait with cheering until the papers revoking this decree are officially signed . 
  how is party that calls itself _ social _ democrats in alde ? 
  seen bepicolombo during the open day at estec a few years ago !, 
  it was bigger than i imagined . 
  all organic produce should be washed _ even more _ . 
  it 's much more likely to have cow shit on it ( since artificial fertilizers may not be used ) , with all the associated bacteria . 
  actually , that is only a relatively minor part of the economy . 
  he probably said something along the lines of ` modern germany must make sure the jewish people survive and thrive ' , which , tbh , is a reasonable stance considering german history . 
   attending european parliament sessions in strasbourg or brussels would be a bit of a challenge though . 
  it 's 2017 . 
  just leave it to the dutch : successful on the medway , against the spanish treasure fleets and the armada . 
   if the european union were to fragment , most of its goals could in any event be accomplished through eurovision . 
  i died xd, 
  this does n't look like a real source . 
  extremely bad english . 
  startling lack of punctuation . 
  no cited sources . 
  fake news , anyone ? 
  were free refills common in france , then ? 
  i 've only seen them once or twice here . 
  resident of the hague here . 
  occasionally use rotterdam-the hague airport for cheaper flights . 
  it 's getting busier . 
  also , most of my social life is in rotterdam , while some of my rotterdammer friends work in the hague , and both cities even share a subway network . 
  i 'd say it would be pretty ok to count them as one big thing , especially since it 's essentially one big continuous build-up area . 
  although , most people in the netherlands would probably define the entire randstad as the big ` non-metropolitan ' area . 
  includes all the big cities and their suburbs . 
  it is possible to drive in a near-continuous ring of cities from dordrecht to amsterdam . 
  productivity is _ not _ gdp/capita . 
  productivity is expressed in $ / h worked . 
  actually , we do n't do it like they do . 
  bidets are standard equipment in southern europe . 
  they literally wash their anus each and every time they take a dump . 
  we use some paper and call it a day . 
  you have an / s there , but soap is actually pretty detrimental to healthy skin . 
  soap causes dry , flaky skin , that is more susceptible to infection because all the commensal bacteria ( the ones you need ) are washed off as well . 
  what can do they about it ? 
  declare war on the vatican ? 
  popcorn !, 
  the [ imia incident ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/01/31/remembering-the-rocks-of-imia-18-years-later/ ) in 1996 could have led to war . 
  the dollar _ could _ fail . 
  the earth _ could _ be hit by an extinction level asteroid tomorrow . 
  any event possible _ could _ , at some point , happen indeed . 
  i think / u/idaltufalkard is referring to millions of migrants in europe . 
  not just the netherlands . 
  most of the `` refugees '' from libya are n't refugees . 
  they are n't syrians . 
  they are pure and simple economic migrants only going to europe to freeload on welfare .
