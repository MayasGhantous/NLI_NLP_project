  people indeed support helping _ refugees _ , they generally do _ not _ support welfare-freeloader-immigrants . 
  and the ngos banned . 
  seeing as trucks are considerably more deadly when stuff goes wrong than consumer cars , i think regulatory pressure will be higher too . 
  i find it typical for his commie/islamist-friendly persona . 
  what is an intercommunal ? 
  holy fuck , russia . 
  why so much ? 
  ah , thanks . 
  what 's the matter with israelis being more restricted ? 
  i was not aware that israel and north korea have a conflict . 
  gambia not red ? 
  and this is why galileo is so all-important . 
  gps is an american military system , and the us government could at any moment decide to stop providing its services to non-us locations . 
  and since we all know trump is n't too keen on providing other countries from benefiting from us services , europe really needs its own system . 
  yeah , could they have a sentence not mentioning or referring to the bible ? 
  greece needs to hire some bulgarians, 
  common english vernacular is to refer to metro carriages as trains . 
  ;-) berlin actually has two sets of metro systems ; the partly-underground u-bahn and the partly-raised s-bahn . 
  u-bahn trains are in yellow livery ; the s-bahn in red & yellow livery . 
  that sounds like the old trains in the u-bahn , correct ? 
  rolling stock from the [ 1960s ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bvg-baureihe_a3 ) , that is . 
  berlin , in general , feels like stepping back in the 80s :p . source : lived there for a year between 2012 and 2013 . 
  i mean , to be newsworthy . 
  last time i was in porto ( last august ) it felt rather quiet to be honest . 
  but i do n't know what rush hour looks like . 
  and i 'm not sure if lack of crowdedness is a good measure of public transport success . 
  in fact , it may be a sign of failure ; i.e. 
  it likely means the company is running a loss , and that ca n't be sustained for too long . 
  for example , the tokyo system is generally considered one of the best systems in the world ( and from personal experience , it really is a breeze ) , but rush hour still [ looks like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kkrr-qlt3i ) . 
  sardines in a can , eh ;-) . 
  even then , what is commonly viewed as a city may be different across regions . 
  a good friend of mine is from guimaraes , and she keeps insisting it is a city . 
  yet , from my perspective , it 's a mostly-disparate collection of villages with a ( lovely ) historic town in the middle of it . 
  i 'm not sure how one could live without a car there . 
  otoh , i found public transport in both porto and lisbon to be pretty decent . 
  have been to major cities with much , much , worse public transport ( looking at you , tel aviv ) . 
  i find this amount ... a bit small ? 
  haha , i did n't know this existed !, 
  amazing !, 
  i thought korpiklaani was cheesy , but now i even even cheesier metal music exists xd, 
  have you considered geography and urbanization rates ? 
  iirc , portugal is considerably more mountainous than lithuania . 
  a car is more of a necessity in that environment . 
  same thing if portugal has lower urbanization rate ( no clue , actually ) : people in villages tend to rely more on cars than people in cities . 
  i believe some tax rules expired at the end of 2015 . 
  edit : looked it up . 
  car sales in 2016 were at the [ lowest number in 47 years ] ( http://www.autoblog.nl/nieuws/autoverkoop-2016-het-laagste-niveau-in-47-jaar-94517 ) . 
  this was primarily caused for the lack of financial incentives concerning lease cars . 
  namely , if you drive a lease car in nl - something that is pretty common - a percentage of that car 's value gets added to your taxable income : the so-called ` bijtelling ' . 
  there are several different bijtelling brackets , and the more environmentally friendly the lower the bracket . 
  now , hybrid cars have moved off the lowest bracket of 4 % , with only full electric cars remaining there . 
  this was also my first thought !, 
  too little , probably . 
  as for pop music , i only really know t.a.t.u , and some recent eurovision entries ( musically , russia was simply best last year , imho ) . 
  since i have a policy of not funding countries banning homosexuality with my tourist euros , i wo n't visit russia until it rescinds its gay propaganda law . 
  western world !, 
   in the euro area , however , we do not see a trend away from cash . 
  by contrast , in recent years the growth in demand for banknotes in the euro area has by far exceeded that of economic output . 
  where is this cash growth happening ? 
  as far as nl is concerned , cash is becoming somewhat of a rarity , so i 'm surprised that 's not the general trend in the wider eurozone . 
  or that it should be free, 
  we have tax on water . 
   no it 's not . 
  who said that except you ? 
  from the article :   we received many messages like : ` you should be sent to gas chamber , ' ` i will cut your throat when i meet you , ' . 
   but we are talking here about activitists organizing international defamation action . 
  that ca n't be appreciated . 
  and i think they expect and enjoy that . 
  this way they can pretend they are oppressed and be popular in lgbt circles . 
  calling out your own government for having shit laws and regulations is defamation now ? 
  and even if you do n't agree with their position - it 's democracy , you 're allowed to - that 's no reason to expect death threats . 
  would the nato nukes in nl and italy count here ? 
  can those countries use those weapons without the us being practically involved ( legally is a different matter ) ? 
  nuff said . 
  ah , just like the same accounts that suddenly appeared downvoted conchita to oblivion on youtube after she won ? 
  this happens each time gay issues are discussed here . 
  some people seem to be really butthurt that gays can express themselves . 
   do n't provoke them because showing affection to loved ones is _ so _ provoking it 's violent incitement !, 
  riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight ... 
  ** netherlands ** * the gap in the weir at grave is still not fixed . 
  the national water authority has begun constructing a [ temporary dam ] ( http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/39681/nbsp/article/detail/4446387/2017/01/10/rijkswaterstaat-bouwt-dam-bij-stuw-in-grave.dhtml ) which should be in place in about 1.5 weeks from now . 
  it has to be thing that can be demolished in less than 48 hours in case of high waters . 
  * the fireworks casualty tally sadly has to be increased . 
  the fireworks sector organization says it wants to know exactly how it happened , so it can possibly adjust its products . 
  he was just 36 years old . 
  * a self-proclaimed journalist went to the mh17 site in eastern ukraine , and collected some items still lying about . 
  he then boasted about it on [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/spekkers/status/816753431239163904 ) , asking whether he should bring the bag including human remains to his mother . 
  dutch police managed to convince him to take it to the netherlands , where all of it was [ confiscated ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/01/08/journalist-twitterde-over-vuilniszak-vol-mh17-resten-6122308-a1540284 ) upon arrival . 
  the bag contained a human bone , which was identified to belong to one of the victims . 
  the tax services wanted to get rid of 5,000 un - or lowly skilled employees , and replace them with 1,500 highly skilled it people . 
  to give people an incentive to leave , it gave a ` departure package ' to those doing so . 
  now , it turned out that departure package was so successful a lot of the employees it wanted to _ keep _ were leaving as well . 
  it cost the state about half a billion euros , and parts of it were even deemed illegal such that the tax department had to give itself a fine . 
  the labour inspection has fined the party for exploitation in the past . 
  * a leaked police report to be presented to any new government ( we have elections in two months ) states that crime is [ underreported by a factor of five ] ( http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/39681/nbsp/article/detail/4447567/2017/01/13/nederlandse-politie-ziet-de-meeste-misdaad-niet.dhtml ) . 
  criminals are threatening to put the authorities on a `` unbridgeable distance '' . 
  this report may have potentially huge consequences for the upcoming elections . 
  * the campaign season has finally really started , with five parties holding party conferences this weekend . 
  some interesting results so far : * theocrats sgp [ removed ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2152937-doodstraf-uit-verkiezingsprogramma-sgp.html ) the death sentence from their party programme , and will also no longer campaign for the abolishment of gay marriage . 
  * socialist party frontman emile roemer is preemptively [ ruling out any coalition ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2152889-sp-leider-roemer-sluit-coalitie-met-vvd-definitief-uit.html ) with the liberals of the vvd .
