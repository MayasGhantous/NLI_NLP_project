  guess they took b\u00f6hmermann 's comment quite literally :p . 
  in the early 18th century , most dutch still used patronymics ; surnames were only introduced en masse in 1811 . 
  so unless they were ( semi - ) nobles or rich merchants , it 's not completely unlikely it might be invented . 
   alexander van der bellen i assume he is of dutch ( or flemish ) descent ? 
  translation of the article : `` ebru umar , the dutch columnist of turkish descent , has been arrested by turkish police in her house in kusadasi . 
  she said that herself on twitter , and later confirmed that to the post online by phone . 
  `` it is now clear to me that i have been arrested because of several tweets about president erdogan '' , she said to the site . 
  the department of foreign affairs says it knows about the case . 
  the embassy in ankara has been notified and is working on it . 
  umar wrote a critical piece last week in metro about the call of the turkish consulate to notify them about dutch insults to president erdogan . 
  she remarked : ` against any turkish dutchman who supports the call by the consulate and wants to play [ nsb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_movement_in_the_netherlands ) er by telling the dutch in the netherlands what to say about erdogan - the most megalomaniacal dictator the turkish republic has known since its establishment in 1923 - i 'd like to say the following : go fuck yourself ! ', 
  mp raymond knops ( cda ) nearly immediately responded on twitter . 
  he wants clarification from foreign minister bert koenders as fast as possible . 
  the situation that created the united kingdom of the netherlands in 1815 in the first place was orchestrated by foreign powers ( chiefly britain ) ; that it was broken up by those same foreign powers is not really surprising . 
  the economic situation was more complicated than you seem to suggest here . 
  at the time , especially wallonia was far more developed than any of the northern provinces . 
  the power balance in belgium has only shifted ever northwards since the 1960s , with the decline of heavy industry . 
  sadly this is most of european politics since at least the 90s . 
  good riddance . 
  how exactly does it limit his right of being a human being ? 
  afaik , there 's no such right as `` not to be insulted '' , and there should n't be . 
  have you ever * lived * in another country for a longer time ? 
  probably not , by the looks of it . 
  culture differences are real , and even though looks can be deceiving , they do have a pretty large impact on daily life . 
  take the netherlands and germany as an example . 
  to an outsider - or someone who 's never been abroad for longer than a few months - they might seem pretty close . 
  but at core , they have some striking differences : dutch culture is * much * more egalitarian , while german culture is still staunchly hierarchical . 
  of course , this is all relative ; german and dutch culture are naturally much closer to one another than each are to e.g. 
  arab culture , but it 's just hogwash and naivete to assume cultural differences do n't exist . 
  actually * to fuck * is a dutch loanword . 
  its etymology is derived from dutch * fokken * ( to breed ) . 
  we just borrowed it back ;-), 
  even if it * is * darn outright insulting and inflammatory - which , i 'll grant you , it is - it should still fall under freedom of speech imho . 
  * especially * when it 's about politicians . 
  republic of the united dutch provinces !, 
  still , that captain must have had balls of steel . 
  he was completely within his right to fire . 
  perhaps germans should focus less on trying to force policies on other sovereign nations , and for once be realistic : the greek debt needs to be relieved . 
  never underestimate innovation in the how-can-we-not-pay-people industry !, 
  essentially , quite some companies were legally paying more than minimum wage , but workers were contractually obliged to pay rent etc back to the employer ( whose housing was often of substandard quality etc ) , in effect meaning that said employer pays very little . 
  apart from that , even if it 's regular minimum wage , it 's often borderline unfair competition . 
  in quite some situations , working for minimum wage means a smaller paycheck than getting welfare ( and yes , that 's absurd ) - especially if one rents an apartment . 
  that therefore means minimum wage is often `` not worth it '' for dutch nationals , while minimum wage can be a pretty large sum of money - relatively speaking - for new immigrants . 
  my alma mater was `` flooded '' with greek students during the crisis . 
  now , while they do party * quite * a bit more than the native dutch counterparts - stereotype confirmed !, 
  - , most of them did comparatively very well . 
  the amount of greek drop-outs was very small . 
  potato peel can in fact be toxic . 
  especially if it 's been greening . 
  while the 50s and 60s of the previous century were n't exactly pleasant times to be gay in the western world by today 's standards , they were still miles ahead of islamic societies today . 
  discriminatory laws in the netherlands indeed existed until 1971 - the infamous [ article 248bis ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/artikel_248bis_van_het_wetboek_van_strafrecht_%28nederland%29 ) - but that was just a different age of consent . 
  a large part of western europe decriminalized homosexuality * an sich * in 1811 , thanks to the french penal code . 
  homosexuals living in islamic countries do n't just run the risk of getting shunned , discriminated , disowned , beaten , or even imprisoned . 
  no , they run the risk of being decapitated ( or stoned to death , or thrown from a tall building , or whatever 's the most popular execution method there ) . 
  the last large-scale executions of homosexuals in nl were , on the other hand , in [ 1730-1731 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/utrecht_sodomy_trials ) . 
  islamic countries are n't just homophobic ; they 're near-genocidal . 
  i ca n't say much about the uk , but considering the netherlands disability benefits are generally higher than unemployment benefits . 
  technically , unemployment benefits and disability benefits are the same ( 70 % of last earned income ) , but unemployment benefits last just a few months for most people . 
  after that , it 's general welfare , and at 900 euros a month , that 's not super duper much ( tho one gets a a lot of supplementary benefits ) . 
  that said , disability fraud is something of the past here . 
  it was very popular in the 80s and 90s as an early retirement . 
  now it requires frequent checkups by a doctor to get disability benefits . 
  gay here . 
  there 's truth in what you say , but muslims in general take it to a whole other level . 
  though raised in a catholic environment , i have yet to meet a single catholic who wants to legally ban my right to love someone . 
  at most , they want to obstruct my right to marry . 
  i do n't know of any western country that still bans homosexuality outright . 
  now take that to islam . 
  muslims will tell me straight in my face that they would like to see me in jail - or even worse . 
  a large part ( majority ? ), 
  of the muslim world is off-limits to me as i 'll be literally stoned to death there . 
  yes , western countries and societies are not saints , but they 're a lot better than islamic ones . 
  netherlands : * ** referendum ** nearly two-thirds of those that made it to the polls voted [ against ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/voting-starts-in-dutch-referendum-on-eu-ukraine-deal-1459939630 ) the ratification of the eu association treaty with the ukraine . 
  turnout , at 32 % , was low but legally sufficient . 
  * ** politics ** justice minister [ ad van der steur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ard_van_der_steur ) survived a [ vote of no confidence ] ( http://www.nltimes.nl/2016/04/08/justice-min-survives-debate-on-brussels-attacks/ ) . 
  he has made serious mistakes before , but the [ ( mis - ) communications failure ] ( http://www.nltimes.nl/2016/03/31/pressure-mounting-on-justice-min-ard-van-der-steur/ ) with belgian and turkish authorities surrounding the brussels terrorists was the final straw for a large part of the opposition . 
  a major reason why some opposition parties did not support the motion is the seeming lack of possible replacements . 
  the justice department has already seen the departure of a minister and undersecretary during this government term . 
  * ** panama papers ** several dutch companies have been implicated in the panama papers scandal . 
  one of the tax-evasion routes that mossack fonseca used/uses runs through the netherlands ( e.g. 
  the dutch sandwich route or the caribbean route ) . 
  corruption in south-american soccer organization conmebol was made possible through a [ dutch company reselling broadcasting rights ] ( https://panamapapers.nl/#!het-balletje-rolt-via-nederland ) . 
  furthermore , a charity has come [ under fire ] ( https://panamapapers.nl/#!het-panamese-labyrint-van-solidaridad ) for using a network of offshore companies . 
  the first dutch `` victim '' of the panama papers has been [ bert meerstadt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bert_meerstadt ) - former president of the dutch railways - who [ resigned ] ( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abn-amro-board-member-meerstadt-115353047.html ) from the advisory boards of both abn amro bank and bols ( liquors/spirits ) . 
  leftist parties in parliament called for an [ investigation ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2098353-kamermeerderheid-achter-mini-enquete-na-panama-papers.html ) to be opened into the panama papers , a move which seems to be supported by a majority . 
  edit : added english-language source for vote of no confidence . 
  added sentence about parliament opening investigations into panama papers . 
  you 're having the moral high ground here by fighting back through official channels . 
  what year is it currently ? 
  nearing end game ? 
  roasted pork . 
  yum !, 
  i 'm a big proponent of direct democracy , but a 30 % turnout is just appalling for democracy . 
  ah yeah , [ dumping ] ( http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/960/buitenland/article/detail/513121/2008/11/27/franse-werknemers-vervuilen-maas-opzettelijk.dhtml ) toxins in a river that millions of people rely on for potable water is such a good idea !, 
  shell is technically british/dutch . 
  for a `` purely '' dutch brand i 'd say phillips . 
  after much consideration , i 'll be voting in favor tomorrow . 
  that 's not without reservations , but the interviews by the organizers of the referendum last weekend have really left a sour taste in my mouth . 
  i wo n't watch anything that 's dubbed . 
  original language , please !,
