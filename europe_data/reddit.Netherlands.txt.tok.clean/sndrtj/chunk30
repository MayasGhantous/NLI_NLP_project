  note , the sp are not social democrats , but more hardline left . 
  like die linke in germany , they arose from a former communist party . 
  * the cda ( quasi-christian centre-right ) are calling for an [ increased electoral treshold ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2152950-cda-wil-hogere-kiesdrempel-en-meer-geld-defensie.html ) . 
  the current threshold is 0.75 % , which is the amount needed for 1 seat in parliament . 
  politics has been fracturing the last decade , with more and more mini-parties and breakaway fractions appearing . 
  it is worth noting that status does _ not _ apply to dutch companies . 
  it only generally only applies to multinationals . 
  clickbaity headline . 
  we have general elections in just two months ; the labour party where mr asscher belongs to is polling at its lowest point ever with less than 10 % of the vote . 
  it very likely will not participate in the new government . 
  i hate it when they dub it like that . 
  can we have the video with the original audio and just subtitles ? 
  i 'm extremely skeptical whether any scandal can be big enough for this man to resign . 
  the entire election campaign was going from one scandal to the next , and in stead of hurting him , he manages to spin everything to his advantage . 
  you tried that two times . 
  did n't exactly work out , did it ? 
  check the [ pressure forecast ] ( https://www.windytv.com/?pressure,2017-01-20-12,48.430,7.892,4 ) at windity . 
  it 's projecting a high pressure area extending all the way from vladivostok to greenland to even canada - and not via the short route .

  what is it with religions and their obsession with sex ? 
  actually , catholics have the highest rate of [ effective irreligiousity ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nr/rdonlyres/20ec6e0b-b87a-4cfe-818b-579fb779009f/0/20140209b15art.pdf ) ( report by the cbs ; table 3.1.1 . 
  see % never visiting church ) . 
  the difference is numbers is due to the fact it was ridiculously complicated to officially _ leave _ the catholic church until quite recently . 
  the process involved having to send letters to as many as six different organizations , and even the church might have decided it ecumenically impossible . 
  the catholic church is very good at keeping track of its members , which the rag-tag collection of various protestants streams is n't good at ( or does n't do at all ) . 
  that 's why you see more % of _ registered _ catholics these days then registered protestants . 
  many irreligious people are _ registered _ as catholic because it was nigh impossible to leave until a few years ago . 
  it is further complicated by the [ constitutional right ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/artikel_23_van_de_nederlandse_grondwet ) to establish faith schools . 
  some history is inescapable here . 
  back when education became a government policy in the late 18th and early 19th century , government-funded education was in principle secular and based on french ideals . 
  the church ( both protestants and catholics ) did n't like that , and sought to receive state funding for faith schools as well . 
  essentially the entire 19th century was then mired in conflict between those who wanted public funding for faith schools , and those who wanted state funding to keep secular : the [ school struggle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school_struggle_\\ ( netherlands \\ ) ) . 
  in the end , there was some sort of compromise : everyone is allowed to establish a school with their favorite religious or philosophical underpinnings , and receive public money for it . 
  such schools are called [ `` special schools '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_school_\\ ( netherlands \\ ) ) . 
  the majority of elementary schools are such schools . 
  now , that makes it constitutionally difficult to ban diyanet-founded schools . 
  germany is still on a similar system than we had before 2005 . 
  there is public healthcare , and private health care once one earns a certain amount of money ( iirc , it 's often paid straight out of your salary in germany ) . 
  private insurance can be ridiculously expensive ( from a dutch pov ) , but does give perks . 
  health care providers often only provide services to the publicly insured , or the privately insured - tho i 'm unsure whether that applies to hospitals as well .

  spoken like a true dutchman !, 
   even saw a couple of people in little electric chairs going around , which was surprising to say the least you do n't have them in spain ? 
  they are ubiquitous in nl for the elderly . 
  i do n't think that 's up to society to decide . 
  only the 90-year old lady herself can decide about that . 
  you guys finally going to fix nrw 's roads ? 
  because you are not consuming enough products . 
  germany consuming more would likely increase the gdp of the world ; including italy . 
  possession of marijuana is legal , but production definitely is n't . 
  it 's not usually prosecuted against home growers , but cultivating marijuana is a criminal act and can be punished with a prison sentence of up to 2 years by [ article 11 ] ( http://wetten.overheid.nl/bwbr0001941/2013-07-01#artikel11 ) of the opium law . 
  given our history of sending the most cringy things out there , i could imagine us sending a `` sat\u00e9saus met bami '' song . 
   long dutch debate ah yeah , the everyone-must-give-his / her-opinion-and-that-includes-the-janitor-going-into-insane-details thing . 
  i wish we could get to the point quicker . 
  with six internal committees . 
   self-deprecating humor gets lost the most . 
  oh , god , that 's so true . 
  it 's like many are physically unable to contemplate the fact someone can make a stingy joke about themselves . 
  the national policy is likely to change soon . 
  decriminalizing and regulating soft drugs completely is supported by a large majority of the population . 
  the party blocking most of that recently [ changed ] ( http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/39683/nbsp/article/detail/4418881/2016/11/21/vvd-overstag-toch-legale-wietteelt.dhtml ) its position , and is now too in favor of decriminalizing and regulating soft drugs . 
  since we have elections in two months , this current parliament wo n't do much anymore , but the upcoming government will likely decriminalize it . 
  marijuana is not and never was decriminalized . 
  production of it is still illegal , tho mostly tolerated : aka not actively prosecuted . 
  it 's different . 
  security in israel is at malls , train stations , that kind of thing . 
  most religious places are completely unguarded ( most synagogues in israel are tiny ; you 'd think they were a regular house if you did n't know otherwise ) , schools are just like anywhere else in the world . 
  there exists a mathematical point in time where everyone _ must _ be related to everyone . 
  iirc , the number of generations back in time to reach that point is ridiculously small . 
  so china had its own crisis of the third century when it broke up into three pieces ? 
  is that the end of the similarity with the roman world in that century , or is there more to it ? 
  do gardening shops typically sell ammunition over there ?

  from hearing their speech in limburgish , i can often determine the exact town people were raised in .

  that accent !, 
  with astana having longtitude ( 71 degrees east ) similar to islamabad , pakistan ( 73 degrees east ) , i think it 's fair to say kazahstan is not in europe . 
  hre , i 'm guessing .

  what 's the length of day there in january ? 
  been thinking the same thing a while ago .

  ** netherlands ** * the annual national fireworks debate reached its climax on new year 's eve . 
  five eyes had to be surgically removed , 16 people became blind in at least one eye , 1 hand had to be amputated and the total number of amputated fingers amounted to 25 . 
  while initial reports were that he had to be reanimated by colleagues who were bombed with fireworks by bystanders , reality turned out to be slightly different : he did n't have to be reanimated , and ambulance personnel was n't firebombed ( but other police officers cordoning off the street were ) . 
  latest reports are that the officer is still on [ intensive care ] ( http://www.metronieuws.nl/nieuws/binnenland/2017/01/agenten-die-mario-hielpen-werden-niet-aangevallen ) in the hospital . 
  * a german ship missed a turn in heavy fog and [ crashed ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/12/30/waterpeil-maas-daalt-na-botsing-schip-met-brug-bij-grave-a1538906 ) into a weir on the river maas . 
  since the natural water level of the maas fluctuates too heavily to guarantee it 's navigable year-round , a system of 7 weirs regulates the water level in the southern part of its course through the netherlands ( [ video of how that works ] ( http://nos.nl/video/2151182-hoe-werken-de-stuwen-en-sluizen-in-de-maas.html ) ) . 
  the 6th weir is now broken . 
  this has caused the water level to drop up to 3m in the section of river immediately upstream of the weir , with the lowest level near the 5th weir . 
  this is endangering a cluster of houseboats , who are now so heavily slanted they are at [ risk of sinking ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2150892-maas-zakt-verder-situatie-woonboten-nijpend.html ) . 
  shipping is severely affected , as a detour all the way via antwerp is now required . 
  ado and mr wang have an ongoing dispute about payments mr wang ostensibly should have made . 
  after being legally ousted from the board a few weeks ago , the courts now ruled he has to transfer ado 2.4 million euros as of immediate effect .
