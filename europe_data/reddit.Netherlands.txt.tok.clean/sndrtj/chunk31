  if ado does n't receive the money by 1 february , that could mean it looses its license for the eredivisie ( the national league ) , since that 'd mean it 'd have no budget . 
  union of utrecht ftw !, 
  not disputing the not europe thing , but ... 
  it has a population density the same as the netherlands ( within the green line ) , a space program , several renowned scientific institutions ( technion and weizmann institute , among others ) , is practically a member of the eu when it comes down to science money , is a member of the un since decades , has the most developed society in the entire levant etc. 
  if that 's not a country , what is ? 
  i never heard about this , but this sounds hilarious . 
  any source ? 
  to be honest , i quite dislike a limburgish accent in dutch . 
  and for some reason tv always manages to find the most * facepalm * persons . 
  but . . reverse accent mocking :d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjhm7dbhtmo, 
  limburgs has something [ similar ] ( https://nl.wiktionary.org/wiki/wikiwoordenboek:tonaliteit_in_het_limburgs ) . 
  * eine stein -  `` stein '' is strechted and goes down in tone ( one stone ) . 
  * twie stein -  `` stein '' is short , and stays flat in tone ( two stones ) . 
  of course they had to shorten the 25 years to something much smaller . 
  of course they had to change his personality . 
  it 's a dramatized hollywood-esque action _ movie _ , not a 7-part documentary . 
  a story that spans 25 years works well in the written word . 
  it generally does n't on the black screen . 
  i did n't say it told history perfectly . 
  but in the _ context of a dramatized action movie _ it does a rather good job , imho . 
  definitely . 
  i think it has to do with the fact we have to make them with low budgets . 
  that means no massive cast , fewer and/or smaller filming locations etc. 
  for dramas and coming-of-age movies , that makes them all the more realistic . 
  because regular life - what these movies are about - happens in regular locations . 
  whereas the americans are obsessed with wealth , and screaming dialog ; something that works well for action movies , but less so for dramas . 
  another european non-sexual movie : [ cowboys and angels ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377701/ ) . 
  not strictly lgbt-only ( main character is straight ) , but imho a very nice watch . 
  then i remember watching an english lgbt-coming-of-age movie set in a low-class suburb of london years ago , but i ca n't remember its name . 
  edit : found it . 
  [ beautiful thing ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115640/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ), 
  did n't know about jongens . 
  does it have anything new to offer to the gay coming-of-age movie ? 
  the pics on imdb make it look more than just reminiscent of sommersturm . 
  as for dutch-language gay films , i really liked [ noordzee , texas ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1625150/ ) . 
  finally a gay movie without half-naked bodies everywhere . 
  bit of a tearjerker tho . 
  [ michiel de ruyter ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2544766/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) is suprisingly good for a dutch movie , and fairly historically accurate . 
  then there 's also [ zwartboek ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389557/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) , a fictional story about a jewish girl joining the resistance during wwii and ending up having an affair with a highly-ranked german officer . 
  i did n't know this . 
  very useful to know when traveling !, 
  what exactly do n't you get ? 
  what does _ de misdrijven _ refer to in that sentence ? 
  crimes committed in/at schools , or the crime of preventing someone to go to school or set up their own school ? 
  so your kid passes out when you left it in the cold for 15 hours , and no , nothing weird with that ? 
  those people should n't be parents . 
  could you do one for netherlands ? 
  suspects by ethnicity can be found [ here ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=81959ned&amp;d1=2&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=a&amp;d5=0&amp;d6=14-15&amp;vw=t ) from the central bureau of statistics . 
  what is epc ? 
  berlin ? 
  hilarious post , thanks op . 
  well , my experience the s-bahn and bvg after having having lived in berlin can indeed by summarized by : au\u00dfer betrieb . 
  not that public transport in my current place of residence is any better , tho . 
   but it seems to be that it is acceptable or at least without consequences in germany to execute orders coming from a higher level germany is a pretty hierarchic society , which is even greater in corporate culture , so that 's definitely a possibility . 
  both tegel and sch\u00f6nefeld are horribly outdated , not to mention tiny . 
  berlin , as it stands , does not have a `` proper '' international airport . 
  for the capital city of europe 's largest economy , that 's at least somewhat odd . 
  so whichever one is _ actually _ right ? 
  both silicon valley and silicon wadi nations being so low ? 
  why ? 
  obviously , but that does n't mean one should n't be allowed to question the sanity of said red tape . 
  not entirely sure how the process goes , but i could imagine it entailing having to apply with some form , _ then _ having to send / deliver the passport . 
  if her dad died in the meantime , that would present a problem . 
   secondly , you can get your documents back 10 working days after the application process starts this is still ridiculously long . 
  one should be able to make an appointment at the immigration office , and have it copied / read ( there 's a chip in those things ) on the spot - of course for a price . 
  if an airport clerk can verify your passport with the click of a button , the immigration office should definitely be able to . 
   one thing i am curious about is , does the netherlands have a national id ? 
  because they would accept that as well . 
  we do , but in her situation , she likely would n't be able to acquire one . 
  dutch embassies only issue passports . 
  id cards are only issued at a city office , and since she has been living in the uk for 24 years , she is likely no longer registered at any city . 
  can macedonia sue the embassy back for intentional wrongful litigation ? 
  the stated reason was because her dad died . 
  i think that falls within the realm of `` beyond your control '' . 
  not carrying a passport or drivers license is an offense in the netherlands . 
  it concerns having to _ surrender _ your passport for weeks , if not months . 
  obviously this presents huge problems for those having the identify themselves for other purposes ( such as having to cross borders because your dad died ) . 
  the having-to-surrender-your-passport-for-weeks requirements of the uk are just ridiculous . 
  i once had an indian colleague who was married to an italian girl . 
  his italian wife worked in london . 
  just to visit her for a weekend , he had to surrender his passport to the uk consulate in frankfurt - the embassy in the hague evidently does n't process such applications - for about a month . 
  obviously this a problem : it meant having to live in nl as a migrant worker _ without any official identification documents _ , which is illegal . 
  not to mention the crossing-borders thing . 
  why the consulate ca n't just make a photocopy , or read the contents of the embedded microchip , is beyond me . 
  every year , on the 27th of december , i have a get-together with some old friends , where we 'll continue christmas in a way . 
  this year it 's my turn to be the host , and we 'll be doing ` gourmetten ' . 
  [ gourmetten ] ( https://dutchcommunity.com/2013/11/27/gourmetten-a-deliciously-dutch-culinary-phenomenon/ ) is a style of ` cooking ' that is highly popular in the netherlands for parties , and particularly for christmas . 
  essentially it 's an indoor barbecue , except that there 's not one person responsible for cooking , but _ everyone _ has their own mini-pan . 
  the machine used looks like [ this ] ( http://wanmolen.nl/sites/default/files/gourmet.jpg ) . 
  for those familiar with swiss cuisine , it 's the same machine used for raclette . 
  gourmetten necessarily involves a lot of miniaturized meats ( or veggie patties ) , and insane amounts of sliced baguette and garlic butter . 
  it 's not particularly _ fancy _ cuisine , but it 's very [ gezellig ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gezelligheid ) , and kids ( if involved ) usually love it because they can cook their own meals !, 
  now , apart from that feeding frenzy , my family has a bit of an odd christmas food tradition : we make dozens of [ saucijzenbroodjes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/saucijzenbroodje.jpg ) , which i will also be making today . 
  the name might be translated as `` sausage buns '' , but that 's a bit of misnomer - and the literal translation _ worstenbroodje _ indeed means something different - : it 's puff-pastry filled with meatball . 
  the supermarket varieties are disgusting cardboard stuff , but they 're lovely when home made . 
  ** saucijzenbroodje recipe ( for 10 buns ) ** * puff pasty , 10 pieces * 400gr mixed pork/beef minced meat * 100gr beef minced meat * 2 eggs * bread crumbs * salt & pepper * ( optionally some nutmeg . 
  not my favorite ) meat should be from the butcher ; supermarket meat is too shitty . 
  mix meat with one of the eggs , and add salt and pepper to taste . 
  slowly mix bread crumbs until the whole thing has the consistency of meat ball . 
  then knead roughly thumb-sized sausages from the mix .
