  in the meantime , pre-heat the oven at 180-200c . 
  get your puff pastry leaves from the freezer , and lay them on a flat surface . 
  let them thaw until they 're just foldable . 
  do n't let them thaw completely . 
  put each sausage you made on every leaf , and fold over . 
  press the edges . 
  cut three small ridges on the top , so the air can expand in the oven . 
  whisk the last egg . 
  with a food brush , cover the buns in egg mixture , so they 'll get a nice glossy golden-brown cover . 
  put in the oven , until they 're golden-brown ( usually about 20 minutes ) . 
  let cool down . 
  just before serving , heat again in the oven for 10 minutes . 
  not attracted to women , but objectively , yes , she 's pretty in a sophisticated way . 
  awesome list !, 
  most handsome guy on there : atlanto mediterranid . 
  and that br\u00fcnn : cuteness overload !, 
  hahaha ... 
  there 's a lot of poles in the area where i live , and if i look on grindr , several ones look exactly like that !, 
  i 'm quite ok with the lack of hair ( do n't like men with long hair ) , but cigarette _ must _ go and _ please _ dress better !, 
  wtf , netherlands ? 
  best-looking ones : sweden , germany and turkey ( only one that manages a smile ! ), 
  i do n't have particularly warm feelings for russia post-mh17 , but people celebrating death are just disgusting . 
  the people on that flight were people , just that , no matter their political convictions or whatsoever . 
  / r/news and / r/worldnews are filled with narrative-pushing anyway . 
  my realization came when / r/news started deleting hordes of valid comments and threads concerning the orlando shooting because the identity of the shooter did n't fit the mods ' narrative , and / r/askreddit ( of all places ! ), 
  was the only default subreddit where it was still possible to discuss the event . 
  there 's a big hannukiah on the top of a hotel next to the a2 in maastricht . 
  is there one for guys ? 
  that 's mostly because size . 
  tallest people on the planet , you know . 
  what the hell , iceland ? 
  though in german ` still ' is not just limited to sound . 
  it still has the meaning of `` inactive '' ( like in english ) as well , whereas in dutch that meaning has been lost . 
  ` not doing so good ' is an understatement . 
  they have the [ worst labor participation rates ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2015/31/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand ) . 
  aka 70 % of them are in the bijstand . 
  this is a problem of labels . 
  people forget africa is _ huge _ . 
  ` african ' ethnicity does n't exist . 
  as for somalis and eritreans , they have the absolute worst labor participation rates here . 
  no integration whatsoever , tho the problems they cause are usually limited to petty thievery . 
  til there is a favorites list option there . 
  what does `` stronzo '' mean ? 
  it sounds similar to dutch `` stront '' , aka a vulgar word for excrement . 
  the long and short vowel rules absolutely make sense . 
  they 're extremely regular , and just match pronunciation . 
  english does n't have such a rule at all , with spelling that does n't reflect pronunciation at all . 
  german tries to solve the same problem by sticking an h to the vowel when a long vowel is required ( e.g. 
  `` ohr '' vs dutch `` oor '' ) , but the rules for that are less clear . 
  as for the compound word rules , i 'm going to assume you 're talking about the tussen-n . 
  in that case , yes , the new rules are just stupid ( `` paardenbloem '' makes so much more sense than the official `` paardebloem '' ), 
  then at least do it in a way that makes sense !, 
  _ j _ either starts a syllable , follows _ i _ in vowels ( _ ij _ being a diphthong ) , or exists at the final syllable denoting a diminutive ( _ ~ tje _ , _ ~ sje _ , _ ~ kje _ ) . 
  and the dutch cognate to german _ ~ ung _ is _ ~ ing _ . 
  might get your stereotypes better next time ;-) . 
  it would be `` eindoplossing '' in any case , and that sounds really boring . 
  `` eindlosing '' would mean `` final dump '' , which sounds like you 're taking the last shit of your life . 
  that 's assuming we would have re-constructed in the same way as the brd did . 
  we would have probably done it differently . 
  better ? 
  no way to know . 
  our grammar at least makes sense . 
  no akkusativ !, 
  genetiv only in archaic sentences !, 
  yay for simplicity !, 
  both _ ui _ and _ ij _ are diphthongs possibly unique to dutch . 
  and words ending in k are not common in western europe . 
  aachen has miraculously shifted south ? 
  definitely less erratic than here . 
  i actually lived a in berlin for a year during my studies , and that winter regularly saw temperatures of -10 to -15 until deep in march . 
  and although that was a [ harsh winter for berlin standards ] ( http://notrickszone.com/2013/03/22/berlin-freezes-in-100-year-winter-record-snow-blankets-germany-bitter-cold-grips-europe/#sthash.nycbcfdg.dpbs ) , it definitely was a bit too chilly for me :p . also , love the fact that we 're now exchanging weather forecast with random strangers across the continent . 
  well , today 's been +7 . 
  our weather is as erratic as donald trump 's twitter feed . 
  christmas will be +10 -11 , with no decrease in the night , but henceforth most weather models predict more [ wintery conditions ] ( https://www.knmi.nl/nederland-nu/weer/waarschuwingen-en-verwachtingen/ensemble-verwachting-detail ) ( select `` maastricht ( beek ) '' from the dropdown menu , and hit `` toon '' . 
  lower left panel is temperature ) , with a possible ice-day ( subzero throughout the day ) on thursday . 
  i 'd say -5 is absolutely common . 
  -10 during the night is a few-times-a-year event . 
  subzero temperatures throughout the day are less common , and a year might go by without any such days , but most winters have several . 
  but below -10 , and the chance of that happening goes down rapidly . 
  -15 is once every few years or so . 
  average low temperature in january and february is [ around freezing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maastricht#climate ) ( note : weather station is on a hill ; temperatures in the city ( in a valley ) are usually slightly higher in summer , and slightly lower in winter ) . 
  so sub-zero temperatures are n't uncommon ; tho lower than -10 is less common . 
  the last time we had freezing temperatures was the day before yesterday , with a minimum of -3 . 
  temperatures around -20 are a once-in-a-generation thing . 
  last time that happened was in [ february 2012 ] ( https://www.knmi.nl/nederland-nu/klimatologie/maand-en-seizoensoverzichten/2012/februari ) , with a low of -22.9 . 
  the jet stream has been behaving weirdly this year . 
  essentially there 's been this massive meander that brought warm air all the way up to northern greenland , whereas siberia got the downflow of bitter arctic air . 
  that 's entirely in line with global warming . 
  the jet stream is powered by the temperature difference between the poles and mid-latitudes . 
  the polar regions have been warming faster than elsewhere , which means that difference is getting smaller , hence a weaker jet stream . 
  i already find -15 god awful . 
  absolutely do n't want to experience -30 , and i 'm sure i 'd be dead at -60 . 
  lone wolves do exist . 
  especially when they use commonly available tools like this , it 's actually pretty easy to do an attack without any help . 
  the term `` moderate islam '' already says enough . 
  just the fact that we need to slap on a `` moderate '' label for normal behavior , means that _ actual _ islam is a violence cult . 
  based on what we now know ; that the driver who drove through the christmas market is a refugee of either afghani or pakistani origin , i 'm afraid the polish guy is no longer alive . 
  he was either taken hostage , and is the co-driver who ended up dead , or he was murdered by the perpetrator beforehand when stealing the truck . 
  dutch-language article [ here ] ( http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/957/binnenland/article/detail/3034912/2016/12/19/politie-en-militairen-voeren-grootse-actie-uit-in-schaarbeek-maar-zou-niet-om-terrorisme-gaan.dhtml ) . 
  it 's not clear if it has to do with terrorism , but one person was arrested , and an explosives removal squad was called .
