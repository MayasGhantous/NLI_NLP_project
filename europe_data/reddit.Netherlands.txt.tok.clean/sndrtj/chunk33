  n-tv seems to think it was hired in poland because it 's easier to hire a truck in poland than in germany . 
  i had n't even heard of that first one . 
  christ . 
  ard is currently still airing a quiz , but there was a news ticker for a while a few minutes ago that said `` suspected attack in berlin ; at least one dead '' . 
  how come only dutch media seem to be airing the video ? 
  if russia decides to retaliate we might have an article 5 situation at hand . 
  are `` town '' and `` street '' linguistically related to each other in turkish ? 
  other redditor thought he said streets . 
  excitement is n't necessarily a positive term . 
  the us already did . 
  geenstijl and associated media regularly do . 
  yes , he 's one of the most active politicians on facebook . 
  i once messaged him there , thinking i would n't get a reply , but he in fact did . 
  which is why i prefer to buy from the butcher , rather than the supermarket . 
  just a shame that butchers have become so hard to find . 
  slaughtering your own pig would be illegal here , tho i do know some people who occasionally do so . 
  notorious lawbreaker ? 
  some dutch media mock him for being . . well ... large . 
  and he is often a bit too emotional for our down-to-earth politics . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcgcbhnckyi ) , when he was still minister of foreign affairs in the netherlands , is possibly the very first speech by a dutch politician in this century that actually made some lasting impression on me ( even tho some things said there turned out to be factually wrong , afterwards ) . 
  7 , if you include his native limburgs . 
  the article explains exactly that . 
  it does , say , however , that most of these teachers are paid for by the german state . 
  the link he posted seems to be reasonable , tho . 
  it 's a website which proclaims to promote a politically diverse discussion in academics . 
  i do n't think you can find much wrong with that . 
  this website does n't look the most trustworthy ever . 
  is there a better source ? 
  the fact that even reuters has these `` sponsored stories '' on the bottom of the page , with 100 % clickbait fake news ( `` 15 shocking star revelations !, 
  '' , `` the weight loss trick they wo n't tell you about ! '' ), 
  just shocked me . 
  it 's like they 've sold themselves to the devil . 
  that has a pretty strong bias towards the democrats and progressivism in general . 
  while i 'd say their articles are usually well written indeed , exclusively reading those two is going to get you stuck in a bubble . 
  it 's a bit self-bloat from the author : `` look , we 've published this article , and please take over all our recommendations because they 're going to fix everything '' . 
  and this is where the left and right dichotomy breaks down . 
  on an economic level , ft is definitely right-wing . 
  but on social issues they 're progressivists . 
  jeez , man . 
  do you get the concept of satire ? 
  it 's supposed to be blunt . 
  tiny dick , eh ? 
  i meant the ngo with ` amnesty ' ;-) . 
  but yes , amnesty/pardon is possible . 
  the king can do so , but it is extremely rare . 
  which is _ exactly _ what i 'm saying . 
  that 's my exact point : nl and de seem to have different interpretation of what life imprisonment should * be * , which explains the different rates ( and , yes , likely the preventative detention rate in germany is similar to the dutch life imprisonment rate ) . 
  2000 vs a few dozen is a way larger difference than can be explained by population size ( germany is roughly 5x the netherlands ) . 
  i assumed that to be obvious and yes , that preventative matters is exactly what life imprisonment is about in nl . 
  i 'm not going to trust any polls except for the ones that actually matter : the elections themselves . 
  so life imprisonment is n't exclusively for the worst of the worst in germany then . 
  and herein probably lies the difference between our countries : life imprisonment in the netherlands , as a punishment , is reserved for the worst of the worst criminals . 
  we also find this back in the figures . 
  as per wikipedia , the amount of germans with a life imprisonment is [ over 2000 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/lebenslange_freiheitsstrafe#deutsches_strafrecht ) . 
  in the netherlands , this is only a [ few dozen ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/lijst_van_tot_levenslang_veroordeelden_in_nederland ) . 
  and our background crime rate is n't all that different . 
  the term justice often involves some form of revenge . 
  * justice is served * nearly invariably involves revenge . 
  one is n't allowed to make a joke ? 
  thanks . 
  of course . 
  but cases exist where rehabilitation is impossible . 
  there still is a chance to be _ released _ , just not paroled . 
  the king can pardon people . 
  alas , that is extremely rare , and usually only happens when the convict in question is dying . 
  as for miscarriages of justice , the ruling can of course be overturned . 
  prime recent example would be [ lucia de berk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lucia_de_berk ) . 
  revenge is a part of the legal system . 
  sometimes they definitely [ have ] ( http://www.ad.nl/nieuws/moeder-3-kinderen-dood-na-fatale-crash-spookrijder-87~a1375015/ ) to , yes . 
  can someone corroborate this with sources ? 
  but such mistakes are guaranteed to happen . 
  no matter how many safeguards are in place , there will one day be a mistake . 
  in the netherlands life imprisonment is literally for life . 
  there is no chance of parole . 
  only the king can technically pardon convicts , but this is extremely rare and has n't happened in over a decade . 
  i 'm glad we have _ actual _ life imprisonment , with no chance of any parole ever . 
  amnesty might not like it , but some people need to be kept off the streets forever . 
  but why ca n't we build an island in eu territorial waters , that functions as the processing center . 
  japan would refuse entry , and then no one would bat an eye because `` oh . 
  it 's just their culture , and they want to keep it that way '' , and that 's be fine because they 're not western and therefore the media wo n't target them . 
  for the netherlands : boats . 
  because we invented plattenbau . 
  it 's the commies who took that over from the dutch , not the other way around . 
  not / s. 
  it 's true . 
  considerably , to a certain degree . 
  they can especially play the immigrant victim card , while the media is extremely sensitive towards this . 
  their success story already is zwarte piet . 
  then , if they are able to mobilize their target group , things could quickly go out of hand . 
  we 've already had riots in the hague a while ago , because of this essentially . 
  at high dosages _ everything _ is a poison and can kill . 
  you can die from drinking too much water . 
  and yet again the taxpayer ends up paying for banking faults . 
  companies that are not profitable should fail , plain and simple . 
  a currency union without a fiscal union is a dead end . 
  it can not end well . 
  there must eventually be a fiscal union . 
  the current ecb policy can also be * very * good for northern countries . 
  your government is borrowing money with negative interest rates now ; it gets * paid * to fund itself . 
  negative bond rates in europe only exist in the north .
