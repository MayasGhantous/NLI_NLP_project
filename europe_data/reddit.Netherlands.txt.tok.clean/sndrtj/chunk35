  60 % is still rather abysmal . 
  young people are now a minority in most western countries . 
  it becomes increasingly * less * logical for political parties to cater to young people : the demographic is shrinking * and * their participation rate is considerably smaller than older generations . 
  want to stay in power as a political party ? 
  cater to the old . 
  young people are the problem . 
  they do n't vote . 
  wordpress is the most popular blog software out there . 
  a lot of real news outlets run on it as well ( e.g. 
  saying wordpress is like cancer is like saying the printing press is cancer because it allowed demagogues to print their books . 
  the monument is a bit of a failure imho . 
  it nearly always devolves into ` catch me if you can ' thing , and the amount of profile pictures on tinder with the monument as a background really does n't fit to something that should commemorate the deaths of over 6 million people . 
  it 's not supposed to be fun . 
  dutch also has the polish one : * mosterd na de maaltijd * . 
  these days : approx 12 . 
  yeah , i 'm afraid the us is on track for something similar right now . 
  one single big terror attack , and it 's enabling act 2016 . 
  oddly , though , there is a large israeli community in berlin these days . 
  tho i do guess it 's mostly a certain kind of people : most israelis i 've met in berlin are meretz-supporters , or at least left-leaning . 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  next thing they 're going to create a hotline when someone yawns too often . 
  65 % of high school pupils in amsterdam are not dutch . 
  i live in a city where dutch form a 40-something percent _ plurality _ , but no longer a majority , and that percentage is [ dropping ] ( http://www.denhaag.nl/web/file?uuid=886fda46-308c-45bf-a737-4d064b3c88a0&amp;owner=a4f2d81f-58f2-4e5a-b7ab-1ea88b24f755 ) . 
  the demographic decline of europeans is definitely real ; in the not too far future only `` provincial '' areas will still be native . 
  good . 
  we need more spending on defense . 
  lets replace _ tanks _ with _ implodes _ . 
  he himself might not be really anti-gay , but is entire entourage is . 
  mike pence sought to [ imprison ] ( https://www.queerty.com/mike-pences-seven-viscously-homophobic-moments-theres-lot-choose-20160720 ) gay couples seeking a marriage license . 
  only out of spite . 
  and there 's a lot of spite in american politics right now . 
  well ... if the economy tanks , co2 emissions will also go down . 
  so , actually , from a climate pov , it might not be such a bad thing . 
  and if you preserve any 150 year old building in perpeteum , you can never re-develop anything . 
  we [ invented ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/nirwana-flat ) plattenbau . 
  could be any suburb of a dutch city , were it better maintained . 
  i 'm not as anti-modern architecture as most of this sub , but even for me : oh god , why ? 
  it 's just a matter of time until the next one . 
  the netherlands definitely is more in line with the uk than germany , at least on foreign policy lines . 
  and i would argue nl is economically definitely more anglo-saxon than central europe is . 
  the general german mindset is too controlling for our liking . 
  we 're a trading nation . 
  that 's why . 
  we have always preferred low tariffs and little borders to trade . 
  trade is what makes nl nl . 
  i 'm surprised we are still in the middle of the wanted brexit hardiness scale . 
  we 'll loose one of our best buddies on the foreign policy front , and we do relatively a lot of trade with the uk . 
  europe is much more blaz\u00e9 about iran than the us is . 
  when the sanctions were lifted , airbus made a huge deal with iran in effectively no time ( which means it was pre-arranged ) . 
  that is indeed exactly the problem . 
  it 's not a well-thought out system . 
  essentially , it 's a huge compromise from the 1970s , which was never modernized . 
  production must indeed come from somewhere , and this means cannabis plantations are everywhere . 
  approximately 6,000 of them are [ seized and destroyed ] ( https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nederland/vorig-jaar-16-wietplantages-dag-opgerold-maar-er-zijn-nog-veel-meer ) by the authorities every year , with that number likely being the tip of the iceberg . 
  i personally have had neighbors who grew the stuff in their attic . 
  the unregulated production gives rise to two major issues : 1 ) production is largely in criminal hands , a sizable fraction of which is organized crime . 
  most cities in the south - where the problem is worst - want to regulate the business - but this is met by sometimes fierce opposition from local crime rings . 
  we 've had mayors [ who had to go into hiding ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/202233-burgemeester-helmond-ondergedoken.html ) and a town hall was once [ destroyed by arson ] ( https://www.metronieuws.nl/nieuws/2012/07/grote-brand-in-gemeentehuis-waalre-na-aanslag ) in a suspected drugcrime-related attack . 
  2 ) all those unregulated plantations , often in people 's houses , present a huge fire risk . 
  the stupidity of the law is even recognized by the legal system . 
  in 2014 , a couple who had a plantage out of principle ( and declared the sales as income on their tax statements ) was prosecuted , but [ ruled guilty , without any punishment ] ( http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/3905054/rechter-geeft-twee-principiele-wietkwekers-geen-straf.html ) by the judge . 
  the judge basically held the law to be impossible to uphold . 
  we 've actually had some quabbles with our western friends over our cannabis policies . 
  i guess the fact that we 're an eu founder helps us out here . 
  and also , if you want to go into the nitty gritty details : while the _ sale _ of cannabis is permitted , the _ production _ is not ( caveat emptor : up to 5 plants/person _ is _ allowed , but that is n't enough to satisfy demand , obviously ) . 
  that means that production facilities are in possession of huge crime syndicates , with especially brabant slowly turning into mafialand . 
  looks like he 's not even wearing underwear in that pic . 
  i don ' t think that is comparable , at all . 
  flanders and the netherlands have excellent relations . 
  i grew up near the border ; while there obviously is some sense of separation , i know a considerable amount of dutch people who went to school just across the border in belgium , and vice versa . 
  as a fellow gay : how is it to be gay in turkey ? 
  i perosnally do n't dare to go to any muslim majority nations ; is that fear warranted ? 
  you linked the wrong graph . 
  let 's view the [ deficit ] ( https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-deficit.htm#indicator-chart ) in stead of percent of gdp spend on government . 
  from 2000 to 2016 , greece consistently had one of the worst deficits in the oecd . 
  before 2016 , it never even managed to get above -4 % . 
  it never met the eu fiscal compliance of max -3 % until last year . 
  actually , that 's a fairly decent blog . 
  however , it 's _ very _ opinionated so one ca n't use it as an objective source of information . 
  while extremely low , you guys still [ have debt ] ( http://www.nationaldebtclocks.org/debtclock/estonia ), 
  not again ... :-(, 
  i once send a package to the us , and it was apparently completely taken apart , then re-stitched together in a completely botched way . 
  essentially it became a basket of duct tape . 
  now , it did n't contain anything fragile or valuable , but i would really hesitate to send anything to the us that ca n't stand to be dropped from 2m high . 
  we 're in the top 5 ? 
  that 's ... surprising to say the least . 
  dear goodness ... 
  twice as likely than whom ? 
  i do n't know if all of the german countryside is good . 
  lived in berlin for a while , and going into brandenburg always felt like moving back a century . 
  unpaved roads , totally crumbling buildings , _ where are all the people ? _ , etc. 
  it ought to be . 
  absolutely crazy a building like this does n't have fire alarms . 
  this is not already mandatory ? 
  voted vvd , but would have loved to see a liberal-green coalition . 
  greens could have made a lot of gains on the environment front . 
  i do n't understand why they wo n't compromise on the entirely reasonable migration plan . 
   nobody 's talking about tolerating north korea having nukes , they 'll be taken out before they ever reach that stage . 
  they already have them . 
  whether they are truly usable , we do n't know , but at this stage removing nk by force will result in many , many casualties on south korean and possibly japanese side .
