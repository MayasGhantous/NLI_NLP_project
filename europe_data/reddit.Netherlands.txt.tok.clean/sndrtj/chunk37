  it 's not as easy as saying `` ah , brussels is their own gewest , to hell with it '' . 
  my condolences to the victims and their loved ones :-(, 
   you know that bunch of french-speaking peoples that live in what flemish nationalists claim is flanders well ... to be fair it _ used _ to be flemish , alright . 
  the language policies of the belgian state until the 1960s forced the native flemish population to frenchify . 
   belgium as you know it wo n't survive , luckily . 
  i hope you guys manage to find a way that does n't involve even _ more _ governments with equal power . 
  that said , i do have to agree the differences between flanders and wallonia are , at this point , quite huge . 
  you guys do n't communicate . 
  independence may be better for both of you . 
  the tourists leaving would be good for the city . 
  like so many european cities , barcelona is being destroyed by tourists . 
  that 's not his point . 
  any webdev will have to confront the reality that sooner or later , the chance of breach grows to 100 % . 
  well , you colonials can come back home if you want !, 
  if you finished in within a few minutes you did n't get point b. 
  you 're supposed to enjoy it , not chug it down like it 's water . 
  so take your time . 
  i live in the hague , which has similar issues . 
  some countries just abuse the diplomatic immunity . 
  having a beer ( or glass of wine ) after work is definitely common in the netherlands , but a ) it 'll be _ one _ glass b ) we drink mainly for [ gezelligheid ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/gezelligheid ) , not to get drunk c ) our standard glass size is tiny ( 25cl ) . 
  not trying to offend anyone , but this map is rubbish . 
  for example , nl only gets a score of 66 % because sexuality is not explicitly mentioned in anti-discrimination laws . 
  which is entirely unnecessary when the [ very first article of the dutch constitution ] ( https://www.government.nl/binaries/government/documents/regulations/2012/10/18/the-constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-the-netherlands-2008/the-constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-the-netherlands-2008.pdf ) bans discrimination of _ any _ sort . 
  how young are you ? 
  i remember the _ original _ german being a hit when i was in high school . 
   we just created a different burocratic process oh god ... 
  i do n't want to get into stereotypes , but that 's just too typical . 
  anyway , thanks for the translation !, 
  could you translate to english ? 
  kudos to italy for taking a strong stance against anti-vax paranoia !, 
  please see my comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bbhjj/dutch_coalition_formation_has_stalled/dhlfb7b/ ), 
  finding anything under 15 euros is rare here . 
  usually i end up paying 20-25 euros . 
  and that 's for men . 
  for women , prices a higher still . 
  it 's complicated . 
  while it 's legal in theory , in reality it 's not really . 
  actively looking for an egg donor is illegal . 
  meanwhile , actively looking for a sperm donor is all right . 
  this means that a lesbian couple can place an advertisement to find a father for their children , but a male gay couple has fewer options to legally find a mother for their children . 
  actively searching for , or advertising oneself as , a surrogate mother is banned outright . 
  this means that in websites likes [ these ] ( https://www.meerdangewenst.nl/ ) women have more opportunities than men to find a parent . 
  even if you _ do _ happen to find someone in your direct environment willing to be a surrogate mother , the rules are so strict it is [ not really possible ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzshi6eauly ) , which leads to people flying abroad to get it arranged . 
  then there are further complications which make parenthood difficult for gay couples . 
  [ a child can only have two parents ] ( http://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2146842-twee-moeders-twee-vaders-volgt-nu-ook-de-wet.html ) . 
  if a gay and lesbian couple have a child together , not all of the parents have legal custody , which has far-reaching consequences . 
  that 's a shame . 
  i do n't want a government with cu . 
  then we most likely wo n't be getting legal surrogacy and 4-parent families . 
  new elections . 
  we 're not used to minority governments . 
  that happened once in recent history , and it ended in a big massive disaster . 
  jesus that 's a cheap hairdresser . 
  becoming part of the eu means committing to the euro . 
  after tumultuous times , the ashikaga shogunate eventually prevailed , unifying japan under a single banner . 
  while the former daimyos of hosokawa still hold on to power around osaka , they too will soon be incorporated in japan proper . 
  the japanese economy is quickly recovering from all the bloodshed during the sengoku jidai , and soon the empire of japan will be feared and admired across the world . 
   the duke 's court you just literally said [ the hague ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hague ) . 
  modern airports have full-body scanners . 
  at amsterdam it 's mandatory , for instance . 
  i believe there once was a plan to open a spaceport in one of the islands . 
  and this , folks , is how the first financial bubble in history occurred . 
  this song was just too boring . 
  anything under 120bpm just does n't cut it for eurovision . 
  if only he were !, 
  the vast majority will be . 
  if you go to e.g. 
  ra'anana these days you 'll hear quite a lot of french . 
  i 'll raise my glass to that !, 
  vive la france !, 
  can we please _ not _ tell people _ what _ to vote ? 
   finmeccanica is n't that the parent company of ansaldobreda ? 
   german speaking countries are high on homeopathy ( hahnemann geh du voran ) , just shows that even reasonable mentalities can be quite nonsensical . 
  i think this may be related to the relative ease of getting homeopathic ` treatments ' . 
  it always struck me as odd that one can buy a whole range of homeopathic and ` herbal ' shenanigans at e.g. 
  rossman , but one needs to go to an actual pharamacy to get even plain old paracetamol . 
  that 's very different from nl , where you can basically get a pack of painkillers for free with you laundry detergent . 
  otc drugs are sold everywhere and are dirt cheap ( e.g. 
  50cts for a pack of painkiillers ) also , the proliferation of ` heilpraktiker ' in germany always worried me . 
  these people are essentially untrained charlatans masquerading as medical professionals . 
  le pen looks like one of those astrotv hostesses !, 
  israel is not going to intervene in anything if it is not itself threatened . 
  the former is impossible by the treaty . 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  not at all . 
  it 's a condom commercial . 
  you know , it 's _ supposed _ to be about sex . 
  japan entered the sengoku jidai with 4 human players . 
  war was of course entirely inevitable , with most of the archipelago in a constant state of war . 
  as shogun , the rebelling provinces are a concern . 
  unfortunately this meant a no-cb war against ouchi . 
  much of the ( very slow ) session was spent recovering from -5 stability . 
  however , by the end of the session , consolidation has taken place , with ashikaga now growing at a stable rate , and only two human players remaining . 
  meanwhile , northern honshu is dominated by the mega-daimyo of uesegi . 
  may the chrysanthemum throne thrive , by the grace of amaterasu 's lineage . 
  that did n't exactly work out , did it ? 
  yep . 
  it is a known fact eu is not a homogeneous block in this regard . 
  looking at my own country , we 'd stand to loose considerably from a ` hard brexit ' , since the uk is one of our main trading partners . 
  and even tho sentiment may be in favor of a hard brexit , ultimately it 's plain old money that decides .
