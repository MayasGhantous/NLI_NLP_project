  probably just what you 're used to . 
  for me , all those washing lines between buildings in southern europe look weird . 
  cute , but weird . 
  each to their own here . 
  around 0 . 
  yep . 
  it needs to be crystal clear skies . 
  roughly the same incomes here . 
  more tax though . 
  but honestly , how do you afford 3x $ 25k when you earn 50-100k a year ? 
  or do you take out a loan ? 
  if i 'd do that , i 'd completely screw my chances of ever getting a mortgage , so that 's not really an option here . 
  central europe is dry . 
  visit western europe once on those 5 days a year it 's 35 + degrees ; pressure cooker !, 
  in europe those `` window units '' are the * only * type of a/c available to most consumers . 
  offices have central a/c everywhere tho . 
  a/c is slowly getting more popular in houses here , but it 's nowhere near as ubiquitous as in the us . 
  like , my grandparents are the only ones in my family who have a/c , and that 's primarily because my grandmother ca n't handle anything above 25c . 
  i 've actually dried stuff outside in winter . 
  works just fine if it 's a sunny day . 
  bit slower perhaps , but not too much . 
  very . 
  i do n't have room for a dryer * and * washing machine . 
  so washing machine it is . 
  i do n't do anything else . 
  and i barely know anyone who uses a dryer on a regular basis . 
  just like in summer : on a rack inside - just with the windows closed rather than open . 
  actually , if it 's dry cold on a sunny day , air-drying outside actually also works , albeit a bit slower . 
  evaporation still happens , you know . 
  japan uses ridiculous amounts of a/c though , from my admittedly limited experience as a tourist . 
  i still do n't understand why you 'd set the a/c to 16-17c when it 's 35c outside ; 22c seems comfy enough to me . 
   have them to yourself and your friends for about 15 dollars a day . 
  oh man ... that 'd be classed as social housing here , for which you 'd be ineligible if you 'd earn anything more than minimum wage . 
  i want those prices !, 
  just how do you * pay * for all this ? 
  i 'm wondering if i 'll ever manage to buy a * single * car , and that 's with a pretty decent income , let alone * three * !, 
  that 's not true . 
  if you have trouble bending over , low entries can be quite difficult . 
  ask your grandparents . 
  i pay 19-21ct / kwh here , of which about [ 15ct is pure tax ] ( http://www.eon.nl/content/dam/eon_nl/products/tariefblad_regulier_flex_tarief_onb.pdf ) . 
  i 'm generally skeptical of eu expansion , but iceland is one of the few countries i 'd really welcome . 
  a rich , developed , modern country . 
  when 's the last time such a country joined the eu ? 
  any transcript of the video ? 
  i 'm on mobile here , do n't want to burn all my mbs . 
  then how come the high-income countries tend to have the lower unemployment rates ? 
  the decline of the worker class is the result of the * success * of social democrats in the preceding decades . 
  at least here in the netherlands there is almost nothing left to achieve for the social democrat traditionalist ; minimum wage , social security , education , pensions etc : they 're all there . 
  what 's left of the left is now a bunch of communists who want to change the system completely . 
  depends what city . 
  i live in a city with approx 30 % muslims . 
  immigration etc is a pretty large topic here . 
   meanwhile the eu can not do the deal without the imf because the german parliament wo n't allow it . 
  and this is the real problem . 
  the imf has a point when it says greece needs to default on ( part of ) its debt . 
  without debt relief , we will have this entire circus over and over , and no solution will present itself . 
  the germans need to come to terms with this . 
  investment by definition means taking risks , and yes , in this case that means that risk has to become reality . 
   it was right wing protesters ? 
  it was n't ; mostly . 
  seems google translate is fucking up here . 
  there * was * a right wing protest , yes . 
  and initially police had gathered for that purpose . 
  but it was the molenbeek youth who started rioting - they attempted to reach the place of right wing protest - and the vast majority of the 200-300 arrested were from molenbeek . 
  the article specifically mentions that it was the molenbook youth . 
  the police had indeed initially * gathered * for the right wing protest , but the 200-300 people arrested were mostly from molenbeek . 
  9 were those from the extreme right group . 
  perhaps google translate is failing you here . 
  any english-language source ? 
  the thing is history . 
  as margaret thatcher once said :  `` europe was created by history . 
  america was created by philosophy . '' essentially all of you are descendants of immigrants who knew they were immigrating . 
  old world conflicts are often about land and regions that have been debatable for hundreds , if not thousands of years , and neither party wishes to migrate . 
  i still do n't know what to vote . 
  i 'm rather torn . 
  my guts tells me ` no ' - i do n't want a ukraine in the eu , and even though i know that 's technically not what the treaty is about , it does leave a bit of sour aftertaste - but my brain is more ambiguous : a no-vote would be perfect to putin , so i 'm not sure that 's a good idea . 
  for any ukrainians in this thread : did your parliament codify protection of gays in the workplace in law , or did it not ? 
  a piece from foreign policy in november told me it did not , but dutch state broadcaster nos told me it did . 
  i 'm confused . 
  how a few kilometers can change entire political truths . 
  over here , the christian democrats are the ones with the existential and identity crisis . 
  the social democrats too , but the christians were the first to fall . 
  these are just aggregate crime numbers . 
  for some reason it wo n't actually give ethnicity for convicts ( just for suspects ) . 
  dutch [ crime suspects ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=81959ned&amp;d1=0,2&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=a&amp;d5=0&amp;d6=l&amp;vw=t ) - directly from the bureau of statistics . 
  about 50 % of them has an immigrant background ( = allochtoon ) , with the crime rate of non-western immigrants about 4 times higher than native dutch ( = autochtoon ) . 
  10s of millions of immigrants from at least semi-western societies , with largely the same religion . 
  having machine guns without a permit is illegal as it is . 
  no need for new laws . 
  even if they are not tried for terrorism , they can at least be tried for possession of illegal arms . 
  they can get up to 4 years for that fact alone . 
  as another note : the largest non-life punishment in the netherlands is 30 years . 
  the issue with the surveillance is simply manpower . 
  technology allows us to * record * vast amounts of data , but analyzing it is still finding a needle in a haystack . 
  technically nothing . 
  although , in practice it 's often a bowl of yoghurt or chips/nuts . 
  * personally * though , i rarely eat so early , since i go a bit later to work for travel purposes ( travelling after rush hour saves me a hell of a lot money ) . 
  i 'm rarely even home before 20:00 , so usually i eat at 20:30 or so . 
  the singularity is a joke . 
  never-ending exponential growth does n't exist in the real world .
