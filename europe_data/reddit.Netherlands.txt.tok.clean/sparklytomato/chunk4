  we went out in our regular attire - the guys in jeans and button-up shirts , the girls in casual dresses or just skinny jeans and a top - and we did n't realize our mistake until we got to the nightlife area of the city . 
  guys were dressed in three-piece suits ; girls in designer dresses and fur jackets . 
  we walked around for about two hours trying to get into clubs before heading over dejectedly to the mcdonald 's : the one place where our attire was apparently deemed acceptable . 
  stockholm is ridiculously trendy . 
  also , swedish people in general are very stylish and good-looking - same goes for copenhagen , although the discrepancy in fashion was a little less stark there than in stockholm . 
  it could have been nice if we had been better prepared but honestly i was kind of glad to get back to amsterdam where i did n't feel the need to keep up with the style rat-race . 
  not to say dutch people are n't stylish - well , some are , some are n't - but there 's definitely not the kind of fashion scene that there was in stockholm . 
  i 'd definitely like to go back there sometime and properly doll up , though . 
  i 've become too accustomed to having beer spilled over my nice dresses to ever really dress up for going out here in holland . 
  ah , see that sounds like how we drink our coffee . 
  tea is mostly for relaxation and for the taste , although i know quite a few people who drink their tea with milk and/or sugar ( both of which i find ruins the flavor ) . 
  coffee is more for `` survival '' purposes . 
  we dutch are pretty fond of our coffee but to be honest i never met true coffee fanatics until i spent some time in northern finland for an internship . 
  the amount of coffee consumed there is insane . 
  then again , it may be the key to surviving the long , dark winters . 
  that 's interesting about the difference between british and irish teas , though . 
  what are some irish tea brands that i could try ? 
  i like my tea nice and strong . 
  i really do n't remember off the top of my head which ones . 
  but basically whenever somebody 's hand moves towards the garbage disposal unit in the sink you * know * it 's going to get shredded . 
  i think there was a scene in the first season of american horror story where this happened . 
  either way , i 'm terrified of those things now . 
  fair enough ; i 'm a black coffee drinker myself but it 's pretty common around here to drink it with milk or cream . 
  i think a lot of people do n't necessarily drink coffee for the flavor , though - more for the boost of caffeine . 
  considering how big the english are on their tea , i always figured them to be connoisseurs of sorts , who would tend to be offended by the idea of diluting their tea . 
  oh god , i 've seen too many movie scenes where people 's hands get obliterated in those to ever even contemplate installing one . 
  i will never cease to be baffled at how the country that prides itself more than any other on their affinity for tea insists on polluting it with milk . 
  i thought my british friends were just the odd ones out , but as it turns out it 's actually common practice . 
  what 's the point in distinguishing between different types of tea if you 're just going to dilute them all with milk anyway ? 
  no , you 're right !, 
  the 90 's zorro was what i watched in the us , and i remember being throughly confused and disappointed when i came back to nl and they only had the 50 's zorro ( who , to my 8-year-old eyes , was much less attractive ) . 
  and yeah , i think it was on one of the belgian channels . 
  that one was pretty awesome too , though . 
  but the 90 's zorro is the staple of my childhood . 
  i still remember the [ theme song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgagjln2tbs ) by heart . 
  i spent 3 years of my childhood in the us and the rest in the netherlands , so my memories are a mix of american and dutch stuff .

  a display like the one in the pic was basically my personal idea of heaven . 
  omg that game !, 
  that was my favorite game too , except it was called ` spookslot ' in dutch . 
  we played it until the cardboard kids were all bent and worn down . 
  i disagree completely , although i have to say this debate has worn me down and exhausted me and made me incredibly sad . 
  i do n't have the energy to continue so i wo n't do it anymore . 
  feel free to see that as a victory if you want to . 
  this article puts everything i want to say much more eloquently , so i will refer you to it in the hope that you will read it and maybe develop a better understanding of what it is exactly that the other side is trying to achieve . 
  http://socialisme.nu/blog/nieuws/32040/alledaags-racisme-in-nederland/ that 's it . 
  i 'm out . 
  i do n't know , i know a lot of people who make the argument that `` slavery is a long time ago , black people should get over it , the netherlands is the least racist country in the world . '', 
  that kind of thinking is delusional . 
  you make a good point , but i think discussion should always be possible . 
  as much as the racism is exposed , so is awareness . 
  the group of people who support changing piet 's looks is growing every day . 
  i fully recognize that racism is contagious , but i do n't think burying the issues is the way to counter that . 
  it 's painful but it 's not a meaningless debate . 
  i think a lot of people are becoming more aware of the racism around them as a result , and i think that 's a good thing . 
  it 's true that there 's nothing strange about wearing your hair straight , and i 'm not saying that everybody who does it secretly wants to be white . 
  but it 's one of the things that white people use to discriminate against black people , and for that reason alone , i think it should n't be acceptable for a white person to use that `` for fun '' . 
  same goes for the big lips , by the way . 
  i would personally be a proponent of making zwarte piet black as a result of the soot ( not just pretend anymore ) , and leave away the lips , the afro and the earrings . 
  i think there are so many ways we could present the image of piet that do n't involve a hurtful stereotype . 
  to me , the vitriolic reaction against anybody who opposes the current image also shows a regrettable lack of creativity , because i feel like the character of zwarte piet offers so much potential for change . 
  as ugly as it is , i think it 's a very good thing that racists are being exposed as such as a result of this discussion . 
  the danger that you mention , that it becomes acceptable , is worrying of course . 
  but the underlying racism would never have come out without a discussion like this , and i feel like we should at least be aware of the fact that we do n't live in a `` color-blind society '' , like so many dutch people like to pretend . 
  it sounds racist because it is racist . 
  the image that the media present to black women is that their natural looks are not good enough ; that a skinny white , straight-haired girl is the image that should be strived for . 
  that whole idea is racist in itself . 
  the fact is that black women are often discriminated against because of their hair . 
  `` good hair '' is straight hair , and is the general standard that is acceptable in a professional environment or in the media ( which is ridiculous of course ! ) . 
  i have read countless stories of black women whose employer scolded them for wearing a natural afro , because it was n't `` professional '' . 
  the desire among black women to obtain `` good hair '' has resulted in a billion-dollar industry that provides hair relaxers , weaves , etc. 
  it 's not surprising when you consider the image that the media present as desirable : even very few black women on tv wear their hair naturally . 
  chris rock made a documentary about this : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213585/ and yes , white people painting their face black - particularly when it is paired with the red lips and the afro - is always considered blackface . 
  whether or not you agree with that definition is another matter . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  everybody thinks `` blackface '' is an american thing , but the reason that blackface is offensive is not so much the history that it has from minstrel shows , etc. 
  it is that white people , people who society caters for , dress up `` for fun '' as black people , people who still experience racism every day , subtle and otherwise . 
  imagine , for example , the struggle that many black women have with their hair . 
  and then imagine how they must feel when they see a bunch of white people dressing up as them for a day - ha ha , so funny , this curly wig , these big lips - and then see them be able to take off that wig and wipe off that paint at the end of the day and get back to being white . 
  they ca n't take off their hair like a wig ; for them it 's part of their identity and part of the reason they still experience racism at the hands of those very same white people every day ( yes , even in the netherlands ) . 
  in my opinion it 's not so much the historical context as much as it is the every-day implications now . 
  but i 'll stop there , because i 'm not black , and i feel uncomfortable discussing why black people may or may not be offended by blackface . 
  i 'm sure there are others around the web who can put this more eloquently . 
  i do n't fully agree . 
  in this specific example , people support zwarte piet because they have never been taught anything else . 
  they grew up with him , they never thought of him in a negative way . 
  he is a hero of everybody 's childhood . 
  therefore it is extremely difficult to extricate themselves from their own understanding of zwarte piet and view him in an objective manner . 
  imo , that does not make them racists . 
  it just makes them ignorant . 
  not even willfully - you have to understand that education about racism is woefully lacking here in the netherlands , which is another problem altogether . 
  however , i * do * think that the image of zwarte piet itself is indubitably racist , and ought to be changed . 
  i am also fully convinced that once people become truly aware of the racist implications of zp , they will come around , like many people already have . 
  that said , many of the comments defending zwarte piet here and elsewhere are incredibly racist and embarrassing , and i have no qualms labeling anybody like that a racist . 
  not to mention there is no way anybody could stop the dutch from celebrating sinterklaas . 
  let alone mark rutte , lol . 
  i am really enjoying watching everybody get their panties in a bunch over this . 
  but most of all i think it 's really great that all of this has finally opened the doors to a discussion that we should have had a long time ago . 
  same goes for the reverse : just because the intent is n't racist , does n't mean it 's not racist .
