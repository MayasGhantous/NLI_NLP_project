  then every year they could vote for raising the retirement one year until we 're left with one small group of old dictators . 
  i do n't feel really strong about the subject either way . 
  should pass a referendum to ban voting over retirement age . 
  they no longer participate , they can only watch . 
  different countries have different proofing techniques : 1 . http://i.imgur.com/ycrttfp.png 2 . http://i.imgur.com/wbyvfyp.png [ 1 source ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/36beqv/proofing_techniques_with_usa/ ) [ 2 source ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/36ar18/proofing_techniques_with_rosja/ ), 
  well you know , google is just one of many methods to figure things out . 
  its great for literature research but not really so good for discovering things that are not digitized . 
  i think most people become a lot more stupid if they get a camera pointed in their face and have to answer on the spot without getting time to think about it . 
  this is more a test of keeping your cool than of being smart . 
  since you can google it quite easily , why remember such stuff . 
  they should 've thought us instead how to figure it out for yourself . 
  if you move to asia for example the capital city names of europe are useless , but knowing different methods of finding out these names is not . 
  research methods are universal , research data is not . 
  you 're doing it wrong : 1 . 
  the netherlands 2 . 
  germany 3 . 
  norway 4 . 
  france 6 . 
  switzerland 9 . 
  sweden 10 . 
  time spending on the job ! = working . 
  we did some pretty horrific things to indonesia . 
  the most insane one being declaring war on them just after world war 2 . 
  they would probably get invaded by china and or us/japan, 
  it does n't account for cost of living i believe . 
  wait , why are all the names different of political parties . 
  why ca n't i see the dutch names ( even the abbreviations are different ) . 
  i do n't know any of these parties . 
  last european union elections i voted for the pirate party , but they are not there . 
  so basically my mep ( < -- what ever the hell that means ) is not available ? 
  thanks . 
  european colonialism in europe ? 
  you guys really took it to the next level . 
  voted for the gays against the motion . 
  well you hardly can call it a colony , it was under british occupation . 
  was n't all of scandinavia ruled at one point by denmark ? 
  except in this case the authors * and * the readers want it both to be for free . 
   who did n't vote were in favor i just did n't care , i do n't understand why we vote for something which should obviously be decided by parliament . 
  i was reading the ballot and thought , no i do n't care about this . 
  its because of the conversion to the metric system . 
  although there are a lot they 're usually stored pretty organized . 
  there are just a bunch of rows and each rows has an x number of spots in which fits exactly one bike . 
  you can usually jam it in there and if you put it somewhere you just remember how far you walked approximately and at which row number you parked it ( approximately , nobody counts ) , take a quick glance at it while you walk away and finding it should take about a minute , worst thing that can happen is that you walk into the wrong row , but if that happens you usually spot your bike at the other side . 
  yes cause i thought you missed the point . 
  maybe if i reworded it becomes more clear . 
  i think we agree though . 
  i just try to use the fact that there are car accidents to reduce the consequences . 
  i do n't want to lose freedoms in favour of `` security '' . 
  people worry about cars and they 're still more likely to get killed by a car then a terrorist . 
  so instead of worrying about the terrorist they should worry * more * about cars . 
  and yes we also should all be homeless . 
  i imagine we could invade russia in winter if we were all homeless . 
  thank you, 
  that 's why i lay the comparison , because its stupid to worry about . 
  the car will get you 200 000 more often than some terrorist , so you should worry about the car . 
  does n't need to , its a huge difference to overcome . 
  no that 's natural selection . 
  idiots like this will have us live in a police state . 
  [ you 're 200 000 times more likely to get hit by a car then be killed by a terrorist ] ( http://lamoscagames.com/neverbored/you-think-youre-gonna-be-killed-in-a-terrorist-attack-think-again/ ) . 
  best thing to do is ignore terrorism , watch out for cars instead . 
  yes, 
  [ time to overthrow the bourgeoisie !, 
  thanks for your service . 
  they 're proud enough of their heritage to keep it going , but not disturbing enough to be prosecuted . 
   not even religion hey , we have islam and its gaining popularity !, 
  you can btw solve the , `` there is no time before the big bang problem '' with the [ inflation theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inflation_%28cosmology%29 ) . 
  saying that all that energy before gravity was established was god , fits quite good . 
  i do n't believe it myself , but i could see it work . 
  i like designing religion in my free time . 
  right ? 
  imagine what they could do with bones !, 
  yes , but its just your culture , what are you gon na do about it ? 
  dogs walk naked outside all the time and even if they want be artists nobody gives a shit . 
  yes , but these stances are not mutually exclusive . 
   they 've been doing it for centuries . 
  it 's a tradition . 
  [ thats not even an argument . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appeal_to_tradition ), 
  did you just say the w word ? 
  its because the greeks used the ancient phalanx formation . 
  the belgian king tried to break it with a horse charge but was killed in combat . 
  so now its a greek colony . 
  yes as everyone knows the netherlands have a history of poverty and corruption . 
  why does n't the uk devaluate ? 
  i feel my safe space is being violated right now . 
  the biggest issue is that they * have * to assign a grade , so the lazy teacher will just ask everybody to make the same thing so it 'll be easy to compare . 
  i was always disgusted by the mentality around grading . 
  its something inherently unjust , for art classes it heavily depended on the opinion of the teacher , and for maths , well you just had to get lucky to have studied that particular answer . 
  big chance you would 've forgotten it a week later . 
  the other major issue is that classmates are going to compare . 
  you 'll get statements like `` that guy is stupid because he gets bad grades '' . 
  kids are relentless about this kind off stuff ( boys * and * girls alike , but boys may be more inclined to shout it ) . 
  i 'm still disgusted by grades , but i also do n't have a scalable alternative . 
  i 've given this way more thought than i should . 
  considering i 'm doing a masters degree right now ... 
  if you take into account what projection was used , its not right ever . 
  the pen is mightier than the sword !, 
  do n't you see ? 
  reading it is the kampf !, 
  is n't he comparing back to rome ?
