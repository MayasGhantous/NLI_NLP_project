davutoglu 's face allways reminds me of the kind uncle at your birthday . 
  you mean to say that mel gibson does not shoot lightning out of is eyes and fire out of his arse ? 
  it 's still weird to me every time that i read that not everyone that lives in scotland is a broad-chested , kilt wearing ethnic scot , simillar to the braveheart film . 
  is this youtube on the drug called 4chan ? 
  i think i saw a video like this about the european parliament , good stuff . 
  you have a raging boner for him ? 
  because the data sometimes tells you different things than what you would expect . 
  that 's why you should n't guess , 
  with ? 
  i imagine a russian pilote trying to make friends with the americans by goofing around and showing a cool trick . 
  [ only to be critized by later . 
  :p ] ( http://www.karmenmcnamara.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gallbladderposter1_1024x10241.png ), 
  i see what you did there . 
  please call me tovarisch . 
  ah haha well my argument for that was that the northern part of romania was called dacia libera when the south was under roman control . 
  [ it seems you 're right ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/harta_etnica_2011_jud.png ) i guess you 're from that area judging by your nick . 
  do you know why there are so many there ? 
  low profile is best profile if you are involved in shady deals  . 
  still her name must get her some votes from basescus fanbase . 
  what did basescu not say ? 
  ah interresting i did not know that . 
  pretty weird way to put it though , we do n't call romanian germans daco-germans right ? 
  it does not really do justice to the origin of the people you are referring to . 
  are n't most gypsies living in oltenia ? 
  that makes sense yeah . 
  [ this would be way too silly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lusitania ), 
  a bit of a related question , i was scrolling through the list of european parliament members and i saw that his daughter had a chair . 
  what kind of a politician is she ? 
  is she popular with the people ? 
  nice , you 're fast . 
  what is a luso-moldovan ? 
  regardless of the fact if basescu is popular in romania , his agenda seems pretty clear . 
  he would have to interact with johannis and if moldova opens more up to romania than johannis would have to return the positive vibes . 
  only if they have a treaty right ? 
  it would also help moldova get closer to romania i imagine, 
  and [ plans for a new fence on their border ofcourse ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cllnhr0.png ), 
  did n't he apply for moldovan citizenship last month ? 
  he was going to run for president there people said . 
  the next cuza they said . 
  next up : `` pope arrested for people smuggling . '', 
  ^ i ^ know ^ paperwork ^ was ^ done ^ beforehand, 
  deal !, 
  every year at easter . 
  allright maybe not every other day , but it [ definitely ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-jet-flies-close-to-nato-ships-in-the-baltic-sea-in-a-show-of-military-force-10319227.html ) is n't the first time, 
  it 's genius . 
   at present , only new recruits joining sensitive areas of the military are required to undergo background checks . 
  why not everyone ? 
  if your training someone to kill you better know where his loyalty lies right ? 
  does n't this happen like every other day in the baltics ? 
  everyone knows about it here in the netherlands . 
  we 're all laughing in our fist because you are so blind !, 
  every dutch person has secretly bought a share in your precious harbor . 
  after nine years of secrecy we will finally put all the shares together in order to create a majority share . 
  no one will ridicule us after we have the whole of europe by the balls !, 
  you better pay us 5 % `` protection money '' so nothing will happen to it . 
  i guess only the internal borders will change . 
  the external will still be maintained like they are now . 
  this, 
  so you 're saying the yugoslav state wanted a macedonia without any ties to bulgaria and therefore invented their new identity ? 
  the last part of your comment is not very clear to me . 
  do you mean that bulgarians linguists made up a new language for the macedonians ? 
  [ inainteee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgvh4n6046u ) in the voice of amza pellea, 
  my bad , [ updated version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5fx2fuf.png ) , 
  lol , watch out before we buy all of the constanta harbor . . 
  top banter, 
  i knew about all the fences we have with turkey . 
  but that the bulgarians were contemplating building another along the greek border i did not . 
  thanks . 
  [ ciolos discussed it with dutch pm mark rutte ] ( https://youtu.be/ugzz7bjv3ua?t=5m3s ) last month he was here . 
  purely an anecdote : a macedonian friend of mine told me this also happened with the croatian language . 
  after the split of yugoslavia he said that the croatians introduced different words to claim a different language from the serbs . 
  i do n't know if it 's true but this seems to happen a lot in ( south - ) eastern europe . 
  reminds me of [ the boston marathon bombings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ldisfmq.png ), 
  does bulgaria have a border fence covering the entire length of it ? 
  hahahaha i read a joke somewhere that the newly planned fence would be something like this : [ new border fence ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vcb4exb.jpg ), 
  hahaha yeah that 's true though i read some time ago that there were some people trying to get in through the coast area . 
  if romania joins schengen , will that mean that there will be a new potential route for migrants . 
  an eastern route ? 
  germans : love : drinking , way of amusement : drinking , find death : drinking ( wine ), 
  are n't you seen as the same people ? 
  that 's awesome . 
  i have been reading a lot about european history . 
  however , i have not dug into the celtic world for now . 
  as i have about \u00b1 10 % czech heritage can i claim celtic glory as well ? 
  is there any particular reason for that ? 
  and north-cyprus ? 
  haha do you really need a statistic to know the outcome to that . 
  it 's not that bad though . 
  more than half of the people respond positive . 
  everyone knows australia is basically in europe . 
  holland and the provinces is better imho, 
  that 's harsh, 
  yeah you 're right . 
  nothing beats peeing if you 've been holding it up for that long . 
  bunch of savages , 
  is there any info as to why ? 
  perfect for hollywood , the americans do n't have their own middle ages so they would n't now . 
  just a joke inb4 . 
  i really want to go there but i have heard that the number of tourists is stupendous . 
  that looks so crazy close to the eifel tower,
