  i see you 've never talked to a frisian , 
  dutch is my native language . 
  and i also speak english fluently and can hold conversations in german and a little bit in french . 
  unfortunately , i can also understand frisian . 
  in what country ? 
  i have never seen someone under employ of the npo call the pvv or lpf nazis here in the netherlands . 
  only the nvu are called nazis and wel ... they do seem like nazis . 
  you 're really trying to be victims here , but you 're not being oppressed more then i am . 
  it is quite telling , that after reaching a score of 10 , my post suddenly got hit by a wave pf downvotes . 
  talk about censoring dissenting opinions ... 
   issues that are typical for them although i admit there are problems , they are not  getting worse and worse on the contrary , i see more and more well integrated muslims around me . 
  i live near several and i work and study with them . 
  not once have i experienced anything bad with muslims that i have n't experienced with local people . 
  it 's more an issue of integration , than it is a cultural one . 
  and it is simply not true that you ca n't critisize muslims or islam . 
  in many countries , the anti-islam parties are doing very well , so you really ca n't make yourself a victim here . 
   the muslims we have to live/study/work with every single day in our own countries oh wow , what a chore must that be . 
  you really make it sound like as if every muslim you meet will ruin your day . 
  but several bishops have , and i believe even a cardinal . 
   it is only forbidden to have gay sex and you agree with that ? 
  this is an utterly despicable rule . 
  you ca n't say that you have nothing against homosexuals if you agree with this . 
   you should be grateful to the church , thanks to the church the legacy of the greeks and romans was preserved as someone studying history , you should know we owe that mostly to the muslims , who , at the time , did not burn any books that disagreed with them . 
  like the catholic church was doing at the same time . 
  ( and for centuries after ) you talk like as if the catholics did nothing wrong , even though they oppressed and murdered countless people . 
  or do you agree that homosexuals are lesser people that do n't deserve equal rights ? 
  if the church does n't hate homosexuals , then they should n't proclaim that they deserve to die . 
  but yet , the catholic church does exactly that , in africa, 
  * catholic christian ofcourse, 
  [ this poll ] ( http://expresso.sapo.pt/politica/portugueses-querem-referendo-sobre-coadocao=f855888 ) disagrees with you . 
  edit : also , the portuguese government was democratically elected . 
  and noone is being forced anything , some people just get equal rights . 
   christianity brought us the true meaning of marriage that 's just , your opinion , man  that does n't mean you can change whatever you please yes it does , if that 's what most people agree on , almost anything can be done . 
  just that you do n't agree with gay people marrying , does n't mean that i do n't deserve the same rights as anyone . 
  no , because keeping something that has been changing for millenia the same as it was at an arbitrary point in time , simply because you agree with the viewpoints people had at said time , is ignorant . 
  now that 's just ignorant . 
  and now , it is changing again . 
  to be fair , marriage did n't start as a religious thing , the church just took it as a responsibility after the roman empire collapsed . 
  yeah , but then they 're still a quarter million short ... 
  they probably also used the potential children the people that have left would have had in the calculation . 
  well the belgians are dutch anyway / s but philips is a dutch company , so it would be a dutch-japanese invention as far as i 'm concerned . 
  well it 's obviously not like a modern submarine , but it could definitely travel under water so calling it a diving machine is a little bit of an understatement . 
  but whatever floats your boat i guess . 
  the submarine was a dutch invention , and i believe also the cd . 
  edit : case in point, 
  never did anyone say anything about dumb an poor people , you just made that up . 
  the fact that you think that lower educated people are '' dumb and poor '' is simply insulting . 
  what if i were lower educated ? 
  would i be dumb and poor too ? 
  besides , / u/gooserampage was talking about racism , not immigration or dis-homogeneity , you just made that up as well . 
  do you so desperatly want to be a victim that you just change everything in someones comment , just so that he seems like a bad guy ? 
  even more importantly , he posted 2 studies to back up his claim , or are those two well respected institutions spreading propaganda too ? 
  i find it curious that this comes from an account with only three comments , but nearly 900 comment karma , do you have something to hide ? 
  yeah but at least that 's not as bad as this ... 
  so you 're saying that it 's propaganda to say that lower education levels are linked to racism ? 
   you also have to keep in mind that these regulations were made when hiv especially under gay men was significantly more spread than it is today actually the regulations were loosened less then a week ago . 
  before that it was simply impossible for homosexual men to donate blood . 
  i know that these rules are there for a reason , but i still do think that men who have been in a relationship for a long time should be able to donate . 
  yeah , i believe that about 2 thirds of hiv patients are gay , so it 's understandable . 
  even women who have had sex with a man , who has had sex with another man , ca n't donate . 
  they ask if you have had sex with a man within the last year , so they do n't specifically ask whether you 're gay . 
  yup , although i could donate ... if i refrain from having sex with a man for a year . 
  it used to be worse , in that it was impossible to donate at all if you were gay . 
  i understand why they decided this , because hiv tests are not very reliable , but it 's still silly since many gay men have steady relationships and their blood is obviously perfectly safe . 
  unfortunately , the situation is not going to change anytime soon . 
  yeah , i ca n't donate either , but that 's because i 'm gay . 
  ehm , you are aware someone else posted that comment ? 
  not / u/myschlongsprettylong, 
  that is probably also why the netherlands is so low ; our housing bubble burst a couple of years ago . 
  i think you underestimate how many wars christianity went through and how many people died in them . 
  do you have a lot of banana stands in your street ? 
  ** greek fire ca n't melt theodosian walls ** ** 1453 was an inside job **, 
  they will lay it as a doormat at the border . 
  yeah , he seems to be either dutch ( or european ) or mixed with antillian . 
  the latter is more likely since antillians often have american names . 
  though it 's not as bad , we have something similar going on . 
  it mostly happens in greenhouses in the south of the country . 
  many eastern europeans are forced to work for very low wages and are housed in compounds and have to work so many hours that they barely have time to go out and do something for themselves . 
  it 's a terrible situation for these people and it 's a disgrace that it 's happening . 
  yeah , it 's a northern/eastern thing . 
  it 's mildly popular in the south , where they do n't celebrate st. martin 's . 
  which is on november 11th . 
  then it should also include germany and spain . 
  even mexico could join . 
  he should be the pm . 
  he was not the chief editor of the telegraaf at the time . 
  i think he meant relatively ... 
  source on that ? 
  ca n't find it anywhere . 
  except that in this specific case , there was only one side spouting lies . 
  my point was that such a treaty has nothing to do with integrating in the eu . 
  in fact , when the eu previously made such deals with other european countries , the treaty mentioned that both parties should work towards european integration . 
  this part was specifically left out when the treaty with ukraine was made . 
  we already have it and it 's called the telegraaf . 
  i never said anything about xenophobia or right wingers . 
  all the opponents of the treaty are populists however and lied to the public . 
  thing is , most opponents kept quiet about the war and mh17 unless confronted about it . 
  the right wing opponents then blamed the eu for the war and some said that ukraine shot the plane down . 
  that was only one group and they blamed ukraine for the crash . 
  yeah , the opponents mostly kept quiet about that .
