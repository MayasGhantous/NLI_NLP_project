http://newsroom.iza.org/de/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/welfare-magnet-hypothesis-and-welfare-take-up.pdf this says exactly the opposite of what you are saying . 
  it is based on oecd data . 
   contrary to the welfare magnet hypothesis , empirical evidence suggests that immigration decisions are not made on the basis of the relative generosity of the receiving nation 's social benefits . 
  even when immigrants are found to use welfare more intensively than natives , the gap is mostly attributable to differences in social and demographic characteristics between immigrants and non-immigrants rather than to immigration status per se . 
  moreover , evidence in some countries suggests that immigrants exhibit less welfare dependency than natives , despite facing a higher risk of poverty . 
  even if it were , it still has a lower gdp . 
  $ 16.773 trillion vs $ 14.623 trillion . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_nations, 
  the quality of that sub is surprisingly good by the way . 
  that 's a bold statement . 
  are you talking about a civil war ? 
  why would it matter that their native population would be a minority ? 
  also , do you have a source for this ? 
  to be fair , it 's not actually hard to deal with ebola in a first world country . 
  preventing ebola from spreading would n't be a problem here . 
  well , there is this : [ the european union 's civil protection mechanism ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-14-503_en.htm ), 
  i did n't know this , do you happen to know the official name of this scheme ? 
  he is great with languages . 
  check out this youtube video , english is n't the only language he is good at . 
  it was just their website though . 
  personal info from 20k people was stolen . 
  while that is n't good , it 's not like a critical system was in danger . 
  they say it will create 250.000 jobs . 
  which i think really is a lot for 5 billion euros, 
  why not ? 
  they have below average vat . 
  their tax as % gdp is below average as well . 
  38.8 % in eu27 and 36.1 % in the uk . 
  [ table ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ye1xh ) sources : [ eurostat ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/2-29042013-cp/en/2-29042013-cp-en.pd ) , [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_value_added_tax#vat_rates ), 
  20 % is n't high , it 's below average actually . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_value_added_tax#vat_rates cyprus ( 19 % ) , germany ( 19 % ) , luxembourg ( 15 % ) , malta ( 18 % ) are the only ones with lower standard vat rates . 
  what tools do you use to make these maps ? 
  does anyone know whether that is a real train ? 
  would love to ride a train like that some day, 
  you 're right about them not being crowned , however there is a [ crown ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_of_the_netherlands ) . 
  is it really that hard to not make something about refugees ? 
  yeah , just a passport wo n't grant you asylum . 
  i think a lot of people miss that . 
  you do n't get asylum that easily . 
  i do n't understand why many people complain that only 1/5 is syrian . 
  that just means that less asylum seekers get to stay . 
  are you claiming there are n't any syrians coming to europe ? 
  or just sharing an anecdote ? 
  you mean asylum seekers . 
  in what country ? 
  you do n't have a flair ( yet ? ), 
  do you have any specifics on what kind of weapons ? 
  i do n't think the rebels really use any armor or vehicles besides capture ones and modified civilian vehicles and as far as i 've seen in videos there were n't really any western weapons used at all . 
  right , that is what i was trying to say . 
  it is considered an issue . 
   2 ) the corporate owned mass media and the political left have all enabled fgm by calling anyone addressing the issue crack pots and racists . 
  it still works . 
  what ? 
  i do n't know where you live but i do n't think anyone here does n't consider this an issue . 
  especially not because someone is afraid to be called a racist . 
  i do n't think you can just send people on a plane to syria . 
  first of all because there are n't any commercial planes flying there and secondly because it is a war zone . 
  so where do we send them ? 
  no country in the world would accept them . 
  yes , those 260 kosovans , 240 albanians and 55 serbians will surely destroy europe . 
  i do n't know about finland , but in the netherlands the poor municipalities have three times as many refugees . 
  not necessarily . 
  poor dutch municipalities are much more likely to take in refugees than richer ones . 
  this is because their local politicians are more likely to vote in favour of a new asylum centre . 
  that will never happen . 
  do you seriously believe europe will become islamic with a couple of million refugees ? 
  they do n't have the right to free healthcare . 
  they have to pay for healthcare but if they are n't able to , 80 % will be paid by the government . 
  this is only the case for everything covered in the minimum insurance . 
  ( * basispakket * ) non-necessary procedures will not be covered . 
  when i was in syria / qatar / brunei , where mosques are very abundant , i never heard anyone complain about it and never had any problems with them either . 
  true . 
  but fortunately it is n't . 
  as someone who has , it really is not a big deal at all . 
  you normally do n't hear them indoors . 
  especially at night . 
  you ca n't build up a life in a refugee camp in turkey . 
  the syrian civil war is n't going away either , so what should they do ? 
  live in camps for x years ? 
  who are those people ? 
  so you vote for wilders ? 
  of all parties the pvv is the worst in solving any problem . 
  they do n't even have any capable politicians and never propose realistic solutions . 
  but on the other hand , you guys barely have any refugees . 
  no , let 's stop pretending that it 's a simple problem and you have the answer and all other people are too afraid to admit you are right . 
  or whatever other reason you think other people do n't want to admit that you are right . 
  those people disagree with you for good reasons . 
  my point was more that it is n't just that nobody wants to admit it . 
  i actually think that is an arrogant thing to say , a lot of people disagree on this matter . 
  people that actually have studied economics and are experts in their fields . 
  glad to see we have an economic expert in our mids that is smarter than all the others . 
  / s if it really were that easy grexit would have happened a long time ago . 
  nobody wants a euro crisis . 
  wilders has been saying this for years . 
  although he usually talks about a jewish-christian tradition he wants to preserve . 
  no , he misread it . 
  it is 3,477.15 mil , or 3 billion euros . 
  it 's actually 3 billion . 
  what i found :  with ttip the commission intends to follow the practice it adopted with the recently agreed trade agreement between the eu and canada ( ceta ) . 
  the commission published the text of the agreement before eu and canadian government lawyers had checked it and before it had been translated into all 24 official eu languages .
