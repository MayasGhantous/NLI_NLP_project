    once the lawyers have checked the published text , the commission will send it to the council and the european parliament for ratification . 
  the general public can already see exactly what has been negotiated . 
  source : http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/about-ttip/questions-and-answers/index_en.htm, 
  do you have a reputable source for that ? 
  it sounds just too ridiculous to be true , especially if this happens in a significant number of cases . 
  why ? 
  it should n't be that hard to determine if someone is a child or not . 
  it should be noted that those countries also get money from another fund . 
   the internal security fund ( isf ) was set up for the period 2014-20 , with a total of eur 3.8 billion for the seven years . 
  [ table ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0pakole.png ) [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/financing/fundings/security-and-safeguarding-liberties/internal-security-fund-borders/index_en.htm ) note that countries that are n't in shengen do n't get any money . 
  whereas countries that are in shengen but not in the eu like norway do get money . 
  greece gets 166 mln , italy 156 mln , spain 195 mln . 
  it 's not just 20 million euros . 
  it comes from the asylum , migration and integration fund . 
  they 'll get 266 million euros between 2014-2020 . 
  italy gets more money from the same fund . 
  this money comes from the * asylum , migration and integration fund * and italy will recieve 310 million euros from it , whereas france will get 266 million . 
  the uk will get the most money , 370 million . 
  the reason this is news is just because france just got its first tranche of money .

  it 's also a lot easier to say when it is all hypothetical . 
  my parents have lived as expats in brunei , syria , qatar and malaysia and there really is no mixing with the locals at all . 
  i guess this has a lot to do with cultural differences as well . 
  it 's weird how only the shitty / tabloid media seem to report on this ,, 
  all two of them, 
  how would they gain so significantly from ttip ? 
  this is n't specific to the uk though, 
  so ... enlighten us, 
  well we did n't know they actually signed a treaty . 
  the problem was that greece could not pay its debts . 
  so what is the problem with money going to lenders and banks ? 
  that 's the whole point and it 's in the interest of the people that this happened as well . 
  stop blaming everything on the big scary banks . 
  also the language being english really helps . 
  most undergrad courses are in the native language , at least in my country . 
  why would anyone do that ? 
  i honestly can not believe this is more than just an urban legend , let a lone a * huge * problem . 
  if you do n't know the language you can not even get a degree . 
  eu pays as much as british citizens actually . 
  source : wanted to study in the uk as well . 
  i this context obviously yes . 
  wow , the uk took in almost 200.000 foreign students last year . 
  that 's crazy . 
  pretty sure the first set of numbers should be multiplied by a thousand, 
  that 's just cynical speculation, 
  i totally agree . 
  the commission , although undemocratic , does deliver some impressive work . 
  there is n't a single comment about assad is the good guy here . 
  just because people agree with this statement does n't justify his deeds . 
  can you imagine ? 
  someone with a different opinion than you . 
  they must be brainwashed . 
  i meant specifically with regard to espionage . 
  could you expand on its relation with ttip ? 
  which is not surprising considering he , at leasts claims to , have written a masters thesis on the subject . 
  well yes it probably is at the expense of someone else . 
  there is a lot more competition . 
  but that is hardly a bad thing . 
  could you emphasize on your main point ? 
  why would n't strong businesses create more jobs ? 
  if they have more trade , they would have to hire more people to keep up production . 
  it might not have a direct benefit to my existing employees . 
  but since i can hire more people it is directly beneficial to the community . 
  of course , it would n't make me a philanthropist . 
  i would hire more people so i could make more money . 
  so by that logic it would ` trickle down ' . 
  why would n't it ? 
  with ttip i could export to the us much more easily as an entrepreneur . 
  if it really were this clear , france , spain and italy would never agree with it . 
  did you read the article ? 
  you may not agree with it , but 119 billion a year is a good reason . 
  it also discusses isds . 
  altough they are n't formally a member yet , eso lists them as one and everyone considers them a member . 
  they are expected to formally become a member this year . 
  even if you do n't consider them a member , they will pay a accession fee of 130 million euros over 10 years . 
  that 's almost 10 % of the current budget . 
  kind of . 
  brazil is actually a member of eso as well , just as switzerland . 
  eso , like esa , is not an eu institution . 
  do you have a source for this ? 
  yeah . 
  a lot of airliners already do this , especially in the us . 
  do you have a source ? 
  i ca n't find anything about the code being used . 
  although you 'd expect it to be known because an alarm should sound once the code is entered . 
  well , apparently this happened before on a a320 due to a software error in the automatic pilot . 
  however , this has been fixed two years ago . 
  i ca n't imagine they did n't update their software . 
  according to dutch press , the pilot has a code to open the door in case the co-pilot is unconscious . 
  now the co-pilot can still deny access in case eg a hijacker knows the code . 
  so in that case the co-pilot deliberately stopped the pilot from accessing the cockpit , which is very suspicious . 
  [ video about this system ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixehv7c3vxs ), 
  same here , even though i have lived in a neighborhood with a lot of immigrants and a mosque on my way to school for about 4 years . 
  you 're right . 
  it 's the only g20 flag that matches https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g-20_major_economies#list_of_members, 
  right . 
  because there is no problem with islamic terrorism in europe . 
  source ? 
  is that really what he wants though ? 
  he also said that he did n't want this in the constitution .
