  yes . 
  that 's obvious . 
  they probably would n't even need a refugee crisis for it in the first place . 
  surely it has happened . 
  all i am saying is that you should n't believe that because isis said so . 
  well a terror organisation is n't exactly a reputable source when they make claims which spread terror . 
  you shoulnd ' t blindly listen to them . 
   included in their estimate is not jihadists coming into europe with the current mass stream of migrants . 
  they claim this is not systematically happening . 
  what they base this claim on , i have no idea , since they literally have no way of checking for it . 
  oh right , because you do n't understand , it must be false . 
  glad to have a real authority on the subject in our midst . 
  also , giving an example of a terrorist that did use the refugee crisis clearly does not demonstrate systematic use . 
  well actually it is just an assumption by europol . 
  and you might not want to hear this , but :  the director of europol said there was no evidence of isis ` systematically ' using the refugee crisis source : [ independent ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/isis-up-to-5000-jihadists-in-europe-after-returning-from-terror-training-camps-daesh-islamic-state-a6885961.html ) or if you want to read the german interview with the director himself , you can find it [ here ] ( http://www.noz.de/deutschland-welt/politik/artikel/672398/europol-grosste-terrorgefahr-seit-mehr-als-zehn-jahren ) . 
   they come with syrian passports , but speak no syrian is this some sort of figure of speech , or do you mean syrian dialects ? 
  there is no syrian language , they primarily speak arabic . 
  wait , which attack was that again ? 
  well the imam is a woman , which is a huge difference . 
  i believe they can still give them loads of antibiotics by saying it 's to prevent diseases instead of just for growth , but i 'm not sure about that . 
  well , using antibiotics as a growth promoter has been banned by the eu since 2006 . 
   an eu-wide ban on the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feed enters into effect on january 1 , 2006 . 
  the last 4 antibiotics which have been permitted as feed additives to help fatten livestock will no longer be allowed to be marketed or used from this date . 
  the ban is the final step in the phasing out of antibiotics used for non-medicinal purposes . 
  it is part of the commission 's overall strategy to tackle the emergence of bacteria and other microbes resistant to antibiotics , due to their overexploitation or misuse . 
  [ source ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-05-1687_en.htm ), 
  this is n't about the number of people , but the ratio between old and young people . 
  well the pegida articles are n't like what zereddd describes either ( [ example 1 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30870423 ) [ example 2 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30685842 ) ) , except when there were clashes with police . 
  but why show photos of peaceful protesters when the article is n't even about them ? 
  like [ this article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35514855 ) currently on the frontpage of the bbc ? 
  bbc did n't even report about this particular rally . 
  because they want to spread terror , saying that they are sending a lot of militants disguised as refugees is very effective in making people afraid . 
  isis uses a lot of propaganda and blindly believing them would be naive . 
  a confirmation by a third party actually is very meaningful . 
  keep in mind that a lot of people are desperate . 
  a couple of thousands leaving ? 
  well even if that 's true , it 's just a very small subset of all the refugees/migrants or whatever you want to call them . 
  it 's bizarre how unhappy citizens of athens are . 
  they score very low on [ everything ] ( http://imgur.com/a/aea3t ) . 
  is n't that a more recent source ? 
  because the numbers are n't quite the same ( and hugely different in the case of athens ) . 
  [ table from 2012 survey ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gy91dbu.png ) edit : [ album with all results from the survey ] ( http://imgur.com/a/aea3t ), 
  these stereotypes are negative though . 
  unless you think it 's completely normal to depict black people to be from some ancient tribe where they have golden earrings . 
  it has used to ridicule those people so do n't act surprised when someone takes offence . 
  til in iran jews have a seat reserved in parliament . 
  where did he even remotely say that ? 
  belgium arms exports are dwarfed by german exports . 
  germany is number 5 exporter of the world . 
  belgium does n't even make top 15 . https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/arms_industry, 
  almost nobody thinks that in the netherlands . 
  same with van gogh . 
   transsexuality in iran is legal if accompanied by a sex change operation , with iran carrying out more sex-change operations than any other country in the world after thailand . 
  wow , that 's what i call unexpected . 
  maybe you 're being downvoted because it 's an extreme hyperbole ? 
  over a quarter million people have been killed in syria , many have been tortured . 
  many of these were civilians . 
  markets and hospitals have been bombed . 
  but yeah , surely , that 's about as bad as it is in slovakia . 
  i wonder benin is not impacted by terrorism . 
  you 'd expect at least some impact for a country bordering nigeria , especially because they have some troops fighting boko haram . 
  boko haram is on the opposite side of nigeria , but still . 
  according to the dutch foreign ministry the border with nigeria is quite porous . 
  fortunately , the netherlands has a more sane electoral system than the uk . 
  sex trafficking is part of pakistani culture ? 
  yeah really weird . 
  it 's almost like cologne is a hot topic right now and the press is all over it . 
  well pakistanis are n't arabs . 
  why does that make you doubt it ? 
  if you shout that you 're even more likely to be shot . 
  you 're thinking about [ tax deduction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_deduction ) instead of [ deductible ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deductible ) . 
  i do n't think the term ` home doctor ' is used in english . 
  you mean a general practitioner ( gp ) . 
  it actually does happen tough . 
  the biggest party in geldermalsen is a local party and they started in 2002 . 
  most places have a couple of local parties that come and go because it 's so easy to start one . 
  it actually is very easy . 
  as long as the name of your party follows some trivial requirements , you do some simple paperwork , register at the chamber of commerce and pay 112,50 euros you 're good to go . 
  [ dutch source ] ( https://www.kiesraad.nl/artikel/gr-registreren-naam-partij-0 ) obvisouly this is contrary to national politics . 
  which still rarely happens . 
  crime has been [ falling quite steadily ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/menu/themas/veiligheid-recht/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2015/steeds-minder-nederlanders-ervaren-criminaliteit-onveiligheidsgevoelens-en-overlast-in-de-buurt.htm ) in the netherlands eventhough everybody seems to act like it 's the end of times . 
  well , if a municipality does n't agree with a refugee center coming to town it 's not coming . 
  geldermalsen choose to take in these refugees for the money . 
  then just start your own local party . 
  it really is n't that hard , especially in a town of 26k people . 
  why ? 
  it 's their on municipal council that decided to do this . 
  it is n't like the government can force a town to take in refugees . 
  most of them ( including this one ) do it for the money it brings in . 
  it was ? 
  many ` refugees ' did n't get any asylum in the first place . 
  oh yeah that certainly is a problem . 
  however , when you insert a usb stick and your computer gets infected , an exploit has been used . 
  this obviously is n't intended behaviour and could be fixed by installing a newer os that still gets its security updates . 
  i 'd argue the opposite . 
  older operating systems like xp do n't get any security patches from microsoft anymore unless you pay a huge chunk of money . 
  and also that support probably will end in the future . 
  still not very safe considering stuxnet used usb sticks . 
  this is just for short-stay though . 
   there literally 3 conflicts where muslims are n't present in the least 40 years .
