  now correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  they were almost no muslims in rwanda . 
  only 2 % of rwanda is muslim . 
  this obviously was a very serious conflict . 
  thanks . 
  that gives a lot more context . 
  why do the laws in saudi arabia matter ? 
  both laws are crazy if you ask me . 
  ~ ~ source ? ~ ~ [ source ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/26/world/meast/turkey-syria-plane/ ), 
  why does it matter who funds the group ? 
  source on qatar ? 
  we have [ europol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europol ) . 
  i do n't really know much about them but they do n't seem like a powerful organization . 
  yes , very confusing . 
  maybe your idea of sweden was exaggerated ? 
  who would 've thought ? 
  why do you think injection is more cruel than other methods ? 
  there is a ban on export of drugs used for executions . 
  the us apperently was quite dependent on those drugs . 
  [ interesting article ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/02/can-europe-end-the-death-penalty-in-america/283790/ ), 
  they can only block illegal websites . 
  so it depends on your local laws . 
  it happens more often than you might think . 
  there have been nineteen prosecutions between 2000 and 2012 , where half of those people were convicted . 
  the most notorious conviction was someone who was jailed for 5 months for throwing a tealight holder at the queen 's coach during * prinsjesdag * . 
  not sure why , but in the end he was in jail for 1.5 years . 
  source ? 
  oh come on , it really is not that bad . 
  remember acta ? 
  that should have been huge for ` the highest bidder ' . 
   the full european parliament voted on the issue on 4 july 2012 and declined consent to acta , effectively rejecting it , with 478 against to 39 in favour , and 165 abstentions . 
  i do n't think many people think this , especially when they 're interested in this topic . 
  assad falling would give a huge amount of unstability , but he still is a ruthless dictator and syrians deserve a better leader . 
  that 's why people want him to fall . 
  not to end this war . 
  it 's why all this started in the first place . 
  i was referring to countries that have a more christian tradition , since a lot of people feel threatened by the large amount of muslims seeking asylum there . 
  i totally agree , but i just do n't see that happening . 
  an islamic state in europe ? 
  you 'd need a * lot * of muslims for that with political representation that want to enforce islamic law on everyone in the first place . 
  is there even a county with an islamic political party with seats in parliament ? 
  it 's not that bad . 
  you usually live in a compound that is quite luxurious and western . 
  just do n't break the local laws and you 'll be fine . 
  not only brussels but every eu country  it is now set to announce an expansion of the reading rooms beyond the european parliament to all eu countries and selected national representatives . 
  the representatives allowed to see the papers will be chosen by their governments . 
    euractiv understands that the move is to ensure politicians in eu countries are better informed of the process , and do n't have to travel to brussels to the reading rooms in the european commission 's offices . 
  the question was if greece got any money regarding the refugee crisis . 
  you ca n't just say oh well we only get 32 mln from the eu , which simply is n't true . 
  you guys get a lot of money from the fund i mentioned and apparently even more from some emergency fund . 
  you also get about 166 mln for border protection from [ another fund ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/financing/fundings/security-and-safeguarding-liberties/internal-security-fund-borders/index_en.htm ) . 
  you know you get 260 mln but decided to go with 32 mln ? 
   was greece given money to help them ? 
  every country in the eu gets money from the * asylum , migration and integration fund * [ table ] ( https://i.imgur.com/nhrptln.png ), 
  greece gets much more money from the eu through the * asylum , migration and integration fund * . 
  about 260 million euros . 
  [ table ] ( https://i.imgur.com/nhrptln.png ) [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/financing/fundings/pdf/overview/regulation_eu_no_5162014_of_the_european_parliament_and_of_the_council_en.pdf ) ( page 192 ), 
  you would n't consider fp\u00d6 to be far-right ? 
  that 's quite a big difference , choosing not to do it or making it illegal, 
  it should be respected but not seen as the truth , especially in a field as economics . 
  the guy is n't some sort of oracle . 
  that 's not the point . 
  being a nobel laureate gives an unreasonable amount of prestige to scientists . 
  source ? 
  is satellite tv banned in syria ? 
  i remember watching dutch tv there 15 years ago in damascus . 
  so it was just some speculation on your part about my views ? 
  ironically my comment was a hyperbole as well , of course there are articles written about this . 
  but they do n't nearly get as much traction or are as interesting to many people . 
  where did you see me call `` the big bad media '' `` a hotbed of racism '' ? 
   and saying thank you to their hosts once in a while would n't hurt either . 
  this happens all the time . 
  but nobody is going to write an article about that . 
  well it 's from de telegraaf , so take it with a grain of salt . 
  just fyi , al-nusra renamed itself to jabhat fateh al-sham . 
  shooting down those russian planes does not sound like a good idea . 
  sure , the bombing sucks but you ca n't just say that would have solved the problem . 
  also it is very unclear what effect a no fly zone would have . 
  i do n't really understand the reason to be strongly against this . 
  if you really do n't want to donate your organs , you can just opt-out . 
  i 'm not sure if this is a joke or not . 
  but it 's really not odd for a woman to want feel pretty and getting her hair done . 
  if you 're in the middle east you see lots of women going to beauty salons etc. 
  even if they 're wearing a niqab . 
  freedom of religion is . 
  yes that is tolerable . 
  what the taliban does is completely irrelevant . 
  making it mandatory to wear a burqa is unacceptable . 
  if someone wants to wear a burqa , there is no reason that person should n't be allowed . 
  i do n't want a country where you 're not allowed to wear what you want . 
  i do n't want to give up freedoms because people are scared . 
  not only does it betray western values , it also solves absolutely nothing . 
  i do n't think it 's right for the women , but it surely is n't right for individual freedom and freedom of religion . 
  there is a difference between not banning and supporting . 
  it 's also the people who absolutely despise political correctness . 
  but if you do n't conform to their views you are downvoted or ridiculed . 
  i you left because of mean comments you really need to rethink your voting strategies . 
  but we 're not discussing about how bad islam is here . 
  how is this even relevant ? 
  your views may or may not be grounded , it does n't matter .
