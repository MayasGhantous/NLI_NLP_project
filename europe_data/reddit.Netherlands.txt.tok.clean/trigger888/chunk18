  or at least not to post selfies of whatever it is they 're doing there . 
  or maybe this is all meant to generate discussion about selfie whoredom . 
  agreed . 
  the artist expressly offered to remove the photos at the request of the people in them . 
  i do n't know what else he can do . 
  these people were stupid enough to post online selfies of themselves doing something disrespectful . 
  whether that disrespect was unwitting or not does n't really matter . 
  they ca n't be surprised by the fallout . 
  there is at least one guy who apologized online . 
  well , then , they can apply to google . 
  sorry , but if you put a photo on the internet , you no longer have control over it . 
  but why would you show up there if you do n't know what it is ? 
  it 's out of the way . 
  i 'm pretty sure everyone knows why they are walking to this particular memorial . 
  it 's not a grave site . 
  you apparently do n't know what it is either . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.answer123.com/gallery3/var/albums/germany-2011/img_0867-berlin_jewish_holocaust_memorial.jpg?m=1385591471 ) is what it is . 
  every single person who goes there knows , or finds out quickly enough , exactly what it is . 
  it 's [ huge ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/holocaust_memorial_berlin.jpg ) . 
  you ca n't be mistaken about what this is . 
  anyone who takes selfies in a european art gallery is also a guilty asshole . 
  this [ selfie mania ] ( http://photomediationsmachine.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/pointless-selfies.png ) is ridiculous . 
  respect privacy ? 
  they posted these pictures on the fucking internet . 
  would you play in a holocaust playground ? 
  would n't you restrain yourself ? 
  the point is that there are idiots who would play in a holocaust playground . 
  perhaps they do n't know what the holocaust was . 
  perhaps they do n't care . 
  the reason for their behavior does n't matter . 
  they 're still idiots . 
  there are `` sacred '' spaces everywhere . 
  situations were selfies should not be taken . 
  tourists ignoring them is a problem [ everywhere . 
  ] ( http://images.gawker.com/18rb1bnh3lts0jpg/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800.jpg ), 
  maybe the architect knew it would be disrespected and would lead to debates like this . 
  he wants us to be offended . 
  would you take a selfie of yourself crawling around a holocaust memorial ? 
   i keep liking more naive people that celebrates life this is a good point . 
  i see what you 're saying here . 
  but still ... 
  they are guilty . 
  they are assholes . 
  anyone with any clue at all would understand the context of these memorials and act accordingly . 
  would you crawl all over a holocaust memorial ?? 
  nor would i. 
  but here we have people who would . 
  and i think the hordes who take selfies in art galleries should be kicked out and banned for a year . 
  these people posted their pictures online themselves . 
  and he does say that he will remove their pic if they contact him . 
  what country is this ? 
  yeah , no . 
   i just do n't understand why you could n't find a better place to take your stupid selfie than at a memorial remembering 6 million deaths because this is [ our world ] ( http://www.familyadventureproject.org/wp-content/uploads/dsc01204.jpg ) now, 
  ~ ~ and whoever made this website is also an asshole . ~ ~ wrong . 
  he made his point brilliantly . 
  have you ever gone to a european art gallery ? 
  the fucking selfies -- omg , it never stops . 
  this insane need to take one 's photo everywhere ... 
  i think he 's made his point brilliantly, 
  what do n't you understand ? 
  it 's not meant to be disrespectful , but it is . 
  the same story reported by a credible english language source : http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/01/a-low-crime-rate-dutch-police-are-unaware-of-most-crimes-says-leaked-report/, 
  this article is mostly about the uk . 
  it has some ( negative ) things to say about europe , but its perspective is `` what should britain do '' . 
  it 's a joke , for chrissakes . 
  i didnt mean it seriously he joked with me . 
  i responded in kind . 
  it 's a joke !, 
  admit it !, 
  how many rubles has he paid you ? 
  our agenda is world domination , achieved peacefully through trade . 
  eat our cucumbers !, 
   what 's wrong with anti-establishment parties ? 
  [ this ] ( http://start1g.ovh.net/~lesfilmsx/fr/img/heim6.jpg ), 
  i do n't think may actually does want to leave . 
  she 's doing it because that 's her job now . 
  we need to be vigilant about that here on / r/europe as well . 
  russians are pushing their agenda here . 
  their strategy is to undermine our trust in the msm and in other democratic institutions and to promote populist and other anti-establishment parties . 
  do you agree then that the only turkish news media worth consuming are s\u00f6zc\u00fc , ayd\u0131nl\u0131k and birg\u00fcn ? 
  they are non-islamist , secular , balanced , western in outlook , etc. 
  the rest are not worth consuming because they are too afraid to report honestly on political stories or issues involving erdogan . 
  or they are outright owned by erdogan family members or supporters . 
  i think you 're supporting erdogan . 
  you 're asking me to read news published by a news outlet owned by erdogan 's son . 
  are you telling me there are media outlets in turkey willing to publish the truth about erdogan ? 
  it 's not about the news anymore . 
  it 's about what source you can trust . 
  the fake news sources are publishing a mix of real and fake news . 
  and it 's also about not supporting the fake news factories . 
  yeah , it has to be within reason . 
  immigration and multiculturalism within reason . 
  no , i do n't want stockholm to become mogadishu , but it would n't be so bad to have some somalis there . 
  good point . 
  you could also argue that there are many positive feelings about immigrants in france and the netherlands . 
  but how do you account for young people disproportionately wanting to vote for populist parties ? 
  what has happened to them ? 
  but every media outlet in turkey supports a dictator . 
  everyone is terrified there now . 
  freedom of the press no longer exists there .
