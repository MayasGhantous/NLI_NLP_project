   the uk might even rejoin then if the uk leaves , it leaves for good . 
  it wo n't be allowed back in . 
   the idea that the pvv will get an absolute super majority on its own is virtually impossible , seeing how it has never happened before . 
  sorry , still too fat , too many guns , too religious , too crazy . 
  no , there 's only the jungle, 
  omg how dare the americans make fun of eurovision !, 
   things worked much better when we owned it . 
  not . 
  the british left a mess in every country they ruled . 
  pakistan v. india . 
  ( how many died ? ), 
  american slavery . 
  aborigine genocide all over the world . 
  boer concentration camps . 
  divided ireland . 
  hey , dictator erdogan , congratulations on turning your country into a shithole in only ten years . 
  they 're not offered a choice . 
  they 're refusing to go to the country assigned to them . 
  surely you do n't think the greeks and turks are equal in blameworthiness for what happened in cyprus ? 
  only one country recognizes the existence of northern cyprus -- and that is [ turkey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_relations_of_northern_cyprus ) . 
  for the turks to do this is to rub salt in the wound . 
  when you say `` capital '' and `` capital owners '' you make it sound like you 're not one of them . 
  surely you have your own business , or you own shares , or you hold equity of some kind ? 
  if not , why not ? 
  probably because you 're young . 
  but if you 're over 30 , stop complaining and start reaping the benefits of capitalism . 
  i 'm so sorry . 
  your country had a bright future , but now it 's becoming another middle eastern shithole . 
  it 's heartbreaking . 
  god how gullible are you ? 
   what has happened to turkey ? 
  nothing happened . 
  it 's a muslim country , that 's all . 
  they tried to become normal , but it did n't work . 
  erdogan has been fucking us around with regard to everything . 
  is that really necessary ? 
  i generally like turkey and the turks , but they can be such chauvinist cunts sometimes . 
  ok , would n't it be `` disdain '' rather than `` do not deign '' ? 
  and i 'm thinking that `` devoirs '' here means something like `` tasks '' or `` obligations '' or even `` projects '' . 
  this is what i make of it :  beware of these sophisticates who will go to far-off countries to look for projects they would disdain to do at home . 
  absurd, 
  slovenia is worth a visit . 
  beautiful ... um , little country . 
  oh it 's hypocritical . 
  let a south african tv crew into denmark and see if they can find anything to be outraged over . 
  do n't forget to factor in the easy availability of guns in the us . 
  if guns were made easily available in europa , millions would die in 2 days, 
  mass shootings occur in europe all the time . 
  the only difference is in the availability of guns, 
  crazy is crazy, 
  utter rubbish, 
  surely these newscasters were ... [ cough , cough ] ... selected for something other than their language skills, 
  it 's true ;-) we spend our days in lounge chairs looking at the rats on the treadmill, 
  um , except in recent years in norway , paris , belgian trains , [ munich ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/world/europe/munich-mall.html?_r=1 ) , all over russia and all the time , finland , the uk . 
  oh for god 's sake apartheid ended 30 years ago . 
  what more do you want them to do ? 
  south africa now has a corrupt government and the highest crime rate in the world . 
  you could find [ `` modern slavery '' in denmark ] ( http://cphpost.dk/news/national/modern-day-slavery.html ) too if you knew where to look . 
  so hypocritical . 
  ban danish ... um , ... danishes !, 
  it means romanians dont need to apply for tourist visas in advance . 
  i would like to point out that some of the fun aspects of hallowe'en are actually found in the sinterklaas celebrations on 5 december , although the two feast days are not linked in any way . 
  the dressing up in costumes , disguises , excited kids , candy , and so on . 
  in some places kids go around on 11 nov ( st martin 's day ) and sing a song in exchange for candy . 
  the `` culture wars '' have spread to every country . 
  everyone thinks he 's an expert now . 
  lol, 
  the poles are massively well represented in the hotel and restaurant sector . 
  i love them . 
  the guys are hot . 
  but god there are far too many in the uk . 
  yes, 
  when i go to the uk , i only meet poles . 
  they 're working extensively in the horeca . 
  she 's actually centre-left , but i can see why the far left would characterize her as centre-right . 
  ok , figure of speech ... how many is it really ? 
  1.5 million ? 
  there 's nothing polite about this language . 
  [ why did they all go to calais then ? 
  why did n't they stop in greece , italy , spain or france ? 
  ] ( http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2016/02/unnamed-25.jpg ), 
  of course , i get that . 
  not sure it 's completely true , but i understand what you 're saying . 
  bernie sanders is a democrat , for example . 
  centrists do n't use the word `` neoliberalism '' . 
  i 've been following the american politics a little bit . 
  i 'm really struck at the political discourse in the united states . 
  it did n't used to be like this . 
  something has changed in the us . 
  they have polarized and become entrenched in two opposing camps who refuse to compromise with each other or even talk to each other . 
  when a user here calls a pro-gay politician an `` idiot '' and `` borderline retarded '' -- something i do n't normally associate with european politicians -- i wonder about whether the `` pro-gay '' part had an influence on it . 
  germans normally are n't that passionate about politicians ( well , at least the mainstream ones i know ) . 
  so i 'm wondering what maas did -- apart from being pro-gay -- to merit this . 
  it had something to do with rape laws and consent laws . 
  i do n't know anything about that . 
  why would any german give a shit about the rape laws or consent laws ? 
  is there something wrong with the current laws ? 
  another poster called him `` useless '' . 
  why is maas useless ? 
  do they ?
