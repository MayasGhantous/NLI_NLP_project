  if we given in to extremism , we 'll end up with le pen , wilders and the afd in charge of europe . 
  she is not single-handedly holding europe together , but without her i 'm not sure the eu is going to survive . 
  she is an effective centrist , which means she is a beacon of sanity in europe right now . 
  there was no far left movement , so how is it an opposite reaction ? 
  look at the posters here in this sub ... dozens of eastern europeans spending their days posting anti-immigrant shit posts , strategically voting to promote only their views / r/europe has become a place where they find like-minded posters and they can get away with racist , populist crap, 
  i think you have a vested interest in the pakistani community in the uk . 
  how many of them are returning home regularly for visits ? 
  what are you , 12 years old ? 
  good comment . 
  i suspect most of the downvotes came from ee posters . 
  apparently , in the new eu , it 's ok to be openly racist . 
  it would have been a different map . 
  italy has a long history in that part of the world . 
  it 's just racist . 
  what ? 
  [ maybe this will help ] ( https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a0%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b7%d1%8a%d0%bc ), 
  look up at the map at the top of this page . 
  it 's just open , naked racism . 
  it 's not funny . 
  are we at the point where racism is now openly expressed and everything thinks it 's normal and funny ? 
  no , the trek through the balkans came first . 
  remember ? 
  moron was merkel supposed to let them all amass at the order in austria ? 
  in croatia ? 
  in hungary ? 
  in czechia ? 
  let them wander through europe ? 
  it 's true about the racism though . 
  it was the first article that came up when i googled `` italians are racist '' . 
  and it 's not just the british . 
  here is a [ dutch-language blog ] ( http://italie.blog.nl/human-interest/2010/01/05/voor-een-zwarte-in-italie-is-racisme-dagelijkse-kost ) saying the same thing . 
  look at this ridiculous thread , calling the southern part of italy `` ethiopia '' or `` somalia '' -- and expecting that we are going to laugh at it . 
  racist , racist , racist . 
  downvote me if you must , you eastern european trolls , but it is not witty racist or even subtly racist . 
  it is ugly unsophisticated racist . 
  canada has resources . 
  more than the us . 
  canada is like the cool smart sister who has a good job and shares ; america is like the big , slightly retarded goof brother who bullied the neighbourhood but is now trying to become a cop . 
  [ why is italy still so racist ? 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/jul/30/italy-racism-cecile-kyenge-esterofilia ), 
  tl/dr : `` dont be so nationalist '', 
  what choice do we have really ? 
  we 're at the heart of it, 
  you 're welcome !, 
  eat our huge , perfectly shaped cucumber !, 
  yeah everyone figured that out, 
  lol -- two years ? 
  and this was your takeaway ? 
  like it or not , migrants are news , especially when they commit outrageous crimes in front of a camera . 
  even the bbc ( hardly a hotbed of populism ) sees that . 
  we are about to watch a wave of populist election victories in europe in 2017 . 
  this vid explains why . 
  then why is it on the bbc europe section ? 
  no it 's a big story in the german news . 
  i think the left in the us do n't really appreciate what 's happened to them . 
  well , maybe the nyt and its readers should focus on their own country . 
  or are they going to argue that they are the `` good germans '' . 
  that 's the right metaphor : liberal germans in nazi germany criticizing british politics . 
  the left in your country are going to find it difficult to accept that your nation is now fascist , and this fascism has an effect on them . 
  is it going too far to say that , by electing trump , your country ( including its media and people ) have forfeited the right to comment critically on the rest of the world 's politics ? 
  yeah , just wait 20 years and do it then . 
  but this time it will be a referendum to join . 
  i 'm sure the eu will tell you to fuck off though . 
   all politicians lie , everywhere . 
  well , no , not really . 
  not like your politicians . 
  trump said today that the whole `` lock her up '' thing was , well , just something that had to be said before the election . 
  the lying is breathtaking . 
  cnn is reporting a different lie every day . 
  do you see the hypocrisy ? 
  your president-elect ( ostensibly a billionaire fascist ) got elected on the basis of outrageous lies and `` fake news '' . 
  not unlike hitler . 
  * mexicans are rapists . 
  i will prosecute hillary clinton . 
  i will build a wall . 
  i will drain the swamp . 
  i will undo every law introduced by obama . 
  i will help the average white guy . 
  * and so on ad nauseam . 
  your free speech laws allowed this to happen . 
  they created a climate that made fake news and brazen lying acceptable . 
  and yet , here you are , you 're defending american free speech laws . 
  you say `` all politicians lie '' . 
  how can you say this ? 
  even if it 's true , how can you present it as something normal ? 
  open your eyes . 
  unlimited free speech leads to a disorderly society that allows fascists to flourish . 
  look at all the right wing hate now flowing from the us to the rest of the world . 
  breitbart is going to start publishing in french and german . 
  i can think of two things that the current dutch pm said he would do , and has n't . 
  but it was n't lying on his part . 
  it just was n't really possible to follow through . 
  * he acknowledged it and apologised for it . 
  * wilders may get a majority of the votes . 
  this will be a shock to our nation and cause a sensation to the english-speaking media , which thrives on this kind of drama and will no doubt foam feverishly at the mouth . 
  but he will not be able to form a coalition with a majority because no one will work with him . 
  in the united states , however , are the republicans and others refusing to work with trump ? 
  ( sorry , this last one is admittedly an unfair dig . 
  it has nothing to do with freedom of expression . ), 
  do you think canada or european countries `` suppress '' free expression ?
