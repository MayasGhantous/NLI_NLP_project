  do you think the same issues wo n't arise ? 
  do you think the left in your country is going to oppose the deal any less ? 
  [ the us is not the uk 's largest trading partner . 
  the eu is . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_united_kingdom ) you 're just blithely making stuff up . 
  bullshitting . 
  making incorrect statements . 
  fuck , i love reddit . 
  i 'm blocking you . 
  both sides were n't lying ffs . 
  people did not know . 
  edit : who is upvoting this post ? 
   being able to make our own trade deals with who ? 
  about what ? 
  what the uk needs right now is real leadership . 
  maybe the uk should stop selling arms to saudi arabia then, 
  yes , it was a massive blunder, 
  biggest blunder in uk history ... but , hey , 51 % of the voters wanted it -- after they were viciously lied to and blatantly manipulated . 
  the last two tory pms have been against it , but do n't let that stop the tories from leading the lemmings, 
  please do n't post anything from the telegraph .

  yeah , `` dating '' ... 
   our media was crucifying trump trump is crucifying himself . 
  lol it 's all in english there are two dutch sentences in there : `` join the largest cruising site now '' and `` get one year for free '', 
  denekamp is easy to find . 
  it 's just a little further than almelo . 
  or you could always go through hengelo , of course . 
  if you end up in agelo , you 're completely lost . 
  this is shit blogging . 
  plus , it has nothing to do with europe . 
  can i be brutally honest with you ? 
  you 're only coming for ~ ~ eight ~ ~ nine days . 
  the first and last day are your travel days . 
  so you really will have ~ ~ six ~ ~ seven full days . 
  am i right ? 
  i assume you 're travelling by train or bus ? 
  if you 're going to travel copenhagen --  hamburg --  amsterdam --  berlin --  copenhagen , you wo n't have time to do anything . 
  really , nothing at all . 
  it 's just too much . 
  you ca n't see that much in only seven days . 
  you wo n't `` immerse '' in anything . 
  another issue : if you 're going to party in the evening ( which seems to be part of your plan ) , you wo n't be able or willing to do much in the morning . 
  how are you going to get in anything outdoorsy or sports-oriented ? 
  you wo n't have the time or ability to leave the cities you 're visiting . 
  my suggestion is to spend it all in copenhagen . 
  you 'll get to know copenhagen well . 
  `` immerse '' in copenhagen . 
  find the best hostel you can . 
  find a good pub or club to hang out in . 
  get to know the neighbourhood . 
  make danish friends . 
  meet danish girls . 
  get to know danish food and beer . 
  take side trips to sweden , viking museums and hamlet 's castle . 
  explore around . 
  see what events are on . 
  do n't miss the [ harbor festival ] ( http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/harbour-festival-kulturhavn-festival-gdk414389 ) 25-27 aug. 
  this [ rock festival ] ( http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/friday-rock-gdk474730 ) on friday , for example . 
  ( 5 seconds of summer ) go to this [ carlsberg bbq ] ( http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/carlsberg-fridays-gdk1008836 ) on friday . 
  you 'll be too late for pride , but there is a party on the 20th . 
  as for sports and outdoors , rent some bikes and bike around that part of denmark . 
  it 's got great cycling there . 
  go to a football game . 
  check [ this ] ( http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/swoop-freestyle-world-championships-copenhagen-gdk1007136 ) out . 
  yes , the pleasure of anal sex is not just from the prostate . 
  the anus is a remarkably sensitive organ . 
  and of course the intense intimacy of it . 
  and my comment was not overblown . 
  the poster posted something inaccurate about it . 
  i corrected him . 
  but i did n't expect it to get upvoted because this sub is overrun with eastern europeans . 
  mmm , cotton swabs in the ear make me sneeze . 
  it does feel nice though . 
  gay men have anal sex because it 's seriously pleasurable . 
  evolution has developed this for a reason . 
  the asshole has not only been engineered for sex , but it 's been * perfectly * and * specifically * engineered for * amazing * sex . 
  if you 've never tried it yourself , just look at what is going on in any good gay porn video . 
  philosophers have argued for millennia over which type of sex is more pleasurable for human beings , but there is no doubt that anal sex ( including that between men ) is at least as pleasurable for both parties as vaginal sex . 
  it 's absurd to say that `` the vagina was made for sex and the anus not '' . 
  similarly , even though gay people can not have children , straight people continue to produce gay offspring . 
  there is no grand design , of course , but if there were , you would think that homosexuality was part of it . 
  yeah , `` degenerate '' ... 
  i could say the same thing about stupidity, 
  of course , the asshole has been developed by evolution for sex . 
  why else would it be sexually pleasurable then ? 
  the hand was n't made for reproduction either, 
  `` the media '' is owned by billionaires and corporations, 
  wrong, 
  wrong, 
  [ this ad ] ( http://www.bandt.com.au/information/uploads/2016/01/squirt-ad-419x500.jpg ) was all over the amsterdam transit system, 
  yeah , well , i 'm not the one describing american food as `` poison '', 
  the bloody hypocrisy of a german describing american food as poison, 
  lol [ german food ] ( http://germanculture.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/german-food.jpg ), 
  the article in a nutshell :  but hungarians are furious at what they see as the arrogant way in which bkk and t\u2011systems handled the fact that an 18-year-old discovered an enormous flaw in their website and reported that fact to them . 
  i think it 's outrageous . 
  this kid did the right thing and reported it immediately , but they treated him like a hacker and had him arrested . 
  i do n't disagree with you . 
  these things were all known to the architects who put it all together . 
  it 's not like any of this is new .
