  calculated risks were taken . 
  it 's a grand project with an uncertain outcome . 
  what i 'm pointing out is the * negativity * of this commentary . 
  i suppose it 's a cultural thing . 
  the english and american media are filled with chattering `` experts '' , excited journalists , doomsayers , sensationalists and vitriol spewers , especially when it comes to anything not connected to them . 
  europeans just do n't have this . 
  also , these comments are made as if europeans cared what the english-speaking chattering classes had to say about the euro or the eu . 
  it 's amusing and annoying that you think we do . 
  europe is huge , diverse , dynamic , flexible , changing . 
  something i 'm sure you 've noticed . 
  it takes risks . 
  it is constantly reforming and improving . 
  the english-speaking countries are , on the other hand , sort of stuck . 
  constitutional , structural and currency reforms just do n't happen in these countries . 
  i do n't know why . 
  maybe it 's because you 've got a reactive government system rather than a proactive , planning-oriented one . 
  every so often you see a spurt of action . 
  but not often . 
  i suppose you 'll call this stability . 
  and , really , do your economists have everything figured out ? 
  i do n't think so at all . 
  i would say they have absolutely nothing figured out . 
  europe is a pretty amazing place to live for almost a half billion people . 
  can you say that for the uk and the us ? 
  so jstfu when it comes to the euro . 
  it 's doing fine . 
  it will survive . 
  the eu is smarter and better than the us or the uk . 
  we were mastering imperial organisation before either country even existed . 
  we know what we 're doing . 
  we do n't need the self-important english-speaking world ( which appears to be in self-destruct mode anyway ) to comment on it , certainly not negatively . 
  if you admire europe and wish the best for the euro countries , feel free to express those sentiments . 
  the word is `` fallacies '' , not `` falacies '' . 
  but hey you 're the one with the superior education . 
  i 'm going to end the conversation . 
  it 's frustrating to talk to people like you . 
  i feel like i 'm talking to a hitler supporter in 1938 . 
  you are blinded and twisted by ideology . 
  you think obama is a `` warmongerer '' ? 
  he promised to pull americans out of iraq , and he actually did it . 
  he also kept american ground troops out of syria . 
  how is that being a warmonger ? 
  obama was the opposite of a warmonger . 
  it 's too early to say how many people will die as a result of trump 's foolish nonsense . 
  if he takes away everyone 's health care , it could be millions . 
  if he starts a war with north korea or iran , it could be millions . 
  the man wants to build a wall and keep out immigrants . 
  that alone makes him a monster . 
  a wall is ridiculous . 
  the sanctuary cities should be allowed to help immigrants . 
  immigrants are a good thing . 
  but even if i sidestep for a moment the inherent racism in your comment and address your point head on , he is n't even going to build the wall . 
  he is n't going after the sanctuary cities . 
  he ca n't do these things . 
  they are impossible . 
  he lied about doing that . 
  he is just saying things that will make people like you support him . 
  he 's lying to you . 
  he did n't win fairly . 
  the man lied . 
  and lied . 
  and lied . 
  and lied . 
  he even lied about other people lying . 
  it 's quite absurd . 
  his supporters lied even more . 
  at one point , one of his supporters , armed with a gun , went into a pizza place in washington to find a child-abuse ring . 
  you could n't make it up . 
  how is that fair ? 
  the other candidates are more moral people who were unwilling to lie so brazenly . 
  besides , clinton got 3 million more votes . 
  the american system is unfair and fucked up . 
  obama was a great president . 
  bush was dumb , but he was n't a liar . 
  how can you say that given his six months of bungling ? 
  never mind all his other insurmountable , serious faults , which make him unfit for any kind of public service at all . 
  the man is like a bond villain . 
  `` dark world of politics '' -- i do n't even know how to respond to that . 
  what on earth could have happened to make you feel this way about `` politics '' ? 
  not really . 
  i just think trump is an evil clown . 
  and your support for him is nauseating . 
  name-calling . 
  you 're blocked . 
  enjoy your dialogues with others , because ours has forever ended . 
  sigh ... ok , i 'll find some of the eastern european ones . 
  i did n't realise that by `` bigot '' you were referring specifically to my comments about eastern europeans . 
  the problem is that most of the racist points are being made by eastern europeans . 
  there is no way i can prove that point statistically , so the onus is on you to prove that i 'm wrong . 
  i 'm surprised you like anything , given that your nose is so far up trump 's asshole . 
  get out of there . 
  look around . 
  smell the fresh air .

  what nonsense . 
  example of nationalist post : https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6p7s0b/how_do_you_see_the_eu_changing_in_the_next_century/dkn930a/, 
  stronger , unified defence system . 
  even more unified economies . 
  every european country entering ( or re-entering ) the fold . 
  the eu slowly and organically becoming one of the world 's superpowers and a beacon of liberalism , democracy and globalism .
