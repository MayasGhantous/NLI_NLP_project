  if the fight is lost then a few states will keep running tax rates to the absolute bottom . 
  this is a problem with companies , not with silicon valley . 
  on the issue of ignoring europe , i am not sure . 
  the rest of the world is pretty big , they can just go there first and when they dominate the market , they can slowly figure out on what conditions they are willing to offer their innovative service to the eu . 
  so very basically you are saying that the uk can get what the canadians got , eventually . 
  in their domestic dialogue they are just misrepresenting what ceta is , or how big any possible plus of a ceta plus could be , and how quickly they could negotiate such an agreement . 
  i did notice while looking through the ceta agreement that it says that it covers services . 
  while high value banking was n't mentioned , they do say europeans could sell insurance in canada as an example . 
  in its promotion video the eu says ceta is the most modern comprehensive trade deal yet , so it would make sense that it includes some trade in services . 
  my issue is just that while i understand the cherry picking argument as it applies to the eu , including the payments into the budget , i still do n't fully grasp why it is n't applied to the canadians . 
  it sounds like cherry picking is exactly what trade negotiators should be doing . 
  the eu is way bigger than canada and richer so we should have been able to pick a lot more cherries than they did . 
  why are n't the eu officials running around telling everyone who will listen how they took the canadians for a ride ? 
  they should have been able to do that with the cards they were dealt . 
  what is often ignored is that slave trading was a common occupation for them . 
  labor was more valuable in the east in those days , it was profitable to conduce it to move that way . 
  capturing slavic people along the route , then selling them on markets in the middle east was highly profitable . 
  that made it easier to take back gold . 
  seasonal raiding is really only profitable if your target is weak and does n't know you 're coming . 
  instead of hiding , or going elsewhere to hunt for riches , there were fortified viking positions along the river systems of modern day russia . 
  those were mainly used for steady trade and there were n't that many other things that europe had to sell to the middle east during the early middle ages . 
  thanks for the insightful reply . 
  if all the mergers and other big financial moves happened in the uk anyway , then why did the other eu 27 bother denying passporting to the swiss ? 
  it sounds like that policy only benefitted the uk . 
  while the uk kept the profits from london , the eu would have shared out the metric ton of money that the swiss offered . 
  i read some of your other posts on brexit and you seem to feel that retaining the customs union and single market access for some industries amounts to cherry picking . 
  it makes sense that the eu wo n't be charmed by that prospect . 
  seeing how the eu is n't completely helpless we can probably avoid that result . 
  i do wonder how that view can fit with ceta . 
  that too is a more limited version of market integration . 
  it must consist of limited ambitions and cherries being picked by both parties until everyone is ready to agree ( except for the walloons ) . 
  why then would n't we end up with something like that for the uk . 
  as nice as canadians are said to be , i do n't feel like there is an intrinsic reason to trade with them on better terms than with the british . 
  not everyone environmental scientists were breaking their heads trying to figure out why the eu air was n't getting cleaner when their models said it should . 
  turns out that it worked a while lot better if real numbers were used to simulate all those diesel cars . 
  i was taught that they were introduced by well educated people trying to sound fancy . 
  that 's why the cases are in none of the dialects . 
  i also looked around some on wikipedia . 
  it 's odd how often the cases keep coming up . 
  guess you ca n't really master dutch without knowing about cases , even though you sound absurdly old fashioned when you use them in common speech . 
  do you understand what a passporting right is ? 
  because i do n't . 
  i did read that the swiss do n't have passporting and they still make lots of money from their banks . 
  so perhaps passporting is n't all it 's said to be . 
  the daily mail is used to indicate shoddy journalism , so that 's sarcasm . 
  the readers of the daily mail are said to be nationalistic to the point of absurdity , so they would probably be against spending government money abroad even if it is to bribe foreigners . 
  that means that the daily mail might indeed block such an undertaking . 
  i think trade in services , including financial services , is in ceta . 
   ceta will bring new opportunities for european companies by creating access to the canadian market in key sectors such as : * financial services * telecommunications * energy * maritime transport [ that 's from the eu 's site . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/#streamlining ) in the [ summary of the final negotiation results ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/december/tradoc_152982.pdf ) they also mention financial services in chapter seven . 
  yes that 's true the dynamics of the negotiations will control a lot of what happens and canada is different from the uk . 
  for example only one of those countries has a strong maple syrup lobby . 
  still ceta might be a good place to start looking if we want to guess the post brexit situation, 
  while that is interesting for finance types , my eye was caught by this one :  [ the idea of post brexit trade is ] for britain to seek a deeper version of the canadian trade deal with the eu , to secure access to the single market for goods and services . 
  now i do n't know what exactly is in the canadian trade deal , but it should be studied closely . 
  it seems unreasonable to demand any more of the uk than we do off the canadians . 
  so what is the level of market access the canadians would get ? 
  i think it is singular , the count 's forest . 
  ** des ** is singular and ** der ** or ** deren ** is plural . 
  you say ** hertogen ** with the - en because of the genitive case when it 's a single hertog . 
  at least that 's what my language instinct says . 
  it also makes sense because brabant always had one hertog at a time . 
  i am not aware of anybody leaving nato . 
  much less of a nation being expelled from the treaty . 
  why turkey joined is hardly relevant . 
  how they would leave is and i do n't see any movement on that issue . 
  i like how you tell me i make baseless claims , then proceed to make baseless claims of your own . 
  is it perhaps because a debate with the valued users of reddit is n't worth that much effort ? 
  especially when there is nothing to gain from arguing with them , except for the mental exercise . 
  i could demonstrate my google-fu and find you sources for every claim i made , then you could bother to read all of them and make a judgement . 
  something tells me you wo n't though , even if i sacrificed the time and made the effort to supply you with source material . 
  trust me when i tell you that i do n't care enough about turkey to fantasize about political actions . 
  i got all of this from somewhere . 
  turkey is in nato , turkey is in a customs union with the eu , there were always close ties between the eu and turkey . 
  what more can they want ? 
  is that enough though ? 
  no they are seeking to influence turkish emigrants through all sorts of means . 
  why does a dutch citizen born and raised in the netherlands still get a call to mandatory military service in turkey ? 
  why does the turkish embassy feel the need to get involved if a dutch national of turkish descent is adopted by a lesbian couple ? 
  why does akp have secret funding and organizational tendrils throughout the whole turkish emigre community ? 
  turkey is a valuable ally , but not at any price . 
  playing games was one thing , but they did n't stop there . 
  the turkish state has been involved in the syrian civil war and in many ways they have helped groups hostile to the eu and fought against groups that are friendly towards us . 
  both before and after the coup attempt , erdogan has been working hard to turn turkey from a fragile democracy to a dictatorship under him . 
  then he gave himself some fucking great pr by attacking our freedom of speech . 
  most recently erdogan has started on a stalinist purge of the nation . 
  we will say what we have to say to keep the refugee deal , but that 's it . 
  this is not a story of trust or goodwill , but one that is strictly transactional . 
  turkey belongs to the turks and they are free to deal with it all by themselves . 
  i agree that their membership is questionable , but you have to consider the alternative . 
  without eu cooperation , they would have been floating around in a power vacuum , freer to do what they want , but also freer to be influenced by russia . 
  if today we were having a ukrainian situation not in ukraine , but in czechia , then we would be in trouble way more trouble . 
  0.7 % unemployment does not happen in a healthy society . 
  during world war 2 the usa had an unemployment rate of 1.5 % or more and that was a total war . 
  0.7 % unemployment is a fiction . 
  that was n't popular in most of europe . 
  the us were playing geopolitics and decided it would stabilize those countries . 
  perhaps they were right . 
  for more than twenty years the eu could reform and democratize the eastern countries , largely by promising them membership , then pushing them from within the eu . 
  that is something even if that influence has now run it 's course .
