[ that 's enough reddit for today . 
   and eating a frikandel is truly a journey into the unknown ... until you try bitterballen and your mouth learn what the fires of hell feel like . 
  whoever thought that building the utrecht ring like that was a good idea , should be burned at the stake . 
  this reminds me that i 've accidentally torn apart the first stempas i 've received after moving to the netherlands . 
  and , most importantly , that i forgot to send the papers to the italian consulate in order to be able to vote ... :(, 
  besides the fact that it was a `` contratto a progetto '' ( so far less than 1600 $ / mo before taxes ) , the job market in italy is built around what you make * after * taxes . 
  unless that has changed over the past two years , not a single job offer has ever mentioned the amount * before * taxes . 
  the offer was 800 $ / mo , let 's not try to spin this around the poor business owners . 
  besides , it 's a stupid excuse to pay low wages : [ labor cost in italy is lower than other eu countries that pay better ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/wages_and_labour_costs ) ( tl ; dr [ graph ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/6/64/median_gross_hourly_earnings%2c_all_employees_%28excluding_apprentices%29%2c_2010_%28%c2%b9%29_yb15.png ) ) . 
  well , the feeling is that the entire it field is extremely undervalued , in italy . 
  the matter is a bit complicated to explain in depth , i 'll try though : work contracts are regulated on a national level , depending on your field . 
  it professionals do n't have their own and , usually , they are hired using either the factory or retail workers contract . 
  this means that you end up with a contract designed for low skilled workers . 
  also , and most importantly , unions do n't feel the need to fight for your rights . 
  worker unions , in italy , hold a lot of power over working conditions . 
  another reason is that most of companies see it as an extra cost , not as a resource . 
  they ca n't see how - for instance - a properly managed network could , actually , * save * money . 
  in the netherlands i 'm earning three times what i used to get in italy , plus benefits . 
  this alone says a lot . 
  no , i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  and , quite honestly , you killed my will to provide a different angle on the matter after you felt the need to vilify me because i 'm italian . 
  i 've been living and working in the netherlands for the past two years . 
  anything else ? 
   but then again , when your whole culture is based on being `` furbo '' rather than smart , honest or hardworking , the result can not be any different . 
  yeah , sure . 
  we all play the mandolin and eat only bopity boopy . 
  sigh . 
  it was a mid level sysadmin job . 
  i burst into laugh when they told me the amount . 
  the worst was and offer i 've received a few months prior : 8 hours per 5 days , plus on call duty , as a sysadmin in a server farm with 200 physical servers and two clusters . 
  the working days were a bit weird , since the working week was supposed to be from wednesday to sunday . 
  i kid you not , they offered me 500 $ . 
  yes , you have to stay in italy . 
   this is quite good working salary level in romania or bulgaria i already had a one way ticket to the netherlands when i cashed in the first check , i left after three months of unemployment . 
  i had to leave my house and go back to my parents , no way you can afford living anywhere in italy with that kind of money . 
  unless you own the house you live in and have no mortgage , then it 's a different discussion . 
   honestly , do n't complain . 
  you have no right to tell me i should n't `` complain '' about my past situation , just because you think you 're going through harder times than i 've ever been in . 
  first , i was not complaining but i have just posted an example about the job market in the area i used to live in . 
  second , if you think i 've been living such a lucky and full life with a whopping 900 $ a month - which i was entitled to for no more than eight months - or even ** before ** finding myself without a job ... let 's put it like this , since you want to play the `` i 'm the miserable one '' game : come back after you 've spent an entire winter without heating because you ca n't afford the bills . 
  if you want to try the full `` me '' experience , reduce your meals to two per day - no other food than rice , milk and egg are allowed on a daily basis . 
  going out is out of the equation , of course , because there is n't enough money to put gasoline in your car 's tank for anything other than going to work . 
  obviously yes . 
  not in milan , nor * anywhere * . 
  story time , but it might give a little insight as to why it might be better to serve a coffee in the uk than working in it in italy . 
  when the company i used to work for in milan decided not to extend my contract ( april 2013 ) , i was eligible for for an unemployment compensation of $ 900 per month . 
  since i was going to move abroad three months later , i did n't really look for a job back there but my mom still wanted to show me a job offer she found . 
  the job was interesting and matched my skill , plus offered some good learning opportunities , so i went to the interview out of curiosity : they offered me 800 $ , less than i was getting from welfare . 
  and it was n't even the most ridiculous offer i 've received between 2010 and 2013 . 
   i just got back from tunisia and your questions were not `` what should i go see that a tourist might miss '' but `` dos and dont 's , particularly clothing '' . 
  that says a lot . 
   arab culture as it was pointed out to you in that same thread , [ do n't call it arab culture ] ( https://hu.reddit.com/r/tunisia/comments/36cvxb/hi_rtunisia_im_travelling_to_tunisia_for_a_week/crd2jwo ) . 
   i fear it 's more than just replacing the crosses by crescent moons . 
  these mean fundamental changes in our society , i 'm not sure i want to see . 
   i know you guys embrace the thought of islamic culture replacing dutch culture which is fine for me , it might turn out great and exciting , but please consider that other people might want their culture to prevail not to disappear . 
  your words , not mine . 
   you do n't really hesitate to put label on people you do n't even know , do you ? 
  you labeled me as a `` dutch who would love having his culture replaced by the islamic one '' , in case you forgot . 
   maybe you should be a little less prejudiced , that would do no wrong . 
  says the one who is labeling all the european muslim people as colonizing fundamentalists . 
  you clearly are scared and i feel genuinely sorry for you , as i can figure it really is horrible to live in fear of others , but this is a waste of time . 
  i hope that our spectators from / r/european had fun . 
  i honestly doubt there 's any chance to have a normal discussion with an islamophobe . 
  and no , i 'm not a muslim . 
  why else would we vote berlusconi as pm not once but three times ? 
  i 'm not dutch , although i do live in the neterlands . 
  you do n't wipe out and entire national heritage just by changing people 's beliefs - [ check out how many atheists are there around europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_atheism#/media/file:europe_no_belief_enhanced_2010.png ) . 
  did any national culture disappear because of atheism ? 
   you have to be open-minded and accept the opinion of other people . 
  so having a civil discussion on a topic makes me close minded and not accepting of other people 's opinion ? 
  edit : love it how the racist cavalry came to the rescue in this thread . 
  a religion replacing the other is a major event , of course society will change - * how * this will happen is really difficult to predict . 
  well it might as well happen that islam will become the religion with the most worshipers in europe , replacing christianity . 
  same as christianity replaced the roman polytheistic religion . 
  what 's your point ? 
  i 've lived in italy until early 2013 : ever since then , i 'm scared whenever i * do n't * feel and earthquake . 
  i 've never had the stomach to try brussu . 
  i feel like a phony ligurian ... :(, 
  yes , exactly that 's what the wikipedia article linked here says ... which makes sense , considering that calabria used to be greek . 
  most of the cities have names that come from ancient greek , the licence plate for crotone is even kr ( kroton ) . 
   it also explains why it sounds so foreign to me . 
  the dialect from my region ( liguria ) - which i understand but can not speak - has some loan words from latin and that 's about it . 
  it 's really difficult to answer this question : in the north , organized crime works mostly at a political and administrative level . 
  you know it 's there , something fishy can happen sometimes , but you do n't actually * see * it . 
  in naples , camorra is so flamboyantly present it shocked me : while my friend drove me from the airport to his house , i saw dozens of shoe stores with just a few boxes on display . 
  `` those are for money laundering '' my friend told me `` and everybody knows it '' . 
  another guy told me an entire neighborhood received phone calls , advising people `` it 's best if you do n't go out , tonight '' because there was a hit planned on someone . 
  another one told me she was discouraged * by the police * not to press charges against a group of teenagers who mugged her - said teenagers were waiting for her outside the police station , laughing . 
  i loved the city and loved the people , but having organized crime thrown in my face like that was something that really made me question what the state is doing against organized crime . 
  it 's doing * something * , but definitely not enough . 
  i 'm italian and even `` andrangheta '' sounds extremely foreign to me , mostly because ` ndrangheta is a calabrese dialect word while i 'm from far up north . 
  nope , although psychiatric wards in hospitals still exist . 
  not tomorrow but , if he is deemed clinically insane , he will be released in a matter of a few days/weeks . 
  italy has closed down all the psychiatric hospitals years ago ( as an effect of the controversial [ basaglia law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basaglia_law ) ) including the psychiatric prisons ( in 2015 ) . 
  he might still be charged with attempted murder , though . 
  italian newspapers did report the incident , but it 's been quickly dismissed as `` crazy hobo doing crazy hobo stuff '' . 
  which is most likely the case . 
  it still is a gold mine for tabloids . 
  i was pleasantly surprised to find no barilla anywhere in supermarkets , mostly a nice stock of de cecco and garofalo . 
  recently , albert heijn has been selling a voiello look ( and taste ) alike that i 'm buying from time to time .
