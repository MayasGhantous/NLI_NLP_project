  that 's no longer being a refugee , that 's being an illegal immigrant . 
  we have to do what is practical for our countries , not what gives you a good feeling . 
  and my biggest gripe with immigration , as a right wing person who sometimes says stupid things , is how the debate is ruled by emotion , and sensible criticism is waved away as being unaltruistic at best , and a nazi at worst . 
  it drives people to extremism , too . 
  if you treat someone as something long enough , they 'll start acting the part sooner or later . 
   because we are recovering from a financial crises ... that 's nonsense , these parties have existed for decades , as has the debate surrounding them . 
   top lel . 
  go back to stormfront please , you right wing nut jobs always sound the same `` omg the world is gon na blow up unless you do what i say ! '' . 
  oh , right , you 're one of those people . 
  where is yours ? 
  those numbers were posted maybe two weeks ago , and i had a look at them . 
  they are massively , insanely biased to produce those favourable results . 
  everything that was counted as `` right wing terrorism '' were basically regular crimes with known right wing perpetrators , even stooping so low as to inflate the numbers with perpetrators who were merely * suspected * of having right wing sympathies . 
  meanwhile , requirements for islamic terrorism were much more stringent . 
  if they same rules were applied to both , you 'd have to consider every crime committed by a muslim to be islamic terrorism . 
  honestly , you 're doing yourself a disservice by citing those numbers . 
  they are clear and obvious propaganda to anyone who has a brief look at them . 
  i mean , the claim alone is very suspicious , citing * hundreds * of terrorist attacks , because that is baghdad territory , right there . 
  and again , if the definition of islamic terrorism were similarly loose , the numbers would also be in the hundreds . 
  edit : no engagement of my arguments , or even posting the source of your numbers . 
  just a downvote . 
  do n't pretend you 're not one of the extremists , / u/thebeercannon . 
  if this is terrorism , then pretty much every left wing `` activist '' group is a terrorist organisation . 
  which does n't bode well for left wing parties , because nearly all of them recruit directly from these groups . 
  and the point is , people are doing this precisely because the reasonable , level-headed and democratic way continues to fail . 
  the concerns of people who oppose immigration have been ignored for decades , at this point . 
  and the politicians who make those arguments have been under literal attack . 
  the reasonable , level-headed and democratic way means giving up on normal life forever , while your attackers are all but vindicated by mainstream politics . 
  and i find it expecially jarring that the people on the left , who are normally very keen to explore societal circumstances that lead to criminality , are now dropping that line of thinking and boiling the entire situation down to an * ironically , very right wing ) viewpoint of personal responsibility . 
  oh yeah , the magical contact argument . 
  so let me ask , will you take their misgivings seriously if they still have them after the area becomes properly multicultural ? 
  we both know the answer to that one : you wo n't , and you 'll continue to use the exact same argument . 
  and we know , because that 's what mainstream western politics have been doing for decades , to the point where they routinely try to declare immigration-critical parties illegal . 
  and the fact is , these populations have been looking at western europe , and have seen this process . 
  they have seen the murders of people like van gogh and fortuyn . 
  they see the rethoric used against `` far right '' politicians . 
  and i imagine they do n't want similar politics in their own area . 
  this is by far one of the worst arguments against the extreme right , because it contains an implicit promise ( that it 's ok to be against immigration if you 've experienced it ) that we already know is false . 
  no , the extreme right gains power precisely because the wishes of its supporters continue to be ignored . 
  the majority of the eu , at this point , is against mass immigration . 
  and those wishes will either have to be considered by the elite , or these incidents will continue to happen . 
   the most `` refugee critical '' people live in regions with basically no immigration . 
  after our most recent elections , the government published a map detailing the percentages of people who voted for the different parties , per district . 
  the most votes for geert wilders were in his home district ( no big surprise ) , and in the most notorious `` multicultural '' city of the country . 
  the pvv managed to gather the most votes of all parties there , despite more than half the population being the target of his rethoric . 
  the idea that people magically grow tolerant once immigrants start living close to them is a complete myth . 
  rather , the population in culturally homogenous areas likely see the cultural friction immigration brings with it , and want nothing of the sort . 
  of course , dismissing their wishes entirely because what they do n't want to happen has n't happened yet might have something to do with . 
  and we all know what the argument will be when immigrants do move to their area 's , and they still do n't like them . 
  namely , exactly the same argument : they 're all racists , and this means they should have no democratic rights . 
  well , you 've already seen how good the french government is at protecting its people ... 
  ** trolljegeren ( norway ) ** what if all the troll myths were real ? 
  and there was a government employee to keep them in check ? 
  shot in documentary style , and both funny and exciting . 
  ** i love dries ( netherlands ) ** ok , so i 'm plugging a movie from my own country . 
  anyway , this is about folk singer dries roelvink ( played by himself ) who is kidnapped by `` his greatest fans '' , a corpulant rural couple living in a mobile home . 
  before they 're prepared to let him go , he must have sex with the woman so they can have a child . 
  fun fact : this movie is directed by human centipede mastermind tom six , and is pretty close to body horror in its own right . 
  ** lfo ( sweden/denmark ) ** a man discovers a special sound frequency that hypnotizes people and renders them extremely susceptible to suggestion , and decides to test it out on his new neighbours while also wrestling with unresolved guilt . 
  ** black lightning ( russia ) ** it 's basically the russian spiderman . 
  except instead of weird powers , a young college student acquires a flying lada , forgotten since soviet times . 
  ** la horde ( france ) ** a group of police officers mount an illegal raid on a nigerian gang boss ' lair in a semi-abandoned apartment building to bring him to justice for killing a compatriot . 
  it goes horribly wrong , but luckily ( ? ), 
  the zombie apocalypse breaks out right then and there , and nigerians and coppers alike must try to fight their way outside . 
  ** stalingrad ( germany ) ** well , i probably do n't need to tell you what this is about . 
  a dark tale of german soldiers as they desperately fight an outnumbered and outgunned battle that we already know wo n't have a happy ending for anyone except stalin . 
  ** technotise ( serbia ) ** it 's a serbian cyberpunk animated film . 
  what more do you need to know ? 
  ** l'illusionste ( france/scotland ) ** an illusionist tries to make a living plying his trade in a world where he is seen as an outdated laughing stock , while trying to take care of a young girl who seems to believe his magic is real . 
  an old-school 2d animated movie , based on a script from the 1950 's . 
  barely contains dialogue . 
  ** delicatessen ( france ) ** probably the most famous movie on my list , and you 've probably heard about it , but it 's great , so watch it if you have n't . 
  in a dreary post-apocalyptic world of failed harvests , a strange collection of tenants lives under the oppressive bootheel of the owner of their apartment building , who is also a butcher who has turned his craft to the occasional tenant who fails to pay their bill . 
  a new tenant arrives , a clown who also falls for the butcher 's daughter . 
  can he evade the angry father 's sharp blade ? 
  the expression that it 's sad , without explanation , does seem like a dismissal . 
  at least , it does to me . 
  maybe the right is a bit hypersensitive about this , because we 're just coming from an era - or might even still be in an era - where dismissing right wing opinions outright is seen as the natural way of things . 
  simply put , the left wing is the status quo opinion , while the right wing has had to fight for recognition . 
  so a seeming lack of recognition is taken very seriously . 
  well , that 's my explanation , at least . 
  that 's still you completely glossing over the motivation and thought that might go behind these votes . 
  it 's a complete dismissal of other people 's opinions . 
  and then you whine about your own opinion being dismissed . 
  you ca n't have your cake , and eat it , too . 
  you 're being downvoted for stating your opinion as if it is fact . 
  i mean , it 's sad that people do n't vote on the same party as you ? 
  welcome to democracy . 
  we saw this argument in the netherlands , too . 
  the left wing parties forgot , for convenience , that they had harboured terrorists themselves . 
  hell , the green party recruits directly from greenpeace . 
  when greenpeace `` activists '' got caught in russia , our government used the last favours it had left with russia to get them back . 
  you ca n't count on that sort of help if you 're caught smuggling drugs or something . 
  so , as always , there is a double standard here . 
  i 'm not sure if it applied to sweden , but i 'd bet my left nut that it does . 
  the crux of the matter is that there are no requirements to become a politician . 
  so yes , it does attract some seedy people , or simply people not fit for the job . 
  hell , our current minister of defense is a fucking secretary . 
  we 've had people who held double posts in foreign countries because of their second passport . 
  this is a problem that 's inherent to the nature of politics .
