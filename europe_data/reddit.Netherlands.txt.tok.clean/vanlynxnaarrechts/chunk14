  he 's still the fucking pope . 
  it 's all a sham . 
  behind the supposedly tolerant , hip , obama-like exterior is still a religious dictator who thinks wearing a condom is a sin . 
  honestly , it 's ridiculous to see the same people who complained about the child sexual abuse in the church suddenly turn around and give the pope the thumbs up . 
  the entire system that made it possible did n't magically cease to exist when the church made the very conscious decision to elect someone with a youthful image as pope . 
  pope benedict xvi was the first pope to resign ** since 1415 ** . 
  that is not a decision they made lightly , and certainly not solely because of his health . 
  in fact , the man is still very much alive . 
  no , i suspect the many , many photoshops of him as emperor palpatine and the like may have had something to do with it . 
  and the sudden reversal the world has shown the church with this simple change of face seems to support that . 
  this once more affirms that immigration is a political issue . 
  and if it is a political issue , ** we have the right to vote on it ** . 
  but this right has been constantly denied us , and at every turn the established powers try to make it impossible to vote against mass immigration . 
  sometimes to the point of assassination . 
  i am young , i must live in this country for years to come . 
  this is my future they are talking about . 
  but no , i am stupid . 
  i am racist . 
  my opinion is bypassed entirely . 
  but they should not think we can not undo their undemocratic policy . 
  they exiled ayaan hirsi ali after more than a decade because she was n't being a good , tame , little immigrant . 
  we can do the same with the immigrants they do approve of . 
   a doctor that simply lets its patient rot away while telling them they 're fine is an incompetent docto this is a dutch saying . 
  `` soft healers make for stinking wounds '' . 
  this is happening in europe right now . 
  no-one willing to be hard , all wanting to be perceived as caring , trusting , and humane . 
  just like `` mutti merkel '' . 
  they complain about right wing populism , but they are the greatest populists : taking on problems for which they have no solution , and shoving it all ahead for those who come after them to take care of it . 
  we have no real leadership in western europe . 
  just a few powerful regents looking out for themselves . 
  but they are winning . 
  reinforcements flow across the border daily . 
  do n't worry . 
  timmermans is a typical establishment politician with weak knees , and he has already retracted the statement . 
  just in case we needed any more proof that antifa and other left wing extremists are modern brownshirts . 
  it is . 
  in the netherlands , we have the same law . 
  but , of course , here we do not treat natives and migrants equally . 
  that would be fair and stuff ... 
  ah , the guardian . 
  always trying to prove that they can be just as stupid as the daily mail . 
  is this blatant racism somehow supposed to speak in your favour ? 
   the idea behind it is that every citizen should be treated equally . 
  then dual citizenship should be banned by default . 
  or can i pick up an extra passport somewhere ? 
  that is what decades of ideologically motivated mismanagement by desk jockeys without practical experience will do to an army . 
  it happened to ours as well . 
  sometimes i wonder if it should be possible for politicians to be held accountable for their shocking , populist incompetence . 
  especially with the current crisis . 
  [ stalin kicked the bucket .

  you 're not wrong . 
  when i first went to africa when i was young , i was surprised that they had cities and stuff . 
  of course , i was a young child , and my knowledge of africa consisted of tearjerker commercials on tv , and fundraisers at school . 
  this despite my mother being from africa . 
  i still see people on reddit or other places who are convinced africa is `` an unlivable hellhole '' because of all the propaganda they swallowed . 
  the sort of people who will call you a racist when you point out it 's the most fertile continent on earth . 
  the problem is , not everyone is approaching it logically , least of all the people with a fairly limited window into western life . 
  when i was young , and i watched movies like american pie , i thought american high school was supposed to be like that . 
  i felt incredibly self-conscious about not partying and having sex at 16 . 
  but eventually i learned it 's all bullshit because i got on with life . 
  it works the same for people in the third world , who only see the west through tv and through what they hear from other people who also do n't know , or intentionally misrepresent . 
  i believe there was even a small business that photoshopped pictures of immigrants in order to make it look to everyone back home that they had become rich . 
  the smugglers spin crazy tales about how we 're all waiting for them to come work here , and how the money is up for grabs , here . 
  it reminds me of an ancient joke about immigrants : a family of immigrants comes to the netherlands , and when they get off the boat the son of the family spots a quarter on the ground . 
  `` it 's true , dad !, 
  the money is really lying on the streets here ! '', 
  ( this is a dutch expression ) . 
  `` now now , '' the dad cautions his son , `` do n't get over-exited . 
  we only start working tomorrow ! '', 
  my mother is from africa , and she goes there often . 
  one thing she told me that always stuck with me is that people there also watch soaps like the bold & the beautiful , but that they think - like me at 16 - it is supposed to represent average life in the west . 
  one of her friends even believed that white people do not do blue-collar work , here , and that it 's all done by non-white immigrants . 
  and this was a smart , kind man . 
  there 's no telling what the stupid , cruel ones believe , or want to believe . 
  or rather , there is . 
  and you saw the result of that in cologne . 
  the same was true for the cda in the netherlands . 
  a fact left wing parties use to say `` the netherlands never had a left wing government '' despite their idealism dominating politics since the 70 's . 
  and despite the cda being superficially very powerful , the left influenced the media almost exclusively . 
  and that 's why equating `` politics '' to `` one powerful party '' is stupid . 
  butcher harris deserved to be put on trail . 
  he used the military of britain to further a personal grudge against the german people . 
  and whoever was responsible for the englandspiel deserved to stand trail , too . 
  butcher harris is responsible for many german civilian deaths , but both are also responsible for many allied lives sacrificed in service to their selfish ideals . 
  personally i think nimitz was a good commander . 
  but macarthur was a raving madman who left my people to die in jap pow camps , again , for personal idealism . 
  and not even that , oh no , he even started smearing nimitiz during the war in order to further his own post-war political career . 
  macarthur can get fucked . 
  the lunatic was set to plunge us into nuclear war , too . 
  i 've found people on reddit who claim that the holodomor and the cheka are `` capitalist propaganda '' . 
  plenty of communist apologists exist , make no mistake . 
  and many more who fall into the `` soft '' camp of disapproving of the acts , but reasoning there were mitigating circumstances . 
  it 's presented as `` two sexual assaults '' , which is a legal definition . 
  hence my apprehension . 
  classifying it as a single incident would be correct . 
  at least , in so far as it 's a single event , because these events are not incidental . 
  i said `` politics '' , not `` the cdu '' , or even `` the ruling party '' . 
  i think you 'll find that german politics consist of more than just the cdu . 
  he 's not the first paperpusher they 're charging in recent years .
