  the socialist party in this country used to oppose immigration , because `` they take our jerbs '' . 
  and that 's the problem . 
  you have no real basis to call them far right . 
  at least , not one you apply fairly across the board . 
  and it gets worse when `` does not fit in with the established political spectrum '' far right gets lumped in with the `` want to shove the jews into the ovens '' far right , which is exactly what almost everyone who is following the far right narrative is doing . 
  maybe you 're being downvoted because you call everyone who disagrees with you a racist . 
  syria is maybe close in physical terms , but in cultural terms it might as well be on the other side of the world . 
  pegida has recently also become international . 
  anyway , the point is , you compare pegida to the political spectrum of the country where they are based , and conclude they are far to the right of the spectrum . 
  i do the same with greenpeace , and conclude they are far to the left . 
  if opposing standing political policy in a democratic nation is enough to be labelled `` far right '' , it should be the same to be labelled `` far left '' . 
  my point since the beginning is that people are quick to label things `` far right '' , but do n't apply the same rigour to things that could just as easily be labelled `` far left '' . 
  greenpeace is n't . 
  they sail under the dutch flag , as i have already pointed out . 
  i am not german . 
  are you seriously suggesting that the governments who tried to answer that first question have n't been utter assholes to their fellow human beings ? 
  which government ? 
  mine did not . 
  in fact , mine was part of the coalition , and that includes the support of left wing parties . 
  given that greenpeace sails under our flag , and that they perpetrated illegal activism against american warships in our harbours , i 'd say they are very much to the far left of the spectrum , according to the same logic you use to place pegida to the far right . 
   for asking more of her country than most politicians would dare , for standing firm against tyranny this statement seems to contradict itself . 
  then i would say that greenpeace 's objection to the second gulf war puts them to the far left . 
  what views of pegida are far right ? 
  as far as i know , they simply oppose the standing immigration policy . 
  a wrong choice of words , perhaps . 
  what i mean is that they are very similar in their activism . 
  yes , greenpeace is accepted , but that does not legitimize their actions . 
  it merely means many people agree with them , but not with pegida . 
  to throw out a godwin , every young child in nazi germany was in the hitler jugend , but no-one would consider the nazi 's moderate . 
  when you strip away the commercials , boats , offices , whatever , both are groups that try to influence political policy by being agent provocateurs . 
  pegida has criticism on standing government policy , and so has greenpeace . 
  both are at the margins of society . 
  i do n't see the difference . 
  yeah , but neither is antisemitism integral to right wing politics , yet right wing politics get saddled with the stigma of nazism . 
  and maybe our mileage varies , but i 'm seeing equally stupid policies on the left , including the dismantling of rights they helped build . 
  in france , the right is staunchly against gay marriage , but in the netherlands lgbt rights have largely been internalised by the right , while the left is actively looking away when lgbt discrimination occurs . 
   more often than not , i find that the people who claim that they 're being `` persecuted '' for being right-wing are actually extreme right-wing who believe that they 're the mainstream right wing . 
  i think this is partly a selffulfilling policy . 
  if someone is forced into a role often enough , they will take to it . 
  we had pim fortuyn , who was shot for being `` far right '' , but reviewing his opinions today reveals them as being very moderate compared to modern politics , and his `` disgusting , racist language '' to be very reasonable . 
  there 's even a video of him cautioning for an upcoming economic crisis . 
  was n't me . 
  and you 're still missing the point . 
  yeah , they are fairly moderate . 
  so is , say , pegida , who as far as i know only have a march now and then . 
  yet pegida is considered far right , while greenpeace is n't considered far left . 
  that is the discrepancy i 'm trying to point out . 
  you 're right . 
  i 'm not arguing for harsher policy , i 'm trying to provide insight into what the people who favour it think . 
  people like to put this discussion in terms of entitlement , left or right . 
  the right says the unemployed feel entitled to free money , the left says the employed feel entitled to cheap/free labour . 
  either way , dismissing the other side as unthinking assholes is counterproductive . 
  oh , this i can answer . 
  i was giving a short , stupid answer to what i considered a short , stupid response . 
  i do n't * really * think the extremists on the left are literally all racists , fascists , and nazi 's , though i do believe them to be so close as to make little difference . 
  especially considering that specifically these accusations are basically just buzzwords for `` politics i do n't like '' , these days . 
  believe me , plenty right wing people claim that the left are `` the new nazi 's '' . 
  i also believe that whatever their label , the extremists are ultimately very similar . 
  i used to have far left people among my friends , and some of the things they said might well have come out of the mouths of nazi 's . 
  particularly the things regarding jews . 
  hell , one of them used to wear combat boots with red laces . 
  he said it stood for socialism . 
  we had to inform him that in right wing extremist circles , it meant you had kicked a black person to death . 
  i suppose it would be more accurate to say the far left has racists , anarchists , and communists . 
  but when i say that , i feel like i 'm from the 1950 's . 
  short and stupid the initial posts might have been , the resulting discussion was interesting . 
  if the narrative were similar , that is , if we linked left wing politics more to the despicable acts of communism , perhaps we would see much more of these articles about the left wing . 
  if you do n't think greenpeace actually commits illegal activities , you 're the one living in another world . 
  their political allies had to talk them out of russian prison when they boarded a russian drilling rig . 
  and my point is that everyone up in arms about the far right would consider greenpeace far left if they applied the same rules to their own idealism . 
  if you are of the opinion that only `` the other side '' has extremists , you 're very probably one of the extremists on your side . 
  well , what we can do about it is a whole other discussion . 
  but the ransoms do go directly to funding terrorism , so it 's more than just an economical question . 
   a right wing equivalent ** would be considered ** `` far right '' . 
  emphasis on ** would be ** . 
  my argument is that the opinion that something is `` far right '' is informed by people 's own political preferences , rather than some sort of hard definition . 
  the political parties that are named `` far right '' piece for piece are less criminal and extremist in their actions than greenpeace , * which major left wing parties actively recruit members from * . 
  what i am saying is that if the same definitions for labelling something `` far right '' were used to apply the label `` far left '' , a lot of mainstream politics would be considered `` far right '' . 
  it all comes back to my original post : people who vote right wing constantly have to defend themselves from accusations of being fascists , and are constantly asked to justify their voting behaviour . 
  we live in free , democratic countries . 
  they do n't need to justify their democratic right , and anyone who insists on doing so is being the political extremist , and a big hypocrite on top of that . 
   they did not specified the value of the ransom paid to the pirates , but kidnapping is rampant in nigeria with hostages generally released unharmed if ransoms are paid . 
  this is from the article . 
  they were not freed by military action , so occam 's razor points to ransom . 
  this is exactly the problem i am referring to in my original post . 
  why do you not ask the same of / u/tartanyco ? 
  so is the far left . 
  i think it comes down to trust . 
  while they might agree with the stated policy , they have no faith that the party will enforce that policy and that the party will rather go for the policy they do n't agree with . 
  i had a similar feeling with the pirate party . 
  i considered them as a serious choice , as i think it 's important to have a party that is n't retarded on it in parlement , but then i saw that they were in favour of boycotting goods from israel . 
  i had no intention of voting in policy i do not agree with under the veil of policy that is presented as a-political . 
  so i had many good reasons to vote for them , but one very glaring one to not do so . 
  sure , but you can also try to dodge the work requirement . 
  but this is kantian philosophy , i believe : you always have a choice , even if it 's a shitty one . 
  but we 're just discussing semantics . 
  at the end of the day , politics always comes down to the compromise . 
  or it should , anyway . 
  seems like a sound definition . 
  though i 'd probably look at the motivations .
