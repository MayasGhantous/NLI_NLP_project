  the bottom line is : though you might have nothing to hide if you 're doing nothing wrong , you 're not the one who decides whether you 're doing nothing wrong . 
  that actually sounds like a pretty good flash mob , 
  she is also ( or actually : especially , because that 's what she was in the show for ) a privacy advocate , and was annoyed at gordon for not letting her discuss actual privacy issues due to his constantly interrupting her for saying she had no right to ( discuss ) privacy due to her being a nude model . 
  very much true , my main point was that the headline paints an overly pessimistic picture . 
  a debt of $ 30.000 on a yearly income of $ 50.000 is very much different to 250 % of available income , 
  yes , but the value of real estate is , i presume , not incorporated in the clickbait figures mentioned in the headline . 
  because even if the houses are worth less than what was paid for it using loans , that still means you can pay off a good portion of your debt by selling the house , making the debt a lot smaller . 
  that is appalling ... 
  of course , but how do i know whether there is more truthfulness in this statement than in one that says the exact opposite ? 
  i am amazed by your high-quality sources . 
  no but seriously , how should i know beggars ( all of them ? ), 
  at the eiffel tower make hundreds of euro 's a day ? 
  and if they did not , what else would they be able to do ? 
  ** edit : ** thanks for the anecdotes and sources guys !, 
  thanks !, 
  i see , that 's a lot more comforting  although procedurally sound does not mean those laws should exist in the first place , let 's hope that the discussion resulting from this incident will lead to them being updated . 
  1 ) that he had no access to a lawyer was what i considered one of the more scandalous points , so if that 's not true , i 'd very much like to see a reliable source for it . 
  2 ) they stopped him for questions * using an anti-terrorism law * , while he was doing journalistic work . 
  so no , there was no good reason for stopping him for questioning , since there is no reason to make him a suspect of terrorism . 
  3 ) the term * british law * is also confusing , as the law used was only valid on airports and ports . 
  as far as i understand it , this is used as an argument for that law to be far more dubious than those applicable in the * actual * uk . 
  please note that i 'm not trying to be ignorant , so if you 're annoyed or something by incorrect facts , then please correct me , as i 'd very much like to know what is actually true -- especially if it 's not as scandalous as i 'm currently fearing it to be . 
  got a source for that ? 
  because i can really recall multiple what i considered reliable sources mentioning the absence of a lawyer ...

  they did not know what he was carrying and did not take anything out of the country - his passage through heathrow was merely a layover . 
  in any case , that is not what is relevant . 
  what is relevant is that an anti- ** terrorism ** law , that is already dubious by itself , was used to detain someone trying to do journalistic work and is among the loved ones of a journalist , ** without access to a lawyer ** yet with the ** prospect of being arrested when not cooperating ** . 
  they at least tried to destroy hard drives with the data , and ( whether intentionally or not ) intimidated someone helping a journalist by holding him hostage for 9 hours without a lawyer , and confiscating his belongings . 
  ... but the fact that they 're trying to prevent them from reporting about it should cause due concern . 
  that actually sounds pretty good !, 
  ( also , i hate ai se eu te pego , so thanks for sharing :p ), 
  though not my thing , i know a lot of my friends very much appreciate the cat empire ( although they 're not really an rnb/hip hop group )  hilltop hoods sounds pretty laidback indeed . 
  i actually love the rubberbandits . 
  horse outside is great , though i like black man more , and the greyhound shuffle is great too . 
  exactly the type of music i was looking of , their being irish plays a great part in what makes it great , 
  and i guess i 'll start . 
  in ** the netherlands ** , we have [ de jeugd van tegenwoordig ] ( http://grooveshark.com/#!/dejeugdvantegenwoordig ) ( `` youth nowadays '' ) , an r&b / hip hop group from the netherlands that is mostly special for their electronic beats and humorous mostly slang dutch lyrics containing many neologisms inspired by other languages . 
  they started out looking to be a one hit wonder , but are now an established group that is sure to get the dance floor moving . 
  but you start signalling the moment you intend to change lanes , while in the netherlands we start when actually start changing lanes . 
  that can be really scary . 
  ^ or ^ so ^ i 've ^ heard , ^ i ^ do n't ^ have ^ my ^ driver 's ^ license . 
  ^ your ^ way ^ even ^ sounds ^ more ^ logical . 
  they 'll just pretend to be e-cars and then secretly run on diesel :p, 
  that sounds reasonable , but that does n't explain why it happens so often that the same people call one group adhering to that definition `` terrorists '' , and another group , say , `` freedom fighters '' . 
  but then we could start and label every crime as a terrorist act . 
  that said , the term `` terrorism '' is vague enough that they might not even be too far off from the way some people use it . 
  `` we thought you deserved a present too , santa ! '', 
  i also like the one about [ jan sloot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_sloot ) , who supposedly made a compression algorithm that is impossible , but died of a heart attack a day before signing an attractive deal , taking all the details of the algorithm to the grave . 
  conspiracy theories abound . 
  for real . 
  we were forced to watch [ this guy ] ( http://www.freewebs.com/ikmikloreland/karbonkel.png ) at primary school . 
  compared to the total of dutch territory , which was referred to , 
   some places like argentina and uruguay are more european than the west european countries themselves that 's not even possible _ by definition _ 0 . o, 
  oil no , gas yes , but since extracting that has been damaging houses , they 're starting to cut back on that . 
  apart from the already mentioned increase in refugees , the eu also took over the rescue operations from italy , and is far less thorough - operating fewer kilometres from italy 's shore and , iirc , with less material . 
  i do n't have hard numbers on whether and which extra fatalities this did not prevent , but it stands to reason that it costs more lives . 
  at least the problem of e.g. 
  polio re-appearing , which can be considered worse and affects more people . 
  one does n't exclude the other . 
  that 's some ugly ass-bike :p, 
  haha , great . 
  [ but surely those are just stories of the past , and we 're fully cooperating nowadays ? 
   it 's actually not a bad newspaper compared to tabloids . 
  used toilet paper is not a bad newspaper compared to tabloids :p, 
  ah , definitely . 
  the other way around as well : people live with people they want to live with . 
  which makes sense , 
  ha , cause and effect might be disputed indeed . 
  then again , my anecdotal evidence says the main factor in choosing a place to live is whether you were from that area originally ( especially in the countryside of the netherlands , which is what i 'm talking about ) , rather than the amount of immigrants they have , 
  my point was that of all the people that support the foreigner-wary parties , many ( but ** not all ** ) of them live in the least multicultural places . 
  yes , a lot of them also live in rotterdam , but as they are still in the minority , that does n't invalidate the point . 
  rotterdam is part of the `` not often '' , 
  i think the percentage of non-natives in limburg is quite a bit lower than in the randstad . 
  then again , i did n't bother to check sources :p, 
  `` isolate '' or `` because they get a better deal negotiating with those alliances than they would when negotiating with the extremist one '' ? 
  in the netherlands , places with the fewest immigrants often have a larger share of votes for parties that `` fear '' them . 
  i wonder how many their losses are in absolute numbers . 
  which is funny because `` worst '' is dutch for `` sausage '' . 
   the cashier gets upset if you 're the one who showed id but your buddy is the one using his credit card to buy the beer . 
  in the netherlands , everyone has to show id regardless of who 's paying . 
  i am sort-of worried that google `` personalises '' the results to startpage ... 
  what the hell , how come i 've never seen this ? 
  it 's not about proof , it 's about laws not applying , because not all countries agree on what proper laws are . 
  if we can , say , jail diplomats for killing someone , then other countries can jail our diplomats for , say , being gay . 
  just because there 's proof does n't mean that we 'd be ok with our diplomats being penalised . 
  implying : crossing a border is a worse offence than emptying lakes . 
  because it 's great , it should be considered european ? 
  regardless of the appropriateness of these actions , some context might be interesting for the non-dutchies . 
  there have been a lot of demonstrations against setting up refugee centres around the netherlands recently . 
  several of those turned violent , and several local politicians have received death threats , had property damaged , and/or were intimidated in another way . 
  in fact , that has been the majority of refugee-related problems in the netherlands hitherto . 
  so regardless of whether this is the right course of action , the motives likely were n't to silence people , but to prevent such incidents . 
  it was meant tongue-in-cheek , 
  it 's easier when you know russian as well , but i do n't and got by fine using english ( target young folks though ) . 
  i 'm bilingual , but somehow almost nobody there understands dutch . 
  ouch . 
  people kill people for being the wrong kind of people . 
  that sounds a lot better .
