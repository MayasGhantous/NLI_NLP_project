  ha , i remember that one from my history book as well . 
  it 's very annoying that we ca n't reliably assess statements such as these , and that they 're hard to trust considering how loosely terror agencies define `` attacks '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure those fifty attacks are n't attacks like those that happened yesterday , but then what are they ? 
   we have to do something . 
  no , we only have to do something if that something works . 
  the problem is that a lot of the actions are merely theatre because everybody feels we have to do `` something '' , not matter what it is , as long as it sounds strong ( e.g. 
  `` war '' ) . 
  truth is , we ca n't protect our liberties from every malicious person 100 % without giving up those same liberties . 
  we can , however , try to prevent people from turning malicious . 
  i shudder to think how many potential future terrorists are potentially raised by locking children up in war-torn countries . 
  exactly . 
  terrorists should only make middle eastern people suffer , in the middle east , not us , so let 's send all of them back there . 
  ( sarcasm of course . ), 
  exactly . 
  i sat down behind my computer yesterday , all riled up to blame some ethnic swedes for whatever would happen , and then this guy came up saying they were middle eastern . 
  ah , good , then at least we can still blame middle eastern people . 
  your post above does n't link to a report ... 
  still , it 's good to realise the distinction between them , as i 'm sure many people reading the original comment would have interpreted it without it . 
  _ or _ the us makes the us a safe haven for personal data . 
  ** edit : ** actually , more likely , the large companies make the same agreements with the data protection agencies of individual countries . 
  username checks out . 
  was the zebra born in captivity , or was it caught and only then domesticated ? 
  because i recall ( it 's been a while ) that diamond argued that the former was n't possible . 
  in any case it did n't happen on a large scale  ( also , that he argues it 's `` pure luck '' is n't an argument against it - just because it sounds unpleasant , that does n't mean it 's not true :p ) but still , the main reason i mentioned it is because the book also describes a lot of other theories . 
  just planting one with a short quip on reddit unfairly highlights one while it 's not the most likely theory . 
  wow , i really hope that was intentional - it makes so much sense that you do n't even notice it . 
  oh man , you think you 're just hopping into a random reddit thread , and you get out with a reading list for the next few years :p, 
  i do n't quite see how , but in any case that 's not why i mentioned it . 
  see [ my other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nbbsp/eurotunnel_services_for_passengers_and_freight/cvmo3dk ) for why i mentioned it . 
  same to you !, 
  thanks , that sounds interesting ( and more nuanced than a reddit quip ) - i 've added it to my reading list . 
  it 's not just about his view ; he also treats a lot of other viewpoints . 
  i think the main takeaway is that op 's intuition is only one of many theories ( and not a too credible one at that ) which mostly fits in well with a narrative that allows you to blame others outside your in-group - which does n't make it true ( or untrue ) , but should make you weary of your intuitions . 
  you do make very sweeping statements that you ca n't properly prove or disprove in the comment section of reddit , so there 's not much else you can do other than that . 
  for a good , thorough overview of possible explanations , see if you can get a hold of the book ** guns , germs and steel ** . 
  very interesting book anyway . 
  is n't that the capital of amsterdam ? 
  not even of learning how to drive - it 's just part of your upbringing . 
  even if you 're not in the driver 's seat you watch before opening the door . 
   the guys at the driving school should have drilled that into your soul . 
  i do n't have a driver 's license , but even still it 's just a habit to look before you open . 
  then again , it 's pretty easy to get used to when the risk of someone cycling past is actually high . 
  when fewer people cycle , i can imagine this being harder to get ingrained into your system . 
  fair point , shame . 
  are there any services that erdogan himself uses that these files could be uploaded to ? 
   it 's all self serving megalomania that increases with unnerving frequency . 
  i wonder whether this is actually the case or only seems that way because people relatively often bring it up in your circles/reddit . 
  i certainly never get this impression other than from people going on about it on reddit . 
  i 've read all the comments below yours , but it seems nobody 's answering this : what happens if she does n't do anything related to this post ? 
  people just say `` she ca n't '' , but why not ? 
  will she have to pay a fine ? 
  will she be jailed ? 
  https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/middle-ground , 
  if so , that only strengthens my point - but even if not , fighting the minimum tax is not in our interest . 
   ( alone ) in the article :  one of several faulting international companies, 
  no need to turn this into a national blame game . 
  except that we 're stimulating a system in which all countries compete to provide the lowest taxes , resulting in less taxes paid overall . 
  it 's not unlikely that , if there 's a eu-wide minimum , several corporations will leave but the ones that do n't ( because there 's not really a better place to move to ) will have to pay more . 
  furthermore , the taxpayer is also disadvantaged by this system because it stifles innovation - new and innovative players are at a disadvantage relative to established companies that are able to profit from the tax breaks . 
  did i hear that right ? 
  did someone say elfstedentocht ? 
  it 's such a privilege to live here and be able to look at so many of their paintings so easily . 
   that must be vanishingly small proportion of people yes , relative to the entire population , that is a small percentage . 
  there 's no reason to consider this relative to the entire population , however : the point is that this will give a significant amount of people access that can use it , and that these people will be able to use them to significant benefit to society . 
   surely it would be easier to make some funds available so that retired academics ( et al. ), 
  can get access to articles that they will make use of what makes you say so ? 
  how is simply removing restrictions more difficult than applying some restrictions in some edge cases ? 
  the latter seems to me to be far more cumbersome and costly , _ and _ relies on us being able to determine accurately , in advance , exactly who might be able to use access , and to be able to accurately target them . 
  and for what ? 
   fair hearing to some of problems associated with complete oa this is important , but it 's also important to discern problems inherent to oa to problems associated with oa because of its current implementation . 
  for example , there 's no inherent reason why peer review has to be worse for oa than for paywall articles . 
  as for who pays : the same one as who pays for the articles currently , namely science funders . 
  ah sorry , i misunderstood what was meant by `` hosting rights '' , i think . 
  i think the eu can pay for the publishing of articles , but the rights to the article are theirs ( or : the author 's / their institution 's ) and not whatever publisher 's . 
  haha , does `` belastung '' mean something like `` touching '' ? 
  that 's the only way i ( with a little knowledge of german ) can imagine it being that . 
  why would we pay for the research if we ca n't use it afterwards ? 
  spreading the results is imho an essential part of doing the research . 
  that would be nice . 
  i think the latter is what they 're going for , and there is a definitive movement towards full open access . 
  the publication costs do n't have to change for open access * , so it should n't have to cost more : the costs are now simply borne at publication time rather than at access time . 
  these costs are still going to be covered by the same organisations that cover them now . 
  \\* in practice , they do , but these costs mostly lie in the publishers now needing to maintain systems in which they only selectively allow access to some of their articles only when required by the funders/authors of those articles . 
  you 're underestimating `` the general public '' . 
  this can include retired academics , academics that now work in e.g. 
  journalism , academics that do not work for universities , academics in the developing world , and academics that work for institutions that simply have not paid for access to that particular journal that they need access to . 
  the difference is that members of parliament that are not in the government ( i.e. 
  at least the opposition , and hopefully also the pvda and vvd-mps ) are still allowed to call it that . 
  well , i mean , there is _ some _ pvda policy in the government 's policies ... 
  i also saw several articles on the companies claiming they would move away if government revised the tax system . 
  these articles kept claiming that that would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs - i wonder what that was based off . 
  it ca n't really be the brievenbusfirma 's , right ? 
  i do wonder whether that 's pvda policy , or whether it 's something they traded for something else . 
  if so , that `` something else '' better be something good . 
  just the current government , right ? 
  now i 'm curious as to what connotation that is . 
  you could compare the profits the daughter company is making to those their competitors are , and then consider the difference to be a relatively reasonable estimation of the value of the brand . 
  make a conservative estimate and you will probably not disadvantage the company , but still end up with a number far low than `` exactly the amount of profit you made '' . 
  too late now , mind is made up . 
  good for you .
