  they are just there as an option for those who want it . 
  i 'm impressed by italy and spain 's performance ; they are doing better than all the richer eu countries . 
  what is their secret ? 
  does a mediterranean diet help here or is it really healthcare itself ? 
  i imagine there are n't many old people in syria , so that probably makes it easier, 
  one can only account for risks that are reasonably predictable . 
  in cases of arbitration it often seems to be things like the government closing power plants that were previously allowed and the government nationalizing industries , destroying the market in those industries . 
  in cases of , say , earthquakes or floods , you can predict the risk and therefore insure against it . 
  however , the whims of the electorate are unpredictable so some other form of protection is needed . 
  if a country has such a risk without a way to get compensation , it would be unwise to invest in such countries . 
  yes , definitely agree with that one . 
  it only work if all companies have equal access . 
  the gap between spain/greece and the rest is massive . 
  is this real or do they have substantially larger underground economies ? 
  this article seems to make two points : * companies should not be able to sue the government * the tribunals should not be secret i agree with their second point as transparency is needed to hold the government accountable . 
  it is absurd for the government to have to pay money when tax payers can not find out what it is for . 
  however , i do not agree with the first point . 
  to create an environment where companies are willing to invest in a country , it is essential that the government does not arbitrarily change policies , harming businesses in the process . 
  this is equivalent to expropriation , which requires a fair compensation . 
  that compensation should include future profits in some cases as money is invested not just to get it back , but because a certain return on investment can be reasonably expected . 
  if companies are guaranteed fair and independently assessed compensation in such cases , it makes investment more attractive which in the end benefits everyone . 
   pro-bushiness false , we definitely prefer for our women to shave, 
  as much as i like to bash belgium , this statement is very misleading . 
  although belgium holds the record for the longest government formation , they were not at any point in time during that formation without a functioning government . 
  the previous government acted as a caretaker government in this period , with the authority to do everything necessary to govern the country . 
  how is malawi `` definitely a failed state '' ? 
  it 's about average for africa ( [ source ] ( http://fsi.fundforpeace.org/map/2015heatmap.png ) ) , not nearly as bad as actual failed states like somalia , ( south ) sudan and the car . 
  bike is missing . 
  has it been stolen ? 
  bashing belgium is our national pastime ( in the netherlands ), 
  just imagine if he had seen the internet . 
   is lending another 90bn for something bound to fail self-preservation ? 
  it is n't ( and should never have happened ) but that is not what is framed as a punishment . 
  not lending even more is what framed as a punishment . 
   if suddenly the greek state found a way to get tax evasion to zero , it would be left with a huge ammount of people owing to the state because you just ca n't squeeze blood out of a stone . 
  this is n't a reason not to fight tax evasion though . 
  the system is less - not more - fair when some people are paying a lot and others are evading . 
  a solution is never sudden . 
  once the government is succeeding in broadening the tax base , it could lower the tax rates proportionally . 
   i would say first to find ways to reverse that culture of tax evading and then adjust the taxes . 
  cultures are very hard to change , especially because the incentive remains as long as enforcement is lax . 
  enforcement has to be the first step . 
  in any case , the government can not survive without sufficient revenue so they have no choice but to either broadening the tax base or the tax rates . 
  between the two , broadening the tax base is obviously the better choice . 
   they want blood and punishment for `` the lazy greeks '' . 
  this is not what most are saying . 
  refusing to pay for other people 's debts is not punishment , it is self-preservation . 
  tax evasion is not caused by high taxes , it 's caused by lax enforcement . 
  if other countries manage to get tax evasion under control i do n't see why it would not be possible in greece . 
   opera is a medium bound to die how so ? 
   maybe it served a purpose on its time but entertainment has evolved and there is very little space ( if any ) for opera . 
  why not ? 
  even though it 's a small percertage of the population , many people sincerely enjoy operas much more than hollywood movies . 
   i do n't think this is the right metric to measure a country 's art appreciation . 
  i was n't claiming to do so though . 
  hmmm ... in that case my source is incomplete :(, 
  sorry about that . 
  here is a more color-blind friendly version : http://i.imgur.com/qpxhzkr.png, 
  according to operabase it 's just 5 : * http://operabase.com/plan.cgi?lang=en&amp;season=2014/15&amp;ci=ie * http://operabase.com/plan.cgi?lang=en&amp;season=2015/16&amp;ci=ie note : `` the elixir of love '' is on the list but is not counted because it was in 2014 . 
  i made a more color-blind friendly version : http://i.imgur.com/qpxhzkr.png, 
  the numbers are per million population, 
  oops , sorry about that . 
  fiwi the following countries are green ( ordered from high to low ) : * monaco * estonia * austria * czech republic * latvia * germany * bulgaria * switzerland * luxembourg * lithuania * slovakia * hungary * malta, 
  source : http://operabase.com/ base map : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:european_union_map.svg the top 10 ( edit : numbers per million population ) : * monaco 238.1 * estonia 27.4 * austria 26.1 * czech republic 20.7 * latvia 19.8 * germany 19.1 * bulgaria 18.6 * switzerland 16.1 * luxembourg 16.0 * lithuania 15.2 edit : i made a more color-blind friendly version : http://i.imgur.com/qpxhzkr.png,

  it 's a very different situation because greece and turkey are allies and because turkey had announced in advance they would shoot down aircraft violating their border . 
  if greece had made a similar warning and they were not allies , they would have every right to shoot down military aircraft violating their borders , especially after repeatedly warning them to turn back . 
  they do what they need to do to defend their border . 
  they do n't want the situation to escalate beyond that . 
  it 's not a strange stance . 
  feel free to provide an alternative proposal . 
  i tried to stick to existing boundaries where possible , but also tried to balance out the population numbers as closely as possible . 
  for example , cyprus + greece is not big enough , so they need a good chunk of bulgaria . 
  the remainder can only go to romania , which in turn needs to cede a part to hungary and so on . 
  fwiw some areas merged here have been part of prussia or austria-hungary together in the past so it could work . 
  requires some other shifts as well , but the result is probably nicer than the original : http://i.imgur.com/f7ebdad.png, 
  good suggestions . 
  based on this i renamed the regions : * atlantic france -  brittany-aquitania ( the historical region of brittany is more populous than aquitania ) * mediterranean france -  provence * north italy -  lombary-piedmont ( cisalpine seems to refer to a larger region and this seems more in line with the others ) * middle italy -  rome * south italy -  magna graecia * spain -  andalusia unfortunately imgur does not seem to allow me to replace the existing image , so [ here it is ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vekd6bk.png ) . 
  this is what the eu could look like if borders were redrawn to create 28 member states of more or less equal population sizes . 
  some notes : * source for population data : [ eurostat demo_r_d2jan ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-demography-migration-projections/population-data/database ) ( year : 2014 ) * source for map : [ eurostat nuts 2013 shapefiles ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units ) * borders are changed at the nuts2 level * names are generally based on the largest unit * the french overseas regions are excluded * the canary islands , azores and madeira have been moved to fit on the map * the netherlands looks bad , this seems to be an issue with the eurostat map . 
  maybe nl will look this in the future though . 
  population numbers for the proposed member states : * bayern - 17548812 * nordrhein-westfalen - 17571856 * atlantic france - 17574896 * poland - 17580394 * east germany - 17655316 * hessen - 17688906 * denmark-niedersachen - 17734871 * hungary-croatia - 17794049 * middle italy - 17851135 * ireland-scotland - 17864115 * austria-veneto - 17885604 * catalonia - 17886324 * north england - 17946914 * czechoslovakia - 18011914 * paris - 18088015 * north italy - 18117676 * south england - 18132822 * romania - 18192904 * greece-bulgaria - 18194671 * belgium - 18217657 * scandinavia - 18243322 * london-normandy - 18300031 * south italy - 18354201 * portugal - 18413294 * spain - 18472716 * baltics - 18473271 * mediterranean france - 18497893 * netherlands - 18638701, 
  the reality is that you 're actually voting for a german party , the european `` parties '' are actually alliances of national-level parties . 
  the meps do not need to support the alde/epp/pes / ... in votes but they are generally expected to back their national party line . 
  as an example , two of the main dutch parties ( vvd and d66 ) are both part of alde , but that does n't mean voting for one or the other makes no difference . 
   the country 's political debate has been dominated by a complacent progressive elite who firmly believes society can be designed and planned . 
  here in the netherlands these ideas have long died out even in the left wing . 
  are they still common in belgium ? 
  back ? 
  all the land you have you stole from us . 
  it 's actually worse than the map shows . 
  traditional amsterdammers ( a small group nowadays ) can easily be distinguished from what is shown as midden-hollands and rotterdammers from zuid-hollands . 
  comparing against their most comparable neighbors - the netherlands , germany and luxembourg - they perform worse than all the others on every indicator , with noticeable gaps on political stability , government effectiveness and regulatory quality . 
  the only neighbor they compare to in a favorable way is france . 
  `` one silly trick to completely eliminate islamist fundamentalism . 
  jihadis will hate you ! '', 
  in amsterdam there was a similar demonstration with only syrian/iraqi refugees , so plenty of muslims . 
  most of the dutch population would gladly take belgium ( or at least flanders ) back . 
  it might not be a bad idea . 
  although there are always some idiots , the dutch government and municipalities have been fairly successful in preventing the creation of ghettos and the internal division in belgium would probably be less of an issue if it were part of a larger whole .
