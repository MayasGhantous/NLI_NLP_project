  like a capital or something . 
  i like the flag and feel it represents the eu and to some extent also myself . 
  i like brussels as a city but it being the capital of europe feels more as an administrative thing than a symbol . 
  i like the ode to joy as a piece of music but i feel it does n't represent the eu given that it has much more history on its own well before the eu existed . 
   can you imagine to reduce one day the official language to one , for exemple english even if you like your national language more ( i mean , it is the easiest , why not ? ), 
  it is important to ensure that everyone can communicate , which means making sure people in every country know at least some english . 
  i see no reason however why any country would need to change their primary language and it is also pretty much unthinkable that this would happen . 
  even in the netherlands and scandinavia , where almost everyone can speak english , this is not happening at all . 
   and can you people imagine one day to have ( or maybe you already have it ) as primary identity europe and as second , more of an regional identity , the nation ? 
  it is possible but hard to predict whether it will actually happen . 
  i do n't think it is likely . 
  isa has unfortunately passed away now, 
  #update 2015-04-16 : isa has sadly passed away ; thanks very much for making her last days more enjoyable but please do not send any more cards from this point onward, 
  got ta catch them all !, 
  it is unfair , everyone knows elizabeth is immortal, 
  at least / u/dclauzel seems to provide honest translations so i would n't say he is the big enemy of english language here . 
  if you only speak english you missed a lot of hidden messages from the others who post in multiple languages . 
  interesting , for me `` g '' and `` ch '' represent exactly the same sound, 
  in ipa , the dutch one is / \u028b / and the english one / w / . 
  a [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/labiodental_approximant ) on the dutch pronunciation of this letter does suggest that southern dutch uses a different sound , namely [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiced_bilabial_fricative ) , but again it is not the same sound that is used in english . 
  for me the `` w '' is the only difference between the two, 
  does a majority primarily speak frisian in frisia then ( not saying they do n't , just unsure ) ? 
  true , it 's hard to draw a line . 
  all the examples except canada derive from latin in the end ( canada from iroquoian through french ) but have been in use for a long time . 
  i agree it would be more accurate to say that no germanic-derived words have a `` c '' in dutch ( as far as i know at least ) . 
  i imagine on schiermonnikoog they need to take a throat lozenge every time they pronounce the name of the island . 
  they use the english `` w '' as a reference point and it is not the same as the dutch one . 
  english `` want '' is not pronounced the same way as dutch `` want '' for example . 
  i think the surinam accent of dutch does use the same `` w '' sound as the english though ( at least it is very similar ) . 
   if we strip all the ~ ~ latin ~ ~ loanwords from the ~ ~ germanic ~ ~ english , do we have enough left to ~ ~ convey ~ ~ thoughts ? 
  ~ ~ latin ~ ~ loanwords have been in ~ ~ use ~ ~ for a very long time , i 'm not ~ ~ sure ~ ~ it makes ~ ~ sense ~ ~ to strip them of the dutch ~ ~ language ~ ~ either . 
  ftfy edit : also use , thanks / u/lovebyte, 
  sure , but are any of them native rather than loan words from latin ? 
  not that i know of . 
  this corresponds with legend entry for german : `` in german , `` qu '' sounds like `` kv '' , and is noly present in latin-derived words '' . 
  definitely . 
  and as your example shows , in english they did n't even bother to come up with an orthography that systematically distinguishes the vowel sounds in writing . 
  thanks , updated it, 
  we do that in dutch ( though we would usually say it 's `` kw '' rather than `` kv '' ) and we were n't marked like that . 
  maybe they were swapped ? 
  the latin alphabet is a rather poor fit with the dutch language . 
  the vowels are worse than the consonants , considering all the tricks we need to get a sufficient number of vowels . 
  these words all use a different vowel : as , aas , pet , heet , pit , piet , pot , poot , oor , put , huur , ijs , poet , kou , reus , huis . 
  we have at least 16 vowels while latin only has 5 . 
  edit : / u/rubykuby is right , changed accordingly, 
  the `` q '' in dutch is used exactly like in german , as the combination `` qu '' from latin loan words, 
  i think the flemish will not take kindly to the suggestion that their `` g '' sounds the same as the one in netherlands dutch . 
  flanders in belgium and brabant/limburg in the netherlands use a less guttural `` g '' . 
  eu integration certainly plays a big role ( with the mainstream parties pro-europe and more extreme parties eurosceptic ) but other foreign policy , even though they get debated , do n't really seem to influence how people vote . 
  i still do n't fully understand why these refugees are so insistent on going to the uk . 
  france is a safe and wealthy country . 
  crossing the channel without papers is hard and dangerous and they can never get a legal status if it has been documented that they have been in france first . 
  why not just apply for asylum in france ( or in spain/italy if that 's where they entered europe ) ? 
  time to send some russian soldiers on vacation in the north sea then, 
  preferably before putin comes in to liberate the repressed oil wells . 
  there 's a huge gap between a massacre and a genocide though . 
  the netherlands only has a few thousand armenians , on a population of almost 17 million . 
  there is no armenian lobby .

  veel liefs , [ me ] en [ my girlfriend ] . 
  many countries require children below a certain age to go to school , not just roma children . 
  would you consider enforcing those laws for everyone ( including roma ) to be violence ? 
  in the netherlands at least you do n't need to be registered to vote . 
  if you are allowed to vote , you will get sent proof that you can take to the poll station . 
  there are definitely news sources for expats in english in the netherlands and within the eu expats are allowed to vote in local elections . 
  in addition , some parties communicate with their voters in english and turkish . 
  it is perfectly possible to vote and be informed about dutch politics without speaking dutch . 
  as you say , romania is a poor country . 
  yet , most romanians do n't commit any crimes , even if they are poor . 
  the roma , on the other hand , do . 
  although poverty is certainly a factor , it can not be the only factor . 
  if their culture finds crime against outsiders acceptable , i do n't see how you could just ignore that and not blame their culture . 
  i was never talking about forcing them into apartments either ( and , lets be honest , not much would be left of those apartments after a year in the current situation ) . 
  i was talking about ensuring that their children get an education . 
  do you truly feel that is harmful ? 
  yes , and this is something that could be addressed in large part by them removing the elements i just mentioned from their culture while they can keep their identities otherwise . 
  reducing discrimination is also important but there is no realistic way that can be addressed until this is solved . 
  i 'm not sure what point you 're trying to make . 
  do you deny these elements are in their culture or do you think they are n't harmful ? 
  i see no reason why they would have to get rid of positive cultural elements ( like music , clothing , cuisine , language , ... ) to integrate into society . 
  other ethnic minorities also manage to keep such elements while integrating in modern society . 
  however , i see nothing worth keeping such cultural elements as preventing children from going to school or teaching them that crime is not bad if the victim is outside the community .
