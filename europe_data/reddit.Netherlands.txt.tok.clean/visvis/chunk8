  they are specifically asking for it though . 
  ik stuur je een paar foto 's / plaatjes [ pick the former in case of photographs , the latter in case of drawings ] en hoop dat je ze leuk vindt . 
  incredible !, 
  i 'm so happy they recovered !, 
  i understand , but it is important to note that the child herself does n't know she is terminal . 
  in addition , i feel in a situation like this one can not give up the hope that a miracle might happen , however unlikely that is . 
  many people here are helping with translations , just post the english text here and there will be someone to help you . 
  the parents would be able to read english and they could translate . 
  however , in dutch the older daughter might be able to read it . 
  translation : hallo uit canada !, 
  great job , potverdorie !, 
  good idea , done, 
  a three-year old might understand that but any explanation from the parents would be accepted without doubt . 
  also , [ this ] ( https://www.hospicenet.org/html/understand.html ) suggests children do n't really start understanding what death is before the age of 6 . 
  great text !, 
  thanks !, 
  i believe the thread did in fact reach the front page in europe . 
  if you can think of a suitable global default sub ( or any suitable sub with a new audience for that matter ) feel free to post !, 
  sorry about losing the rhyme , i would also add the original for its better poetic qualities . 
  perfect !, 
   i 've left a flip book in the envelope with a short animation i made for you . 
  awesome !, 
  can you post a video ? 
  thanks for the gold !, 
  also , this is an awesome letter . 
  ik woon in kansas city . 
  dat ligt midden in amerika [ note : children here are more likely to recognize the name america than us ; write verenigde staten if you prefer us ] . 
  awesome !, 
  very nice !, 
  translation below . 
  i understand the concern but the source article is a regional public broadcaster so this story is certainly not a fake . 
  nice !, 
  that is actually kind of sensible . 
  awesome !, 
  translation : hoi isa , mijn naam is emilia . 
  she does n't know it is terminal . 
  in addition , in situations like this i feel it is better to keep some hope . 
  unexpected recoveries have happened before . 
  anywhere would be great . 
  there is no location specified in the article and it would be great to surprise them with cards from all over the world . 
  english should work as her parents should be able to translate , but there are quite a few people here helping with translations as well . 
  all you 're saying sounds great . 
  one note before the translation : `` how are you '' is not used a greeting in dutch and asking it generally means you 're looking for an honest answer ( which , in this case , would likely be quite negative ) . 
  i would recommend leaving it out . 
  making a dying child happy is a good deed in my book, 
  sure , sounds good, 
  sounds great !, 
  istm a store bought postcard would be absolutely fine . 
  even better if it came in an envelope . 
  great idea !, 
  i posted it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/assistance/comments/31v8nv/threeyear_old_girl_with_terminal_brain_cancer/ ) . 
  i 'm assuming she is getting the very best care that is available and money is not an issue in the dutch health care system , especially for minors as they get free healthcare . 
  i think she and her family would be very happy with just the postcards . 
  edit : missing `` not '' , thanks / u/blogem, 
  fun fact : the word `` knuffels '' not only means `` hugs '' but also `` stuffed toys '' . 
  translation : `` hoi , isa en suus !, 
  anything will so . 
  maybe something like `` van harte beterschap !, 
  groeten uit duitsland '' ( i hope you get well soon !, 
  greetings from germany ) . 
  this is a good translation , but i think a child would be more familiar with the names of the specific countries in the uk so i would consider replacing `` verenigd koninkrijk '' with engeland ( england ) , schotland ( scotland ) , wales or noord-ierland ( northern ireland ) . 
  the `` van harte '' does n't mean congratulations here , that is only in the context `` van harte gefeliciteerd '' which is often shortened to just `` van harte '' . 
  the additional `` beterschap '' makes clear that this is not the case here . 
  i would say `` van harte '' is best translated to cordial/heartfelt here . 
  the other phrases are also fine though . 
  this text is fine but a bit uncommon in dutch . 
  generally speaking a child her age would neither read nor speak foreign languages in the netherlands . 
  her parents would almost certainly be able to read english and translate . 
  however , i 'll gladly translate whatever you want to put on the card as well if you post it here . 
  the simplest message would probably be `` van harte beterschap '' which translates to `` i hope you get well '' . 
  sounds good to me . 
  they did n't tell the girl it is terminal though . 
  also in a situation like this it seems it is best to never give up hope ( though that is of course a very personal choice ) . 
  thanks !, 
  i used your translation ( with credits ) in another post , hope you do n't mind . 
  thanks , i did / r/randomactsofcards ( [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofcards/comments/31unhc/request_threeyear_old_girl_with_terminal_brain/ ) ) and will do / r/penpals when i can submit again . 
  edit : / r/penpals post [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/31uo8k/3fnetherlands_little_girl_with_brain_cancer_would/ ), 
  so you 're going for french efficiency then ? 
  just a matter of time ... 
  i got almost equal percentages for the top four parties ( in the order conservative , ukip , libdem , labour ) . 
  interesting , because on the dutch election helper websites i always get huge differences between the parties . 
  i wonder whether this has to do with the first-past-the-post system requiring parties to compete for the median voter . 
  he did n't invade other countries though, 
  depends on how many greeks vote, 
  neither , through some googling i found that the picture was almost certainly taken [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@52.203374,4.789957,3a,75y,261.49h,79.45t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1skk9xveky0gpcjjqdfu0tng!2e0 ) and that means [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@52.201695,4.783421,3a,25.7y,226.54h,96.54t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1smshpij7yb8fz6byybublpg!2e0 ) must be the sign you 're seeing . 
  am i being detained ? 
  we 've pretty much forgiven you about supporting belgium 's secession by now and i do n't see what else we would have against france . 
  fwiw i gave you guys 10 points . 
  oil wealth seems to be a big factor here . 
  i somehow doubt libya and saudi arabia are really such great places to live . 
  did crimea not move timezones now that it is effectively controlled by russia ? 
  wherever that is , it looks great, 
  germany ? 
  this only tells me that you 're not from either latvia or ireland, 
  that 's pretty sensible , would n't be able to see the potholes in time otherwise, 
  you live on mars ? 
  i do n't know which country but the timing is certainly appropriate . 
  good point !, 
  probably russia , but i believe france also has a launch site, 
  and also they are comfy and easy to wear,
