  seeing the sun can be overwhelming to use northeners, 
  poland ? 
  [ latvia ] ( https://imicrothinking.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/whitebackground1920x1200.jpg ), 
  then where are the kangaroos ? 
  seems to be [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@51.513799,-0.140731,3a,75y,115.29h,91.6t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sqxmu0tbov2eddm9irn8hoq!2e0 ), 
  interesting idea to use a stereotype rather than a landscape . 
  it works ; instant recognition . 
  norway ? 
  there are large differences between them . 
  for example , although both have a bad name , almere is actually much better than lelystad because they learned from prior experiences . 
  the new neighborhoods being built in almere also clearly look better than the older ones . 
  [ cycling path in a polder ] ( https://wimwegman.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/img_1877b.jpg ), 
  despite the excellent points from / u/beerkar , the netherlands was actually on the way to become car-centric until the 1970s . 
  however , the netherlands was hit especially hard by the oil crisis and there was heavy campaining by `` stop de kindermoord '' ( stop the child murder ) against the large number of traffic accidents caused by cars . 
  as a consequence , a deliberate and very effective move towards encouraging cycling and public transport was made . 
  this involves both heavily taxing cars and building an extensive cycling infrastructure . 
  can someone explain the truck showing saint angela ? 
  maybe most of the stuff from china arrives in antwerp and is then resold across europe ? 
  it would seem very hard for a dictator to stay in power without any allies at all . 
  surely there must be some group in belarus that supports his rule ? 
  unemployment fine should be higher then, 
  the top experts for each policy area, 
  i believe you just [ changed your order of succession ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/succession_to_the_crown_act_2013 ) to match ours though . 
  interesting , we lost luxembourg in exactly the same way . 
  i suppose the eu needs to harmonize succession laws first . 
  i imagine a common enemy might be the perfect solution for the israel-palestine conflict . 
  only if we adopt latin as the official language . 
  this is unfair , everyone knows queen elizabeth is immortal . 
  historically speaking , i think whoever leads the eu would have to be an emperor , not a president . 
  i propose that we start breeding crown princes and princesses throughout europe and we crown the end result as emperor of the european empire . 
  as an added advantage , the uk would now be in personal union with most of europe , making it impossible for them to opt out . 
  not just the nature . 
  have you been to vienna ? 
  you guys are even lower though . 
  prepare for an influx of irish looking to take your jobs for a change . 
  what makes it not smart ? 
  it attracts companies that would not have come there otherwise and , even if it 's not as much as in their home countries , they do pay some taxes . 
  the issue here is that the optimal strategy for indivual countries is detrimental to the group of countries as a whole . 
  this can only be solved at the eu level . 
  could you repeat the inflections of `` dog '' in finnish once more ? 
  it seems questionable to compare greece and bulgaria as bulgaria ( along with the rest of eastern europe ) is still catching up to its economic potential after the fall of communism . 
  growth is easier to achieve there at the moment and that makes it easier to finance government expenses as well . 
  and the netherlands beat finland, 
  true . 
  our scotland is the north of the country as well , especially the province of groningen . 
  the good part is that you can into nordics now, 
  that is what this is though . 
  only small-scale and limited scope but hence the comments about other countries joining . 
  also , the shaming played a major role in setting up those boycotts for south africa . 
  south africa, 
  my spanish is n't great but that does n't look like an accurate translation, 
  i may be misunderstanding this , but it seems like they were detaining her because she had overstayed her visa , not because she was going to get married . 
  she should probably have applied for the new visa earlier or returned to india until the new visa was approved . 
  it 's not entirely wrong , though it might be more accurate to say that the netherlands has one capital city , which one it is depending on how you define a capital city . 
  interesting how the netherlands has two capitals on this map . 
  ca n't say it 's entirely wrong but usually only amsterdam is marked . 
  the stig may need to reveal his/her identity to be able to receive a russian visa . 
  big news indeed !, 
  anyone who can confirm first-hand that this is in fact true ? 
  has the bosnian state lost control over this village ? 
  after the false reports about sharia neighborhoods in various european cities i feel there is a risk an article like this might be greatly blown out of proportion . 
  can we have a separate color for below sea level ? 
  that would make the netherlands less boring . 
  i 've had six years of french in school and , although i can read some french , could n't even have the simplest conversation in french right now . 
  i personally have nothing against them but i personally prefer bratkartoffeln or south german kartoffelsalad . 
  i disagree . 
  the [ original paper ] ( http://web.natur.cuni.cz/etologiecloveka/images/download/kohoutova,%20rubesova,%20havlicek%20-%202011%20-%20shaving%20of%20axillary%20hair%20has%20only%20a%20transient%20effect%20on%20perceived%20body%20odor%20pleasantness.pdf ) did find a significant difference for freshly shaved ( < 1 week ) armpits :  in session 1 , we found a significant difference between the odors of shaved and unshaved armpits of donor group n . the axillary odor of shaved armpits was rated as more pleasant ( t_27 = 2.80 ; p = 0.009 ) , more attractive ( t_27 = 2.28 , p = 0.03 ) and less intense ( t_27 = 6.55 ; p < 0.001 ) than the odor of unshaved armpits . 
  it is not the only result in the paper , but it is definitely one of the findings . 
  people shave their balls ? 
  til . 
  this is exactly my experience . 
  whatever the reasoning behind it , shaving takes the smell away and just washing does not . 
  german food is awesome . 
  if it were n't for watching my health , i 'd love to have schnitzel/bratwurst/currywurst / beer all the time . 
  i 'm dutch though . 
  just to add some science to the discussion : women [ prefer the smell of freshly shaved armpits ] ( http://www.livescience.com/17768-men-shaved-armpits-smell-women-hair.html ) in men, 
  exactly . 
  man legs are simply not meant to be exposed . 
  i keep mine covered whenever it is practical ( in practice , whenever i 'm not working out ) . 
  the hairs themselves get smelly over time and soap + water does n't take that smell away entirely . 
  dutch man here : i shave my armpits every 1-2 weeks . 
  if it 's too long i feel smelly even after i just showered . 
  i sweat really quickly though . 
  this has happened in the past and i do n't think most estonians really liked it . 
  wow , that 's actually a pretty grave sin for muslims . 
  yet another one . 
  why do they even pretend to be muslims ? 
  isis probably buries them within 24 hours but generally speaking it is the norm that bodies are returned to their families . 
  brilliant , now they ca n't resist when we take back our land from them . 
  you 're welcome , belgium, 
  this is cheating though . 
  if you have actual poverty like greece does , there are many more homeless without addiction/mental illness issues , who are more likely to do well in such a championship . 
  but who will protect us when the germans invade ? 
  though i share your concern about the dolfinarium , the circuses are definitely in another league of animal cruelty . 
  this is my point . 
  romania is actually pretty nice compared to most of the world , especially compared to afghanistan . 
  kinda like when a child of rich parents starts crying when he gets a bmw for his birthday if he wanted a porsche . 
  observer state . 
  the difference is important here : few people would deny that the palestinians are a nation while it was only relatively recently ( and with a lot of controversy ) recognized as a state . 
  that food is of no use with a system to distribute it .
