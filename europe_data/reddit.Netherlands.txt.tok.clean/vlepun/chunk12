  no gas would n't be a major problem for another 10 months or so , but oil would . 
  yes , i already said so . 
  again , it 's doable . 
  in fact , in the near future it 's necessary . 
  if anything , putin 's recent move has shown that the eu should * not * allow itself to be dependent upon russia for this type of thing . 
   if russia was n't important why did the g7 countries actually go to russia to be in sotji after all the crimes putin already committed ? 
  for some reason they have to think that russia is important , and as with everything else the facts are n't important . 
  diplomacy . 
  also , russia is a big * potential * market for european companies . 
  that 's considered to be more important than the small crimes of putin ( because he had n't invaded ukraine yet , the second he did , sochi was cancelled ) . 
  you mistake ` different ' for ` wrong ' . 
   i did n't think poland or romania had the power to move enough soldiers fast enough to be a threat , maybe they could ? 
  well , romania has quite a sizeable army ( wikipedia rounds up to 170.000 troops ) . 
  i do n't know how organized they are , so let 's assume they ca n't move fast enough . 
  it still leaves poland , which has already mobilized and moved it 's tanks to the border with ukraine . 
  germany has n't been able to participate in military actions largely because of treaties and conditions put on them by world war 2 . 
  it does however have a well equipped , well organized , highly professional army , and they work closely together with both the dutch and french armies . 
  i 'd be surprised if they 'd sit idly by when the shit hits the fan . 
  especially because i 've heard explosions coming from zwolle 's live round exercise area ( tank/howitzer/apc training ground for dutch/german armed forces ) and an increase in training flights for the dutch f16 's in the north . 
  to be honest , i think russia 's importance to the eu is overestimated . 
  we do n't really do anything with them except buy their natural resources , most of which could be replaced ( it 'd be incredibly costly , but it 's not impossible ) . 
  yes , but that 's not what the guy said in the interview . 
  apparently someone 's opinion can differ from the eu 's official stance . 
  well , i know for a fact we sold the tanks to the fins , but i have heard big explosions coming from the training grounds near zwolle recently . 
  there has also been an increase in training flights for the f16 's in the north . 
   the only countries who could assemble a reasonably sized force would be the uk , france or the us ( maybe canada ? ) . 
  the us is n't likely to get in a war with russia over ukraine , nor is the uk or france . 
  it is honestly not that important . 
  you 're forgetting poland , germany and romania . 
  all have a considerable army . 
  also , it 's unlikely that any one country would go against russia on it 's own . 
  that 's just stupid . 
  ** if ** there 's going to be a military intervention , it 's going to be a coordinated one . 
  do n't forget we 've got the eu now . 
  i also do n't agree with your last sentence . 
  granted , ukraine is not important to the usa , but it ** is ** important to the european union in terms of geopolitical influence . 
  while i do n't see a military intervention happening any time soon , i would n't say it 's entirely impossible . 
  these kinds of consultation rounds never are in the best interests of consumers . 
  thank you , also for the other insightful comments . 
  i bet they can be . 
  he 's referring to the v250 which is also italian-made . 
  they were so horrible that the order has been cancelled and it is now being settled in court . 
  we used bushmasters that were supported by leopard 's , howitzers , f16 's , apaches , the lot . 
  an armoured personnel carrier is no replacement for a main battle tank by any stretch of the imagination . 
  the army is replacing all g-classes and land rovers with vw amarok-mil 's . 
   it 's got optronics far in advance of any aircraft flying [ . ], 
  is n't that only bolt on for the us versions ? 
  i thought the export versions ( which we 're getting ) have modified optronics ( among other things ) when compared to the us version of the same aircraft . 
  do n't forget to offer him the mercedes-benz g-classes and land rovers we 're selling as well . 
  hardly ever been used !, 
  to be honest , if there 's one european army , there would be one budget . 
  that budget could be bigger than the current individual budgets , so you could research more and buy more due to buying in bulk . 
  but for it to really work , i guess you 'd need one true federal union , not the semi-federal union the eu is now . 
  perhaps some time in the future we 'll get to see this . 
  it depends on where the battle takes place and against who . 
  in an ideal world , there 'd be one european army and the tanks of that army are n't necessarily stationed in the netherlands . 
  i think they could be used better elsewhere . 
  a lot of it would . 
  the netherlands has quite a large military industry actually . 
  which is true , but that does n't negate the fact that in such conflicts we could bring our own tanks , and now we ca n't . 
  that makes deploying to such conflicts a bit more difficult as you 'll have to solely rely on allied tanks . 
  it 's not an ideal situation . 
  to use in stuff like afghanistan , where they were actually deployed . 
  i agree . 
  it really is a bit weird that with all the cooperation and integration , defence is still a national thing . 
  it could be much more efficient if it was an eu thing . 
  actually the budget cuts are what made them obsolete . 
  had the budget cuts not been deemed necessary by our government , the tanks would not have been sold . 
  it really is that simple . 
  edit : words are difficult . 
  i do n't think we have that either . 
  the netherlands does have a couple ( k/d ) c-130 's though . 
  these tanks are sold because * all * of the tank divisions are being made obsolete by budget cuts . 
  nothing is going to be bought with the money we get from this deal . 
  it 's going straight to the state budget to decrease the deficit . 
  why not try it ? 
  it 's less stupid than what this woman is doing . 
  the rest of europe is insured against this as well . 
  we use our eyes to see if there 's a gap and react accordingly . 
  also , it 's a fucking train station , of course there 's going to be a gap . 
  yeah , my bad . 
  typed it as i was catching the train . 
  i 'll edit it to stop the confusion . 
  yeah , this title is a bit misleading actually . 
  moody 's still has the netherlands rated aaa , as does fitch . 
  both moody 's and fitch have the netherlands down as aaa with a stable outlook . 
  s&p has downgraded the netherlands to aa + with a ~ ~ positive ~ ~ stable outlook ( from aaa with a negative outlook ) . 
  based in part on what they regard a `` brittle agreement '' due to the fact that the agreement is supported by the opposition . 
  something which in the netherlands is seen as a good thing and actually gives more support to that agreement . 
  also financial markets have already adjusted during the past few months so neither country will really notice this change . 
  alright i 've looked it up . 
  it 's nice that cbs statline is a public source . 
  now there are a couple of things that are nice to know if you 're not dutch and also ca n't read our language . 
  these are translations of the definitions the cbs uses for it 's figures . 
  in [ this table ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=81947ned&amp;d1=0-1,12,18,22,25-28,39,45,49,52-53&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=0-4&amp;d5=%28l-2%29-l&amp;hdr=g2,g1,g3,g4&amp;stb=t&amp;vw=t ) i 'm going from left to right ( and unfortunately these figures are not available in english ) . 
  this includes * only * those individuals that are or have been part of an official police investigation into criminal acts . 
  scientific research in the netherlands relies on these figures as well as on anonymous self-report questionnaires , however , this second part of data is behind a pay wall as they 're part of scientific publications . 
  there are a few things to keep in mind here . 
  again , this only accounts for those suspects that have been a part of official police investigations into criminal acts * and have been registered as such * . 
  keep in mind that someone who has been captured for multiple cases will only be registered * once per case * .
