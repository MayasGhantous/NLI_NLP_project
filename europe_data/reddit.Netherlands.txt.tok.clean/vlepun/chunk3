  also , total troop strength will be around 7000 . 
  that 's enough to hold the ground for a while . 
  i 'm not of the warmongering sort , but this is a bit embarrassing . 
  yeah , same here . 
  i was embarrassed when i heard the news . 
  especially because they brought it like it was a huge contribution on our part ... 
  it 's such a shame there 's not decent political party that understands geopolitics around any more . 
  no , the pipe is lying on the floor , broken . 
  the book is in the loo or the fire , and you 're lying underneath the chair , with a bottle of vodka next to your vomit . 
   i certainly would n't poke fun at any of the countries that are volunteering troops to this reaction force . 
  oh come on , ca n't we poke fun at our own nation 's inability to pledge a decent amount of soldiers ? 
  i mean , my country pledged 200 soldiers . 
  out of roughly 47.000 total . 
  that 's not even the bare minimum i 'd say . 
  on the other hand , i applaud the commitment of the british , and i wish the politicians of my country would do the same . 
  i also hope this whole thing has made it very , very clear that they need to be preparing for war and thus that they need to stop killing our armed forces one budget cut at the time . 
  the netherlands will supply 100 soldiers to the new rapid reaction force of nato . 
  minister of defence hennis stated before the start of the nato-summit in wales . 
  the soldiers will be deployable from next year onwards . 
  nato announced earlier this week that it wants to incorporate a second rapid reacton force . 
  it already has a quick reaction force which is deployable anywhere in the world within five days , but the members of nato feel that 's not fast enough . 
  a ` very high readiness joint task force ' should be able to deploy even faster . 
  the task force should exist of 4000 troops and will most likely be stationed in eastern europe . 
  it 's expected that the summit in wales will see a decision of the incorporation of this task force . 
  ** `` aggressive behaviour '' ** nato chief rasmussen stated earlier this week that the intervention force a reaction is to `` russia 's aggressive behaviour '' in ukraine . 
  he stressed the unit could also be deployed elsewhere . 
  first exercises are likely to be held in the beginning of next year . 
  = = i 'm very sorry to the rest of the eu that our defence is in such a state that we ca n't even provide the new nato task force with a decent amount of soldiers and materiel , but what are you going to do about it ? 
   arias ca\u00f1ete [ 1 ] for ... research and innovation ?!, 
  that 's a joke [ 2 ] , is n't it ? 
  why would it be a joke ? 
  he 's certainly doing a lot of research in those pictures . 
   investment of french companies in russia . 
  a big , famous automaker ( psa peugeot citro\u00ebn ? 
  i do n't remember ) for example invested a few years ago in russia . 
  poutine could seize its local assets . 
  you mean renault-nissan . 
  they have a majority stake in avtovaz and have poured billions into that company to update the factories and models that lada sells . 
  it sounds like the eu is n't really ready to do anything that would actually put them in a position of power over russia in this whole conflict . 
  it 's a shame , because the longer this drags on , the more it 's going to cost everyone involved . 
  they do n't have official , permanent bases , but they will get at least one . 
  and that one will house the 10.000 strong rapid reaction force , if it 's accorded by the upcoming nato summit in wales . 
   is there work done to look for other markets ? 
  look at the long-term figures . 
  the finnish markets have been shifting away from russia for about 5 to 10 years now . 
   yet , it will be an interesting time if a `` small '' nato member with a more or less crazy leadership gets attacked . 
  there 's no denying that . 
  especially with the crippled european military forces , it 'll be interesting to say the least . 
  the member that is under attack . 
  but instead of asking me , follow the link i gave you earlier . 
  it leads directly to nato 's website and they explain all your question in detail . 
   if germany says `` we sent poland two ambulances to help '' , germany fulfilled its obligations with regards to nato . 
  yeah , no . 
  see , the thing about the article is that an attack on any one member , is to be treated as an attack on your own country and you are required to react accordingly . 
  now , reacting accordingly is up to what the attacked country needs at that moment . 
  it can indeed be humanitarian aid , logistical supports , humint or sigint , military aid or all of the above . 
  and it will also immediately be reported to the un security counsil , so the unsc can act . 
  so , to answer your question : yes , an attack on poland by russia , with official military forces , will lead to a declaration of war against russia by all of nato . 
   there are no laws that say that other nato have to retaliate or consider that an attack . 
  really ? 
   ** article 5 **  the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that , if such an armed attack occurs , each of them , in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by article 51 of the charter of the united nations , will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , such action as it deems necessary , including the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area . 
   any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the security council . 
  such measures shall be terminated when the security council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security . 
   ** article 6 ( 1 ) **  for the purpose of article 5 , an armed attack on one or more of the parties is deemed to include an armed attack :  * on the territory of any of the parties in europe or north america , on the algerian departments of france ( 2 ) , on the territory of or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the parties in the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer ;  * on the forces , vessels , or aircraft of any of the parties , when in or over these territories or any other area in europe in which occupation forces of any of the parties were stationed on the date when the treaty entered into force or the mediterranean sea or the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer . 
  [ source for further reading . 
  ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm ) in short , an attack by an external party on a member of nato , will lead to that member invoking article 5 and thus , as a consequence , will be treated as an attack on all members of nato . 
  you do n't want to face nato 's full military force . 
  not even when you 're russia and you 've got nuclear assets . 
   countries ought to do what 's best for themselves alone . 
  yeah , this is the viewpoint of last century . 
  you need to think more globally these days . 
  what 's in it for the eu to have another member also be a member of nato ? 
   as someone who is anti war i 'm glad ireland is neutral and hope it remains that way . 
  you do realize that ireland has deployed forces to nato/un-warzones right ? 
  ireland also contributes forces to eu battlegroups . 
  i hate to break it to you , but ireland is n't a neutral country by any means . 
  why ca n't it be both ? 
  actually no . 
  the russian federations armed forces are in the midst of an extensive modernisation programme . 
  they need the equipment the ukrainians can manufacture in the amounts needed . 
  losing those suppliers will put the modernisations programme years behind schedule , and vastly over budget . 
  we live in a weird world . 
   if they are kia relatives forced to be silent about it . 
  what happened in pskov then ? 
  there have been reports of closed burials and mourning ceremonies for troops from pskov vdv that were killed in action in ukraine . 
  are they allowed to even do that ? 
  they did it right the first time !, 
   the stiftung warentest ( highly regarded german consumer testing organisation ) regularly tests vacuums , always coming to the same conclusion : [ 1 ] wattage is in no way related to sucking power . 
  it 's a shame the test results are behind a paywall . 
  it looks like something that should be public knowledge . 
  there goes the joke ... luckily i still have my old zanussi 2400w environmental disaster . 
  i 'd better get that new dyson quickly then . 
  you know why we have these ugly ass plates ? 
  yes , that 's right , money !, 
  the yellow/black combination is the one that is visible under most circumstances compared to other combinations . 
  which makes it ideal for radar-systems . 
   does , say , the netherlands have veto power on all these judicial and regulatory matters ? 
  every full member of the eu has veto power , and if there is n't ( for instance , you ca n't veto a judicial ruling by one of the high eu courts of justice ) , you can put a mep to work if you want to get the law changed . 
   it 's not like they have to implement everything in the eu , just things that pertain to trade and travel . 
  or am i wrong ?
