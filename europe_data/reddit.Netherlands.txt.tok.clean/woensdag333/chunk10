  in europe : you work to live . 
  in america : you live to work . 
  look at this silly one . 
  why not ask your doctors for some healthcare , they 'll also look surprised to you , because they do n't want to !, 
  stupid complaints for what ? 
  stick to mcdonalds or kfc , americunt . 
  what type of path ? 
  cycling , strolling , horse riding ? 
  so are the low countries , i mean country , because belgium is being silly . 
  there can be only * one * . 
  i read that as `` lemonade '' . 
  i do n't think this has any credibility at all . 
  this author , from what i 've read , writes like a twat . 
  i quite dislike erdogan , but the add was quite terrible , in my opinion . 
  i was taught both , although my french is quite bad now , sadly . 
  i like german a lot , but i also like french a lot . 
  i 'd say , choose the most beneficial one . 
  german is better for the business world , i think , because of it 's economy . 
  french is better for well ... france and it 's colonies . 
  perhaps if you want to learn a romantic language , french is a stepping stone . 
  perhaps prices go down . 
  latvia of sell much potato now !, 
  i would n't be so sure of your statement . 
  a new zealander 's favourite post . 
  album available next week . 
  sealand . 
  i thought it said `` lil metro '' because it 's a small one . 
  great rapper 's name though . 
  i 'd love to visit the scandinavian countries one day , but i do n't feel like i 'm ready for it yet . 
  maybe in a few years !, 
  i have not yet had the pleasure of visiting finland . 
  can we please stop with this johnson person ? 
  i came here to have a good time , and is feel so attacked right now . 
  if you fucking read the last thing i wrote , you could have enlighten yourself . 
  ** read mothafucka **, 
  please read the last text i wrote . 
  he better go to a barber before he talking shit . 
  the netherlands is of course the best place on earth !, 
  everyone knows that !, 
  ;-) i highly recommend the following cities : france * paris * marseille * monaco ( not french , but near france ) * avignon * nice germany * berlin * hannover * stuttgart * bremen poland * sopot/gdansk/gdynia ( all near each other ) * warsaw * krakow * zakopane italy * rome * florence greece * thessalonica * athens * sparta turkey * \u00c7anakkale ( seriously , go here ) * cyprus ( is of kebab clay ! ), 
  * troy spain * ibiza * madrid * barcelona austria * vienna * any mountain czech-republic * prague hungary * budapest p.s. 
  there are many more cities , but i 'm on holiday myself , and these are on the top of my head !, 
  wow , i never heard of this country . 
  how come i ca n't find any credible news articles about it ? 
  why is an american making us look bad , whilst if you 're not a christian in the u.s. you 're basically satan ? 
  can you give me some info about the place ? 
  i do n't know anything about it . 
  how is it not the same ? 
  taking land = taking land . 
  there 's just a different in methods . 
  i love britain and i 'd love to remain in the e.u. 
  i only wish it would stop complaining so much about it . 
  it 's not * that * bad . 
  sure not all things are perfect , and much improvement is needed , but we 're better off together . 
  and even from these polls , too many want to leave . 
  what about that referendum ? 
  yeah , but your pm is n't keen on the e.u. 
  either , and you people elected him . 
  he represent the people . 
  elaborate , please . 
  i do n't know what to google precisely , and do n't want too waste too much time on holiday , but i think the link below could satisfy you . 
  poland is n't even in the eurozone , you people use z\u0142oties . 
  why would you use the euro bank deposit ? 
  if i may ask . 
  yay , thanks for being such a nice human being !, 
  i love you too !, 
  if my country was being threatened , i would join the military . 
  you are making this sound less severe than it actually is . 
  i can do the same , you rather have greece , syria or the kurds took land from turkey `` to protect ethic people '' ? 
  against . 
  my apologies , i meant to phrase it as `` russia should be attacked , if they attack ukraine . '', 
  so we should mother russia do as she pleases ? 
  take land ? 
  defy treaties ? 
  invading with out good reasons ? 
  depends . 
  i personally think ukraine should be a full member of nato , and russia should be attacked . 
  it 's time they learn they can not simply attack countries `` to protect ethnic russians '' . 
  hitler did the same . 
  `` you '' is a referred to england . 
  i expected you ( now i do mean you , dear redditor ) to know that . 
  i hoped logic would be applied , but sadly i was wrong . 
  we have nato though , so most of the e.u. 
  would still be in touch with britain 's military . 
  no , but we certainly are benefitting from britain 's constant complaining . 
  instead of bringing up the problems , why not get all the ministers together and discuss it , come up with solutions ? 
  maybe it 's just dna to complain . 
  the weather , the e.u. , the euro , loss of empire etc. 
  i 'm sick and tired of basically calling the e.u. 
  shit , how it 's not working , that immigrants are overflowing , well , then you should n't have joined . 
  yay for britain . 
  defying the basic principles of the e.u. !, 
  i wonder when they will finally cut to chase , and leave the e.u. 
  well , i 'm not in charge of the e.u. , am i ? 
  well , nero was n't facing the russian federation at the time . 
  op , you were so cool when posting this , and now it 's ruined . 
  you know what , if britain wants to leave the e.u. 
  then do it . 
  we have no use for stupid twats that are making the union counterproductive , by critisising it or making us look bad . 
  if the british government is so keen on leaving , then have the goddamn guts to do so .
