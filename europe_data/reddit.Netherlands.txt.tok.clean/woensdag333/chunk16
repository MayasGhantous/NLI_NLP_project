  i remember one bar in lisboa 's bar street sold 0,5 l for $ 1 ( love you so much portugal ) , so it 's best to just let sagres control portuguese beer market . 
  also , i feel like it 's part of , at least lisboa 's culture . 
  with all the benfica love . 
  do n't know about the rest , as i 'm still to explore portugal further . 
  hmm , yes , the chocolate cup , refill and then eating it !, 
  best moment was when i was with the receptionist of my hostel ( lol ) , and went to a bar of her friend , great bar in centre of lisboa , but i had to cough , right when i was about to drink , so i spilled it all over my jacket . 
  then i hear some weird dutch , turned out the men were from south africa , so i made friends with them and they bought us like 6 chocolate cups !, 
  it 's only like 1,35 - but a very lovely gesture , so we ended up doing like shots the entire evening . 
  man , that drink fucks me up . 
  i was thinking of moving to portugal for a while before going to barcelona , because it 's very affordable . 
  then again , i was there in may , and my ears were burnt at 19 c , whilst the locals still had their winter coats on ... will never forget cascais , because from the great pizzeria there met a girl and got head in the mcdonalds bathroom . 
  first sexual experience ever , nvr forget, 
  hmm , maybe it 's because i was t actively looking for heineken , that i just missed it , since i was doing sagres research . 
  however , there is really good and affordable wine at pra\u00e7a de commerce as well . 
  i just like portugal . 
  it 's just so cute . 
  personally , i did n't like super bock , it 's nasty , but damn do i miss ginjinha !, 
  had a perfect little bar in lisboa !, 
  horrible name to pronounce for foreigners though , haha, 
  well , northern beers are fundamentally different from southern beers . 
  the reason being , i think , is the difference in weather . 
  for example , moritz , sagres and estrella are lovely beers , especially in the hot weather of iberia . 
  however , i do love heineken , brand , franziskaner and paulaner , but these beers are all produced way up north , and fit our weather here . 
  i did n't see that much heineken is lisboa , next to the heineken store at the airport , haha , most was still sagres . 
  it is * everywhere !, 
  * which is good , some good ol' patriotism . 
  yeah , i did research about sagres for a report , sadly never got a response , but still , it 's a national icon , as well as pretty much lisboa 's icon and its sponsorships and especially its history . 
  still , just because heineken owns the company , it does n't mean much . 
  it 's still being brewed in portugal , and still sold * everywhere * . 
  i miss it , it 's a good beer . 
  it 's still part of portuguese national identity , like heineken is in the netherlands , or moritz in barcelona . 
  you just got ta believe !, 
  sagres portuguese confirmed bless you , portugal, 
  bless that crazy-haired arian just kidding , minder !, 
  interesting . 
  i wonder what the outcome will be !, 
  [ soon , my reichtangle . 
  soon .

  we like to eat [ this ] ( http://www.lekkerensimpel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dsc_0419.jpg ) it 's delicious , unhealthy and all round ( unless we eat the stroopwafel as in the photo , off course ) . 
  spain ... * water * you doing, 
  pls no, 
  i think it would be good . 
  i mean , not many nations have ruled well under a lot autonomy . 
  personally , i 'm in favour of a union , but in times of need , a temporary dictator may be appointed . 
  i know this is ancient , as it is originally from the romans , but it worked out rather positive for them . 
  humans are still smart monkeys , no matter how advanced our technology is , and it will still work . 
  the glorious malta shines , finally !, 
  i 'm glad that italy is trying . 
  hope all gets well soon for my amicos !, 
  poland trying to get that personal union back up with lithuania, 
  nice , thanks . 
  i watched it in reddit , so i had n't clicked the youtube link . 
  it 'd be useful to do it in arabic too , and broadcast it repeatedly in refugee centres , because then they 'll remember and learn . 
  in fact , it should be broadcasted nationwide , in english , german and arabic so all can learn , not only those refugee camps . 
  i think all states should broadcast such a video daily . 
  the eu is always at the verge of collapse , according to the media, 
  gronings = / = east frisian, 
  and they have the polish one too ... 
  [ they do have it ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mvqshzf.png ), 
  earthquakes and catcafes, 
  does this mean ... * we * are the 1 % ? 
  we speak dutch in groningen too ... * \u00bf or do we not ... ? 
  just leave already . 
  this is just a waste of time , because there are more severe problems . 
  when the uk leaves , it 'll probably be like switzerland , with special agreements . 
  5/7 would happily live in italy, 
  first country names in every language , and now counties ' dialects ? 
  amico ftfy, 
  what the farmer does n't know , he does n't eat, 
  me too . 
  my uncle used to love him , but now he does n't anymore . 
  i ca n't remember the exact reason . 
  i remember that i was in turkey in the summer of 2014 , and sitting at the local cafe with my dede , and all of his friends gather there for tea , and they were plotting , what seemed like a revolution !, 
  each time a van with speakers promoting his campaign drove by they yelled at it ** angrily ** . 
  i do n't know why turkish , and also a lot of moroccans ( ??? ), 
  like him . 
  yet , their interests are with the newest sagging of jeans trend , dumb hats and not shaving for days which makes them look idiotic , rather than politics ... 
  i 'm half turkish , and i do n't like erdogan , but i have to be honest , the economy grew well under him . 
  although , i like atat\u00fcrk much more . 
  it might be , but you 're just complaining over nothing . 
  this makes no sense at all . 
  it 's just something to ignite a rant about . 
  the netherlands is governed very well . 
  i 'm ashamed of my country . 
  * independentismo intensifies *, 
  * clever girl *, 
  depends on what you 're looking for , i 'd say . 
  * independentismo intensifies *, 
  which institution makes these ? 
  i 've seen more of these , and i 'd like to see the website for their entire collection . 
  i have read that in germany , the film is very popular . 
  so you never now . 
  you could go to the cinema , or does it not play where you are ? 
  i like the one where spain is called `` espa\u00f1ol '', 
  omfg i 'm getting tired of this `` if you do n't listen to me , i 'll leave ! '', 
  like , leave motherfucker . 
  do it !, 
  i can already hear an epic voice like morgan freeman 's saying : * `` 8000 kilometers , 5 weeks . 
  '' * or samuel l. jackson : * `` 8000 mother % cking kilometers , 5 mothaf % cking weeks . '' * .
