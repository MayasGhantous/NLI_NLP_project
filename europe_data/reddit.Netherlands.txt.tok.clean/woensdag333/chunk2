  denmark , i love you , but you ai n't got nothing on us . 
  [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/oi0hn ) was on a quite tuesday noon in a city , having a place designed for 10.000 bikes on the central station only , with less than 200.000 habitants .

  there are many course in many countries which are ( primarily ) in english , but it depends on what culture and country you like . 
  do you like partying and cheap way of life ?

  i do n't understand why this would make it to the news . 
  is either that good or that bad ? 
  to me it seems quite good . 
  yup, 
  also in italy , right ? 
  i do n't understand how a trade agreement with countries as the u.s. and canada are bad .

  ** the red ** sunsets in a snowy winter are lovely !, 
  not a pole , but i have polish friends , and my best friend is one , but that is just the name of one in possession of a polish passport . 
  a good joke , i find and i came up with is : what kind of pole are you ? 
  they will look at you with confusion . 
  * north or south ? 
  but this is not one . 
  em , perhaps by telling you a site wants to collect data from you ?

  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cv8gixd.jpg?1 ) it 's not the nicest handwriting , but at least it 's better than some i have encountered . 
  my best friend has such a nice handwriting , it 's incredible !, 
  edit : [ here 's an example of her handwriting compared to mine . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0ntnmuo.jpg?1 ) i wrote the first two parts , the rest is hers . 
  i think i have some more sentences written by her here and there , but it is just so nice to see !, 
  i can not believe how beautiful she can write !,

  how do french people call a disaster on thursday ? 
  a * trajeudi *,

  i 've always sucked at statistics and maths in general , but when there are more people , is n't the chance of crime increased , even if the scale is the same ? 
  that just makes me sad as fuck . 
  there 's also a year between it , and does n't germany have roughly twice the population of poland ?
