  yeah !, 
  prostitution !, 
  i have one small red light district 100 m from my house and a bigger one in the city . 
  ah , i see my mistake , it 's `` urlaub '' or `` ferien '' , right ? 
  since the separation i consider it to be more of a second or third cousin . 
  ports in the other side of the world and opportunities to share/exploit our knowledge . 
  in my opinion , germany , austria and the netherlands are like brothers . 
  logically , since we 're all germanic countries , but germany and austria are the `` older '' brothers . 
  they are very similar to each other , from what i have noticed of personal experience . 
  the netherlands ' society is very different than our eastern and south-eastern friends ' , but i still love them most . 
  reasonably strong , but not well . 
  mostly because monies . 
  officially it 's a language . 
  a peculiar language , not spoken by many , but it 's horrendous to hear , in my opinion . 
  germany and austria feel the most like home , but it does n't mean i do n't love going to other countries . 
  yes . 
  groningers and frisians tend to dislike each other 's . 
  netherlands of relevant !, 
  definitely the weather . 
  is of happening !, 
  ai n't no frisian is going to rule my groningen !, 
  if someone is going to govern me , they should learn how to cover so i have 3g and service on my phone . 
  source : was in friesland last sunday , was horrible no internet , peculiar family , detours and they were n't even speaking dutch . 
  no , it can not , because russia wo n't co-operate . 
  a cliff . 
  rekt, 
  this was ... interesting, 
  russians sure know how to not be politically correct . 
  so earnings will not be earned when , for example italy and south-africa started trading ? 
  what ? 
  do you even english ? 
  express yourself more clearly . 
  plus that makes no sense at all . 
  it is much easier to have import/export if there is stability in a region , such as via trade . 
  because this is desirable , it is not a european duty . 
  it is an economic and political interest . 
  how is that not european interest ? 
  amen !, 
  it 's not because we dislike the u.s. it 's because it 's the only/best comparison , and lacks in important aspects compared , in my opinion . 
  tl ; dr on history/future : empires rise and fall . 
  alright you need to stop being a little bitch with complaining about the east . 
  everyone . 
  the greeks also conquered the middle-east up to india with only one defeat . 
  your argument is invalid . 
  d'accord . 
  the e.u. 
  's growth in gdp ( gross domestic product ) compared to these countries from 1960 till 2014 . 
  [ switzerland ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/european-union-gdp.png?s=europeanugdp&amp;d1=19600101&amp;d2=20141231&amp;url2=/switzerland/gdp-growth&amp;type=line&amp;title=european%20union%20gdp%20%7c%20%20switzerland%20gdp%20growth ) [ norway ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/european-union-gdp.png?s=europeanugdp&amp;d1=19600101&amp;d2=20141231&amp;url2=/norway/gdp-growth&amp;type=line&amp;title=european%20union%20gdp%20%7c%20%20norway%20gdp%20growth ) [ united states ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/european-union-gdp.png?s=europeanugdp&amp;d1=19600101&amp;d2=20141231&amp;url2=/united-states/gdp-growth&amp;type=line&amp;title=european%20union%20gdp%20%7c%20%20united%20states%20gdp%20growth ) [ china ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/european-union-gdp.png?s=europeanugdp&amp;d1=19600101&amp;d2=20141231&amp;url2=/china/gdp-growth&amp;type=line&amp;title=european%20union%20gdp%20%7c%20%20china%20gdp%20growth ) [ russia ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/european-union-gdp.png?s=europeanugdp&amp;d1=19600101&amp;d2=20141231&amp;url2=/russia/gdp-growth&amp;type=line&amp;title=european%20union%20gdp%20%7c%20%20russia%20gdp%20growth ), 
  this would actually be quite cool . 
  most of the soviet union 's leadership was just extremely poor quality . 
  that 's the result of eastern-europe 's infrastructure , economies ( before fall of u.s.s.r. ) , education , healthcare and so forth . 
  do you think the western countries like the cheap labour ? 
  well , organisations do , but the government and trade unions are not in favour of them . 
  mostly not of their nationality , but because they are cheap . 
  first of all , nie pi\u0119nkna usmiech . 
  :p second of all : [ graph of e.u. 
  's gdp growth from january 1960 to january 2013 . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/european-union/gdp ), 
  yes . 
  for the record , i am not `` giving '' sovereignty to brussels , i am giving up nothing much . 
  yes , maybe my government has to implement some things ordered by the e.u. 
  but i see not many problems . 
  how has it intended to make our lives worse ? 
  we have n't had a ( western-middle - ) european in 75 years , our economies grew , our quality of life took leaps in quality , there is healthcare , infrastructure , equality , unity and prosperity for me , my relatives and everyone 's future . 
  it has lead to the safety of many people and has brought democracy to the european theatre . 
  sure , i have some disagreements with the e.u. 
  but they do not mean i hate it . 
  i can not fathom your selfishness over the fact that perhaps slavic and balkan countries would have it worse ( they were worse off before the e.u. 
  ) , because if i have to give up a little sovereignty so that , what , 500 million people can enjoy prosperity , well , take the bloody sovereignty . 
  too bad . 
  i was getting happy that ukraine was finally receiving weaponry . 
  i 've only seen wales , england and the u.k. 
  i do n't know the flags and places of northern-england , but the one in the right lower corner is norther-ireland , if that is england or not . 
  i do n't know , because it 's too confusing . 
  if you hoover your mouse over a flag , not clicking it , the name of the place will show up . 
  cheers , enjoy it !, 
  :-) subreddits tend to have this , but not all of them . 
  for example / r/polandball has it , but another one does not . 
  my apologies , but i do not understand what you mean with `` thumbnail '' ? 
  do you mean the dutch flag , representing my nationality ? 
  if you want one yourself you can edit it in : * check the side bar . 
  * look below '' ... europeans '' * you 'll see your username , with the text : '' ( edit ) '' . 
  * click it , and choose the flag you want . 
  personally i do n't think it has a big effect on countries , but more on economies . 
  i do n't think it will hurt the economy too badly , but then again , i do not calculate these things or possess the knowledge to make credible estimations . 
  although , what i think is this : * england 's economy will see a smaller growth ( perhaps negative ) due to the loss of harbours , tax income and other effects on the british pounds . 
  yes . 
  two of my friends are kosovonian ( ? ), 
  and they have told me many things about it . 
  my friend 's family was the first to get electricity in the neighbourhood . 
  why i love the union ? 
  well : * economic growth . 
  * i can live in peace , without wars around the block . 
  * i can travel to the places i love with ease . 
  * opportunities for myself and my ( future ) family . 
  * human rights aplenty . 
  * i live in much safety . 
  what can i want more ? 
  * know exactly what place you want to go . 
  * save money .
