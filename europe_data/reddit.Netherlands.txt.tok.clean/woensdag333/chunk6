  should drop portugal , spain , portugal and france as well ? 
  i think they forgot to deduct the hours of siesta . 
  well , the person i am is a combination of how i am raised and what i am taught . 
  it 's that whole nature vs. nurture , but they are both important , i like our healthcare , because no hospital can refuse you . 
  you have to be treated , and the quality is excellent . 
  of course , there are minor issues , but the big picture is good . 
  partially , because you need the most basic form of insurance according to the law . 
  i like our king and queen . 
  their position is much more ceremonial , but i just like them . 
  they act much more like common folks than other or previous king and queens . 
  like , at last winter 's olympics they just ride their bikes from and to the stadia . 
  i like that . 
  german with romanian flag ? 
  becoming less independent on russia . 
  i have read that these two are the most obvious and worked upon options : * american gas rather than russian or middle-eastern . 
  * green energy, 
  i like to think that the income tax system is a bit harsh , but also fair . 
  i also like : * foreign minister frans timmerman * education * health care * infrastructure * privacy , net neutrality and copyright ( before brussels ' intervention ) laws * the king and the queen 's behaviour ( i find them to be closer to most of us ), 
  to be honest , british is rather compassionate , in my opinion . 
  in wwii they refused to have poland being attacked and would declare war if poland was under attack . 
  poland will be very glad to hear that !, 
  dutch woda and polish wodka is of many greatness !, 
  depends on the sausage . 
  i like dry meat sometimes , which i have never seen everywhere but in the netherlands . 
  italian meat is also great . 
  i forgot the name of it though ,, 
  my greek friend , at first took offence of that comment , but then she said : `` well ... 
  he 's pretty much right . '', 
  i love how the french and british still have that quarrel from their `` birth '' . 
  and how the french view themselves to be the most and the least arrogant is rather amusing as well . 
  germany is the best anyway , so it checks out . 
  why is this such a hot topic ? 
  [ here are many opinions . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2dpkg8/whats_wrong_with_a_federal_europe_your_opinions/ ) for me , i do n't know . 
  here , i 'll give a short elaboration : ** yes ** we stand as one !, 
  we are a united nation !, 
  we are not polish , greek or german !, 
  we are european !, 
  anyone is equal !, 
  equal pay check , coins , rights and benefits !, 
  we are all equal for lady justice and we have nothing to fear , but our progress !, 
  ** no ** this is utter shit !, 
  with a federalisation we lose our identity !, 
  our cultural heritage for which we have fought so long for !, 
  we have one government for 750 million people , but they ca n't decide what french , portuguese or dutch people value most !, 
  plus , if we want to change something it will never get talked about , because the big countries have much more to say and will only get their say !, 
  cheers , mate . 
  is that one paragraph all there is ? 
  but how is cheese in russian supposed to show that to me ? 
  i do not understand it . 
  is this supposed to amuse me ? 
  bruh, 
  i had that too in middle school , and at the time i was very good at it , but after i chose my course which had no geography classes at any time i simply forgot . 
  i also live in groningen and it actually has historic importance , because all the trade routes to and from germany ( and predecessors ) lead there . 
  all trade routes lead to groningen , eh !, 
  bugger off ya cheating whoofer !, 
  these fucking refugees need to stop complaining . 
  now i truly start to understand why the italian and spanish dislike them . 
  do n't complain , twats . 
  send them right back where they came from if they 're annoying as fuck . 
  if this was ranked on health care , britain would be # 1 . 
  pretty much sums up the netherlands , although groningen has always been much more important . 
  i do n't think u.k. 's economy would collapse , but canada has ** a lot ** of natural resources . 
  i ca n't do them all , but then again , i never really had geography classes , plus i have google maps . 
  pretty much , yes . 
  we both defeat our ancient old foe and all of world is finally dutch clay !, 
  hagelslag and cheese for everyone !, 
  i do n't know , mate . 
  i do n't know anything about moldova . 
  same . 
  i believe it 's somewhere south-east ? 
  near greece or so ? 
  all clay is of rightful netherlands !, 
  i do n't even know any places in moldova ... 
  poland can not into space , 
  everyone is so nice though . 
  they just let their wheels be free for anyone to get . 
  sharing is caring !, 
  how cycling actually works : * in scandinavia you ca n't ride a bike due to all the snow . 
  * in the nl , be , uk and de you ca n't cycle because of all the hard wind and rain . 
  * in the mediterranean countries you ca n't ride , because of horribly unsafe traffic . 
  * in balkan and slavic countries ca n't ride because wheels get stolen !, 
  ( had that happen once . ), 
  overall rating on cycling : 10/10 would do daily for rest of my life ... oh wait i already do . 
  this included both stereotypes and hands-on experiences . 
  yes , but i specifically mentioned the mediterranean to avoid those type of comments . 
  i think when it was adopted . 
  officially it became the anthem in 1932 , but no one favoured that sucky song . 
  everyone sung this , and has been the song that represents us for a long time . 
  is n't it kind off peculiar how from a lot of ( info ) graphs i have seen the mediterranean countries seem to be less `` productive '' in economic senses , but due to the combination of ... everything their lives seem to be much happier . 
  at least from a hand on experience . 
  in the mediterranean countries i , and many to those i have spoken , they are more relaxed due to the summer heat , and overall more relaxed . 
  which i like . 
  people also make wine there and drink quite something which , a few glasses of red is good for the heart , and the more relaxed approach to life leads in to quite an extended life , but whether it is better is subjective . 
  got ta love the italians though . 
  france is beautiful as well , but i love italia . 
  maffia is scary , but nicer than i expected . 
  i think so , because `` lui '' means both `` folks '' and `` lazy '' . 
  depending on the context of course . 
  mate .
