  how can you not love it ? 
  it 's not slow , it sounds merry . 
  it 's a feel-good song . 
  history is also old does that mean it does n't fit in our `` modern '' era ? 
  the song reflects how our nation was born and how our founding father was torn in which he should do . 
  honour the spaniards , or long live the dutch ?

  * altijd = always * verdreven = expelled * in godes vrees te leven = to live in fear of god * i do n't know the meaning of luyd , but in the wiki it translates to '' people '' . 
  yes , on vrees and onverveerd you are correct , i believe . 
  * altijd = always * verdreven = expelled * regeren = to reign, 
  yes , but after numeral attempts , i have concluded i can not speak old-dutch very well . 
  i have no idea how it would be pronounced . 
  nobody lists the oldest and most wonderful anthem :'( [ dutch anthem , * het wilhelmus * ( the william ) .

  you do realise that is the capital of argentina , right ? 
  bon appetite !, 
  we will make our return in the next winter olympic 's speed skating . 
  then we gon na win . 
  that some bullshit . 
  well played though . 
  wikipedia . 
  are you sure it is spelled correctly , because it looks like `` korsika '' which is german for the upper island near italia . 
  bruh, 
  depending on what nation we were we might have quite a few . 
  from french , spanish or german independence . 
  the current one we use is may 5th , * bevrijdingsdag * . 
  it is a day after * dodenherdenking * ( remembrance of the dead ) . 
  on that day we mourn all those who died in wwii . 
  too bad it was n't belgium ;-), 
  ** freedom ** * [ eagle screech ] *, 
  he sure did . 
  he knew when we fought the brits to help the u.s. emerge and were the first to officially recognise it . 
  [ watch this vid , plz ] ( http://nos.nl/video/627392-toespraak-obama-in-het-rijksmuseum.html ), 
  do you know why a belgian laughs three times about a joke ? 
  the first time is when he hears it , the second time is when it 's explained and the third time is when he finally gets it !, 
  we do n't need the anglos too much , although they are a help , we also have germany and other germanic countries . 
  they wo n't drop us , because we are important for their economies . 
  : * do you know why the dutch and the french make belgian jokes ? 
  because you are hilarious !, 
  if you want to chitter chatter with me , be quick before belgium ca n't support its citizens with energy . 
  yeet !, 
  yeet !, 
  yeet !, 
  might be made in the south , but improved in the north !, 
  of great netherlands will never fall into irrelevancy , because we are friends with the most important nations and are important for a lot of economies !, 
  yeet !, 
  [ mfw you think you are relevant ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yftfy.gif ) you 'd be speaking german , because germans take the highway through belgium to get to france . 
  it might be from flemish gold , but it was the great dutch who managed it , and also made the world 's first limited company with it !, 
  i 'm sorry , i ca n't hear you over our v.o.c. 
  and world trade . 
  you might be the first with the lion , but we were the first with the lion that mattered . 
  that is n't true at all ... 
  i do n't know about that , but i have read that chinese also bought pieces of land , not in china , but in places like europe where they build things , or grow crops . 
  i believe a balkan country that has a lot of eurozone tourists . 
  perhaps croatia . 
  some of us europeans might complain about how germany or merkel for that matter is a poor leader , but that 's bullshit . 
  she 's an amazing leader . 
  look at how germany is doing , compared to a lot of other e.u. 
  countries . 
  greece is actually making quite some progress , compared to the last few years . 
  it 's economy shrank only 0,2 % according to recent statistics , and because of fulfilling the changes the e.u. 
  demanded it can now receive a new set of loans for aid . 
  i do n't know how much and over what time span , but this was before the russian boycott . 
  even though , i assume and think that at it 's current way of business greece might see a growth late this year , or next year . 
  well , that 's the point . 
  it is about the nation . 
  the reason we depict ourselves as lions and in orange is because our founding father , william of orange , had a coat of arms with lions . 
  we use this as our national emblem and also in tons of other things , like the logo of the national football team .

  it may say `` belgicus ( actually belgicvs ) '' which is latin `` low lands '' . 
  hell to the no !, 
  a lion . 
  yes . 
  u ( you ) is polite . 
  uw ( your ) is also polite . 
  jij/je ( you ) is informal . 
  jouw ( surprisingly , yours ) is informal . 
  no , but i like to do it at turkish drivers sometimes , because traffic is horrendous there . 
  looking at you # 10 , # 35 and # 34 . 
  as simple and beneficial as it can be . 
  among other benefits are mineral recourses , energy , oil , agriculture and other natural recourses . 
  a wise man does not urinate against the wind . 
  it just sounds stupid , but it also makes so much sense . 
  due to the civil war people ca n't work , which means neither the people , companies and the government earn money . 
  ( foreign ) investors are afraid that whatever they invest gets destroyed due to the fact there is a war going on . 
  i would be ok of that . 
  i 'm actually hugely in favour of it . 
  football 2 . 
  rowing 3 . 
  ( field ) hockey do n't know for sure , but most people do those sports . 
  for the record , i support / u/daghesi in this thread . 
  damn . 
  you 're all way nicer to these people than me . 
  except for the new german toll . 
  that some bullshit . 
  you go merkel !, 
  no , do n't worry . 
  i 've only used it online and in a few conversation in real life , but only one knows what it means .
