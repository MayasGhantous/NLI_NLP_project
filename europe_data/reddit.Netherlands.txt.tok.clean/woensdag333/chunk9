  although when i heard it it was mostly from elderly people , because it 's a bit of a dated term . 
  i like that term better though . 
  i have this so far . 
  * my house in budapest * * my hidden treasure chest * * golden grand piano * * my beautiful castillo * * you * * you * * i 'd leave it all * it looks truly stunning !, 
  i have never heard of the first and last expressions , but after doing some research , i guess these : indian summer = nazomer ( after summer ) milky way = melkweg ( literal translation ) i do n't know what sun shower is supposed to mean , but the literal translation would be `` de zonnedouche '' i hope that helps . 
  my ukrainian sucks . 
  11 million is still 11 million . 
  for france every euro counts . 
  well , i think the e.u. 
  should do something to give aid , but france is in no position to do so . 
  they want to donate 11 million euros to palestine , but their economy is dragging the rest of the eurozone down . 
  they are not in a place to donate . 
  sorry , i do n't speak irish . 
  this post covers the same subject , and you might get some answers here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2dpkg8/whats_wrong_with_a_federal_europe_your_opinions/, 
  care to read ? 
  i did not claim that . 
  * sigh *, 
  so you agree , as a pole , that ther should be a new iron curtain , but now between your country and germany ? 
  on one hand i like the idea , and on the other i think it is a bad idea . 
  i 've discussed with someone who is really not in favour of this , but i do n't support him in any way . 
  i 'll quote the bugger ( he 's a bad , boring and peculiar one ) : `` i do not think the e.u. 
  should federalise itself . 
  we [ european union ] have done many bad things , like allowing countries as poland , or the whole of eastern - and mediterranean-europe for that matter !, 
  the best thing to do is to build a wall from the borders of germany and poland , down to austria , excluding italy , eastern-europe and france . 
  then we may be able to save this union . '', 
  however , the part of me that agrees with a federal europe says : `` yes , centralise the government !, 
  this is a good idea !, 
  now we are all equal , we share common foreign policy , economic policy and so forth !, 
  we become more united as a europe union , rather than polish , french and german ! '', 
  yet the part that disagrees with a federal europe is : `` no , no , no !, 
  we dutch do not share all interest , morals and ethics with polish people , or greek people !, 
  we want our culture to live on , and the german , british and everyone 's too !, 
  we have fought so many years to establish this , and now we must abandon it ? 
  why should we let one government decide what we want ? 
  they will give the one 's with the most population the first say !, 
  we will never be treated as first , because we lack the population for them to care ! '', 
  i never really took too much notice of the baltic states , but since reading up on them ( after i read about ukraine , prior to it 's current situation ) i have grown immense favour for them . 
  good job baltic states . 
  bless you . 
  damn . 
  those are a lot of apps for apple . 
  thanks mate !, 
  yet i do not know how . 
  is of many true !, 
  imf + eu = of many monies ask eastern poland . 
  even though the infrastructure in the east is quite broken , it also provides opportunity for construction and jobs in it . 
  just like in rotterdam or warsaw after wwii . 
  gorgeous !, 
  i wish i knew how to make time lapses !, 
  what ? 
  there are 12 stars , rather than 50 , and there are n't any stripes ... 
  i 'm sure those are lovely ladies , but i prefer the one i encountered in real life !, 
  this is a quite a good comic !, 
  does it matter ? 
  we should welcome our brothers and sisters with open arms !, 
  he was born in bonn . 
  hey , i have that as my background . 
  wow ... that 's quite a bad design . 
  i am quite pleased with our current flag . 
  by fat a great design !, 
  why do you have to ruin the moment ? 
  is beethoven outdated too ? 
  or chopin , vivaldi , bach , mozart ? 
  do people still find that `` texas is a country '' joke amusing ? 
  i completely agree !, 
  [ 15 miljoen mensen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8b_et-rfym ), 
  why ? 
  this is the right subreddit . 
  russia is being a bad boy right now , and is a country in/near europe , and is treating a european country badly . 
  stop being a baby . 
  still sounds good . 
  well , i meant the french music . 
  i made this list hastily , but i meant french music . 
  i do n't know many italian singers , or songs for that matter . 
  it was recommend by my italian friend , and i too was pleasantly surprised . 
  i 'll luck up luca later in the day . 
  cheers , mate !, 
  there are many songs , yet for some reason i ca n't come up with most of the names now . 
  i also do n't know every singer 's name . 
  italian : * jovannoti - a te * pavarotti - o sole mio * pavarotti - la donna \u00c8 mobile english : * pretty much anything . 
  you being shame to us . 
  this is not what we died for in the revolution . 
  haha , just blaze it guys . 
  well , city size does play a part in the level of education taught in it 's areas . 
  where i now live , there are universities , a lot more primary - and secondary schools . 
  i came from a small village ( ~ 5.000 ) where i did primary and secondary , but now that i live in a ( relatively ) large city ( ~ 200.000 ) there is a genuine difference in people 's intellect . 
  it is something you hear in public , when you talk to people and ... well ... it is visible on rankings of graduated students , school scores and so forth . 
  such a shame that greece is brought to its knees these days . 
  it especially saddens me after the fact that it it once was , the most important land in the world . 
  it brought the world many good , yet here it is , gasping for air in a room overflowed with water . 
  values ? 
  this graph shows the religious aspects . 
  the netherlands is of course the best place on earth !, 
  everyone knows that !, 
  ;-) i highly recommend the following cities : france * paris * marseille * monaco ( not french , but near france ) * avignon * nice germany * berlin * hannover * stuttgart * bremen poland * sopot/gdansk/gdynia ( all near each other ) * warsaw * krakow * zakopane italy * rome * florence greece * thessalonica * athens * sparta turkey * \u00c7anakkale ( seriously , go here ) * cyprus ( is of kebab clay ! ), 
  * troy spain * ibiza * madrid * barcelona austria * vienna * any mountain czech-republic * prague hungary * budapest p.s. 
  there are many more cities , but i 'm on holiday myself , and these are on the top of my head !, 
  oh , so you 're looking for advice on which cities to visit ? 
  if not , please elaborate , because it 's quite vague . 
  to be honest , americans are n't busy people , they just use the wrong approach , not the european one .
