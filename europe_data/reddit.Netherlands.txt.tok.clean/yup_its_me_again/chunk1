oh , great , thanks . 
  i was kinda hoping for something from the left field , like nyoosl haha, 
  newcastle as rhyming with hassle and newcastle as rhyming with parcel ( sans-r ) ? 
  i really appreciate the capitalization of the complete surname . 
  i once had to organize a conference and one of our speakers had a three-part turkish name . 
  for the booklet i needed last names and * luckily * she provided us with two upper case words . 
  besides the points made before , consider that juncker was put forward as commission president as the epp won as the biggest party . 
  this is unlike the us ( but similar to many other countries ) , where the legislature has no say in who become president . 
  our global rivals are china and india . 
  iran and russia come a few stairs behind . 
  europe needs to unite in order to remain a safe harbor for economic , social and religious freedom . 
  our foreign policy needs to focus on keeping these powers in check . 
  i believe an ever closer union would indeed be a way of achieving a stronger europe , but the political reality is that such a europe has very little chance of become reality right now . 
  the eu progresses by means of crises and we 'll have to face plenty to become a unified state . 
  the uk is on their way out and i feel no sympathy towards the english . 
  the only way to access our common market is by embracing its four fundamental freedoms ( goods , services , capital and people ) . 
  if they want to remain in the eu after all , we can not change the current treaties for an extra special uk deal , we can only integrate the uk more . 
  my foreign concerns lie with eu-integration , expanding the european sphere of influence westward and southward . 
  current diplomatic efforts are of course still important , but these are my priorities . 
  ### defense trump 's threats re . 
  nato mean the alliance is unreliable and a veritable threat for our eastern defense . 
  our security can only be guaranteed with a european army . 
  france , as the only nuclear power in the eu needs to play a formative role in our common defense . 
  eastern european countries are key in instilling russian fear in the entirety of the eu . 
  the uk has promised to block anything akin to a european coordinated military force , so this takes at least 3 years before any progress 'll be made . 
  ### expansion of the eu and trade in europe 1 . 
  the remaining balkan countries should eventually become eu members . 
  georgia , azerbaijan , armenia are already eurovision participants , they need closer ties with the eu . 
  especially georgia is tricky rn with their russian war , but some deal in the eclectic mix of european partnerships , treaties and associations would be helpful to gain a foothold in the middle east . 
  ukraine is already choosing for europe , we need to reciprocate their loyalty . 
  we 'll see how it goes with the recent association treaty . 
  europe needs to stand strong to russian bullying by keeping the sanction in place . 
  i think south america should be a priority : as they start to come together ( [ unasur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_south_american_nations ) ) , we should become strong partners . 
  we have a strong cultural connection ( colonial , i know ) and we need to strengthen our economic and political ties . 
  their economies have ample opportunity for growth and their lack of enthusiasm for american ties , we have a shot of become each other 's allies . 
  we are 25 % bigger in terms of population , but their economy ( gdp ) is just 30 % of ours . 
  we can broker a trade deal . 
  the second area would be the mediterranean . 
  their economies are meh . 
  we have a lot of high-educated immigrants with a north-african/middle-east background , let 's put them to use to stimulate growth in north africa and the middle-east . 
  this also requires a firm hand towards israel and palestine , where current provocations will not help peace . 
  i have no idea how to effectuate this though . 
  better economies in this part of africa helps mitigate economic migration and helps our security . 
  we are 165 % bigger than north-africa in terms of population , their economy ( gdp ) is 5 % of ours . 
  sub-saharan africa is getting back rubs by china and india . 
  as the continent that will define the 21st century , extending ties to this area is important to keep it in check and inside the european sphere of influence . 
  this is where we can use the help of south america , that is close by geographically and can come to our aid when our colonial pasts prevent constructive politics in the region . 
  it is yuge though -- in population and size -- , so i feel our connections are necessarily a lot weaker than with south america . 
  ### the rest of the western world ** canada ** , although i feel that ceta has not been the agreement i was hoping for with regards to its contents , its geopolitical meaning nevertheless is very important . 
  it affirms europe 's and canada 's cultural ties by making it -- some sort of -- a trading bloc . 
  with european power fading on the geopolitical stage , we need to grow our influence to stay key players . 
  ** japan , australia , nz , korea ** : i think europe 's influence can not be really well exerted in asia . 
  these western countries need to do that themselves . 
  i do n't feel we need to become bigger buddies than we already are . 
  the uk and the us will eventually pass around and rejoin the sane part of the world . 
   why will the locals want the eu then ? 
  because we want the country to be poor for 10th years eu membership ? 
  your point does n't make sense . 
  i do n't think you are actually open for discussion ; if you were you could have seen from the other responses that the eu provides more than poor immigrants moving in . 
  i think you overestimate the amount of immigrants voting in such polls, 
  not op , but it sounds like for a country with subdivisions with different interests , differentiated devolution is already in place that caters to their different interests . 
  ideal , no ve ? 
  great idea . 
  i suppose i nominate gchq for an advisory member position , for the children of course . 
  i 'm very concerned with our children . 
  what about raising taxes so corporations pay their share ? 
  what the fuck is up with that headline ? 
  i can not parse it . 
  the greek word for greece is ellas, 
  so its a full on geodefault . 
  and \u215b of all redditor come from continental europe ? 
  and yet , i 'm happy they 're there . 
  when you look at isis and them smashing old artifacts because they 're no islam or wrong islam , i 'm glad this stuff is safe in a stable , western country . 
  most information rights , just as the rights of free speech and so on , only apply between you and the state . 
  private companies like google are n't bound to that . 
  at least its better than busses and trams of europe . 
  i like that within minutes there 's a pretty strong draft, 
  russians call homos ` pederasts ' , so child molesters actually . 
  that 's what that comment is all about, 
  well , i guess maa is for land so you just have to explain prantsus . 
  languages that do n't have an f ( or p ) substitute p ( or f ; compare philippines , pilipinas ; philistine , palestine ) : so then you have france -  prantsus, 
  i love the tumblr 's name, 
  no , because ttip will bow to the lowest common denominator, 
  i would n't say podemos is anti eu, 
  love it, 
  the digital single market is one of the main targets for this commission , so i really hope it 'll be a good one . 
  no not really . 
  but the commission is working on new legislation for copyright , so that content distribution is also easier than it is now . 
  that 's what the copyright initiative is trying to solve , the licensing issue . 
  there live over half a billion people in the eu . 
  the eu as a whole has the biggest gdp of any country . 
  that 's a market you ca n't ignore , the risk of competitors gaining ground is too big . 
  ianal , but i read in this thread that the proposed legislation is a directive . 
  directives are minimal standards that the national governments then have to impel enemy in their own code of law . 
  dutch net neutrality then would be safe , as most likely , the directive is already implemented in nl,
