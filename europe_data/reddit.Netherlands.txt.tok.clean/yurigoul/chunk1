or cutting down the social programs in order to afford all this which is the thing i hate the most about the eu and their neoliberal crap , so if he does that : good for him, 
  does she do homeschooling these days ? 
  just make like 10 accounts and you are never alone :-), 
  i do n't doubt your sincerity , i 'm just torn by this . 
  lets just say i will not join a chorus , mkay ? 
  probably . 
  no guarantees for future drunk me . 
  but i also never watch soccer games . 
  with the ` murrica ' people , i 'm not so sure . 
  and i 'm living in germany where information about left wing people is gathered ( maybe recently they started it about right-wing people as well ) and a president openly stated that it is not a good idea when one of the german-sub-states gets a left wing vice president ? 
  or because in my mind it points towards creating an artificial identity that feels almost fascist ? 
  or at least it seems like brainless brawling infused by lots of boos - and people who do not share or want to share that identity are closed out or worse ? 
  i think / u/howie _ the_lord means that we do not want to copy the ` murrica ' kind of behavior, 
  i do hope that that one does not catch on . 
  source ? 
   if you 're caught on the street either ** drunk ** or late wait , for a moment i thought they were russian fanboys ... 
  no adblock , only ghostery . 
  i do n't like ads , but somehow i am also curious to find out what will come next . 
  now spam , that is another matter - but i have to add that those spam messages where they are trying to sell you dog food is a whole level up from what it used to be :-), 
  ah , not with me ( i refreshed a couple of times to be sure ) - so it probably works that way for people with gold . 
  i noticed there are no ads . 
  but with reddit gold you get an option in your settings to block out these ads , i do not think that link is used then , or is it ? 
  i do not block ads because of the nice way reddit does ads , but when testing it i do not remember being linked to a different address . 
  this just shows reddit ... why does this link exist ? 
  it takes a long time to completely overwrite a hdd with random data - with a quick wipe only the data-tables are erased . 
  the other option could be a strong magnet , but do not know enough about it . 
  will there ever be a bill of rights as in a contract between the european people and the european union ? 
  the thing that was sold us as being one ( in the netherlands at least ) was more a list of the economic principles - and i did not like them one bit . 
  and at the same time it made me fear the european union because it looks as if there is no direct contact with the people whose lives they are influencing by those economic principles . 
  on top of that i think it is strange to create a union that is based on principles that i would call philosophical in nature . 
  with any other government you get to vote on the person whose philosophy you like most , and even though you can vote for the european representatives , it seems as if that is of no influence on the philosophy tsince it is already adopted . 
  to me it is ok to have some principles that are very hard to change - but those principles should be about the way we are governed and how we are represented and the rights/obligations we have , not about the things having to do with economics . 
  notions about economics change all the time , and this is reflected in political programs . 
  well , what can i say but :  this video contains content from top channel , who has blocked it on copyright grounds and i 'm in germany for crying out loud . 
  i believe someone from the alternative sub claimed it and was planning to create a redirect . 
  and yes , they did , but they redirected / r/xkcdcomic to / r/xkcd, 
  i was aware of the xkcd situation , did not know how big it really was . 
  ah , i knew abut that one because of xkcd - good to hear that he is gone there . 
  i do n't blame you : starting a european reddit is als not my top priority . 
  i 've been waiting 7 years for that ... but to be fair : at first it was not that important , but with the growing numbers there is more and more ignorance that there are people who do things differently and that ` we ' not necessarily includes me and that ` our president ' might be a bit strange since i do not have one . 
  nope , not just you . 
  the software is open source ... 
  backstory + care to comment on / u/furgles 's comment ? 
  i do n't believe mr. karl habsburg really is a pretender ( and i heard there are strict rules in the austrian press never to mention him as being a potential ruler , not even a joke is allowed ) but if he was , as a habsburger , he would be the kaizer not only of austria , but of the whole of europe . 
  as an austrian friend once said : ` all this was once austria . ', 
  ( yes , and spain , if you want be precise ), 
  that 's kinda sad is n't it ? 
  you work for your country for an intelligence agency all your life and the only people willing to publish your writings are loons ? 
  or maybe it is part of the profile when they hire you ? 
  i can not comment on the trustworthiness of the blog , but i take your word for it . 
  however , i found it an interesting letter and started wondering about the source and if it is what it claims it is . 
  what i found is that it was not only published there , it was published on several forums and whatnot .

  is that any better ? 
  sorry , i 'm a bit too drowsy to do some real research ( anti-biotics kinda make you stoned ) edit : with advertisements with titles like * america 's stolen narrative * my spidey sense starts tingling , or maybe i do not understand america much . 
  and how near are you to germany ? 
  and why does this matter on the european scale ? 
   reddit is like 2 kids arguing ... 
  that people even think it is ok to abuse their power in such a way to drive their own agenda . 
  fuck them in the most horrible way . 
  look at world history - take bhopal for instance , an incident that not even merited an official apology - and then say fuck 'm . 
  they think they can discredit people who are honestly worried about something that could harm us all and our children 's children . 
  and they think it is ok to use such tactics to just put them in a bad light , only because they have to change their way of life and lose a lot of money ? 
  edit : i 'm not christian , but this is what the bible talks about on many places ( about rich people , greed , etc ) and those people really deserve hell for even trying to pull something like this . 
  well , fuck them . 
  i hope they die in some fucked up chemical accident that environmentalist groups tried to warn everybody about.or better yet : something that leaves them crippled for life in a fucked up way . 
  aw come on , you wanted to be famous for your women and apparently you are for your paprika ( but we 'll remember you for your goulash anyway ) . 
  ow yeah , sorry i forgot about what is happening on the east side of where i am now : you could easily make a good second place , and i would understand it if people said you were number one instead . 
  as a dutch guy living in germany : mark my words - this is a battle you are going to lose . 
  they invented the european highway , but still can not find one if they need one - apparently . 
  ok i understand now . 
  it is more or less the same reasoning behind / r/awwschwitz : you have to realize those people were human otherwise you would only see what they did as ` only monsters do such things ' . 
  but that said : to me it needed an explanation ... 
  i think most pizza-joints are turkish as well here in berlin . 
   otherwise you can recommend the latest wolfenstein-game or perhaps neonazi-propaganda . 
  that 's a bit rude - especially the last bit - would n't you think ? 
  all the links are gone now - removed for violence . 
  anybody has a different link ? 
  liveleak or something ? 
  it is not much and you can not behave like a true consumer , but that is about it . 
  but this is mostly dependant on the amount you spend on housing . 
  you do n't have a family to take care of . 
  now try to pay the rent and organize food and go on a holliday with mom , dad and the little one ( s ), 
  so , now we wait until one of these cute ladyboys win ? 
  neither do i - [ here is another one ] ( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/motorcycle-trousers-pants-new-men-s-leather-pants-gay-leather-uniform-breeches-/360611540681 ) - it seems to come from the design for pants traditionally worn when riding a horse . 
  do n't ask me why , it should have a reason . 
  ow that , it has to do with the leather pants , is something worn by us ( ? ), 
  policemen on motorcycles .

  well , that is how i started to talk german . 
  and english . 
  i can not remember it , but it is probably how i started to talk , period !,
