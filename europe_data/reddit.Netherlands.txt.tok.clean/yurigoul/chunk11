  that was after they learned how to defeat the dutch, 
  as a subscriber , i was indeed confused when i found this on my frontpage . 
  used heroin a couple of times over the years , can confirm . 
  the funny thing is that i first read about it on slashdot - and that is a first for such an important ruling with wide ranging consequences , usually i see these stories on reddit first since a couple of years . 
  a pirate bay like site is no longer possible with this ruling since the ruling means linking to copyrighted material with intent of gain ( monetary or otherwise ) is a no go . 
  this also means that i will no longer be eaten by predators , amiright ? 
  well thank you , i always wanted to visit tigers up close . 
  can someone please remove this comment - it goes agains the circlejerk and the woosh is simply too strong . 
  donald trump also wants to build a wall ... 
  https://what-if.xkcd.com/54/ for the follow up, 
  a step further , does this also mean that this reactor could pave the way to the lftrs because certain principles are better understood ? 
  and thanks for the answer :-), 
  having a switch versus have that switch being triggered by software layered on top of an os , on top of what the processor using as instruction language - or that is what i think is the difference, 
  how does it compare to a [ thorium reactor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thorium-based_nuclear_power ) ? 
  in the wiki page it also says it is a breeder reactor and i have always been told that thorium is way less dangerous and less problematic in the long run ( less waste , shorter half life ) . 
  that seems also to be the case with the fast neutron reactor . 
  or is that the same thing ? 
  after his resurrection , you mean ? 
  the first zombie overlord of germany ? 
  not what i heard from many people from belgium . 
  one even refuses to speak it because the other language speakers treat her like shit because she is not perfect enough . 
  source : work in an environment where there are dutch and belgians - both french speaking and dutch speaking . 
  my point was that most belgians can understand the other language but not speak it , so ... 
  most of them can understand it just fine , but because of the language struggle/war they refuse to speak it - thereby denying themselves extra possibilities and more braincells ( since speaking multiple languages is often seen as a cause of higher brain function ) . 
  belgium is not bilingual as most people think , but is officially trilingual : french , dutch and german . 
  french and english are the most important for the work , the other two might be a prerequisite by the belgium government . 
  belgium is still part dutch speaking ( and part german ) and officially brussels is bilingual . 
  of course they rather cut each others throat , but that is another matter . 
  that was considered progress back then . 
  [ well , we have had our problems , and then we are not talking about our religious wars ] ( http://unusualplaces.org/graves-of-a-catholic-woman-and-her-protestant-husband-2/ ), 
  title gore :  #victim of murder perhaps hunted down by the family ? 
  would be a better translation, 
   turkey + isis against the pkk ftfy they are just fine - thank you for asking, 
  according to the link u/vinnl provided this is not the complete story and this newspaper has chosen not to write that she has her own lawyer - and that is why she did not accept the ones the nl gov suggested . 
  this very typical for this newspaper - it is more interested in saucy news and gladly manipulates the facts . 
  you can therefor not tell what else they choose to present in a different way . 
  there was just the question if it was true - nothing more . 
  [ they paid to various parties and countries and people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_reparations_for_world_war_ii ) , they also [ apologized again and again ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8q8vm8a8xc ) and made it [ illegal to deny that it has happened ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial ) . 
  you could of course have the opinion that it was not enough . 
  genocide on ** polish soil ** : recognized genocide in which ** polish people on polish soil ** played a part : not recognized note : including poland adds a whole new level of complicated in this context . 
  edit : added ` on polish soil ' in the second line, 
  the yellow one, 
  thank you !, 
  that explains a lot :-), 
  but what are the grounds for appeal ? 
  yes but what would cause the verdict to be too prudent ? 
  could it still have been the butler who hid the murder weapon in the freezer ? 
  are there consequences for future verdicts and could innocent people land in jail ? 
  does this mean belgium is now responsible for all crime and all criminals world wide even if they are not belgian citizens ? 
  these are all bogus reasons , but it is my point : i want to know why . 
  ` tea or death ' it is then, 
  in many murder cases - especially the most prominent ones - they tend to keep certain aspects a secret . 
  this is done to weed out the attention seekers , the ones confessing to a crime they did not commit . 
  since there is no evidence of a body , is there even a murder ? 
  but in this case - as far as i came to understand from reddit - this is not about the murder yet , but the member of a terrorist organization part . 
  but even that can be faked , of course . 
   based on judicial procedures yes , but why ? 
  this does not tell me anything . 
  what procedures ? 
  is there a certain consequence for future rulings ? 
  does this have hidden consequences ? 
  yes !, 
   if you do n't like it then use a proxy '' . 
  splashy pants is all tears right now - how could you be so mean ? 
  another one that uses strong language in the hope people get confused by it . 
  social democracy is what the name says : a democratic party with emphasis on social topics . 
  do not get confused by misinformation . 
  and no : this not for the pp i am replying to , this is aimed at those who might get confused, 
  i 'm already cumming for the fifth time , thanks for asking, 
  ow , i see , you think by posting this you give the impression i did not . 
  sorry , you are the only one that thinks that since i have given the links with the numbers . 
  you on the other hand need a brigade so you can down vote opinions you do not like . 
  bye bye now .

  you are literally repeating a lie from the mccarthy era or so , in order to show your superiority on a forum in the year 2017 ? 
  are you sure you want to do that ? 
  it is almost as bad as the `` national socialism is socialism '' thing coming from the thirties of last century . 
  another fascist - ow gosh , have to do my nails yet again . 
  here are the facts from another post of mine : [ fl\u00fcchtlingsfeindliche angriffe in der bundesrepublik deutschland / attacks and offenses against refugees in germany ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/fl%c3%bcchtlingsfeindliche_angriffe_in_der_bundesrepublik_deutschland ) the second column is the attacks on asylums - gone up to over a thousand in 2015 - [ numbers for 2015 ] ( https://www.bka.de/en/currentinformation/policecrimestatistics/2015/pcs2015.html;jsessionid=ce494ecd7be7f5c133821bdce8fe1b7a.live2291?nn=39580 ) coming from official center of police crime statistics - [ quoted here for 2015 ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/news/panorama/kriminalitaet-bka-chef-warnt-vor-gefahr-neuer-rechter-terrorzellen-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-160625-99-447306 ) with a warning about possible terror attacks from the extreme right .

  something nasty , fake news - you know the drill . 
  another fucking fascist on reddit ? 
  hard to believe it . 
  tss , time to do my nails again, 
  you could sue them - but i doubt much burning will be done . 
  asylums for refugees on he other hand are burned down by the hundreds . 
  but he was only threatening to do it , you can just qualify this as hate speech - which is pretty normal for a politician , they get convicted for that left and right all the time . 
  indeed - search ` the great game ' on wikipedia, 
  71 charges/convictions total over the last 15 years . 
  the charges include soliciting to have sex with 14 year old girls , selling drugs to minors and violence/illegal weapons to only a couple of mentions of hate speech . 
  you were saying ? 
  or do you want to continue downplaying it ? 
  ow yeah , or [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzk0cbrhs9i ) , or simply go to / r/the _ schulz, 
  there is only one true gottkanzler !, 
  of course you react like that , keep on following the instructions you have been given . 
  i do not take your word for any of it . 
  the last thing i got from a fascist on facebook after i gave him the link that says the sweden massacre was just a lie , was some link saying that even though trump overreacted it was still going down the drain in sweden . 
  as far as i 'm concerned all the people here with their anti-sweden bs are merely shills .
