  so ... if that is true , i am curious to find out how norway will reply to that . 
  so ... they are suggesting the israelis did it ? 
  the article mentions violence in recent years . 
  when was the decapitation video ? 
  long before that i have seen and heard of videos of russians nazis in combat training mixed with videos where they were beating up foreigners . 
  i think this is going on for a longer time than just a couple of years . 
  edit : the russian decapitation video was shot early august 2007 . 
  i would say it is going on for at least 5 years or longer . 
  he , do n't come knocking on my door for that , it is an opinion ... of sorts ... and one that is aired regulary , so ... go complain to the pp, 
  to the downvoters : you should only downvote things that are irrelevant and/or do not add to the discussion . 
  i do not have the same opinion as the pp , but he is doing exacty what the op asked for : giving an honest answer to the question . 
  downvotes are therefore against reddiquette . 
  tl ; dr : the op asked for a discussion : here it is !, 
  in short : we just have to try harder . 
  dude , even germany wants to get rid of it . 
  because , you know , if things go bad , things could go boom - among other things . 
  compared to the netherlands the german system is very expensive . 
  in some cases - when you are a freelancer or have your own company - you need to have private insurance . 
  there are very cheap ones but if you are older or already have a disability or some chronic illness you are screwed , since they can refuse to take you aboard . 
  what i did like is the ksk or ` k\u00fcnstler sozial kasse ' = insurance for artists , but also covers freelance journalism , composers , performing artists , designers etc. 
  you pay a price based on income . 
  the netherlands here : last time i was insured there ( 2007 ) everybody payed around 90-100 eur for basic coverage and you could add extra coverage for around 30-40 eur for things like extra dental care etc. 
  there is no difference between private and public . 
  on top of that you pay a percentage of your income ( around 6 % ) . 
  everyone has to be accepted for at least the basic coverage . 
  dunno about the extra insurances . 
  most things are free , some up to a point and some cost extra money ( but nowhere near what it actually costs ) , but you need a prescription for a lot of things ( seeing a specialst for instance ) . 
   what are these things ? 
  i 'm willing to gamble that they 're not going to be covered by any reading comprehension class . 
  there are 55 countries on this world that have english as at least one of their official languages . 
  therefor i have 2 questions for you : ** a ** - could you clarify what grammar/spelling system you were using ? 
  ** b ** - could you prove beyond a reasonable doubt the people here were in a country that uses that system or a system used in any of the other 55 countries while this was discussed ? 
  ( think about the jamaican english with he-man and i-man for example . ), 
  a lot of people here only speak english because you do , so be polite to us please . 
  and get used to the fact that the english used on the internet will change as dramatically as it changed during the colonization of america in the next 50 years or so , all because the internet forces millions and millions of non-native speakers to use it . 
  it is our language now . 
  we are more people than you are . 
  it is our language now !, 
  in my opinion that what you wrote is uncalled for . 
  grammar nazi-ing seems to be nothing more than a shitty at hominem in this case . 
  if you are talking about a star trek reference , then yeah . 
  but i think people do think this is not contributing to the discussion . 
  maybe also because there are more of them ? 
  then it easier to create your own society within another society . 
  at least that is how i see it here in berlin . 
  a small - and maybe unrelated - example : i am dutch , living in berlin , there are not that many dutch people around here so it is harder to find my own and stick with that - so to speak . 
  ( on the other hand : i was not looking for them either , because i wanted to learn the language and live here etc ), 
  in my version in paradise the cops are english and the lovers italian . 
  well , you know what hell is then . 
  here you can get your flag : http://www.reddit.com/elxyi, 
   i would be surprised if anything can ever have the same impact as shakespeare had , because there is such an astonishing amount of ` noise ' around . 
  the big difference 15th century england and 21st century world is : - in shakespeare 's time communication was less and slower . 
  you could even - in theory - read all the books that were known in that time - in our time communication is more , but faster . 
  people will process more information than there were books in shakespeare 's time . 
  based on that it should be possible to have a new shakespeare in our midst and eventually find out about it since we are all processing so much more information . 
  another thing is that there are shakespeares all around us all the time - but not all of them invented as many words as he did . 
  we are both dutch so i can come up with two or three examples from our language : - maarten toonder from o. bommel fame , invented the word ` denkraam ' . 
  and there were other words as well . 
  - koot en de bie invented several words and sayings , but can not recall any directly from memory . 
  - commercials are of big influence on our language ( dutch ) . 
  ` helaas pindakaas ' for instance . 
  same goes for movies in an international setting . 
  ` i 'll be back ' is laden with meaning it would not have had without the movie . 
   but if an experienced mechanic tinkers with my engine , ( s ) he can probably make it run faster and smoother than i would have been able to do ever . 
  a mechanic is someone who is specialized in using tools almost no one else uses on a daily basis . 
  since ware all able to speak , and we are all human beings with brains that are made to distinguish patterns and therefor understand language and also use language , we therefor are all mechanics . 
  language is an instrument ruled by democratic forces . 
  shakespeare made his joke about ` copulating peasants ' , but if nobody had understood what he meant it would have gone nowhere . 
  ( and if shakespeare had been a klingon he would of course have had no influence at all - / nerdy joke alert ) there might be people who are better at using language than others , but i resent the idea you have to be able to understand hermetic poetry first before you are licensed to tinker with it . 
  kids do it all the time , it might even be seen as the way they come to master the language - and therefor learn to be socially active , learn to be members of our language/sign based culture . 
  learning and playing helps young brains develop into grown up brains . 
  the american brand of english was not developed by shakespeares , it was developed by poor people , refugees , mostly coming from non-english speaking countries . 
  because of the dutch influence , the word yankee was added ( jan-kees , a dutch name ) , the german influence added the word ` dollar ' ( thaler , the region were silver was found ) . 
  i could go on , but have to go to work . 
  greetings from a cold and grey berlin , and thank god for coffee . 
  i think my english is very american since i never really learned it in school , because i never finished it ( but got into university later with a ` colloquium doctum ' ) . 
  from there on it is a story about mtv ( when it still broadcasted music ) , movies , books , american friends , university ( most books were by americans ) , slashdot and later reddit . 
  so my english is mostly a mish-mash of different brands of english , and i plan to keep it that way . 
  i also think one should do its best to write as clearly as possible , and i usually only get pissed at people who correct other people , when it is very clear to me and others what they meant . 
  but there is another thing : language is a living being that develops and changes all the time . 
  language has never been bound by so many rules as it is today . 
  because meaning changes all the time , as does grammar , etc. 
  it should not be stopped by stupid conservatism . 
  without shakespeare ` to copulate ' would not mean what it does today . 
  do we have shakespeares around here ? 
  or maybe : not yet . 
  it might be that creating a persona here - or anywhere else on the internet - could develop into the same thing as writing theatre 500 years ago . 
  instead of writing for actors you are the actor . 
  then bozarking - and many , many others before him - could have been a sign of things to come . 
  trolling as an art form ? 
  i really want to use the phrase ' i almost had a pregnant ' irl one day , i just did not have the chance yet . 
  but my guess is that using ` it is probably something silly and non-sexual ' is taking it too far . 
  that is more something of an inside joke . 
  it is a difficult thing because i also try to be as correct as possible . 
  though there are certain things - like certain grammatical constructs - i simply ignore , or am not capable of using/understanding ( the two go hand in hand most of the time when using another language ) . 
  but i can also not deny that language is in constant development , and who am i to judge what mistakes are actually a sign of something new ? 
  anyway , the other side of the coin is that there are also people who have the attitude of being holier than everybody else , and somehow for me it is easier to cope with stupidity than with that - but that is a personal matter . 
  mostly they reply in a sms/irc speak sentence to show how stupid english can be at some point in the discussion that follows . 
  but indeed , i make mistakes . 
  but i also do so when writing dutch .
