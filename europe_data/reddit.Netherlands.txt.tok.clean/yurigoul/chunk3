  but for how long ? 
  and if i ( a dutch citizen ) work in germany for the next 20 years and am ready to get a pension - which will probably not be enough - will they throw me out after a couple of years , even after i have lived there for like 30 years ? 
  edit : lived and worked there for 30 years , i have been living and working here for a while, 
  my condolences, 
  but even then the end of january/the beginning of february are colder . 
  usually . 
  edit : for full disclosure - i have been living in berlin the last 7 years but i also remember this trend from the 43 years i have been living in the mother country . 
  wait for it . 
  usually it starts to get colder at the end of january/beginning of february . 
  you know what ? 
  i decided against learning one of the southern languages because when it is hot i can not do or say anything anymore , but when it is cold i hate it too , but at least i have the energy to curse the weather and after that i just move on . 
  so what good would learning spanish or italian bring me ? 
  i might start learning one of the scandinavian languages or something instead . 
  that one will never change , probably . 
  i only have the impression the dutch are not the dutch anymore in that respect - or not really . 
  but i have not been in the motherland for quite some time - so i might be mistaken . 
  i like that kind of tolerance in a religion . 
  she is not jewish ... 
  i 'm not sure ... would that mean that she was already damned ? 
  hell ... is that even a thing with jewish people ? 
  when my mother was a little girl she got payed to make a fire in the stove on sabbath so the food would get warm . 
  well , it seems i did know what a profit means . 
  not being allowed to make a profit in this case means : not having an incentive to fuck with peoples lives . 
  enlighten me oh wise one . 
  i met a french guy who learned german and english by simply visiting the country , but he said he tried to do the same with dutch , but failed - exactly for this reason . 
  but that said : i am in berlin for 7 years now and i notice there is a group of people who go by for years and years with only english , but they tend to get isolated somehow since not everybody speaks english ( especially the people from the former east ) . 
  yes , you can join the party-scene and the art-scene ( somehow ) and be the perfect hipster when using only english , but for the resit it might be difficult . 
  the only jobs you will probably have are in the party scene or in a call center speaking your own language . 
  not speaking the language of the country can create a bubble , a filter that isolates you from many areas . 
  6.1 - but i really thought i failed it since i had to take a guess a lot of the times, 
  / r/anormaldayinrussia would probably love these . 
  but you should agree that they are a pretty good reaction to something that would have been way , way worse .

  if that is the case , then the netherlands has mountains too . 
  germany is very concerned with privacy since they fucked up big time in the past in that regard . 
  thank you for chiming in . 
  question : must one ` of ' be an ` or ' in the last sentence ? 
  something like :  therefore the validity of a community measure or its effect within a member state can not be affected by allegations that it runs counter to either fundamental rights as formulated by the constitution of that state ** or ** the principles of its constitutional structure . 
  either way , it makes sense in order to force all member states to do adhere to the same standards . 
  but somehow it also gives me an uneasy feeling since there is afaik no alternative to a constitution at a european level ( as in a contract between state and its people ) . 
  i 'm wondering what the european union can say about something that is expressed in the constitution of a member country since there is no equivalent on a european level . 
  i 'm no expert but if there is a local law y that is challenged by a european law x then i suspect that european law wins . 
  with stuff at the constitution level it could be a different thing . 
  but maybe there is an expert in the audience who could enlighten us . 
  edit : europe is forcing suppliers to adhere to a common standard for charging a mobile phone/similar gadgets . 
  no way one of the members could say ` do whatever you want ' to suppliers . 
  do n't forget that that the industry also needs water in big quantities . 
  in most european countries the health-care is state-organized , since multiple insurance companies are allowed to operate in that market, 
  a constitution should be a contract between the people and the state . 
  part of the contract could be that the state has to guarantee that no profit is made with necessities of life , for instance water , housing , heat sources ( gas , electricity , coal , etc ) and food . 
  this would not mean that people can not earn a living with providing these necessities , but you are not allowed to speculate nor go to the stock market . 
  how that is organized could change over time . 
  there is no european constitution - the thing they tried to sell us as one , was n't . 
  just saying . 
  you can also replace ` right ' with ` left ' and it is still true . 
   it is the constant abortions starting at age 12 ( for girls and boys ) after having sex with a politician/priest long before that while drinking beer . 
   i guess the writer is german in nationality/mentality/outlook but culturely turkish , which i think is the point the writer is missing . 
  did we read the same article ? 
  i believe the bigger part of the article was written to make clear that that is not the case . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.theonion.com/articles/pope-forgives-molested-children,101/ ) you mean ? 
  yes you are right , i should have added : and make a move in a gigantic religio-political game of blame-shifting . 
  as in many cases the onion said it best : [ pope forgives molested children ] ( http://www.theonion.com/articles/pope-forgives-molested-children,101/ ), 
   you can only be that ignorant if you do n't ** believe ** what happened in the past . 
   father bochynski insisted that `` now that we have so many broken marriages , where most often there is a lack of a father , it will happen more and more often that children without such figures will cling on to men . '' dear church , so you use these children 's misery to hammer down your ideas about marriage ? 
  this is so fucked up , i have no words . 
  it might have been that way in the dark ages . 
  iirc edit : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frisia, 
  in germany there are people who still talk frysk but there are not that many - or so i am told . 
  the rest there talks ` platt ' ( gronings with a lot more german ) . 
  the part of denmark is a different story apparently . 
  you could also fill in the ddr again , because there are people who want to bring that back , or at least go separate from the old brd go towards a more socialist direction ( and most definitely minus the stasi ) . 
  succeeded with their goals . 
  and i 'm wondering on what idea/assumption the unification of these parts of three counties that are frisian in name and everything in between is based on . 
  for instance : groningen is not frisian , and has not been frisian in a long time . 
  amen, 
   [ in 2013 , it was confirmed that at least 200 of the artworks were under warrant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_plunder ), 
   approximately 20 % of the art in europe was looted by the nazis , and there are well over 100,000 items that have not been returned to their rightful owners . 
  the majority of what is still missing includes everyday objects such as china , crystal or silver . 
  and how much was recovered since 1945 in total ? 
   and here i just ** thought ** my country grew a pair of balls . 
  or was it ** hoped ** ? 
  if nation states and intelligence agencies go hand in hand , what then ? 
  only one way to find out ... 
  first they do not tell you about it , then they lie about it and now you want them to sign they will never do it again ? 
  sounds a lot like going back to a partner who cheated on you again and again because he pinky swears never to do it again . 
  the only reason why this is being proposed is because certain politicians will lose voters if they continue dealing with the us as a partner without . 
  i was wondering about that - thanks for correcting me . 
  i suspected as much , but we fought for like 80 years against the spanish habsburgs to become independent . 
  i 'm not sure what your stance is on such things ? 
  why 2020 ? 
  by the americans you mean . 
   he makes children laugh when i was young zwarte piet was there to punish you , not to make you laugh . 
  he took you with him to spain so you could work there if you had been bad . 
  they already changed that in the last 40 years . 
  based on certain things - as i 've said elsewhere already - i do not think he is human , but a devil instead . 
  look at another companion to st. nicolas called [ krampus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/companions_of_saint_nicholas#krampus ), 
  so we may not protest against the old tradition to pogrom in certain countries ? 
  and the austrians http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/companions_of_saint_nicholas, 
  black peter , i 'm still wondering - especially based on certain drawings about [ krampus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/companions_of_saint_nicholas#krampus ) , another companion to saint nicholas - if he is human . 
  i would say he is a devil , which would mean he is black because of the fires in hell .
