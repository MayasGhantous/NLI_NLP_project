   also , communism and socialism are not the same thing . 
  you do n't need to explain me that . 
  and yes , these are conservatives but this is what comes up again and again and is shown in its extreme in this list . 
  i 'm not fucking trolling , i 'm serious . 
  to me america is a backwards country . 
  it is old ( 2005 ) and images are lacking but here is an [ american list of most harmful books made ] ( http://www.humanevents.com/2005/05/31/ten-most-harmful-books-of-the-19th-and-20th-centuries/ ) notice that the communist manifesto is at the top with a score of 74 . 
  mein kampf is below that with a score of just 41 . 
  books below that always are a couple of points less evil . 
  there are a lot of socialist/communist books on there , as is the kinsey report . 
  this is one of the reasons that i see america as one of the enemies of humanity . 
   if you say someone 's a liberal it is worse than if you say he 's a nazi . 
  i 'm wondering when this is going to be true for the rest of europe ( this has been true for for a long time for america if you supplant liberal with socialist ), 
  yes , i know i am old , but i am not that old . 
  well , relax , have a drink and enjoy the party . 
  indeed it is :  [ ... in those days it was a very ambitious project to join many countries together in a wide-area international network . 
  satellite television did not exist , and the so-called ** eurovision network ** comprised a terrestrial microwave network . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurovision#origins ) to the top with him !, 
  of course , it is always the easy answer and now i still do not know where this awfull word comes from in our language . 
  with us ` er ' can mean : here , or there or at this/that moment , can be part of the passive construction and sometimes it is just mixed in for the fun of it because the sentence seems empty without it . 
  in short : if you know how to use it , you know dutch . 
  i 'm not against a unified europe - but being dutch is part of my identity , even though i have been living in germany for almost 7 years and even though i do not want to mingle with dutch people who are here in berlin . 
  i think that it is important to remember your background to see what parts could be useful for people with other backgrounds and identities in this circle of stars on a blue background . 
  besides : on some occasions it is good to know where people are coming from because it can help to interpret their point of view . 
  there are still many ` regional ' differences today , and every country has its own history . 
  well , thank you . 
  i fucked up by mentioning ` you ' instead of ` i ' but for the rest i think it is close enough for someone without having any classes . 
  the word ` er ' - does it have an important meaning ? 
  in my language it is one of the most dificult words to master and the length of the entry in the dictionary is not as big as the entry for ` to be ' but longer as ` to have ' . 
  i wanted that to remain a surprise . 
  edit : i am not at liberty to confirm nor deny what is said in the edit above . 
  you can rust that to my crack, 
  and i am more and more thinking about learning one of the scandinavian languages . 
  nonante = belgian french, 
  who let the tourists in ? 
  madurodam is that way !, 
  where are the gauls when you need them to kick some ass !, 
  \u00eb ftw !, 
  du = you er = there or here or in a situation ? 
  the westland dialect ? 
  jaelper = helping something something you are not an expert but it would help to learn the westland dialect to be able to read islandic ? 
  ( based on my knowledge of dutch , german , english and the northern dialect of the dutch/german border zone ), 
  he asked you to look at something that was not there - so no : no clue, 
  i 'm asking myself what is worse ... 
  you could try and turn the sea between your countries into a polder . 
  we dutchies can probably help you there . 
  then you can be one nation . 
  damn , i flunked the test did n't i ? 
  well , til , thank you !, 
  but nobody was allowed in iirc , there was this island where people from outside were allowed to stay and do business . 
  but you have better literature . 
  too bad : i hoped that it would be something like 1820 or so , so we could be certain the map that was copied from , was made between 1815 and 1820 :-), 
  nope : http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/tien_voor_taal sorry , no english link : - s basically it is a contest between flemish and dutch teams . 
  based on the state of belgium being part of the netherlands we can conclude that the map used as an original for this copy was made between 1815 and 1830 . 
  when did switzerland stand on it 's own two feet ? 
  belgium was part of the netherlands between 1815 until 1830 - maybe the map was copied in 1856 but the map it was a copy from was older . 
  but yes , we are a bit embarrassed about belgium , especially since they are better at dutch than we are ( there used to be a tv-program where a belgian and a dutch team tested their language skills and the belgians always won . ), 
  probably by the dutch since they were ** at some point ** the only ones allowed to trade with them , afaik . 
  edit : see u/vayl below - i was mistaken , other nations were also allowed but not all at the same time . 
  i like how norway and sweden seem like two jaws of a monster ready to devour denmark . 
   [ switzerland has existed as a state in its present form since the adoption of the swiss federal constitution in 1848 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/switzerland ) to be fair it existed before that . 
   the precursors of switzerland established a protective alliance at the end of the 13th century ( 1291 ) , forming a loose confederation of states which persisted for centuries . 
  or it is the other way around : they had no intention to explore , so there is no need for a better map . 
  well , he did not get asylum from the german government . 
  well , she was offered a big swat of money to star in a porno . 
  but what if sarah palin claims she is tina fey - and that she was send to europe to trick us ? 
  do you really want to risk to smudge your stake with sarah palin ? 
  when it happens you can not miss it , is my experience , because people are discussing it long before and after the event because they are so disgusted/disappointed/enraged etc. 
   hc-ott-vver-dom-me that would be more like it, 
  yes you are right but both ` leier ' and ` lijer ' are not in the official green book ( ` het groene boekje ) , though i have to confess that mine is red ( the van dale version ) and is from 1997 . 
  ` kankerlijer is though . 
  anyway , i have lived in berlin for the past 7 years . 
  did we have another spelling reform already , or not ? 
  or ` godverdommense ' - depending on where you are from . 
  this and ` leier ' are in no way official words . 
  depending on which part from switzerland you are from , i believe . 
  as a dutch man in berlin people sometimes assume i am swiss based on my accent . 
  but since i know and met a couple of people from switzerland i know that only some have the same funny dialect and are mistaken for dutch from time to time when speaking ` hoch-deutsch ' . 
  extra credits if you are able to pronounce it . 
  hardly anybody manages our ` g ' - especially at the beginning of a word - and that is why ` godverdomme ' ( ` god damn me ' ) is our favorite swear word . 
   he 's not accountable to the european parliament , ** so he does n't have to come . 
  ** i think that would have been a better start of your comment . 
  it is not , but that is what you do when you are head of state or a company : you take responsibility for the institution you represent . 
  or so it should be . 
  i think they should just send sarah palin , provided that we may burn her at the stake . 
  i think that is a win/win for both regions . 
  provided they do not send tina fey by accident . 
  in dutch we would just call him a ` godverdommesse kanker tering tyfus leier ' ( someone with cancer , typhoid , tbc and damned by god ) - but that is just our colorful language . 
  same for the netherlands . 
  germany is mostly dubbed - but at least in berlin you can get subbed movies in certain cinemas . 
  i do n't know why but i have subreddit style on , but do not see flair . 
  edit : found it , so you are from rumania . 
  this is much better, 
   us who ? 
  i guess these are rubber - the ones the police is using . 
  my grandfather was basically a hippy , refusing to go to the army , crossing the country withut a job , while theorizing about a better world . 
  that was before he became a communist . 
  so that is why it is ok to beat up people with different skin color and lgbt people ? 
  what i have been hearing for years it is bad , very , very bad . 
  there are movies floatin on the internet about it for like 10 years or so ( self made movies of people practicing , then beating someone up ) .
