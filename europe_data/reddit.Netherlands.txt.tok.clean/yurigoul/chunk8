  what effect do you think the [ military intervention in libya ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_libya ) had ? 
  right , we helped because we bombed the shit out of some people . 
  did it really help ? 
  did they get to rebuild their country and guarantee a peaceful live for everyone ? 
  did we stop supporting the people who are supporting the islamic state people ? 
   example ( in german ) . 
  not the same thing because this case is about selling coffee mugs and t-shirts with someone 's likeness on it without permission . 
  the guy was cool with being filmed if you look at the film though - https://youtu.be/fwsnthcwiy4?t=36s, 
  well , as long as you get in front of a judge for stealing 10.000 euro , why do you not get into jail for endangering the economy on the level that has happened not that long ago , and all for personal gain ? 
  would n't make that you a little angry and destructive ? 
  just a little suggestion . 
  did you ever try to protest for your ideals then ? 
   these guys want to violently change the way of life of all people i really do not see how you come to that conclusion , did you study their ideas ? 
  maybe you have to ask yourself why there is no thorough reaction to what snowden has shown , why bankers are not brought to jail , why the secret trade agreements with america are kept secret , why there is an economic model in the eu that is based on growth and it is clear that that is incompatible with both stopping global warming and a better economy for everyone instead of just the 10 % in the west . 
  these things and the police being used again and again in a war scenario against the people they have been sworn to protect might be cause for a little aggression now and again . 
   they respond to any infraction of the law . 
  personally i have heard too many stories about police officers for instance taping over their registration numbers before hitting you in the face or something similar , to start to doubt them being impartial . 
  but lets stick to what is proven , like stories about provocateurs on many levels ( [ remember the undercover cop from the uk that even fathered children and was on several occasions a provocateur ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/19/undercover-policeman-married-activist-spy ) ) , or extreme violence ( [ remember genua g8 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/17/italy.g8 ) ) this is how europe deals with protests against europe . 
  i 'm not sure what you think , but the organization of this protest talks about police using a scenario for war against their own citizens - and this would mean that even the smallest thing may be interpreted as a provocation and then you are allowed to react with violence . 
  well , what can i say but thatsmyfettish.gif, 
  because they volunteer for it i can only see it as the cheap satisfaction of a fetish under the presence of the law - and that makes me wan na puke . 
  but there is indeed a difference with the me in the netherlands : in germany there are always as many officers as there are demonstrators - they are asking for a confrontation on so many levels . 
  whereas in the netherlands this hardly ever happens , so less provocation, 
   but then the stuttgart 21 protests happened as a friend of mine put it : ` endlich mal die mittelschicht die in die fresse kriegt ' or to translate it roughly : finally the normal civilians find out how it is to be treated like garbage by the police . 
  very often police are volunteering to do the job they have to do at demonstrations and it is not as if it the police force a welcoming environment for people who have an alternative outlook on life . 
  if you look at the police cars and the papers they are reading they all are boulevard press right wing politics oriented . 
  there is/was a group of police officers that organized themselves in a group for more left/liberal oriented people , but their numbers are dwindling if not disappearing completely . 
  so yes , it might be stupid to just fight the police , but it is just as stupid to go and smash a demonstration because you want to . 
  a police force needs to be an independent institution , but if they all clearly have one political view on life , you might want to ask yourself what is wrong with that picture . 
  well - if the one is american , chances are the other is dominated by europeans , so ... 
  but that said , i do not know any hard facts about the userbase of / r/worldnews, 
  or the european variant of [ anti-deutsche ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-germans_\\ ( political_current \\ ) ) ? 
  / r/news is american news , so ... 
  also the grammar variant ? 
    now , we need to focus on redpilling reddit so , in short : they are also mens ' rights activists ? 
  how about starting some / r/anti-european ? 
  ( is not made - yet ), 
  can someone analyze this and explain how much of this is true or not ? 
  not again !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhbt6bjfvca ), 
  can someone explain what is wrong with parking a bike like that ? 
  it is nowhere near the middle of the sidewalk , it is at the edge of the sidewalk . 
  look , there is marking there where someones property begins directly behind the bike . 
  i 'm a minister in the universal life church - i do not mind changing my ... congregation :-), 
  yes : i believe russia uses people to influence social media yes : ukraine is in a shitty place right now because of all the shitty fucked up things russia does but no , sorry , trying to appeal to past cold war sentiments to influence public opinion ? 
  that will not fly . 
  not with me anyway . 
  not sure if i should downvote for the smell of bulshit or upvote , because i would really like to discuss this . 
  would it help if there were more official members ? 
  yes , we should do that what isis wants us to do : isolate the islamists in the hope that they become more extremist . 
  or the extreme right political parties . 
  for starters, 
   while * our interpretation * the older book is right , duh !, 
  could also be * our translation * or * our edition * but in the end it always boils down to interpretation . 
  i went to live in another country , but unfortunately more and moar dutchies followed the same path - so i feel your pain ( i think so ), 
   no respect for her feminine parts , as a gypsy . 
  this is connected to her being a gypsy how ? 
  ah , forget it , obvious racism is racism . 
  ah , do n't worry - maybe it is not my day :-), 
  sex is possible but within the sanctity of marriage of course . 
  people marry young because of it . 
  not sure if they make many converts . 
  edit : btw , it is called the [ dutch bible belt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bible_belt_%28netherlands%29 ), 
  did they do that in america ? 
  edit ; there are various brands of protestantism that went to the states ( i forgot the names ) but there were also enough that stayed behind . 
  edit2 : you ever heard of the terrible incest cases from the netherlands in the 80 's ? 
  they are all from that region . 
  in the north of the netherlands this is ... true in certain parts :-) artikel 33 , [ vrijgemaakt gereforfmeerd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reformed_churches_in_the_netherlands_%28liberated%29 ) etc etc edit - for the english speaking community : too many flavors of protestantism that do not allow you to do dick and you have to marry to be allowed to fuck - and no cursing damnit !!!, 
  edit 2 : maybe artikel 33 is called the [ restored reformed church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/restored_reformed_church ) it is centered around staphorst, 
  ah thank you , this clarifies a lot . 
  well , actually i have no idea how it works in russia . 
  you use this word ` roskomnadzor ' and when i pronounce it , it sounds really scary . 
  so i just hope the guy did not get punished or something . 
  that sounds bad ... 
  belgium = the catholics , do not fear them , they know how to drink and party . 
  but the netherlands , that is another story . 
  the dutch , they are the most conservative , protestant , narrow minded people there are whose main source of amusement is toilet and sex jokes . 
  there are way too many people there who have been quarreling about interpretation of bible passages during the last 500 years or so . 
  this becomes the most clear in small towns . 
  there you very often have for instance two bakeries , one for one splitter religious group and one for the other . 
  churches look terrible on the inside , no place to show how you enjoy live . 
  the front door in many houses is only used when you are baptized , getting married or when you are dead - and those are also the only occasions you wear something nice . 
  for the rest of the time you enter through the backyard . 
  at least they have a sense of humor ... 
  it was only a short time iirc edit : [ indeed - it was only a short time , it was about a drug post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/comments/3grpdf/ ) ( how to grow psylos/magic mushrooms in russian ), 
  good news everyone :  [ perdido street station is the second published novel by china mi\u00e9ville and the first of three independent works set in the fictional world of bas-lag , a world where both magic \\ ( referred to as ` thaumaturgy ' \\ ) and steampunk technology exist . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perdido_street_station ) * the scar * is the second in that universe ( the world of [ bas-lag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bas-lag ) ) and * iron council * is the third . 
  they are however not sequels . 
  i love how there are so many things hinted at , so you immediately get the feeling ` where is the sequel ? ', 
  - but there is none . 
  it is just part of his style . 
  china melville , * the city and the city * might be a book for you . 
  it is a book about two cities that are actually the same city but it is more fucked up than east - and west-berlin used to be . 
  nice how the neo-fascist and populistas use left wing view points they used to spit upon for their own fucked up goals . 
   if only by being making people aware what the situation is exactly . 
  first hand experience is always better than fear mongering, 
  in soviet russia banks hack you ? 
  i 'll show myself out and bow my head in shame for this overly aged meme ... 
  behold , the mystery power of capitalism explained !, 
  through the ages a lot of things have been forbidden - from jokes to pornography and drugs .
