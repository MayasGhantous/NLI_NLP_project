  we are a very creative species , i would say . 
  sometimes the others win , the other times we lose . 
  could be a nice one for / r/askhistorians, 
  should n't that be america nowadays ? 
   bul\u0103 is going to the school band show , violin box in his hand . 
  he opens the box and takes out a machine gun . 
  everybody throw themselves to the ground , and the headmaster asks :  - bul\u0103 , what ... what are you doing with a machine gun at a concert ? 
   - me , nothing ... wonder what dad will be doing with a violin at the party congress . 
  we had a similar joke because of a group of indonesians that held people hostage in trains during the 70 's . 
  / r/europe is full , gtfo, 
  the lie is already around the world before the truth can get its boots on . 
  so , first the racists and now you get friendly visits by the police ? 
  and coming in handy with all the neo-nazis and populistas . 
  hate speech can be brought to justice , and it fucking should . 
  slander , calls for violence and hate speech are prohibited - as in many civilised countries . 
  since the tweets itself are not there you do not know what hell they were saying . 
   bbs though i could be considered that old , i only got into computers at age 25 or so at the end of the eighties , but did not go online until 1996 . 
  but i do have an old slashdot account that i forgot the password and email address to ... 
  still not upgraded from the 80 's ? 
  pp = parent poster - op = original poster it bugs the shit out of me as well ... 
  source : russia today ? 
  the strategy could be : more anti muslim sentiment means isolation and subsequent radicalization of the muslim population , which means more soldiers for isis . 
  in that prison we give them special drugs that we also plan to do in the drinking water for our own population to make everybody more docile . 
  after that treatment they are as good as new . 
  you reap what you sow - so what we do now will be for our children and children 's children to reap the benefits from , or have to deal with . 
  we can of course try to change all that now . 
  there have been various countries who have been and still are paying money for the evil they did in the past . 
   how evil the west is . 
  [ well we have been and are still disrupting the political stability in the middle east and other parts of asia for over 200 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_great_game ) , so why are your surprised by that opinion ? 
  ow , sorry , i forgot : [ you can not change people 's ~ ~ believes ~ ~ opinions by facts ] ( http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/07/11/how_facts_backfire/ ) - how stupid of me to think that . 
  you can clearly recognize the people who have an agenda by the words they choose . 
  do n't try to turn my argument into something that it is not - we are not on the same page here . 
  the fact that racists like you are becoming more mainstream does not make it any more right than it was in 1933, 
  this is europe , not hollywood, 
  we will join poland coming from the other direction . 
  race you too berlin !, 
  ( i am already living there , the joke is on me ! ), 
  my question was : high rises = more people in the same square meter because they are living on top of each other . 
  is there still enough solar power generated from those square meters for all those people ? 
  even on a high rise/flat ? 
  that makes sense . 
  but it has to be rather high because of trucks and then , what happens on a windy day ? 
  it can not be more expensive than building it into the road , i would say . 
  one point could be that there is not that much space in the netherlands . 
  you could put them on roofs though ... 
  amen !, 
  and praise the god/es for showing me their light !, 
  ( thank you brother/sister for your assistance ), 
   prods funny thing is the protestants in the netherlands are boring as hell . 
  thank god we traded access to the sea with the belgians for some land , so now we have us some catholics and they at least know how to party ( and have more beautiful churches ) . 
  funny how it can depend on the country, 
  man walks into a bar ... 
  oxford , right . 
  is probably worse , amiright ? 
  i like to joke about my religion - and jokers have a special part in it , since the truth is so far out of our reach that it can only be told as a joke , and in the one instance that you get the joke , you have a sense of the truth and then - puff - it 's gone ... 
  does that make my believe not a religion ? 
   it gets so bad in the netherlands that you can drive 10 km and barely be able to understand someone when he is using dialect . 
  i know that from groningen during the end of the seventies and the eighties - i think that is just the way things were and it used to be way worse before television/radio . 
  in certain cases the language of one country gradually morphs into another language the closer you get to a border . 
  ( for the ~ ~ foreigners ~ ~ , eh ~ ~ non-dutchies ~ ~ , eh non-frysians/groninger : * ` net ' * means * ` not ' * in frysian and * ` more or less ' * in groningen - so the frysian will/could \\* read it as ' ** that will not work ** ' , someone from groningen will read it as ' ** that could more or less work ** - there is also a parking joke about it ) \\* warning : i am not frysian and i can only understand most groninger dialects, 
  i am not a lawyer , but my main question is : how do you create a law that defines if something is ` the customs of the people ' the people in a country are all the people who live there and have citizenship . 
  their body of customs is therefor ` the customs of the people ' but people who immigrate and get a passport of that country also have citizenship . 
  you want to exclude their customs . 
  at the moment you say ` customs of people who come from the far east and from parts of africa are not part of the customs of the citizens ' it seems to you are implying there are two types of citizens . 
  in most countries this would be against the constitution . 
  if they would go another route , but clearly describing what the customs are and everything else is forbidden , well , good luck with that and on top of that it will be within a year that teenagers will be arrested en mass for thinking out something new . 
  grat impliziert . 
  you are clearly not a lawyer, 
  i would like to hear a lawyer about this , this really sounds like a possible backdoor to make it possible to wear burkas again . 
  the ` einheimische brauchtums ' could be defined as the traditions of all the people living somewhere and is always subject to change over time . 
  how big a percentage of the population needs to be of a certain creed to make it a tradition ? 
   [ you are so white you are 0xgggggg ] ( http://alienlovespredator.com/2010/01/19/youre-so-white/ ), 
  for the love of the fsm why do people have the audacity/stupidity to downvote someone for asking a question ? 
   a puritanical clergy that is often imported or at least financed by backers in the gulf states source ? 
  before there was a law against holocaust denial there were other laws in place as well, 
  afaik it was 6.000.000 jews and then 5.000.000 others from all over europe . 
  but together with war victims it would be about 17 million . 
  ns germany killed 11.000.000 people in concentration camps . 
  they had to have a law to prevent that from being denied - since there were many people who were still nazis after the war . 
  ` do not trust anybody over 30 ' was a saying a decade after the war - because those where the ones who were probably nazis during . 
  there were even many judges and other officials who served during the ns regime . 
  one guy who prosecuted many war criminals had at some point use the israel secret service to get someone convicted for his war crimes because he got so much opposition from his colleagues . 
  today there are still crimes committed by neo-nazis - burning of immigrant homes is a constantly recurring event , for instance . 
  and you want the government to stay out of it ? 
  fuck that !, 
  that story with the pensions , that sucks . 
  i interpreted it as ' i am going to defeat the european monster ' - but i will stick now with your explanation . 
  for me there is the difference between the connection to the internet and the transport to me . 
  my provider has no right going to the content providers i have chosen to demand more money from them because i have chosen them . 
  my provider gives me access to the internet with a certain speed and data volume for all i care - and that is it . 
  edit : icann has fought a long time against a . xxx or . sex tld because of fears it would mean people with different opinions will be banished there . 
  this is the exact same situation because there are big chances this will be used to filter based on politics, 
  the problem is that you - the consumer - already pays for access to the internet . 
  why should the companies you contact over the internet also pay ? 
  big companies  lobyists  government  regulations  ??? 
  we have to ask the government alright , but we - the people - are doing that in our free time , whereas the other party have a legion of high payed lobyists on their payrole who do that as their day job . 
  same discrepancy is visible when you try to fight certain government projects on a smaller scale : the government just ups their marketing and pr budget , and you rely on the hours after you stopped working and before you have to do the rest of you life . 
  btw : how about [ marital rape ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marital_rape_\\ ( united_states_law \\ ) ) to tackle this situation ? 
  as in : ok you can stay married , but you better not have sex with your wife until she is of legal age ? 
  edit : in the wikipedia page under [ ` current state laws ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marital_rape_\\ ( united_states_law \\ ) \\ #current _ state_laws ) a lot is said about ` against the will of ' , ` without consent ' etc.
