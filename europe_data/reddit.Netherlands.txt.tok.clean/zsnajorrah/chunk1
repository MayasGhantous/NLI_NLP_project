indeed . 
  as you 've undoubtedly understood by now , rotterdam and amsterdam are often referred to as 010 and 020 , respectively . 
  the prefix for utrecht is 030 and the hague has 070 . 
  with those four prefixes , you 've got the randstad just about covered . 
  other notable prefixes are 050 ( groningen ) and 040 ( eindhoven ) . 
  while the big cities have round numbers , smaller cities near the big ones often have derivative prefixes . 
  of course , there are many exceptions to this rule . 
  by the way , 060 , 080 and 090 are not in use , as those are used for other means . 
  06 is the standard prefix for mobile numbers , while 0800 and 0900 are prefixes for free and paid information services , respectively . 
  a full list of dutch area code prefixes [ can be found here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telephone_numbers_in_the_netherlands `` telephone numbers in the netherlands - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia '' ) . 
  ** edit : ** obviously , 000 is not in use either , as 00 is the global prefix for international calls . 
  or , more precisely , rotterdam vs amsterdam . 
  i 'm neither 010 nor 020 , so i 'm unbiased ; i like both . 
  rotterdam really * is * very cool . 
  why is n't that allowed any more ? 
  i 'm guessing because the structural integrity of it ca n't be guaranteed anymore , or is there another reason ? 
  what a beautiful place this is . 
  this location looks like a photographer 's dream . 
  i might just visit it some time . 
  in that case i 'd like to see a list of the * lowest * points of europe . 
  ours is nearly seven metres below sea level . 
  edit : ah , i see [ that we can shake hands ] ( http://geography.about.com/od/learnabouttheearth/a/extremes_2.htm ) . 
  low five !, 
  oh god , i ca n't stop laughing . 
  wheeeeeeeee !, 
  zero points . 
  no shit . 
  the netherlands are always looked down upon because our country is supposedly so flat . 
  but no more . 
  more . 
  eat shit , denmark !, 
  takte that germany !, 
  i am , too , actually . 
  things finally seem to be moving forward , without even the slightest * hint * at military intervention . 
  all through careful and patient politics and diplomacy . 
  that 's one of the reasons why i do n't really agree with the author of this article . 
  i agree . 
  i do n't necessarily agree with bas heijne 's article . 
  i just thought it was an interesting thought piece . 
  it was the first journalistically sound piece i read that mirrored the sentiments of a large portion of the dutch people . 
  i thought it would be interesting to spark a debate on this topic here . 
  oh yeah , i knew that . 
  i submitted this to the wrong subreddit . 
  will correct this now . 
  thanks for the heads up !, 
  i am not a clever man . 
  indeed . 
  worded like this , wilders does seem a little less threatening . 
  i did n't vote , simply because i forgot to do so . 
  i really * wanted * to vote ( pro-eu , by the way ) , though . 
  but alas , i only remembered i had to vote when it was already too late . 
  aaaaaaand ... we 're full circle . 
  somebody already had one , i 'd say ... 
  i do n't know whether or not this is known here already , but this image has been proven to be a photoshop job . 
  the original image , from which the parts to create this one have been taken , [ can be seen here ] ( https://www.anpfoto.nl/search.pp?page=1&amp;showpicture=26461026&amp;pos=37 `` anp foto '' ) . 
  the shadow was added in separately . 
  i am disappointed . 
  totally agree with you !, 
  hertog jan is nice , but by no means the best . 
  a simple lager like gulpener wipes hertog jan 's ass , if you ask me . 
  but then there are the special beers . 
  that is a whole world of wonders . 
  my personal dutch favourite brewery is that from my home town : jopen . 
  they really do n't make a beer that * does n't * taste at least * good * . 
  but even among all those nice beers , i have my favourites . 
  i 'd say ** johannieter ** ( a heavy double bock ) , ** lentebier ** ( a spring bock ) and ** koyt ** ( a brownish-red , spicy beer ; it 's not kuyt , as you wrote , by the way ) are the ones i return to most often . 
  no , no , no . 
  that shit is the bomb . 
  to his preemptive defence , i 'm incredibly bad at remembering jokes . 
  i sometimes hear a really funny joke one day , yet will be unable to recite it the next . 
  this has nothing to do with being unintelligent . 
  or drunk . 
  he * is * belgian , after all . 
  if anything , i 'd say it 's a * good * thing . 
  to me , people always telling jokes often come across as a little simple . 
  the funny thing is , is that this joke accidentally makes fun of the french , too . 
  i 'd love to read some belgian jokes about the dutch . 
  could you give us some examples , from the top of your head ? 
  this actually brought a tear to my eye . 
  especially the '' ... my old enemy , ... my rival , ... my neighbour , ... my ally , ... my friend '' part . 
  beautifully done , with much honour and respect . 
  and i 'm not even a brit or a frenchman , but a mere dutchie . 
  we love both of you guys !, 
  they can into sea ? 
  they can * what * into sea ? 
  * what ?!, 
  i will gladly step outside for a confrontation . 
  shall we do a drinking contest ? 
  i 'll bring a bottle of lagavulin 16 . 
  oh wait , i 'm mixing the names . 
  god , i 'm sorry for the confusion . 
  yes , of course whisky is the scottish name . 
  it 's the us spelling , with the added e , that i dislike . 
  i always drink highland and islay single malts anyway . 
  this is in the netherlands . 
  thank you for correcting me ; i was convinced that whisky is how it was written in the us . 
  as we tend to drink scottish whiskey here anyway , we almost always see it written with an e. i always write those s/z verbs with an s , too . 
  in school , we are mostly taught the british english spelling of certain words , too . 
  so for example colour instead of color , neighbour instead of neighbor , whiskey instead of whisky and grey instead of gray . 
  i myself try to use british english ( both in spelling and pronunciation ) as much as possible .
