its booming bureaucracy and idiotic procedures ( led by the brussels-strasbourg moving circus ) are getting bloody annoying . 
  as is half of the regulations . 
  on the other side , there are some good pro-consumer or anti-monopoly cases , shengen is * comfortable * . 
  eea and efta are even better . 
  but those things could be in place without all the negatives ... as for the stability and internal consistency , you could clearly see lack of both at the start of the ukraine crisis . 
  first , the region 's security was n't important enough for the politicians to get to do their job during a weekend and then it took them forever to reach at least some consensus , which was `` meh , we ca n't reach consensus , you tell them merkel '' . 
  so the only real commitment is to grab as much resources as possible for each other 's area of interest . 
  that 's something that becomes very clear once you start working within the machinery of european projects . 
  classical music ( and that 's individuals , not the nation ) and dashcam videos . 
  we 'll see about that . 
  if they manage to load them on wagons and transport them to the country they are assigned to , i assume most of them stays . 
  kindly take this `` you do n't get it '' rhetoric and stick it where sun never shines , all of this are just hypotheses . 
  that `` we will accept everyone '' proclamation is outdated . 
  last i heard those who receive asylum permit lose it the moment they leave the country they were assigned to . 
  well , your oh-so-hilarious photo mock-up did n't turn out to be all too close to reality , did it ? 
  yes , can all blacks join ? 
  considering their birth rate , it should be a lot of kids . 
  and i hear isis pays quite generously for those . 
  oh wait , i sold them to be able to afford smugglers . 
  attention-whoring before his second futile attempt at presidency . 
  yeah , comparing tens of thousands of people from mostly the same cultural heritage to over a million of people who think they have the right to demand anything by force ( as seen on the serbia-hyngary border right now ) and who have completely different value priorities ... not to mention the painful shortsighted-ness of people like juncker who think they can just tell the `` refugees '' where they should settle . 
  well , he should * just deal with it * . 
  yes , skodas in germany are cheaper than in its ( former ) homeland \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  thank you germany for providing great selection of reasonably priced used cars for people living in czechia . 
  it 's not really the easiest [ punctuation mark ] ( http://puu.sh/gvesi/e5ef86fa1d.jpg ) , but making plural * is * on of the most elementary things in english . 
  yes , i hate the misuse of it a lot as well :p, 
  what 's the reason for those apostrophes in op ? 
  well , startpage is operated by ixquick , is n't it ? 
  i 'm using ddg as default because of the instant answers , but startpage for more difficult queries . 
  ... or just use startpage.com, 
  i think it 's just a coincidence in this case . 
  european union 's institutions . 
  well , if that 's the lifestyle they chose , you ca n't expect me to pity any of them . 
  and yes , that 's clearly the intention of the gallery . 
  maybe they would n't be so poor if they did n't have two or more kids . 
  ** never mind ** - v. : * indicates a withdrawal of a previous statement . 
  * do not regard it ; it is of no consequence ; no matter . 
  yep , both are populists full of rubbish . 
  nice display of how eu ( and probably many of the national governments ) is exactly like the us - controlled by corporations . 
  maybe it 's even worse in eu considering the cancer-inducing diesel * still * has lower taxes on it . 
  wow , i was completely confused by the news about it . 
  oh well , thanks for clearing that up . 
  inb4 someone blames this on american imperialism, 
  of course they 're illegal after they abandoned net neutrality . 
  isps can now charge extra for pron and i have no doubts they eventually will . 
  for the citizens ' own good , of course . 
  edit : never mind !, 
  strange . 
  how come efdd is either for or abstained , but all czechs voted against ? 
  petr mach is in efdd . 
  is there an alternative source ? 
  edit : funnily enough , a [ kiwi source ] ( http://www.odt.co.nz/news/world/357702/migrants-giving-german-hoteliers-boost ) cites reuters, 
  i do n't like your flag , mate . 
  heh , i guess i 've manage to avoid that part of reddit somehow . 
  yeah , not that different . 
  except the average czech has to save money for three times longer than an average american ( or german ) to buy the same thing , like a car or some electronics . 
  :p edit : words, 
  do n't bulk germany and czechia into one as if they were the same case . 
  the differences in salaries are huge - same thing when comparing czechia to us . 
  have you tried living in america ? 
  law and order are good things . 
  you follow the law of the land you 're in . 
  no exception . 
  i was never talking about falsifying . 
  and if it 's going to be the same as tpp , it will be public * after * it 's settled . 
  what kind of conspiracy theory ? 
  one of the few known facts about it is that big number of american corporations are involved in the negotiations ( of both [ tpp ] ( http://tppcoalition.org/about/ ) and ttip ) , which are secret to public , something in itself unacceptable . 
  and some of the propaganda is completely laughable . 
  to make isds look nice , they claim that `` ttip would * tighten up * an existing system for settling disputes '' . 
  that so vague that it 's disgusting . 
  every single material they release is to promote the deal , not to inform about it . 
  they never say what are the downsides , only some * potential * benefits . 
  and yet , here you are , calling me a fool for not believing everything an advertisement says . 
  i know of that page . 
  some nice pieces of marketing material . 
  do you honestly believe that some one-sided `` fact sheets '' include everything that is be in the agreement ? 
  please . 
  yeah , most likely same approach to fairness as other corporations creating the ttip . 
   ttip will have to be approved by each eu member 's parliament how can they approve or disapprove of it when they do n't know its contents ? 
  the fact that you do n't even realize the stupidity of that statement shows how underfunded american education is . 
  heh , of course it is n't . 
  if we take certain eastern countries into consideration , it 's not even that bad . 
  well , of course if a country has more than a half of population size in comparison to the entire eu , it 's going to have a more or less correspondent academic output , and the total number of `` good '' universities will be higher just as well . 
  i live in czech republic , they have private universities here , like [ unicorn ] ( http://www.unicorn.eu/index.html ) . 
  i totally agree that most eu member states underfund their top educational facilities ( or education in general ) , but that 's even worse in us as far as i know . 
  i would n't say us has that many great universities ... ( considering the amount ), 
  many czech drivers do n't really give a shit about any rule though . 
  i 'm on a very limited connection right now , but i 'll check it later , thanks !, 
   what does the 2 % gdp target actually accomplish ? 
  actually capable armed forces , not just ones for show . 
   how is nato useless when countries spend slightly less on their military ? 
  your definition of '' [ slightly ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j6xp2rh.png ) '' is hilarious . 
   the world is in a very stable condition globally what world ? 
  not earth , that 's for sure . 
  well , it 's about time that changed . 
  no , nato is pointless when the majority of its members are slacking wankers who do n't fulfil their obligations towards nato , which is exactly what trump said . 
  quite complex , hard to learn for foreigners , not very pleasing to the ear . 
  some resource http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/czech_republic#language ( the greyhound translation is even correct ! ), 
  sure , fluently . 
  probably better than english .
