  it 's a horrible language though :d, 
  i grew up here , but i 'm still a kiwiboo , so to speak . 
  apparently i have some family roots here and both my parents and myself found a good job , so nobody really wants to move anywhere now . 
  have fun in nz !, 
  where are you staying ? 
  vic ? 
  :3 i live in prague though . 
  i guess i 'm an immigrant that did n't integrate very well . 
  i do n't know , it almost looks like they 're the proverbial immovable object . 
  ha , good point . 
  learn that the current eu leadership is a bunch of spiteful power-hungry wankers . 
  after everyone unanimously agrees that eu is literally jesus . 
  that 's because `` debunk '' is nowadays , apparently , synonymous with `` address '' or `` provide a different point of view '' . 
  how do you like to see your language being raped ? 
  i do n't see how empathy is relevant to a bunch of people risking death just to get richer . 
  i do n't see how empathy gives them any rights to the riches they seek . 
  i definitely do n't see how empathy should rule over reason and logic . 
  and lastly , i find it rather depressing that you think have `` empathy '' for people who risk their lives trying to illegally cross borders to get just more comfortable life , but you completely lack actual empathy for your countrymen . 
  then again , you might as well be one of those people who do n't believe in countries or nations . 
  no , stop moving the goalpost . 
  i was talking within the context of this thread , which is `` brexiters '' , which means presumably `` politicians , who supported brexit '' , i.e. 
  noteworthy and relevant people . 
  i was n't aware calling meetings and discussing a subject is `` shutting down debate '' . 
  oh well , the more you know ... 
  ah , yes , a piece from an incredibly biased media outlet based on two tabloid papers . 
  this proves everything !, 
  i do n't see any noteworthy people `` trying to shut down debate '' ... 
  there are n't any unbiased news sites of relevant size . 
  reuters/ap/etc . 
  are probably the closest . 
  while not as extreme , this is very common in prague . 
  are you saying diesel engines do n't have any issues when it 's freezing ? 
  about bloody time . 
  i 'm tired of sniffing the diesel cancer . 
  gasoline is just fine . 
  edit : talking about normal cars , not heavy trucks . 
  `` catch up '' ? 
  yeah , i bet the swedish local wo n't mention this ... 
  absolutely agreed . 
  i mean , making predictions/hypotheses is fine , but presenting them as undeniable facts on the other hand ... 
  impossible , breaxit means literal apocalypse . 
  markets will collapse , banks will close , nuclear war will break out . 
  well , even tiny subjects can cause massive damages by guerilla tactics . 
  that does n't make them powerful though . 
  i know that turkey ca n't deal with its own problems , that it tends to greatly overestimate its military strength , and that dictators tend to favour other dictators . 
  hypothesis . 
  putin must be quite happy with the access to nato documents/communication he 's probably getting from turkey . 
  taiwan did n't feel that safe when i was there ( regardless of the weather ) , but i 'm completely ignorant when it comes to real statistics of taiwan . 
  wow , i 'm surprised the country is in a rather good shape then . 
  i do n't see singapore in that list . 
  intothetrash, 
  no , it hoped to bring to company on the brink of bankruptcy and then buy it for pennies . 
  they did n't need magic wand to keep the company running . 
  and that 's one of the shittiest strawmen i saw this year . 
  in their case ? 
  strict immigration laws . 
  and guns as well , but in a way i 've already explained above . 
  to defend themselves and people around them from psychos who seem to be turning up more and more recently . 
  do you need any more details ? 
  do i have to explain how a firearm can be used for defence ? 
  or how psychos are dangerous ? 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/08/01/pound-drops-as-manufacturing-activity-shrinks-at-fastest-pace-in/ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/08/01/the-city-of-london-is-going-to-lose-business-from-brexit-say-fun/ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/28/brexit-recession-could-cost-banks-68bn/ wow , how utterly pro-brexit . 
   yes they were forced to do it or lose their benefits . 
  what , benefits are forced on them too then ? 
  til half is hardly worth anything, 
  yeah , from from 1.178 to 1.182 is literally nothing , while from 1.18758 to 1.178 for a split second is an absolute catastrophe . 
  yes , i know . 
  and my point was that that 's not what aeiy meant . 
  guns at homes in locked safes are useless , although technically legal . 
  i 'm aware of that . 
  but `` everyone '' does have a gun , unlike germany . 
  yes , i do know how you live , and a good deal about how you think . 
  and i also know you think you 're speaking for the majority . 
  you are n't . 
  nobody is proposing `` giving everyone guns '' . 
  but just so you know , yes , it does make a country safer . 
  see : switzerland . 
  but it 's safer in grander schemes than street level ( although that 's very good as well , just not as a result of the amount of weapons ) . 
   we germans do n't speak for others . 
   quite baffled why anyone would think more guns = more safe i guess you ca n't think outside of your bubble then . 
  yeah . 
  so it 's useless . 
  that 's what i mean by `` practically illegal '' . 
  it 's like saying that cars are legal without a driver 's license . 
  yes , it 's true to a certain degree , but not in terms of what the majority of people mean when they talk about it . 
  edit : oh , and i do n't quite understand how can a sane person say that there is `` no reason to carry a gun in germany '' after last week . 
  wow , i did n't think someone would be as daft to use `` police has guns '' as an argument . 
  what 's next , using armed front line soldiers as a proof of liberal firearm legislation ? 
   you can buy and own a weapon last i heard , only people who give a `` good reason '' for needing a firearm are allowed to buy and carry one for defence . 
  but correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  well , i consider telegraph to be very neutral in most aspects , brexit notwithstanding . 
  as for the drop , it 's [ bouncing back ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=eur&amp;view=12h ) steadily . 
  first of all , nobody is forcing them to do it . 
  secondly , it was 30 hours/week for one month . 
  the amount of welfare they got before ( that 's probably 6 or more months ) is , of course , ignored by everyone . 
  try looking outside of your bubble . 
  in some european countries ( uk , germany ... ) , they practically are illegal . 
  i like how media see random drops of stock prices/currency rates within hours and immediately start with doom-mongering . 
  how could you possibly be surprised ? 
  did n't you noticed how close the previous election was ?
