  good times ... 
  may might be ( and you can see how uk does n't really have any successful demagogues ) . 
  merkel is centrist and i am not honestly familiar enough with the rest to have an informed opinion ... 
  well , i do n't know , but regular right wing parties seem to be a rather rare sight here in europe . 
  and it has been the case since like the late '90s ... well , at least from what i 've seen anyway . 
  well , le pen is the kind of politician who loves to use strong and emotional statements ( i.e. 
  she 's a demagogue ) , so it is appropriate from her point of view . 
  i think it is safe to say that the times when politicians were supposed to have some class and be moral leaders are behind us . 
  not that english is a politician who can not behave , 
  probably because they are n't omnipresent . 
  well , if you were to choose between `` they are victims '' and `` they are scum '' , which would you pick ? 
  because the person who would do such a thing would very likely be imprisoned for an extended time period . 
  even if there somehow was someone who can legally carry a firearm which , as i understand it , is more or less forbidden for the general population . 
  for their protection !, 
  look closer . 
  and even if i was living outside of eu , i do n't see how it invalidates anything i would say . 
   juncker plans radical shake-up to save the eu from itself well , maybe he should start by kicking his spiteful sorry arse from ec . 
  that really is surprising considering the [ trouble it 's giving ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-09/sa-power-what-is-load-shedding-and-why-is-it-happening/8254508 ) in australia . 
  well , i ca n't exclude the possibility of me not reading too much into it and ending up misinformed as a result . 
  in fact , thinking about it , it does sound very likely . 
  they intended to build more coal plants and decided to build plants using renewable sources instead . 
  it was quite big on reddit , and i could n't find it - that was closest i could get with the time i was willing to spend on searching for it . 
  i do n't know when they have decided since you never know with these `` communists '' ( they can be really really slow ) , but the news was around quite [ recently ] ( http://fortune.com/2017/01/05/china-renewable-solar-energy-spending/ ) . 
  right , i forgot their recent surprising decision to cancel all the coal plans and invest in solar plants ( which they make themselves , so it is not that surprising i guess ) . 
  well , they definitely need it - especially around the large cities . 
  every bit would help . 
  :( you take that back !, 
  i was in hobbiton , they just were n't home . 
  of course , any move from fossil burning is `` pretty ok '' to say the least . 
  if only it was happening globally , not only in europe ... 
   you 're using numbers from a single year to create the appearance of a huge gap ( millions !, 
  thousands ! ), 
  i specifically address that in the very same paragraph . 
   and once you 're called out and shown that the numbers are n't bad at all ( addition of 1/16th annual energy production ) , you 're saying that the world is more way more complex . 
  mate , is this an act of sort or did you actually ignore not only the `` you forgot a word '' part from two posts ago , but that word in the original post as well ? 
  i specifically said `` if they were always at 100 % , which is unrealistic . '', 
  you started coming up with fairytale numbers while disregarding that , i called * you * out , and now you 're accusing me of backpaddling . 
  you certainly are making quite a lot of fun out of this . 
  i normally do not substitute `` energy '' with `` electricity '' as if they were the same thing , but i was going by guardian 's way of expressing . 
  wow , that 's even less than i thought . 
  eurostat has [ some data ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/3/3e/electrical-capacity-mw-eu28-2014.png ) on it as well . 
  it 's obviously quite a good outcome , but hardly as revolutionary as the guardian would like to make their readers think . 
  really . 
  pray tell me , where are those fake numbers in my first post ? 
  the number is eu net electricity generation for a year . 
   a number that took 100 years to build i do n't see how that 's relevant to anything . 
  it is the total annual electricity generation * now * . 
   so to continue your numbers game , starting from 2016 , in 16 years we 'll have 100 % renewables !, 
  yes , that would be the simplest prediction , but you forgot one very important , probably the most important word . 
  probably intentionally . 
  you you also seem to disregard that this trend is based on a single number ( so it is not really a trend ) and that trends generally do not , in fact , have linear course . 
  then again , unrealistic predictions can afford to disregard that . 
  `` new energy '' is a very generic term . 
  it might as well mean `` energy newly generated in 2016 '' , which , of course , means `` all energy generated in 2016 '' . 
  in fact , i 'm certain that a crushing majority of people does not know what exactly it really encompasses without reading into the article . 
  the subtitle `` wind energy overtakes coal as the eu 's second largest form of power capacity '' reinforces the misleading nature of this piece . 
  it is cheaper , because there is lesser tax burden on it for whatever misguided reason . 
  lorry lobbying probably helped it . 
  [ co2 emissions as well ] ( https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/10/diesel-how-it-changed-europe-and-how-europe-might-change-back/ ) . 
   it 's worth shit having the biggest fossil fuel reserves in the world if a partial transition happens in the next 30 years and a complete transition in 50 . 
  that 's ... optimistic , to put it lightly . 
  not that i would be totally against it . 
  what ? 
  what an utter pile of rubbish . 
  that title is misleading as hell . 
  what it actually means is `` 90 % of power plants built in 2016 use renewables '' . 
  which , of course , surprises no one at all since nuclear plants are already built and new reactors are still under way , and fossil fuel plants also already exist and are slowly being replaced by renewable sources , if possible . 
  and lastly , it was 21.1 gigawatts . 
  eu generates something like 3 million gigawatt hours a year . 
  just so that you are aware of the scale ... 
  note : first number is in gw , second in gwh . 
  those new renewable plants would generate slightly below 190 thousand gwh a year if they were always at 100 % , which is unrealistic . 
  ( feel free to provide more realistic calculations if you know how ), 
  i really wonder why diesel is * still * made artificially cheaper ... and i also wonder when gpfs for di gasoline cars are coming as a standard . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks for taking the time and writing that up . 
  quite extensive . 
  thank you very much !, 
  a particular topic ? 
  no , i would n't say so . 
  i 'm more interested in topic packages . 
  eu ( integration , regulation , subsidising ) , nuclear energy , taxes , federal regulation , immigration ( both internal and external to eu ) , education , multiculturalism , gun control , international and intercontinental trade , nato , local governments , conservative/liberal societal values ( family , human rights , traditions , religion ) , national industry , federal/state debt ... you know , the usual basics when it comes to european countries . 
  is there an english summary of each party 's positions somewhere ? 
  cool . 
  now show how much electricity they import from pro-nuclear countries . 
   so we need to ban russians too ? 
  i would totally be up for that . 
  if you take a walk through the centre of prague , you might wind up hearing more russian than czech . 
  not to mention the * massive * tax evading russian-owned businesses do . 
  uhh , no , poland is definitely closer to ukraine than to the czech republic . 
   brutal colonialists hah !, 
  you 've got to be kidding me mate . 
  new zealand is the prime example of how to assimilate the primitive indigenous population so that they benefit from it . 
  and yes , maori is spoken widely . 
  there even are maori media . 
  maoris had a huge leap forward in culture thanks to the colonisation . 
  kiwis are proud of how they live * with * maoris . 
  but hey , this is something completely irrelevant to how russians or soviets mess up any place they step into , especially when it comes to moral values . 
  nice deflection attempt though !, 
  yes , the czech republic is seeing the `` benefits '' of your `` brotherly help '' to this day .
