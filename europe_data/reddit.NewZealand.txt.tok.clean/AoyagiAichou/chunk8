  nah , the locals are just fine pissing in the streets themselves . 
  wow , i must have completely blanked the text . 
  whoops ... thanks for pointing that out !, 
  that one was not mentioned in the video though . 
  i guess it was n't all that important for the european parliament . 
  edit : apparently it 's the first thing in the video i somehow missed, 
  was n't that the point ? 
  to get and keep the foreigners out ? 
   hawkins says the uk is the only place she feels she can call home funny that she does n't have a british passport then . 
  well , i only live in the czech republic , but `` the way the european union behaves is starting to remind me of the totalitarian communist regime '' is a sentiment i hear quite often . 
   in a time where solar and wind have record falling prices oh please ... everything new is expensive , and this is * one * new plant . 
  solar power is still relatively new on this scale . 
  and you know what ? 
  in czech republic , the so-called `` solar barons '' sell watts for * 1500 % * of the market price . 
  and do n't even get me started on longevity or environmental impact ( in case of solars anyway ) , * or * reliability of the power . 
  and lastly , did you know that some , especially inland , countries can get much less sunlight than portugal , much less wind than uk , and much less running water than let 's say austria ? 
  oh , and yes , it 's cheaper , too . 
  stop living in that fantasy you speak of and do a [ 5 minute research ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=costs+of+nuclear+vs+solar ) . 
  haha , just ask them if they are european . 
  well , it 's not . 
  funny how ignorance can lead to a false sense of superiority , huh ? 
  why not both ? 
  well , that would suck . 
  aye , good for switzerland . 
  aaand i guess now we see that the moderation practices here are not exactly stellar . 
  let 's see how this does in comparison with [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5jpyqy/one_way_to_unite_europe/ ) gilded post ... 
  \\ # 28 is loaded as hell . 
  \\ # 42 is totally unclear . 
  am i responding to whether i like/hate the amount of influence ? 
  the fact that there is influence ? 
  the kind of influence ? 
  who wrote this ? 
  \\* shrug \\* i learned to not care about reddit karma since it 's based on mass mentality :p, 
  i was [ driving through switzerland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yiwdyty.jpg ), 
  oh , `` orthodox russians '' :d right , thanks for the explanation . 
  is n't milan kinda moving south though ? 
  yeah , i 've always preferred austrian or swiss cheese though :3, 
  so how much truth is in that car locking one ? 
  also ca n't you divide estonia by russian presence ? 
  in other words , let us dictate ( i.e. 
  pretend-negotiate ) what you are to do and you take it for your own . 
  brilliant !, 
   arguably it 's one way to minimize the impact of the inevitable fossil fuel use err ... 
  i 'm not sure what are you referring to . 
  co2 regulations/taxing ? 
   we should plainly focus on reducing car dependency overall . 
  heh , i do n't think that 's a goal attainable in this century . 
  people really like the freedom a car provides . 
  yea , but carbon dioxide is the least harmful by-product ( of those that are considered harmful to begin with ) . 
  brussels were the idiots who gave tax advantages to something as filthy as diesel , because they unfathomably thought that it 's cleaner than gasoline , were they not ? 
  funny that i learn about the country i live in from much closer to my homeland ... and yes , it 's great that there are institutions to fight against propaganda . 
  as long as it 's not abused ( something we will have to see in the future ) and as long as it 's balanced - and this certainly is not . 
  heh , that 's funny ( in a bitter way ) . 
  there 's a similar situation in the czech republic , but it concerns solar power plants instead . 
  the owners are called `` solar barons '' . 
  number of them faked starting of the plant 's operation to start before the ** massive ** state funding for solar energy ( so that it sells for 15 czk/kwh instead of like 1 czk/kwh , which is market electricity price ) . 
  in addition to that , many of those plans are being bought out by the chinese , who dumped their cheap solar panels on the market at the time ... as for nuclear `` waste '' disposal facilities , there was also a similar matter here . 
  the state nuclear safety authority was conducting some surveys . 
  when ( some ) people found out , there was a minor outrage , not dissimilar to what you describe ( because the surveys were n't public or consulted with the municipalities ) . 
  but then the czech `` nuclear hag '' ( that 's what she called herself ) , a popular director of the above-mentioned authority , said that these were just pre-pre-selection surveys to find out whether it 's worth even starting the process of selecting those places , which calmed most of the shouting voices down . 
  but , of course , almost nobody cares that most electricity comes from filthy coal ... 
  unfortunately , austria does n't seem to be doing that better . 
  although you have a much better starting position for going fully renewable . 
  what germany needs is a rational energy policy , not nuclearphobia . 
   just looking at that picture made me so depressed . . that 's what living in prague does . 
  i was n't aware `` morroccan '' was a race . 
  it 's their choice . 
  there 's a ton of job offers for waiters around all the time . 
  and do n't you realise that in many cases the waiters themselves smoke ? 
  yes , including at work . 
  nobody is doing that , pubs where smoking is allowed are private business in ( usually ) private property and nobody forces anyone to come there , * and * there is a comparatively large selection of non-smoking restaurants in every small town . 
  yes , freedom is very old fashioned , but that does n't make it bad . 
   you do n't realise how shit it is to be in smoke filled restaurants , pubs and clubs until it 's not their anymore and then you wonder why it was n't done years ago . 
  there already were many restaurants that banned smoking prior to this nonsense . 
  the independet at least has some actual news posts maybe with light commentary , but huffpo seems to do pure opinions . 
  the uk is still part of the actual eu . 
  in addition to that , lot of the british press fought vigorously against brexit and still do . 
  but no , i do n't live in the uk . 
  nor do i get my news from just one source or from one `` side '' ( like a lot of you lot seem to do ) . 
  uhh , i did n't want to outright say that you have * wrong * understanding of what `` negotiated '' means so that you could save face at least , but sure , it is wrong nonetheless . 
  thanks for being honest . 
  it 's potentially bad . 
  however , [ blocking `` hate speech '' ] ( https://www.yahoo.com/news/internet-giants-must-more-combat-hate-speech-says-184322012.html?ref=gs ) or something as non-specific is just bad in any case . 
  you have a strange understanding of what `` negotiated '' means . 
  well , that 's true , actually . 
  but i 'm not sure they mean it that way . 
  if they did , it would sort of imply malice from eu leadership ... and somehow i have a hard time imagining that , although i do n't discard that idea altogether . 
  there is no way of reliably knowing how is this going to develop economically and all the `` economists '' predicting doom and horror just because of how the referendum itself ended and the fluctuations afterwards have only proven that . 
  but yes , they 're taking a bloody long time . 
  maybe the gov ' t hopes something happens and/or the public pressure for re-referendum increases notably ? 
  actually i seem to have worded that incredibly poorly . 
  i meant * remain * in eu 's single market , of course . 
  whoops ... 
  but feel free to prove my incredible uneducatedness at any time . 
  well yes , remaining a part of the single market seems like against everything the pro-brexiters stood for . 
  at least may sounds like she intends to act according to that despite her not exactly being a fan of the idea ... that 's a sign of a uh ... worthy politician to me , as dumb as that sounds . 
  fta is what i understand under `` access to the single market '' . 
  `` you can sell your stuff here without tariffs and such , but it has to conform to our laws '' . 
  ah , those . 
  makes sense to exclude them , i guess .
