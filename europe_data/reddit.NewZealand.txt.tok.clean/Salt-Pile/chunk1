in what language is it spelt patwa ? 
  in patwa !, 
  i mean , it looks like it 's often spelt patwa * in * [ jamaican patois ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jamaican_patois ) itself . 
  ah , thanks for the explanation , that makes sense . 
  maybe it 's deductive reasoning for me too only at the opposite end of the scale . 
  i probably mangle french and german in a similar way to thousands of other english-speakers , so it 's a cinch to spot me , whereas my new zealand vowels probably make my equally broken attempts at , say , hungarian , a bit harder to place . 
   i think the australian accent \u0ca0_\u0ca0 seriously though that 's interesting . 
  maybe you are really good at speaking spanish , italian etc. 
  when i try those i definitely sound like english is my first language . 
  :-( edit 2 : sorry everyone , i second guessed myself , thought i was ninja editing and was n't and now it looks like replies to me make no sense . 
  the bit i cut out was about how germans and americans speaking english do n't have similar accents . 
  :-) those guys are our best ambassadors ever . 
  not sure , but as you can see from wikipedia 's chart on the [ variation in nz vowels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_zealand_english_phonology ) the more `` cultivated '' the nz accent , the closer it is to rp . 
  ( english has only been spoken in nz for 6-7 generations ) . 
  sam neill might be a bit on the posh side , so here are a couple more : [ law lecturer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjneadqbnic ) , [ politician ] ( https://youtu.be/kljiil9cgpi?t=22 ) and [ academic/poet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=518otwyegxq ) . 
  in the imperative form i think we 're talking about the implied subject not the object so it would be `` let ye be known '' , so still fun . 
  i checked and you 're right , not only is `` thineselves '' not even a word but it would n't be `` thine selves '' either , according to [ this ] ( https://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xthou.html ) the word is thyself , and i was probably thinking of the shakespearean phrase `` thine own self '' . 
  yes , i think it is down to familiarity . 
  i am terrible with accents from your region , because i do n't hear enough of them !, 
  new zealander here , in my ( limited ) experience , europeans can generally at least tell i am from the australasian region if i am speaking in english . 
  if i am attempting to speak in another language mileage varies . 
  in western europe people still generally pick me for australasian but in some other places i have found that people try about 3 other languages before finally asking if i have any english , whereas my american counterparts get spoken to in english straight off the bat . 
  i 'd be curious to know whether my experiences tally with the views of the europeans in this sub , though . 
  i just posted the nz accent upthread . 
   i do n't think i 've ever heard the new zealand accent . 
  you probably have , but did n't realise it . 
  here are my go-to clips for nz accents : [ educated nz accent ] ( https://youtu.be/d3fnrene14w?t=102 ) [ average nz accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecp419ktdi ) [ working class nz accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cgnmsictzs ) [ working class nz accent with maori inflection ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zakx5hwy1ki )  given how close they are nz and australia are about the same distance apart as minnesota and mexico , it 's just that there 's hardly anyone else in our area and we do have a lot of movement between countries . 
   also it would be `` let thee be known '' , but i 'm just a sad nitpicker another sad nitpicker here , this is interesting to me . 
  could you explain why ? 
  i do n't know much about it , and would have guessed that would mean `` let you be known '' ( singular , as opposed to plural * ye * ) ? 
  come to think of my instinct would be to phrase it let `` thineselves be known '' but that 's probably wrong too . 
  looks like the answer is a lot . 
  now i 'm wondering how many of us lurkers are like me and * not * from north america . 
   many rental apartments do not include a kitchen . 
  i think this is made possible by your tenant protection laws being so good . 
  over here , where the landlord can kick the tenant out with 90 days notice for no reason , raise the rent at will , and can even insist they do not hang up pictures on the wall , it would not be practical to keep moving the kitchen basics . 
  this is my favourite . 
  ours is `` were you born in a tent '' but i want to start using your one instead now . 
  perhaps she meant she would give good luck to your child - i mean , maybe it is good luck to be kissed by that particular woman ? 
  til , that 's quite strange to me - i mean , if we specifically do n't want people to drunk drive it makes more sense to have laws specifically against drunk driving . 
  great explanation , very clearly put . 
  thank you for this . 
  i am saving your comment so i can link to it in future . 
  ( also , dentists !, 
  ha ha ), 
  thanks . 
  yeah , sorry but you are . 
  this is r/askeurope . 
  i come to this sub to see what europeans have to say about their countries . 
  you and u/maximus _ galt - two americans arguing at length about america - is the kind of content i could find almost anywhere else on reddit . 
  i have to say , it would be kind of nice if you guys could respect the point of this sub . 
  that is so interesting !, 
  there must be something about garden centres . 
  in my country ( nz ) until this year , shops could not be open for statutory holidays but for some reason the garden centres in particular are well-known for deliberately breaking the rule and paying fines to the authorities . 
  at least your country recognises their special need !, 
  up until the end of the 1950s i think , it was certainly fashionable over here then so my grandmother and her friends had them in the 70s-80s , and even in the us where op is from , if you watch old 1950s movies the young women are wearing them in some scenes . 
  the term `` eugenics '' was invented by a british guy , [ francis galton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francis_galton ) , and there was definitely support for it in some circles . 
  people like george bernard shaw , the webbs and the fabian society etc as i recall . 
  i had n't heard of that ... and , googling to try to work out what the `` logic '' was behind it , i found the unsettling fact that some european countries still have this type of law . 
  france only changed theirs [ last year ] ( http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/14/13283086/transgender-law-france-sterilization-gender-change ) . 
  what surprised me was how some of these ideas continued long after the second world war , for instance as i now understand it , some forced sterilization of the roma was happening in parts of scandinavia for several decades later . 
  i had always been taught that these ideas were very 19th century ideas and then they were popular until ww2 , so i was taken aback when i started reading about these things . 
  i have been able to take them using birds . 
  i am feeling happy because i have spent enough time in this sub to know what lagom means . 
  ha ha . 
  no , it is a singular , long drawn out sound , in low voices , like `` shaaaaaaaaaaaaame '' . 
  i am not sure if it is permitted in the classroom nowadays but i still hear children say it in the street to one another to express that someone should feel ashamed . 
  yes , new zealander here , i have to admit i was thinking this `` jantelagen '' sounds a little familiar . 
  :-) i have a theory that this is why a number of `` celebrities '' like to visit our country , because culturally it is more difficult for us to act all excited or ask for their autograph ( i think because it could make someone too conceited ) . 
  edit : also , in some circles , if one child gets praised by a teacher , all the other children will chorus a word like `` shame '' to embarrass them . 
  they have this also in indonesia . 
  that 's really strange to me . 
  in new zealand , before we had lord of the rings tourism we had * the piano * tourism and i 'm pretty sure that was only the germans too . 
  ah , this sounds good . 
  i hope we get this . 
  at the moment we have annoying `` automated checkout '' terminals which are in a fixed location - we bring all the goods to it , scan them , bag them , and pay , but about 10 % of the time the machine becomes obsessed with what it calls `` unexpected item in bagging area '' ( usually there is nothing there , this is just a delusion it suffers ) so we have to wait and get a human . 
  that 's so funny , when he said `` the movie '' i thought the movie he was talking about * was * tora tora tora . 
  only when reading your comment i remembered there was a hollywood film ( which i did n't bother to see ) . 
  you are not allowed to catch salmon without a license over here , is it the same there or just the handling part ? 
  your comment has solved a mystery for me . 
  when i was in hungary i was puzzled because i had thought it would be obvious that i am an english-speaker from my terrible attempts at hungarian and bad accent , but no one seemed to think i would be able to speak english at all ( they would usually try russian and french first ) . 
  not sure about australia . 
  the closest we come to it in new zealand is `` munter '' or `` underclass '' ( we have bogans here too but that 's more cultural than socio-economic - it 's about taste in music , clothing etc and there are rich bogans too ) . 
  right wing pundits speak of a `` feral underclass '' of people on welfare . 
  the thing is , western / european-descent society in nz has no history of agrarian peasants in the way europe has . 
  ( traditional maori society had slaves and aristocracy and such , but all that was disrupted by colonization and the new arrivals from europe did n't slot into the pre-existing framework ) . 
  i 'm going to start writing idiot/peasant as my occupation when i fill out forms . 
  ha , we have [ a more boring version of this same thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fairy_bread ) in my part of the world too . 
  we call it `` fairy bread '' and it is only for children . 
  good idea for a thread op !, 
  i am enjoying this . 
  thank you for this . 
  i have seen and liked half of the movies you recommend , so will definitely look for the others . 
  ah , this is interesting , i wondered if dutch themselves would recommend this ( given verhoeven 's hollywoodness ) . 
  i enjoyed it a lot . 
  hmm , people who need legal marijuana and euthanasia do not want to move to new zealand either , because neither of those things is legal here . 
  perhaps if you had mentioned that in your initial post people would n't have jumped on you . 
  it would n't occur to most people . 
  if you think that the main reason so many people think they would like to move to nz is because they would like to hang out with indigenous maori , that sentiment does you credit , but sadly you 're under a misapprehension . 
  i think your link might lead to the wrong post ?
