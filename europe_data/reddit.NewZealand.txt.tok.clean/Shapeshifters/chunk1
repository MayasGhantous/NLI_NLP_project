1840s was when irish people spread across the world . 
  do you see parallels with first nation / aboriginal / maori with the history of displacement , stuck in generational cycles of poverty and violence , lack of schools in their own language ? 
  how can segregation get any worse ?!, 
  primary school education in their own language would get them some skills , some exposure to ideas beyond the ghetto and thier own tribe . 
  learning maths , science , social studies in any language would also give them some chance in french secondary school . 
  mother tongue primary schools are used in similar marginalised communities in new zealand , india and parts of africa . 
  otherwise the kids first experience of learning is that they do n't belong and it is not for them . 
  are schools teaching in their own language ? 
  primary schools in the children 's language could help get them started in a real life . 
  is vaccination unusual in europe ? 
  we all got tb vaccinations at school . 
  it often leaves a little dot scar on the arm just below the shoulder . 
  roma gypsies . 
  see the other thread today - mention roma and / r/europe goes mental racist . 
  european nato membership is n't shown . 
  jesus and mo to the rescue !, 
  mossad have been caught using fake nz , australian , canadian and uk passports too . 
  the movie 's kazak scenes were filmed in romania . 
  it is always grey and raining in communist countries , and always bright and sunny in western democratic countries . 
  we learnt this at school : /, 
  `` another source of revenue in tonga has been the sale of tongan passports . 
  this was the brainchild of a hong kong chinese man , one george chen , who was asked by the tongan king for advice on how to raise revenue . 
  `` sell passports , '' chen said , knowing that many would be sought after by hong kongers who were watching with horror the approach of the people 's republic takeover of the british colony in 1997 . 
  for $ 10,000 , someone who was otherwise stateless could become a tongan protected person ( t.p.p. ), 
  and carry a tonga passport , which conferred the freedom to travel to any country in the world except tonga , where a t.p.p. 
  was forbidden to settle . 
  when some countries rejected the validity of these passports , the king was informed and a new tongan passport went on sale for $ 20,000 ( or $ 35,000 for a family of four ) . 
  this gave the holder tongan nationality and a right to settle . 
  south africans and libyans as well as hundreds of hong kong chinese were quick to snap up these passports . 
  imelda marcos bought one , and in the process became a tongan citizen . 
  in the past seven years this has produced $ 30 million for tonga as well as a constitutional crisis . 
  angry tongans demonstrated their opposition to the sale of tongan nationality , called for limitations on the king 's powers ( he was the one to approve the whole thing ) and demanded to know what had happened to the money . '', 
  yes , we were all just colonies of london , supplying cheap labour , food and quaint scenery for tourists from the city . 
  also their are groups overlapping across many of these borders , and groups such as muslim and roma that have some cross-border cultural or even separatist ideals . 
  good point . 
  texas is free to leave the us too , iirc . 
  the freedom to devalue our currency is another factor , and it is interesting that economic interests rather than separatist interests may yet divide europe again . 
  seriously , most of you guys all have the same currency and the same passports , and no restriction on travel , and multlple languages used in the same are already . 
  what is the big deal about being a separate `` country '' in the euro zone ? 
  what practical difference would it make to most people , really ? 
  if you travel outside europe you 'll find you 've more in common with each other than with me . 
  on the other hand , why not recognise these areas as cultural identities and let each fly their new flag . 
  on this map they show syria as being in europe , which is silly because syria is really in asia . 
  asia starts at the bosphorus , in turkey . 
  ** seriously odd maps ** here . 
  does this make any sense to you ? 
  syria is in europe the country that went to war with britain has the most english-speakers in south america . 
  so send some to the malvinas and make babies not war . 
  belize does n't feature , but then belize does n't know if they speal english or a kriol undifferentiated from english . 
  nepal has the gurkhas serving in the british army , plus thousand of english-speaking tourist workers , but apparently not enough to register on this map . 
  the phillipines has call-centres serving english-speaking countries , and it is an official language , and a former us colony , and this http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/business-english pakistan seems to have fallen into a void , somewhere between asia and the middle east , although to most people in england `` pakistani '' and `` asian '' are synonyms . 
  apart from all that , most interesting . 
  carry on . 
  i 'd love to see a map of yes/aye/si / oui/ja - the verbal upvote sound that people make when listening . 
  this sound is often the first thing i notice when watching a group of european tourists and wondering where they are from . 
  some english regional accents use `` aye '' , or used to , and english speakers can often guess the speaker 's region or colonial country just from hearing them say `` yes '' . 
  australia tried this with aboriginal children and it was a disaster , genocide effectively , as it eliminates the culture . 
  see the long version here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stolen_generations australia also had poor british children , resettled in australia , and told their biogical parents died . 
  that turned out to be a horrible social engineering experiment in hindsight . 
  north indians have a milk-based cuisine . 
  butter chicken , holy cows , a dairy on every corner etc. 
  ... and to turn the telly off in the ad break until the kettle boils . 
  airlift in an emergency supply of vowels from ouagadougou or maui , hawaii . 
  ... and in other news [ ikea are going to sell solar panels ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nfthi/swedish_flatpack_furniture_giant_ikea_will_start/ ) which wo n't help at all unless the sun shines during the ad breaks . 
  gouda , edam , maasdam , and komijnekaas . 
  all the best hard cheese styles are from the netherlands . 
  only 3680 km and 40 hours driving time from brussels . 
  probably a cognate . 
  austronesian languages were heading off into polynesia about the time indo-european was heading across india , around 2000 bce . 
  is the [ hackney marshes campsite ] ( http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/81/61/2816153_1e01c665.jpg ) suitable for young people on way to their job at the un ? 
  hard currency was regulated in those days in many countries , and governments forced overseas visitors to stay in specific places , pay in hard currency , pay in advance of arriving in some cases , list all the hotels on the visa application , register passports with the local police every night and so on . 
  new zealand did similar ridiculous things until 1982 to keep money in the country . 
  yes , and do n't they look like [ these ] ( https://cultofotis.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/lost-cat-poster-patches-2.jpg ) ? 
  :-) i remember it was so much more expensive than western europe that we got on the train to munich after a few days . 
  it was more expensive than the uk . 
  i was earning good money in london , # 10/hour for software engineering , and a weekend in wales cost about # 20 a night . 
  do bulgarians still put up posters and photos of dead friends ? 
  there were all these posters on power poles that looked like the ones we do for missing pets . 
  at first i thought the communist police might have abucted all these missing people . 
  in 1988 i walked across the border from from turkey , got to sophia by public transport and got sent to stay in a private apartment . 
  the apartment block , the street and the suburb all seemed to be one huge suburb of identical concrete , like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people%27s_republic_of_bulgaria#/media/file:mladost3.jpg ) . 
  we were naive new zealand backpackers and did n't get to see much of the countryside , acommodation for foreigners was expensive . 
  as are native hawaiians in hawaii !, 
  the common factor ? 
  you . 
  bangladesh has 1033 people per km ^ 2 , that is , 10 people per hectare . 
  yeah , it happened here and in australia too . 
  overrun with squatters , europeans , pirates , starving irish and war refugees . 
  a few arrived about 1840 and then millions more , and they 've taken over the whole southern hemisphere . 
  finland is comparable to new zealand land area and population . 
  arable land vs agriculture land seems to be a big difference . 
  south korea has a lot less arable land . 
  has it more forests than the uk ? 
  til * obnubilate * past tense : obnubilated ; past participle : obnubilated darken or cover with or as if with a cloud ; obscure .

  gollum is essential to our tourist economy . 
  both of our flightless kiwi airforce planes are getting airworthy to deal with this challenge to gollum 's beauty, 
  yes , huntly . 
  the kind of place the intercity bus stops .
