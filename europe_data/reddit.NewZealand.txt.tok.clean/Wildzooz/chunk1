there is an inevitable outcome to this if crossing into austria becomes more difficult for migrants and the traffickers . 
  they will search for an alternative route to go from hungary to germany , and the most direct route will be through slovakia and the czech republic . 
  i expect to see an increase in the number of migrants passing through bratislava and prague as a result , including camping around the train stations . 
  given the strong anti-immigrant xenophobia expressed in both countries recently this could lead to attacks on migrants in transit .

  [ lanarch castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/larnach_castle ) near dunedin is the closest to where i 'm from in nz , though [ bouzov castle ] ( http://www.veteranmuseum.cz/olomouc/wp-content/uploads/image/bouzov218.jpg ) in cz is the closest to my current location . 
  you are aware that there are at least ten different places in europe that have claimed to be the true `` centre of europe '' over the years ? 
  bernotai built a new and bigger monument than most of the other places , so it gets more attention at the moment . 
  i 've also visited `` centre of europe '' monuments in slovakia and ukraine , and there are many others . 
  calculating the geographical centre can be done in many different ways , depending on if you include all the small outer islands in the far north and in the atlantic , where the line dividing europe from asia is drawn in russia , etc. 
  see [ more details here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geographical_midpoint_of_europe ), 
  i went to plovdiv and veliko tarnovo a few years ago , terrific places . 
  tryavna and koprivshtitsa also had great bulgarian national revival architecture . 
  hiking in the rila mountains was another highlight . 
  i love andrei tarkovsky 's films , especially * stalker * and * solaris * . 
  anton chekhov 's works are terrific , and who does n't enjoy playing tetris ? 
  the full truth will probably never be known , but the conclusion that masaryk was thrown out of his bathroom window seems almost as possible as that he decided to jump . 
  the kremlin and gottwald needed to remove him and make a public statement about those who might try to oppose the new regime . 
  gunmen may have arrived in his apartment that night and he was either forced to jump or he decided to jump rather than be shot . 
  he had planned to leave for britain the following day , and would have continued to be a thorn in the side of the government . 
  you can watch a [ film of masaryk 's funeral procession through the streets of prague ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv-ozhupru8 ) , edvard bene\u0161 looks incredibly sad and broken during the ceremony . 
  for the czechs in the room , this sounds like a list of inventions that [ j\u00e1ra cimrman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a1ra_cimrman ) would have created when he took some time off from helping eiffel with his tower , helping edison with his light bulb , showing mendeleev how to fix his periodic table , etc. 
  truly the greatest czech of all time ... 
  actually , i reached my peak as a tetris player at age 13 playing it on game boy . 
  top score over 500 000 . 
  i remember playing ice hockey while drunk on an outdoor moscow skating rink , that definitely improved my goal scoring motivation . 
  i was already a vodka expert after krakow , 
  * when i lived in bratislava : * almost no one in nz or canada had any idea where it is ( travel agents included ) , and saying `` in slovakia '' would elicit reactions like `` oh , is n't there still a war going on there ? 
  we send peacekeeping soldiers there , right ? '', 
  i got used to saying `` czechoslovakia '' simply to avoid confusion . 
  * when i lived in prague : * prague has more name brand recognition in canada/nz than czech republic does , and for canadians jaromir jagr has an even higher name recognition even if they do n't know where he 's from . 
  * when i lived in krakow : * everyone in nz/canada has heard of poland , but few could find it on a map . 
  i remember being asked if i was there as an aid worker . 
  * when i lived in moscow : * everyone has heard of moscow before , but telling people i was living there would get reactions like `` are you crazy ? '', 
  or `` are you a secret agent ? '', 
  and the assumption that i must have become an expert in vodka varieties and playing tetris . 
  41 in total - i 've lived in czech republic , slovakia & poland : albania , armenia , austria , belarus , belgium , bosnia & herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , czech republic , denmark , estonia , finland , france , georgia , germany , greece , hungary , ireland , italy , kosovo , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , macedonia , moldova , montenegro , netherlands , poland , portugal , romania , russia , serbia , slovakia , slovenia , spain , sweden , switzerland , turkey , ukraine , uk , vatican city . 
  took me nine attempts before i got all 24 . 
  a lot of guesswork required for maltese and the finno-ugric & baltic languages , but i 'm familiar with all the slav and romance ones . 
  it 's a good challenge , i 'd like to try it again with other words . 
  slovakia ( from a bratislava perspective ) : people from z\u00e1horie region ( north of bratislava near the border with cz ) are considered to be simple-minded idiots without any education , the region is the butt of many common jokes people who live in the far east of the country ( especially if they 're east of ko\u0161ice ) do nothing but drink , and nobody lives there anymore besides grandmothers and grandfathers because all the young people have moved to blava , prague or the uk, 
  are you from tampere ? 
  i hear students from tampere go to turku and jump up and down in the central square in an effort to make the city sink into the sea more quickly ... 
  favourite cities i 've lived in : bratislava , prague , krakow favourite cities to visit : l'viv , tallinn , lisbon , sibiu , bern , wroc\u0142aw , olomouc , ljubljana,

  it 's the middle of winter here in new zealand , be happy that it 's summer !, 
  could you please provide a link for this interview ? 
  ( i can read czech ), 
  island ( used in \u010cesk\u00fd jazyk and many other european languages ) is spelled ` iceland ' in english . 
  i agree though , a default by greece would mean entering uncharted waters never sailed during iceland 's experience with default and subsequent recovery . 
  there are at least three places in romania that have their name written on a hilltop in hollywood-style white letters like that , brasov , rasnov and deva . 
  it 's shameless tourist promotion , but yeah it looks really unoriginal and a bit tacky . 
  ah , that explains it about the beer . 
  learning other languages is always easiest in the pub  ` nech sa p\u00e1\u010di ' is definitely what a shopkeeper would say in that context , it 's an unusual expression . 
  why does asking for two large beers in slovak sound strange to polish ears ? 
  i speak slovak but do n't know any polish . 
  is it the word \u010dapovan\u00e9 ? 
  also the expression ` co sie patrzy ' was probably ` nech sa p\u00e1\u010di ' , which is basically ` what can i do for you ' in that context . 
  i ca n't access that link from here in nz . 
  you mean [ this szczecin logo with the name in phonetic script ? 
  ] ( http://sz-n.com/2012/11/szczecinstettin%cb%88%ca%83t%ca%83et%ca%83i%cb%90n-whats-in-a-name/ ) the article discusses the pronunciation problem for english speakers . 
  i wonder if wroc\u0142aw or szczecin have made similar tv ads/slogans to promote themselves . 
  it 's much harder to think of a catchy slogan that rhymes with these words , 
  shooty is my hero , i 've been reading his cartoons for years . 
  certainly one of europe 's most talented cartoonists . 
  i love how he draws robert fico with his long red tie and devilish face !, 
  yes , wa\u0142\u0119sa is a good example of the ' \u0142 ' together with ' \u0119 ' challenge of pronunciation . 
  a few years ago \u0141\u00f3d\u017a produced an international tv advertisement for business and tourist promotion , it was shown frequently on bbc and cnn in europe . 
  the end of the ad asked the question of potential tourists `` would you be surprised how it 's spelled ? 
  would you ? 
  in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ? '', 
  [ here 's the ad on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtnyaj7qncq ) . 
  they clearly realized that the pronunciation of the name was a problem for international recognition . 
  cities in countries that use the cyrillic alphabet do n't have this problem , because the transliteration into latin alphabet characters uses a recognizable form of pronunciation . 
  yes , the ' \u0105 ' and ' \u0119 ' sounds can be hard to get right when speaking , especially in combination with ' \u0142 ' . 
  the ` szcz ' consonant cluster is also quite challenging at first . 
  i think many polish place names are hard , szczecin and przemy\u015bl are two that took me a long time to learn properly . 
  but i still think the boat city , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , has the biggest challenge to build international name recognition because the pronunciation is not at all what foreigners expect ( ` lawds ' ) , so different that they get totally confused . 
  i 've heard tourists in krak\u00f3w train station asking for tickets to ` row-claw ' ( wroc\u0142aw ) leading to great confusion , that 's what i thought of when i started this thread . 
  the ` trz ' is a little tricky , so something like ` tch-na-del ' . 
  the other one is easier , ` po-klon-skva ' . 
  even english speaking children have problems with english pronunciation . 
  when i was a child i pronounced ` colonel ' as ` call-oh-nell ' and ` relatives ' as 're - * late * - ivs ' . 
  it takes us years as children to learn how to spell properly because it 's so random , you have to learn each word individually . 
  how did you pronounce mustache before ? 
   those two place names do look tricky , but ... ` shcheb-zhesh-een ' and ` bzhench-kovitseh ' . 
  i actually lived and worked in opole , polska for six months so my pronunciation is better than most foreigners , 
  you 're lucky to find it so easy to pronounce things like that . 
  of course english has it 's own crazy pronunciation issues , at least polish spelling is logical , 
  i do n't think that 's too difficult to pronounce , certainly not compared to some hungarian and polish place names . 
  i 've been trying to learn hungarian pronunciation for years and still ca n't get it right . 
  you have to be born with it . 
  is that a czech place name ? 
  i did n't know it was possible to start a russian word with ' \u044b ' , i 've never seen it before . 
  is \u042b\u0433\u044b\u0430\u0442\u0442\u0430 a word in buryat or tatar ? 
  no vowels is fun . 
  at least it 's a short word . 
  one of the most beautiful and historic towns in \u0411\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f .
