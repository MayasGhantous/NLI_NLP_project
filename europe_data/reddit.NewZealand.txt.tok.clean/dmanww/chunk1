does n't it just, 
  [ here , i 'll show you ] ( https://economics.rabobank.com/global/publicatie%20afbeeldingen/2014/04%20april/estonia/estionia3.png ) about 25 % of the total population of estonia is ethnic russian . 
  in [ ida-viru county ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ida-viru_county ) it is about 73 % after estonian independence in 1991 , ethnic russians were not given citizenship unless they passed an estonian language test . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_estonia#current_situation ) there was also a minor border dispute with russia that was settled in feb 2014 . 
  this all can fit in very well into putin 's playbook . 
  problem is , estonia is in eu and nato . 
  i do n't think this will stop putin seeing how far he can get . 
  how far could he get ? 
  of course , estonia says [ their russians are not like ukrainian russians . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/minister-with-russian-ethnicity-says-estonians-still-united-a-963003.html ) should we worry about it next week ? 
  probably not . 
  but we 'll see what comes out of the war on isis . 
  you joke , but there is a region of estiona in the north east that is majority russian . 
  it think there were also some citizenship issues there . 
  added to wishlist . 
  thanks, 
  you could say the same thing about australia or any country that has been settled by immigrants relatively recently . 
  defining nations is a touchy subject . 
  but i wanted to make the point that a nation = / = country . 
  in general , a nation-state would encompass a majority population , but you will likely still have pockets of other identities . 
  in the end , you might need a conflict to unify a country into a single identity . 
  us had it with the us revolutionary war and war of 1812 to separate from the uk . 
  even then , after the british withdrew following the revolution , there were many loyalists who moved to canada , which was still british . 
  that 's pretty much the point i was making . 
  it also allows for the distinction between nationalism and patriotism . 
  you 're describing a nation , not a country . 
  this should be in / r/trainporn, 
  same kind of people are attracted to it . 
  well obviously . 
  but it seems to show the calculus has changed . 
  it may come when they negotiate terms with the separatists . 
  ukraine govt has a similar but more precarious situation around getting a win . 
  they 've killed their own citizens to beat these guys . 
  they have to make it look like it was worth something . 
  i think these are the top priorities for russia . 
  - normalization of crimea situation . 
  - guarantees of limiting involvement with nato/eu . 
  - binding economic contracts - federalization of ethnic russian areas . 
  unfortunately , these are the opposite of what ukraine wants to do . 
  not sure what they could give up for russia to feel it got a win . 
  damn you lactose tolerant freak, 
  and neo-soviet too, 
  it 's just a coincidence that the crash site is between the two major separatists centers . 
  in the area the ukrainian army is currently making decent progress . 
  uncle adolf would [ disagree ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_lie ), 
  this is pretty interesting in terms of timing . 
  the last couple of days , there has been talk of removing support from separatists based on certain conditions . 
  does that mean putin thinks they are no longer the best way to reach his goals ? 
  either way , it seems he 'll now have a poison spear in ukraine 's side which he will twist when he 's sees fit . 
  even if ukraine manages to shut down the current separatists , they 'll have to deal with interference for a while . 
  my worry is that they will turn more paranoid , nationalistic and authoritarian because of it . 
  not a good direction . 
  this would look quite nice printed, 
  there 's always / r/worldnews, 
  was there something about canceling the poland celebration in russia ? 
  is it a big deal ? 
  i guess it makes it easier to interpret in 100 years . 
  make way !, 
  science coming though . 
  there is also a matter of scale france is aprox 65mil people , netherlands is 17mil [ map of where they came from ] ( https://twitter.com/justhovensgreve/status/491280878036078593/photo/1 ), 
  repost to / r/autos ? 
  no swamp germans ? 
  g\u00f6tze ripped it wide open, 
  [ here you go ] ( http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/crayon-sun-burst-light-airy-fun-hand-drawn-star-characteristics-30748734.jpg ), 
  swords into plowshares and back . 
  interesting . 
  thanks . 
  done and done . 
  germany goal !!, 
  getting rid of your citizenship is indeed quite difficult . 
  [ a ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-01-10/guest-post-how-i-renounced-my-us-citizenship-and-why-part-1 ) [ b ] ( http://www.emirates247.com/news/i-accidentally-became-a-us-citizen-and-cannot-get-rid-of-the-passport-2013-11-23-1.528931 ) us does not recognize dual-citizenship . 
  if you get us citizenship , you have to renounce all other citizenships . 
  you can get them back if the other country allows it . 
  all us citizens need to file a tax return , you may not need to pay anything , but you still have to file . 
  some countries have double-taxation agreements , which credit the tax paid in your country of residence . 
  the germans are obviously still watching the game . 
  i was born in russia and came to the us as a kid in the 80s . 
  i now have us citizenship but this is one of the reasons i 'm hesitant to go back . 
  `` hi there , congratulations you now have your russian citizenship back , are n't you glad . 
  did we mention we have conscription . 
  good luck '', 
  seriously , never had tea ? 
  i like earl grey because it 's kind of sweet by itself . 
  i do n't drink it with milk or sugar , but that 's just my thing . 
  if you 've never had tea i 'd try to recommend going to a tea store to try out what good tea should taste like . 
  part of it is brewing . 
  it will get bitter and nasty if it sits too long . 
  what city do you live in ? 
  will the oil info affect the independence voting ? 
  i think it 's way too early to tell . 
  the legislative elections are n't even over . 
  not sure who would run against her in the primaries . 
  i just realized if hillary gets elected the puns will be unending, 
  i got australia in the pool at work . 
  oh well still get $ 10 if they come in dead last . 
  my yakov smirnoff books will be relevant again !, 
  in russia we have saying . 
  woman is like bus . 
  that 's it . 
  you kid , but georgia happened during the olympics opening ceremony .
