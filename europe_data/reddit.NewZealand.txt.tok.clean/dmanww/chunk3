  ca n't see it , but i 'm going to pretend it 's the scene from eurotrip, 
  more like computer science, 
  true , and the name is n't helping . 
  ucav was a better description, 
  that 's just the name that stuck . 
  they 're not autonomous , but those are coming, 
  some tools are themselves bad ( flechettes ) or are prone to being abused ( mines ), 
  thugs just need some form of authority to hide behind . 
  `` it 's not so great britain . '', 
  ha comedians, 
  sure , here 's your fortified gruel . 
  enjoy, 
  it is in ca, 
  nz also lacks poisonous animals and it 's slightly warmer, 
  i wonder if it 's something about foreign rules . 
  i think us companies had something similar . 
  under `` camel rental '', 
  the germans bypassed a rule ? 
  i do n't know it was possible, 
  temperature, 
  i live in new zealand . 
  i have n't touched cash in months . 
  checking in from nz . 
  [ 10c 20c 50c $ 1 $ 2 ] ( https://inquisitivebird.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/new-zealand-2006-circulating-coins.jpg ) that 's it . 
  here 's the [ ballot from nz ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/new_zealand_mmp_voting_paper.jpg ), 
  i 'm a bit rusty on my soviet military insignia . 
  air force lt colonel . 
  the medal was one of his [ orders of the red star ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/order_of_the_red_star ), 
  ( i am not sure ) = good that you remembered . 
  i ironed the kitel ( uniform jacket ) , medals are with me, 
  ai n't no guilt trip , like a grandma guilt trip . 
  those have had a slightly more strained relationship with russia in the last couple years, 
  the autopilot was set to 30m, 
  i should do one for me too . 
  we even have an aldi here . 
  did n't he just call a snap election ? 
  now there was an [ explosion near stockholm ] ( http://m.theage.com.au/world/blast-hits-turkish-building-in-sweden-20160217-gmx1dp.html ) next to a turkish social centre, 
  so which of these things did these women not follow ? 
  that 's berlin, 
  no the other one . 
  the one with the theses and a hammer, 
  let 's not get started on cricket, 
  sounds like my grandpa when he 's drunk, 
  now compare this with english language skills, 
  yep . 
  total population of nz is about 4.5 m ( about half of london ) . 
  land area about 10 % more than uk . 
  the ferry takes rain cars , so yeah . 
  i think the main issue is it does n't seem worth it . 
  most of the population is up in auckland . 
  and the entire south island only makes up about 1/4 of the population of the country and the main center ( pop 366k ) is 300km south of the ferry landing . 
  wellington to blenheim . 
  avrerage abuot 130m deep, 
   that means people could live in one and commute into other for work daily , if necessary so like the \u00d8resund bridge ? 
  that 's about 85km . 
  it 's only about 65km between north and south island in nz . 
  but do n't sell enough milk to pay for it . 
  i was thinking of the [ la prison ] ( http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/09/15/twin_towers_wide-628b60a6d9d215b28bc7111613ad9431d0db601b-s900-c85.jpg ), 
  an opportunity to test the weapons and tactics used in ww2, 
  did n't erdogan himself say he was going to `` cleanse '' the military, 
  looks like a prison, 
  i see a lot of theories that the us was behind this . 
  but why not putin , would make much more sense . 
  it was worse than poorly planned . 
  they misread public opinion . 
  but it sounded like there were going to be more purges of the military so they probably figured it was now or never . 
  tanks shooting at parliament building in ankara ? 
  was that the missing one ? 
  anyone in addition to the armed security guard ? 
  maybe it 's just that the clutch pedal needed to be next to the transmission back in the day . 
  here 's a [ description ] ( http://history.house.gov/exhibitions-and-publications/house-chamber/rostrum/ ) it has a part about symbolism . 
  because the implication is that they were run by the polish , rather than calling them nazi death camps ( in poland ) . 
  some of these can get you a mean look , and some will start a war . 
  [ us house of representatives ] ( http://historycms.house.gov/assets/15032423351.asset ) i think they were added in 1951 , but someone could correct me . 
  no worries , we 'll send the 20 guys we can spare . 
  i wonder if people can id most of them . 
  the pistol with the stock is a [ vp70 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heckler_%26_koch_vp70 ) . 
  the first polymer-framed pistol, 
  that 's bs . 
  companies refuse business all the time . 
  some times it 's [ luxury companies ] ( http://www.carscoops.com/2016/08/car-collector-sues-ferrari-for-not.html ) . 
  sometimes [ not so much ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/09/northern-ireland-belfast-bakers-would-have-sinned-ashers-bakery-gay-marriage-cake ) . 
  only a day after us . 
  going to be a fun weekend . 
  [ shudder ], 
  is n't there a starbucks across the street from the french embassy ? 
  they look like little piles of poop, 
  i have a friend who is a physicist and trained in switzerland . 
  he 's in new zealand now and is n't exactly happy with the level of r&d, 
  after looking at those , open platforms look downright 19th century . 
  would probably keep the stations much cleaner, 
  will be easier once there is more external pressure . 
  by then it will be a tougher fight . 
  right , let 's make it easy . 
  it 's europe against the bics . 
  i think us has minimum sentencing . 
  especially for drug offences . 
  someone can probably correct this if i 'm wrong, 
  i think i 've [ found ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqq6z-hmaqy ) the problem, 
  being a terrorist actually has some repercussions .
