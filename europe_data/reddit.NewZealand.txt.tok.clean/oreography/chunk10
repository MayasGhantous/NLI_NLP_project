  the `` stealing our jobs '' narrative is false in skilled industries , but amongst unskilled work if a large pool of migrants are willing to work for minimum wage and put up with poorer conditions , then statistically the number of jobs available to unskilled native workers can decrease significantly . 
  al jazeera is equal parts right wing `` ban islam '' stupidity and equal parts arab stupidity . 
  i saw all sorts of crap in the wake of charlie hebdo `` allah will be angry . 
  we luv our prophet , u cant draw him '' on an isis leader being killed there were people saying he would reach jannah as well , and calling for the west to suffer .

  this only works if you 're an even more obscure minority or sexual identity than she is . 
  i 'm sorry , britannia triggers my colonial oppression ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ something . 
  please use less problematic phrasing . 
  now now hellas , we all know you have ulterior motivations for turk bashing . 
  but the bacon tastes so delicious, 
  wtf . 
  iceland should have won . 
  this is a travesty !,

  you 're really ruining the stereotype of the angry scotsman for me ,, 
  it seems pretty crazy from what i saw of it from a channel 4 series , more lewd than ibiza . 
  exactly , if non eu immigrants just included skilled immigrants from oceania , east asia and north america then nobody would be objecting . 
  however everyone assumes that it 's all refugees, 
  tfw nobody gets my dank puns, 
  nice is an understatement, 
  c'est ma poster preferee en / r/europe !, 
  have you been to portugal too ? 
  apparently the north and galicia in your country are all beautiful areas . 
  i support you in your efforts to get banned, 
  i found this hilarious http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/20/britain-criminally-stupid-race-immigration?cmp=emcneweml6619i2, 
  i mean like most social justice concepts it 's well intentioned , and necessary in certain contexts e.g a meeting for survivors of domestic abuse , war veterans with ptsd etc. 
  but if you ignore the context and attempt to apply it everywhere , it lacks any purpose and can cause more harm than good . 
  `` those to the left of me : a buncha hippies . 
  those to the right of me : a buncha nutjobs '', 
  if you take position to that extremity , then segregation can end up being the goal http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/aeman-ansari/ethnic-safe-spaces_b_6897176.html, 
  of course , best buddy hitler was n't too sympathetic to the plight of the eastern europeans , given that he wanted to wipe most of the pole 's and slav 's out anyways . 
  then why imply that those opposed to mass immigration are right winged as you did in your comment above ? 
  it is not an irrational fear when looking at the situation in practical terms . 
  these migrants have little to zero education , terrible literacy rates , an opposing culture and frequently an opposing religion to the majority of europe . 
  they use public services and welfare disproportionately higher than any eu citizen , costing the host countries more . 
  in britain , over a decade , non eea migrants ( including wealthier immigrants that offset the balance of refugees ) `` each took out about # 21,000 more than they put in during that period . 
  `` http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25880373 aside from on grounds of compassion and humanitarianism , there is no practical benefit to letting in these migrants . 
  my account is 4 years old , has 30k + comment karma and i mod a large private sub as well as / r/nzcirclejerk and / r/irishcirclejerk . 
  also moderated / r/circlejerk for a very brief period . 
  i am on reddit daily and more often than i should be ** do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox ) ? 
  ** i am a web design student , so can easily work on the css . 
  ** what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  ** my timezone is gmt + 12 new zealand time . 
  this means i 'm able to moderate for all visitors in the asia pacific region including : australians , singaporeans , chinese , japanese etc. 
  ** what is your favorite/least favorite thing about / r/europe ** my favourite thing is how well posters from different european countries get along . 
  my least favourite is the general hivemind that has developed here , as does in every large sub . 
  ** what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  ** i think it 's a pretty great sub at the moment , but it would n't hurt to have more moderating for raids and user squabbles . 
  ** what would make you a good moderator ? 
  ** i have experience with web design/css and i am able to moderate users at times when other european and american mods are n't . 
  i believe i am able to take an impartial stance when moderating and chiefly focus on the rules on the sub , and not take positions in user squabbles . 
  beautiful, 
  note , i by no means agree with them . 
  their argument is that it 's more to do with preserving european culture . 
  they feel that non european immigrants do not have the history or ties to this continent , or the european cultural background and so will end up eroding european culture . 
  of course so long as immigration in small numbers , this simply is n't true . 
  however i do believe that with larger scale immigration , the immigrants will not adopt european customs and instead will begin to demand that countries conform to their culture .

  and totalitarianism is socialism right ? 
  actually post korean war , north korea had a stronger economy than the south for at least a decade . 
  fascists want to no scope the immigrants !, 
  it 's more a codeword for wealthy people is n't it . 
  there 's just the correlation because white majority countries are generally wealthier . 
  a chinese immigrant from canada would usually be called an expat as well . 
  except for tripe, 
  i think he understood , but he just wanted to make a cheap joke at your expense . 
  in general : people in first world countries are reluctant to move , because they 're satisfied where they live and are immersed in the local culture . 
  seriously ? 
  it 's probably the most famous tourist attraction in ireland . 
  i agree with your point that trading between nations would have been much better than colonialism , but unfortunately with a lack of cultural understanding , colonialism often occurred in place of trade . 
  this was the case in china where the emperor rebuffed all the british advances and confined them to trading in a small area in canton . 
  this outraged the british and led to the opium wars and the secession of hong kong . 
  likewise in africa and australia , the modern methods of property rights and trade were foreign to the native peoples . 
  compare how aboriginals were treated to the maori 's in new zealand , which signed a treaty with the british ensuring their land rights . 
  they already had fortifications , trade between tribal groups and private property and willingly adopted british customs and technology , which made their colonial experience a lot less painful than elsewhere . 
  i think you 're mistaking africans with gorillas . 
  africans had huts and forms of shelter , they also had fortresses in places like zimbabwe and mali as well . 
  have you read up on the meiji restoration ? 
  the americans ( not the british ) went to japan and demanded it was opened up for trade . 
  under the meiji emperors rule , the centuries of isolationism ended and modern western technology came to japan . 
  there was little subjugation in the case of japan , which was largely why they emerged as one of the great powers in the 20th century . 
  i would dispute that . 
  at the moment a huge number of refugees from syria are fleeing for their lives . 
  latvia sent two whole crates of potatoes and sausages . 
  of course . 
  it would be racist not to . 
  [ we did it reddit ] ( https://looneytunes09.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/can-we-fix-it.jpg ), 
  especially denmark and other european nations who never colonized africa . 
  you have zero responsibility for the problem . 
  there are jobs ? 
  really ? 
  tell that to the spaniards , southern italians or greeks , many of whom are dealing with a growing migrant population and sinking economies . 
  it 's really tragic . 
  lebanon of course is the other anomaly and the whole country was majority christian not long ago . 
  in fact at the beginning of the 20th century , before the breakup of the ottoman empire , 20-25 % of the middle east was christian . 
  today it 's 2 % . 
  uptown girl , she 's been living in an uptown world .
