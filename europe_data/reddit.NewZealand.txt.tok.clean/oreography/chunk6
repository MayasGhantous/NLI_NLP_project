  we 're very similar to australia but with an added native flavour and slightly more anglophilia . 
  well for one thing there 's the religious differences . 
  the orthodox church is such a prominent part of greek culture as is islam to turkish culture , that neither are really comparable . 
  the feeling is mutual , britannia . 
  what about `` discrimination of persons based on skin colour '' . 
  recognizing racial differences is not discrimination , abusing others based on those differences is . 
  i doubt many of the baltic or ex eastern bloc states share the same view . 
  they have good reason to be very critical of their governments . 
  i agree that a more moderate and reflective approach is needed than america , but people have good reason to be suspicious of their governments . 
  conservative muslims are against musical instruments , similar to some puritan sects in christianity . 
  i believe it 's based on one or two alleged hadith 's . 
  it 's why nasheed 's and other religious songs are all vocal . 
  well church bells are at least melodic , even if they can be equally noisy . 
  i 've never heard an adhan that was enjoyable , given islam 's dislike of music . 
  it 's basically just monotonous yelling . 
  there are so many other states opposed to a federal europe though . 
  all of the scandinavians and most of the economically strong states are opposed to the idea . 
  looking at any of the polls it 's always the ex eastern bloc states that are most in favour of it , the same states that contribute the least to the eu . 
  poland is the biggest net recipient of eu funds by a mile , and romania , bulgaria and the others are all a drain on the union . 
  given the economic problems in your nation and some other southern european nations , the notion that every nation in the eu will achieve some level of economic parity is dubious as well . 
  regardless of whether the uk leaves there will always be significant opposition to the idea and for good reason - it is a very culturally tenuous and very fiscally unequal union . 
  do you really think greeks will feel welcome in turkey ? 
  there are issues with secondhand smoke from marijuana as well . 
  ultimately `` i like the drug '' and `` i do n't like the other drug '' are n't really valid arguments . 
  i suppose english is the exception in nordic countries , but most european countries are really monolingual . 
  you ca n't get away with just speaking english in portugal , russia or god forbid france . 
  even if you 're a more preferred immigrant and perhaps do have an it or other job where you can speak english , you wo n't be able to communicate with the majority of people in public situations . 
  i would criticize any anglos that immigrate to any of these countries and do n't make an effort to learn the language , as i would for any other racial group . 
  if you plan on living in another country , then adapt to the culture and learn the language . 
  it may take some time , but it 's so essential to being a good member of society . 
  i think it 's more that you should primarily adopt the customs of the host country , but you 're free to bring in any cultural customs that can do n't clash with the host country - art , cuisine etc. 
  expecting you to primarily speak your language is also no-go . 
  if you want to assimilate , you should speak the language of the country . 
  likewise if your religion teaches you attitudes that clash with the countries law ( and let 's be honest , there is only one religion that does so ) , then you should compromise your religion for the sake of integration . 
  i 'm more into edam , brie + feta tbh, 
  i know that boris johnson called for closer commonwealth integration . 
  it 's really the logical move if they do leave the eu . 
  a permanent residency scheme amongst the british dominions ( canada , australia , nz ) would make a lot of sense . 
  yes , but one statement is true and the other is false . 
  almost the entirety of aegean islands belong to greece via internationally recognized treaties . 
  nobody will back turkey if they 're claiming additional territory . 
  his comment did n't contribute much , but a good portion of this sub is american europhiles who probably are n't receptive to such views . 
  one certainly can , when one has their own sovereignty . 
  australia do it quite easily . 
  apologies ? 
  this is so foreign to me . 
  a decimal point is always associated with coinage , and the commas with the numeric units ( thousands , hundreds etc ) . 
  the commas just flow much better on the eye ** 1,234,567.89 ** looks much cleaner than ** 1.234.567,89 ** the comma in what is apparently the more common version outside of the anglosphere and commonwealth is so jarring , like it was just tacked , , , , on . 
  muh right to be here !, 
  a finn who does n't like the soviets , what a rare sight . 
  they once called britman , now not so much :(, 
  also the national party in new zealand , though they 're closer to center right . 
  the thing is with these types , is that they mistake contributory factors with it being the main factor . 
  of course tensions against the west inflamed after afghanistan and iraq , but to think that it 's solely a result of this intervention , when there were plenty of islamist attacks in the 90s and earlier in the 20th century shows that at the core , it 's an ideological problem . 
  normal people , no matter how disenfranchised they feel , do not commit suicide bombings . 
  you can not rationalize something so irrational and pinpoint such a fervent form of extremism exclusively down to politics . 
  blaming it solely on recent foreign policy is delusional . 
  why did 9/11 occur when there was no us invasion in the mena region at the time ? 
  why did the first attempted bombing on the twin towers in 1993 occur ? 
  what about the islamist violence in algeria which included a bombing on the parisian metro take place in in the 90s , which was due to domestic policies in algeria . 
  what about the 62 tourists murdered in luxor by islamists in 1997 ? 
  what about the rocket fire against israel and the suicide bombings throughout the 90s there . 
  to suggest that all of this violence is post 9/11 and post western intervention just is n't true - i do n't dispute it has been more prominent , and more frequent , but there has been islamist violence throughout the 20th century . 
  this is at the core related to the toxic ideology of islamism . 
  foreign policy concerns are secondary , and the attempt the rationalize these irrational beliefs this way is just pointless . 
  i thought it was a recent thing since i heard about it taking place in the uk last year , but apparently that 's not the case the following editions of the tour started outside france : [ 117 ] 1954 : amsterdam , netherlands 1958 : brussels , belgium 1965 : cologne , west germany 1973 : scheveningen , netherlands 1975 : charleroi , belgium 1978 : leiden , netherlands 1980 : frankfurt , west germany 1982 : basel , switzerland 1987 : west berlin , west germany 1989 : luxembourg , luxembourg 1992 : san sebasti\u00e1n , spain 1996 : den bosch , netherlands 1998 : dublin , republic of ireland 2002 : luxembourg , luxembourg 2004 : li\u00e8ge , belgium 2007 : london , united kingdom 2009 : monte carlo , monaco 2010 : rotterdam , netherlands 2012 : li\u00e8ge , belgium 2014 : leeds , united kingdom 2015 : utrecht , netherlands, 
  just fyi , you would say shade rather than shadows . 
  yes , but the majority of those fleeing syria are sunni . 
  syria is not as religiously diverse as lebanon , where there is a much larger christian population . 
  i would agree that melbourne and sydney work , but i do n't think you can point to a 90 % white country and characterize it as multicultural . 
  that 's not diversity , that 's homogeneity . 
  those three are closer to 50 % than 80 % . 
  what i 'm objecting to is you painting all of australia as a multicultural utopia , when it 's clearly not true . 
  there are plenty of towns that are 100 % white in australia . 
  the most diverse city would be melbourne , but even then it pales in comparison to really diverse cities like nyc and london . 
  even in melbourne and sydney , it seems every month there 's a story of a racist rant on a train . 
  when nine tenths of your country is white , it 's not surprising that there 's going to be racism because on the whole you 're a homogenous society . 
  what wishful thinking . 
  we are your biggest immigrant group and we largely share the same culture , as well as the same language , religion etc. 
  in tasmania and much of rural australia you find nearly 100 % white towns . 
  9/10 australians are white - outside of melbourne , sydney and perth you find hardly any immigrants . 
  not to mention your treatment of aboriginals and enforcing white immigration from the british isles up until the 1960s with the white australia policy . 
  for most of your countries lifespan you have been one of the most racist societies on the planet . 
  how can you claim to be multicultural when you 're ignoring not only the current reality , but the bulk of your countries history ? 
  britain once had a lot of goats , then they had to sell all the farms and let them run themselves . 
  some of the farms are running well but others are in near disrepair . 
  some had millions of goats , others only had a few thousand . 
  all the farms would be better off if britain was still in charge . 
  i think he probably has a better idea on the status of syrian people than you do . 
  calling them garbage is offensive to me too , but he 's probably right in that the majority coming are the less educated and lower class syrians . 
  no it 's already well published as the grexit . 
  as for the total economic collapse , perhaps the grocalypse might suit . 
  yeah , offering social benefits is pretty much the antithesis of a right wing policy . 
  what 's wrong with paying stay at home moms ? 
  you have one of the worst fertility rates in the world - i would have thought offering financial incentives to parents would be a smart policy . 
  because it backs / u/kastenbrust 's statement that islam had a violent beginning , which the poster i was responding to disagreed with . 
  i would say china is fairly close . 
  a insulated internet . 
  widespread censorship . 
  the state policy is still officially marxist ( even if in practice it 's not ) .
