  the democratic deficit is sensasionalised more than it actually is . 
  commissioners are nominated by democratically elected parliaments of states , and then must be approved by the democratically elected european parliament . 
  the audits are an issue , but this is probably due to strict standards of knowing where every single euro is spent than being an overwhelming problem . 
  as for people ` losing their soverenignty ' through imf/eu funding . 
  if these countries do n't want to reform , then they do n't have to take the money . 
  if the proposed reforms result in a default or exit from the euro zone , then members who are in the common currency lose out . 
  so it is in their interests to ensure the reforms are in the interests of the euro zone , not just those demanding/recieving reforms . 
  odd , i see the eu government as the most competent in europe and yet you say you 're ` pro europe but anti eu ' . 
  protectionism is n't always a bad thing : how is europe suppose to compete with the likes of china and africa when they have much higher wages , social protections and land values . 
  if you want to keep these things then you need to adopt a protectionist stance or face decline in those three areas . 
  regarding leadership in europe : guided by the leading economic state may sound harsh to corrupt/inefficient countries but it seems like a reasonable model . 
  if it were n't germany or france saying these things then it would be the eu , and who is to say that would make the news any more palatable ? 
  i see his point : having distorting conditions ( such as missing inflation targets ) creates rather large problems with the flow of capital . 
  surplus countries may just prop up deficit countries with cheap capital , and then when the bubble bursts quickly withdraw their money which only makes the problem worse . 
  it seems that inflation target was rather important . 
  i looked it up for you  ** article 32 ** in carrying out the tasks entrusted to it under this chapter the commission shall be guided by : ( a ) the need to promote trade between member states and third countries ; ( b ) developments in conditions of competition within the union in so far as they lead to an improvement in the competitive capacity of undertakings ; ( c ) the requirements of the union as regards the supply of raw materials and semi-finished goods ; in this connection the commission shall take care to avoid distorting conditions of competition between member states in respect of finished goods ; ( d ) the need to avoid serious disturbances in the economies of member states and to ensure rational development of production and an expansion of consumption within the union ** article 63 ** within the framework of the provisions set out in this chapter , all restrictions on the movement of capital between member states and between member states and third countries shall be prohibited . 
  from a non-european perspective : boosting competativeness is all very well and good , but it seems that just ends up translating to lower entry level wages and very little change further up . 
  i agree that taxing higher income brackets is a pretty poor substitue for a more balanced approach to cost reduction , but governments are struggling as well and the money needs to come from somewhere . 
  how much of that is true , though ? 
  i read that german and french businesses negotiated lower wages across and fewer hours , and it seems that they are n't doing so badly . 
  but how much of this broad overview applies to europe as a whole ? 
  do other governments just not have the right policy mix ? 
  how big of a problem is tax avoidance and corruption ? 
  do ridged labour laws and out-dated pension systems mean that companies are struggling with inefficent workers they ca n't get rid of who then go on pensions that are linked to their last pay-rate and burden the state ? 
  have vat tax increases really hurt small businesses ? 
  i remember reading about a year or two ago the imf advising to increase vat in countries in recession to control their budgets and wondered if that would choke small businesses . 
  i shudder to think of the day when this becomes an official metric for government . 
  transparency is generally a good thing , but trivialising issues down to 150 letters ca n't be healthy for robust public debate, 
  i think we are at one of those interesting inflection points in history , where there is a tension between states wanting to a ) engage in mass surveillance and b ) protect their industries , intellectual property and governments from industrial espionage . 
  i wonder if it has anything to do with : - britain being the most economically liberal eu state - japan wanting lower tariffs to boost their ( car ) industries i think the us said similar things for what i believe are similar reasons, 
  recent russian agression could make such a plea unpalitable . 
  especially when considering the extent that european institutions are currently - and plan - to go ( such as existing loans , the construction and participation with eu financial firewalls and ecb liquidity support ) . 
  or because the alternatives are locked up or ca n't get their message out ? 
  yeah . . think about all those potential candidates they could vote for who could offer real , constructive change ( or rather lack of candidates ) ... 
  i feel as though this entire referendum is a false dichotomy . 
  varoufakis has already suggested issuing tax credits which can be used to pay off taxes owed to the state . 
  given the current lack of stimulus and wide spread tax evasion , this could provide a useful tool to solve two problems at once . 
  this could be seen as a ` third way ' , between using the euro and issuing a new currency . 
  not sure if mr varoufakis realises what impact the current situation is having on most of his bullet points . 
  greece can continue to have the euro as their currency , but the ecb has monetary authority - so they may run out of euros to spend . 
  the ecb has been very accommodative in extending credit lines to banks , but it seems the current greek position is that those credit lines are unlimited and untouchable . 
  to the same extent , support from monetary funds ( esm and imf ) is not necessarily unlimited and untouchable either . 
  and why would anyone want to use the drachma or lend to banks if they knew greece would print money and default on loans ? 
  i do n't think the eu is ready for a westminster style parliament . 
  proportionate representation at the eu level is likely to have tribalism take hold , such as parties for ` the north ' vs ` the south ' . 
  i think the main political problems of the eu are at the member state level , with corruption , non-proportionate and poor voter turn out . 
  once those problems have been solved * then * consider making the eu level more democratic , not before . 
  i expect my government to serve their electorate . 
  if a particular sector of the economy is failing and needs help ( or in recession ) then the government should step in and help . 
  with an agreement like this , favoring the local economy would could result in punitive legal action for the government serving the people who elected them . 
  having international arbitration without judges being nominated by participating member states sounds like pretty weak accountability . 
  even if there is high standards of transparency , it is unelected judges who is accountable to no one who rules on cases bought before them . 
  and under ** what rights are protected by isds under u.s. 
  agreements ? 
  : **  ** freedom from discrimination : ** an assurance that americans doing business abroad will face a level playing field and will not be treated less favorably than local investors or competitors from third countries . 
  this means that no country can favor their domestic economy , and if they do then international companies can sue for damages . 
  i would say it 's a simplification to say that all regulation is either ` good ' or ` bad ' : having or not having regulation is only relevant in the context it is applied in . 
  in my opinion , regulation should be as minimal as possible to preform the function required . 
  [ here ] ( http://igps.victoria.ac.nz/publications/files/f34b30a11f9.pdf ) is a very good ( and short ) paper on what i would consider ` good ' regulation to be . 
  not sure about a unified vat rate , as different states have different economies and fiscal policy . 
  i do n't really see if domestic collection or international collection is the issue here ; rather it should be one or the other , who then distributes the difference between states - and it 's that distribution mechanism which is the cause of your difficulties . 
  do you think that a solution to this could be to make it easier for tax authorities to send information between each other ? 
  regulatory harmonisation is not the problem here . 
  allowing corporations to sue governments for favoring their domestic economies is . 
  the point about attacking governments with unelected bodies is just another way of describing the same problem . 
  i do n't fear harmonised laws . 
  i fear my government not being able to preform the job it was elected to do . 
  this seems like a good subject for the uk to debate on . 
  suspending voting rights for states who do not comply to democratic or judicial standards would protect the sovereignty of states that are well functioning ( which seems to be the main fear of members wishing to leave ) . 
  i thought after the lisbon treaty most decisions became qualified majority ? 
  suspending voting rights to push down good governance standards in member states at risk of dismantling democratic foundations or justice seems like a good idea . 
  what countries would not want such a mechanism ? 
  it seems to be for the good of the eu as a whole . 
  how much transparency is there for decisions made in government ? 
  is n't the point to have accountable government rather than focusing purely on the possible ` best candidate ' . 
  even bad governments may have good ideas , and knowing what to change and what to keep is as much a part of democracy as the face that leads . 
  arrogance or not , asking if there is a better way must be better than the possibility of the country collapsing or becoming a client state . 
  okay , so the premise is that : - ukraine has an ineffective government with minimal transparency and is struggling to provide for it 's people - instead of fixing those issues , the situation deteriorated to state-sponsored governments tussling , and more recently full blown annexations . 
  and i was wondering if you can try to fix the first problem instead of ignoring it or reducing the situation to the secound problem . 
  well it seems that ukraine is suffering from an inefficient and corrupt government whose economy is struggling to provide the basic needs of their citizens . 
  while there may be a broader geo-political struggle , that does n't mean you ca n't work towards fixing internal issues . 
  my point is that while territorial and energy dependency is external , surely that does n't prohibit working to improve internal conditions . 
  and the suggestion to pay for goods ( food etc ) was to find a way to both a ) reduce dependency on loans for energy and b ) to help facilitate internal change . 
  it was meant as an example , and a hope that you can improve the situation beyond reducing ukraine as a pawn to be sliced up ( or occupied ) by foreign powers . 
  surely the eu can work out some arrangement to purchase agriculture ( in exchange for government transparency ) to use for the migrant epidemic ? 
  surely you can strengthen internal accountability through diplomacy more effectively than initiating another client-state regime ? 
  the foundation of representative democracy is one citizen , one vote . 
  all arguments for democratic equality stem from that . 
  the power for the citizen to vote for an individual or party to represent them - and for government to run effectively - is transparency so that their vote is informed , as the government is ultimately accountable to enfranchised voters . 
  while free speech is an important , voting equality and transparency are the foundation of representative democracy . 
  but germany just scrapped their nuclear program ? 
  i 'm in australia , and it always amazes me that germany is leading the world in solar productions !, 
  also , are n't latest generation reactors much safer - even in disasters ? 
  why is there a free movement agreement without common boarder protection and enforcement ? 
  it seems unfair to base the economic growth rate so heavily on the ecb , considering that fiscal and structural policy also play a large roll . 
  that being said , there was an interesting argument for an increased emphasis on demand ; but how to address this in an efficient , pan-eu way ? 
  it 's not as easy as you 're making out . 
  there are different levels of proportionality , as there are different levels of democracy . 
  the cabinet could be formed by the collection of parties who manage to get over 50 % ( or a super-majority ) ; but that would be a fairly large change from the current indirect democratic system where the cabinet is nominated by member states and approved by parliament ( so it is proportionate to member states it represents ) . 
  that being said , it would be nice to see a step in that direction by increasing accountability to parliament ; making the system responsible before making it proportionate .
