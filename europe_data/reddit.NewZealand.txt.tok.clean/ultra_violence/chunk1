why is everyone so upset by this post ? 
  because the usa is irrelevant in the context of this post . 
  this is / r/europe , not / r/worldnews . 
  you 're forgetting natural gas , coal , and seafood . 
  and russia will not run out of oil any time soon . 
  especially since global warming will cause ice sheets to reduce in size , exposing even more oil reserves . 
  the eu is essentially trying to shit in russia 's bed . 
  no wonder they 're pissed . 
  but eastern bloc countries will always suck russia 's dick because russia will deny them natural gas otherwise . 
  causing their factories to seize up and their citizens to freeze to death . 
  do n't forget this does n't show the full picture . 
  i 'd also be interested to see the birth rate for teenagers , the birth rate per 1000 people , and where abortion is legal and state-funded . 
  i 'd also like to see societal perception toward abortion , e.g. 
  do they view it as `` acceptable '' or `` unacceptable '' . 
  slippery slope fallacy is generally only a fallacy when used in a formal logic context to make a ** conclusion ** . 
  it can never be used to prove something true or false , but it can be used to provide strong evidence for a possible outcome . 
  it can be used to predict something . 
  for example , imagine a frog in a saucepan of cold water . 
  you turn the heat up a little bit and say to the frog , `` it 's okay . 
  i only turned the dial a little bit . '', 
  then the water gets a tiny bit hotter . 
  the frog becomes accustomed to the warmish water . 
  then you turn the heat up a tiny bit more and say to the frog , `` do n't worry !, 
  i only turned the dial a tiny bit '' ... and the frog becomes accustomed to the warmer water . 
  you keep turning up the heat bit by bit , and each time the frog becomes accustomed to the hotter and hotter water . 
  until suddenly the water is too hot . 
  and the frog is cooked . 
  the point is that logically , turning up the heat at each step ** does n't directly kill the frog ** . 
  but it makes it much easier to get closer to the point where the frog will be cooked . 
  if you miss a step , the frog will jump out of the water . 
  but if small step by small step you heat the water , the frog will never realise . 
  that is like the slippery slope . 
  to say * `` turning up the heat cooks the frog '' * , is logically incorrect . 
  to say * `` turning the dial may be part of a chain of events that cooks the frog '' * is logically correct . 
  so slippery slope is not unconditionally a fallacy . 
  it does have it 's time and place , but it must be used properly . 
  yep . 
  just ask them why they bother to close their curtains at night . 
  it 's not because they 're doing anything suspicious . 
  they 're probably just watching tv or reading a book . 
  but nobody likes to feel like they might be being watched . 
  yep , when people say the whole `` nothing to hide line '' , i say ** just because the state does not consider you a criminal today , does not mean the state will not consider you a criminal tomorrow . 
  ** i am not upset because i have something to hide . 
  i am upset because * if i ever do need to hide from the government , i ca n't . 
  * to me , that 's is an extremely terrifying thought . 
  communism has been turned into such a dirty word because of the incompetence of previous governments ( think ussr , pcr etc ) . 
  but communism , philosophically , is basically a `` perfect '' society . 
  we should always strive to prevent governments from become like the ussr or pcr , but at the same time we should still be using the great ideals of socialism/communism to build better societies . 
   why ca n't she just take off her veil ? 
  it may seem extreme , but a muslim woman being forced to reveal her face to the public would be similar to a western woman being forced to reveal her naked chest to the public . 
  of course there is nothing offensive about a woman 's face or a woman 's breasts , but the cultural practices of hiding the face/breasts mean that actually revealing them can mean the loss of dignity , and a sense of embarrassment and shame under the scrutiny of strangers . 
  do n't forget that the only man who sees her face is her husband and close family . 
  it may seem bizarre to you , and difficult to understand , but ultimately the woman being forced to reveal her face will cause her dignity to be lost . 
  however having a veiled woman stand in the dock will not cause any loss of dignity to the curious onlookers , court officials , or the judge . 
   just because there is an association between being uncovered and indecency does n't mean that uncovering your face in court is indecent . 
  i never said it did mean that . 
  but certainly to the woman in question , it would feel indecent and wrong . 
  hence her loss of dignity . 
  she may be wrong to feel like that , but is it really her fault after likely being indoctrinated from birth by a misogynistic sexist religion ? 
   victimize the audience i really ca n't believe you said that . 
  are you insane ? 
  how in the name of gods green earth is the audience being victimised by witnessing a veiled woman ? 
   the crux of the issue is between two views on laws and justice i think you ca n't see the forest for the trees . 
  you 're assuming that by allowing the woman to keep her face veiled , somehow the course of justice has been in some way perverted . 
  nobody is arguing that the woman receive different treatment to any other person . 
  the law will still practiced , and if she is found guilty , the sentence will be the same whether she is wearing the veil or not wearing the veil . 
  the judge already exercises a huge amount of discretion . 
  i really really do not think the fundamental tenets of western justice are threatened by a woman standing in the dock wearing a veil . 
  do n't be so hysterical . 
  i hardly think that a woman walking up to the judge , lifting her veil and having her identity confirmed deserves to be placed in the same category as fisa . 
  allow the woman her dignity !, 
  the general public does not need to observe her face for justice to be done !, 
  there are many circumstances in which justice is done behind closed doors . 
  for example : * to protect identity of witnesses * to protect identity of defendant * to prevent public from being disorderly * to prevent trade secrets from becoming known to competition * to prevent matters of national security from falling into the wrong hands those are all scenarios in which the public are banned and disallowed from viewing the proceedings . 
  the public 's only choice is to assume that justice is being done . 
  it is at the judge 's discretion to allow in-camera ( which means in the chamber/private ) . 
  it is also the judge 's discretion to allow in-camera for confidential evidence etc. 
  so there is no reason why the woman 's face could n't have been viewed by the judge in-camera . 
  justice could still have been done . 
  it 's not like it would have been impossible for justice to be done simply because the public could n't see her face . 
  we 'd better find some way of scanning their thoughts to make sure they 're not thinking about anything religious too !, 
  as if the average dumbarse criminal is going to be clever enough to dress up in a burqa . 
  they 'll wear a mask like every other stupid criminal . 
  why should their ability to get a job be of any importance ? 
  is our right to respect and fair treatment dependent on our ability to get a job ? 
  also , the women are not voluntarily staying at home . 
  their husbands are forcing them to , and may beat/kill them if they leave . 
  why should a woman be subjected to that , just so some ignorant fool on the street can be saved from the `` offence '' of seeing a girl wearing a burqa ? 
  consider this scenario : i am a male , and one day i choose to walk down the street wearing a wide brimmed hat , large dark sunglasses and a beard . 
  nobody can observe my identity . 
  should that be legal , or illegal ? 
  people should have the ability to choose how they present themselves , regardless of whether it is a religious statement or not . 
  as long as it is not grossly offensive , what right does the state have to decide what items of clothing you may or may not wear ? 
  there are plenty of circumstances in which courts are held privately . 
  the public ca n't just go and observe * any * court session they choose . 
  well , how do you know justice is done in a closed court ? 
  we place a huge amount of trust in judges . 
  as a society we can only assume that they will be fair , unbiased and impartial . 
  i can not see any reason why the woman could n't approach the bench , lift her burqa , have her identity confirmed , and then replace the veil . 
  why did the entire court need to observe her face * continually * throughout the proceeding ?
