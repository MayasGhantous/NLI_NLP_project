  full transparancy to the supreme courts of all member countries , so there can be no accusation of eu parliament projecting power to unseat anti-eu or otherwise uncooperative politicians . 
  i 'm not part of a member state , but one of the main reasons i am skeptical of the union is that you allow in member states that really do n't have their shit together , and nothing is really done about fixing them . 
  in my opinion you should not have let romania and bulgaria join the union when they are such blatantly corrupt countries , especially when there is nothing the union can do to fix them . 
  the way it is now it looks like eu is trying to fix them is with a strictly keynesian approach , which has time and time again proven not to be effective . 
  especially not when concerning the corrupt !, 
   and if there 's not enough demand for food in eu , and people from outside of eu do n't want our food - i guess some eu farmers must find a new jobs . 
  this is dangerous . 
  i agree it does not make sense to pay farmers to not farm when there are eu members that are starving , but we can not let farmers give up their land even if it 's not _ currently _ needed . 
  it is quite important to have extra farmland on standby in case the demand for food grows . 
  and the demand for food _ will _ grow . 
  you do n't want to be on the other end of a population boom when we 've given all the extra farmland to flats and shopping centers . 
  and you do n't want to be there when there 's a huge wheat blight , and most of the potato farmers got jobs as accountants . 
  i 'm not talking about the [ swedish minority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) . 
  estonia has that too . 
  i 'm talking about how all finnish children have mandatory swedish classes in school , giving them a common language with the rest of the nordic countries . 
  if we 're looking at historic , cultural and political connection then there are many reasons to adopt estonia as a nordic country . 
  they had [ estonian vikings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians ) that feared the the thunder god thor . 
  they celebrate midtsommars . 
  they are lutheran . 
  they were a part of sweden until [ 1721 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonia#national_awakening_and_russian_empire ), 
  you could say that about the icelandic or faroe flag too . . : / or that the finnish flag is just a rearranged swdish flag . 
  i think it 's even more so because of the language . 
  but now that the finns are going to stop speaking swedish , we might have to look differently upon estonia . 
  any enemy of sweden is a friend to me . 
  welcome , estonia !, 
  congratulations , estonia . 
  i know it means a lot to some of you , and this will be a step to make the rest of the world see you as nordic as well . 
  i know your comment is a few months old , but reading it made me think about this comment from the japanese [ mikie kiyoi ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/03/opinion/03iht-edmik.t.html ) :  i have to live with this unfortunate fate : my native tongue is remote from european languages . 
  yet i believe i have the right to request that my anglo-american friends who are involved in international activities not abuse their privilege , even though they do not do so intentionally . 
  first of all , i would like them to know that the english they speak at home is not always an internationally acceptable english ... 
  i sincerely believe there exists a cosmopolitan english - a lingua franca , written or spoken - that is clearly different from what native speakers use unconsciously in their daily life ... we non-natives are desperately learning english ; each word pronounced by us represents our blood , sweat and tears . 
  our english proficiency is tangible evidence of our achievements of will , not an accident of birth . 
  dear anglo-americans , please show us you are also taking pains to make yourselves understood in an international setting . 
  saying that gattaca is good help for learning esperanto is like saying [ koroshiya 1 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0296042/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) is good help for learning english . 
  i think the coolest thing is that they pla to cover it in regolith . 
  they are making space hobbits . 
  game of thrones is filmed there , and star wars viii is currently being filmed there . 
  got ta prepare for the robot uprising . 
  ca n't use drones to fight drones once skynet bans intra-drone violence !, 
  might want to turn that into koskenkorva salmiakki for full power . 
  many species of man drink vodka , but few can eat the fruit of satan 's asshole and claim to enjoy it . 
  none of the ones in this thread even come close to how bad some of the ones in norway are . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/effaejk.png ) looks like it was drawn by a fourth grader . 
  i wish i was joking , but it 's a legit coat of arms . 
  yeah nutella uses a quarter of the world 's hazelnut supplies . 
  it 's pretty big - and a lot more transportable than cannoli . 
  turns out the portugese still remember how to cook after moving abroad . 
  switzerland or vietnam might be worse examples . 
  he 's more beautiful , like a topographical map of utah . 
  yeah i remember that time when you married scarlett johansson and became people magazine 's sexiest man alive . 
  there 's actually an upcoming norwegian movie about this type of problem . 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5248342/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 in the movie , a casual racist guy converts his failing hotel into an refugee camp to make money . 
  no considerations at all and makes shiah room with sunni etc. 
  i 'm looking forward to it . 
  i think it was the average temperature for the day . 
  i think it dropped below freezing during the night at some point . 
  also coastal norway is surprisingly warm because of the gulf stream . 
  probably winters too . 
  we have a town in norway that recently celebrated 2 years without temperatures below freezing . 
  the second guy from the right in picture six that could n't figure out which way to cross his legs to hide his dick from the camera . 
  it would be 144 to one with north korea . 
  and while it 's not as much of a numbers game anymore , you 're fighting an enemy with nukes that might even be willing to use them . 
  i can only speak for myself , but my phone is used for a lot more than `` flappy bird '' . 
  i have my family photos on this thing . 
  it 's a lot more practical to carry a phone with me than a photo album . 
  hell , i could even use it to make phone calls and let my family know i 'm alive . 
  i do n't even have to carry a phone book with me because the numbers are stored right there in the phone . 
  if war broke out in your country , do you think that would make your phone disappear ? 
  it 's called a rain dance !, 
  sausages on trains . 
  it 's the german way . 
  english is more widely spoken in africa than french is . 
  hezbollah has been _ accused _ of suicide bombings and such many times , but always denied it . 
  real terror organisations like isis take credit for terror acts they did n't even do . 
  you should see what they charge for domestic flights . . 
  dude it 's not far . 
  you could row there . 
  yeah probably . 
  north korea has massive highways . 
  this is actually a sign of bad traffic engineering . 
  there is this misguided notion that you can alleviate congestion by building more and bigger roads . 
  the fact is that you can not . 
  more spacious roads make it more attractive to drive , so the roads quickly fill up to achieve a congestion equilibrium . 
  not only does it become more attractive to drive with more roads , but it actually becomes more _ necessary _ . 
  as roads get larger , buildings get farther apart , and walking soon stops being a feasible option . 
  i do n't speak arabic , but supposedly it says `` which one do you want to wear on the day of judgement ?

  yes if there 's one thing the middle east lacks it is oil money . 
  here 's another good-looking scandinavian speciality : https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/risengrynsgr%c3%b8t#/media/file:flickr_-_cyclonebill_-_risengr%c3%b8d_og_nisse%c3%b8l.jpg, 
  traditional scandinavian food is not very aesthetically pleasing . 
  https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapskoussi but we do n't go to your country and tell you your food is dog food . 
  who , by the way , is an actual german using his actual german accent in his documentaries . 
  here is one example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mntu_hjobya, 
  mormons would outlaw abortions if they could . 
  i guess i just had n't heard about people complaining about the lack of wolves in england . 
   they 're far more efficient at mass murdering animals than we were were . 
  nope . 
  the only reason cats kill more wild animals than us is because we 've figured out how to domesticate animals before we kill them .
