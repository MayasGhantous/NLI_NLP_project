http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereign_state this is the common use of the term `` state '' when not discussing specific federal states . 
  already exists -- there 's a few hundred russians on svalbard , and russia owns/used to own a few small towns on the islands . 
  french city limits are arbitrary and tight . 
  you do n't really think of london as * actually * 4 times bigger than paris , even though paris 's 19th century city limits only contain roughly 2 million people . 
  the metro area of marseille has a couple million inhabitants ( in fact , lyon 's has a few hundred thousand more people ) . 
  there are not even regularly scheduled * non * - high-speed trains between oslo and copenhagen at the moment . 
  indeed , not only do you have to change trains , you have to do it * twice * . 
  maybe starting regular train services would be an idea before you start thinking of high-speed rail . 
  there are no lidl stores in norway anymore . 
  as far as i can see there has been absolutely no coverage of this in norwegian media . 
  now i did n't really understand the video , but if it is about what i think it 's about , then it 's pretty much the default in a lot of countries . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whip_ ( politics ) even in countries such as my own where parties do not have official whips , you 're going to be in trouble if you vote against your party on important topics . 
  given that hungarians are sometimes called magyars in english , it does n't seem all that odd . 
  i have no idea how this would weaken them ? 
  st\u00f8re , the most likely candidate , is very popular . 
  a pretty weird selection of cities . 
  denmark 's largest ( copenhagen ) and fourth largest ( aalborg ) cities are included , while the second and third largest are n't . 
  so what are these pig killings all about ? 
  while the other people who have replied to you have a point , the fallout universe is still pretty fucking unrealistic in this regard . 
  at the time of fallout : new vegas , california has a functioning society with a relatively strong central state , and yet everything still looks like it 's been abandoned for a century . 
  if that were the main cause , then people from the poorest countries of africa would surely smile the least . 
  is this really accurate ? 
  throughout the financial crisis i always heard that poland was doing better than the rest of europe , but i never heard anything about slovakia . 
  yet , according to this map , slovakia did better than poland during the financial crisis . 
  i 'm pretty sure your government is just bad at classifying transactions . 
  what exactly do you want ? 
  there is a linux client that works fine . 
  well , the price of electricity sometimes passes 70-80 \u00f8re / kwh . 
  that 's probably not expensive compared to the price in countries that have no waterfalls and need to get their power from nuclear plants , but the average norwegian probably feels it 's very expensive . 
  given that the vast majority of norway 's electricity comes from hydroelectric plants , however , the price of electricity varies wildly depending on region , time of year and various random factors . 
  it 's often very cheap , but it can also be very expensive at times . 
  i would guess that the most popular beer is in fact tuborg , since it is widely sold in the entire country . 
  of course , it 's danish . 
  frydelund is , in my opinion , the best norwegian beer you can get for under 50 nok ( the starting price of beer from smaller breweries like n\u00f8gne \u00d8 ) . 
  in addition to their bayer , i very much enjoy their fat\u00f8l . 
  i do n't understand this . 
  i thought they made fruit juice and other processed fruit products from the `` ugly '' fruit ? 
  most norwegians live in wooden single-family houses in a suburban area .

  another option for families that do n't want to or ca n't afford to live in a house of their own or is to live in a [ housing cooperative ( borettslag ) ] ( https://www.google.no/maps?ll=60.376831,5.345621&amp;spn=0.004449,0.013937&amp;cbp=12,236.22,,0,5.2&amp;layer=c&amp;panoid=kw42jzl3u_nft4pwrznbuw&amp;cbll=60.376717,5.345635&amp;t=h&amp;z=17 ) . 
  the city centres have brick town houses , like [ this ] ( https://www.google.no/maps?ll=60.389975,5.318413&amp;spn=0.008895,0.027874&amp;cbp=12,41.95,,0,-3.61&amp;layer=c&amp;panoid=b1y6b4h0wuprhydlihou_g&amp;cbll=60.389941,5.318001&amp;t=h&amp;z=16 ) , but comparatively few people live in this type of building -- mostly young or single people . 
  poorer areas have [ big apartment buildings ] ( https://www.google.no/maps?ll=59.959916,10.920143&amp;spn=0.009012,0.027874&amp;cbp=12,344,,0,-3.12&amp;layer=c&amp;panoid=jaw_q1sq3-6dtlmiqb1mjg&amp;cbll=59.959916,10.920143&amp;t=h&amp;z=16 ) mostly built in the post-war decades , familiar from sweden and eastern europe . 
   new law that 's been introduced on january 1st with regard to fiscalization of cash registers has resulted in around 50 % more reported turnover in shops , bars , restaurants , etc. 
  will this have an effect on your reported gdp ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbondcmckdc ) british entry is my all-time favourite . 
  ukraine 's [ 2007 entry ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfjhjnevone ) is a good runner-up . 
  the police has n't resumed official investigation ( yet ) . 
  * after independent investigation , it turns out the [ scandinavian star fire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_star#fire ) , which caused 159 deaths , may have been a conspiracy to commit insurance fraud . 
  * justin bieber is about to visit the country . 
  1998 world cup victory against brazil probably ranks pretty high . 
  there are definitely classes in norway with 35 students . 
  over 30 is relatively common . 
  if the population of an area grows too much in too short time , this kind of thing happens , because expanding or building a new school takes too long time . 
  only if the number of students per class gets too extreme do they start putting students in other schools . 
  i 'm thinking carbon monoxide poisoning . 
  probably accidental , and the smugglers got desperate and just left the truck somewhere . 
  the methodology is not clear . 
  do the numbers , for instance , include rooms with a shared kitchen ? 
  what 's the deal with all the asian workers in that factory ? 
  did czechoslovakia import asian workers to build cars ? 
  yes , that 's true . 
  the unlikelihood of a coup being organized by the top brass of the military is the reason why i noted that coups in general often have their origin among lower ranking officers . 
  that 's not a very helpful answer , guy . 
  i presented some arguments for the possibility of a military coup , and i would like to hear some alternate views or counter-arguments . 
  i emphatically did * not * say that `` a military coup will happen '' , which would warrant a response like yours . 
  geitost please . 
  but the weird thing is that americans like to call it `` gjetost '' . 
  what dialect is that even from ? 
  it 's a great way to experience a sexual harrassment lawsuit for those interested in that !, 
  donald duck comics mostly are n't written ( or drawn ) by americans . 
  i 'm pretty sure less fancy polling stations in norway also use garbage bins -- or at least they used to . 
  ski , but that 's a clich\u00e9 . 
  cycling is surprisingly popular ; definitely more so than sports like ice hockey that have declined significantly in popularity in recent years . 
  is n't this exactly what hungary 's prime minister is saying ? 
  english speakers seem to think `` odd '' is an odd name . 
  yeah , the obvious solution is to marry someone with that surname and immediately adopt it . 
  and then divorce them ( or not ) . 
  you do n't necessarily get new year 's eve and christmas eve off unless your employer is feeling generous . 
  beer is actually more expensive in bergen and trondheim than in oslo , but if you 're paying 120 kr you 've either just stumbled into the biggest tourist trap in town or are buying an expensive craft beer . 
  by neighbour pub i 'm thinking of a place like [ this ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/place/orlandos+pub/@59.9195007,10.7497939,19.32z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x50e4b3e048080735!8m2!3d59.919455!4d10.7501355 ) or [ this ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/place/barotto+as/@59.9120626,10.7178348,18.08z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x3c728e4503e85347!8m2!3d59.9119899!4d10.7189099 ) , not somewhere you 'd go on a friday night . 
  these usually serve 0.5 l beer for somewhere between 55 and 75 nok ( although if you 'd like a direction to some really trashy places that are even cheaper , feel free to send a pm  ) . 
  it 's true you can easily find more expensive tap beer , but that 's true everywhere . 
  craft beers are always more expensive than the house lager . 
  i would say beer is cheaper than that in basically every actual `` neighbour pub '' in oslo . 
  but if their `` expat area '' is somewhere glitzy like [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aker_brygge ) , i can see how they arrived at $ 9.90 . 
  [ the same view today . 
  does n't work if you 've consumed enough methanol . 
  does it ? 
  poland , czech rep. and hungary look about the same as france or spain . 
  ukraine and russia are dim , but both are sparsely populated . 
  op : your numbers are off and look more like non-ppp numbers . 
  check out [ this article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) . 
  diminishing returns means richer countries will grow slower than poorer ones , so the gap will become smaller as time passes . 
  as for actually catching up , it 's unlikely because that would require an economic downturn in western europe that does n't affect eastern europe , but the latter 's economies are almost entirely tied to the former 's , so that 's highly unlikely .

  unimatrix is from a euro country .
