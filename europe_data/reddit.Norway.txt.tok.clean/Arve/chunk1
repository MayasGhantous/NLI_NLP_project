this is the f/4l without stabilization - so there are a few limitations - forget it for concert photography , or as a low-light walkaround at night . 
  if you can live with those limitations , it 's a gorgeous , sharp and relatively cheap lens . 
  would i want the is version , or even the f/2 .8 . 
  hell yes , but i can live with this .

  some context - allowing for writing in dialect '' \u00c6 e i a \u00e6 \u00e5 '' is an actual and complete sentence : * '' \u00c6 '' = jeg = i , me * `` e '' = er = is * `` i '' = i = in * `` a '' typically refers to class in school , where students are divided in to the a , b , c ... class in their grade ( not in reference to how well they do - it 's mostly a geographical distinction between students in a school ) * '' \u00e5 '' = `` og '' = too * '' \u00e6 \u00e5 '' = `` jeg og '' = me too so : `` jeg er i a jeg og '' = `` i am in a me too '' ( lit .

  apparently , you can make ( time-limited ) applications where you do n't participate , but there 's no guarantee that it 's granted . 
  ( likewise , if a political party puts you on their ballot , you can apply to be taken off . 
  this has apparently changed since i last looked at it ), 
  because , once elected , you 're performing a duty , not a job . 
  the chance of this ever happening is so slim anyway . 
  basically , the only parties that have been known to sign up unwilling persons are extreme right-wing parties, 
  nope - there are essentially two ways out : die , or commit a type of crime that takes away your right to vote . 
  well , not really . 
  political parties more or less have the right to put anyone they wish on their ballot , as long as they 're not a member of another political party . 
  it 's considered extremely bad practice and in poor manner to do so , though .

  public transportation in my area is 400 nok/month - travel as much as you like .

  you quickly learn to want what 's best for you . 
  the year i spent there i had hard office hours from 08:00 in the morning ( navy ) , so after a few days you settled in , and you blacked out the windows when it was absolutely necessary to get to bed .

  i 'm not sure what you mean , but : 1 . 
  waste water in a household can be used for reheating , and afaik , this is being employed in null/plus houses ( houses that use no net energy or produce more energy than they consume ) . 
  hot water for showering , dishes etc. 
  ca n't be cycled directly into water-borne heating , given that it carries contaminants - if you want to recycle the heat , see 1 ) - you 'll use a heat exchange process that heats the water from any incoming water-borne heating . 
   edit : just been realising , it 's waste heat that heats the water , so it does n't matter the efficiency , as it 's kinda free . 
  precisely . 
  water-borne heating also does n't need to be very hot . 
  it 's mid-february in norway , and i 'm heating ~ 50m ^ 2 with the heat from the pipes running through my apartment , with water running into one single of the three radiators i have . 
  my glassed-in balconies were hot enough for me to sit there for ten minutes wearing nothing but a pair of pants . 
  water for heating is in a closed-loop system . 
  the hot water you shower in needs to be kept constantly above 65c to kill the listeria bacteria , unless you want the bacteria to kill you . 
  water borne heating is not the same water used as hot tap water - people still typically have their own boiler ( or one that is common to the building ) . 
  the hot tap water needs to be over 65 degrees so you do n't die from listeria after taking a shower . 
  nope , those are different shows .

   the op does n't really clarify to that extent as evident by the multiple errors ( see my top-level correction ) , the post was a bit rushed / but / u/lohrenswald is essentially correct . 
  i made my map with `` contiguous region '' as a requirement . 
  if you disregard that , and simply go by [ urban area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_urban_areas_in_norway_by_population ) as definition , half of norway 's population lives in the 28 biggest such areas , covering a total of 989,1 km ^ ( 2 ) , or about 0.3 % of mainland norway . 
  related : the beige half is only marginally bigger than finnmark county - finnmark is 48631,04 km ^ ( 2 ) , whereas half the population lives in counties with a combined area of 58419,72 km ^ ( 2 ) - that disparity would grow further if you ignored the lesser populated municipalities in buskerud and telemark - since basically only the coastal cities have significant populations,

  this second submission has the wrong legend and the wrong counties . 
  but , if we do n't bother with correcting the legend of this one , the beige-yellow here is 3 013 520 people , or ~ 58 % of the population , where the green area is 42 % of the population,
