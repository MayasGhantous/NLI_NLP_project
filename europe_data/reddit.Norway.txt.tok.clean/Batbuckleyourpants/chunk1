exactly , we cant risk tigers crossing our borders freely !, 
  so is abdul qadeer khan . 
  who studied in europe , then stole european nuclear secrets , and helped pakistan get nukes . 
  something about that number seems off . 
  obviously the hacker used a massive keyboard , so that even more people could use it at the same time . 
  using what money ? 
  [ you really cant . 
  to my knowlage , they calmed down quite a bit during the late 90 's . 
  sure . 
  got a few favorites . 
  how do you sink a swedish submarine ? 
  swim down and knock on the hatch . 
  how do you sink a norwegian submarine ? 
  use a swedish crew . 
  why did the swede carry a car door through the desert ? 
  if he got hot , he could just roll down a window . 
  a popular swedish party game : one swede enter a box , while the rest take turns guessing which one of them it is . 
  what is the difference between swedes and norwegians ? 
  the swedes have great neighbors . 
  why do swedes never play hide and seek ? 
  nobody ever bother looking for them . 
  what is the swedish word for genius ? 
  tourist, 
  i know a million swedish jokes . 
  `` how do you sink a swedish ship ? 
  you [ put it on water ] ( https://viewfromanopenrectorywindow.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/vasa-sinking-howat.jpg ) '', 
  yup . 
  in e.t , virtually all the adults are assholes . 
  obviously a child 's psyche is too fragile to see adults being the baddies , so of course the government had to step in . 
  we have a history of banning movies for stupid reasons . 
  we banned e.t because it portrayed adults as the bad guys . 
  throw cinnamon on the ground and force them to sweep it up . 
  and ~ ~ usa ~ ~ non-eu nations already surpassed eu as the largest trade partners to gb a few years ago . 
  edit : correction . 
  nobody want to cross the ocean during storm season or during the winter . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=976mmtnblbg ), 
  they will probably blame the poor again . 
  even they dont work for free . 
  and you dont pay toll . 
  they are more worried that the ban would be anti-semitic , than that circumcision itself is anti-child . 
  and norway , that half hour is almost certainly the moment all year nrk has the highest viewer ratings . 
  christmas would not be the same without gathering in front of the tv and watching it . 
  every christmas for almost 30 years now . 
  i guess you could say it is the same procedure as every year . 
  i mean , yeah ... the romani are leaving the country . 
  italy should be available to both sides . 
  ** sir humphrey appleby ** : minister , britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last 500 years : to create a disunited europe . 
  in that cause we have fought with the dutch against the spanish , with the germans against the french , with the french and italians against the germans , and with the french against the germans and italians . 
  divide and rule , you see . 
  why should we change now , when it 's worked so well ? 
  james hacker : that 's all ancient history , surely . 
  ** sir humphrey appleby ** : yes , and current policy . 
  we had to break the whole thing up , so we had to get inside . 
  we tried to break it up from the outside , but that would n't work . 
  now that we 're inside we can make a complete pig 's breakfast of the whole thing : set the germans against the french , the french against the italians , the italians against the dutch . 
  the foreign office is terribly pleased ; it 's just like old times . 
  ** james hacker ** : surely we 're all committed to the european ideal . 
  ** sir humphrey appleby ** : really , minister . 
  [ laughs ] ** james hacker ** : if not , why are we pushing for an increase in the membership ? 
  sir humphrey appleby : well , for the same reason . 
  it 's just like the united nations , in fact . 
  the more members it has , the more arguments it can stir up . 
  the more futile and impotent it becomes . 
  ** james hacker ** : what appalling cynicism . 
  ** sir humphrey appleby ** : yes . 
  we call it diplomacy , minister . 
  a man with an axe could simply be a lumberjack . 
  but when he puts on a trillion dollar suit of armor , get more and more axes , and starts pacing right outside your door while staring at you through the window , that is enough to make anyone do stupid thing, 
  * the swiss be like * . 
  `` what the fuck are you guys doing ? '', 
  in my experience , if you are within earshot of a finn , you are already annoying him . 
  beating children was an important tenant in most christian branches too . 
  female privilege beats racism . 
  they did , but turns out muslims do it , so now a ban is racist and defended by people on both sides, 
  my bad . 
  french guiana was never colonized or controlled by europe ? 
  what ? 
  as a norwegian who visits denmark frequently , i get the same feeling . 
  denmark is literally made up from what the ice ages scraped off our mountains . 
  had never even seen a sand beach before visiting denmark , denmark is pretty much all sand . 
  with their highest `` mountain '' , half the height of my sunday walks . 
  make neptun pay for it !, 
  [ turns out turtles are real fucking fast when they want to be . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyumghdk9e8 ), 
  conquering finland would be one thing , but how the fuck would you hold it ? 
  no wonder the russians turned around and went home o_o, 
  crimea seems to have made a pretty sweet trade too . 
  agreed , the danes are lovely people . 
  i do have questions about crimea though ... 
  im saying they are setting up an european army , i never said anyone was forcing anything . 
  the powers that be in the eu parlament , very much want a unified army , and they are getting one . 
  if the end result is the entire eu joining the german army , or starting an eu army from scratch . . the end result is the same . 
  a unified eu army , regardless how how they got it . 
  just last month the eu voted yes on a [ european union joint military headquarters . 
  ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/eu-approves-joint-military-headquarters/a-37830963 ) saying the eu is not building an army is just ignoring the facts . 
  they are using the german army as the framework for an integrated eu army , they are calling it the `` framework nations concept '' just read the link . 
   the eu is n't raising an army i see ... well , i wish someone would go tell that to germany . 
  [ they dont seem to have gotten the memo ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/05/22/germany-is-quietly-building-a-european-army-under-its-command/ ) . 
  they have already integrating the military of several eu member countries into the bundeswehr . 
  yeah ... no way this will be abused .
