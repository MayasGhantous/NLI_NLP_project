yeah !, 
  you tell them what 's up , ~ ~ friend ~ ~ . . ~ ~ buddy ~ ~ . . random internet stranger !, 
  that 's right !, 
  just try to befriend me , bitch !, 
   the success of usa 's political system ha , good one !, 
  and for american unification , the case is very different . 
  each state did n't speak different languages . 
  they also have n't spent hundreds of years as independent countries each with a long history behind it . 
  there were all basically british colonies . 
  i personally would n't mind norway joining the eu and eu gaining a stronger central authority , necessarily . 
  there is a lot of good that has come out of the eu if you ask me . 
  i like eu 's efforts to standardize products and services across borders and having a high standard on regulation . 
  however i still have some doubts about joining when i see member states like france and germany wanting to add backdoors to encryption or eu itself negotiating treaties like ttip . 
  i like an eu putting human life and health before corporate interests . 
  i do n't want a usa v2 .0 . 
  let 's please agree to never call it the united states of europe . 
  i do n't think we should look across the atlantic ocean for inspiration . 
  i see your point . 
  shame there are n't any ugly people in norway though . 
  why is there only one ? 
  this should have been a gallery like the ` lithuanian national costumes ' post . 
  here is one from [ bergen ] ( http://www.norskebunader.no/uploads/photos/7987/prod_details-rob_6295.jpg ) at least . 
  but you were like pretty much the only one in europe that did n't have civil law ... you guys have common law , no ? 
  we were attacked :'(, 
  wait , there is ice in iceland ? 
  i though it was the green one . 
  the more you know . 
  why do people keep making the white lines in the norwegian flag so thin . 
  the thickness of the white is suppose to be half the thickness of the blue . 
  the blue should also be darker , same with the swedish flag . 
  still awesome rockets though . 
  i dare you to go to their respective websites and say it again . 
  [ epp ] ( http://www.epp.eu/ ) , [ pes ] ( http://www.pes.eu/ ) epp is obviously blue while pes is obviously red . 
  this is a common coloring scheme in europe with socialist-left being red , etc. 
  in all seriousness i think 1:37 is sweden . 
  afterwards it moves over denmark before stopping by the netherlands . 
  it 's still sweden being the odd one out as they are stored in the fridge in norwegian stores too . 
  hogwash !, 
  if you look closely you 'll see he still has his red shirt on under the hoodie . 
  i had no idea that was special . 
  i looked up several wikipedia pages of greece but in different languages , they all indeed seemed to say either greece or grekenland . 
  i 've been growing up saying `` hellas '' all my life . 
  wonder why norway is so special in this regard . 
  i still refer to people from greece as `` greker '' or to something greek as `` gresk '' , so why did we stop saying `` grekenland '' ? 
  ( if it were ever commonly spoken ), 
  it means `` no interacting with strangers '' . 
  the finnish are not very social creatures and you can easily startle them by e.g. 
  talking to them . 
  [ i posted it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/invisiblebicycles/comments/6n6glo/the_dutch_pm_after_gifting_his_bike_to_indias_pm/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link ) . 
  luckily there were [ a post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/invisiblebicycles/comments/6k5pal/indias_pm_being_gifted_a_bicycle_by_the_dutch_pm/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link ) with the dutch prime minister just two posts ago so that i could * steal * the title from it . 
  be careful what you ask for :p . i 'm having problems sleeping so i thought why not , let 's give it a shot . 
  never really done this before though . 
  actually pretty happy with the result . 
  not sure it 's r/invisiblebicycles worthy though . 
  not done yet , but here , have a progress picture . 
  that may be . 
  whatever it is , it 's kinda interesting watching the live number on their web page go up and down tens of millions of euros every second . 
  it 's now 200 million euros less than my last comment ( 18 min ) . 
  so from 846.8 billion to 846.6 billion . 
  847 billion euros now . 
  i appreciate when things that sounds kinda stupid actually has a reasonable explanation behind them . 
  could have been worse . 
  could have called him a dane . 
  iirc , they add chlorine to the water , so a bit more than just opinion . 
  it 's like drinking swimming pool water . 
  i went to the uk once forgetting where i was , and yeah , the water did taste like ass . 
  true . 
  i searched around and found this piece of code in one of my neural software updates from 2007 . if ( cake ) { say ( `` cake is a lie !, 
  you need to get that thing fixed . . the bottom tine is all bent backwards . 
  maybe in british english , but this is european english . 
  and as you can see [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistic_issues_concerning_the_euro#written_conventions,_for_the_euro_in_different_languages_of_eu_member_states#written_conventions_for_the_euro_in_different_languages_of_eu_member_states ) , the majority of languages in europe ( eu here ) put the currency sign at the end . 
  and even in standard british/american english the fractional part is put the end of the number . 
  $ 1.00 = 100 cents, 
  but i liked the fact he put the dollar sign at the end ... 
  wow , so straight !, 
  strangely the banner and the scandi-cock were giving me the opposite impression . 
  gave it a shot . 
  [ site1 ] ( http://viewsync.net/watch?v=c_mefzb4yzk&amp;t=0&amp;v=wo4z9lbarg8&amp;t=71 ) [ site2 ] ( http://youtubedoubler.com/?video1=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dwo4z9lbarg8&amp;start1=71&amp;video2=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dc_mefzb4yzk&amp;start2=0&amp;authorname=foreu ), 
  why do the colors go from blue to black ? 
  what 's so special about the range 45-50 that it gets to split the entire map in half ? 
  would it not be better if the map went from very light green to an intense green ? 
  this is a spectrum of all positive values right ? 
   some people may think it 's a space shot for no special reason hi !, 
  the secretary general of nato is also from norway . 
  we are slowly taking over the world !, 
  and by the time they all realize all leaders have been norwegianfied , it will be too late !, 
  i love how the queen does n't have any body guards since she is in no real danger , seeing that she is already immortal . 
  unless you are blue-yellow color blind , then you are fucked . 
  0/1 and 3/4 looked identical to each other . 
  source : my phones color blind debug mode . 
  the color choice is dreadful . 
  [ this ] ( http://colorbrewer2.org ) might help for next time . 
  exact same for norway . 
  though for the usa it was `` an eea country '' and for russia the top three was `` in europe '' , `` in the eu '' and `` in nato '' . 
  the uk was just `` in the eu '' . 
  well at least neither can the rest of the nordic countries ( except denmark ) . 
  thanks for the link , it was an interesting read !, 
  [ relevant vsauce video ] ( https://youtu.be/guccobwisos ) 4:13 to be exact . 
  feels wierd that people are being upset over people calling it czechia as i 've been calling it that ( tsjekkia ) all my life and never knew it was even a problem until recently . 
  naturally czechia sounds completly fine to me .
