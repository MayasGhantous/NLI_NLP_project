these guys were german , going to another country an destroy the flag of the country they visit ... 
  i am sure a bunch of mexicans coming to the us to burn an american flag would have no problems whatsoever / s, 
  immigration, 
  oslo has great public transport metro , tram , bus , boat . 
  i much prefer using public transport rather than my car inside oslo and its suburbs . 
  the further away you get from the city the less public transport ( except for in some other smaller cities like stavanger , bergen , etc. ) . 
  in large parts of the country you really need to have a car , since it is so sparsely populated and therefore very little public transport available, 
  spotted the guy who asked that question !, 
  no , but we make sure to buy ~ ~ 6 ~ ~ 9 months of supplies before the snow makes it impossible to go out, 
  will shops be open in december or does everything close in winter ? 
  [ what does the fox say ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofnr_wkoce ), 
   germany is like a jack of most trades , master of few . 
  germany is a word leader in cars , machinery , chemicals ... and football, 
  how much of a voice would we have with less than 1 % if the population ? 
  oh , i forgot - eu is not so good at this democracy thingy ... more importantly : we stay outside of eu control in some very important areas , connected to our natural resources . 
  so , yes we did well by voting not to join the eu, 
  [ ten water-polo clubs in norway ] ( http://svomming.no/vannpolo/vannpolo-forside ) , so that should be lose to 100 players , right ? 
  they are taking over our nation !, 
  in parts of germany it can be difficult if you only know english . 
  more specifically in the former gdr outside berlin , dresden and leipzig, 
  cards and smartphones are used for almost `` everything '', 
  it will be business as usual . 
  the tunnel is owned by a company called [ groupe eurotunnel se ] ( http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com ) , which is a publicly listed company . 
  if you have enough money you can buy it !, 
  yes , agriculture and fish/seafood is outside norway 's agreement with the eu - hence the difference in price, 
   we have more beautiful nature :d but the swedes got better neighbours !, 
  the main benefit for norway is that outside eu we keep control of our natural resources . 
  we have a trade agreement with eu , but energy , fisheries and agriculture is * not * included . 
  so , we control our own oil , gas , hydroelectric power , fisheries and agriculture . 
  in most other ways norway is well integrated with eu another point is the ( lack of ) democracy in the eu . 
  and if the democratic processes in the eu would improve , norway would have very little influence . 
  norway has about 1 % of the population of eu . 
  in a true democracy we would only have 1 % influence , which is not much . 
  eu would claim that norway would be given a bigger influence , but why would we believe it to be so in the long term ? 
  this is a parallell to discussions on the electoral system in the us : clinton had more votes , but trump got elected because some votes count for more than others . 
  in eu norway would be like minnesota and germany and france would be like california . 
  most norwegians do not think we would have anywhere the same influence as germany ( and rightfully so ) . 
  why would we trade our independence for a deal like that ? 
  only about 20 % of the population would be in favour of norway joining the eu - and this number is decreasing quickly, 
  it is pretty similar . 
  business in sweden is more formal . 
  in groups , there is a greater felt need that everybody agrees before making a decision . 
  trade unions are stronger in sweden . 
  swedes tend to feel that norwegians are not detailed enough when solving a problem , while norwegians think swedes are too slow and too afraid to think outside of the box . 
  swedes have much better lunches , plus their lovely `` fika '' . 
  but compared to the rest of the world , these differences are minimal source : norwegian who has worked quite a lot in sweden,

  whenever someone mentions mordor , my thoughts go to nikel, 
   the east ? 
  is the weather warmer there than in the west ? 
  to my knowledge there are no real differences in temperature between the two coasts over here . 
  oslo feels very much warmer than bergen . 
  it is not only about temperatures , but also the fact that it always rains and much wind on the west coast . 
  oslo is quite sheltered , and most tourists are very surprised about how ` warm ' oslo can be in summer . 
  many also expects oslo to be full of snow in winter , which it usually is not, 
  vegan is becoming more popular in norway among young urban people . 
  many restaurants in oslo have vegan dishes , and a few specializes in vegan food . 
  but veganism is still far less common than in germany, 
  probably the island of vega . 
  you travel literally by car for 12 hours northwards from oslo to the small town of br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund . 
  there you catch a boat travelling for a couple of hours straight west ( in direction canada ), 
   slalom is a discipline . 
  yes , of course . 
  but that 's were ` alpine ' skiing started as a sport, 
  [ slalom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slalom_skiing#history ) is a norwegian word , and the concept started in telemark , norway, 
  skiing as a sport and ( maybe ) the invention of skis, 
  best known for `` what does the fox say ? '', 
  which came from one of their shows . 
  but they 've got plenty of other stuff,

  yes , such situations are rare . 
  in my country it recently made it to the first page of our biggest newspaper when the police shot one person - ** in the leg ** . 
  he was n't seriously hurt , but needed some medical attention, 
  the big teams in the popular sports like soccer are big business . 
  there is usually a big substructure underneath the top league . 
  every year , the weakest teams are relegated to level 2 , and the top teams from level 2 are promoted to level 1 . 
  for big sports there are many , many levels - and for each level there is this relegation and promotion thing . 
  the best teams from each nation competes for the european championship through the champions league this means that - in theory - any team can be promoted to a place where they play on top level , and it all becomes big business . 
  and in the long term , any club may win the european championship . 
  in practical terms it will of course never happens that a village team will climb all the way up where it becomes a successful business : `` out-in-the stick-football-club '' from norway , will never really compete with bayern munich , manchester united or real madrid - although it is theoretically possible . 
  so , for those who plays on the lower levels it is a hobby - while it is a well paid job for the ones at the top, 
  actually , bandy is mostly swedish and russian thing ( maybe finland as well ? ) . 
  although norway technically have a national bandy team and a small league , you never see any sort of coverage on tv of this sport, 
  you nailed it !, 
  which just go to show that you do not know everything . 
  but we already knew that :d, 
  i am telling you i have it - so yes , there is such a thing as scandinavian feel, 
  sweden or germany , with denmark on third place, 
   the idea of europe is so much older than social security that pretending they are connected is kinda stupid the idea of creating social security in european countries , grew out of a common set of values - that is shared by franc and norway . 
  you can easily label that ` european '  i feel like norway is a lot more similar to america than germany what ? 
  i work a lot in germany and find it to be very similar to norway . 
  the northern parts of germany ( schleswig-holstein ) has a very scandinavian feel to it, 
  i do not think it was only a norwegian prince that was butthurt . 
  and even if it was ( which it was n't ) , most people prefer to be ruled by someone from their own country , rather than a foreign power that has imposed itself on them . 
  you can always find ways to rationalize colonization by military might - but that does n't make it any more ethical, 
  in the us you say you go to church if if you do n't - in europe you say you do n't go to church even if you do,
