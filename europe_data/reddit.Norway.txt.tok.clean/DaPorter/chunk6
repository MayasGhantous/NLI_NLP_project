  i said nothing of the sort . 
  i even refer to sd as the far right in my previous posts as well . 
  how to do you propose is solve my problem ? 
   `` come election time , who can i vote for ? 
  if i decide that immigration policy is the most important issues , '', 
  i have n't checked but that 's probably accurate . 
  what i am referring to tho is polls from this fall where they range from 20-27 % . 
  a party that holds support from a quarter of the population ca n't possibly be described as the `` extreme right '' . 
  time to smell the coffee . 
  sd has support from over 20 % of the swedish population . 
  you calling that `` the extreme right '' makes me think you are as delusional as l\u00f6fven . 
  i do n't know what point you are trying to make with the rest of your post . 
   `` some countries succumb to the demands from the extreme right and some do n't . 
   norway celebrated the occupation of nazis with a marching band . 
  denmark laid down and  cried . 
  poland opened their arms to the occupation . 
  it 's just a cultural thing . 
  like sd likes  to say . '', 
  if anything you are making my point for me . 
  i personally identify as a socialist , but i 'm a pragmatic over ideological , and i do n't see how sweden possibly can sustain 350k new refugees/immigrants over the course of 2 years . 
  that 's a lot of people that ca n't possibly be provided with much of an opportunity to `` delta i det svenska samheldet '' . 
  come election time , who can i vote for ? 
  if i decide that immigration policy is the most important issues , i would much rather have a moderate politician ( and rational ) politician that would promote a responsible and humane approach to the immigration problem , rather than a bunch of hicks and retards that piggy back other ill conceived propositions, 
  this was on the show skavlan where he had an appearance to talk about his decision to to have a reelection , because they where unhappy with the powerful position the previous election had afforded sd . 
  the proposition was later abandoned because they , in my opinion , realized that it would if anything just give even more voters to sd . 
  [ this is the clip ] ( https://youtu.be/poinvweqjw0?t=519 ) i may have misrepresented slightly . 
  the host refers to a previous visit to the show by the minister of finance . 
  that was actually the one that said that she had chosen to close the blinds , rather than the see the sd rep. across the hall . 
  he poses the question to l\u00f6fven if thought this was reasonable reaction . 
  l\u00f6fven replies that he and the minister of finance are both deeply ideological , and that they as politicians should not be forced to cooperate with people that are so far apart from themselves politically . 
  when pressed further , he says that he might not himself closed the blinds , he would perhaps not even acknowledge that they where there . 
  you are completely missing the point . 
  what 's happening in denmark is that otherwise moderate politicians are actually listening to their voter base and providing an immigration critical and moderate political option to folkeparitet and the far right . 
  in sweden , if you are critical against the current policies , there are no other alternatives than the far right . 
  i heard a journalist on swedish p1 , seriously pose the question `` are we all turning in to sweden democrats ? '' . 
  this in relation to the statements that `` sweden is full '' from `` migrasjonsv\u00e4rket '' . 
  a practical concern , about the state agencies ability to accommodate more people , was warped in to a support for right wing politics . 
  as retarded as that question is , there is actually some truth to it , because the shortsighted tunnel vision of the current government and the lack of a moderate ( and competent ) political option , it will more than likely turn people in to sd voters in the end . 
  stefan l\u00f6fven went on the biggest scandinavian talk show and more or less bragged , that one of the representatives of his party that had her office across the hall from a representative from the sweden democrats would always keep the blinds down . 
  in protest . 
  she refused to look upon the evil that shared an office in the same building . 
  `` pretend they are not there ! '', 
  the prime minister thought that was a reasonable way to deal with a political opponent . 
  the pure incompetence of this government will be felt in sweden for decades . 
  `` citizens of 40 different countries '' , is not the same as `` 40 different countries '' . 
  cameltoed birch is the finest of materials , and in the land of norway , only the best will do . 
  i wonder how they can be so stupid as to think that excluding sd from these talks will decrease their legitimacy rather than increase it . 
  they really are shoveling voters to sd . 
  yeah people really reveled in this stuff . 
  at that time the lists where made available without any conditions and most newspapers built databases you could search online . 
  i think 2010/2009 the rules changed and you were n't able to access the whole database like before . 
  the major new outlets still request information about celebrities and other public personas .

  your post is literally the opposite of right wing persecution complex . 
  i 've never heard about skyddaskogen , but i will admit that i 'm basing a lot of this on the numbers quoted by wikipedia . 
  if you look up the `` skogsstatistisk \u00e5rsbok 2014 '' skogsstyrelsen is currently classing [ about 1,7 mil ha ] ( http://www.skogsstyrelsen.se/myndigheten/statistik/amnesomraden/tillstandet-i-skogen/tabeller--figurer/ ) as old forest . 
  that 's about 7,3 percent of the total forested area . 
  however , old forest , is not necessarily natural forest . 
  what are your sources for 3,3 and 12 % ? 
  the question really is how much of the old forest can be classed as natural forest . 
  this has been lumbered regularly is what it means and is part of a focused managed forestry . 
  climb a mountain inn norrland and look out at the unfathomably vast fields of pine and spruce . 
  whatever grows along those swamps and ravines is literally a drop in ocean . 
  i 'll reiterate , most swedes have no idea and perpetuate a fantasy of a country that puts nature first and industry 2nd , while in reality most ( practically all of it ) of sweden 's nature has been freely exploited ( and still is ) by the power and forestry companies . 
  i 'm not saying it 's unsustainable , but they way it 's being done is terrible for biodiversity . 
  i 'm not misunderstanding , like i said i believe you are overstating the `` wildness '' of sweden 's forests . 
  sweden in general is pretty shoddy at protecting it 's nature ( or has been at least ) . 
  a good example is that most every major ( and minor ) river has been dammed without making any sort of allowance for spawning fish . 
  there 's a push to rectify this now , but as of this moment the situation is very poor . 
  same goes for fishing regulations in the baltic sea , gulf of bothnia and kattegat wich historically has been very poorly managed . 
  from skogsstyrlesen . 
  ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/skog_i_sverig ) here it 's being stated that the `` unused '' area of forest is [ about 85000 ha . 
  lumbered and taken away resulting in a dramatically reduced biodiversity compared to natural forest . 
  a natural lifecyle of a pine tree would see it grow for centuries and spend several more centuries decomposing on the forest floor . 
  hardwoods like oak can grow for up to a millennia before starting to decompose . 
  it 's easy to mistake lush mixed forest as being `` natural '' but that 's largely because most of us have never seen the real thing to compare it with . 
  i 'm just pointing out that you ( like many other swedes ) are overstating the `` wildness '' of your forests . 
  97 % is defined as cultured forest . 
  forest that is managed and lumbered regularly . 
   a lot of these forests are wild growth , though . 
  i see hear a lot of swedes saying similar things , but the fact of the matter is that natural forest is less than [ 3 percent of the total forested area . 
  97 percent of forest is sweden is cultured . 
  what remains of old growth is mostly mountain birch and natural forest is extremely limited . 
  there are forest that looks like `` wild growth '' with mixed pine and birch and aspen but it 's all part of managed landscape . 
  it was not meant to witch hunt you i just wanted to show the reasoning i was given from the mod team . 
  as i wrote in the reply via pm i understand the reasoning even if i do n't completely agree with it . 
  this was in no way meant as an attack on anyone so if it came across as such i apologize . 
  i appreciate the show of transparency by providing me with the reasoning for removal and as such i dint see any harm in reposting it . 
  you ca n't give a conclusion based on admittedly wrongful assumptions backed by calculation of irrelevant numbers and claim that your argument still stands . 
  nobody was suggestion the level of production you `` proved '' ca n't be done . 
  i 'm just pointing out that your calculation was done with completely irrelevant numbers . 
  but what you are proposing is not what is being proposed . 
  it 's supposed to give access to power at peak consumption by storing excess production at times of lesser load .
