  we 're large on [ hydro ] . 
  but we ca n't power europe ourselves , '' he added . 
   the green battery idea could become reality but `` not tomorrow , '' lont said . 
  `` you do n't want to create a revolution . 
  you want to do it as an evolution . '' the article does moderate the hyperbole of the headline in raising these issues same as you . 
  and i get your point but your calculations assume that the need that it 's supposed to fill is the entire energy consumption . 
  the idea proposed by the article however is a bit different . 
  i 'd love to see the actual math , but besides that i think there 's a few things to point out . 
  it 's not intended to power all of europe but rather to be another part of the energy mix as we move to towards the final goal of 100 % renewable . 
  it 's also a proof of concept that kinetically stored energy can work to balance out other less predictable sources of energy generation . 
  lastly , the potential for this technology in mountainous norway is huge , and if the suggestion is to pump water as power storage , you do n't even need a naturally occurring reservoir of water , you just need a mountain with suitable topography . 
  which should be in plenty supply all over central europe as well as norway . 
  it really is . 
  i 'm fascinated by the concept of kinetically storing energy , it just seems like such am obvious way to store surplus energy that 's nondegradable . 
  i guess the big question is what kind of efficiency you get on the whole system . 
  nord.link is the single biggest power infrastructure project currently being undertaken in norway . 
  huge contracts being awarded to norwegian and european contractors to in order to complete it . 
  i have a conference call with a project leader for one of the contractors for the land based installation in noway later today actually . 
  this contract alone is valued at close to 1 billion nok . 
  i think this is the first time my idle reddit browsing is actually work related . 
  this is just malm\u00f6 . 
  further more there have been reports of car fires in g\u00f6teborg , stockholm , varberg , norrk\u00f6ping , skara . 
  even in my little hick town of ljusdal in northern sweden there has been several car fires the last month . 
  this is not reported on national level and i assume there are several more incident gone unreported . 
  edit : apparently something similar has been [ going on in the netherlands ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4jgmxw/car_fires_turning_into_a_dutch_plague_100s/ ),

  [ perhaps , but statistically i get to stay one for quite a bit longer than my eastern european counterparts . 
  i 'm obviously taking the piss . 
  poe 's law i guess . 
  does this correlate with an increase of stolen cars in the rest of europe ? 
  sweden 's numbers on the other hand ( literally ) is living proof that smugness is good for your health . 
  why did he stay then in norway to drive a taxi ? 
  why did n't he use his credentials to work in poland ? 
  why quit a doctors job , and move to another country before having employment ? 
  any degree you do n't use quickly diminish in value , so why would he let it die while he drive a cab in 10 years ? 
  did he speak norwegian fluently when he arrived ? 
  there 's a lot of questions that need to be answered here before you can make sweeping generalizations about norwegian society ... 
   be open to individualism/people trying to excel . 
  i think you are the one misunderstanding . 
  the law of jante is massively overstated , people are encouraged to be individualistic and to pursue their interests and dreams . 
  the way law of jante applies is a disdain for empty talk . 
  people do n't give a shit what you say you can do , or what you claim to have done . 
  what matters is what you can demonstrate . 
  talk is cheap . 
  excuse my english . . but it 's fucking idiotic to complain that a career in norway is to unforgiving if you do n't speak the language , and then turn around and say it 's too much of a bother and it not worth to learn it . 
  that in fact demonstrates another way the law of jante is applied which is our intolerance for entitlement . 
  there is no disdain for people that want to excel , and there 's not really any belief that everyone is of equal ability . 
  as a person of exceptional ability you will be well rewarded in norway . 
  there is however a strong focus on equal worth and equal opportunities . 
  in regards to language in most instances you will be less useful to your employer if you do n't speak the language , same as anywhere . 
  further more in order to be successful in a foreign environment you need to to integrate in to the culture , and the key to that is language . 
  i 've acquaintances that spent time in norwegian prisons and through them i 've heard about this very thing happening . 
  inmates that prefer to spend the winter in a nice cozy jail rather than going back to some shit hole in the eastern blocks and spend their winter freezing their ass off . 
  hardened criminals from other countries ( with tougher underworlds and penal systems ) laugh at our system and treat a year or two in our jails as a sabbatical from their day jobs . 
  it 's also a common theme that addicts that spend the summer living on the streets , purposely aim to go to jail over the winter for some rehab and a warm bed . 
  a break . 
  it was a juxtaposition ? 
  well as long as statistics keep improving it makes sense , from a utilitarian stand point . 
  and as a society our decisions should be utilitarian and economic . 
  however as an individual i do n't follow utilitarian morals , and to me then intention matters . 
  if person intends to harm me or someone i love , i think they deserve to punished accordingly . 
  and yet in norway this field of law is called `` strafferett '' ( penalty law ) , and the specific laws of penalty are called `` straffeloven '' ( the penalty law ) , and the sentence is called `` straff '' ( penalty ) . 
  i guess the big cultural difference between scandinavia and the us , is the prison system it self , which interestingly is called `` kriminalomsorgen '' ( criminal care ) . 
  kriminalomsorgen is tasked with exacting punishment , but also to rehabilitate . 
  punishment is an essential part of our justice system . 
  seeing gay men make out also makes me uncomfortable . 
  . . but i 'm not arguing against gay marriage , same as i 'm not arguing against they way we organize our penal system . 
  what i 'm saying is that there 's a difference on how we react to something as individuals and how we rationalize something as a society . 
  yes . 
  i 'm not arguing against that . 
  i 'm sure it is , if you analyze it from a social-economic perspective and even more so if you analyze it from a utilitarian standpoint . 
  but intuitively as person , i want to punish those who wronged me or my loved ones . 
  intuitively you would want to punish criminals . 
  our prison system is ridiculous and makes no sense . 
  there is even a two year education with full salary in order to become a warden . 
  ... but it 's one of those things , the results seem to be pretty good in regards to the statistics , so better not mess with it . 
   `` the decision by stoxx , which manages europe 's top benchmark stock indexes , was announced on tuesday after deutsche bank had lost almost 90 percent of the stock value it had during its 2007 peak '' i thought germany 's banking sector was pretty healthy ?

  she does n't really have an irish accent tho . . she sounds like an practiced expat .

  yeah this is bullshit . 
  in any thread about immigration in this sub there 's a multitude of opinions on the matter , and many are indeed very opposed . 
  / r/europe has no default stance on the issue . 
  it might have a leaning towards critical if anything . 
  the mods do moderate ( remove ) threads about immigration to limit the volume of discussion . 
  i do n't agree with it always but i understand why and i do n't believe it 's primarily politically motivated . 
  most finns i know embrace melancholy like a warm blanket . 
  what 's the difference between fjell and mountain ? 
  at least to my knowledge it 's the direct translation of the word . 
  what 's proposed is to move the border so [ the peak of the mountain or the summit ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@69.3087804,21.2653668,15z/data=!5m1!1e4 ) is on the finnish side of the border rather than on the norwegian side . 
  the background for this is that finland 's highest point is at this border section , and is a rather anticlimactically not the summit of the mountain . 
  being only 1331 meters it has no significance in norwegian context , but as finland 's highest point is only 1324 and a few meters down the mountain side it would have huge significance to them . 
  it all started with a facebook group set up by bj\u00f8rn geirr harsson a veteran from the `` norwegian cartography office '' and was since picked up by local politicians and now recently also gained attention at national level . 
  we rather like our finnish brothers , and especially in the north where we share a bond of a common experience of living at the end of the world in a place only really suited for reindeer and mosquito .
