  surely norway is the obvious choice here . 
  calling / u/shitty _ watercolour, 
  so about 1,6 litres per 100 km ? 
  edit : i mean per 10 km . . 
  in any case that 's about 3 times the fuel consumption of a modern commuter . 
  whats the gas millage on it ? 
  anything other than on american gas prices would make that thing a bottomless money pit . 
  but there 's the luas , and the dublin busses !, 
  53 million < 323 thousand . 
  you mean the immigrant funnel ? 
  blow it up 2016 !, 
   girl on the bottom [ however ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/however ) no i mean the picture below ... 
  your reading comprehension is wanting ... 
  the girl on the bottom however is black . 
  i think you are actually the one in need of re-watching this . 
  it 's nothing to do with schengen its about the carnet needed to bring their equipment cross the border . 
  switzerland ( as mentioned ) is part of schengen but in order to bring their equipment in to the country they would need a carnet . 
  it 's about vat and tax , not freedom of movement . 
  it sounds like a carnet , which is a massive hassle . 
  that was awesome . 
  / r/girlsmirin /, 
   and simulatenously excuses the otherwise strange ideas of fringe anti-immigration parties . 
  i wish more people realized this . 
  i my view the fallout from this is that we promote deeply incompetent politicians , because they somehow have a monopoly on what a growing number of people see to be the most important issues in their country . 
  yeah that 's garbage .

  i have the first hand account from a friend in law enforcement , where they caught a burglar , inside the house he burglarized . 
  he was taken in to custody , but was claiming he was under 15 . 
  the suspect in this case was a newly arrived asylum seeker , and had himself stated his age upon entry to the country . 
  the prosecutor was not willing to prosecute the the suspect and no attempts where made to determine if he was indeed older than his stated age . 
  my friend personally gaged his age at well over 20 . 
  while i agree with you that there are a lot of articles here about immigration and related issues , i must say that i have experienced on several occasions that my posts have been removed with little or no reason . 
  i usually post articles from big scandinavian news outlets so as far as we can trust what remains of press etiquette the sources should check out fine . 
  this very thread have now been removed by the moderation team with no stated reason . 
  i cant find it either . 
  wtf . 
  norwegian state broadcaster . 
  rinkeby , husby , tensta and kista are neighboring areas . 
  but yes , this particular incident did indeed take place in husby .

  i say go for it . 
  you do n't know if you do n't try . 
  if you are standing in helsingborg you 'll do fine with a medium powered one . . 
  getting ready for the holy wars . 
  yeah exactly . 
  cattle are domesticated from aurochs . 
  not sure what you are looking for ? 
  it 's sustainable as far as anyone can tell , and i do n't find it immoral . 
  morality is largely a subjective thing so i doubt i can convince you it is not immoral and you certainly wo n't convince me it is . 
  the aurochs where pushed to extinction by hunting and loss of habitat . 
  norwegian fisheries ( including whale hunting ) are some of the strongest regulated fisheries in the world and quotas are evaluated on a yearly basis . 
  [ brutal ] ( http://woundcaresociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/scarring-from-burns.jpg ), 
  yeah ? 
  well , you know , that 's just like uh , your opinion , man . 
   `` i do n't understand the problem of hunting 2000 norwegians per year when they are estimated at over 5 million '' ? 
  if hunting other people for sustenance had been the norm for the last 10 000 years , sure that would probably have been acceptable as it 's well with in the sustainable range . 
  you are basically stating that this is foremost a moral issue which is fine . 
  you are entitled to your opinion . 
  norway however is sovereign nation that sets the laws that govern our territory and we do not consider the practice of hunting whales as immoral . 
  you know what i stopped posting and reading this sub when `` must warn others '' removed a post i made about national phenomenon of car burnings last year , under the local news guideline . 
  it was first removed for being an undependable source ( despite being aftonbladet , swedens largest newspaper ) and then when reposted it was taken of applying the local news guideline . 
  i have a really hard time accepting that was not due to moral and political bias . 
  saying that tim pool should have been removed because he is not an accredited journalist is just to strange . 
  he is marketing himself as an independent reporter and what he offers is interviews with different people and leaves the judgment up to the viewers . 
  subscribers should be able to judge this content on its own merits using votes and posts . 
  removing low effort blog-spam , yes please , but removing this under the same pretense is bizarre . 
  and again , adding : saying he is inherently unreliable because he took money from inforwars would certainly justify closer vetting of the funding of other news publications as well . 
  when was it removed ? 
   i do n't suppose you have any evidence of that from the past year ? 
  show me the mod logs and lets look at how `` local news '' is applied and i 'll be perfectly happy to point out which stories i think are moderated incorrectly . 
  hey bru u prolly no taht better than me submission removed cuz local news . 
  and adding again , two mods participate in this thread and both seem to be going out of their way to be as arrogant and condescending as possible . 
  you even purposely expand me saying `` mods like you '' to envelop `` all mods of / r/europe '' . 
  and i 'm not saying he is pushing an ideology , i 'm saying he is doing a piss poor job at being an objective moderator . 
  i think we should be more concerned about your bias than tim pools . 
  just to add i think mods like you that moderate this sub according to obvious political and moral bias has ruined this sub and made sure that there are no longer any real or interesting discussions taking place here , only page up and page down with meaningless fluff . 
  why do you consider him `` less than credible ? '', 
  sweet summer child . 
  i do n't think anyone outside the us calls them french fries . 
  hello r/europe . 
  ** i like this place , there is good discussion here , interesting news , fun links and many other things that keeps me coming back again and again . 
  a lot of people here , are worried about politics , about immigration , socio-economics and cultural friction caused by it . 
  i think it 's good that we discuss these things openly . 
  but in this discussion there are certain things that stand out , that degrades the entire debate no matter what your opinion is : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/267mmq/reurope_what_does_an_average_family_home_look/chontsu http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/260a0q/how_immigrants_are_changing_swedens_welfare_state/chmyn06 / u/ramblinrambo is not alone in spouting this kind of hateful garbage , and i think we as a community need to make it clear that this type of hate speech is not accepted , no matter what the subject at hand is . 
  let 's keep our debates clean and free of irrational hatred . 
  thank you for your time , and stay awesome !, 
  edit : just to be clear , i 'm not calling for censorship of these posts . 
  i 'm asking people to not simply pass it by when they see it . 
  like / u/my _ baby_ate_dingos says  the racists must be free to spout their shitty opinions , and the rest of society must be free to show them facts and stats and science to explain how shitty and inaccurate their opinions are . 
  voice your opinions . 
  i have some time to kill on my morning commute and i want some podcasts in the topics of news , politics , history and current events .
