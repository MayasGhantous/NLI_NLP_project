  depending on what country you are in lots of things on reddit are not legal . 
  believe me the number one fright for norway is oil drying up over night so we often do `` how fucked are we if that happened ? '', 
  tests and they always come back `` things would be ok , things would get sorta bad but life would go on . '', 
  this scare will hopefully make things even more diverse though . 
  wind and lego is your thing . 
  we are at 99 % renewable energy already so we already won . 
  if anyone need us we will be at the border chucking rocks at sweden while drinking overtaxed booze . 
  someone in your family had something horrible done to them . 
  you can chose to punish and increase the chance that this will happen to another family so that they too have to live thought what you did . 
  or you can try and help them out and make it much less likely for what you suffered to happen to another family but there is much less punishment for the prisoner . 
  is punishment still what you want ? 
  this is one of my favorite subs ( even though you are all eu loving oddballs ) . 
  just seems to have been a few mod incidents lately and i would hate to see this sub go bad . 
  i might be repeating myself , never been good at writing stuff , but even if being fair was n't a priority , mistakes are double the mod actions of normal with having to rectify and whatnot is n't it ? 
  is n't that alone worth looking into instead of just rectifying , apologizing and moving on ? 
  i 'm disappointed that he does n't spell usa with different shooting positions in a village people ymca way . 
  all over this thread there is tons of ` oh mods made a mistake , it happens ' for bans , deletions and whatnot . 
  if mistakes happen this often is n't is a sign of a bigger problem ? 
  i do n't know what it coult be , an agenda , overzealous modding , pc police , or that the rules `` could be slightly clearer '' as you said but there is no doubt it 's not just ` mistakes happen ' but an actual issue . 
  seriously , it rose by like a whole % and that % is localized in one area . 
  it 's not a union if you do n't learn from each other . 
  you get their humour , they learn to dance flamenco . 
  it 's perfect !, 
  gotcha , you do n't like jokes . 
  we did n't even try and we already won best nutcase in scandinavia !, 
  do you even try any more sweden ? 
  would 50k $ make you change that comment ? 
  15 $ now . 
  the nok took a dive lately with the fall in oil price . 
  reading what you write i 'm even more surprised the number is n't higher . 
  i knew they earned more but not a day pay in an hour . 
  i 'm actually surprised it is n't ' higher . 
  i had little to no idea who some of the groups mentioned in the article were so i googled and found out how each group describe them self . 
  figured others might want to read it too . 
  ** breaking the silence ** `` collects testimonies of soldiers who served in the occupied territories during the second intifada , '' claiming that the `` testimonies portray a ... grim picture of questionable orders in many areas regarding palestinian civilians [ which ] demonstrate the depth of corruption which is spreading in the israeli military ... israeli society continues to turn a blind eye , and to deny that which happens in its name . '' ** b\u2019tselem ** : acts primarily to change israeli policy in the occupied territories and ensure that its government , which rules the occupied territories , protects the human rights of residents there and complies with its obligations under international law . '' ** adalah ** an independent human rights organization and legal center '' that `` promote [ s ] and defend [ s ] the rights of palestinian arab citizens of israel . '' ** terrestrial jerusalem ** to identify and track the full spectrum of developments in jerusalem that could impact either the political process or permanent status options , destabilize the city or spark violence , or create humanitarian crises . '' ** rabbis for human rights ** `` the only rabbinic voice of conscience in israel '' and to serve as `` a shofar for the distribution of information about human rights in israel and in the occupied palestinian territories . '' ** coalition of women for peace . 
  ** is an umbrella organization of women 's groups in israel . 
  a feminist organization against the occupation of palestine and for a just peace . '' . 
  cwp says that it is `` committed to ending the occupation and creating a more just society , while enhancing women 's inclusion and participation in the public discourse '' . 
  copyright and licensing issues most likely . 
  netflix probably has to buy the license for each show for every country they want to show in and that gets expensive fast . 
  not being a pirate and be up to date on shows are very often a paradox state for all but a few shows . 
   norway is the best country ever and we horrible danish people can learn much from the amazing accomplishments of norway . 
  more or less , i 'm paraphrasing slightly . 
  you will save yourself a lot of annoyance by accepting that we are rarely ` europe ' on this sub . 
  maybe we can become the new russia . 
  i say we anex . . uhm . . iceland !, 
  nah , we feel more like that boring kid that do n't want to do something stupid even if all the other kids tells us `` it will be so awesome though '' and `` you should totally come '' . 
  sure it would be cool to be hanging out with ya 'll but looking over and seeing that jimmy just broke his arm in a nasty way and people running around trying to decide who is to blame for this we are ok with being boring for now . 
  i like that it 's a place where there are europeans talking about european things . 
  i dislike that it feels so heavily pro-eu . 
  before we were n't in europe ( people use europe when meaning eu ) and now we are n't a part of scandinavia , great . 
  haha , germans not working he must be joking . . wait germans joking . . 
  the fuck kinda paradox have we stumbled onto ? 
  checks are so weird to me . 
  it 's like someone saying they still use the telegraph . 
  norway is mainly debit i think seeing how you can pay with debit even in food truck thing . 
  older generation however tend to be the cash users . 
  the only times i got cash is when i 've done some shopping for my parents and they pay me back or im low on cash . 
  helps me keep track a lot easier . 
  opposed , he is new but also dares to put himself out there . 
  sadly the new issue made him fuck up this time . 
  i still think he can be a great mod if he takes some of the pointers people have to hearth . 
  if it is a comment he can do what he want really . 
  this however is a bit more official , seeing how he distinguished himself , / r/europe thread . 
  it should either be in one language or all the languages . 
   have you imagined what it would be like all those people posting comments in two languages ? 
  a sharp decline in comments ? 
  and idea could maybe be a res feature where it just blocked one half of duel language comments for easier readability . 
  the only thing i found on doing a quick google was some page on abbreviations used in german apartment ads . 
  the page translates them into english and do use the cold/warm terms but with the added explanation on what that means . 
  cold is the base cost , warm is all including shite like water , el , internet . . 
  i think . 
  i imagine it comes from what the price is with or without heating ? 
  we do n't want to drag our one night stands home to wake our parents ? 
   sweat a typo or some sort of pun i 'm not getting ? 
  we can share , finland gets the east side , we get the west side . 
  i think the french fries them self were ok and ` normal ' , it was the condiment on them was the real shocker . 
  these were larger than sugar grains i think and with the sweet ketchup i really thought the grains were sugar instead of salt and that there was nothing wrong with the ketchup at all . 
  might be the standard salt grain size though , still surprising . 
  look at this intimate fucker all up in peoples bizz . 
  agreed , thought i do n't mind dual language comments , even if i do n't really see the point of those either , the titles should be in one language the majority knows , not minority . 
  french fires in denmark . 
  the salt grains were huge and the ketchup really sweet . 
  this was probably 10 years ago now though , maybe they have changed their weird ways . 
  i think the leopard is my favorite . 
  think of all the jobs this creates and the cool title of ` claw runner ', 
  eu union is n't protecting the us economy or what ? 
  thank god there are the odd actual good question where googling is n't the best option or i would lose all faith in selfposts on there . 
  is it just me or is the federalist on a massive rise ? 
  i felt like i saw a comment every so often before but but now it 's a common sight . 
   last thing we need is a group of immigrants who are impossible to integrate , do n't understand our language , do n't share our values and religion . 
  i 've heard similar arguments used by those who are against immigrants in all shapes used against the polish and lithuanian workers traveling here . 
  we took care of all the nazi zombies so no longer works on modern norway . 
  http://www.engadget.com/2014/05/16/nsa-bugged-cisco-routers/  here 's how it works : shipments of computer network devices ( servers , routers , etc , ) being delivered to our targets throughout the world are intercepted . 
  next , they are redirected to a secret location where tailored access operations/access operations ( ao-s326 ) employees , with the support of the remote operations center ( s321 ) , enable the installation of beacon implants directly into our targets ' electronic devices . 
  these devices are then re-packaged and placed back into transit to the original destination . 
  all of this happens with the support of intelligence community partners and the technical wizards in tao . 
  personally i always felt like ff was a working ie with addons . 
  still felt slow to start up and use compared to my prefered browser of opera . 
  sadly opera was n't too stable when i came to flash and such so i used ff on the side .
