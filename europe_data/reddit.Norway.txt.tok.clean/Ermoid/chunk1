but why is it better to join nato ? 
  finland , and sweden for that matter , are not post-soviet countries and do n't have substantial russian minorities . 
  they are likely to manage to stay out of a conventional between russia and nato . 
  and even though sweden is no major military power , two relatively weak countries still bring more deterrence than one . 
   `` the inconvenient truth is that people are still coming to europe , because the wars are still ongoing , '' vincent cochetel , the director of the europe branch of the unhcr , the un 's refugee agency , told journalists . 
  the inconvenient truth is that people are still coming to europe because they are not satisfied with the economic conditions either in their home countries , or in regional countries in which those fleeing from war have already found safety . 
   `` to call them illegal migrants is a short-cut by european leaders , '' cochetel added . 
  well what are they then ? 
  legal migrants ? 
  no one has invited them , and storming into another country without permission is simply ** not ** legal migration . 
  refugees ? 
  the vast majority of them either come from peaceful countries or have already found safety in turkey . 
  thus they have no legitimate reason to flee to europe . 
  tourists ? 
  some of them have indeed behaved like disappointed tourists in the north of europe , so i can forgive people for suspecting it . 
  but still the truth is they are n't coming on tourist visas . 
  i guess the conclusion must be that illegal migrants are exactly what they tend to be . 
   `` i do n't see why europe ca n't manage that '' . 
  well . 
  i would n't either if i had belonged to a class of limousine liberals who live safely isolated from migration-related problems , and who make a living of being generous and `` humane '' on behalf of these people while sending the bill for that to those in society who are less fortunate . 
   cochetel said countries , particularly in central europe , that are reluctant to participate in the relocation scheme should take in refugees based on european solidarity . 
   `` solidarity worked for hungarian refugees in 1956 , worked for people fleeing czechoslovakia in 1968 and for polish who fled in 1981 , '' he said . 
  indeed it did . 
  because those people left for countries with a certain cultural and geographic proximity to themselves . 
  they did n't storm into faraway countries like saudi arabia , oman or qatar because the living standards were higher there . 
  and for a person who is working for the unhcr , maybe it 's time for him to draw attention to the fact that none of those countries have taken in a single syrian refugee . 
  i 'm not saying europe should shut the door completely without exception , but other countries have responsibilities as well . 
  honestly i was n't that surprised . 
  a kremlin aide had actually [ hinted that a russian intervention in pro-russian regions was possible if the association agreement was signed . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/22/ukraine-european-union-trade-russia ) and russia had already shown with the intervention in georgia some years earlier as a response to that country 's western aspirations that their threshold for using force against neighbors is low . 
  but austria , macedonia and the other balkan countries have made this agreement about closed borders as a preventive measure . 
  because they feared that they themselves would become bottlenecks if germany suddenly decided to close its borders . 
   eu us putting greece in a really fucked up situation . 
  i 've seen the boats land on the islands . 
  i 've met and talked to the refugees myself . 
  most of these guys are running for their lives . 
  with all respect for what you have seen , these people are overwhelmingly ** not ** running for their lives . 
  there is no war in turkey , right ? 
  they are coming for economic reasons , not because they flee for their lives . 
   it is completely unfair to leave a country like greece on it 's own to deal with a humanitatian crisis . 
  it is n't on its own . 
  [ extra aid has already been allocated to them , ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/02/refugee-crisis-europe-eu-countries-greece-receive-700m-extra-aid-funds ) , and macedonia is still allowing in a certain number every day . 
  obviously it 's hard for them though , especially because of the problems they already have there . 
  but i hope the chaotic scenes we see in greece now might help to decrease this problem for them and the rest of europe in the medium term , since those scenes may deter people from making the trip to greece and europe in the first place . 
   there was no false hope . 
  eu had a clear roadmap for ukraine , but viktor yanukovych put his personal and corrupt interests above those of his country , and under great pressure from russia has backed out of a trade deal with the european union . 
  there was indeed a false hope , because the eu did n't communicate to the ukrainian government and people that an attempt on eu integration would likely be met with a russian aggression that ukraine was not at all prepared to handle . 
  also , it 's extremely unlikely that the eu would have followed that roadmap in the foreseeable future , given that we are talking about a country of 45 million people with huge corruption problems and a gdp per capita closer to sub-saharan africa than to eu members . 
   the war-torn country is the direct result of russian invasion , occupation , and annexation of sovereign country , not eu demanding from countries wishing to join the eu commitment to fundamental democratic principles , and proposing very clear criteria for the steps to get closer to the union . 
  obviously russia is the culprit here . 
  and as i wrote , i support the sanctions against them . 
  i criticize the eu for giving the ukrainian people the false hope that integration with western institutions would n't lead to russian aggression , like it did in georgia some years earlier . 
   all these variations of frequently repeated and dishonest argument `` we should have predicted russian reaction '' is one of the most vile attempts to treat sovereign countries as russia 's property , subaltern realities , or merely their `` buffer state '' , and whitewash any crimes committed by putin 's regime . 
  i absolutely do n't think so . 
  i actually think it 's necessary to sanction the shit out of russia for what they have done , in order to decrease its ability to finance more aggression against neighboring countries in the future . 
  but the fact is that russian aggression against ukraine was more predictable than most western leaders would like to admit . 
  and the eu failed to be honest about this to the ukrainians , instead promising them a rosy future that was unrealistic . 
  finally someone tells it like it is . 
  strange that it had to be mr. juncker of all people . 
  in my view , the eu and nato have given the ukrainian people a large amount of false hope for years , and offered them expectations that in no way had a chance of being fulfilled . 
  regards to the eu , it gave the ukrainians during the euromaidan an impression that if only the association agreement was signed and the government changed , the country 's economy would somehow magically turn into a new poland , and be on a secure track to eu membership . 
  this despite the fact that ukraine is a country that is [ even more corrupt than russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index#2015 ) , and has a gdp per capita [ similar to countries like uzbekistan , nigeria and vietnam . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita ) the chance for ukraine to become a member of the eu in the foreseeable future was really pure fiction from the very beginning . 
  regards to nato , ukraine was n't explicitly promised membership , and there was little popular support for it . 
  but at the same time , the insistence on ukraine 's right to choose its own security status was unrealistic too , since a russian military reaction to prevent potential ukrainian nato membership was easy to anticipate , especially because of the russian military prescence in crimea , and in the light of what happened in georgia some years earlier . 
  note that i am ** not ** defending russia or the old regime or their actions . 
  and i support the sanctions since it 's the only way to diminish russia 's ability to commit the acts that we have seen over the last two years . 
  but the western institutions , and especially the eu , gave the ukrainians highly unrealistic expectations all the way since the euromaidan started . 
  the result is a war-torn country with a deeply dissatisfied and disappointed population . 
  it 's positive that juncker now tells it like it is , but that should have been done already at the start of the ukrainian crisis . 
  yeah . 
  obviously to a certain extent sweden has itself to blame for the amount of refugees who have come there . 
  they have flagged an open-door policy for decades , and already in 2013 they decided not only to give all syrians who entered the country permanent residency automatically , but also the unconditional right for them to bring in their families as well . 
  i guess the number of people coming there would 've been more in line with that of its neighbors if they had n't acted so recklessly . 
  indeed . 
  a lot of them have behaved like disappointed tourists , and either do not qualify for refugee status , or have travelled through one safe country after another in order to get to sweden and other countries . 
  but unfortunately , the fact that they are opportunists does n't help sweden much . 
  and an attempt to unite europe with russia will end in ... ? 
  i do n't think i want to know the answer . 
  i said :  to an extent yes . 
  but according to the same logic , the us is a gigantic free rider on sweden for letting them carry the burden of a massive wave of refugees fleeing from a ** region ** that the us above all has contributed to destabilizing . 
  most of the refugees are not syrian , and a lot of them are from iraq and afghanistan . 
  also , the syrian situation did n't develop in a vacuum . 
   i remember when obama forced assad to start that civil war and for germany to ask for refugees . 
  so you remember things that did n't happen , ** and ** you think that germany will sanction the us just because of what a few redditors said ? 
  do you really think that there will be sanctions on the us because of what a few redditors said ? 
  obviously to a certain extent sweden has itself to blame for the amount of refugees who have come there . 
  they have flagged an open-door policy for decades , and already in 2013 they started to give all syrians who entered the country permanent residency automatically . 
  that 's why they have gotten more than other nordic countries . 
  but unlike the us , where ( if i 'm not mistaken ) most refugees are brought into the country by the authorities , in sweden they themselves have typically come on their own , and it 's often difficult to stop them or send them back . 
  they did n't take them . 
  for the most part they came to sweden on their own . 
  to an extent yes . 
  but according to the same logic , the us is a ** gigantic ** free rider on sweden for letting them carry the burden of a massive wave of refugees fleeing from a region that the us above all has contributed to destabilizing . 
  obviously that presence might decrease the chance of russian aggression somewhat . 
  but remember that ukraine also had that military alliance next door . 
  it did n't help them much . 
  also , i responded to the claim that sweden can only afford its welfare programs because of american defence spending ( despite america having no defence obligation towards them ) , which is obviously absurd . 
  if anything , america has made the swedish welfare state less affordable by destabilizing the middle east and giving them a massive refugee crisis . 
  sweden is not a part of nato .
