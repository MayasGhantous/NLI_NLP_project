  and it is still has a quite extensive welfare state . 
   `` the numbers of refugees wanting to go home is growing every week -- ** once they discover they ca n't bring their families here , they give up on germany ** , '' said ardalan hassan , the head of the dania travel agency in the wedding district of berlin . 
  i think this is the main lesson to take from this . 
  adult men have typically travelled to germany on their own with the thought of bringing their families over once they have made it there . 
  take away that right , and it will be much less practical and affordable for people to come . 
   the increase in the number of refugees returning home could offer some unexpected relief to chancellor angela merkel she , frankly , does ** not ** deserve that . 
  but in all fairness her countrymen certainly do . 
  after all , not many people will ask them their side of the story if the question is more likely to be answered with rocks than with words . 
  those scenes are so beautiful that no nearby country will ever allow it to be independent . 
  and to create a safe haven for swedes when they eventually start fleeing the mess . 
   many are refugees fleeing war in the middle east , while others are escaping human rights abuses in afghanistan , eritrea and other conflict zones . 
  well , if they are refugees fleeing from that then why the heck do they take with them the ** same behavior they are fleeing from ? 
  ** i have no words . 
  amen . 
  i wish this could be done by other european countries instead . 
  i think it 's not safe to rely on a faraway country that is increasingly indebted and that might have its own agendas and interests in mind . 
  after all , it would take one day for the us to leave nato , but many years for other nato members to fill the resulting gap . 
  realistically though , this will either be done mainly by the us , or not done at all . 
  and i definitely understand why it is being requested . 
   trump the second most anti-war candidate , he 's never going to use a nuke . 
  he is on the record of having supported the wars he now claims always to have opposed . 
  also he seems like an extremely impulsive personality . 
  looking at his reactions when he feels `` insulted '' by individuals , it 's scary to think about how he will react when feeling `` insulted '' by countries . 
   criticizing a presidential candidate for being narcissistic or brash is absurd . 
  are you , personally , comfortable with handing a nuclear arsenal over to someone widely suspected of being a pathological narcissist ? 
  then where will germans flee ? 
  and will it turn into neu-deutschland ? 
  but hitler is first and formost known for the type of atrocities that putin has n't even been close to committing . 
  i think comparing putin with mussolini makes much more sense . 
  but even a person who is 100 % right on the issues might still be disliked for personality reasons . 
  given trump 's extreme narcissism and brashness , even those who agree with his policies might at the same time be scared as hell of giving that man control over thousands of nuclear weapons . 
  why ? 
  putin is a repulsive human being . 
  meanwhile his actions , although ** very ** unsympathetic , have made his country a powerful player on the world stage , he has been repeatedly successful in outsmarting his western opponents , and he is more popular than ever at home . 
  obviously his actions have been stupid in terms of the economic consequences . 
  but since he happens to lead a country where the electorate prioritizes more territory over more money , he himself has nonetheless ended up stronger than ever . 
  it 's not zig-zagging to express recognition of putin 's political skills while at the same time recognizing him as an unsympathetic human being . 
  yeah . 
  obviously they do n't want to see the societies they fled from being recreated in their new home countries . 
  in other words , both americans and europeans will get a chance do what they enjoy the most . 
  i think it 's impossible to expect germany to have any control over this situation when they do n't even have control over the situation unfolding in their own country . 
   reason why germany sends ukrains back ? 
  fucking arabs man ... because the risk of deportation being met with a violent reaction is ** significantly ** lower when it comes to them . 
  if they want to avoid deportation they should probably behave more like some of their me counterparts . 
  for the sake of the city of iskitim , i really hope the two beavers in the first one are of the opposite sex . 
  but i think the biggest problem with the us interventions is that when you choose to engage in the middle east ( and elsewhere ) , the plans seem to be based on an assumption that mentally speaking the people who live there are americans who just have n't discovered it yet . 
  but the fact is that there is a huge historical and cultural gap between america and the middle east , which is why the american attempts to nation-build and democratize that region have ended in chaos and strengthened the very forces that hate america and threaten us all . 
  i guess that this ignorance is the downside of being located far away from that region of the world . 
  but obviously i guess the upsides of it more than make up for that . 
   ` we will not give up now ' well neither will we !, 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ hope these people should definitely be helped a lot more than they have been . 
  but the solution ca n't be to bring them all to germany , or other european countries for that matter . 
  they must be helped in local countries that have a culture and mindset that is closer to them . 
  http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mel45efdk/mark-zuckerbergs-backyard/ how many syrian refugees has he welcomed ? 
  that 's difficult to forget , especially after the libyan intervention . 
  toppling a cruel but tamed dictator in libya , which predictably turned africa 's richest country into a jihadist mess full of refugees heading for europe , has been the biggest act of lunacy from european powers so far in this century . 
  edit : misspelling . 
  compared to 75 years ago , germany 's approach has shifted from populating the rest of the world with germans , to populating germany with the rest of the world . 
  i hope that germany will find a middle way one day . 
  it was probably easy to take these guys out of afghanistan . 
  taking afghanistan out of them on the other hand ... 
  yeah , good that they are doing something about this degeneracy , instead of focusing on virtuous patriotic acts like political assassinations , embezzlement and massive corruption . 
  no , but to create a situation which will deter more refugees from coming . 
   the calculus behind the decision was clearly stated by austrian interior minister johanna mikl-leitner weeks ago . 
  greece can not and will not hold migrants and refugees . 
  ...  mikl-leitner said that ** one needs images of desperate refugees and migrants stranded on greece 's beaches in order to deter people from coming to europe . 
  ** she says that after a few weeks north africans , afghans , and perhaps even syrians and iraqis will stop coming because they will know that they have no chance of arriving in the north of europe . 
  [ about the national interest ] ( http://nationalinterest.org/about-the-national-interest )  it is about american interests . 
   say what you want about trump but at least he has platform that doesnt benefit only small amount of rich people . 
  but he in turn seem to be very extreme in terms of personality . 
  although his platform might not be , the thought of someone like that in charge of thousands of nuclear weapons is n't exactly calming , to put it that way . 
  germany 1939-45 : let 's populate the rest of the world with germans !, 
  germany today : let 's populate germany with the rest of the world !, 
   so no harry potter fandom in ksa i guess they reject german weapons then . 
  true . 
  i think it would decrease the flow to an extent , so it should be done , but unfortunately greece would still have a problem i think . 
  partially because syria is much closer to europe , making more people willing to try to come , and also because the size of the refugee population has grown so massively recently . 
  as for libya , it 's impossible now because of the unstable situation there . 
  i just hope that we have learned the lesson now that toppling a dictator when the most likely replacement is a jihadist chaos should ** not ** be done again . 
  ideally that should be the solution . 
  if we want to take in , they should be filtered outside the eu and then be brought in , rather than them just storming in illegally . 
  but that very much depends on a cooperative approach from turkey in order to decrease the flow to the greek islands and send back those who come illegally . 
  and that approach does n't seem to be there at all . 
   our islands are n't human storages either . 
  they have people living in them . 
  then the camps , if built , could be fenced off from the local population . 
   it would be like saying `` oh , it 's fine , we do n't ask all of norway to become a refugee camp , just a couple of regions '' . 
  would that be acceptable to you ? 
  of course no , but if the choice was between all of it or just a couple of regions , obviously the latter would be the least bad option . 
  and if news then spread that refugees simply wo n't get out of those regions/islands , the flow would get a lot smaller i guess . 
  isolating the refugees on the islands might therefore be the best option . 
  or maybe avoid shipping all of them to the mainland , and rather ask other countries for help to build camps on the islands ? 
   the wider issue is that refusal of refugees is against international law , but the refugees concerned are already in safety in turkey and other countries before they travel to europe . 
  it should n't be a problem to refuse them then . 
  true , and as a norwegian i wo n't moralize . 
  but in the times we live in , we might not have any choice . 
  i know it sounds harsh . 
  but he should have been open about his plan to travel to austria when he applied . 
  the fact that he concealed it made the immigration officer sceptical , especially since he comes from a very radicalized country from which europe gets many illegal migrants . 
   turkey , lebanon and jordan have been dealing with a refugee problem for decades .
