we are best, 
  the thing is that sweden has a lot of ghettos , so either you feel it or you do n't , here in norway for example the refugees are populated mostly out all over the country leading to few ghettos ( oslo east is the only area with ghettos ) . 
  where as in sweden they let the immigrant chose where they want to live . 
  anyway importing cynical people lowers the overall trust, 
  or everyone is kind , 
  it can be seen as a tax , but not as an income tax, 
   payd with debt . 
  not high it is below replasement levels , but strong economies attracts immigrants, 
  yes, 
  around 25-35 %, 
   the personal income tax rate in norway stands at 38.52 percent . 
  no it is not, 
  username checks out, 
  by this logic germany is should still own a lot of western poland, 
   i think we were one of the driving forces behind the single market and for expansion into eastern europe , and that we reduced the degree of integration in many other areas . 
  thats quite ironic as ee immigration was the main reason for brexit, 
  well the eu be damned, 
  i am all for polish work immigration , but they have to get paid the same as the natives , if not we are the losers, 
   which is why i will vote them you can vote every 4 years so if the one of the small parties change their mind , you can always vote on someone else, 
  no the major parties want to start drill , but the small ones are `` oil blocking '' lofoten, 
  how big is the british state budget for comparison ? 
   populism ? 
  after 2016 people overthinked what populism mean , populism is proposing something just to get votes, 
  i do n't think we have salmonella in finland , sweden and norway, 
   that 's what the drunkards say at least . 
  for myself i am pretty dry, 
  for the southern europeans : if you do something stupid in scandinavia , it is ok as long as you were drunk , ( so stop with the muslim comparison , muslims can ` t drink ), 
  in norway we only have norwegian eggs , beacuse the more norwegian the better , 
  would disagree , the painters just took the colors in the wrong order, 
  yes, 
  atleast one would `` spend 1.77 % less money on health care and have 11 % more babies '', 
   are your wages capped ? 
  no the union negotiate pay and work conditions with employer , and the wage is based based on your education and experience . 
   also , why are big cities so bad ? 
  it has to do with tradition , norwegians love tradision , also we don ` t want the countryside to `` die out '' . 
  so it ` s not about hindering big cities , but rather to conserve the counrtyside . 
  in addition , the farmerorganisationsuntry are really god at lobby work , they are very close with the centerparty ( formerly '' the farmerparty ) , which are at 11 % at the polls and are likely to be a part of the goverment after the election 11 september . 
   the world changed , the policy should follow . 
  the world can change again and then its better safe than sorry . 
  and your comment , `` the policy should follow '' , does only argument against the `` incase war '' argument of the agrucultural policy , not any awnser to get people keeping living in the districts and avoid further centralisation . 
  when the people inside the parties does not even manage to agree on important issues , that is kind of the same though, 
  if we get invaded it is hard to import food , under the war the people living in farms were spoiled compared to city people . 
  and people living in the cities used to send their children to farms, 
  it has to do with keeping people living in the rural areas , and a fierce resistance towards centralisation . 
  for example the main goals of the norwegian agrucultural policy is keeping people living in the rural areas and being on the safe side incase we get invaded . 
  in eu it is the feed the population . 
  fishing keeps people living rural and is those who work as fishermen get very well paid . 
  also , it has to do with the fact that our politicians really love eu while the population dislike eu , so the politicans make norway closer tied to the eu than the population want . 
  it is important to have several thought in the same time . 
  without the refugees the gdp/capita would be higher while the gdp overall would be slightly lower . 
  without the refugees the swedish goverment would stand more freely to invest in school , infrastructure and tax cuts to increase the economy even more , increase public services to give the swedes a better life or decrease the debt til : dr : without refugees the swedes would be even richer, 
  it 's not our fault we 're so great, 
   are they ignorant and close minded too ? 
   irrelevant , they have n't voted to leave the eu . 
  til : you need to leave the eu to be ignorant and close minded, 
  the point is that decifit , used on other stuff than investments , is always bad , it ` s better using the taxpayers money on public services like healthcare and pensions , than intrest, 
  if you have a big decifit you end up like greece, 
  yes, 
  it ` s how efficient people are at working, 
  and people wonder why brexit happened, 
   prices in non-european money pretty sure that pounds are a european currency, 
   also are n't you at least legally a norwegian citizen if you have a norwegian citizenship ? 
  i do not really understand the question , if you are a legal citizen if you have citizenship ? 
   yeah but they are still norwegian citizen right ? 
  http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/fengsel/34-prosent-av-alle-innsatte-er-utlendinger/a/24084135/ , and that is not even counting the forigners with citezenship, 
   how is it giving a right to a costumer decreasing its rights ? 
  because in norway we already have those rights , 2 years on things thatis only expected to last fro 2 years and 5 years for things that are expected to last for atleast 5 years . 
  the shop can give extra long guarantee if they want so it is only a minimum . 
  however in this this bill it is stated that for stuff bought online the warranty is ** maximum ** 2 years , opposed to the minimum 5 years for many objects of today, 
  in norway this will decrease consumer rights , as if you buy something on the internet that in norway have 5 years guarantee ( example : phones , washingmaschines , cars , fridges ) it will due to this bill have 2 years guarantee . 
  if you buy it in the internet , in a regular store the guarantee will be the same . 
  same in norway , you just don ` t have to be baptised , you just need one of your parents to be registred in the church, 
  the headline said european consumption not ** eu ** consumption !, 
   and they cant export enough to lower prices elsewhere due to limited cable capacity ? 
  can , but won ` t. 
  but , seriously norway import electricity from denmark when there is much wind ( cheap ) and export when there is little wind ( expensive ) . 
  it ` s not only the uk , in norway the trade unions are starting to get pissed off on the poles, 
  well perosonally i like the norwegian policy in this matter : if we ca n't build a church in your country you ca n't build a mosque in our country, 
  take up the flag, 
  the ~ ~ mexicans ~ ~ people who voted brexit are ignorant , stupid , xenophobic or close-minded , and some i guess are good people, 
  well , more people is more people who have to share the oil fund and anyway the growth mainly comes from refugees that don ` t have any useful skills and just go around being net tax recievers and eastern europeans/swedes who build houses and serve at resturants , however the last group is declining, 
  sweden does that too, 
  my name is captain obvious !, 
  for those who don ` t understand norwegians , its asterix and obelix just that the eu are the romans and the norwegians are the gallics, 
  which one ? 
  well atleast in norway the bucher is required to give the animal anesthesia, 
  yeah , but that is not `` real '' halal , that is only some guy giving a chicken a prayer , i think the islamsk r\u00e5d mainly does it for the money . 
  the thing when they let the animal bleed to death, 
   halal preparation is typically considered unethical in europe - is it therefore demeaning to muslims that we should deny them the practice ? 
  well atleast in norway halal is illegal, 
  also , when the currency get weaker the value of the oil fund increase in kr, 
  in general its laws that is for he whole eu/eea and since the eu/eea is diverse something that is smart in portugal is plain unneccesary in norway . 
  one example is that due to eu regulation if a bank goes bankrupt the state can only give the costumers up to 100k euro opposed to the 2 million kroner it used to be, 
  why do norway have responsibility for the poor countries in europe , we already give a lot in foreign aid, 
  we did not join the kalmar union voluntarily , it was because our kings kept dying and suddenly the heir was the queen of denmark, 
  fishing have really high profit , and even in norway not everyone have the ability to be math geniuses, 
  if you don ` t believe fishing is a major reason look at our new money http://e24.vgc.no/drpublish/images/article/2014/10/07/23311348/1/default/200_the_metric_system.png, 
  the eu is not seen as arrogant in norway without reason, 
  * `` the norwegians , for example , do kill a high percentage of their whales instantaneously . 
  '' * anyway , what is wrong with giving whale meat to fur farms or exporting it ?
