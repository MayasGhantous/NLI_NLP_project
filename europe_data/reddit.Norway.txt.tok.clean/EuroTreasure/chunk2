  but why put the blame on anything other than the people who are deranged extremists . 
  that is the main issue here . 
  or is this because of french colonial policies in syria ? 
  somebody have to buy it , so if the eu/nato can not find a solution , i can not blame france for keeping their deal . 
  what did this treaty say were to happen when security was restored ? 
  in this context , i presume the defeat of the junta . 
  wrong fallacy fallacy, 
  if they just see a dot , do n't fire at it at all . 
  that should be the operating procedure . 
  it is a dangerous game putin has been playing , letting these useful idiots run around causing instability to benefit russia . 
  hopefully a wakeup call for russia . 
  and hopefully a wakeup call for the west that it should not trust that everythinh is under control from kiev . 
  i do n't think chaplin had the kind of politician like merkel or cameron in mind when he uttered these worlds . 
  if anything , is not the european project built on these principles ? 
  if i was rich , i would pay ufc fighters to put on a kippah and take a stroll in these neighbourhoods as bait and film it . 
  also , an great idea for a youtube channel , could probably pay for itself in ad-revenue . 
  kickstarter anyone ? 
  adjusted for population , norway would deport 1126 per day if it had 313 million people . 
  i am guessing you are fishing for the odd and the negative , so i will state a few of those . 
  # ** the search for higher relevance in global space ** we norwegians have cognitive dissonance because of the fact that we are rich on one hand , and globally insignificant on the other hand . 
  because of this , we get obsessed by hearing what other people/foreigners think of us . 
  if the new york times writes a positive article about oslo as a travel destination , this is national news in the norwegian tabloids . 
  some people have learned to take advantage of this . 
  they are called `` norgesvenner '' or ( norway-friends ) . 
  basically they are artists and celebrities that have a dying/down-spiraling career , who decide that they should develop a special relationship with norway . 
  it becomes a symbiotic relationship , where we norwegians pretend that this person is more of a celebrity that they are , and they pretend that norway is a bigger market than we are . 
  and so we lull each other in this illusion . 
  # ** norwegian food is the only safe source of food ** all foods that are produced and packaged outside of norway , are ticking bombs of salmonella , hormones and pesticides . 
  # ** cars as the primary way to display status ** despite the fact , or maybe because of the fact , that norway has insane import fees on cars , cars remain the primary way to display status in norway . 
  if you buy a car for 80 000 euros , then surely you are a successful and happy family , and who cares if you have to eat porridge everyday until 2035 . 
  # ** i pay out of my ass in taxes , so [ insert any collective problem ] is not my problem ** why should i give to charity ? 
  i pay taxes , the state should fix that . 
  oh , i 'll just throw this garbage on the street , i pay taxes , the state should fix that . 
  if i look directly at the sun to long , it hurts my eyes , i pay taxes , the state should fix that . 
  # ** the art of avoiding someone you know and have not seen for a long time ** an old class mate ? 
  your third cousin ? 
  they are all out there in the wild , as ticking time bombs which can spring up on you at any time . 
  the number 1 fear of any norwegian is to meet the people who intersecpt in the venn-diagram between `` people you would have to have a conversation with if you met them '' and `` people you dont want to have a conversion with or you know them to little to have a constructive conversation with them '' . 
  always be scouting 100 meters in front of you . 
  this will give you time to re-route or jump into the bushes . 
  # ** you have started what ??? 
  ** you have started your own shop selling cat toys ? 
  oh , that is not going to work , why would you do that ? 
  it 's not going to work !, 
  * one year passes * . 
  so that cat shop is going good huh ? 
  anyone could do that you know . 
  # ** the fear of change ** if something changes my life or work situation by a minuscule amount , this must be seen as an attack on my person/profession , and a part of grander plan of turning norway into america , and must be fought off with any means available to the norwegian ( which is mainly complaining and shaming ), 
  central europe asserting itself more and more every day . 
  kindergarden children . . that is sad . 
  me too putin , just i want my vision , not yours . 
  true , egalitarianism is good , but not if everybody is equally poor . 
  if only the focus of people were to rise the conditions of the poorest 10 % , instead of lowering it for the richest 10 % . 
  makes you wonder if people are driven by the desire to help the poor , or just ` get ' the rich . 
  i am talking about the forces that feed the narrative , so yes . 
  just look at thatcher or any other woman who has taken the highest office . 
  she had to fight twice for her opinion , first for the political validity of them , and then the fact that she is a woman stating them . 
  and when the tabloids see something that can both plug into germanophobia and misogyny , this is tabloid gold . 
  no , its the underlying generator . 
  the perpetual germanophobia that stirs under the anglo-saxon surface . 
  at the cross section where germanophobia and misogyny meet . 
  i honestly think that this article has no broad interest on / r/europe . 
  it 's just domestic quarrelling and puditry from the uk . 
  prague ? 
  one hell of a football team, 
  wars are better fought in court rooms with treaties and laws as fodder than in fields . 
  just this fact shows how far we have come as a continent . 
  so now we are holding him doing his job against him ? 
  as the finance/prime minister of luxemburg , it is not his job to protect other european countries from leaking money into luxemburg . 
  who is an credible existential threat to the us at all ? 
  and vice versa . 
  european obligation to defend the us . 
  more europeans have died in wars invoked by the us with basis in article 5 of the nato charter , than vice versa . 
  the problem is that you come to the table notion that the us does something out of their kindness in their hearts , and the rest of the world owes something for it . 
  and it produces such infantile reactions that you display here . 
  `` if you do n't like us , we wo n't help you '' . 
  it 's freedom fries all over again . 
  at the highest level , geopolitics is nothing but realpolitik , alliances of mutual benefiting . 
  the # 1 thing that poland can do to ensure its own security and integrity , is to integrate its economy with the german one . 
  then it has as little to fear from germany , as france has . 
  so you are the guy behind those policies . 
  you do n't trust recovering alcoholics in finland do you ? 
  only alcoholics . 
  my point just flew straight over your head did it not . 
  and i am disappointed at us mild reaction to shit going down in saudi arabia . 
  politics make strange bed-fellows . 
  us embassy in oslo http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_bnop43mv_py/s9xv8mrhozi/aaaaaaaarys/0acezefwphy/s1600/usa.jpg, 
  smoking . 
  soon , we will be emigrating there for jobs . 
  throw in a alp-hat and you could have a game changer . 
  joke aside . 
  if german society makes you have to be twice as good as the others , take that as a gift and opportunity to become twice as good . 
  `` fire feeds on obstacles . '' marcus aurelius, 
  have you ever tried wearing lederhosen on a daily basis ? 
  if not , how can you truly say that you tried fitting in ? 
  federal eu , united states of europe , call it what you want , is not an idea you can be for or against . 
  it 's really not that simple . 
  it is a configuration of europe which europe itself , willing or not , is heading towards because it is the configuration which is most optimal . 
  it is like kevin kellys notion of the technium . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/what_technology_wants we do n't decide that europe is a common project .
