if i 'm understanding it correctly , that 's the price leif h\u00f6egh & co paid hyundai heavy industries for the construction of the ship . 
  the 1.8 billion ltl is what klaipeda oil will pay over ten years to lease the ship . 
  [ from wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fsru_independence ) :  fsru independence , delivered in march 2014 is an lng carrier designed as a floating lng storage and regasification unit to be used as an lng import terminal in lithuania . 
  the vessel can store 170 000 m \u00b3 natural gas and can supply all of lithuania 's need for natural gas . 
  the vessel will start to operate in the autumn of 2014 and will then make lithuania independent of natural gas from russia . 
  lithuanian wikipedia has a more meaty article , but lithuanian is [ not google translate 's strongest language ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=no&amp;sl=lt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2flt.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fsgd_laivas-saugykla_independence ) . 
  this all sounds very good . 
  1.8 billion ltl is [ a significant chunk of money ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=1800000000+ltl+in+eur ) , but probably worth it for an alternative to russian gas . 
  but did erasmus increase your likeliness to date other nationalities , or is the kind of person that likes to date other nationalities simply more likely to want to study abroad ? 
  personally i 'm guessing it 's a little of both . 
  and i did n't actually read the pdf , that thing is * huge * . 
  the first samsung galaxy was released in 2009 . 
  if nokia were to be what galaxy is for android , they would have had to either make an android phone as good as or better than the galaxy * before * the galaxy , or a significantly better android phone shortly after . 
  i think it 's unlikely , but it might have been possible , had they not been busy at the time developing their own modern touch phone operating system , meego . 
  personally i think the scrapping of meego is the biggest tragedy in this whole story . 
  some of norway 's biggest companies are heavily invested in russia , and will likely lose a lot of money with tougher sanctions . 
  also , norway imposing sanctions on russia will likely have very little effect on international oil prices . 
  overall i 'm pretty sure joining these sanctions will cost us a lot more than it will earn us . 
  so far it 's just words . 
   the new sanctions will require approval from the parliament in oslo . 
  it could be an interesting vote . 
  i 'm not even sure if brende has the backing of his own party on this issue . 
  that is a good point , and probably why they stick with a selection of default subreddits . 
  i may not agree with their decision , but i can certainly understand it . 
  haha , yes , they would probably want to use a sfw filter . 
  [ / r/all ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/all/ ), 
  what 's your rss reader of choice ? 
  i 've been looking for one that presents the feeds in a pleasing way . 
  [ feedly ] ( http://feedly.com ) looks nice , but the list of permissions they want is frightening . 
  oooh , i 've been wanting something like this . 
  i hope other new sources do the same . 
  i remember the news reports back then . 
  poland 's president and much of his administration dead in a plane crash in russia . 
  the president 's identical twin brother said he 'd run for president . 
  it all sounded like the plot of a james bond movie , and i 'm not at all surprised that many doubt the official report . 
  when i read the article i do n't really get the feeling that the daily beast is trying to push an agenda , and it seems pretty clear that the writer does n't believe in the conspiracy theory about the crash . 
  they are really just recycling an old case on a slow news day , i think . 
  this seems like a good place to ask something i 've been wondering about . 
  if i post a non-english submission in / r/worldsatire ( or any other subreddit for that matter ) , for example an article from the norwegian `` the onion '' [ 5080 ] ( http://www.5080.no/ ) , will the submission be visible for everyone , or only for those who have ticked off norwegian as a [ content language ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cyaxz14.png ) ? 
  my icelandic is n't very good , so i do n't understand much of that report . 
  well , maybe if i really tried , but i 'm lazy . 
  are you sure you 're reading the numbers correctly , though ? 
   there are 12,7 abortions for every 1000 pregnancies in iceland . 
  this works out to 1.27 % , which would make you as blue as poland . 
  did you mean 12.7 abortions per 1000 women per year ? 
  i 'm glad to see that site growing and getting more meat on it . 
  :-) however , this is / r/europe , privacy concerns may not even be the reason behind this submission , maybe just curiousity . 
  personally i 'd love to see the european tech industry benefit from the privacy scandals in the us . 
  it 's european , that 's all / u/i282s asked for . 
  as for prism , ubuntu was not on the leaked list of companies participating in the program . 
  if another list is leaked , with ubuntu in it , then i 'll look for a replacement . 
  i 'm currently using [ ubuntu one ] ( https://one.ubuntu.com/ ) , which i guess is british . 
  [ ultra sheriff - firestorm ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gugqs9a_ol4 ),

  [ direct link ] ( http://youtu.be/zt2z0nrsq8o?t=2m7s ) . 
  you know what ? 
  i 'd vote for that . 
  he might be the first contestant to ever get more than a hundred percent of the vote . 
  personally i 'd love to see a million angry europeans with torches and pitchforks surrounding brandenburger tor . 
  we should all try to apply pressure wherever we can . 
  i sent an email earlier today to the relevant committees of parliament demanding they take action . 
  no reply yet . 
  i guess most of them wo n't even check their in-box until monday . 
  condoms does seem a bit random though . 
  is it to encourage the parents to wait a while before making more babies ? 
  i suppose it would be exhausting to take care of a toddler while pregnant . 
  and the vast majority of web browsing [ is still on desktops ] ( http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_vs_desktop-eu-monthly-200812-201302 ) . 
  ( i guess laptops are included in the desktop category , as they probably ca n't tell them apart . ), 
  in any case the [ most recent numbers from statcounter ] ( http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-by-monthly-200807-201302 ) show a green belarus . 
  thorgal is amazing , but i 'm not sure i would compare it to tintin . 
  there 's a fairly new norwegian comic named [ kr\u00fcger & krogh ] ( https://www.facebook.com/pages/kr%c3%bcger-krogh/272189262827718 ) , which is heavily inspired by the classic franco-belgian comics . 
  the first album was ( in my opinion ) very solid , but i 'm not sure if it 's been translated to other languages yet . 
  second album is in the works . 
  as the only european browser ( of the big five at least ) it should be the most popular in all of europe .

  tablets ( thankfully ) still have a long way to go to compete with proper computers in popularity . 
  is n't the green party basically the swedish party ? 
  consider voting jill stein tomorrow . 
  actually a simple solution would be to have a third setting where friends are allowed to invite friends , but no friends of friends ' friends , etc. 
  you suggestion might result in thousands of requests that the arranger has to answer , in events like this . 
  so this happens sometimes . 
  some girl sets up a facebook event for her birthday , and for whatever reason does n't make it a private event ( often i suspect they do n't even know there is such a thing as a private event ) . 
  usually it turns out ok , but every once in a while it goes viral ( probably a thousand times more likely to happen if the girl is hot ) . 
  does part of the blame lay at facebook ? 
  you 'd think after the 5th time an event like this made the news they 'd sit down around the table discussing if their event planner might need some slight changes . 
  it could n't be that hard to , for example , make an event automatically be changed from public to private if it has the word `` birthday '' in it , the person hosting it is under 18 , and the number of attenders pass 200 ? 
  much better . 
  :-)  you are ** a social democratic patriot ** . 
  2 percent of the test participators are in the same category and 81 percent are more extremist than you . 
  not quite what i expected , but i only did the short test , and there were some really tough choices . 
  venstre is probably the closest ? 
   probably , the lack of a neutral option is twisting the results . 
  also the many loaded questions . 
  i can think of four reasons . 
  more free publicity this way . 
  this way he does n't have to pay for it . 
  because he can . 
  lots of people would love to play robin hood if they could get away with it without consequences . 
  maybe he wants to bring attention to the ridiculous fact that politicians are apparently above the law . 
  also , this is probably a lot easier than stealing from the government budget .
