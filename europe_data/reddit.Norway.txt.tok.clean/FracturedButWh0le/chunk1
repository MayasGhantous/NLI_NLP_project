it 's called self reproduction of social systems or autopoiesis . 
  in pretty much every country on earth ? 
  what 's the mechanisms ? 
  what do you base all these things on ? 
  not really . 
  the right wing in every country ( that i 've heard of ) complains about the media being left-wing . 
  yes . 
  you said he attacked a group that let them in , but they were kids and teenagers . 
  some , probably , but it 's not a wide-spread problem that i 'm aware of . 
  most of the people he killed were kids and teenagers . 
  they let them `` go inside '' ? 
  how is that logical ? 
   how would you feel if there was an explosion every couple of weeks ? 
  it 's spring and soon summer . 
  it 's gon na happen . 
  the police here have absolutely ** crushed ** the islamist community . 
  pretty much every prominent islamist is either a ) in jail , b ) in syria or c ) dead . 
  just a few days ago , another prominent isis-sympatiheiser was sentenced to nine years in prison for aiding support to the group . 
  there 's plenty of other groups of immigrants that have these same feelings of alienation , yet they do not lash out by running over people or try to blow people up . 
   when it comes to the professional , organized groups they usually are n't immigrants , but just come for several weeks and then return to their homecountry . 
  [ say what ? 
   they do n't want islam to be compatible with western civilisation , they do n't want you to believe that islam can be compatible with western civilisation . 
  do you believe wives should obey their husband ? 
  1.39 billion muslims does . 
  do you believe sharia should be the law that govern the land ? 
  1.1 billion muslims does . 
  do you believe in death for adultery ? 
  748 million muslims does . 
  do you believe in death for apostasy ? 
  584 million muslims does . 
   middle of desert you mean the birthplace of said religion ? 
  it may , but they 're a ** long ** way from achieving it . 
  where would such a reformation even start these days ? 
  in what muslim majority country ? 
  europeans spent centuries fighting over another archaic religion from the me -- why would we want to start this process all over again with a different religion ? 
   i do n't see how the extremists from the host population getting violent against migrants is an argument for immigration . 
  breivik did n't attack immigrants , he attacked the government and the labor party . 
  and why would we let the threat , or the use , of violence shape our policies ? 
  to be fair , witnesses heard people screaming `` this is for afghanistan '' after the bomb went off . 
  it 's an acquired taste . 
  just like beer , or wine . 
   progressives like merkel merkel is the leader of the christian democratic union of germany , a center-right party ... .

  why did you put it in quotation marks ? 
  we can order them for free online , and they 'll get sent in an unmarked , anonymous envelope to your address . 
  how do you feel about the armenian genocide ?

  thanks . 
  sorry dude , but the french have a well deserved reputation of being rude and unwelcoming . 
  do n't worry . 
  you can into nordic . 
   why do these northern countries focus so much into english ? 
  it 's a mixture of a lot of things . 
  learning english from an early age , having undubbed tv-shows / movies ( this is seriously underrated ) and speaking a language only a few million people understand . 
  we have to know different languages in order to communicate . 
  it 's not that cold here anymore either . 
  no , i 'm discrediting your source by pointing out they peddle conspiracy theories like : - 9/11 was an inside job - vaccines causes autism - holocaust denial - homeopathy works - vaccines are being administered to sterilize people - chemtrails - global warming is a hoax - north korea is a `` land of human achievement , love and joy '' - charlie hebdo was a false flag the list goes on , and on , and on . 
  also , i do n't care if a source is biased , i only care if it 's ** objective ** . 
  any source that claims to have no bias is lying . 
  i just replied in the same tone . 
  i see now that he has since edited his comment , though , wich makes it seem like i wrote it unprovoked . 
  i remember during the cartoon-crisis , were they burned our flag instead of the danish one . 
  good times . 
  these people are not good with flags . 
   why do you trust the biased media and liberal sources so hard ? 
  here 's some stories published by globalresearch.ca ( the source you gave me when i asked for a credible one to support your assertion ) http://www.globalresearch.ca/australia-silences-criticism-of-vaccines-benefits-of-homeopathy/5422041 http://www.globalresearch.ca/depopulation-vaccine-in-kenya-and-beyond/5413445 http://www.globalresearch.ca/uncovering-the-cover-up-scientific-analysis-of-the-vaccine-autism-connection-deeply-flawed-vaccine-policies/5491987 http://www.globalresearch.ca/is-the-un-using-vaccines-to-secretly-sterilize-women-all-over-the-globe/5413599 http://www.globalresearch.ca/911-truth-in-2014-is-a-breakthrough-possible/5374524 http://www.globalresearch.ca/anti-semitism-the-ultimate-zionist-weapon/5394499 http://www.globalresearch.ca/chemtrails-the-consequences-of-toxic-metals-and-chemical-aerosols-on-human-health/19047 http://www.globalresearch.ca/global-warming-media-propaganda/5364444 http://www.globalresearch.ca/north-korea-a-land-of-human-achievement-love-and-joy/5344960 http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-true-story-of-the-bilderberg-group-and-what-they-may-be-planning-now/13808 http://www.globalresearch.ca/paris-killings-media-lies-unanswered-questions-was-it-a-false-flag/5424029 yeah , i 'll take my `` biased liberal media '' any day . 
  your assertion still does n't prove the us tried to destabilize syria in order to prevent russia from getting a gas monopoly . 
  you 're just spewing unsubstantiated nonsense that crumbles when looked upon more closely . 
  the fact you 're basically just telling me to take your word for it , does n't help your case either . 
  edit :  but read here , http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-secret-stupid-saudi-us-deal-on-syria/5410130 sorry , i said credible sources . 
  not someone peddling conspiracy theories . 
  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/globalresearch https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michel_chossudovsky, 
   you mean biased liberal-media . 
  i 'll take their word over random people that posts in t_d any day of the week . 
   qatar have talked about expanding the pipeline since 2005 and experts have been talking about energy `` crossroads '' in syria way before that . 
  none of that proves the us tried to destabilize syria in order to prevent russia from getting a gas monopoly . 
   it is true that qatar had proposed a pipeline to carry its natural gas to turkey . 
  but nearly everything else about the story turns out , upon investigation , to be untrue . 
  there is no contemporaneous report of any such rejection by the syrian government . 
  it was only four years later , in august 2013 that an agence france-presse article recounting what happened in a meeting between president vladimir putin and saudi intelligence chief prince bandar bin sultan , claimed in passing , `` in 2009 , assad refused to sign an agreement with qatar for an overland pipeline running from the gulf to europe via syria to protect the interests of its russian ally , which is europe 's top supplier of natural gas . '', 
  no source is given for the statement , but the main source for other information in the article was `` a european diplomat who shuttles between beirut and damascus . '', 
   that claim has no credibility for a very simple reason : there was no qatari proposal for syria to reject in 2009 . 
  it was not until october 2009 that qatar and turkey even agreed to form a working group to develop such a gas pipeline project . 
   even more important , the immediate problem for qatar 's proposal was not syria but saudi arabia , whose territory the qatari gas would have to cross to get to syria . 
  in january 2010 , the national , a daily uae [ united arab emirates ] newspaper reported that the main obstacle to the idea of a pipeline to carry qatari natural gas to turkey and then to europe `` was likely to be saudi arabia , which has a track record of obstructing regional pipeline development '' and still had very bad relations with qatar . 
  and middle east geopolitical analyst felix imonti reported at oilprice.com in 2012 that qatar had been forced to abandon the pipeline idea in 2010 because saudi arabia had not agreed to have it built across its territory . 
   so where did the idea that the obama administration responded to assad 's alleged rejection by shifting to covert regime change policy come from ? 
  kennedy 's article asserts , `` in 2009 , according to wikileaks , soon after bashar assad rejected the qatar pipeline , the cia began funding opposition groups in syria . '', 
   but the article links to a washington post news report on the wikileaks cables on syria that does n't support that charge at all . 
  according to the post report , the cables show that a london-based satellite channel called barada tv , supported by the state department , `` began broadcasting in april 2009 . '', 
  but they also show , according to the post report , that the state department had `` funneled as much as $ 6 million to the group since 2006 to operate the satellite channel and finance other activities insidesyria . '', 
  your assertions does n't seem to hold up according to several investigative reporters that has written books on this issue . 
  i knew you would be a regular t_d poster before i checked your history . 
  i knew it . 
   right ? 
  this is coming from western europe , which largely allies with saudi arabia . 
  op 's post reads like a juvenile proposal from some suburban white kid . 
  i 'm pretty sure these people wants to cut ties with ksa also .
