  no , it did n't . 
   [ two senior officials with direct access to the information say new intelligence shows that putin personally directed how hacked material from democrats was leaked and otherwise used . 
  the intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for u.s. allies , the officials said . 
  ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-officials-putin-personally-involved-u-s-election-hack-n696146 ) independent security firms , like threatconnect , crowdstrike , mandiant and fidelis , also issued a comprehensive report on the hackings done by russian hacking groups known as fancy bear and cozy bear - wich we know are connected with the russian government . 
    also this report came out with out any intelligence agency being able to search the hacked systems because the dnc denied access . 
  the forensic review was done by a private company , and later shared with the investigators [ ( wich had no impact on the conclusion , only the time it took for them to form a conclusion ) ] ( http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/313555-comey-fbi-did-request-access-to-hacked-dnc-servers ), 
  sure we do . 
  russia is a eurasian country . 
   he has n't got a single worked out plan and literally said something along the lines of `` we do n't really have a plan , but just vote for us and we will take care of everything '' . 
  so he 's like every right-wing populist in the world ? 
  how about every intelligence agency ? 
  best part about being norwegian , is being able to read/understand other scandinavian languages as well . 
  which means i 'm able to spot the usual bs your side likes to throw our way , mostly towards sweden . 
  i checked your breitbart article , and funny enough , the original source has no mention of anything mentioned in the article . 
  imagine my surprise . 
  yeah , we kinda take abusing children seriously over here . 
  if you want to abuse your children , you better move to another country . 
  i worry more about eastern-europeans roaming through our country-side , stealing everything they can . 
  that seems like more of problem . 
  well , we disagree there . 
  i think being part of a group and contributing to the worst atrocities since ww2 and several dozens war crimes should be punished severely . 
  she not only killed people , she was part of a group that waged war against her country of birth . 
  i have zero sympathy towards these people , no matter their age . 
  they knew it was wrong when they left , hence why they hid their plans from their parents and friends . 
  she should face the harshest punishment available , and if that is death -- so be it . 
  again , why should she stand trial in germany , when her crimes happened in iraq ? 
  i 'm not . 
  i 'm not opposed to the death penalty because of reasons of morality , but because of a flawed judicial system , but here there 's no doubt . 
  she willingly and knowingly went across the globe in order to murder and maim people and she should be punished accordingly . 
   and as her being a german - i 'd say she deserves prison and rehabilitation in germany . 
  why ? 
  why should she not be tried and convicted where her crimes happened ? 
  she committed crimes against the people of iraq , not germany . 
   women on death row are held at the shaaba khamsa death row facility at camp justice , kadhimiyya , baghdad . 
  ** girls under 18 who are handed death sentences are held at karrada juvenile detention facility until they turn 18 ; at that stage they are transferred to the adult women 's death row . 
  ** as of 2014 the adult women 's death row had 36 women as well as children even though the facility was only intended to hold 25 women . 
  [ 10 ] lets hope she gets her just punishment . 
  everyone does . 
   there 's a reason why law treats accountability of minors differently . 
  in iraq , where she committed the crime ? 
  she should be tried and punished where the crime happened . 
  germany seem to agree with me , hence why they 're not asking for extradition . 
  no , my point was that people - even at 16 - know that killing is wrong . 
  and my point was n't that we should kill everyone that does things i would n't do at 16 , but you had no problem pretending that was what i said . 
  victimless crime vs murder . 
  adventure is a nice way of saying killing , and facilitating the murder of others . 
  she should be tried and sentenced where she committed the crime . 
   she did , but she 's also not an adult . 
  so fucking what ? 
  i knew not to kill people at 16 and i 'm sure other people did as well . 
  it 's not like a 16 year old is n't capable of discerning what 's right and wrong . 
  you can ask a five year old , and he 'll tell you killing is wrong as well . 
  the consensus does not seem to indicate that ... 
  most want her to rot in iraq . 
  i knew not to kill people at 16 . 
  russian meddling in the election = / = trump is putin 's bottom bitch . 
   obama refused to sell missiles to poland because it would piss off russia that was not the reason . 
   frankly , the ` trump is putin 's puppet ! 1 ' conspiracy theory looks more idiotic by the day . 
  in what world do you live in ? 
  we 're getting daily reports of key players in his administration having contacts and meetings with the russians , after previously denying it , and calling it `` fake news '' . 
  even putin himself stated :  ( artists ) may act on behalf of their country , they wake up in good mood and paint things . 
  same with hackers , they woke up today , read something about the state-to-state relations . '', 
   `` if they are patriotic , they contribute in a way they think is right , to fight against those who say bad things about russia , '', 
  hahahahaha . 
  giant picture of the leader . 
  that shit is scary . 
  banana-republic scary . 
  you do n't seem to get the specific time the 2 % figure was agreed upon was ** 2024 ** . 
   i would have no problem front much more of the bill if our partners were able to meet their obligations . 
  i 'll look forward to trump taking a few million syrian/iraqi/afghani refugees in the coming years . 
  not like he campaigned and won on doing the exact opposite . 
  imo we should n't spend a euro more on any obligation we have unless the us take a proportional amount of refugees ( which would mean millions ) . 
  you ca n't bomb mena from german airbases and expect us to take all the refugees fleeing because of it any longer . 
   i would like to see the us spend no more than 2 % of our gdp on nato . 
  who told you you spend 2 % of your gdp on nato ? 
  that 's hilarious . 
  2 % of the us ' gdp is $ 284 billion , while natos entire military budget is ~ $ 1.38 billion . 
   right , it 's ` have my back ' at all cost , even when your friend is living in your house and fails to increase his contribution to its maintenance like he said he would . 
  that 's a poor analogy . 
  it was agreed upon in 2014 , that the countries who have n't met their 2 % of gdp on defense yet , should do so by 2024 . 
  ** not ** 2017 . 
  we should make a deal . 
  we promise to get to our 2 % gdp on defense before the agreed upon year ( 2024 ) and you take a proportionate amount of refugees . 
  remember , germany took over one million refugees during the crisis in 2015 , and have roughly 1/4 of the population of the us . 
  how would you feel about taking in four million refugees in one year ? 
  i 'm sure you would n't mind the cost as long as we meet our 2 % of gdp on defense , right ? 
   there is not much of a deterrence if the whole world knows there is no willingness to fight . 
  yeah . 
  that 's why we constantly see other nations testing the alliance ... . 
  what post did i remove ? 
  it 's not a diversion . 
  i 'm a fan of listening to the people who commit these acts , and most of them justify it by pointing to our foreign policy -- almost exclusively . 
  do n't want refugees fleeing and flooding into europe ? 
  then do n't ravage their home countries until they 're uninhabitable . 
  it 's pretty simple , really . 
  they also have a pacifist foreign policy . 
  they do n't get involved in wars in mena . 
  the places where most of these attacks happen ; the us , france , germany and uk are all heavily involved . 
  how about we stop getting involved in these places ? 
  did you seriously not read the whole thing ?
