the bulgarian just turned chinese . 
  which had only about twice as many members ( 559 ) in 2009 and are viewed as mostly a joke . 
  i do n't understand why you think they have an effect on norwegian politics , at least not any time recently . 
  the problem is that many prostitutes are n't prostitutes by their own will . 
  prosecuting them just makes it worse . 
  i 'm norwegian and have never even heard of them . 
  edit : according to [ this ] ( http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/bld/dok/nouer/2011/nou-2011-18/9/2/2.html?id=663137 ) they had 266 members in 2009 ... 
  he 's essentially wearing the indian equivalent of blackface . 
  op said horrible , not amazing . 
  i 'm sure many of the remaining 14 % are old people . 
  that 's my experience in norway at least . 
   the common name `` platypus '' is the latinisation of the greek word \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 ( platupous ) , `` flat-footed '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/platypus#taxonomy_and_etymology, 
  someone has to counterbalance the amount of unnecessary vowels in french . 
  til platypuses are venomous . 
  but http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/platypus_venom says that it 's not lethal to humans ? 
  i think nasjonal samling , but it usually has other colors ( do a google image search ) . 
  edit : it is a version of hirden 's ( their military organization ) flag ` solkors med sverd ' ( sun cross with swords ) . 
  for norway : fjord , obviously . 
  not sure what you mean by `` stand alone '' , but we have http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/kongsberg_defence_%26_aerospace, 
  what 's wrong with tintin ? 
  i recently learned that freestyler was never very popular in the us . 
  it was huge here in norway ( and i believe most of europe ) . 
  we have hyggelig in norwegian as well , but it does n't mean the same thing here . 
  it says ages 18-24 . 
   it 's pretty much exclusively used in that sense http://www.nob-ordbok.uio.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?opp=klein&amp;begge=+ i think it very much depends on the location and age group . 
   which word do you use instead ? 
  i do n't really have an alternative ( which is why this comment thread exists ) . 
  only 60 % of people from the uk could identify germany on a map ? 
  there has to be someone jokingly answering wrong here . 
  you are right , it seems to be somewhat narrower . 
  in speech i think they are used in the same way , but on a sign for example `` vennligst '' would be used . 
  as far as i know it 's not strictly speaking the dictionary definition of the word , although it 's used in that sense , especially by young people . 
  i would never use the word myself . 
  in norwegian we use `` v\u00e6r s\u00e5 snill '' ( `` be so kind '' ) for `` please '' . 
  you have nothing similar in icelandic ? 
  edit : i guess the word you mentioned is similar . 
  in norwegian it is very commonly used , though . 
  '' sweden was once wealthy , beautiful , and modern . 
  but all that has changed . 
  it has become as totalitarian as saudi arabia or iran . 
  their immigration policies have overwhelmed the culture and the treasury of the swedes . 
  one u.n. report says that sweden will soon be a third-world nation . '', 
  why does this garbage get upvoted ? 
  edit : man , those comments . 
  this is breivik level stuff . 
  winternet, 
  not sure if cat or the chinese chairman . 
  since norway is not on the map : we use ` kr\u00f8llalfa ' ( ` curly alpha ' ) or just the english ` at ' . 
  there is no way anyone would be allowed to live like this in a scandinavian country . 
  if the level of german proficiency in norway is any indication of the level in sweden , then i seriously doubt that 20 % can speak it ( even at a basic level ) . 
  i had german in school , and i remember very little of it . 
  the main problem , i think , is that one very rarely is exposed to it . 
  i 'm a horrible norwegian . 
  i hate lutefisk . 
  are you sure the number is correct ? 
  i 'm norwegian , and even i think that number is high . 
  i would 've guessed somewhere around half that . 
  the word mammal also comes from the latin word for breast, 
  i think you mean top post this month , not all time . 
  the weapon was a .22 , so that might be why it was stopped by the vest ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they are synonymous . 
  then please explain the peace prize to obama in 2009 . 
  should we give a peace prize to kim jong-un as well , in the hope that he helps usher along reunification ? 
  no one takes it seriously any more . 
  in two successive years even . 
  edit : and one of them was for '' [ for his work as ] the first secretary of the norwegian nobel committee '' . 
  wow ... 
  it depends on the word really . 
  other words are still close to their old norse roots . 
  respekt for grandiosa . 
  it comes from old norse `` lauga '' ( probably a loan word to finnish ) . 
  i do n't think most scandinavians could tell you that it meant bath day either . 
  in norway ( and i assume the rest of scandinavia ) it 's very encouraged . 
  the vast majority stop living with their parents as soon as they 're done with high school . 
  edit : [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1vz6wr/share_of_young_people_in_the_eu_aged_2534_who_are/ ) map is for 25-34 . 
  i also found [ this ] ( http://www.nrk.no/okonomi/flere-unge-over-18-ar-bor-hjemme-1.7797252 ) news article ( in norwegian ) which suggests that the number for 18-29 was 13 % in 2011 . 
  i 'm not a seismologist , but my impression is that it 's not actually in use . 
  it 's just that the press incorrectly refers to the numbers as being on the richter scale . 
  small correction : the richter scale has n't been in use for 40 years . 
  the one you are looking for is https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/moment_magnitude_scale, 
  we have ** a lot ** more dialects in norway than those shown on this map . 
  i 'm also not a fan of 30 degrees , but i 'd like more than 15 degrees and rain . 
  the weather in trondheim has been pretty lackluster so far . 
  i guess we 're getting punished for last year 's summer . 
  there are only a couple of them that are from 2006 . 
  most seem to be from the last two or three years . 
  i may be confusing airports now , but in [ atlanta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hartsfield%e2%80%93jackson_atlanta_international_airport ) there was a faster line for those in the visa waiver program . 
  i could n't see anything like that from the google translation at least . 
  where does it say that this is n't paid for by the us ? 
  but they would have to do those security checks when they arrived in the us anyway . 
  this just changes where they actually take place ? 
  why were they not positive ? 
  i do n't speak dutch . 
  personally i would be very happy about doing the security stuff before leaving norway . 
  i would send something completely unimportant to someone completely unimportant , as i would be too afraid to fuck up history . 
  wait , this actually happened ? 
  i do n't watch eurovision . 
  it even has number plates !, 
  i would n't say never , but certainly not anytime soon . 
  the numbers would be significantly lower today .
