  edit : the latest number i could find is from august 2014 , with 17.8 % yes . 
  everything east of norway is clearly eastern europe . 
  using circles is a terrible idea . 
  our brain is not very good at comparing areas . 
   whether we like it or not , armed forces are an essential part of any sovereign state and it generally involves lots of danger and a fucked up family life for those involved . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with having a day a year to honour them . 
  i understand that armed forces are necessary , and i have no problem with honoring those who put their life on the line for their country . 
  it 's just the military parades ( with weapons , tanks and airplanes etc ) that are off-putting to me . 
   the fact you personally associate parades with autocratic governments is completly subjective . 
  i agree that it 's subjective , so perhaps my phrasing was unfortunate . 
  i 'm not saying it was the most violent place in wwii , just that it was n't peaceful . 
  that 's not really the same thing . 
  edit : to be clear , i 'm talking about showing off military hardware and so on . 
   i do n't think norway has really been in a big war and participated in them to the extent as say greece or russia . 
  we were neutral in wwi and occupied during wwii , so yeah . 
   and was n't the invasion rather peaceful since most norwegians welcomed the nazis ? 
  in fact , the invasion took almost two months , longer than any other country than the soviet union . 
  even at its height , less than 2 % of norwegians were members of the [ ns ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nasjonal_samling ) . 
   and you have n't really been involved in any conflicts since then . 
  nothing large-scale , but we 've sent soldiers to various wars . 
  the only thing i could find was a 16 year old news story about someone wanting a military parade which never happened . 
   norway surly has a military parade of some kind ? 
  nope . 
   do norwegians view them as bad or something ? 
  i ca n't speak for everyone , but i view militaries as a necessary evil . 
  not something you glorify or parade around . 
  military parades ( in the style of the russian one ) make me uncomfortable . 
  it 's something you associate with autocratic countries , so i 'm surprised that you have them in france . 
  yeah , it 's a pretty bad photoshop . 
  we still have a de facto one . 
  you are right , it was last * used * in 1933 . 
  i would say that 's the most important year when we are talking about a sleeping law though . 
  it was a sleeping law , but it 's not quite been a hundred years ( last time was in 1933 ) . 
  way to cherry-pick ... 
  nato does n't really work if no one is willing to do their part . 
  why should we expect the us to do everything ? 
  edit : plus , sweden is not a member of nato . 
  i think the coloring in northern sweden ( well , parts of it ) is for sami . 
  g is n't always hard in norwegian . 
  it is soft ( sounds the same as our j ) in the combination ` gj ' or ` gi ' at the beginning of a word . 
   no , he 's in a small apartment with all the luxury goods he asks for . 
  i guess you could consider it a small apartment , but he still has very little freedom . 
  and no , he [ does not ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/10640466/anders-behring-breivik-threatens-hunger-strike-to-get-better-video-games.html ) get everything he asks for . 
  you 're saying it like this is a situation he wants to be in . 
   and now he 's going to enjoy outdoor hiking i do n't know where you get this from . 
  he 's not going hiking just because he wo n't be in solitary confinement . 
   and in 10 years he 'll be back out in the public . 
  there is absolutely no chance that this will happen . 
  in all likelihood he will spend the rest of his life in prison . 
  yes , which is why he is now in prison . 
  it actually used to be a `` big '' thing here before 2011 when it was more easily accessible and the person you looked up could n't find out that you did . 
  nowadays you have to log in , and you can see who has looked you up . 
  sounds like you need to buy better meat . 
  can confirm - norwegian , not offended . 
  although i feel like it needs some [ context ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xqdgf/american_embassy_personnel_try_norwegian/cy76jlv ) for non-norwegians, 
  my impression is that most people eat both , just not necessarily on christmas eve ? 
  i 'm a pinnekj\u00f8tt guy myself , but usually have to eat ribbe on christmas eve . 
  it should be mentioned here that you 're not really supposed to eat these things by themselves , but as part of a meal . 
  a lot of things will look super weird when you put exactly one of it alone on a plate . 
  i have never had this ever , and never heard of anyone eating this for christmas . 
  i know it was a thing some decades ago , but not uniquely norwegian . 
  i 'll give you these 3 . 
  not a a christmas thing as far as i 'm aware of . 
  this is the most popular thing to eat on christmas eve ( 55 % ) . 
  this is the second most popular thing to eat on christmas eve ( 37 % ) . 
  no , just no . 
  no one eats smalahove at any time of year . 
  ( it 's a very local thing ) edit : found some pictures on short notice . 
  [ ribbe ] ( http://static.klikk.no/recipe/2013.12.09/52a5d3c7b83698f50c1f8c9f/ribbe-engebret_big.jpg ) [ pinnekj\u00f8tt ] ( http://stuntsquad.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pinnekj%c3%b8tt.jpg ), 
  it 's probably similar to the situation in norway . 
  it 's mostly old people and the bible belt . 
  even for 2016 , where significantly more oil money is going to be used than in previous years , only about 1/8 of the budget comes from oil . 
  most of the oil money is put into our [ pension fund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_pension_fund_of_norway ) . 
  plus , the other scandinavian countries are doing quite well as well , and they do not have oil . 
  the problem with these things is that they become very one-sided . 
  the child protection services are n't allowed to defend themselves because the details of the cases are secret ( as they should be ! ), 
  the parents of the children in question can therefore make basically any claim they like to the media . 
  i highly doubt that there is some big conspiracy to steal kids from foreigners . 
  that 's another solution . 
  we have some really ugly looking buildings in norway as well . 
  those buildings could look a lot better with some cleaning and a new coat of paint . 
  based on who paid for the ad i would say it 's anti-trump . 
  but americans living abroad are typically more likely to be democrats anyway , so just getting people to vote is enough . 
  i 'm not saying it 's not ignorant of op , i just did n't detect the the scorn that / u/marcusluty did . 
  i 'm guessing the financial crisis ? 
  i found a [ report from 1995 ] ( https://www.ssb.no/a/histstat/rapp/rapp_199504.pdf ) that deals with this exact question . 
  it 's in norwegian , but you can look at the graph on page 28 ( page 29 of the pdf ) , which displays the median age of when people out based on the year they were born . 
  the left graph is for men , while the right graph is for women . 
  as you can tell , this age has n't changed much for those born after 1940 ( and even earlier depending on which curve you look at ) . 
  those people would have moved out long before we found oil , so no that has n't changed much . 
  i would go crazy if i did n't move out at 18 . 
  i 'm also not sure if my parents would be very happy if i stayed for more than a year or two more after finishing high school . 
  it 's pretty much expected in our culture that you should move out as soon as possible . 
  they still move out . 
  he is talking about the situation in denmark . 
  it 's the same where i live in norway . 
  that does n't mean that he is judging those from different cultures , just expressing surprise . 
  all these things will rapidly improve once electric cars become more popular . 
  tesla 's `` cheap '' model 3 is coming soon , and it 's inevitable that other manufacturers will have rapid charging as well . 
  yes , there is an awkward transition period , but there is no way around that .
