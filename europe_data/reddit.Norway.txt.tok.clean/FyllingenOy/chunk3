  the north then invaded the south again two years later and captured saigon , at that point the americans had n't been in the war for two years . 
  vietnam was not a military defeat for the us . 
  i think norway should have haakon vii or olav v. 
  the reason why tr\u00f8ndelag is dark red is probably because of ntnu . 
  how often there are polar bears in the streets . 
  also , a canadian once asked `` how in the hell do you handle the cold '' as if fucking ** canada ** does n't have much , * much * colder winters than norway . 
  the lowest temperature ever recorded in my city was -16 \u00b0 c. 
  not using your indicator properly in roundabouts . 
  texting and driving . 
  drinking and driving . 
  honking at learner drivers who have stalled the engine . 
  sweden , denmark , england , portugal , turkey . 
  yes , i did mean mena immigrants . 
  i should have been more clear . 
  kurds make up about a third of all immigrants from iran , and as far as i know , they 're integrated pretty well along with the persian iranians . 
  all the kurds and persians i 've met have been very secular and spoken norwegian as fluently as a native speaker . 
  i do n't think i can give a more detailed insight than that . 
  other than my own it 's either finnish , swedish , or english . 
  this is completely anecdotal , and i do n't have any statistics to back this up , but i feel like iranians in norway are better integrated and more open to the local culture than people from other immigrant backgrounds . 
  these are the early design concepts . 
  the actual notes look much better than that . 
  you can own guns as long as you 're a member of a gun club or have a hunter 's certification . 
  weapon can not be fully automatic or be capable of burst firing . 
  my parents had 5 kids and i 'd like to have at least two . 
  either no kids or more than one kid . 
  speaking anything other than your own regional dialect is very much frowned upon in norway . 
  my own dialect can be pretty different from the way they speak in oslo . 
  for instance i speak with a guttural r , while easterners roll their r 's . 
  only the southern half of western norway has the guttural r . a few differences ( very few ) between my own bergen dialect and the oslo dialect : oslo : ** hva ** . 
  english : ** what ** . 
  english : ** you ( plural ) ** oslo : ** er ** . 
  bergen : ** e ** . 
  english : ** is/are ** oslo : ** ikke ** . 
  bergen : ** isje ** . 
  english : ** do n't / not ** oslo : ** jeg ** . 
  english : ** someone/somebody ** oslo : ** hvor ** . 
  english : ** where ** . 
  sorry about the messy ... `` graph '', 
  i support their cause , but their methods are borderline retarded . 
  vandalism against innocent people 's property and hooliganism against people who are n't nazis wo n't do anything other than turning everyone against you and it certainly wo n't do anything against actual fascism . 
  worst : valley girl . 
  like totally . 
  best : appalachian . 
  this is n't my actual house , but it 's identical to [ these ] ( http://krogsveen.no/var/krogsveen/storage/images/itmobjects/1663041756/pict/1544007409_lightbox.jpg ) houses that are in the same neighborhood 100 meters down the street from our house . 
  our one has a third floor built into the loft like those three to the left have . 
  yes , i thought it was pretty good . 
  the pinchcliffe grand prix . 
  from 1st to 11th grade , english is a mandatory subject . 
  you can also choose an english subject as an elective in 12th and 13th grade ( if you 're taking a-levels ) , usually something like english literature or international english . 
  starting from the 8th grade you have to pick either german , french or spanish ( some `` fancy '' schools offer stuff like chinese ) , which you will then take until the 12th grade . 
  i picked german . 
  the incredibly annoying cringe epic [ `` l\u00f8rdagspizza '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nygi0cof6e ) ad and song became a huge viral hit in norway in 2006 . 
  it topped the charts for 8 weeks . 
  i like texas a lot . 
  very interesting culture and history . 
  asia : japan or vietnam africa : ghana or botswana north america : usa . 
  canada close second south america : uruguay or chile europe : norway oceania : australia, 
   you just do n't like that a muslim mena immigrant is behind your country 's oil success , because it does n't fit your agenda of `` white = good '' and `` non-white = bad '' . 
  what the fuck ? 
  i know who he is . 
  giving him all the credit for norway 's oil success is sensationalist crap pushed mainly by americans who love their tall tales of one man heroes `` that nobody 's heard of '' saving the world while completely ignoring the political and economic climate of norway in the late 60s . 
  you know , when you say dumb shit like that you make us all look like arrogant twits . 
  a lot of that has to do with the fact that norway was already a well functioning social democracy with a pretty high living standard at the time we found oil . 
  lol what ? 
  anecdotal i know , but in my experience young and old people in norway tend to share a live and let live attitude about a lot of stuff , while the people aged 40-60 are more likely to be the ordnung muss sein types with the `` rules are rules are rules '' pro bureaucracy attitude . 
  i like the red one that comes in the green cans . 
  fanta exotic i think it 's called ? 
  shame there is n't a sugar free version of it though . 
  if i want orange soda i drink solo . 
  i prefer local bergen brand friele . 
  i do n't think you can get it outside of norway though . 
  wanting these `` back '' is really just banter though . 
  in-n-out . 
  gordon ramsay has said he really likes their food , so that 's got to mean something right ? 
  stikk og piss - go take a piss din far er ti menn - your father is ten men brenn i helvete - burn in hell et drit - eat shit ( regionally specific to bergen and the surrounding area ) kuksuger - cocksucker skinkerytter - ham rider ( derogatory for gay ) fittetryne - cunt snout kuktryne - dick face/cock face r\u00e6vh\u00e5l - more profane term for `` asshole '' h\u00e6stkuk - horse cock ( northern regional specific ), 
  if the book was originally written in english i prefer to read it in english . 
  especially if the author has a particular style that is recognized , like hemingway or hawthorne , or if the book is considered a landmark of english literature , for example ulysses by james joyce . 
  ulysses ' use of the english language is what makes it great , and therefore reading a norwegian translation rather than the original english would be a downgrade . 
  i 'd say the same for danish and swedish books . 
  absolutely . 
  i live in the suburbs of bergen , and the coldest temperature ever recorded here was -16,3 . 
  the average low for all the winter months is above zero . 
  yep , summer of 2001 when i was six . 
  it was pretty dope . 
  meh , it is n't really * that * cold . 
  we have a fireplace in the living room to cozy it up during the winter . 
  other than that we do n't have any heating . 
  `` o canada , our home and native land ... '', 
  i would hate living in the far north or one of the more remote areas of western norway . 
  anywhere with less than 4000 people would be too small for me . 
  that 's what i 've heard , but do n't take my word for it . 
  i tried googling it just now and it 's really hard to find any solid information . 
  i 've never been to switzerland , but from what i 've heard and read , switzerland seems a lot more conservative ( culturally , not necessarily politically ) than the nordics . 
  also , from an outsider perspective , switzerland comes across kind of like a country sized [ stepford suburbia . 
  ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/stepfordsuburbia ) for example , the law outlawing dogs barking , where the police can and will confiscate your dog if you 're unable to train it to never bark , seems completely alien to me . 
  of course , that is just my perception and the reality may very well be very different . 
  edit : forgot to say that these things feel like the biggest differences between the nordics and switzerland . 
  estonia , czechia , slovenia or east germany . 
  i 've never heard anyone use the term `` continentals '' , but `` the continent '' is common . 
  this is probably because the only land border sweden and norway have with the rest of europe is far away to the north east with northern finland .
