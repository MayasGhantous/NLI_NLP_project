  either the pacific northwest ( the nature ) or texas ( the culture ) . 
  maybe wisconsin ( the beer ) . 
  i would not like to live in mississippi or the dakotas . 
  norwegians = badass vikings raping irish nuns and slaughtering defenseless english coastal communities is n't very badass to me . 
  the period that came after the viking age ended is a lot more interesting to me . 
  spicy tomato soup . 
  i love the accent most germans seem to get when they speak norwegian . 
  it sounds almost like a mix between norwegian and danish and has a very `` proper '' sound . 
  there 's a swedish version of skam ? 
  being called norway is much better than having to suffer english speakers butchering `` norge '' . 
  we call your country \u00d8sterrike , which is a direct translation of \u00d6sterreich . 
  norwegian police in general : yes . 
  police in my city : not a snowball 's chance in hell . 
  incompetent idiots the lot of them . 
  probably . 
  it 's got a cool sound to it , but i hear it 's pretty difficult . 
  australia , nz , canada , or israel . 
  norwegians would definitely be in the other cauldron with the russians . 
  johnny , ronny , frank and tommy . 
   my favorite is stavanger dialect you 're probably the first person not from stavanger to say that . 
  only if the majority of the people living in those areas want to be norwegian . 
  if they do n't want to be part of norway it would be morally indefensible to want those areas back . 
  yes , although i do n't really watch it . 
  fuck sweden , marry iceland , kill ... russia probably . 
  stop with the threats russia , ffs . 
  i agree . 
  i think our flag is beautiful . 
  the only acceptable alternative for me would be the [ royal standard . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/norwegian_royal_standard_flag.png ), 
  i do n't know much about him , but from what i * do * know , he seems like a real piece of shit . 
  sour cream porridge or rice porridge with sugar and cinnamon . 
  putting ketchup on spaghetti is only acceptable if you live in a cardboard box in the woods and do n't have anything to make a sauce with . 
  `` neger '' , the norwegian version of `` negro '' was the acceptable term for a black person until at least the 90 's . 
  mayonnaise . 
  true : norwegian men get massive erections and women get more moist than the everglades when foreign countries and people give us any attention . 
  `` oh my god , we matter !, 
  someone out there knows we exist !!!!!! '' . 
  false : the weather is terrible and ice cold . 
  in fact , norway 's not very cold at all , a typical midwestern us winter will be much , * much * worse than a norwegian one . 
  it may rain a fair bit , but honestly who gives a crap about that . 
  my water comes from a mountain lake reservoir at gullfjellet , east of bergen . 
  lion ( monarchy and government ) fjord horse reindeer in the north ( and in the mountains further south ) , deer in the west , moose in the east . 
  we 've been using the hk416 ( which is great ) for a decade now . 
  before that we had the ag3 ( which kicks like a motherfucker ) ; a norwegian variant of the german g3 rifle . 
  special forces use the colt canada c7 and c8 . 
  probably king [ haakon vii . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/haakon7.jpg ), 
  based solely on mythology it 's probably odin , but he 's a god , so i 'm not sure . 
  based on the `` king in the mountain '' archetype , olav tryggvason is probably most similar . 
  he brought christianity to norway and fought hard against the foreign leaders who wanted to partition the kingdom . 
  he was defeated in 1000ad at the battle of svolder and norway was partitioned , but his defeat was so spectacular ( he had 11 ships ; went up against nearly 100 enemy ships and was destroyed ) that it 's kind of gone down in legend . 
  the idea is that he went into a hopeless situation that meant certain death in a last ditch effort to protect the country , thus giving everything for norway . 
  after the battle there were rumors that he 'd escaped through a miracle and would return in norway 's greatest hour of need , similar to the king in the mountain-role that king arthur has . 
  storbritannia , which just means great britain . 
  it 's important to note that nationalism does n't just mean one thing . 
  people tend to think of nationalism as being exclusively xenophobic , homophobic , either subtly or openly fascist , imperialistic , and expansionist , even though nationalism in its basic form is n't about any of that . 
  nationalism in its most basic definition is about national sovereignty , the right to self determination , national unity based on culture and language , and a healthy dose of patriotism . 
  nationalism is the reason why most people think ireland should be independent from the uk , the reason why slovakia should be independent from hungary , why the baltic states should be independent from russia , why norway should be independent from denmark and sweden . 
  ethno-nationalism and the racism and bigotry that comes with it is a blight on humanity . 
  civic nationalism , or `` left wing '' nationalism , is not . 
  as for the question , i would think the majority of norwegians fits the description of a civic nationalist , even if they 're not aware of it . 
  the same is probably true for most people in europe . 
  roughly june 20th to august 20th . 
   haha , that 's a new one definitely not `` a new one '' . 
  rock music is considered to originate from america by practically everyone . 
  if rock music is n't american , what is it ? 
  it 's called `` tsjekkia '' in norwegian , so i much prefer czechia . 
  17 to 20c , sunny , but with big puffy white clouds and a nice breeze . 
  all over the place really , but the counties of \u00d8stfold , hedmark , and certain parts of oppland and buskerud are stereotyped as having a higher percentage of rednecks than the rest of the country . 
  once a week usually . 
  mostly local ( norwegian ? ), 
  salmon . 
  midt\u00f8sten , literally `` the middle east '' . 
  about 20 \u00b0 c all year . 
  fitte = cunt fittetryne = cunt face h\u00e6stkuk = horse cock ( northern norway mainly ) svarte = black ( this is honestly impossible to translate properly . 
  has nothing to do with race or ethnicity ) faen = fuck , shit , damn ( all legitimate translations ) helvete = hell faen i helvete = fucking hell ( technically means satan in hell , but that 's archaic ), 
  dirty dancing . 
  love actually too , but that 's more a christmas movie than `` chick flick '' . 
  it 's just a row of wooden houses . 
  blue eyes are very common , but blonde hair is n't nearly as common as people think it is . 
  light brown is a lot more common than blonde hair . 
  rickets is commonly known as `` englelsk syke '' , which means english disease . 
  we also have '' \u00e5 ta en spansk en '' , which translates to `` to take/do a spanish one '' which denotes a quick , easy solution that 's illegal or on the fringes of the law , i.e taking an illegal u-turn when no other cars are around . 
  there was a concept of mor norge ( mother norway ) , but it 's not that well known anymore . 
  fedrelandet , which basically translates to `` the fatherland '' is often used when referring to norway poetically , while motherland is never used . 
  edit : an alternative translation for fedrelandet which may or may not be more accurate is `` the land of our/the fathers '' . 
  democracy . 
  i have enough money to drive to sweden every two years for a dental appointment . 
  yes on both questions . 
  it 's important to stress however , that the requirements should be exactly the same for both genders . 
  in the `` laundry room '' which also contains our first aid/medicine cabinet , our hot water tank , our wellington boots , and our cleaning appliances . 
  `` turd that would get slaughtered by the critics if it were n't a norwegian movie '' is definitely a genre norwegians are familiar with . 
  palmes\u00f8ndag - palm sunday skj\u00e6rtorsdag - sheer thursday langfredag - long friday p\u00e5skeaften - easter eve f\u00f8rste p\u00e5skedag - first easter day andre p\u00e5skedag - second easter day i 'm not sure if we have any words for the monday , tuesday , and wednesday of easter week , at least nobody i know calls them anything . 
  pretty green i 'd say . 
  [ here 's a street view from my neighborhood . 
  ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/@60.3361123,5.2669506,3a,75y,131.75h,87.04t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1se2a1uwvgn2glj6orhcajsw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ), 
  definitely gamla stan . 
  you mean the buick grand national ? 
  i definitely want one if that 's what you 're asking . 
  considering that the airfield is still operational and the attack was just about `` sending a message '' , i think it was really just a giant , pointless waste of money .
