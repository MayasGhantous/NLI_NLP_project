you did n't specify that your post only applied to certain countries . 
  i disagree . 
  here in norway it 's normal for 18 year olds to make $ 25 an hour + bonuses working in a super market with no experience . 
  yet we have one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in all of europe . 
  data for the other european countries , most up to date i could find : * switzerland : 8.2 * norway : 9.2 * croatia : 21.9 * bosnia + herzegovina : 47.3 * serbia : 42.5 * macedonia : 54.9 * albania : 35.5 * russia : 18.3 * turkey : 25.3 http://www.indexmundi.com/map/?v=2229, 
  problem is that the eu is a completely arbitrary group , it would be more logical to at least include the other european countries if you are trying to examine the voting behavior of europe . 
  where do you get that info from ? 
  tesla 's webstore lists the cheapest p70 at 548k , which i do n't think is much more expensive than when it was released . 
  only the most expensive version , p85d is 818k . 
  if the price has increased somewhat recently it 's because nok has lost over 40 % of its value vs usd since last year , not because of increased fees . 
  evs are as cheap as ever as far as fees go . 
   omg , thatwasajoke.jpg oh , haha sorry  as for the refugees ' influx ... maybe , just maybe , they should stop breeding like bunnies . 
  ah , i forgot , their imaginary friend does n't allow them to wear a condom . 
  well , maybe they need to put some efforts into construction and education , instead of killing each other and blowing things up . 
  as for this , you should watch this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvk1ahrf78, 
  incredibly short-sighted view imo . 
  this is the whole planet we are talking about , not just your area , and everything is connected . 
  global warming will cause huge areas of land to be uninhabitable due to for example droughts or loss of permanent fresh water sources and the inability to grow crops . 
  millions if not billions of people will have to move to survive . 
  you think the immigration crisis in europe is bad now ? 
  we will probably face immigration waves of a ** hundred times that size ** this century due to global warming . 
  the fact that your area is not that badly affected will prove to be a mixed blessing , as all the people who live in the areas that * are * affected will flee to precisely your area . 
  it will be absolutely crowded , your society and economy will be pressed to its limits and beyond , and your standards of living will be forced to plummet to accommodate everyone else . 
  europe as a whole pollutes a lot too . 
  maybe not as much as some others , but enough for us to be able to make a difference . 
  more than japan which you mention for example . 
  basically , if everyone thinks it does n't matter what they do because they are an insignificantly small contributor , then we 've lost . 
  bad for the world, 
   fact is , nobody wants to deal with them . 
  untrue , speak for youself . 
  i have no problems with taking in refugees , and i think we should accept as many as possible . 
  breivik filled that quota for at least another decade, 
  surprising that finland had so few . 
  i heard they have a great school system . 
  i think your native language is some uralic . 
  i 'm gon na take a wild chance and guess something sami . 
  i guess we 've done a lot of things right , but we 've also done a lot of things wrong . 
  generally i 'm not really a fan of borders anyway so it rubs me the wrong way to consider being proud of my country , an arbitrary group of people who i do n't have much more in common with than for example other scandinavians . 
  interesting . 
  why does lack of oxygen ruin night vision ? 
  i wonder how good stars look from the himalayas, 
  we 're busy finding elementary particles, 
  jesus dude , just go on the street and ask anyone . 
  pretty much all popular science articles on this subject assume that people think apes mean modern apes and thus have to specify that we did n't descend from modern apes . 
  many of them even go as far as saying that we did in fact not descend from apes at all because for all purposes the word ape mean modern ape as far as the mainstream public goes . 
  just take a look at this search : https://www.google.com/search?q=man+descend+from+apes+common+ancestor * none * of these articles just say that we descended from apes . 
  they either have to specify that we are talking about ** earlier ** apes or deny that we descend from apes . 
  that should tell you something on how big of a misconception this is , and you are not helping clearing it up . 
   if you 'd assume that means modern day mammals , that 's entirely your mistake . 
  except that 99 % of the population would assume that apes mean modern day apes . 
  which makes it the textbook definition of the word `` misleading '' . 
  at best it 's a highly misleading statement . 
   but intelligent design means god has a direct hand in the design of some features of organic life , which is in direct contradiction to the natural selection of evolution . 
  not necessarily . 
  god designing the universe in a way that it lets itself evolve life definitely falls under the term intelligent design . 
   when esben larsen was asked whether he believed people descended from apes , he avoided the question . 
  that does very much suggest he does not believe that , and that is not compatible with evolution . 
  well , perhaps because he knew that we ** do n't ** in fact descend from apes . 
  humans and apes have a * common ancestor * which we both descended from , in parallel . 
  i might have to get my popcorn ready, 
  i 'm not saying they should vote yes . 
  i 'm just saying that 's what they should vote if they really want the eur . 
  the unfortunate truth is that you guys have to agree to the austerity if you want the eur , you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
   please note : more than 80 % of greeks here want the eur and to be in the eurozone . 
  this referendum was not a europe-not europe , euro-drachma question . 
  it was a referendum of more austerity or not . 
  that 's so strange , why would they vote no then ? 
  although that is not what the vote is directly about , it should be obvious that if they want to stay with the eur they need to vote yes . 
  when exactly will the results start coming in ? 
  is there a live news page or something we can look at ? 
  yes, 
  i 've always wondered who googles phrases like this . 
  what do they hope to get out of the search result ? 
  are they looking for something , or just using google as a venting mechanism or something ? 
  reads like a doge meme, 
  well laws like that usually reflect , and are reflected in , society , are n't they ? 
  i did n't quite understand that score . 
  mostly the fact that netherlands scored lower . 
  if norway is anything like sweden and denmark ( and it is , right ? 
  ) , i do n't see how they can score higher on indulgence than a country that has legalized things like soft drugs and prostitution . 
  it would seem to me that netherlands is much more `` loose '' . 
  it will dilute the votes of informed people with votes from people who have no idea what any of the parties stands for and could n't care less . 
  it will probably also lead to less political diversity , because most of the people who do n't care are just going to vote at random for the first party that pops into their mind , and that will be one of the bigger parties . 
  so the bigger parties grow even bigger without actually having more support , strangling political minorities and leading to an imbalanced result . 
  it 's kind of outrageous to cite religion as the grounds for new laws in this day and age . 
  i like it . 
  in contrast to many other subreddit themes there is little if any wasted space vertically , yet it still feels roomy and comfortable . 
  color scheme is well thought out , looks good and has good contrast for ease of reading . 
  on my screen i have no issues with the sidebar but i could understand if people did n't like it though . 
  taste is subjective . 
  i would n't be surprised if americans think their food taste better than ours . 
  turning off street lighting sounds like a terrible idea anyway , for traffic safety and such, 
  source ? 
  it 's clearly a beautiful grassy field , do n't you see it 's art ? 
  there is one important point that seemingly all these news reports and protests fail to mention ( luckily there is always a commenter that points it out , and today that will be me ) , it is that the child protection service will not under any circumstances comment on specific cases publicly , for the sake of privacy of the kids i believe . 
  whatever reason , this means that anyone can come out and make whatever claims they want against the cps , without any retorts or consequences . 
  this is what has fueled the media storm : emotional stories from parents who have had their kids taken away , but there is no evidence that it is true , you only ever hear one side of the story . 
  there is a way to fight your kid being taken away , that is based on facts , that is in court . 
  norwegian court is very reasonable , every case is taken seriously ( just look at anders behring breivik ) and if you have the law on your side , you win . 
  the cps are not above the law , they have to prove their case thoroughly in order to keep kids away from their parents .
