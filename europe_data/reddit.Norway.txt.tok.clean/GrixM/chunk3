  if frp was allowed to run free it would look quite different i bet, 
  that 's your government 's ( and by extension your ) fault for not making cleaner power plants . 
  starting at around 205k nok ( 21700 eur , 24300 usd ) . 
  can get used for like half that price, 
  it 's mandatory if they say you have to go , but far from everyone is told they need to go . 
  these days only ~ 20 % of potential recruits actually get conscripted . 
  so saying that all people above 18 has to serve 1 year , or that almost all males have undergone basic training is a big exaggeration . 
  you have n't posted any actual evidence * at all * , so why should i believe you ? 
  but i guess that 's understandable as the issue boils down to our views on human nature , which after all is subjective and unprovable , so this debate is pretty pointless . 
  you think religion , particularly islam , causes these people to be hostile and and the way to `` win '' is to remove islam . 
  i think religion has little to do with it , and that muslims , like everyone else , can and will be peaceful if they have access to 1 ) a stable environment with all living necessities , and 2 ) love , respect and freedom ( including to have whatever religon they want ) , and the way to `` win '' is to work towards providing everyone with this . 
  unfortunately for me , people like you exist , and unfortunately for you , people like me exist , so we will prevent each other from realizing each other 's solution as we both think what the other suggests is crazy and will just make things much worse . 
  so we 're stuck in this stalemate where we will never know who is right and nothing substantial will be done , the only thing we can be sure of is that people will keep killing each other to at least some degree . 
  yay . 
  i seriously doubt many of the claims you make . 
  your source-but-not-really certainly does n't lend any credibility . 
  lets look at the [ violence rates in africa ] ( https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/crime-statistics/international_statistics_on_crime_and_justice.pdf ) for example . 
  africa has a good mix of both christian and muslim countries , so it will serve as a good reference . 
  if you look at page eleven you see that the top three countries with the three ** lowest ** homicide rates are tunisia , egypt and morocco . 
  what do these countries have in common ? 
  they are predominantly muslim . 
  now what are the three countries with the ** highest ** homicide rates ? 
  south africa , ivory coast and burundi . 
  care to guess what religion these very violent countries predominantly use ? 
  that 's right : christianity . 
  but still , let 's pretend that everything you said is true : it still does not mean islam is inherently the source of all the violence and certainly not that actively working to rid the world of islam would help in any way . 
  as i said i firmly believe this would only aggravate the hostility and extremism , kind of like a morbid barbara-streisand effect . 
  remember what terrorism is : it is the act of causing terror . 
  the terrorists want us to be afraid , they want us to respond with oppression . 
  because they know it will further their cause . 
  instead we must respond with love and understanding , in practical terms foreign aid to bring stability to the region and a lack of hate , racism and hostility against their demographic to show them we are both on the same side , that we are n't out to hurt them or take away their values including religion , this will leave them without a motive to fight us . 
  i also do n't understand your point about how normal muslims `` look the other way '' . 
  they certainly do n't , every single muslim i know are extremely exasperated at the terrorists . 
  it is very frowned upon , certainly not accepted in the community as you make it seem . 
  what else exactly do you suggest they should do ? 
  take up guns and personally fight the extremists ? 
  would you do that and risk you and your families life ? 
  also , you called me an apologist , i would claim that you are actually the apologist here . 
  my opinion is not controversial . 
  you might have been spending too much time on the internet in conservative echo chambers . 
  i do n't agree at all . 
  the subset of muslims with any sort of hostility against other cultures is extremely small , they just make a lot of noise . 
  and these kinds of people are n't just in islam , we here in norway realized this keenly with ut\u00f8ya . 
  islam itself is not the problem , and in fact `` limiting '' islam would only worsen the problem because it would deepen the `` us and them '' feeling some people have and turn more people extremist . 
  god fucking damnit can people just stop shooting each other for one second, 
  you do n't think eu contributed at all ? 
  and yet it 's a thing for norwegians to drive across the border to sweden just to shop because food is even more expensive here, 
  it 's too early . 
  we need way more automation of essential industries like healthcare , education , food production , etc. 
  before this becomes viable . 
  we talk the talk but in many cases we do n't walk the walk . 
  looks like they will have more success than when they opened in norway and was forced to retreat a couple of years later due to poor results, 
  as long as it 's really used for defense and not attacks , i admit it 's a bit comforting, 
  i wonder whether it 's because of anti-vaxxers , immigrants who did n't get vaccinated in their native country as kids , or just inadequate vaccination programs in general . 
  the number for norway is 22.3 in 2015 . https://www.ssb.no/en/transport-og-reiseliv/statistikker/vtu/aar the number for switzerland is 33 in 2013 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate, 
  what about the conflict in northern ireland killing thousands of people ? 
  wait what , why is australia even in there ? 
  is n't this a european song contest ? 
  electric cars fix a whole lot of problems that hydrogen cars do not . 
  this is just completely wrong . 
  in practice we see that fossil fuel cars are far more likely to catch fire . 
  even in catastrophic failure of an ev battery it wo n't simply release all the energy at once and explode , there are tons of safety measures to prevent this . 
  no one has even been harmed in an ev directly by the battery malfunctioning . 
  and your explanation of carrying energy is also nonsense . 
  carrying fuel is carrying energy just as much as carrying a battery is . 
  wierd , i 've always written `` giraff '' in norwegian , did n't know `` sjiraff '' was an accepted spelling, 
  western europe is peaceful but let 's not forget there is in fact actual warfare going on in other parts of europe . 
  namely ukraine etc, 
  standard notation is only one digit before the decimal , so actually it should be 1.5 * 10 ^ 2, 
  the definition is very vague at best . 
  ask different people and you 'll get a different answer as to what left/right means . 
  some say it 's socialism/capitalism , some say it 's liberalism/authoritarianism , others , like you , say it 's progressive/conservative . 
  some parties are `` left '' on some of these aspects and `` right '' on others . 
  and describing news bias in these terms is especially meaningless as it 's often not even about politics . 
  til `` don '' is a verb in english, 
  just `` can accommodate '' is not really good enough . 
  every new coal plant should at the very least be mandated to run with co2 catching from day 1 . 
  and it 's not just about climate change and pollution , coal plants is also just a bad investment . 
  today coal might be cheaper than most other sources , but it wo n't stay that for long . 
  it 's estimated that f.ex solar will be on average cheaper than coal in mid europe in just 13 years or so ( http://www.kic-innoenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kic-innoenergy-solar-pv-anticipated-innovations-impact.pdf ) . 
  then you will be stuck with coal plants that you either have to shut down or keep running at inferior cost than alternatives . 
  either way the lifetime cost of the plants will likely not be a good deal at all . 
  who the fuck decided to build so many coal plants last year ? 
  such poor judgement on all levels . 
  [ the `` top gaining searches '' for almost every country ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g9ehxtu.jpg ), 
  does this apply to electric vehicles too ? 
  if so , why ? 
  i mean they probably generate a little bit of local pollution via road and tire dust , but far less than any combustion car . 
  exception from these kinds of restrictions would be good to boost their sales too , which would do wonders for the local pollution levels long term . 
  i mean there are words of people buying a second car just to circumvent this , why do that when you can just buy an electric car that works all the time . 
  jesus , that 's got ta be literally lethal with regular clothing, 
  laser pointers in fog like that is mindblowing, 
  i never did . 
  the only thing you have taught me is that you are missing the point . 
  like i said , completely missing the point . . 
  at least clinton said she got the popular vote in her after-election speech . 
  you 're completely missing the point . 
  what you call the internet is n't anglo-centric , the community on the www is . 
  so the `` internet '' is irrelevant to this discussion . 
  also , as for your last paragraph , as i said it does n't matter where berners-lee was born .
