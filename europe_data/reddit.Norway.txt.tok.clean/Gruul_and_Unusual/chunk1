the border between europe and asia is at the ural mountains in russia , which means a large part of russia 's territory is in asia , and a smaller part is in europe . 
  but russia has always been ruled from the european part of its territory ( whether it 's kiev , novgorod , moscow , st.petersburg , depending on time period ) , so it 's a european country , with a lot of land in asia . 
  norwegian prisons are based on principles of rehabilitation and making sure former inmates can reintegrate as useful members of society once they 're released . 
  it reduces the tendency of prison to act as a `` crime school '' or `` radicalist school '' ; that 's the idea anyway . 
  the author was a proponent of scandinavian unionism and the song was written in honor of all nordic countries , but with specific focus on sweden and norway since they were in a personal ( royal ) union at the time . 
  unfortunately the union was a lot more popular in sweden than in norway , and the song did not retain popularity in norway after the dissolution of the union . 
  it 's still a very beautiful anthem . 
  it 's the royal motto , imagine the king prefacing it with `` i would do '' , and you get the idea . 
  come on , those are classics . 
  yes , and although they 're no longer pegged to the same value the norwegian , swedish and danish crowns still are n't that far apart value-vise .

  [ the original song as performed by david hasselhoff for the movie kung fury . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztidn2dbyby ), 
  several muslim congregations ( including the largest one ) are threatening to leave islamic council norway because of this . 
  a prohibition against `` completely covering the face '' in schools and universities are underway ( i think there 's a majority in parliament for it ) . 
  point is , this is n't just blindly accepted , even among muslims in norway . 
  this is my experience in norway as well . 
  the state run monopoly stores have great selection , skilled staff , low mark-ups ( even on high-end items ) and generally nice stores . 
  the only real disadvantages are limited opening hours , and poor shop coverage in rural areas . 
  of course , high alcohol taxes also feel bad , but those are n't directly related to the system limiting sales to state run stores . 
  my french is n't super , but i think you 're quoting different numbers from op . 
  table 1 in the pdf refers to the percentage * of people * who drink wine or beer , not the percentage of their alcohol consumption that each kind of drink represents . 
  if you instead look at figure 2 , you 'll see the number of glasses per week . 
  the number of glasses are roughly comparable for beer and wine , and given that wine has a much higher alcohol concentration you 'll find that it is n't far off from op 's numbers . 
   southern dude ... 
  the chart says you do drink beer ( 10 % - 20 % of total consumption ) , you just drink a lot more wine . 
  it 's more that almost everyone drink coffee regularly , i think . 
  10 kg a year is only equal to about 2 cups a day . 
  but every person who does n't drink coffee at all would pull down the average significantly . 
  so mexican coffee drinkers probably drink in comparable amounts to northern europeans , it 's just that * everyone * drinks coffee here , to the point where i get weird looks if i decline a cup in social situations . 
  iceland clearly was n't included in op 's chart . 
  it does n't mean that iceland drinks less coffee than all the countries on the list , just that whoever made the list did n't bother to include iceland . 
  as you pointed out , iceland would 've been in the top , had it been included . 
  / u/mvlad88 / u/kingofmonaco / u/exiledasher check iplameinreallife 's link for data on bosnia and mexico . 
  i know several people who drink 8 cups a day . 
  it 's above the national average , of course , but it 's not an abnormal amount for regular coffee drinkers . 
  the national average is lowered considerably by the demographics that drink no coffee at all , which means the coffee drinkers have to make it up in order to get to the ~ 2 cups a day equivalent average . 
  this only works in cups where the top is wider than the bottom , and not straight cylindrical cups . 
  the vodka will dilute the colour of the drink and make it absorb less light , but it will also increase the height drink that you have to see through . 
  for cylindrical cups the effects cancel each other out . 
  [ beer lambert law on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beer%e2%80%93lambert_law ), 
  thanks , i was really wondering why poland was so comfortable with this . 
  poland has a larger acceptance than germany and all other central european and eastern european countries in the poll . 
  not exactly what i 'd expect from the traditional , religious and conservative poland . 
  a pleasant suprise i 'd say . 
  yes it is , animism , spiritualism , ancestor worship etc. 
  are all religions . 
  religion , as a term , is wider than just theist worship . 
  it would n't suprise me if there 's something similar in most of the western world , really . 
  heathen does not equal pagan ( worshipping other gods ) . 
  heathen just means you do n't follow an abrahamic religion , which means heathen includes pagans , as well as atheists . 
  i think the numbers for `` i do n't believe there is any sort of spirit , god or life force . '', 
  is more interesting than `` i believe there is a god . 
  '' , because a lack of belief in a `` god '' does n't really mean a lot if you still believe in some kind of `` spirit '' . 
  you might not identify as christian/muslim / * other * , but believing in spirits and life forces is still a religious stance . 
  thanks for posting the source !,

  do we count russia ? 
  it 's a european country , and it does have more railway than germany , it 's just that a lot of that railway is in asia . 
  what happened ? 
  privatization followed by downsizing , or something else ? 
  that map does n't show length of railway networks , but relative density of railway per area . 
  the maps shows km of rail per 1000 square km of area . 
  norway , which has the lowest density , still has a fair length of railway because the area is large . 
  at about 4000 km the norwegian rail system is longer in total length than that of belgium ( about 3600 km ) and not too far off that of switzerland ( about 5300 km ) , but it 's spread out over a much bigger area , so the density number ends up very low . 
  rail network density is still an interesting number , but calling it `` longest railway '' is very misleading . 
  way too clear , i could understand what he was saying . 
  it sounded like a danish person living in norway . 
  minke whales are n't endangered , the population is healthy .

  i 'm expecting europeans to post that mcdonalds is n't good enough and i 'm expecting americans to post that mcdonalds is too good for inmates .

  couple of points about the entry on norway . 
  the letters \u00c5 \u00c6 \u00d8 are usually presented in the order \u00c6 \u00d8 \u00c5 by norwegians , because that 's the order in which they appear in the norwegian alphabet , at the end , after z. norwegian often uses the local names for foreign locations , if the local language uses the latin alphabet ; and when we do we use the diacritic marks of that language . 
  so cologne is usually marked as k\u00f6ln on norwegian maps and in norwegian encyclopedias . 
  i do n't know if this too niche for \u00f6 to be added to the norwegian entry , but it 's available on norwegian keyboards . 
  the \u00c5 is only about a hundred years old , before which it was written aa , which is still how many names are written , among others the heir to the norwegian throne , his royal highness haakon magnus .
