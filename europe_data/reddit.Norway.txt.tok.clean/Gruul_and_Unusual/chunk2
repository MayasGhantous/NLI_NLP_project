  implying that johaug has been deliberately taking performance enhancing drugs by posting a picture of * someone else * seems disingenous , even if bj\u00f8rgen is on the same team . 
  bj\u00f8rgen has n't tested positive for doping , btw , so if she 's been taking something it 's stealthy stuff . 
  if you want to make a point about johaug you should post [ an uncropped image ] ( http://1.vgc.no/drpublish/images/article/2012/01/16/23158362/1/990/1436383.jpg ) .

  reading dutch feels the same for us . 
  during the height of the refugee crisis there were reports of for profit housing providers charging `` whatever they could get away with '' . 
  the government were desperate for housing and had little room to negotiate until they could get their own housing up and running . 
  the high costs ran for a short period , and only for a limited number of the refugees , so it 's not reflective of the average costs of refugees over time . 
  that is , if the 9000 $ claim is even real . 
  i understand that a younger , more progressive , crowd might be more likely to respond with a non-straight sexual orientation than your average russian ; but that does n't explain why there are so many bisexuals compared to gay/lesbian/other . 
  7.11 % is way higher than the american average as well , ( do n't know about the average of american reddit users specifically though ) . 
  that 's a very large percentage of bisexuals ( 7.11 % ) . 
  anyone know the reason ?

  is there any way to intertwine the three royal houses of sweden , denmark and norway again ? 
  [ cattle of europe , nrf , aka norwegian red ] ( http://www.bondevennen.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bv37_fag1.jpg ) come in red and black , horned and polled , milk and dairy ; such diversity in a single breed .

  danish people claim otherwise , but the resemblance is uncanny . 
  the one eating the bun is prime minister erna solberg . 
  the one with the massive jewelry is the former mayor of bergen , trude drevland .

  try ebay , a quick search for `` 0 euro note '' gave plenty of results for me . 
  ( note that some of them are out of print and therefore expensive collectibles . ), 
  in english : 0 $ notes are souvenirs printed on real money paper , with security measures typical of real bank notes . 
  they are printed with various motifs e.g. 
  brandenburg gate , coliseum , big ben , and sold at museums and the like for 2 or 3 $ . 
  they 're popular with collectors and tourists . 
  [ google translate of the wiki page ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2f0-euro-schein&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  the plural and singular form of the norwegian word for sword/swords are both `` sverd '' , however there are clearly three swords so the plural form should be used . 
  the definite form of `` fjell '' is `` fjellet '' , so including the definite article `` the '' is not correct . 
  as for rock/stone , the word rock is less ambigious since `` swords in stone '' could be interpreted as swords * made out of * stone . 
  not a linguist , but fluent in norwegian and english . 
  `` fjell '' in norwegian can both mean mountain and rock or stone . 
  in this context `` rock '' is more accurate since the sculpture is placed on rocks by the sea , and not on a mountain . 
  it 's also the translation used by [ english wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sverd_i_fjell ) , which means the writers there consider it the most common english translation . 
  the swords are over 9 meters tall , and not sharp . 
  i 'm guessing there 's a solid bit in the ground , to make them stand stable , but i do n't know any details about it .

  swords in rock, 
  no , you will be shaming the memory of the king that united medieval norway . 
  those numbers are true for 2014 , but the seychelles , being a small country , is subject to a lot wilder swings in per capita incarceration rates than the u.s. which has consistently high rates . 
  if you look at a bit wider trend you will find that the u.s. is number 1 here far more regularly than the seychelles . 
  we have the same idiom in norwegian , your correct version with ** around ** . 
  interestingly , the percentage for norway [ is larger than the percentage of the religiously unaffiliated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_norway ) . 
  likely because a lot of members of the church of norway are in fact atheists , but that 's speculation on my part . 
  if your parents are members of the church of norway , then membership is `` opt-out '' and a lot of people do n't bother to leave the church since it makes zero difference in everyday life if you 're a member or not . 
  thanks for clearly stating that it 's `` convinced atheists '' , the distinction is often lost in this kind of presentation . 
  do you have a source ? 
  and metals are doing well , compared to oil . 
  half a poland seems like a politically correct unit that no one , surely , would take offence at . 
  [ wikipedia : tourism in iceland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_iceland ), 
  all i see are the old norse grouped together with the swedes and the geats as `` northmen '' , and i like it . 
  it 's labeled 1900 , not 1910 . 
  and in 1900 norway and sweden were in a personal union ( i.e. 
  same king ) , so labeling them both in the same font size , but giving them the same colour seems like a decent choice . 
  i do n't know about bulgaria , but i 'm guessing from your reaction that op was wrong on that one . 
  norway is mislabeled here . 
  possession , of any amount , * can * be punished with prison , fines , or both . 
  in practice , the police often just give fines for possession of small amounts , but some people do spend time in jail for possession of cannabis . 
  is n't there a two-dollar note ? 
  discontinued as legal tender in 2012 , you can exchange them at norges bank for a couple more years , 2022 i think . 
  same with the norwegian parliament . 
  i guess bored politicians who do n't even show up for uninteresting votes is a pretty universal thing . 
  when you consider china 's massive population that 's still only one member of parliament for more than 450 000 citizens . 
  in comparison , norway has a ratio of about 30 000 citizens per mp , if it had a ratio similar to china , the storting would have 11 members . 
  do n't feel bad , i bet it was more fun to find out this way . 
  it 's not the year of the battle , it 's to convey that there were 18841 battles for the isonzo river before it . 
  [ with almost continuous combat in the area , the precise number of battles forming the isonzo campaign is debatable , but the last one was pretty decisive .

  in the case of norway it 's mostly immigration . 
  there were more immigrants than births in 2015 .
