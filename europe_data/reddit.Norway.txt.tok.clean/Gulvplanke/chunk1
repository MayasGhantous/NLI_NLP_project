  i pay you to supply me with weed and suck my dick , not to insult my gardener-plumber-carpenter . 
  i want samskandinavisk .

  then you treat everything as if it was a salmon . 
  we have a drink called akevitt here . 
  same reason . 
  an authoritarian regime with more money than sense sounds perfect . 
  also , almaty has slightly colder and far snowier winters than beijing , and has in fact the same level of precipitation as oslo in february as well as being right next to a mountain range . 
  why ? 
  that is the most homoerotic thing i have ever witnessed . 
  `` what the fuck 's a luxemburgh ? '', 
  - stereotypical american, 
  i was in skopje this summer and i got a text from what i assume was the macedonian tourism board that said `` welcome to macedonia , ** the cradle of civilization ** '' . 
  so not only are they the cradle of western civilization , but of civilization in general . 
  [ matka just outside of skopje . 
  ] ( http://www.exploringmacedonia.com/content/images/matka/large/matka%20-%20goran%20anastasovski%20%282%29.jpg ) beautiful place, 
  late 13th - early 14th century . 
  after 90 years of civil wars and before the black plague . 
  [ this was our empire .

  pretty boring . 
  they should replace it with [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xriyt-mrvai ) . 
  who needs lyrics ? 
  it 's not uncommon for swedish men to look like women . 
  yes, 
  but some will be more equal than others . 
  cool i 'm icelandic now !, 
  could definitely be worse . 
  so the area where civilization first arose does n't have a long history ? 
  time for some reconquista !, 
  we would get even richer ? 
  so , for an intervention we need a non eu country who is not dependant on russian gas and is not on great terms with them in general ? 
  / r/perfecttiming edit : it 's already there . 
  [ i do n't like this game ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ol1zvqj.png ), 
  they are not breaking any laws . 
  we have our fair share of heroin addicts here in non-oslo as well . 
  does n't j\u00e4mtland have one as well ? 
  that seems to be unavoidable in the balkans . 
  luckily i do n't speak illyrian , so no one understands what i 'm saying anyway . 
  true , but that does n't sound as pretty . 
  well , from now on i will start calling it illyrian . 
  no , we forgvie them when they give us our colonies back . 
  and north of denmark . 
  you 've got an apperance of virgin mary . 
  that 's quite something !, 
  [ nope ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_liberalism ), 
  two muslims does something horrible and all muslims are to blame . 
  thousands of muslims protest a horrible act , but that does n't count because they are only a small sect ? 
  stop being a caring so much about what other people believe would be a start . 
  it 's because we have something called freedom of religion . 
  it means that everyone can believe what ever they want to believe whitout fearing persecution . 
  if you do n't like it there are several countries who do n't , countries you would live in fear if you wanted to practise your religion . 
  i hear north-korea is nice this time of year . 
  you should choose a zionistic jewish leader . 
  this will cause iran to invade , and history shows that nothing unites the greek like a persian invasion . 
  problem solved . 
  true . 
  it belongs to norway . 
  no , the first one was a train ride between bergen and oslo , then came the ferry followed by another train ride and then the firewood thing . 
  xc skiing and biathlon i believe . 
  i really like theese . 
  really ? 
  you should try doing [ colorado ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lkey3j5.png ), 
  behold my ms paint skills : [ europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gl5lixz.png ) i really messed up britain, 
  if i were to make my own village , it would look like that . 
   the fuck !, 
  some where in the europe is actually doing good economically ? 
  what was that ? 
  i ca n't hear you over sound of all this money . 
  divineking is a racist troll . 
  not as far as i know . 
   so well formulated  turkish apes we have different ideas on what well formulated means ( unless bpc edited his comment ), 
  [ this bulgarian ] ( http://no.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/16vkn5/attempted_armed_assault_on_turkish_politician_in/c7zsjy1 ) in / r/worldnews suspects it was set up . 
  i think that your comment here was idiotic because you completely missed the point , but that one comment is not enough to determine wheter or not you actully are an idiot . 
  there is also the possibility that i might be an idiot and thus in no position to judge others . 
  i usually do n't approve of calling peple idiots , but in this case it 's perfectly valid . 
  edit : come to think of it , i still do n't approve . 
  one swallow does not make a summer . 
  what about athletics ? 
  ice hockey ? 
  tennis ? 
  football ? 
  all dirty sports and , save from athletics , do n't show a desire to change , they just pretend it 's not happening and refuse to investigate suspicious athleats . 
  as for your son , he would most likely never turn pro adn even if he did he would n't have to cheat . 
  there are several hundreds of professonal cyclist out there and the most if them do n't use doping , and the number of cheaters is dwindling fast . 
  you can tell this because the preformences are getting worse . 
  not many sports can say the same . 
  what the fuck ? 
  this has nothing to do with children . 
  what 's happening in cycling is that they are trying to stop doping rather then pretend it does n't exist . 
  it 's far from the dirtiest sport out there . 
  / r/mapporn might be interested in this . 
  you should stay away from norway then . 
  by this logic i associate myself with breivik because i call my self norwegian . 
  the guy used to post racist stuff , but then he realized he would get banned , so he started posting strawman stuff instead . 
  that says more about you than this sub . 
  i can confirm that all the swedes are all raving homosexuals . 
  so close . 
  i was thinking more that they were fat because the were hungary , but i suppose you can interpet it either way .
