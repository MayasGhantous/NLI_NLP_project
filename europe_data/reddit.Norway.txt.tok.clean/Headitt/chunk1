  ### the sultan of malaya , the great crisis of asian affairs in the previous session , the sultan had to make a decision . 
  envoys from around the world had warned him of a `` great war '' heading his way , and thereby gave a new long term order : [ * `` we ca n't afford ambitions in south america , we must do a first strike to prevent the end of our nation-state as we know it !, 
  '' * ] ( https://youtu.be/c-wo73dh7ry?t=214 ) in 1523 the great crisis began , fearing arab intervention we decided to strike before they could reorganize . 
  war was declared on kilwa , as he had sieged up almost all of malacca . 
  we began to desiege malaccan provinces , but pasai was taken . 
  japan intervened swiftly , but we kept control over the the war with a solid +40 % warscore . 
  we had no means to stab hit him so the the war of attrition commenced . 
  after 6 years and rebels everywhere kilwa surrendered at the loss of 1 ( 1 % warscore ) colony . 
  however his nations was battered , leading to a collapse from war exhaustion gained from blockades and occupation . 
  the naval battles were a mess , but the most heroic victory was made when 6 heavies and a ton of trade ships/transports beat the japanese navy consisting of 30 heavies and 30 transports . 
  when peace was made , even though or demands were miniscule , it 's effects were devastating . 
  may this be a lesson to any arrogant fool demanding land in indonesia while disregarding even my most gentle compromises . 
  * kutaian gunboat diplomacy is a slow and incidious killer . 
  * in other news , malaya will be formed next session , further legitimizing all kutaian claims on indonesia and it 's pacific holdings . 
  i wish to congratulate ajuuraan , kilwa and japan for a well fought war . 
  may all the gold , men and ships lost be a lesson to any player wanting a piece of the indonesian pie . 
  i 'd also like to congratulate my allies for a well fought war , and showing unity in an outmost dire situation . 
  [ the sultan of malaya informs it 's dismissing all claims of a grand scheme to stop it 's expansion .

  i 'm currently playing as a sunni nation . 
  all you 've done is playing against my interests , henceforth why i have a reason to address you as problematic . 
  #kutai the sultan of malaya - prelude to the great crisis of asian affairs our session was overall calm , and we managed to progress with good results in our colonial ambitions . 
  with the current schedule our experts expect us to land in the new world by the end of the next session . 
  furthermore we accumulated territorial gains across all sectors . 
  ** the sultan sent envoys out to all corners of the world to gather intelligence on the current balance of power in the world : ** ### the first envoy from europe reported the following : `` grave news my sultan , england has fallen to the danes . '', 
  these news gave valid reason for concern , the sultan met with the amf ( asian monetary fund ) , where they agreed to proceed with the following countermeasure . 
  to fund europe in hopes of regaining it 's strenght , as it now was under attack from both the arab alliance and the rogue nations stirring unrest from within . 
  ### the second envoy gave even further reason for concern : `` mighty sultan , russia has broken through the ural-wall , and as we speak thousands of them are flooding through the cracks ! '', 
  the sultan fears bukhara to be next in line , and we can not allow further nation-states to be annexed by this horde , the sultan requests the asian alliance to prepare for crisis talks with india . 
  ### the third envoy from the new world informed us of the arab alliance 's ambitions in south america : `` my sultan , words from the new world bring reason to act swiftly , the arabs are colonizing all over the new world ! '', 
  the sultan proceeded to send word from nations in the new world , and further envoys give us reason to suspect they are aiming to empower the nation of carib to do their bidding . 
  we can not let this happen without further diplomatic talks . 
  our newborn alliance is now facing threats from all sides , and we are bound to be forced to chose which war to fight for . 
  kutai fears this session was nothing but a line of powder lined towards the keg . 
  it may only be a matter of time before it reaches it . 
  `` my sultan , we have an envoy from malacca !, 
  '' , we did not ask for an envoy from malacca , however the pragmatic sultan gave the envoy time to speak his words . 
  `` kilwa has landed in malacca , the africans are invading ! '', 
  will kutai chose to save south america ? 
  fight back the russian hordes at the ural wall ? 
  or send his ships to face the invading african scourge ? 
  then we have japan , and his grand armada and excellent infantry , who will stop him ? 
  may the next session bring answers . 
  * `` our empire will prosper , untill some damned foolish things in mainland asia puts it all to a brutal end . 
  kutai will be ready for the [ fifth session !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asxks8nyu8q ), 
  sounds like my average singleplayer games . 
  i wish you good fortune in future sessions !, 
  send an envoy to bengal for a `` greener '' future . 
  good game , i 'm sorry i had to send that dagger through your back . 
  i hope to see you return !, 
  it 's not too late to repent .

  kutai wishes to inform any territorial trespasses from japan will be handled . 
  their rebellion will be crushed . 
  ### [ kutai , the sultan of borneo , majapahit and the phillipines * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ituhpjbbvcc ) ** in what way does kutai play this campaign : ** being a cunning diplomat by bluffing and backstabbing , turning allies against each other and making sure kutai always is on the peacetable of the victors ( being a dick ) . 
  ** prelude : ** for weeks , a grand coalition was summoned to put a end to china . 
  partitions and alliances were made beforehand . 
  we took note of the aggressive tone of japan , the lack of trust in indochina , and the loyalty of our allies in india . 
  * `` sometimes the pen is mightier than the sword . 
  '' * japan 's aggressive tone further strenghtened our doubts when he told us `` let 's force rebels to spawn on ming '' . 
  as if a 300 % peacedeal would n't shake the balance of power already this gave valid reason to concern the reliability of giving japan this territorial power . 
  in kutai 's eyes , these petty conflicts are but a distraction from the greater threat . 
  horde refugees swarm all over asia , somethings astir west of the ural-wall . 
  the russians are coming , and with them the west . 
  being dispersed as many small nations will not strenghten our cause to halt this advance . 
  we saw it as necesarry to strenghten the current strong nations to brace for this unseen threat to the north-west . 
  ** [ how did it go down ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6nw7xvtyn0 ) ** ( you get to see the funny side of things , go rewatch the red wedding if you 're into that . ), 
  first kutai-malacca striked majapahit and china answered the call to arms . 
  then bengal declared on china with the rest of india behind . 
  followed up by a declaration from indochina and japan . 
  suddenly during the war , an order from kutai was sent to bengal and china , and peace was made with economical and territorial exchanges . 
  indochina and japan was now all alone . 
  bengal then declared on ayyuthaya to further put them in disarray . 
  [ before and after operation red walkyrie ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/tlrgw ) ** post-action ** the balance of power in asia is still in disarray , however kutai will make sure the destabilizing factors are rooted out in due time . 
  for now , [ this triple alliance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdcrznrypno ) has been born . 
  the sultanate of kutai also wishes to applaud malacca for successfully aquiring colonialism in indonesia . 
  a perfect victory to counterbalance the western powers . 
  * some territory may lack full integration, 
  the sultanate of kutai begs the world to put their eyes on china this session . 
  the council has been in contact with several foreign dignitaries . 
  [ it 's time for the world to see the power of the diplomatic skills of kutai . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygcff7xazfk ) the lannisters send their regards . 
  the ministry of propaganda can not confirm nor deny the following statements mentioned above . 
  please contact your nearest kutaian diplomat for further information regarding the weekly statements . 
  ### kutai - the sultan of borneo , emir of the phillipines , ruler of the spice islands and it 's dependencies ** in what way will kutai play this campaign : ** being a cunning diplomat by bluffing and backstabbing , turning allies against each other and making sure kutai always is on the peacetable of the victors . 
  the sultan adressed the nation with a sentence few would believe , * `` peace in our time '' * . 
  the diplomats of malacca and kutai had been adressing the conflict , and came to the conclusion of a peace deal that would not only restore the balance of power in indonesia . 
  it would forevermore guarantee a lasting peace in the region . 
  the sultan waved the signed treaty signed by sultana-regent azura gunungjati to the noblemen of kutai . 
  this war became more a show of force and prestige for us , and so our noblemen cheered . 
  little had they been aware of the damage this war could have caused our alread wounded country , and now was the time to heal our wounds . 
  sultan suraprabhawa i. kartanegara began pushing for internal reforms . 
  the autonomy given to the princedom of brunei were to be withdrawn effective immidiately . 
  and the estates were subject to a shakedown to make sure our nation state would n't be prone to disasters of any kind .
