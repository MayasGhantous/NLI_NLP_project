  guess which department had the money to do that ? 
  you guessed it !, 
  the department of * culture * . 
  edit : thanks for correcting me !, 
  we will have a streamer , / u/jtalin returns !, 
  asian hegemony achieved , may the empires last a 1000 years . 
  i 'd like to congratulate my allies in securing a well fought victory . 
  we were at war with great britain and the netherlands , while fighting alongside them vs france-austria with condotierri . 
  following it up with an additional war vs sweden once they were winning . 
  make bukhara great again : \u2714 d-day great britain and secure london : \u2714 give butua all of jerusalem : \u2714 war sweden twice : \u2714, 
  it 's at the moment unknown if we 'll have someone stream the finale or not . 
  do n't make us build a wall !, 
  there was no way bukhara alone could survive endless waves of swedish troops unless a * significant * amount of money came out of nowhere . 
  we suspect that maybe a certain someone sent 20k ducats to the west to give them a fighting chance . 
  the mughal hegemony grows ever stronger , after last weeks coup attempt the chancellor is now back in power . 
  ** update on war plans : ** operation tannenbaum has made great progress , the sabouteurs will be crushed ( manchu and japan ) . 
  operation felix : the cape is soon to be 100 % in our posession , we are awaiting french confirmation . 
  operation marita : our troops have successfully pushed the persian border back to it 's historical boundaries !, 
  operation achse : being redrafted due to interational events changing . 
  operation acshe will now get new objectives . 
  * `` michael gove told the bbc 's andrew marr the change was about `` taking back control '' of uk waters , 6-12 miles from the coast . 
  '' * for the love of god , please read the article before you spew bullshit . 
  as usual , we seem more obsessed on exterminating our 60 remaining wolves rather than preserving them because the farmers lost some sheep , which they leave unattended . 
  oh , and it 's not the norwegian wolves that are killing them , it 's the swedish ones that have recently crossed the border . 
  ** chancellor thundershield of the mughal hegemony ** the session was rather tame , after rumours of western transgressions in asia came to be false . 
  however , we did make our precense known to the world with our sincerest support to the freedom fighters in europe . 
  plans are now in motion to be commenced in the session to come : - operation achse - operation tannenbaum - operation felix - operation marita, 
  ** from malaya to the mughals ** since i 've been nomited chancellor of the mughal hegemony , i will no longer attend to the internal affairs of malaya . 
  i wish good fortune and cooperation with those who stand by asian integrity . 
  my first decree will be [ to remind the western powers that we do not tolerate any further transgressions . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcbkvr_pgay ), 
  assalamu alaikum the double entante ( malaya-mughals ) wish to inform the world that we do no longer pursue any goals to the west now that we have settled the border dispute . 
  in the event the borders get transgressed upon , we would have to reconsider . 
  ma'a salama, 
  i made the call by mistake since the walls where breached and we had positive siege score . 
  due to terra icognita , i could n't see how close persia and his allies where to us . 
  considering we had 60k infantry there , i assumed we would be able to take the fort with 10-15k infantry losses . 
  which would secure our southeren positioning and give us a good spot to hold against a future offensive . 
  kilwa here , after a series of unfortunate events related to disasters , stability hits and overextension . 
  my nation imploded and my march will carve up my remains . 
  as i 'm gone the next week , i will not be able to host . 
  a replacement should be found , 
  do n't make me create another 300k + asian alliance army by 1530 again !, 
  [ mrw i looked at europe ] ( https://giphy.com/gifs/tiger-kris-woods-q6c6pftfu5k3s ) kilwa reports that project `` bm '' is proceeding as planned . 
  no european shall infringe on our sovereignity , and all will tremble !, 
  if you 're really into condotierri , any nation can increase their mercenary force limit ( which is the prerequisite for the condottieri limit aswell ) by chosing the following ideas : +25 % administrative idea 5 : mercenary recruitment plutocratic idea 1 : tradition of payment quantity idea 5 : mercenary contracts espionage-quantity : the mercenary registration act +5 % war taxes ( not accounting for unique national bonuses ) source : http://www.eu4wiki.com/army#mercenary_support_limit,

  i welcome scheming and promise to be discreet . 
  hey / r/europe , it 's the time of the week to unleash your inner imperialist !, 
  the 10th session of our eu4 multiplayer game is going to start at 18h cet on the clock ( lobby opens at 17h30 so be there at that time ) . 
  if you 're an old timer , you might want to just go ahead and start plotting and boasting on the following thread . 
  [ here 's a list to our previous streams and also , we need a new streamer . 
  if you are one , step forwards at once ] ( https://www.twitch.tv/videos/143287156?t=2h03m10s ) if you 're a ** newcomer and you wish to join , we encourage you to come join us !, 
  ** ## - go to the [ / r/europe discord ] ( https://discord.gg/yf77gcw ) , type '' . iam eu4 '' in chat and start talking with us in the eu4 channel and on voice at 17h30 cet . 
  ## - check [ the map , the available countries and the countries that need subs for this session ] ( https://hackmd.io/kynglcbmbgbmambaazadjadkwwbwajouvaiyj4iizadgwjjanea=?view ) so that you can see which country you want to pick and start doing a little diplomacy . 
  ## - read and agree with the following rules : - no exploits/cheating of any kind . 
  - no nation ruining after losing a war . 
  grow some balls for heaven 's sake . 
  - if you hold a country , you may be absent for one session and be ** protected ** if you find no sub . 
  missing two sessions in a row without a sub means you abandon your country and it is up for grabs . 
  - you must set your ai settings at the beginning of the game so that your ai does n't declare war or breaks alliances . 
  ( press escape while in game and it should be one of the options in the menu ) , if you do n't you can not benefit from protection if you crash or must be absent and your ai attacks somebody . 
  - if someone is protected , do not attack them , do not take provinces , if you find yourself at war , white peace . 
  do not loot provinces , or destroy armies and fleet if you can avoid it . 
  - you can not pick a vassal nation after the start of the game unless agreed upon by the overlord . 
  - you can pick colonial nations . 
  but you get a single war of independence . 
  if you fail , you count as `` annexed '' and have to leave the game . 
  then that specific colonial nation becomes unavailable for picking any longer . 
  - if too many people crash or if somebody important crashes in the middle of a war , we will rehost . 
  - ** last rule and most important . 
  ** nations that form alliances with a country already at war can not join that war via `` call alliance '' . 
  if you want to help your ally , use one of the diplomatic actions ( enforce peace , intervene etc ) or declare a separate war . 
  now let empires fall and despots rise and may the odds ever be in your favor . 
  ## important note !, 
  you must rollback your game to 1.21.1 to play with us . 
  right clic on eu4 on steam , select betas and select 1.21.1 . 
  after a short update , it will work . 
  post your plots , achievements and feats !, 
  and do n't forget the memes .
