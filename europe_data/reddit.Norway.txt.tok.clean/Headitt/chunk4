  - you can not pick a vassal nation after the start of the game unless agreed upon by the overlord . 
  - you can pick colonial nations . 
  but you get a single war of independence . 
  if you fail , you count as `` annexed '' and have to leave the game . 
  then that specific colonial nation becomes unavailable for picking any longer . 
  - if too many people crash or if somebody important crashes in the middle of a war , we will rehost . 
  - ** last rule and most important . 
  ** nations that form alliances with a country already at war can not join that war via `` call alliance '' . 
  if you want to help your ally , use one of the diplomatic actions ( enforce peace , intervene etc ) or declare a separate war . 
  now let empires fall and despots rise and may the odds ever be in your favor . 
  ## important note !, 
  you must rollback your game to 1.21.1 to play with us . 
  right clic on eu4 on steam , select betas and select 1.21.1 . 
  after a short update , it will work . 
  ## next campaign will be announced shortly after this final session, 
  post your plots , achievements and feats !, 
  and do n't forget the memes .

  greetings my fellow grand strategy players . 
  we are now reaching the 3rd season of / r/europe 's eu4 campaign . 
  we frequently have 30-60 players and we strive to make the games head into the lategame . 
  unfortunately the last season ended in the 18th century due to lack of players . 
  #what : eu4 , or europa universalis 4 is a grand strategy video game in the europa universalis series , developed by paradox , which specializes in these games . 
  it 's a medieval to early industrialization strategy game where you control a country ( eg france , spain , the ottoman empire , ming china etc ) and try to lead them to glory . 
  in the game you can conquer , colonize , convert people , oppress , be a liberator . 
  mostly whatever you like !, 
  #when : every sunday for 6pm to 9pm cet #where : the / r/europe discord : [ link here ] ( https://discord.gg/yf77gcw ) #faq  what do i need to join the game ? 
  you need ** only ** the ** base ** eu4 game . 
  you automatically get all the dlc the host has in the mp game , so you are fine . 
   i have never played this game before , can i join ? 
  sure but ... eu4 is a very complicated game . 
  it 's hard to manage as is , but in a multiplayer environment what is already confusing can become an overwhelming wild west . 
  i would suggest at least familiarizing yourself with the game before jumping in . 
  finish the tutorial , start and play a game and learn the ropes !, 
   my internet is shit , can i join ? 
  to some extent . 
  we need to be able to finish this game sometime this century , so the minimum speed is speed 2 . 
  if your internet is bad but can handle that , it 's perfectly fine !, 
  if your internet constantly drops the game speed to one or even pauses it , apologies but no . 
  we will have to kick you . 
   i can only play some sessions and not join other sessions because reasons , is that fine ? 
  that is perfectly fine . 
  you can join any session you want and not join the other . 
  you can join for less than 3 hours if you want and drop out when time comes etc. 
  no pressure , we all understand !, 
   is pvp allowed ? 
  pvp is encouraged !, 
  scheme away !, 
   what happens if my internet dies/i dc/i get annexed/i come late ? 
  we will have a scheduled rest at around 19:30 cet . 
  if you crashed/got annexed before that , you can re-join !,
