same over here . 
  but how will we teach our children about the value of money if there are no cash . . ? 
  denmark is back . 
  i missed you !, 
   ei saa peitt\u00e4\u00e4 every heater in every household in norway had that text on a few years back ( together with norwegian and swedish ) . 
  i would be very surprised if the average norwegian can count to 4 in finish though ... never the less - your language is fascinating . 
  that 's like saying you carry a bomb when on an airplane ... 
  some things are never funny . 
  i hope he learned his lesson . 
  to an outsider estonian and finish sound quite similar , although estonian sounds a tiny bit softer . 
  which is slightly worrying ... 
   that beach has rocks . 
  the danes wo n't know what to do . 
  yeah . . you are right . 
  will probably make them go back home . 
  peacefully . 
  so they except muslims but not christians . . 
  we love you too < 3, 
  careful , this might make all the [ danish vikings ] ( https://petenowak2000.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/vikings.jpg ) come after you . . 
  i missed that one . . 
  i believe it 's meant as a joke . 
  you were not the only one . . , 
  i do n't mind anyone rescuing people from drowning . 
  but the right thing to do would 've been to take them back to the shore they departed from . 
  and still you do n't understand estonian ... 
  50 % commenting have not noticed the missing country . . 
  ask denmark if they agree ... 
  you have a problem with denmark ? 
  it 's the white sand i guess . . 
  a couple of lidl shops . 
  well , this should make iceland happy . 
  ( not that i think they have anything against denmark . . ), 
   but hey good reduction to absurdity . 
  thanks . 
   the thing is - we already have laws preventing products reaching the marked that hurt our hearing , eye sight , or other aspects of our health . 
  ( well . . cigarettes are still out there . . ) . 
  '' * meaning : * `` norwegian consumers already choose energy efficient ( vacuum cleaners ) '' * [ source ] ( http://www.dinside.no/bolig/slik-er-de-nye-stovsugerreglene/61209554 ), 
  young people want quiet vacuum cleaners . 
  and they are more environment conscious than older people . 
  so the manufacturers will provide what the young people want . 
  they are after all their future customers . . a vacuum cleaner has the same level of noise ( or less ) as a baby crying . 
  so maybe eu will make regulations for babies as well ? 
  who knows ... 
  but fake advertisement is anyways illegal , and why would anyone buy a noisy vacuum cleaner ? 
  this is what we love about the eu . 
  these kind of regulations . 
  not . 
  seems to be some kind of black-out happening in [ kirkenes ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/place/norge/@70.1119046,27.9394815,6.79z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x461268458f4de5bf:0xa1b03b9db864d02b!8m2!3d60.472024!4d8.468946?hl=no ) ... 
  african . . ? 
  thank you !, 
  if this is real it 's not very child friendly . . 
  not able to open the map . . 
  many more than in sweden and germany . 
   i mean they did get all of europe for this survey nope . 
  only eu . 
  i live in one of the greyed out countries ... 
  i think few muslim parents even allow it . . 
  what 's wrong with the european jews . . ? 
  you would need a us survey to base the map on ... 
  this is a eu survey , hence the grey ( and not included ) countries . . iceland is n't even on the map at all . . 
  no problem . 
  most of europe had very little to do with the slavery . 
  * `` the slave trade was dominated by three main players . 
  france , britain and portugal were the major slave trading nations . 
  '' * [ source ] ( http://www.discoveringbristol.org.uk/slavery/routes/places-involved/europe/ ), 
   whoowhoo , we 've finally beaten finland at something !!!, 
  are you sure you won . . ? 
  we ( norway ) never imported slaves , and we do n't mind black people . 
  so not sure how you got to that conclusion . . 
  my husband and i have a african american friend that visited us a couple of years ago . 
  he is a tall and big guy . 
  he was amazed that no one was afraid of him here , and that everyone was really friendly . 
  he is already looking forward to his next visit . 
  luckily we are attached to sweden . 
  otherwise we would be gone too . 
  ( ` grey ' is the step before ` gone ' ), 
  if they are asked anonymously they have nothing to loose . 
  ( but i 'm too lazy to check how this survey was conducted . . ) , 
  whats up with czechia and slovakia . . ? 
  whats up with czechia and slovakia ... ? 
  i feel so left out ... 
  you can always hang out with switzerland and norway . . 
  greenland is finely becoming green ... , 
  i 've seen many dutch people over here lately . . 
  12 months paid maternity leave + 70 % of child care costs covered by the government do help too . 
  they are not making enough babies . . 
  why would you ( even if you are a journalist ) agree to join a ride in a * homemade * submarine . . 
  video anyone . . ? 
  i thought it was gold raining over poland . . 
  i hope this ends up on the front page ... 
  turkey - welcome to europe !, 
  perfect . 
  then it 's settled . 
  we are the [ happiest country in the world ] ( http://www.bestcurrentaffairs.com/worlds-happiest-country/ ) for a reason . . , 
  the text on the map says the predictions is based on current birth rates . . 
  if it was based on immigration then germany would be the winner . . 
  it was a joke . . , 
  it was a joke . . , 
  according to this map it seems like they would have to include both norway and sweden to that list . . , 
  in norway immigration is actually at the lowest it 's been since 1997 .
