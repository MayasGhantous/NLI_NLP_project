  the main challenge however for a italian or spanish engineer is probably to learn to speak for instance polish . . 
   encourage migration to wealthier eu nations with low unemployment . 
  ( from southern european nations with high unemployment . 
  this is not to be confused with external migration into the eu . ), 
  will only work if the person speak the local language ... 
  i like your other points though . 
  is cheese cheaper in finland ? 
   because of taxes ? 
  more because of higher salaries i think . 
  not sure what a waiter earns these days , but the starting salary for a cleaner is 22 $ / 18,5 $, 
  eating out in norway is expensive . 
  period . 
  ( which is why my family mostly eat homemade pizza ) . 
  i 'm more than willing to pay 30 $ for a pizza as long as i get health care for me and my children , dentist for my children , 12 months paid maternity leave , up to 24 months unemployment money if i loose my job , 70 % of child care costs , care for me when i get old , and education for my children . . that the price of pizza 30 $ pizza is a small price to pay . . , 
  i just worked as a cleaner for one year in between other jobs . 
  starting salary was 22 $ per hour . 
   you got some healthcare for those who are really but not all the poor . 
  plenty of homeless people in the us without any health care insurance . 
  as this map indicates we have no minimum wage , but for instance the starting salary for a cleaner is about 22usd per hour . 
  had no idea it was so . . grey . . 
  apparently . . 
  i guess sweden and finland are considered `` east '' and the rest is considered `` west '' . 
  [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/map_of_scandinavia.png ), 
  it does work well yes . 
  found this : * `` there were , however , more blond vikings in northern scandinavia in the area around stockholm , sweden , while there were more redheads in western scandinavia , which denmark belongs to . 
  '' * [ source ] ( http://sciencenordic.com/what-vikings-really-looked ), 
   or do you mean nation `` outside '' al a switzerland yes, 
  my dad and youngest brother have the same thing . 
  brown hair , red beard . . 
  could be from [ the vikings . . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viking_expansion#/media/file:viking_expansion.svg ), 
  . . and then if you compare this map to a map showing [ the viking expansion . . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viking_expansion#/media/file:viking_expansion.svg ), 
  the opposite is true for nations outside eu . . 
  sweden , it 's time . 
  made me realize there is still quite a few places i have n't visited yet . . 
  too bad germany is too far away to drive there for a weekend . . 
  good point . 
  and a lot less mountains . . 
   the norwegian are notorious for having to much money to `` blow '' away . 
  a quick drive around in norway will tell you that surprisingly little money is blown away on roads . 
  the first time i visited south africa i thought i had come to road-heaven . 
  compared to norway their roads are way better , in spite of having a lot less money ... edit : and [ this ] ( https://www.lofotposten.no/henningsvar/fotball/hil/er-dette-verdens-mest-fantastiske-stadion/s/5-29-142626 ) is a better photo of the soccer field . . 
  but molde is so far away . .  ( the new e39 however i have been following very closely . ), 
  but yes , you are probably right . 
  a sign that you follow world news more than your own country 's news - when the first time you hear about this is on reddit ... 
  we actually have a plan to visit lidl next time we go to denmark on holiday . 
  ( we live only a short ferry trip away from dk ) . 
  would upvote that comment 100 times if i could . 
  . . but what 's up with greece ... ? 
  finland ... !, 
  i think you won . . 
  probably has some interesting history ... 
  they ended . 
  i live in norway , and up here we like rain . 
  it keeps nature green . 
  ( and makes our electricity cheap ) . 
  neither is norway . . :d, 
  they only have [ 3 days of rain ] ( https://www.yr.no/place/croatia/zadar/zadar/statistics.html?spr=eng ) in july ( on average ) . 
  thats not too bad , and in fact it 's less than [ prague ] ( https://www.yr.no/place/czech_republic/prague/prague/statistics.html ) that has 9 days of rain on average in july . 
  seems like you stepped on someones toes here . .  personally i would love to see both croatia and tsjekkia ( our name for your country . ), 
  no , your 're not weird . 
  ( remembering the summer i spent in poland where we had 45 degrees for a few days , until the lovely rain came and took the heat away and we were down to 20 degrees ), 
  but this made a much more interesting photo than a boring sun !, 
  ( says the person living somewhere it rains all the time . . ), 
  how do uk wash their chicken ? 
  normal water ? 
  you got a point . 
  still miss them . 
  `` we do not understand each other '' ( vi forst\u00e5r hinanden ikke ), 
  those were the days . . 
  sorry , [ that is not it . . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ), 
  [ this map ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5sv8bz/all_lidl_stores_in_europe_and_consequently_the/ ) is just sad ... 
  price . 
  more difficult to fix yourself . 
  things go wrong that never used to go wrong . . 
  such a pity that lidl did n't make it in norway ... 
  i remember back in the days when i paid 0,095 british pounds ( 0,1 euro ) for one ice cream in poland . . ( this was back in 1994 ), 
  it 's not the polish prices that are high , it 's the uk prices that are ridiculously low . 
   czech emigration after 2004 is weak despite open borders . 
  that 's a good thing . 
  i know !, 
  i was just saying to my husband the other day that i wish they could just produce a few new cars without any computers . 
  just simple basic cars , nothing fancy . 
  finland is too cold ? 
  they do what to the chicken . . ? 
  he does n't know what reddit is i 'm afraid . . 
  do n't worry . 
  no one can speak danish . 
  i thought i was doing really bad with 62 % . 
  i got 25 out of 40 . 
  once under danish rule , never again !, 
  i had no idea this was a thing outside norway . . 
  i am so horrible at this . . ( 25 points out of 40 ) . 
  i better stay where i am . . 
  very international around here today . 
  one south african ( where my husband is from ) and one australian ( where my brother in law lives ) . . 
  hello south africa  small world . . ( my husband is south african ), 
   medicare covers almost everyone 65 or older , certain people on social security disability , and some people with permanent kidney failure . 
  i think the most surprising thing for me is that all children are not included . 
  since children have no way of paying for their own insurance . .  medicaid covers low-income and financially needy people so you would think homeless people fitted into that category . . ? 
  thanks for explaining .
