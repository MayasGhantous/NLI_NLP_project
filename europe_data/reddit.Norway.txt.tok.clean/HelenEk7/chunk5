  reminds me of [ this one . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jykrtkqkt3w ), 
  hahaha !, 
  ( same here . 
  could even wear a t-shirt today . . ), 
  unfortunately no . . 
  i understand some afrikaans , but can not speak it . 
   but do n't really fancy the cold and the darkness during the winter . 
  you could ask my husband about that - he is from pretoria . 
  the first 2 winters were the worst . 
  he is ok now . 
  so how is indonesia compared to south africa ? 
  south african living in lithuania ? 
  a few years ago i went to a birthday party , and some of the guests were a family from germany that had come to norway to join the celebration . 
  we do a lot of speeches in norway when we celebrate ( birthdays , weddings ) , so the german guy also wanted to say something . 
  he started out saying he was so sorry about what the germans had done to norway during the war . 
  we were all very surprised , as the war was the ** last ** thing on our mind . 
  but it was his first time in norway , so i guess he felt the need to clear the air - although there was no air to be cleared . 
  only people above 80 still hold a grudge towards germans . 
  the rest of us have no problems with germans at all . 
  ( except the fact that they are way to frugal as tourists - bringing everything they plan to eat and drink while they are here , including coffee and tea ) . 
   and still ` having oil ' is n't a guarantee for your economy to stay afloat no it wont last for ever . . 
  still interesting how the different government handled finding oil/gas . 
  for instance i find it odd that scotland voted against becoming independent - in spite of them having oil . . 
  that guy in blue shirt looks like he is feeling cold . . 
  lithuania does better than latvia . 
  i thought it was the other way around . 
  capitals . . 
  very interesting map !, 
  interesting to see the little blue dots around some of the capitals . . 
  interesting !, 
  i realize i know too little about the dutch history . . 
   because they think norway seems like a fascinating country . 
  well , i guess that means not all americans think norway is the capital of sweden . . , 
  not common for people to study norwegian unless they live here . 
  where do you live ? 
  . . even before oil we had good health care . 
  take that americans !, 
  what did they spend it on ? 
  hey !, 
  i see . 
  if i was a terrorist i would probably rather travel through mexico though . . 
  so the wrong thread to be on when hungry ... 
  i so need to go to tsjekkia ( as we call your country over here . . ) !, 
   and that northern dutch culture is quite strongly calvinist i did n't know . . 
  but now i know . 
  so the us is afraid of a canadian invasion of immigrants ? 
  i find that hard to believe ... . 
  dutch police believe they are jesus ? 
  in the meanwhile in [ norway . . ] ( https://www.abcnyheter.no/nyheter/norge/2017/07/06/195315463/overrasket-av-sno-i-juli ) ( in north of norway it was actually snowing on the 6th of july . 
  luckily i live in the south . . ), 
  same over here . .  yesterday we had 17 degrees . . 
  come north on summer holiday . 
  20 degrees here today . 
  at least you get to practice your german - a lot . 
  i learned german in high school as well , but can not speak it . 
  ( do understand a bit though ), 
  why is the canadian - us border so tightly guarded ? 
  who is trying to stop who from entering . . ? 
  being this small is a really good sign . 
  who wants to live somewhere the police station is huge due to a horrible crime rate ... 
  i would much rather live in a peaceful village . 
  sounds like they do n't really want to there . .  romania - easy to leave , hard to return to . . 
  really ? 
  how interesting . 
  i think if you are born abroad to norwegian parents all you need to do is to go to norway and submit some papers . . 
  do n't the dutch like biscuits ? 
  i however remember travelling from norway to poland , and having to wait for hours getting from germany to poland . 
  i mean hours . 
  but it had it 's charm . . and we ( norway ) did get some border control back for a while when all the syrian refugees started to flood in a couple of years ago . 
  do you speak both languages ? 
  love it . 
   we do n't really have stuff like that , since the border to sweden is all forest ... 
  so i was actually on to something . . , 
  i had no idea finland avoided the black death completely ... edit : light pink = after 1351 . 
  note to self ; read the map thoroughly before commenting . . 
  at this rate it will be empty within the next 81 years . . 
  still a lot in such a short time . 
  humour . . ? 
   in norway , 120 dollars is pocket change . 
  it 's what i spend to feed one of my children for a month . 
   no lol , payed by themselves , through paying taxes when working for decades until retirement . 
  true . 
  but everyone that never worked also get a pension . 
  time will tell . . 
  were n't they vaccinated ? 
  well , this should be easy to control once you have properly brexit ` ed . . 
  i guess that is a good thing if you already own a house there . . 
  really . . ? 
  wow . . 
  it means there were already a ** lot ** of germans in germany already before the refugees arrived ... 
  not me . 
  planning to stay right here . . 
  at this rate some of them will be empty in a generation or two . . 
   how ` bout you ? 
   found it today . 
  haha . 
  it 's free . 
   what brings you to the europe reddit though ? 
  i assume you have been to europe ?
