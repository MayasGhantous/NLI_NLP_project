  and people in sweden seems very `` desperate '' , there is really only one party that is critical to immigration there , and ( from my understanding ) they are pretty crazy . 
  i do n't remember the stuff they support , but it was way out there . 
  but still they won a huge portion of the votes in the last election , primarily because of their strong anti-immigration view . 
  from my impression at least most of the `` common folks '' in europe ( me included ) do n't like the current state of immigration , and as a result the right-winged parties are gaining grounds and popularity . 
   clima is complex issue ( for a good hint how complex it is look for `` wolves change rivers '' at youtube ) . 
  you clearly do n't know what climate is in this context . 
  what these wolfs did was changing the biological diversity witch helped change the local topography , it has absolutely nothing to do with climate . 
  i ` am just gon na trow this in here : [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate ), 
  from my impression its very similar to what we have here south/western norway . 
  rain , wind and temperatures around 1-7 degrees trough the winter and 18-24 in the summer . 
  as for the rest of norway it varies a lot , i live in the mildest part of the country . 
  depends on where you are going . 
  here in norway the summer is a beautiful time where everything is green and lush . 
  in the winter tho its either gray or covered in snow , little to no hours of daylight and with the exception of some winter exclusive stuff most of the tourist stuff is closed . 
  plus a lot of roads are closed as well , and these often tend to be the more scenic roads . 
  but it depends on what you want to experience/do , for instance if you want to experience the arctic and northern lights or something like that winter ( obviously ) is a good time . 
  but other than that most of the cities are gray and `` dead '' , and so is the landscape along the coast ( where all the fjords are and everything is just generally a lot less vibrant , but there are a lot of snow-covered places tho if you like that . 
  here in norway you would have been considered mentally insane if you did something like that , 
  let me see if i got this right . 
  you are american ? 
  and in belgium it was considered wierd to drink coffee at `` random '' instead of after a meal ? 
  in that case i just want to shoot in it that that is not the way we do it here in the nordic countries at least . 
  we love our coffee and drink it whenever we want , there is no social rule that dictates that we can only drink it after a meal , 
  and god forbid they stop at a resting-stop or something similar to let the long line of cars behind them go by . 
  tho your budget is way to low to visit norway i ` am gon na suggest the [ extreme sport festival ] ( http://ekstremsportveko.com ) in norway just in case you decide to increase your budget . 
  edit : doh , i just realized i mixed up the dates a bit , this festival ends on the 28th , so its just a couple of days to early for your scheduled . 
  here in norway they start to teach english from the first grade . 
  and when you reach 8th grade ( age 13 i think ) you can choose a other language as well to learn ( usually german , spanish or french ) . 
  here in norway it is easy to dodge if you try ( i did it myself ) . 
  as for the general opinion i would say most people neither hate or love the concept , its seen by many as a test of manhood and `` ritual '' to becoming a man , and for those who do n't want to go they can easily dodge it . 
  glad to help !, 
  yes i ` am a from norway , 
  norway would be a great contender here . 
  a lot of [ beautiful landscapes ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=norway&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=tx0kvbi3othcanxygigo&amp;ved=0cacq_auoag ) scattered with `` villiages '' , both [ small ] ( http://a.dilcdn.com/bl/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2013/09/adn809492small.jpg ) and a [ little bigger ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ciyquek.jpg ) . 
  plus if you travel in the summer ( which is really the only time for a road trip in norway ) you can experience the midnight-sun if you chose to travel far enough north . 
  i just copied this from your last thread that was deleted just as i was about to post : i think norway has to be among the top there . 
  as you can see on [ this map that shows population-denseness ] ( https://www.ssb.no/a/kortnavn/beftett/fig-2012-09-06-01.gif ) most of the people ( total population is only 5 million ) live in concentrated areas along the coast , that leaves all the rest of the country mostly uninhabited wilderness ( there are of course a bunch of small villages scattered around ) . 
  and when you look this [ map of europe ] ( http://pages.uoregon.edu/dluebke/301moderneurope/europe_population_today.png ) you can see that the nordic countries are the most rural places in general . 
  edit : with area to you mean country or just a area within a country ? 
  edit 2 : if you mean area within a country i think i most be the norwegian island of svalbard , it only has a population of 2,642 , and is a [ decent sized island ] ( https://messengerpigeonz.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/svalbard-map.jpg ) close to the north pole . 
  edit 3 : i forgot about the island [ jan mayen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_mayen ) witch is located in the middle of the north sea with a population of 18 . 
  a couple of years ago i used to get an american radio station here in norway , i think it might have been broadcasted for american military bases or something ( not that we have any of those here in norway , i think the closest is located in germany ) . 
  but there has been about 3 years since last time i was able to tune it in . 
  other than that i have never experienced a foreign radio station here . 
  i have to say tho that it sounded ridiculous , the content i heard on that channel would fit perfectly on / r/murica . 
  i think the station was called `` the eagle '' , and most of the commercials and radio hosts was so overly patriotic that i still to this day is not 100 % sure that it was not just a parody of some sort . 
   taking actual holiday time for moving i do n't know how this is in the rest of europe , but here in norway many employers give you one paid day of from work for moving . 
  ( its usually limited to one day each year ), 
  we neither . 
  i do n't really know , but if i where to guess i would not think so . 
  the us music-market is the mecca of western music , its where everyone wants to break trough . 
  but to do so you firstly need a good song , but also a lot of money and the right contacts . 
  so if a song is made and released in the us by some of the `` right people '' it has already broken trough the biggest market and can go directly on to the rest of the world . 
  but if a song is made and released in for instance a european country it has to make its way from there to the us market , and without the right contacts etc that can take a long time , or just be right out impossible . 
  in my own opinion at least there are a lot of songs just here in norway ( song in english ) that are just as good as many of the songs topping the us charts , and that i belive could make it big . 
  but since they are unable to break trough the us market they do n't get popular and well known enough to actually reach its full potential . 
  yeah i totally agree , that is why i wrote `` you would theoretically know three languages  '' , it was meant as a bit witty . 
  but if you know norwegian you also know swedish and danish ( at least in writing , understanding danish verbally may be bit of a challenge ) . 
  so by living in norway you would theoretically know three languages , 
  since op mentioned scandinavia i would just like to point out that norway can be very expensive for foreigners , so your saved up money might not get you very far there ( but i do n't know how much you have saved up tho ) . 
  so just a little heads up ** if ** you actually where to consider norway , 
  we have a saying here in norway : * there is no such thing as bad weather , only bad clothes * . 
  here in norway it usually starts with a gathering of a few people or many at someones place where you start drinking . 
  around 23:00 people usually start migrating from their `` home-parties '' to the city where they hit the clubs or pubs . 
  the bars and pubs has to stop serving alcohol at 02:00 , so after that people either go home or goes to a `` after-party '' at someones place . 
  this is usually the norm among young people at least . 
  norway : some kids dress up and trick or threat , but that is basically it . 
  we do n't put out decorations , most people do n't buy in candy beforehand to give to the kids and it is really only the kids who cares . 
  most years i have not even had kids come to my house on halloween , so its not exactly a huge thing . 
  but to be fair tho , you guys do n't have to cycle up any upwards-slopes/hills or such , you can just go straight ahead , 
  norway here : many schools ( mine included ) usually travels to poland and germany to visit concentration camps in 9 or 10th grade ( 13-15 years old ) . 
  there are also some who travels to other countries as well some times , but the `` poland-trip '' is the most common . 
  it was a very interesting trip , we visited auswitch , auswitch birkenau and sachsenhausen . 
  there is usually also a `` time-witness '' as we call them that travel along . 
  this is a person who has been imprisoned in a concentration camp during the war and tell stories from the camp and life during the war in general . 
  that autumn temperature sounds awesome , but i would really struggle with rest there , hehe . 
  we had a heatwave this summer with 30-32 degrees ( yes , laugh all you want of our definition of heatwave ) and i was unable to do mostly anything . 
  if i went for a walk i would get so much sweat in my eyes i was unable to see clearly ( i ` am not kidding ) , and i could not to anything in my apartment without a fan blowing on me constantly . 
  with `` late-summer weather '' i do n't mean summer weather , but summer-ish . 
  our summer temperature is usually around 18-24 degrees  what country do you live in that can boast of such nice autumn weather ? 
  norway : it can vary a lot . 
  august is usually warm and stable , september can sway both ways . 
  you can have nice late-summer weather ( as we do right now , 15-19 degrees and sunny ) or rainy weather with 8 degrees . 
  but things always start to go `` downhill '' in september , it gets colder and wetter , and by the end the autumn has usually set in and gearing up . 
  but i ` am primarily speaking on behalf of the southern parts of norway , i do n't have any hands-on experience with the north in this period . 
  but i know the first snowfall has occurred in the north now in september . 
  i ca n't speak for the rest of europe , but here in norway we do it the same way as in the us . 
   most of us still get baptized , married and put 6 feet under by the church . 
  yup , we still carry out the old traditions , but that is all it is for most people , just tradition . 
   still most churches are practically empty ... yeah , it was almost a sad sight the last time i attended a baptism . 
  there was only one family there plus our family who was there for the baptizing , in other words , there was just one family there attending the church because they where religious . 
  it is not a big deal here in norway . 
  most of the people are atheists , and the people who are religious is rather quiet about it . 
  so you never really notice any presence of religion in the normal day to day life . 
  and i feel ( but this is only based on personal experience ) that religious people can be a bit frowned upon , since they believe in such nonsenses . 
  norway , 4 digits . 
  norway here , can confirm it like that here also . 
  norway here . 
  we usually take our shoes of when we come inside the door in the hallway . 
  there are usually a shoe-racks or just a designated area right inside the outer-door to take your shoes of and leave them there .
