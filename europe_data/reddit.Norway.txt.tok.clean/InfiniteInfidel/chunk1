good to see germany say a few harsh words about russia for a change . 
  merkel should stop sucking putin 's dick, 
  too little , too late . 
  they have been sitting on the sideline for years while some of their youth has become extremists . 
  yet only now , that they are put in a bad light by the atrocities by isis , are they doing anything about it . 
  looks like the sjw got to me . 
  do n't get me wrong , their current effort is admirable , but their past efforts havent been . 
  the problem with your statement is that it makes an assumption that this 10,000 strong division is in any way meant to actually stop the russians , it is n't . 
  this reactionary force is meant to be able to mobilize with only a few hours notice and to immediately engage any enemy , so as to give the regular army time enough to actually mobilize and prepare for war . 
  you for real ? 
  pointing this out is racist . 
  if you do n't mind , i would love a source for that , i had n't heard anything of it . 
  why ? 
  all that has happened is that norway is not happy with the recent undemocratic things that have taken place in hungary . 
  and we will not be paying them any more subsidies unless they change their ways . 
  hungary is completely justified in ignoring us , but then they wont be getting our money . 
  i really do n't see an issue here . 
  surely hungary is so mighty they do n't need our pathetic subsidies , right ? 
  right ? 
  first order of business , create a northern defense alliance with norway , finland , sweden and denmark . 
  let this be a precursor to sweden and finland joining nato since two countries of this hypothetical northern alliance are already nato members ( denmark and norway ) . 
  ` murica, 
  at least we beat the swedes ... 
  are they sent back ? 
  i hope they are . 
  if they want to enter europe they can do it legitimately . 
  the more these people keep pissing off europeans with there extremism the better . 
  perhaps finally there will be some consequences for their incessant saber rattling . 
  russian politicians are like most politicians , logic is not a requirement . 
  no , it is not time to move . 
  it is time to tell the russians to fuck off . 
  good . 
  take your country back from the russian ( and a few local ) aggressors !, 
  when were russians really ever about protecting other russians and not promoting their leaders desires ? 
  no , no it will not . 
  if russia used nuclear weapons shit will go down . 
  there are n't many people ( even pacifist which permeate several western countries ) would sit idly by if russia started nuking europe . 
  it is n't so much that protecting jews against violent protestors . 
  it is more to do with the fact that no `` sane '' politician would dare criticize any minority for anything for fear of being labeled a racist . 
  because they came to the west because the west has it good . 
  and the west has it good because of western thinking . 
  if you come to the west you are obviously seeking a better life and should adopt the way of thinking that allowed life to become so good ( in the west ) . 
  if not , you could potentially go back to your place of origin , especially if you think it is so much better than the west . 
  just my two cents though . 
   `` we 're not anti-semites , we 're here for the people . 
  ** we call on europeans and americans ** to finally do something , '' the organisers said at the start of the march . 
  so basically , you are telling me that these protestors , in european countries , are not european ? 
  oh , so they had already paid for it ? 
  my bad , i did n't know that , makes it all okey now . 
  / s  ability to sell something as big and expensive as a warship depends on people trusting you to go through with it . 
  i do n't think any ally of france ( nato ) would have to worry about french embargoes ... and no meaningful nation ( with regards to french arms exports ) would be too concerned about france going back on the sale , considering russia 's actions . 
   effectively make it the only country to have a meaningful sanction against russia is france afraid of taking the moral high ground because no-one else is ? 
   and frankly , france is hardly affected by russia in the first place same shit happened during wwii , france was hardly affected by german occupying the sudetenland , but we all know how that ended for france ( and the rest of europe ) . 
  i thought the french had more of a backbone , willing to take charge on the international stage , but i was wrong i see . 
  i still think france should be shamed as fuck for still going ahead with the sale of the mistral-class amphibious warship to russia . 
  it just blows my mind that it seems to be beyond anyone 's comprehension that these ships will be used to project russian military power at the expense of europe . 
  it seems so shortsighted . 
  this is the exact thing that really baffles me . 
  they did it in afghanistan in the 80s and they have done it now . 
  they finance , give intelligence to and generally help out the jihadis , and then get all bitchy afterwards when these jihadis turn heir attention back towards hurting the west . 
  it 's almost like he is doing it on purpose ... to justify all the shit the us does in the name of `` the war on terror '', 
  there is no reason to trust the us with anything you hold precious . 
  that is not what i am saying . 
  have you ever been to the middle east ? 
  they have some of the most xenophobic immigration laws ever . 
  in kuwait you ca n't become a citizen unless you are muslim . 
  try flying something like that in europe and the whole world will throw a fit . 
  this is going to be a controversial comment . 
  i wonder , if the prosperity of the west ever falls and we decide to leave and seek our fortunes elsewhere , if middle eastern countries , african countries and refugee countries in general will be as accommodating as western countries have generally been . 
  ** edit ** for those who do n't understand , what i am trying to say is that i highly doubt , that if everything went to shit in the west . 
  and you had a shit ton of americans and eropeans fleeing war , famine and economic depression , i highly doubt that the welcoming party in lybia , or saudi arabia or afghanistan will be that ` welcoming ' . 
  i know for a fact , that you can not become a citizen of the country of kuwait unless you are a muslim . 
  i know this because i had an arab friend , who was born in kuwait but who 's parents were from lebanon ( and christian ) was rejected when he applied for citizenship in the country he was born in and had spent 20 years in because he was christian . 
  what danger does germany pose to poland ... ? 
  the really sad part is there is shit all anyone outside of russia can do about this , it is a mess the russian 's themselves will have to deal with , which i suspect wo n't ever happen . 
  any foreign involvement will only help to bolster putin 's whole `` the west is fascist '' agenda . 
  i feel sorry for the russians . 
  you 're a bit of a tit if you actually believe that . 
  no-one forced anyone to join nato , they all joined nato because they were tired of being bullied by russia . 
  i reiterate , no one has ever forced anyone to join nato against their will . 
  really interesting . 
  what exactly does `` average tension '' imply ? 
  and rightly so !, 
  exactly right !, 
  russians can name any place within russian borders anything they want , but we also reserve our right to be entirely uncomfortable with their choice and to think negatively of people who would glorify a genocidal mass-murderer . 
  took me 17 seconds to google . 
   the novel tells the story of a small group of cancer patients in uzbekistan in 1955 , in the post-stalinist soviet union . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cancer_ward ), 
  i do n't really doubt you , but i am going to need some sources there matey . 
  how would it `` solve things like halal meat '' ? 
  really ? 
  even after we 've all seen what happens to non-nato countries when russia gets clingy ( ukraine ) ? 
  no surprise really . 
  i have never understood how some people feel they have the right to decide where you get to stick your genitals ... 
  great , another thread where 1/5th of the comments will all be from the same annoying aussie cunt . 
  honestly my southern brothers , i am a little disappointed in what you had to say about sweden . 
   sweden : imports garbage . 
  haha , fuck you sweden !, 
  :d i 'm really sorry denmark :(, 
  so you are saying , that the influx of people into this sub which hold fundamentally different political and cultural views from the original inhabitants of / r/europe , ruined it ?
