europe is a geographical term , it 's absolutely not a matter of opinion . 
  but i do and could go through the translation with you and show you just how precise it is . 
  you were ready to trust me to tell you what it says earlier , after all . 
  you are hilarious . 
  what nuance got lost in that particular translation ? 
  we 're not translating fine literature between two unrelated languages , but simple sentences and data point description between two closely related germanic languages . 
  you seriously have n't bothered to even look , have you ? 
  yes , it is . 
  have you never used a foreign language source and had to translate it ? 
  never written a thesis or a scientific paper ? 
  i 'm guessing the answer is no . 
  there is this magical site on the internet called `` google translate '' . 
  what you do is , you put in a link , click a button , and the site gets translated into english or any other language you might speak ( other people in the world speak different languages you see ! ), 
  here , let me show you : https://translate.google.no/translate?hl=no?sl=auto&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nito.no%2flonn-arbeidsliv-lonnskalkulator%2f%3fs%3d-1%26sg%3d0%2c200%26r%3d40000416%26g%3d0%26ys%3d i 'm not sure who the candidate for the imbecile is here ... 
  oh i thought i was dealing with someone who reads provided sources . 
  my bad . 
  what study ? 
  i linked the engineering union 's live data . 
  that is it . 
  i am not even sure why you wrote all the rest . 
  i just said that gender gap exists within a profession . 
  that is it . 
  the source simply shows that the choice of different professions is not the cause for the gender gap . 
  i do not know how you would even measure ambition , but hours worked are indeed taken into account since these are statistics for full-time employees and the amount of hours they are allowed to work is regulated by norwegian laws . 
  looking at the statistics for engineering salaries here oslo for example , men earn on average 678 864 kr per year , while women only earn 579 444 kr per year .

  reddit loves this myth , though . 
  i 've had two major hospital visits , appendectomy and birth with complications requiring a hospital stay . 
  none of the staff was filipino . 
  the nationalities i do recall were danish , swedish , norwegian , croatian and russian . 
  i left the country for uni and stayed abroad , so i only know through facebook . 
  it 's been 12 years . 
  the person i feel happiest for is the super smart , kind and humble girl who was never one of the popular ones , who went on to university studying economics , but then founded a company with her husband turning one of her hobbies into a business . 
  that 's true success to me !, 
  i always thought she was very smart and capable , so not unexpected . 
  another girl was stunningly beautiful , went on to win a local fitness pageant and became a minor celebrity . 
  then got cancer and died at 28 . 
  that bit was very sad and unexpected . 
  :( nobody else i can think of honestly . 
  mostly people seem to be doing average or worse than i expected . 
  such is life . 
  going on 6 years here , 2 shared properties and one ( planned ) child . 
  we are technically engaged , but getting married costs money , time and planning energy so we just have n't prioritized it . 
  plus , here in norway having a child with someone you live with ( samboer ) gives you certain extra rights such as inheritance , so it 's already very close to marriage . 
  norway sounds same as austria , i.e. 
  midwives run the show and doctors are on stand-by for complications and to do stuff like administer epidural if requested . 
  my own delivery required vacuum assist and had several more complications so there were several doctors present . 
  i was educated in czech republic in the 90s and we used exactly this !,

  i 'm a native czech speaker . 
  the flag is because i live in norway . 
  i 'm telling you , you 're wrong . 
   bohemia ( region ) and czechia ( country ) are the same word in czech er ... no it is n't . 
  reading the rest of your comments , it seems you just make things up as you go . 
  it 's interesting that sports is the only thing you mention as filling up ones free time . 
  i took language classes , art classes , pottery classes and played an instrument . 
  and even those had to be dropped my final year to prepare for the final exam . 
  estonia is like that girl who is dating one of the guys in the friend group , but is n't really considered part of the gang . 
  scotland is the cool dude that sometimes drops by and everyone wishes he would move out of his mom 's and hang out more . 
  his mom is getting a little crazy lately though , so he might just do that at some point . 
  i mean i love living here , but there is nothing touristy worth seeing here . 
  if you 're going to norway , go to the west coast to see the awesome fjords , see awesome island towns like \u00c5lesund , visit the national parks , see the mountains , travel north to lofoten etc. 
  why come here just to see a flat coastal city with just the same caf\u00e9s and museums as most other major cities in europe ? 
  threatening to cause war over flags ? 
  words like war are fun to throw around when you do n't have any intention of picking up a weapon and going into harm 's way yourself , huh ? 
  * twitch * that 's the icelandic flag ... 
  knitting . 
  there was even a [ slow tv show ] ( https://tv.nrk.no/serie/nasjonal-strikkekveld/dvnr30004013/01-11-2013 ) about it . 
  if you have spare 4 hours and love knitting , here 's a show for you !, 
  ( and if you still want more , there is an 8 hour sequel ! ), 
  the downside , of course , is that software dev salaries are much lower than in north america . 
  it 's not a `` get rich '' profession around here , more like `` live comfortable middle class '' . 
  i work in software development . 
  it can be a little stressful when deadlines are near and things break , but 99 % of time it 's relaxed . 
  definitely work to live . 
  work stays at work , nobody is expected to stay longer than standard 8 hours ( and if you do , the time counts to your flexible hours pool so you can work a shorter day another time ) , and never work on weekends . 
  it goes to collections . 
  like every other normal bill that you do n't pay . 
  it 's not offensive , it 's not exactly a secret how many norwegian/swedish/danish speakers there are . 
  tuition is free for everyone in norway . 
  the barrier for entry is language and very high living costs . 
  yes , though you need both a and b. 
  yes , that is true , i was just chiming in on how universities can drastically reduce the amount of foreign students by just putting up language proficiency as a barrier for entry . 
  if you make the official language of instruction danish and have danish language proficiency as an acceptance requirement then it does n't matter how many lectures are in english , you just wo n't get accepted into the course without speaking fluent danish . 
  this is how norway does it for most of bachelors degrees ( with norwegian , of course ) . 
  my parents are of different nationalities and married happily for over 30 years , so no , never struck me as an issue . 
  i 've never dated anyone with the same nationality ( ies ) as me , either . 
   and i did n't even know for sure until we got a dna test ... still do n't fully know that 's because nationality is not genetic . 
  you share 99.9 % of your dna with other humans , and of the remaining 0.1 % you will once again share a large portion with people who migrated out of africa at the same time as your ancestors . 
  so a ridiculously small fraction of your dna will point to a very general region which does not even pinpoint area small enough to point to a single european nation state . 
  nah , what am i saying , i 'm sure you 're genetically 1/16th italian . 
  oh yes almost forgot about those !, 
  as a little girl i much preferred the cartoons with girl characters , though . 
  yes , here in norway it 's very popular too !, 
  it was actually one of the most surprising things when i first came to norway . 
  i spent most of my childhood in czech republic , so for me it would be : * [ k\u00e1\u0165a a \u0160kub\u00e1nek ] ( https://www.veselepohadky.cz/assets/nahlady-kategorie/138/social/pohadka-kata-a-skubanek.jpg ) ( about `` katya '' and her dog ) * [ maxipes f\u00edk ] ( http://img.ceskatelevize.cz/program/porady/870994/foto09/01.jpg?1314369932 ) ( once again about a girl and her dog `` feek '' , but this time a huge dog ) * [ d\u00e1\u0161e\u0148ka ] ( http://img.ceskatelevize.cz/program/porady/898431/foto09/02.jpg?1065084840 ) ( it 's about a puppy growing up ; i actually never realized how many of these were about dogs ) * [ mach a \u0160ebestov\u00e1 ] ( http://files.skolka-vk.webnode.cz/200001533-5d1175e0cd/mach%20a%20%c5%a1ebestov%c3%a1.jpg ) ( two friends who go on adventures using their magic telephone headset ) * [ \u017dofka a spol .

  this is correct . 
  it would be seen as pretty racist to keep records of what skin color people have . 
  the word `` clothes '' .
