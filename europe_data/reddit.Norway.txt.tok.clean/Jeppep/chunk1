i think you need to read up on your old history lessons about kalmar , because it was not what you seem to think it was . 
  ... or sweden ... or norway, 
  but , but think about all the welfare !, 
  too bad you 're not any good at speaking danish though . 
  is welfare a language too ? 
  i 'd like to count that . 
  i know a swede . 
  he just speaks silly . 
  you were talking about population . 
  to support a larger population you historically need a lot of agriculture . 
  norway has always lacked that for obvious reason . 
  41 % of austria is agricultural land , norway has just over 3 % 17 % of austria is arable land , in norway it 's just under 3 % just under 25 % of norway is above the arctic circle , how much of austria is above the arctic circle ? 
  right 0 % zilch , zip , nada . 
  i do n't think it was such a bad argument after , reacting to your statement norway has `` barely any population '' . 
  it 's all relative . 
  well , that 's the truth . 
  i guess its the same for people from copenhagen . 
  i 've often been mistaken for being swedish over there , and people are really quick at switching to english when they hear i speak norwegian and not danish . 
  and i am from grimstad where the norwegian is even more like danish . 
  hmm , i do n't know about his mother , but his father is a prominent norwegian actor nils ole oftebro . 
  he does take some of his looks . 
  wow , that 's impressive !, 
  never would have thought he could speak it that well . 
  my impression is that people from oslo have a hard time with the danish language . 
  wonder where he picked it up ? 
  edit : found out from reading his wiki that amongst norwegian theater schools that he also studied in copenhagen , so that explains that . 
  jakob oftebro speaking danish ? 
  that should be interesting . 
  fyi : oslo is pretty dead in the summer . 
  most norwegians leave the city to visit other places , mostly domestic , but also abroad . 
  so there is a huge difference between summer oslo and rest of the year oslo . 
  i can highly recommend massimo dutti for not too pricey , but quality clothing that looks great . 
  well ... iceland is also a nordic country . 
  someone did n't read their history . 
  you never gave us freedom , you lost us to sweden after the napoleonic wars . 
  we declared our own freedom , from sweden . 
  a bit of lube is never a bad thing for lovemaking, 
  guys , ca n't we all just be friends ? 
  love , norway, 
  i really do n't think norwegians have a grudge . 
  it 's not like we have a grudge against germans anymore either, 
  bybanen is nice but it would generally not go under the definition of being a tram , but a light rail . 
  we need some new trams in oslo !, 
  i 'm working on that building now \u263a, 
  i really like that building . 
  the finnish buses look like they are high on something . 
  i am sure the nazis would yes . 
  by - og regionsplanlegging at umb , now nmbu in \u00c5s akershus , 30km from oslo . 
  you can also study at uis i believe , but i 'm not sure if they have the gis courses . 
  edit : i also did a semester abroad at umn minneapolis , studying urban design . 
  get your history straight . 
  that was a coordinated attack not only by the british , but also by french , polish and norwegian resistance forces . 
  shetland was sold to scotland by king christian i of norway/sweden/denmark , not conquered . 
  that was n't conquering , you were helping us out against the nazis . 
  i am a consultant in urban planning and design . 
  tons of natural resources up there though . 
  since when did uk/england conquer lands belonging to norway ? 
  easy . 
  it 's a map error . 
  the river tana separates the landmass . 
  i make lots of maps in my proffesion . 
  that 's part of norway , parts of the county of finnmark ( which btw , is larger than denmark ) . 
  looks like everything east of the river tana got screwed up . 
  there are three towns there : vads\u00f8 , vard\u00f8 and kirkenes . 
  that 's because the title is wrong . 
  should say `` in the eu '' . 
  i do n't know if you remember the real reason for norway joining nato , but it had something to do with wwii , if you remember how that went for us . 
  * - i 'll ^ show ^ myself ^ out . ^ . ^ . 
  phew, 
  til all the european countries love the netherlands . 
  good on you guys !, 
  cause a whole country is to big for you eh , eh ? 
  what are the sizes of these holes ? 
  small bucket sized ones ? 
  i used to do this as a kid and i am now afraid that i am secretly german . 
  i think they were trying to be nice , but i appreciate your enthusiasm . 
  well is n't it illegal to go abroad to kill in norway ? 
  to fight for another country ? 
  if you do this then you should get deported if you return . 
  we 'll manage . 
  fyi : the literal translation of utopia is `` no place '' which is not a good thing . 
  eutopia on the other hand means `` good place '' . 
  * the term utopia was coined in greek by sir thomas more for his 1516 book utopia , describing a fictional island society in the atlantic ocean . 
  the word comes from the greek : \u03bf\u1f50 ( `` not '' ) and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ( `` place '' ) and means `` no place '' . 
  [ 1 ] the english homophone eutopia , derived from the greek \u03b5\u1f56 ( `` good '' or `` well '' ) and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ( `` place '' ) , means `` good place '' . 
  this , because of the identical pronunciation of `` utopia '' and `` eutopia '' , gives rise to a double meaning . 
  ca n't we all just be friends ? 
  well only if welsh people shag sheep because of their english dialect . 
  norwegians shag moose . 
  right on the money . 
  norwegian and i speak and write american english . 
  not bad . 
  g3 , mp5 , grenades , rocket launcher , mg , glock tons of fun . 
  i was in the kings guard in the urban warfare unit . 
  i remember hating my service , like being on mg duty outside when it was -37 c , but i also remember a lot of great times . 
  all in all i enjoyed my service and would have done it again . 
  if 5 million danes migrated to norway i 'm sure they would get the political power to change the taxes on beer . 
  that would be nice . 
  we can all eat * panert r\u00f8dspette med remoulade * and drink beer together . 
  yes , you can say a danish person or a person of danish descent , but not `` a german and a danish '' like in your sentence .
