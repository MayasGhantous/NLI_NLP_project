  i 'm not saying it 's not stupid hot . 
  but he was the one comparing 48c phoenix to 42c portugal . 
  portugal is coastal and can get pretty humid . 
  i bet phoenix only started growing after the invention of the ac, 
  i 've been on the south coast of norway . 
  20-25 degrees and sunny for over a week now . 
  loving it . 
  need to get in the water again soon . 
  good luck with that . 
  ask russia what it was like last time, 
  0 % humidity though . 
  easy to bicycle everywhere too ? 
  i 'm quite aware of the eea situation , but thanks for explaining it in here for people . 
  i was just trying to point out that people in this thread are very specific on the implementation amongst the eu countries . 
  but we have had it already for some time in norway . 
  already had it for a month or two in norway . 
  how can it be that a non eu country gets free eu roaming first ? 
  or in the mountains here . 
  we have free roaming in the eu in norway . 
  what . 
  we have free eu roaming in norway . 
  and we 're not in the eu . 
  get your shit together denmark . 
  are these considered newspapers . 
  sure it 's not tabloids ? 
  ahhh , had to rewatch it . 
  i found his dialect a bit hard to understand too . 
  it 's been a long time since i have been trolled this hard . 
  well done . 
  if you take away krill and fishes then the whales do n't have any food . 
  stop playing stupid . 
  do n't tell them that , germany will ask us for the ring !, 
  pretty much every country in the world `` ca n't seem to stop '' polluting and driving most of the natural world to extinction . 
  that includes removing biomass like small fishes and krill from the oceans , killing a lot more whales and sea life than norway every will be able to do by `` whaling '' . 
  get down from your high horse . 
  this is funny , but what does it have to do with norway ? 
  is this some meme thing you germans are spreading at the moment ? 
  you 've never heard of diversification ? 
  a country ca n't ( or rather should n't ) live off just a few incomes . 
  that goes for your private economy too . 
  you might want to think about that . 
  oil fund, 
  through the nazi lines, 
  why did the us make comic sans ? 
  nope , norway is the happiest : http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/20/travel/worlds-happiest-countries-united-nations-2017/ suck it !, 
  weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  where do you guys live !, 
  keep your rain westerners !, 
  25 reporting in !, 
  i have never experienced -40 , that 's insane . 
  it means to fuck in norwegian, 
   plus the beer they sell in their pubs and stores is very weak for some reason . 
  says the guy who drinks folk\u00f6l . 
  dust, 
  hipp hipp , hurra hurra hurra !, 
  in norway you do n't rent . 
  you buy . 
  who the hell brings their king along to attack a fortress anyways ? 
  you guys have obviously never played chess . 
  as soon as we have bohuslen , \u00f8st-tr\u00f8ndelag ( herjedalen og jemtland ) back and you shoot your own king again , we can talk about what is what . 
  user * rospaya * created that list as a direct response to the eu member countries list . 
  it 's just a point i have to keep making over and over , and it is getting sort of old , think of it as a demographic problem : let 's say if i were to create a post in / r/norway , but only include information regarding norways ethnic ( white ) population . 
  it would by far be the largest demographic , but you would leave out hundreds of thousands of other norwegians . 
  they might not protest much , but it gets old after a while and you get tired of having to remind people about including everyone in a discussion . 
  - did that make it clearer for you ? 
  so ... the british sent their prisoners to australia , and australia sends some of their prisoners to nauru ? 
  nice, 
  appreciate it bro , do n't know how many times i have to say this my self around here . 
  also , this is n't about being anti-eu ( i am pro ) , but when you are in a certain sub-reddit , one should speak to all it 's users not just the largest group . 
  speak for yourself eu . 
  have an up-boat `` s\u00f6ta bror '' . 
   + a horrible language have an up-boat friend , 
  and ... on a different note : there is a penis in the top right corner . 
  lol yours truly , norway, 
  norway : about 3 500\u00a0000\u00a0000 norwegian kroner = 473.076093 million euros in 2011 , more per capita then italy or france , according to our largest newspaper : [ source ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=no&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.aftenposten.no%2fnyheter%2firiks%2fpolitikk%2fnordmenn-betaler-mer-til-eu-enn-franskmenn-og-italienere-6747386.html&amp;act=url ) those figures do not take into consideration our payments towards eu/norway military co-operations . 
  snow in slovenia , no snow in oslo norway . 
  2012 , * world is gon na end * ... 
  scandinavian broadband . 
  you jelly ? 
  i like how after his speech last year , several schools across the country used it as a warning to norwegian school children , to show them what could happen if you didnt take english class seriously . 
  yes , cause denmark is blazing hot in comparison !, 
  the space , feels good man !, 
  :( thread title confused me then , `` happy european day of languages '' , and then `` an eu with only one language would be a catastrophe '' ... - come on guys , there is more to europe than eu . 
  sincerely norway ; we got your oil and gas bitches . 
  we do n't steal !, 
  ... do we ? 
   no one gives a fuck about the uk . 
  ... wtf dude ? 
  where are your manners ? 
  also do you think your comment helps this thread in anyway , except for just spreading hate ? 
   we will kick all your asses once the *** snow *** is here !, 
   yes , 8th [ 1 ] ? 
  anything to add ? 
  - why yes i do : pretty sure there is more to winter olympics ( etc. ), 
  than just alpine skiing . 
  also [ skiing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skiing ) originated in scandinavia . 
  * cough *, 
  depends on the university actually , i pay ~ 46 eur per semester . 
  thanks , but i live 40 minutes from the swedish border , so acquiring cheap snus is n't a problem , 
  oh yes .
