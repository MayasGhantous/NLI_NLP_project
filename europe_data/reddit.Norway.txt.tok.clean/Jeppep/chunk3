  the oslo-fjord really stands out in size compared to the rest of the nordics .

  ** crises and growth , 1914-1945 ** officially norway was neutral during world war i. 
  however , in terms of the economy , the government clearly took the side of the british and their allies . 
  through several treaties norway gave privileges to the allied powers , which protected the norwegian merchant fleet . 
  during the war 's first years , norwegian ship owners profited from the war , and the economy boomed . 
  from 1917 , when germany declared war against non-friendly vessels , norway took heavy losses . 
  a recession replaced the boom . 
  norway suspended gold redemption in august 1914 , and due to inflationary monetary policy during the war and in the first couple of years afterward , demand was very high . 
  when the war came to an end this excess demand was met by a positive shift in supply . 
  thus , norway , like other western countries experienced a significant boom in the economy from the spring of 1919 to the early autumn 1920 . 
  the boom was followed by high inflation , trade deficits , currency depreciation and an overheated economy . 
  the international postwar recession beginning in autumn 1920 , hit norway more severely than most other countries . 
  in 1921 gdp per capita fell by eleven percent , which was only exceeded by the united kingdom . 
  there are two major reasons for the devastating effect of the post-war recession . 
  in the first place , as a small open economy , norway was more sensitive to international recessions than most other countries . 
  this was in particular the case because the recession hit the country 's most important trading partners , the united kingdom and sweden , so hard . 
  secondly , the combination of strong and mostly pro-cyclical inflationary monetary policy from 1914 to 1920 and thereafter a hard deflationary policy made the crisis worse ( figure 3 ) .

  no we were n't poor . 
  norway was booming in the 1950s , before we discovered oil in the north sea . 
  [ http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/grytten.norway] ( http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/grytten.norway ) like many other countries between the early 1920s and 1939 our country was hit by two major financial crises . 
  i was surprised by troms\u00f8 too ( or the lack of it rather ) . 
  thank you for digging , 
  ah , who said germans do n't have a sense of humor . 
  that was excellent !, 
  just go on to google maps and see how much of our country is covered by woods , creeks , hills and mountains . 
  wolves come and go as they like . 
  quite the lovely chap i am sure . 
  psst , do n't tell anyone i said this , but you are ok in my book . 
  i like how you are n't against sweden being labelled `` like us , but boring '' , lol . 
  good on you neighbor !, 
  but ... there is nothing wrong with this map !, 
  the distinction lies between the nordics and northern europe . 
  the nordics are more than just scandinavia , but scandinavia is part of the nordics , and northern europe for that matter . 
  norwegians of course refers only to people from norway . 
  norden is norwegian for the nordics . 
  did that help at all ? 
  lol, 
  god i love living in oslo . 
  also , norway ( and probably oslo ) is the easiest place to get a one night stand in the world if i remember correctly . 
  my point exactly . 
  we even have cities in norway , if you translate `` by '' from norwegian to english as `` city '' ( which is common ) , with populations around 20k inhabitants . 
  there used to be a more rigid system about what a city was , but nowadays pretty much any administrative center can call it self a city in norway . 
  woa there buddy . 
  having lived in the us my self i am not talking down on them . 
  what gdp per capita are you looking at ? 
  both here : http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd and here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita - then we have about twice the gdp of the us . 
  if you look at ppp ( currency exchange rate ) , then it is more like you stated . 
  potatoes !, 
  vodka . 
  vodka happened . 
   however due to the extremely high gdp per capita of the us ... [ ] pfffff, 
  well , at the very least you can have our upboats dear friend . 
  different languages and states use the term city differently . 
  for example b\u00e6rum is a fairly densely populated county outside of oslo , and is considered part of metropolitan oslo . 
  more than 100 000 people live in the urban area of b\u00e6rum , but it is not considered a city . 
  sandvika which is the urban centre of b\u00e6rum has historically neither been considered a city . 
  - i am an urban planner, 
  well , not quite . 
  mission accomplished !, 
   but seriously , if a whole country all focuses their knowledge on playing the market no wonder they 're doing good . 
  well , of course * the whole country * does n't focus on this at all . 
  we focus on staying competitive and doing what we are good at . 
  although i am sure the guys we have working on the fund are top notch brokers , it 's still just a small fraction of what we are doing here in norway . 
  i am sure you guys have something similar in the us and it 's not like you guys * focus all your * knowledge on 1 thing . 
  ... keeping all your eggs in one basket ... and all that , 
  tell that to the us , uk , germany , sweden , or numerous other countries who have relied on immigration to grow and prosper . 
  norwegians have emigrated themselves when times were rough , do n't you forget that !, 
  it 's an investment fund , not a fund to be drained any time soon . 
  do you have any sources to back your claims ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.nbim.no/en/ ) page shows the size ( market value ) of the oil wealth fund live . 
  since it 's sunday it seems to have taken a day off . 
  watching this thing rise and fall in value ( millions or billions at any moment ) is terrifying to watch and quite humbling . 
  tells me how little my personal wealth contribution to my country is ... edit : sorry , wrong url , now changed to english language, 
   `` eu classifies 1 percent of swedes as ` poor ' '' - [ that 's because the other 10 % are working and living in norway . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zxdo4dl7su ), 
  that stuff ca n't even be horse meat !, 
  : / i know , having lived a few years in germany . 
  the whole `` germans did not get this joke '' was in context of how the brits are known for their humor , but the germans are n't . 
  got to love the british and their sense of humor . 
  - also , 5 germans did not get this joke :p edit : 8, 
  dammit , you were n't supposed to translate that !, 
  ahem , rest of europe ? 
  we are not exactly struggling here in norway . 
  kind of misleading title do n't you think ? 
  edit : why the down-votes ? 
  am i wrong ? 
   or does corruption in the northern countries look more elegant or something ? 
  please clarify , do you mean northern countries as north of you guys ( as in most of europe ) , or northern europe ? 
  i thought there would be enough jobs here in norway for the swedes ? 
  i also like how my home area on the south coast of norway is greener then the rest of europe . 
  this is the best one yet . 
  upboats from norway, 
  as someone who uses gis and has made a few maps before , i would like to upvote your comment/response more than just once . 
  or perhaps because this is a map showing the information on countries in eu not europe ...
