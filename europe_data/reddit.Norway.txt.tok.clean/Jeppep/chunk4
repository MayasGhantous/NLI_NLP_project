  well we are n't worst off in europe . 
  also , most norwegians ( or atleast half of us ) live in the `` sunny belt '' as shown on the map . 
  oslo + coastal eastern norway + s\u00f8rlandet ( agder cities ) . 
  the first thing i thought of when checking the map was the quote from asterix and obelix in britain : asterix : `` is it always this foggy in britain dear cousin ? '', 
  british cousin : '' only when it does n't rain . '', 
  well you could stop by oslo or stockholm ? 
  they both have more sun than copenhagen per year  oslo : lower taxes and higher wages then in denmark . 
  when winter comes just collect all your vacation and fly south for some time  or try the norwegian way : enjoy the winter !, 
   i pay 1600 $ for a driving license , wtf ?!, 
  cute . 
  we stand corrected by a greenlander , well cheers to you mate !, 
  i do n't think norway was ever regarded as a colony . 
  also this is europe . 
  everyone owned someone else at some point . 
  no reason to be scared , the russians love us . 
  right ? ... 
  is the love that i 've found ever since you 've been around, 
  one more reason to love you guys even more . 
  also i believe it is called ekofisk , 
  well at least you have himmelbjerget , bwahahahahahah, 
  i am sorry , i 'll check my sources better next time , 
  i am sure norway and sweden would be up there if we are talking per capita . 
  there are almost as many kebab stores as there are chinese restaurants ... 
  i guess it could have been `` daddy '' instead ? 
  i find it weird how we were never labelled as vikings , but rather rich , cold or rainy ... then again all those are true as well . 
  annoying norwegian reporting in . 
  nothing wrong here , except i 'd like to request all southern and central europeans to slightly angle their wind turbines towards north so we can have some pleasant weather ... pretty please !, 
  also , us nordics do n't freeze , we just go from slightly pale to blue . 
  oh hai there brother sweden , 
  oh , i wish they were in schengen !, 
  good old demnark !, 
  got ta love it !, 
  that explains it , 
  a few dialects use ut , but i am sure it is never really written , right ? 
  god jul !, 
  god jul !, 
  why , is n't that typical . 
  a rich_bastard complaining about taxes :p, 
  but ... what about minnesota nice ? 
   jul = christmas actually jul = yule, 
   [ ... ] nature and shit . 
  got ta love nature and shit . 
   worst : i 'd say the weather , but it actually has more pros than cons such as * keeping immigrants away . 
  i came here to say the same , lol . 
  everything else is * aok * i think, 
  well they started constructing the new oslo city hall in the 1930s , back then it was considered a pinnacle of modern design . 
  times change i guess , 
  that ... * ahem * `` lady '' is more machine than man . 
  le what ? 
  right , but i specified oslo , and we do n't get polar nights here . 
  funny , for me it 's the other way around . 
  the few times i have observed brits making coffee they have always used instant coffee , which to me is like the drink from hell , it 's an insult to coffee . 
  most of the coffee prepared by norwegians is filter-brewed or french press , and tastes quite good . 
  the usual exception being the watered out coffee you get when visiting old people or a cheap kiosk ... edit : to clarify , my experience has been with friends from england , experiences visiting parts of england , and from british students at my university . 
  all in all my overall understanding is that you do know your tea , but do n't know how to make a good cup of coffee on your own . 
  here is [ mine ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s5zpb.jpg?1 ) , from a few years back . 
  well i can only answer for my work place , mainly professors and service workers at the economics department at a university ( all employees , except for me and one other person , being between 40 and 80 yrs . 
  ) : from most frequent lunches i have seen are : - rye hard/crisp bread with cheese , `` open sandwich '' dark bread with ham/cheese/pork liver pat\u00e9 / salami , and a fruit ( apple/orange ) . 
  - baguettes with chicken or shrimps etc. 
  - salads , with some chicken or just feta and other greens . 
  ... and then coffee , loads of coffee !, 
  edit : added crisp bread, 
  agreed finland . 
  also sweden should get their shit together . 
  they are making us nordics look bad . 
  8 to 15:45 personally , but not during weekends , god no . 
  well , when you only get a maximum of 5-6 hours of sunlight per day ( oslo ) during winter ( which is long and cold ) , then a large amount of coffee helps , 
  working for the government , fuck yeah !, 
  edit :  rye bread with some kind of topping . 
  [ leverpostei ] ( http://lenabeatrice.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/leverpostei.jpg ), 
  wine and vodka are worlds apart though . 
  personally i prefer to put the whole vodka in the freezer until it has that weird sort of semi-fluid state . 
  you and me denmark : [ leverpostei ] ( http://lenabeatrice.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/leverpostei.jpg ), 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wcmgs.jpg?1 ) is how coffee drinking is done in the [ nordics . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_coffee_consumption_per_capita ), 
   [ ] ... and wiping my ass with coins ( really tough ... ) . 
  man ... you just gave me the worst mental images !, 
   not super common though , mostly at \u00d6stermalm / stureplan . 
  i thought people on stureplan sprayed champagne on other people as a greeting ? 
  did n't you just say 29 % ? 
  that would be closer to between 1/3 and 1/4 no ? 
  also : need more coffee, 
  advice : do n't look at bmi for health reasons , or reasons to exercise . 
  - look at yourself in the mirror instead , or talk to a doctor ( run some tests ) . 
  but the ground rule is : if you think you should get checked or that you might need the exercise , then you probably do !, 
  we did  well actually the nobel committee is to `` blame '' for this , but personally i like those eu guys , they are a fun bunch . 
  ** cake day , woooohooooooo !, 
  ** edit : added the letter h, 
  same in norway with oslo . 
  i 'll have to disagree , oslo with 1.45 million people in it 's metropolitan area has 35 % of the population of norway . 
   sometimes it 's appropriate to give a quick kiss on the cheek while going in for a hug . 
   seriously i 'm surprised the ec has n't standardised greetings in ~ ~ europe ~ ~ the eu long ago . 
  edit : why am i being downvoted ? 
  the ec is mostly concerned with the eu , not all of europe . 
  go check their site/documents/about etc. 
  norway ( south coast ) : - strangers : handshake - relatives : hug/kiss/handshake - friends : hug/handshake - busines partners : handshake - men + women : handshake - women + women : handshake - men + men : handshake - how many kisses ? 
  : 1 - cheek , mouth , air , hand ? 
  cheek - after how much time of not seeing each other ? 
  a day , i guess . 
  - if not kiss , what then ?
