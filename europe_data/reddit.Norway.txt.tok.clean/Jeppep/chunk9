  it 's just not a very clear and concise spoken language . 
  looks like we borrowed some of them clouds today . 
  stop sending them our way dammit !, 
  i think you mean your ass sucked after having taco bell food . 
  well your gene pool is , well challenging , so i think you should keep them . 
  call us if ireland starts acting up again . 
  i think we can spare a few ships . 
  swede confirmed . 
  we could give you some fish ? 
  or maybe a rotten shark ? 
  has fucked . 
  edit : it 's the past tense of pule ( to fuck ) . 
  pula in norwegian is ... something quite different, 
  can i come and visit ? 
  this goes for all of gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka . 
  they do n't give a damn about sundays . 
  you mean the other way around right ? 
  looks like average of scandinavia is that 74 % of people agreed that `` generally speaking , most people can be trusted '' . 
  in the netherlands it 's closer to 63 % agreed and greece 17 % . 
  this is basically a statistics of corruption , which is extremely low in scandinavia . 
  but , we 're still friends , right uk ? 
  we call europe the continent in norway too . 
  i so want to visit malta . 
  looks amazing !, 
  sunshine does n't necessarily equal warm . 
  take chicago or minneapolis . 
  easy -20 to -30 c in winter , but sunny . 
  at the same time it can be rainy and 5 c in stavanger norway . 
  i lived in minneapolis . 
  i know what the deal is . 
  that place gets seriously cold in winter . 
  you poor poor fuckers . 
  greetings from norway . 
  hahahahahahaha, 
  when you have been in \u00c5lesund , take a day trip south with the ferry from solav\u00e5gen to fest\u00f8ya . 
  the landscape is insane . 
  [ hj\u00f8rundfjorden ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=hj%c3%b8rundfjorden&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjdoro98pjoahxpnpokhcsxbakq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1107&amp;bih=981 ), 
  ok , but most places in europe and especially the world are not nearly wet enough to facilitate jungle . 
  we do have temperate rainforests in western norway but even those are n't necessarily jungles . 
  so you would have to manipulate climates massively world wide . 
  in the end the world would n't be natural , it would be totally man made jungle , and you would probably kill off most species we know off . 
  not to speak of corals who are very sensitive to changes in ocean temperatures . 
   ~ ~ europe 's ~ ~ land cover from 1900 to 2010 shows forests are growing * eu, 
  because it 's made for eu not europe . 
  op fucked up . 
   as an urban designer my dream is to have hyper connected and ecologically self-sufficient megacities surrounded with ** jungle ** . 
  in europe ? 
   this really makes ~ ~ northern europe ~ ~ look like the hulk 's flaccid dick ( and balls ) * sweden and finland . 
  do n't involve us in that flaccid dick thing they have going on please . 
  thanks for leaving us hanging at the end there op . 
  now we 'll never know what it looked like finished . 
  haha , you ended up in probably the most british part of norway ( weather wise ) . 
  norway is boring ? 
  england is boring . 
  all rain . 
  ca n't ski anywhere . 
  no blond chicks in bikinis on the beach in london . 
  that 's changing and we need to start somewhere . 
  ca n't just continue like we have been . 
  wait what , we are going into a recession ? 
  which is common in most countries is it not ? 
  try putting a potato in your mouth and fake the hell out of the swedish you know . 
  you now speak danish . 
  also it might help being slightly drunk . 
  wait so czech is a funny version of croatian ? 
  weeeell ... 
  if skandinaviska means us speaking a bit slower ... 
  throwing in some norwegian/swedish/danish and sometimes english words then yes . 
  ooooo edgy, 
  all i could get was : multo bene , si ... no cosa ... santo cazzo madre di cristo vaffanculo !, 
  mangia merda vai a farti fottere but i 'm only norwegian so what do i know . 
  proper transit would help too . 
  norway and sweden have much more in common than norway and denmark . 
  i think most norwegians today are more fond of swedes than danes . 
  and that 's saying a lot coming from me because i 'm half danish . 
  woa woa there no need to get nasty . 
  it 's obviously something that would stand out to me as one of our national anthems sing about norway in red white and blue . 
  norway is red , white and blue . 
  would n't you say iceland is blue , white and red ? 
  half asleep . 
  we are idiot racists . 
  is that better or worse ? 
   their clothing is red so you ca n't where it spilled . 
  my kinda science !, 
  they have other sectors ? 
  dude , wth ? 
  spray can/aerosol can, 
  sir nils olav of the king 's guard  he 's scottish though . 
  i was thinking about bouvet\u00f8ya ,, 
  depending on what decade you 're talking about : shipping ( huge commercial fleet ) fishing wood/cellulose industry minerals aluminum ( hydro means cheap electricity ) local industry was large ( more self sufficient ) list goes on . 
  [ cute ] ( https://data.desustorage.org/int/image/1445/04/1445049712791.jpg ), 
  true we also have tons of penguins !, 
  yes it is . 
  well unless you consider denmark poor too . 
  norway was well off and became rich . 
  i find it offensive to our ancestors and lacking historical knowledge to say say otherwise .
