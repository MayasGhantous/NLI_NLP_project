but , where 's the fun in that ? 
  and how do they make this money ? 
  from other romas trawling around europe begging/stealing . 
  dubbing is horrendous . 
  you are losing part of the performance , part of the jokes , every single time . 
  while i agree with your premise , it 's not because of their history and culture . 
  it 's because anyone who opposes the government is arrested and silenced . 
   what 's surprising is the almost complete lack of violence on the police side . 
  well yes . 
  except for deploying snipers . 
  and ensuring that the police were given aks with real ammo . 
  which is more than pretty much any other leader in europe ( excluding putin ) would be willing to do . 
  why do you think this plan being unconfirmed matters so much ? 
  it 's pretty blatantly his only next step , after already deploying snipers and policemen with aks . 
  and why do they not have a mandate to rule there ? 
  the us fits into that , as geopolitically they 've created a precedent for assisting those who are victims to russia 's proxy-wars . 
  if the us and eu is not willing to assist , russia will slowly gobble up the entirety of eastern europe via bribes and corruption . 
  they all have a responsibility to keep eachother in check . 
  it 's been a russia vs the people of ukraine/eu-issue since the beginning . 
  the sami part of this map is wrong . 
  their borders would be further north . 
  yeah , your country is fucked too . 
  but , that 's mainly because of the electoral system you employ . 
  nah , it 's what happens when people vote 100 % out of selfish reasons . 
  that 's far easier for them with individual cases than when selecting a party . 
  people like you are why direct democracy is a terrible idea !, 
  it will , in the polls . 
  when will you dumbfucks understand that polls are meaningless unless the full data is released ? 
   dude i do n't get you though . . 
  so this reform was an abomination - and we agree on this - but why do you think it was the only way to get the economy in better shape ? 
  i mean it as a honest question . 
  i do n't think it would get ** better ** . 
  i think it would keep the disaster that 's been created from imploding ** now ** instead leaving the ramifications for later . 
  think of it like how the us handled the banking crisis in 2008 . 
  none of the issues were solved , they were patched over . 
  there 'll be another similar breakdown/economic crisis again , probably within this decade . 
  is it good for italy that you 're dealing with the massive economic issues that renzi ( and berlusconi , monti and letta . 
  renzi is n't alone in his guilt ) has created ? 
  yes . 
  is it good for the eu , which is already in a * very * rough period economically ? 
  definitely not . 
  depending on how quick we see the ramifications from this , it could be the final push needed for le pen to win . 
   also yeah , the swedish politicians are n't being smart about how to handle the sd but i have good faith in the swedes . . you 're norwegian so you 'll get me when i say they ca n't be that swedish , can they ? 
  :-p hahah , i get that joke for sure . 
  i 'm entirely confident that sd will win . 
  not because sweden is filled with racists , but because there are some enormous issues with their current immigration . 
  a lot of the immigrants are n't even remotely integrated and are primarily forming gettho-like subcultures instead of being a part of the swedish society . 
  those issues are 100 % ignored by the government and by the media . 
  ask the police/security guards in sweden , to find out how the average person will wind up viewing their situation . 
  if the government just acknowledged that there are massive issues and worked on solving them , they could still win . 
  right now they are just pretending that everything is fine , which is a certain way of dooming themselves . 
  do n't worry about the downvotes . 
  my opinions tend to be a bit controversial . 
  people will downvote and shove away things they do n't like . 
  it 's human nature . 
  unfortunately , i think i 've got a far better read on the current political reality than they do . 
  for me , brexit and trump did n't come out of nowhere . 
  it was blatantly obvious it was going to happen . 
  it will continue to happen across europe , until the left opens its eyes and gets it shit together . 
   have you even read the text of the reform ? 
  apart from the fact that renzi put us in even more debt than before , having a non-elected senate and a disproportionate representation of the leading party in the parliament is n't a progressive reform towards a streamlined economy . . 
  it 's just opening the door to a even more corrupted system . 
  sorry , but i grew up in this country and i fucking know how things work over here , as 60 % of my compatriots . 
  oh yes , i 've read it and i thought it was a fucking abomination . 
  i 'm not at all suggesting that passing it would have been a good idea . 
  i 'm simply pointing out that renzi 's chickens are now going to come home to roots , and it will not a particularily pretty afair for the italian economy , nor the eu as a whole . 
   i think we made it bloody clear that it 's a ) enough of foreign governments having a say in our internal policies and b ) we 're not accepting giving up perfect bicameralism simply because our political class is not to be trusted . 
  only the stupid could accept such a reform if they read the text and this is why the media made everything seem like a vote on the prime minister 's work rather than what it actually was : changing the constitution to make this country less democratic . 
  just imagine if a guy like salvini won the elections in the next term if the yes won !, 
  wtf ?!, 
  it would be like the fucking swedish democrats getting 54 % of the votes in sweden !, 
  well , that is what your elected government wants . 
  sadly . 
  and it 's also the only way your economy can come unhurt out of the current turbulent period without having a recession . 
  and sd will get 54 % of the votes . 
  maybe more . 
  it 's going to be a fucking landslide . 
  the government is literally just shutting down all dissenting voices amongst the people . 
  not going to work out very well for them . 
  this referendurum was the defining piece of legislation for your economy for the next decade . 
  if you think it has nothing to do with economy , you are seriously misinformed . 
  wait and see . 
  the current budget + economy ca n't handle the amount of refugees you 've taken in . 
  if nothing changes italy will go full greece within only a couple of years . 
  you are on the brink of a financial crisis right now and a single wrong step will be disastrous . 
  it is extremely relevant . 
  now the italians will be unable to keep the refugee costs and other debts going and will have to start cutting costs across the board + asking for more money from the eu . 
  germany are n't going to carry a heavier load than atm , so the responsibility will fall to france . 
  with their election so close and le pen pushing for frexit they ca n't really take on any more of the eu costs . 
  that leaves italy in a very , very bad position and the eu itself hanging by a thread . 
  their economic woes are about to be ramped up to ten , just wait and see . 
  if this happens and they ca n't find a mutually beneficial deal with the uk , the french will elect la pen and pull out , which would be the end for the eu . 
  the french simply wo n't accept bearing a bigger burden than they do today . 
  ofc , a lot of this depends on the italian referendum . 
  they 're already against the truth . 
  in fact they 're directly opposed to it . 
  saudia arabia created isis with us funds and weapons ( and they had knowledge of that before giving them the bloody weapons ) . 
  until that is a newsheadline in every major paper in the eu and officially condemned by all the national leaders in a public forum , anything say on isis is purely propaganda and lies . 
  nah , it 's going to be the other way around . 
  depending in the italian vote , britain 's money could literally be the only way the eu does n't break up within the next half a decade .
