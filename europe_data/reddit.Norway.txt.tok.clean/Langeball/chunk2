  [ butt stuff ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=butt+stuff ), 
  ugliest and most boring city eu, 
  speaking of which ... 
  [ asker ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asker ) , stronghold of the baglers who were fighting the birkebeiners in a viking civil war . 
  sure , but that 's a separate thing . 
  we 're talking about an obesity crisis , not a muscle loss crisis . 
  yes, 
  that 's the idea , to lose , not gain . 
  do n't need to work out at all . 
  just eat less , no snacks . 
  i 've often seen eu+n orway in news headlines , makes me feel like a special snowflake . 
  why did you google it ? 
  that moment when your country is large , but you still do n't see the building . 
  [ w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bhprk2neja ), 
  should n't the judge be wearing armour too ? 
  do n't mistreat your kids . 
  or else we take your children away . 
  does n't sound so bad does it ? 
  no organization is flawless . 
  but these accusations go above and beyond . 
  they 're being accused of xenophobia , kidnapping , being worse than the nazis etc. 
  people hear one side of the story and because cps ca n't defend themselves , the accusers must be telling the truth right ? 
  put down your pitchforks people ... norwegians are not evil . 
  you would think that , considering your obvious bias against norwegians . 
  if the father was proven to be the one abusing , the child would not have been given to him . 
  and it depends on the norwegian definition yes , which is what you go by when you move to our country . 
  if a child is born or has spent the majority of their life in norway it makes sense to give it to the norwegian parent , instead of the other parent who 's taking the child to `` their real home '' in eastern europe somewhere . 
  and just how many case do n't we hear of ever ? 
  raising kids born in norway as norwegians and keeping them away from unfit parents ? 
  too nazi for me . 
  wow they make it sound like we only go for lithuanians , but we eat all kinds of babies ... 
  the reason people care more about immigration is because it 's a growing problem , not because people are racist . 
  balkans were certainly red on my map ( \u0361 ~ \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  this is the speed in our walls and what we pay for . 
  i used speedtest to get those numbers . 
  nah , from the capital somewhere . 
  i live 25 minutes south of it . 
  no norway , so here 's [ my contribution . 
  ] ( http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n187/scullyy/future_zps482adc29.png ) ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  do you know a source for those numbers ? 
  phew . 
  ruining the boarding school look ? 
  [ what !? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj882qyzr-m ), 
  is a `` norway town '' grammatically ( ? ), 
  correct ? 
  should n't it be a `` norwegian town '' ? 
  i often see the former in english language newspapers , but never seen it regarding other countries . 
  no way . 
  south america voted against it for the most part , not for it . 
  stopped reading at `` the highways were perfectly maintained '' . 
  top kek, 
  yes ? 
  people think that portugal be real , but it do n't, 
  no need for innovation when we 're the best already . 
  i always look at estonia in maps like these , just to see if they can into nordic . 
  because of hozier ? 
  mount and blade warband and path of exile . 
  and so sweden drops from nr 1 spot on most powerful passports .

  i saw it at a friends house . 
  was in the forest somewhere and a big knife involved . 
  maybe his sons girlfriend is a scandinavian spy \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  what ? 
  is it bad ? 
  they 're your [ neighbours ] ( http://i.viaplay.com/scandi/viaplay_prod_-_scandi/361/776/1_landscape_ge__721617.jpg?width=840&amp;height=472 ) too, 
  you have americans on either side of you though , that is much worse ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  europes ? 
  `` being homeless is a choice , so i do n't feel sorry for you '' maybe ? 
  when i search norway + man , i get this before anders http://www.norwegiandating.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/6441-11021h05r222.jpg, 
  better question , why did they start reporting on iceland in the first place !, 
  it should be `` not eu '' i 'm guessing . 
  only if we get to push our values on the rest of the world, 
  what point are you trying to make there chief ? 
  sort of like the only thing your country is known for is shitting on palestinians, 
  fun fact , when you speak in absolutes the one exception will always come and correct you . 
  who did n't back then , but i remember reading something about vikings being more progressive in women rights than the rest of europe at the time, 
  obviously russia has to practice nuking sweden in case it joins nato , duh, 
  source ? 
  why are you expecting a different answer for the same scenario just with different countries ? 
  eu or europe ? 
  so the real targets look like control towers ? 
  indeed , time for the us to pull out and europe to go in . 
  you must have watched a fuckton of videos on norwegian comedians today to come to that conclusion . 
  you 're not wrong though, 
  do you have to be willing to let everyone in before you can say you support immigrants ? 
   `` i want to understand the feelings of refugees , washed overboard while crossing the mediterranean '' and so he decides to go to a water park ? 
  she was asked if she wanted to be rescued from the water , that 's it . 
  she said herself that it 's nothing like what the refugees go through . 
  silly and harmless fun . 
  but i guess if you 're a minister you got to be extra careful people do n't take it the wrong way, 
  you can never have justice in a case like this , the kids are dead and no amount of punishment is going to change that . 
   olyckligt would n't that be unhappy ? 
  maybe they ca n't see past the religious aspect of it, 
  best cardboard i 've ever tasted, 
  read the small print next to the blue square . 
  this entire map should be blue ... 
  eh , i 'm not really okay with it . 
  i will have to talk to them about it .
