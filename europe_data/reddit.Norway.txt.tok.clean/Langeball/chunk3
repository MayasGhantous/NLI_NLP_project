  i only found out their views recently . 
  should , yes . 
  i was n't talking about what 's normal in norwegian society , but what 's normal among muslims . 
  then you do n't understand the meaning of the word normal . 
  if the majority of someone does something , then it 's considered normal to do that thing . 
  it is not my opinion that it 's okay for muslims to be mysogynistic, 
   the chinese , indians , and caribbean migrants did n't have to abandon their culture and traditions to to live peacefully and happily in western societies . 
  true , but they are more compatible with our culture , holding many of the same values . 
  well obviously they 're not , which was my point . 
  they have n't been raised well . 
  yep , i should have called them out on their bullshit . 
  and i will if i hear them talk shit again, 
  and you 'd be right when speaking of westerners . 
  but i 'm not sure what 's normal for a muslim immigrant , maybe low opinions on women is widespread in which case he would be normal . 
  i do n't know enough muslims to tell if that 's normal or not . 
  i have some muslim friends who i absolutely get along with most of the time , but lets just say i avoid talking about women with them . 
  they are `` normal '' in every other regard , but they just have 0 respect for women . 
  in large part due to their parents raising them as if they were back in the old country . 
  put yourself in their shoes . 
  would you raise your child to treat women as shit , kill adulterers and infidels etc etc if you were forced to flee your home country and move to some shithole in the middle east ? 
  i sure as hell would n't , which is why we should n't let these people stay on a permanent basis . 
  they need to be in countries that have a similar culture . 
  nope . 
  i 'm saying they do n't have the same respect , or just common decency that the guests ( first generation ) have . 
  your host/guest analogy applies to first generation immigrants for sure , but not the second/third . 
  they were born here and are n't our guests , but our fellow citizens . 
  is it asterix ? 
  so do they want muslims to come over to russia ? 
  i doubt it . 
  so they 're trying to anger muslims and make them kill westerners ? 
  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/majority '' : the group or party that is the greater part of a large group '' does n't that mean you can use it in this case ? 
  yeah , belgium/brussels is a ticking bomb . 
  when you say it 's excellent , what are you comparing it to ? 
  european food ? 
  probably twitch chat , the dankest of places,

  this stereotype has very real roots and has very little to do with current eu/british relations . 
  you need to make a german language psa and have it air in germany : happy swedish family drives down a road and hits a moose , killing the mother in the front seat , horrified screaming children in the back and a devastated sobbing father . 
  then change scene to a couple of blissfully ignorant german backpackers laughing at the moose-crossing sign they had just stolen . 
  never heard of it, 
  usspna united states of some parts of north america . 
  difference being most of those countries have n't tried the law on lolicon, 
  i did n't realize that many countries had the same rule, 
  anyone know if this holds true for norway as well ? 
  i imagine it does ...

  we travel across the border to sweden to get it and it 's probably nowhere near the real thing though, 
  it might , if it upsets other members of the eu, 
  does n't heimur mean `` home '' ? 
  did they discover his motivation for stabbing that woman ? 
  because there 's a child raping culture in the middle east ? 
  if you think they 're doing it for selfless reasons . . 
  actually , they 're the smallest in the whole of europe !, 
  that 's because your houses are so fucking tiny, 
  i do n't think i 've ever gone swimming in a place with more than 40 people and not seen topless sunbathers . 
  though it 's been like 5 years since i last swam :o, 
  nothing wrong with wanting to save people , it 's when you throw away logic and reason to do it it becomes a problem . 
  that 's weird . 
  we 've been nr 1 on other similar lists , on this we 're 17th, 
  i 'd imagine to keep the refugees out , but a bit too late for that, 
  i remember we were higher before , nr 1 i think . 
  do n't know what happened over the past few years , but we 're dropping . 
  sadly the people most deserving of the award are never around to receive it :(,

  because men are better fighters than women generally speaking . 
  i was right on the money with the obesity shit , because i know that saying someone is overweight has very little meaning . 
  it does n't mean that they 're fat or anything , just not ideal weight .

  good luck to you, 
  blame = / = being open to the possibility that they did it themselves . 
  the two other comments are downvoted . 
  oh and it 's not the top comment for me , reddit is weird like that . 
  link ? 
  nah , i saw the posts before they were deleted . 
  i 'm not seeing anyone blaming immigrants for the fire , but rather pointing to them as the source of the malcontent . 
  do they teach you guys in school that these things never happened or do they just avoid the subject ? 
  i simply asked a question . 
  it 's a fact that innocent people are executed from time to time, 
  you 're ok with occasionally executing innocent people to satisfy your need for vengeance ? 
  what are you on about ? 
  where are these responses ? 
   when i recently asked one of the very few syrians i met in oslo why he had chosen norway , he said , `` i thought oslo was in sweden . '' :-d, 
  varg exists in norwegian too , though maybe he took the name from lotr ? 
  he was a big fan, 
  when can i expect the police ?
