  he won because hillary is scum and nobody really wanted her for president as much as they just did n't want trump . 
  dnc 's betrayal cost the democrats the election, 
  i do n't think anyone is going to attack nato because it would be suicide . 
  any aggressive country that may attack a nato member ? 
  the name is old , would it make you feel better if it was changed ? 
  nato is n't just defence against russia . . 
  personally i 'm a fan of people speaking their mind and not lying just because it 's `` what you 're supposed to do '' . 
  of course it 's normal . 
  it 's the reason why we live in huge countries instead of small tribes . 
  we 're supposed to keep expanding , but we 're regressing instead . 
  am this election could be trump , if hitlary shall go towards the eu army, 
  how do you mean ? 
  we did n't need pressure from us to sanction russia , they fucking invaded ukraine remember ? 
  hopefully that means we start defending ourselves and stop relying on usa . 
  why would you want to rely on a country that elected trump in the first place, 
  yes ? 
  someone has to work at that store . 
  thought this was / r/notinteresting for a sec . 
  what 's that other rule about exceptions ? 
  race segregation exists in rugby ? 
  where could these people be found before the internet happened ? 
  did they just not have an outlet for their racist , moronic views ? 
  because you are worst nordic, 
  norwegian dubbing in children movies is generally pretty excellent . 
  at least it was in the 90s , early 00s . 
  most of the songs sound better than the english versions imo . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcz85ssua1k https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wty4nf5kn4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g46mywclmg though it 's translated to sound the best which can lead to some really awkward lyrics at times : https://youtu.be/eovbwqdlchq?t=52, 
  it was disturbing visiting finland/sweden sub after the johaug incident , so much pent-up hatred against norway . 
  nah , one of the greatest crimes you can commit imo is executing innocent people , which is something that does happen in countries with the death penalty . 
  also criminals that are more likely to receive the death penalty if caught are less likely to surrender to the police and more likely to kill them in an attempt to escape `` justice '' . 
  that last part is something i imagine to be true anyway , i know i would value my own life over some random policeman . 
  living ? 
  more like surviving, 
  always assume ww2 references when speaking about germany, 
  might be harder to get a casual friend here , quality over quantity . 
  from what i hear that 's what they did , the woman chose to strip to avoid the fine, 
  not necessarily , it could be those people still think the ban is a good idea , there are after all a great deal of different people on reddit as opposed to one hive mind . 
  who was the norwegian , anyone know ? 
  edit : found this list : https://www.nrk.no/sport/tidligere-norske-dopingsaker-1.7218168 guessing it 's referring to tony hansen , losing the bronze for horse doping, 
  but she did n't have a break down keeping her from doing her job ? 
  i 'm not familiar with the situation , but i imagine she was crying while doing her job , which is perfectly fine . 
  i think you can agree you should n't be crying for a minute before you start doing your job , but rather wait until after you 've completed it, 
  yeah , because we europeans are so different from each other we ca n't possibly cooperate . 
  if you guys just give back jemtland and herjedalen everything will [ look as it should ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/sweden_1250_cropped.png/220px-sweden_1250_cropped.png ), 
  mfw norway wants to give finland a mountain and everyone will remember it as sweden giving away a mountain . 
  sorry finland , it 's just not worth it , sweden ruins everything again, 
  how is that relevant here ? 
  the source is the actual police, 
  because it is n't that important . 
  it 's important enough that we shut down some stores , but shutting down public transport etc would be too damaging, 
  i was wondering why he was browsing this forum so much , when he clearly dislikes europeans . 
  just looking for stuff to link on subreddits only he uses . 
  not sure why that one is there , but then again i just sit at my computer all day so i dunno, 
  http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/10/how-gangs-took-over-prisons/379330/ http://www.academia.edu/1116898/managing_prison_gangs_results_from_a_survey_of_u.s._prison_systems and [ most importantly ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/app/233450/discussions/0/541907867787216402/ ), 
  except innocent people are sometimes convicted and punishing an innocent person too harshly is unforgivable . 
  that 's what happens when prisons are privately owned and for profit , you do n't want a low recidivism rate because it means less slave labour . 
  and you think that 's related to your prison system working well ? 
  was there some kind of change 10 years ago to it that could lead to a drop in crime ? 
  or could it be the war on drugs cooling down a bit, 
  even if you 're not in a gang when you go to prison , you 'll be in one when you leave . 
  that ca n't be good for your recidivism rate, 
  the refugee part was hardly the core of the comment . 
  must be tiresome looking for racism in every thread, 
  nothing specific , i 'm just vaguely remembering a case or two where after being denied asylum the person went on to kill someone . 
  but then again i do n't know the motive , could just be anger . 
  anyway , that was n't the point of the comment , i 'll edit it out, 
  intuitively i want less crime and our justice system helps provide that . 
  if strongly punishing criminals helped with lowering crime and recidivism i 'd be all for it , but it does n't . 
  who cares what is being done if recidivism rates are going down ( and crime rates do n't go up of course , which they arent ) ? 
  that is all the matters . 
  should the need for revenge get in the way of a better society with less criminals in it ? 
  if our prisoners got to have sex with prostitutes once a week and it helped bring recidivism down 5 % , i 'm all for it . 
  ~ ~ i 've heard of two cases where some refugee ~ ~ even if a foreigner/refugee killed someone and the supposed motive was so they could remain in scandinavia , that would be a problem for immigration , not our prison system . 
  what makes no sense ? 
  and can leave at any time, 
  you guys lost iceland , made [ greenland kill itself ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suicide_in_greenland ) and failed to join our oil adventure . 
  please accept norwegian rule to rectify the situation, 
  we 're capped though 100/100 , who knows how many happinesses we have uncapped !, 
  thank god more people do n't go to church or this could have been much worse, 
  safe to assume no info on how many russian soldier have died so far ? 
  do n't worry , we 're not all bad at geography http://i.imgur.com/npx9ngr.png, 
  they would just claim he is a false christ , so you are right . 
  nice legs ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  could it be those are the opinions of two different people ? 
  macrumors.com kek, 
  basically that 's exactly what happened . 
  this was while i was in the army and i was supposed to be on guard duty , instead i was told to go back into the tent , which was heated to what felt like 100c . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_weather_records#lowest_temperatures_ever_recorded says -51 c for norway which is interesting because i 've experienced -45 c. 
   and the other one where it was made to believe that some civilians lynched a soldier is also a fake , they were actually carrying him to get help . 
  his own sister acknowledged that . 
  i can believe that one . 
  when i saw the video i got the impression they were helping someone , but then a redditor supposedly translated it and made it sound like they were beating someone up . 
  a little off topic , i 'm surprised how news stations did n't show the flightpath for erdogan live on tv . 
  i was watching him fly in circles and then it flew straight to istanbul and managed to land . 
  that 's when i knew it was over . 
  then 5 minutes later they start reporting on it on the tv . 
  but he has said he 's using democracy as a ladder right ? 
  he intends to become a proper dictator and is making/trying to make changes to the constitution ? 
  better he is stopped before he succeeds, 
  dude , you guys are starting the wars you 're dying in .
