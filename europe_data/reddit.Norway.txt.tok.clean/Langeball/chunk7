  he probably meant they are on average much more backwards than eastern europeans . 
  and he is right . 
  he was trying to point out how dumb your argument was , but okay . 
  personally i think we should respect our viking heritage and kill all christians . 
  see the problem with your line of arguing ? 
  i wonder if the average russian thinks it was it all worth it just so they could occupy crimea, 
  vagina piercings are that common ? 
  so that 's what tarja turunen says at the end of every live nightwish video on youtube . 
  what is this dragonsatan ? 
   k\u00f6nigsberg wants to be german     no it does n't . 
  they will if we just replace the russians there with germans, 
  sounds good, 
  i do n't understand why nobody here is reporting on this . 
  i guess they 're too busy trying to figure out why trumps choice of socks was a bad decision, 
  what happened romania ? 
  you 're not even russian dude, 
   what if someone wanted to be all naked . 
  i do n't see the problem, 
  one shadowbanned comment ? 
  a voting system the americans are responsible for having in the first place . 
  i took it the wrong way , fight me irl, 
  third , after norway and switzerland, 
  but who touches the head of the penis when peeing or puts their finger in the butthole when pooping ? 
  transferring bacteria to the penis makes a lot more sense , hands are dirty, 
  is bacteria living on the genitals any more harmful than other places on the body ? 
  i thought it was the toilet seat and toilet paper that was the source of the nastiness . 
  both those screenshots are from the movie, 
  about nato ? 
  main requirement is nordic flag tbh, 
  i believe the official term is `` twats '', 
  well that 's weird, 
  corruption is extremely damaging to a country though , just because it 's `` non violent '' does n't mean they should get released . 
  it 's a better alternative to releasing them, 
  ca n't one of your neighbours take some of them ? 
  i know we export prisoners to the netherlands because our prisons are full . 
  not even good picks . 
  how is `` considering burqa ban '' on the same level as `` prison slave labour for profit '' ? 
  if you google it you get very different numbers for denmark , so maybe map is wrong, 
  yeah , i do n't know why people are trying to make it seem like europeans are so different from each other , we absolutely are n't . 
  no , but since regular beer is so expensive i would hate to get addicted to something premium :p, 
  all that money saved by not liking the taste of beer feelsgoodman, 
  taxes, 
  and you 're worse off than the rest of us , coincidence ? 
  do the spanish pronounce it [ like this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/v/hilkvdnjt_o?start=1&amp;end=2 ), 
  open and shut case , johnson, 
  suicides are n't included in the op ... 
  how would you know , you 're not even subbed, 
  in that case you 're wood elves and [ we 're high elves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renewable_energy_in_the_european_union#/media/file:european-union-renewables-new.svg ), 
  map including more countries , but for 2013 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renewable_energy_in_the_european_union#/media/file:european-union-renewables-new.svg, 
  russia accused ukraine of being nazi , proceeded to invade them . 
  you said `` that was actually true though '' . 
  [ looks very christmasy to me ] ( http://www.ontariowildflower.com/images/lichen_old_mans_beard.jpg ), 
  tl ; dr someone with a beard, 
   touching up , color correction , etc. 
  should be fine you answered your own question, 
  yep , it 's why r/atheism is filled with angry ex-religious americans . 
  fake news is also fraud, 
  you probably think we should allow lies in the advertising business as well right ? 
  it 's either that or we start fining people for fake news and that 's pretty abusable, 
  so the obese person was me all along :(, 
  i wonder where all the obese people are hiding, 
  i thought we were forced to learn 2 languages ? 
  english + french , german or spanish, 
  look at his post history and you realize you spent way more time responding to this person than he deserves , guy does n't even appear to be european . 
  many of these subs are n't the correct subs , like people have stated . 
  would it be too much trouble to redo this ? 
  where is here ? 
  on the internet ? 
  most of the country does n't share the opinions of those people, 
  i do n't see how anyone could scoff at honesty and truth . 
  red = bad colour blue = good colour, 
  they have this twisted view that being the one who is corrupting is better than being corrupt, 
  no , it 's a guideline, 
  `` the stortinget '' would translate to `` the the great thing '' since - et is the definite article . 
  they also use sarcasm way too fucking much . 
  `` uncontrolled immigration was n't a good idea ? '', 
  `` mainstream media ca n't actually be trusted ? 
  who knew '', 
  your opinion is that all cultures are equal ? 
  time for a cats of europe series !, 
  the mods will love it, 
  it 's actually a compliment !, 
  no , northern norway, 
  there 's more to politics than immigration/refugees , maybe they 've done well in other areas . 
  or maybe the opposition is just worse . 
   social attitudes , definitely , but not cultural differences do n't the two go hand in hand ? 
  pretty grossed out by sweden being so high . 
  would have thought their reputation would have decreased a little lately , you know , because of their terrible cross country skiing performance lately, 
  the comments saying turkey is n't in europe are always downvoted . 
  why would n't you want your eggs to last longer ? 
  useless ? 
  [ they defeated charlie chaplin dude ] ( https://youtu.be/duesvcjn810?t=7 ), 
   people in sweden can pick berry 's all day long and barely make enough for a hamburger at burger king . 
  they can just eat the berries instead of the burger !, 
  if 20/20 people in an uncontacted tribe in the amazon die one day , taking with them all their history , culture and language , i 'd say that 's more sad than 20/8000000 people getting killed in new york . 
  percentages matter to me at least, 
  norwegian incident ( in norwegian ) : https://www.nrk.no/troms/--norge-krenket-finsk-luftrom-1.6862396 according to the article we also violated your airspace in 2005 , so it should say 2 , not 1 . 
  do n't hesitate to contact us if you want further violations . 
  with the old one i did n't even see that norways southern tip had a different colour,
