  what the fuck is going on here ? 
  because according to this poll you 're eastern europe, 
  did you use / r/norge for norway ? 
  did you use the proper / r/norge for norway or / r/norway ? 
  edit : speaking of which , any mods care to answer why / r/norway is linked on the side map instead of / r/norge ? 
  lol , downvote me and then ask me to explain something for you ? 
  go google it, 
  based on the opinion of people not from scandinavia . 
  as for real problems , drug overdoses are pretty bad here . 
  is that a blog with no sources ? 
  or skinny countries :(, 
  i fixed it for you http://i.imgur.com/fgrovwx.jpg, 
  why do you think some countries have decent politicians while others have `` evil '' ones ? 
  no one has done that though . 
  guess taxes is just not that big a deal for us, 
  only game available is [ american idol ] ( http://thegamer0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/american-idol-judge-panel.jpg?auto=format&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;q=50&amp;w=864&amp;h=486&amp;fit=crop ) though . 
  i 'd imagine it 's everything working together , justice system included . 
  obviously we should temporarily reinstate the death penalty whenever there 's a criminal who ca n't be reformed . 
  it would be illegal i imagine, 
   the country and it 's people are a bunch of liars and hypocrites . 
  do you think norway and the norwegian people are particularly bad compared to the rest of the world ? 
  we lie a lot do we ? 
  if i understand it right it goes both ways so you can see who looked up your income . 
  not a good idea to let someone know you 're a gold digger , 
  we already did , `` x of europe '' posts keep getting upvoted every time, 
  pretty sure there is only one god in 40k and that 's the god emperor of mankind, 
  yeah , feels good . 
  guess i 'm not killing myself today, 
  `` i deliberate everything , i consider everything '' or `` i 've deliberated everything , i 've considered everything '' ? 
  wikipedia has more recent data for the entire world : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index, 
  i too hate telling people they do n't have aids, 
  read it as 50 years of lgbt discrimination, 
  `` fuck democracy '' - mods, 
  why would christian turkey be in eu by now ?

  it 's not about being edgy . 
  a lot of people think atheism means you got ta be militant about it for some reason .

  action is n't inherently better than inaction . 
  leaving spain would be disastrous for you, 
  it 's tap * water btw . 
  if they got through all the defences in the tunnel , their own destroyed tanks blocking the route , the mess they made while bombing the british side of the tunnel ... they 'd still have to pop their head up on the other side , becoming easy targets for whatever other british defences are in the area . 
  but yes , i 'm not thinking it completely through , i 'm just having fun, 
  the defences would be inside the tunnel and bombing the tunnel would be counter productive if you intend to go through it . 
  and if they did get through , they 'd have a lot of rubble to clean up and the brits could just concentrate fire on th . . hmm . 
  i 'm beginning to see how just nuking it would be simpler . 
  yep . 
  an answer is to increase eus power so they can deal with it . 
  i guess i do n't see how you could lose the tunnel . 
  put some at caltrops in there . 
  tank destroyers . 
  every destroyed soviet/russian tank would bar further entry . 
  but this is coming from someone whose only experience with modern warfare is company of heroes edit : worst case scenario they create some kind of spider tank with impenetrable armour , but at that point you would have already lost the moat to the robotic sea snakes, 
  i do n't know man . 
  funneling the enemy into a tunnel seems easier than defending a moat, 
  a bit overkill no ? 
  seems like it would be incredible easy to defend a tunnel funnel, 
  kek, 
  you want to max out your wind resistance so that you 're not easily killed by air damage, 
  well , none of those countries have been impressing anyone lately . 
  it 's probably a cancer sub for north koreans too, 
  . dk means its danish . 
  swedish is . se, 
  ! remindme never, 
  without the / s i would have thought it actually was a radicalized gust of wind !, 
  [ we have that actually ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe ), 
  they should totally make a hellgate : moscow , set in the metro system, 
  admiral niels being norwegian of course , just like tordenskjold, 
  i think he just wanted to call you a kid, 
  two wrongs do n't make a right, 
  and a part of that is because people leave, 
  all it takes is one innocent person wrongfully convicted . 
  you 'd look like [ this ] ( http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7848/202/400/crazy1.0.jpg ) by the time you reach the top, 
  his name and his open distaste for usa . 
  it 's like how you can tell an atheist used to be religious , because they now openly express their hatred for religion . 
  not to mention the comment itself might imply that he lived there once . 
  that guy is most likely an american expat . 
  you can do better, 
  what 's irrelevant ? 
  how about not allowing people with diplomatic immunity to drive in places where the law does n't apply to them, 
  the two guys in the thumbnail look like [ jimmy and gary from bully ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a1/jimmy_and_gary.png ),

  quote from an opinion piece found on [ dagbladet . 
  ] ( http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/sverige---en-moralpolitistat/60178469 ) title : sweden - a morality police state, 
  hijabs would be okay if it was n't such a big pressure on muslim girls to wear them, 
  so women without hair would be required to wear head cover ? 
  as for examples . 
  somewhere in the bible it says that loving a man as you would a woman is a sin , or something to that degree . 
  seems pretty obvious that the bible is saying homosexuality is a sin , but christians keep saying it 's taken out of context . 
  you do n't need jesus to be a loving individual . 
  i always see people defend the disturbing shit in the bible by saying it 's taken out of context . 
  can you provide us with an example of such a case ?
