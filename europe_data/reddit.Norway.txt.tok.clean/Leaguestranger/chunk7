  it 's easily translatable into norwegian as well : gaijin = utlending gaikokujin = av utenlandsk opprinnelse and the connotation that comes with both phrases are fairly similar to their japanese equivalent even . 
  relax dude , the question was hypothetical ... 
  yeah ... you do n't understand economics at all , do you ? 
   with the ubi you will have organized groups of people working together to work against the markets , for sure . 
  i really doubt that 's how it 's going to play out in the real world , but if we were to take it to an extreme , not only would ubi people stifle the production of goods , but they 'd ruin the economy for everyone else including themselves and that would n't be in anyone 's interest , and again , the ubi money would n't be worth the paper they were printed on . 
  in a worst case scenario , you 'd end up with famines with millions of people starving to death and a severe lack of medication and sanitation amongst other things . 
  i 'm sorry to break your spirits , but deconstructing capitalism is certainly not going to be that easy , there 's a reason lenin introduced nep and millions of people died from starvation when stalin removed it . 
  i have no idea how you came up with this crackpot theory of yours . 
   companies will have to adapt . 
  by lowering their products and match those of the parallel economy . 
  but those having the ubi will continue lowering the prices and providing the people with cheaper products . 
  that does n't make any sense , honestly . 
  uib would just be regular money and a part of the monetary cycle like everything else , and if the markets operate as they do today there 's no reason to assume that people would be able to buy stuff with their ubi money ( ? ), 
  and resell it for cheap . 
  the implications would be that you 'd starve businesses for a little while then the market adjusts itself and your ubi money would n't be worth squat while the money used to make transactions between companies still would keep its value . 
   we will reach ... you can write it because i think you know it . 
  no , probably not . 
   would you promote the spread of secular liberalism in religious regions like the middle east as a factor in foreign policy ? 
  honestly , we should n't meddle with countries we have no business meddling with unless they pose a direct threat to europe . 
  forcing an ideology upon people does n't seem like a particularly good idea to me either , and it 'd probably create more tension and contempt towards europe amongst middle-easterners which is something we do n't need in this political climate . 
  well , if you want to donate , find an ngo in romania that 's working on the relevant issues . 
  this one for instance : http://www.apd.ro/en_us/, 
  it 's an actual public protest , not some professionally paid ngo protest . 
  `` l\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in '' comes to mind . 
  [ nrk ] ( https://www.nrk.no/ ) generally is regarded as the news source with the least amount of bias . 
  nrk used reports ^ ^ ^ ^ [ 1 ] ( https://polisen.se/global/www%20och%20intrapolis/%c3%96vriga%20rapporter/kriminella%20natverk%20med%20stor%20paverkan%20i%20lokalsamhallet%20sekretesspr%2014.pdf ) ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ [ 2 ] ( http://polisen.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/eu-rapport-utvardering-jarva1.pdf ) by the swedish police as their reference too and if you bothered to read the article i 've linked the swedish police even described it as such :  en politirapport den svenske rikspolisen offentliggjorde i 2014 , lister opp 55 av utenforskapsomr\u00e5dene som spesielt utsatte bydeler , hvor kriminelle nettverk har sterk innflytelse . 
  i really do n't know if it 's the norm or not , honestly . 
  but the family i stayed with were lovely and almost treated me like a son-in-law . 
  this was almost five years ago and i regularly stay in touch with them and i 've visited them again after my initial stay there . 
  politics and serving our own interests really . 
  if russia were our ally and if all of europe were a part of the warsaw pact or some form of alliance other than nato , we 'd probably turn a blind eye on crimea as well and sanction the us because of the alleged `` war on terror '' . 
  yup , they actually had those too . 
  i ended up just showering regularly for the most part , though . 
   ( especially since the police get little more than a hot dog and a pat on the back in terms of resources to actually operate with ) . 
  probably because it really was n't a necessity with before these `` ghettoized '' areas started forming , and both police and government have n't properly adjusted to the new realities yet . 
  i knew quite a bit before moving there as well , but there are always the small things you * do n't * know about . 
  i lived with a host family and one of the things that really caught me off-guard was that the family shared the bathwater , and i was expected to do the same . 
  obviously , you wash your body thoroughly before entering the tub , but still , it was off-putting for me initially , then you get used to it and it is n't all * that * weird anymore . 
  i think it 's real to some degree . 
  our state-owned tv channel has done a lot of in-depth reporting and research on these issues in sweden where they 've interviewed police chiefs in these areas about `` problematic zones '' or `` utenforskapsomr\u00e5der '' as they 're called , and according to the police , there are about 50 or so places in different swedish cities where the police partially have lost control and where the violent crime rate is elevated . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.nrk.no/urix/svensk-politi_-_-vi-er-i-ferd-med-a-miste-kontrollen-1.12920404 ) the nrk crew has been attacked on several occasions trying to report from some of these areas as well . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pt2dmilsq ) people that say there 's not certain problems in some areas are either ill-informed or willfully ignorant . 
  i 've lived in japan for one year and the us for 6 months . 
  both countries gave me different flavors of culture shock and i honestly could n't tell you which one of them that gave me the greatest amount . 
  in japan , like in norway , people are really not intrusive at all and leave you alone unless you specifically address someone , while in the us people you do n't know might strike up a conversation while you 're waiting for the bus or doing something mundane that involves waiting , and i 've experienced it first hand . 
  the language barrier obviously was bigger in japan and if i did n't speak the language at all , i 'd probably be inclined to say that japan gave me the greater culture shock of the two . 
  i 've been to other countries too obviously , but not outside of being a tourist , and being a tourist really does n't give me an authentic feeling of the day-to-day life in said countries and certainly not the foundation to assess whether i 've experienced a culture shock or not . 
  [ say that one more time please ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/karl_xiis_likf%c3%a4rd_%281884%29%2c_m%c3%a5lning_av_gustaf_cederstr%c3%b6m_%281845-1933%29.jpg ) . 
  eu was n't created to prevent war or ensure stability , nato was . 
  the eu as it is today was created with a mix of pragmatic and ideological underlinings . 
  ideologically as in `` united states of europe '' , and if you 've listened to people like guy verhofstad speak , he certainly is an ideologue and has a clear vision for the future of europe , but i sometimes get the impression that he cares more about the european project than the peoples of europe . 
  i listened to an interview with him about brexit and his new book the other day , where , in one of the segments he and the host discussed `` the rise of populism '' and the refugee crisis , and i was left with the impression that he cared about limiting the influx of refugees for purpose of shutting down populism , rather than appeasing the worries of the public -- the working class in particular , and generally to prevent problems the immigration might cause . 
  the pragmatic part would be everything that 's bilaterally beneficial for the member states , but you do n't need to federalize to have all of that . 
   germans who buy `` norwegian hydroelectricity '' essentially buy certificates for the electricity to be produced in norway . 
  ah , makes sense . 
  i 've read that we 're still buying a lot of nuclear/coal from countries since we 're exporting energy , but perhaps that 's unrelated to the certificate thing . 
  one thing i find really dumb is that some germans buy hydroelectricity from us specifically because it 's clean , and the logic they use to justify it is so short-sighted that i want to shoot myself thinking about it . 
  essentially , they 're paying to virtue signal whilst moving the carbon footprint elsewhere , and as the net output of renewable energy is n't increased or affected positively , it wo n't have any environmental impact whatsoever since we 'll have to buy the energy we sell back , mostly from coal/nuclear plants . 
  actually , it might even have a negative impact in the long run since i reckon some of the energy would be lost during transportation . 
  i do n't feel too strongly about it honestly , but i do understand why the decision to close the subreddit was made . 
  i have doubts about the reasoning behind the ban , and i think the mods increasingly have been looking for a legitimate reason to shut it down since the label `` hotbed for nazis '' really is n't a good one from a business perspective . 
  in norway , ideologies ( communism , socialism , national socialism and french/german nationalism ) and their history are covered extensively throughout the history lessons while the mainstream political parties , what they stand for etc. 
  are covered in `` samfunnsfag '' or `` social studies '' which is a subject we have . 
  according to statistics , yes . 
  some are integrated , others are n't . 
   i 've become biased as to what i 've seen online and i do n't know if i 'm in the right or wrong . 
  you 're asking a bunch of people that has their own biases and anecdotes you know , the best thing would be to look at actual statistics and the long-term impact it might , or might not have . 
   could you elaborate ? 
  yeah , sure . 
  progressives in america would n't like it very much if every illegal immigrant were to be deported , and there has been a huge ruckus over trump wanting to deport illegals with a criminal record even . 
  in norway there 's no question about it , every illegal immigrant is deported , with or without a crime record . 
  when it comes to refugees we have one of the strictest laws in europe as well , and out government has been criticized for it . 
  for example that they 're taking x-rays of the skeleton and the teeth of refugees that claims to be underaged amongst other things , they 've also committed to sending people back as soon as their respective countries are safe for return . 
  lots of our immigrants are from the eu and the schengen area though . 
  they have adopted parts of the russian traditional dress due to their shared history, 
   it 's supposed to describe an environment that can lead to a fascist regime and does n't really concern itself with a particular implementation of fascism . 
  i 'm not quite sure if trump is the manifestation of such an environment since the * far * right in the us still is a fringe , albeit a growing one , mostly due to the fact that white people are disgruntled with the identity politics of the left . 
  the best case scenario of a trump presidency as i see it would be if he 'd manage to create even growth , thus making the left/right polarization stagnate and rekindle the spirit of american patriotism which in the past has been the common , uniting denominator amongst people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds and something that is sorely needed in such a multicultural society . 
  if he ca n't do that , i have no idea what the future holds . 
  but , give the man a chance i say , after all , he 's the symptom and not the underlying problem . 
   fascism does n't require anti-jewish or anti-israeli opinions . 
  no , but i think it 's a prerequisite if you 're going to draw parallels to hitler . 
  other than that , i agree with the rest of your post . 
  the far-right forces like trump because he 'll nudge the public discourse and the overton window rightwards , more so than anyone else . 
   has so far spent a week badly reenacting hitlers early policies . 
  i know you 're emotional , but try to be sensible about it . 
  trump did n't bully people into voting for him , he has n't in any way tried to outlaw other political parties or to abolish democracy , his daughter converted to judaism and he is vehemently pro-israel . 
  michael moore and many progressive americans praise norway as some progressive utopia and uses it in their political narrative , but fails to aknowledge that some of the reason the systems we have in place work so well is because of cultural homogenity and cohesiveness which ensures lasting social stability , low leves of corruption etc. 
  and god forbid if they knew about our `` progressive '' immigration policies .

   and could help companies shed new light and get different views on the most optimal strategies going forward . 
  i definitely see how that * can * be beneficial for certain companies , but the premise of that argument is still wrong in many ways , namely that `` diversity '' oftentimes mean tangible diversity such as skin colour or gender , rather than diversity of minds and talents . 
  i generally subscribe to equality of opportunity , not equality of success . 
  yeah , i feel like the policies enacted in norway are based on the assumption that every individual , regardless of gender or any other relevant vector , is a blank slate without any predispositions at all . 
  social scientists , which i 'm going to assume are planted somewhere far-left on the political spectrum describes the gender distribution in certain professions as problematic , and i always find myself asking `` why ? 
  '' , what 's the problem with people picking traditionally , why is it a problem that there are more female nurses and more male engineers . 
  if a woman wishes to work in a male dominated profession , nothing is stopping her . 
  our state channel did a documentary on this a couple of years ago that i 'd recommend you to watch : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvatc15plvs, 
  egalitarianism went a little too far here if you ask me .
