  hm i mean when i swear i just do it , i do n't apologise for it, 
  honestly the view of the baltic states conquest being viewed as uniquely `` illegal '' is something that bothers me a lot i 'm not in the mood to discuss it though, 
  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, 
  probably estonia as a reaction from anti-russia hysteria, 
  they have canary birds as mascot for some reason , so something along those lines i guess, 
  you have to be an immense idiot to believe that, 
  i like how it is currently in any case , subdivisions should n't be able to have their own laws, 
  it is neoliberalism incarnate, 
  well see , you are the very first not-norwegian i 've ever heard suggest that 's something americans think it 's also not really a stereotype , you know, 
  i do n't think there really is any american stereotypes about norway, 
  yea i do n't get it either , but the way the floor works means it dries itself up eventually, 
  what does that even mean, 
  i think it 's supposed to mean russia attacks ftr i do not endorse them, 
  i guess `` far left '' , but i mean that within the parliamentary system , not fringe stuff like he 's probably left of the labourer party , but i think he could fit in with red or socialistic left party, 
  help assad win is the most realistic way too little too late at this point , though, 
  depends on the job though i mean if you do n't want to learn the language , you really should n't move here, 
  from my experience this is actually pretty lax , and european integration is bad anyway, 
  tax is in price there is however a special system where bottles you pay a wee bit extra not on the price tag that you get back if you put the bottles back into the recycling machine thing they have in grocery stores tip is basically `` keep the change '' , so nothing if you 're paying with cards, 
  they 're basically extorters, 
  something like `` the wood chip city '' the timber industry is all gone though , so it does n't fit anymore, 
  westlanders and north-norwegians often think the eastland is nothing besides oslo and that breaks my heart, 
  never really paid attention to it some from my university , the one in oslo , has sometimes said it has high international acclaim , but i do n't think i 've heard of any specific rankings or things like that from online friends i 've heard some pretty bad things about the ivy league, 
   the eu actually tried to impose stricter rules on the banks after the crisis turning the dial from 1 to 2 when it should go to 11 also  it is much more protective to individual people and social rights than the usa for instance . 
  not really an achievement to have better healthcare than america, 
  i think that was the autocorrect on the telephone, 
  they 're called earth mothers, 
  not very , but perhaps more than contemporary foreign trends anyway but you know , nothing about the vikings is relevant anymore, 
  we save `` lord god '' all the time , maybe more than you do omg in english, 
  people who 're willing to talk to you are mostly the not-racist people very likely someone overheard you speak , and thought ill of you , but kept that to himself, 
  yes, 
  i again feel that this does n't figure in to most norwegians imagination . 
  certainly many would support an invasion , i believe , but i think most just do n't even consider the option of nuclear weapons keep in mind this is just my impression of things, 
  my impression is that most people here view it much the same way americans do, 
  this is antitethical to the ideas which this country is founded upon, 
  hm mouth before thought i 'm kinda stumped though , you 're right i guess the reason it 's a common `` rethorical device '' in america is because they 're pretty conciously aware they have nuclear weapons , while we do n't , you know, 
  you know i think even the most staunch right-wing american nationalists are against using nuclear weapons, 
  they may be less verbal about it , sure, 
  i can totally see where you 're coming from . 
  i apologise if this comes across as like `` i , an outsider , understands better how your culture works than you do '' , especially since my knowledge is n't that wide , but i believe the concept of `` white identity '' or `` whiteness '' originated in america, 
  oxymoron most people reject my notion that eu is neoliberal , i 'm quite amused you own it instead, 
  it should be illegal like `` real child pornography '' , as should pornography in general, 
  white identity is n't that much of a thing in europe for example here in norway , most of the people that are racist towards muslims are racist towords poles and lithuanians as well, 
  they are, 
  lot 's of people in oslo ca n't pronounce oslo, 
  tail-in ', 
  i do n't really understand what you mean, 
  is n't this a fairly individual thing ? 
  g\u00f8teborg i do n't really like that place , though, 
  too obsessed with language better math notation though, 
  constitution was originally a bit of a mess , at points it stated that the great council had two chambers , others that it only had one . 
  so the solution was that sometimes the council would split into two to deal with certain matters . 
  however in i think 2010 this practice ended and it 's now only the one chamber, 
  english in primary , german , french or spanish in secondary spanish is pretty new to that list , and has greatly decreased the number of students that go for french , to the point that it 's in `` critical condition '', 
  it 's very far off also norway is n't really hit by terror attacks, 
  being a neoliberal dystopia, 
  no first of all , the powers in europe are n't really better than the american ones but even if that was n't the case , it would still not be worth making the lives of millions of americans worse, 
  and you clearly should n't, 
  well then , op asks  if you have a middle class 40 hours a week job ( ... ) is it a good idea to travel across europe on weekends and holidays ? 
  and you have demonstrated that the answer is no, 
  then you 're not middle class, 
  you are greatly mistaken, 
  it 's based on my impression of the state of socio-economics to some extent i assume stockholm is n't that different from where i live in this regard, 
  on the street i look i guess pretty douchey with long hair and an unwelcoming expression undressed i am hideous :(, 
  i agree in essence , but i do n't think the world is anywhere close to achieve this , and that severe change is needed on the national level ( or further below ) before `` utopian unions '' should even be attempted in your eyes , the eu has done pretty well , but in my eyes , it has been an obstruction in the path to a better world, 
  i 've grown to be pretty complaicant regarding shitty tech, 
  the internet is filled with awful people, 
  norwegian politics is pretty split left-right , so like i think all the parties would pretty much reject working with a party from the other side except the few centre governments that were founded , but i do n't think that fits what you describe, 
  personally i find it pretty sickening how many people say racist things regarding finland ( linkening to turks or mongolia , and calling those lower races as well , you know ), 
  i severly doubt it, 
  i have no representatives in parliament nobody from the list i voted on made it, 
  people , mostly not from finland , talking often and at length about how great finland is i just have bad experiences , basically, 
  :| i guess i do n't like that way of saying it , but choose your battles and all of that, 
  the main offender i have met is argentinian lol, 
  it ca n't sustain itself, 
  i saw it in middle school we kinda ended up memeing about it in our class , but from what i remember it was pretty decent, 
  their grivances with the world are justified too bad they 're a theocracy though : /, 
  svalbard is an integral part of the country , and therefore not `` overseas '' . 
  overseas bits are maud 's land and bouvet and peter 1 islands, 
  oh sweet antarctic, 
  it 's hard to pinpoint . 
  sweden has like always had more progressive policies than us . 
  i guess the most telling is that if you 're openly racist in sweden , you get publicly ostrisised ( dunno spelling ) , while if you 're openly racist in norway , most people are pretty cool about it, 
  should n't happen at all eu should be dissolved, 
  well like i kinda do n't care because i do n't want to talk with them in the first place : /, 
  it 's called global warming `` climate change '' was a term crafted by anti-environmentalists to seem more neutral and less threathening, 
  sweden is pretty stuck-up but i mean they also are more progressive finland is also more progressive , but i really do n't like the `` fanclub '' of that country , though i guess that 's not as much a problem with finland themselves russia on the other hand is less progressive , and flatly worse to live in , but i kinda admire the relentlessness of their character, 
  something like : `` wait , they exist ? '', 
  i really like alexandra as a name for boys more outlandish names float in my mind , like immanuel but i do n't think very much about this and have no real plans, 
   in most countries of the world , the flag is a symbol of the state , and the power of the state . 
  but during the 3 years war against prussia , the danish flag became a flag of the people , rather than a flag of the state . 
  it is what we call a hurra-flag , a symbol of celebration , rather than a symbol of denmark . 
  yea mostly the same quite notably it became like a symbol of resistance during the years of nazi occupation, 
  i talked once with a brit who went to oslo and tried to find prostitutes . 
  he remarked that none of them were white, 
  the environmental party the greens ( bit of a mouthful of a name ) everything they do recieves ridiculuously more scrutiny than any other political party . 
  it feels currently like the media has conspired to wipe them of the map, 
  closest i guess is `` occupied '' but that 's like a super crazy what-if scenario where america has left nato and whatnot, 
  why would you want to ? 
  center left ? 
  the labourer party is currently in opposition , but still the party with most support,
