  i can hardly muster to see a movie twice in the same decade, 
  relaxing things, 
  norway is `` technically '' just the parts west of the mountains, 
  i do n't really think i have that kind of problem , no, 
  i 'm not sure what you mean ? 
  i pretty much just have to push it away from my face sometimes ( it 's kinda long ) , and it 's fine, 
  not very , i do n't think i think it 's popularity has diminished a lot the past 10 years, 
  usually once per week sometimes only once per forthnight i think it varies a lot, 
  does spending hours in a supermarket plus a two hour drive both to get there and get back not sound horrible to you ? 
  mine, 
  ukraine , they seem to differ from most of europe, 
  our history only begins after antiquity, 
  not entierly sure , but i think he really is the model king of this age, 
  i generally like both the national song and the national hym the king song is pretty lame though, 
  i think most people here agree, 
  i used to , but this is no longer the town i grew up in, 
  question is why would they, 
  1800 's i think it used to be pretty intense . 
  like you had to memorise iirc hundreds of cathecisms for your confirmation . 
  if you failed , you had to try again next year . 
  and you were n't considered to be adult until you did , so some people had to try and try for decades, 
  never really happened we always lose, 
  the poor and trashy places are generally outside of the cities, 
  they 're all pretty rubbish tbh, 
  we did that for 500 years not again, 
  dunno if primorye counts as europe , since it 's in russia, 
  i 'm not sure stereotypes about norway exists outside of scandinavia, 
   supermarket 's international foods aisle ? 
  that 's a thing ? 
  `` norway '' sounds disgusting it 's like an amalgamation of the most un-norwegian sounds imaginable, 
  it should be avoided until global communism is achieved, 
  emmigrating is too far from my mind to really consider this question, 
  hard to rank any one thing as more interesting than anything else, 
  the norwegian flag is held in very high regard i 'm not totally against it , because during the war it took on anti-nazism connotations, 
  lot 's of admittedly shitty but kinda iconic buildings razed down , and new shitty high-rise being build what 's happening is basically the complete opposite of deurbanisation/suburbanisation/depopulation , and i hate it, 
  surrendering territory to russia after they crossed the border in 1945, 
  going to sweden to shop might be money saving , but it 's also one of the most dreadful things imaginable, 
  you 're wrong, 
  it 's a complicated matter related to neoliberalism and imperialism . 
  you can look at greece as an example . 
  basically if eu was n't evil , i 'd be ( mostly ) okay with countries besides my own joining it , but this is not the reality we live in, 
  i do n't think so , but sometimes i wonder, 
  unfourtunately, 
  not only do i want to stay out , i want the union completely dissolved, 
  easy to pinpoint the bad guys, 
  nordic countries , german-speaking countries and czechia maybe italy , not sure on that one, 
  depends how eager they are to bring it up, 
  nope, 
  is there even any competition ? 
  norway does n't allow it ( unless it creates unreasonable burden ) . 
  apparantly they 're going to start allowing it , but i 'm against that, 
  i looked it up your 's is pretty dull, 
  what do you mean, 
  lot of the fancy words , for example `` intention '' is getting used a lot lately ( though slightly norvagised to `` intensjon '' ), 
  in ireland they call it soccer, 
  yes, 
  not exactly what you 're asking for , but using femenine noun conjugation ( or whatevr it 's called ) is kinda looked down upon , seen as `` improper speech '' for lowlifes and so on, 
  in apartments i guess i dunno , i live in a house, 
  oh no , on the contrary , mon ami, 
  america and israel, 
  i do n't know but if you do understand it it 's hillarious, 
  probably did that on the sami, 
  catholisism i guess, 
   does your country have a word endemic to it 's mentality or lifestyle approach ? 
  `` bullshit '' should fit, 
  i think of it mostly regarding support of eu-membership, 
  wreck of the fms northern star in fallout 4 lol, 
  seven is `` sju '', 
  only ones i 've seen are the royal castle ( which you foreigners call palace ) in oslo and like summer residences of the danish royal family of those , the castle in oslo is more impressive i 'd say , though the garden in denmark was really lovely, 
   all active and controlling the whole territory ? 
  :p yea, 
  no , the real problem is neoliberalism, 
  i 've never liked it, 
  politicians most out of touch with the people , i sometimes feel, 
  norway had at one points four kings at once, 
  my approach to tipping is the `` keep the change '' kind which obviously means you ca n't tip if you do n't pay cash, 
  no country should be able to enforce its laws in another, 
  then what do n't you get, 
  i do n't know them by heart , no, 
  the only difference between compound words in english and german is that in english there 's ( usually ) a space between the words schadenfreude can easily be translated as for example pain joy, 
  we got female conscription a few years back, 
  only at home do i spend enough time with people to thouroughly get to hate them, 
  we should , but no, 
  do n't you understand compound words ? 
  i guess , but only one of my friends did it , and he eventually stopped as i mostly stopped using facebook, 
  in middle school there 's a few class secessions in the science class devoted to it . 
  i hardly remember anything . 
  i believe it 's quite inadequate , and severely maladjusted to the wide range of ages kids become sexually active, 
  america, 
  backpacks, 
  sure , why not, 
  dunno probably not if it was just jan mayen at stake, 
  with the virgin islands ? 
  i 'll pass and i 'll pass on the union with neighboors too, 
  those are writing standards , not talking standards, 
  that does n't actually exist, 
  norwegian has no `` standard '' speaking variant, 
  nonono it 's about the masses verses the elite, 
  there are more than one anti-eu movement, 
  moderates are right-wing,
