  double disgusting, 
  you forget the prior 91 years , and underestimate the call for war in sweden at the time ( ftr there was call for war in norway too ) also we became independant before the referendum . 
  that was a formality our government was n't really interested in, 
  4 attempts, 
  die dissapointed , not die of dissapointment learn2read, 
  and bank speculation is the only alternative innit, 
  i hope you 'll die dissapointed, 
  except we rejected eu ( ec , rather ) before getting rich, 
  because we 're not stupid, 
  because we are the ones who fought for freedom and they were the ones who tried to take it from us, 
  i was there once not much there worth of note, 
  and macron both seem to be and actually is shit, 
  i am severly dissapointed in you, 
  he seemed pretty cool, 
  you even have the falgsc meme in your flair , but you ca n't see that macron is right-wing ? 
  my impression is that lot 's of chinese news outlets clinched the oppurtunity to trashtalk a western country ( quite a golden oppurtunity , since we 're kinda irrelevant , they can get away with a lot more than they could with say france or especially america ) also they can quite easily just misrepresent xiabou 's views, 
  cars, 
  considering our mutual diplomatic history since 2010 i 'd expect something quite else, 
  most of this sub consists of `` europhiles '' , rightwing ( `` centrist '' ) liberals , that have come to view macron as `` their guy '' . 
  an attack on him thus becomes an attack on them . 
  i wo n't critisise people just for the `` connection '' they have with macron , i feel similar about for example corbyn , but i will critisise them for being of the politics that macron represents . 
  macron was a bad choice for france and humanity at large . 
  the only reason he 's president is because le pen was an ever worse choice, 
  tories would kill the poor if they could britain might have one of the most despicaple right-wings of any countries, 
  man what a clown, 
  prageru is on the list of the worst things ever, 
  macron will not work against global warming, 
  that 's a rather juvenile way to put it, 
  that means nothing, 
  russia was the part that was it, 
  russia was sssr, 
  wow how dare the russians dislike a millitary alliance created specifically to antagonise them, 
  ostensibly they have to take it back or renounce their claim on it before getting to join nato, 
  how is this meassured ? 
  how is dprk not in peace , while rk is ? 
  i should make a map of the word `` repost '' in european languages, 
  if only it would fall in the winter, 
  i have a czech-norwegian friend irl his grandfather used to be a senator it seems to be quite a `` dispute '' in czechia about whether they are more closely culturally linked to germany or to `` the slavic nations '', 
  then maybe do n't assume i 'm a a dumb russian fascist ? 
  societaseuropas also personally attacked and slandered me , basically calling me a nazi without any proof, 
  i 'm talking about the environment and shit, 
  arkhaengelsk is also on the map, 
  what the fuck are you talking about, 
  that was the only good reason to support him . 
  yet here they are , giving him unneccesarily large powers in parliament macron needs to be surpressed , not assisted, 
  only took them like 10 years to not screw up the process, 
   weather , food , brexit britain never gets critisised for this it 's mainly with regards to football the country gets discussed, 
  i 'm not sure this map has a credible source it 's also undergone a few unjustified changes by wikipedia editors, 
   in the lower one are the five nordic prime ministers , holding a ball with the sustainability goals so it represents exactly the opposite of their politics, 
  lot 's of comments mentioning the gulf stream most scientists nowadays has figured the gulf stream is not a chief factor in the relatively mild climate in europe, 
  it 's equally as pointless as any of the other cities marked, 
  well sorry to not be verbose to people who are flat-out wrong, 
  ehm , no, 
  yea it 's wrong, 
   it is just a historical fact that at that time slavs lived in these areas well i mean yea , you can see on the map above those areas not being in germany  my intention is not to demand recognition of the slavic nature of eastern germany . 
  there 're still some sorbs around, 
  yes it is, 
  there 'd be need for more inspections , pretty sure that 's about it, 
  she may be smart but she 's still evil basically i guess putin stands out as a shrewd politician , so he 's pretty `` street-smart '' , but i mean , i could easily be missing someone ; i do n't even who half of the world 's leaders are, 
  what the fuck are you talking about, 
  just because you do it does n't mean millions of others would too, 
  i said if i was polish, 
  like , if i was polish i would not at all tolerate this, 
  the polandball reference is poor and untastefull it should be changed, 
  almost exactly as i 'd thought tbh, 
   though crimea presence will probably make it not so popular here though it would make it correct, 
  you know one can be against boh the eu and the tories, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_free_trade_association#portugal_fund you 're welcome, 
  because i do n't like neoliberalism, 
  i 'm anti-eu but not for the stupid reasons le pen is, 
   the thing is that she ( and all other anti-eu people ) do n't actually have any idea what they want speak for yourself, 
  i mean it 's not that hard to not be as awful as silicon valley, 
  making things even worse , sweet, 
  i think so , but the correct word is `` heller '' , not `` enten '', 
  lmao, 
  being worst out of 5 is n't that terrible and it always has to be someone, 
  17th may obvs, 
  yea but i was compelled to say it anyway but i really have difficulty parsing his posts, 
  also for the record i stopped treating trump as a joke around the time the bus clip got out, 
  i do n't understand ? 
  it 's pretty disingenous ( spelling ) to pretend eu does n't affect norway for one thing i care about the people of earth , and how eu effects both those inside and outside of it also my views on these kinds of matters are n't exclusive to my country , i know for example an anti-eu portugese ( i had sort of a better way to say this figured out , but it slipped my mind ) ps : i learned a while ago , but after i made my flair , that back in the viking ages germany was apparantly called southway , which i found mildly interesting, 
  why do you ? 
  norway already has too many people, 
  nobody should copy german politics, 
  why not no union at all ? 
  `` news '', 
  lolno, 
  there are plenty of people who are n't really anti-capitalists who still want better conditions for people, 
  because they are n't idiots, 
   really ? 
  other than the leave the single market stuff i like it a lot tsk tsk, 
  labour 's offer is great , this is the first time in decades they have n't been shit, 
   i 've seen these positions in either some hardcore leftist movements in europe , who will argue that the eu is backed by liberist ideals and is essentially oppressive of the working class . 
  that does n't sound too labour to me . 
  it 's the truth , though, 
  `` ending free movement of people '' is basically propaganda to smear the anti-eu side it 's not called free movement of people , but free movement of labourforce, 
  data being from 2 years ago is supposed to sink the argument ? 
  eu is garbage, 
  good day to remind europe that unions are bad, 
  `` civil law '' is just what england calls everything else useless map,
