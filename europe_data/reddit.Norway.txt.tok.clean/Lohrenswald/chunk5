  international laws is n't reality, 
  i do n't know the entire timeline , but it 's lost and regained that status several times , and has at times been eclipsed by several other cities, 
  crimea, 
  i unironically love this post, 
  again , not still, 
  and ? 
  yea but look at for example japan, 
  seems like grey is both `` no religion '' and `` no data '', 
  what really throws me off is that it seems to me many americans think the people who are against circumcision are the weird ones, 
  that 's really stupid always has been, 
  a referendum to leave a union is very different from electing fascists, 
  calling him `` europe 's last dictator '' is a hot take from the 90 's , not a factual statement of any kind, 
  of course not, 
  i know , the problem is that the parody is bad , and thus unfun, 
  well sorry to be so blunt , but it was boring and out of touch with reality ( even the reality of stereotypes ) i 'm fine with you being insulting , but at least be clever about it, 
  this is wrong, 
  i really do n't understand how sweden can seem less stuck up than anyone else, 
  wow how original and insightful, 
   there is one called captain thundershield he 's norwegian kthnx, 
  * great britain, 
  i hope the voters rectify this mistake this fall, 
  a bad idea, 
  it just is n't, 
  misleading ? 
  making that other comment did remind me of one i guess sort of scary story that involves trolls lol basically there 's a glacier and the trolls living there have sort of vowed to eat anyone who walks on the glacier at night ( i do n't remmeber the details of this story ) . 
  basically one bloke does n't make it home before sunset and is stuck on the glacier , the trolls show up to get him . 
  thing is that the trolls go for people who * walk * on the glacier at night , so to avoid getting eaten the bloke stands perfectly still the entire night, 
   it 's a very scottish story but i 've no doubt that other places have similar tales . 
  so something a bit like this there 's a lot of tales considered a big part of norwegian culture/heritage ( for example a recurring figure is a poor but humble kid who goes through hardships ( sometimes involving outwitting trolls ) but wins the princess in the end , among many others ) , but the fact is apparantly that very many of these tales originate from the levant , brought back by crusaders and given sort of a local coat of paint, 
   i 'm curious if the european one is accurate to you guys no, 
  here 's a stupid one : i bet most people outside scandinavia do n't know we call ourself northmen ( irrespective of gender for some reason ), 
  bergen, 
  the attic, 
  any west coast tbh when it comes to america ( the states united thereof ) i rather think about `` california and oregon and washington '' and would most likely use those names instead, 
  negatively . 
  this is one of the chief massive faults of human society at large note that i 'd like for multinational corporations based in norway , like statoil , to leave foreign nations as well, 
  same, 
   spoken no  understood yea mostly i think depends heavily on the individual, 
  new what ? 
  the future is n't not going to happen, 
  no pensions are based on what you earn throughout your life , and i 'm pretty sure both my parents were employed around the age i 'm at now , while i 'm a complete failure, 
  i mean there 's like soulfriend instead of soulmate people use `` platonic '' as if he did n't speak about `` conventional love '' but that 's completely the opposite of my interpretation of what he said, 
  no i 'm fairly confident people would , but i could n't tell you how to get in contact with them i 'm not trying to convince you not to move , but i just ca n't help you with doing so if i ever do find anything to help i 'll get back to you, 
  yea, 
  there are none, 
  no  if no , are there saunas anywhere near where you live ? 
  yes, 
  europe would ultimately win in that they 'd avoid being conquered , but they would fail in counter-conquering america, 
  yea they suck it 's actually a fairly major issue in this election i think lol loads of people have argued for abolishing the `` counties '' , so we 'd only have municipalities directly under the state , and also merge a bunch of municipalities , but the current government now has a super stupid proposal about `` regions '' which is all whack and its all fucking stupid current system is good . 
  there 's only one kind of division at any level ( like unlike say britain or bosnia ) , and the administrative units correspond to the electoral circles . 
  messing this up is the stupidest fucking thing, 
  i mean i could define as a group of people : 1 ) live in norway 2 ) i do n't know them and that 'd be the answer like what are you trying to get at, 
  i know , but i 'm not entierly sure about the average map proficiency in this country like i know where north korea is , but there 's a lot of places in this country i 'm not entierly sure where are that `` less scholarly people '' i bet could pinpoint in a heartbeat, 
  norwegian and english i had 5 years of german in school , but i 've hardly used it at all the past 4 years or so , so i can hardly say i know it at this point . 
  which is a great shame, 
  canada in europe , scotland, 
  you what, 
  cities are n't beautiful, 
  eu always sucked membership number should be reduced to zero, 
  beaches lol, 
  good question , answer is i do n't know, 
  to be fair to him the wording of the form seems pretty bogus . 
  it asks residency status and then offers as one of the options a nationality status, 
  shit, 
   what do they mean ? 
  do most of them have the same suffixes or are they all different ? 
  i get an impression you already know  optional : is yours quite common or unique ? 
  what 's its etymology ? 
  very unique , only about 60 people like in the world has it ( mostly in norway but i know of at least one in sweden ) it 's the name of a place that does n't exist, 
  it 's stupid to put clear divides between things like that chemists do n't refuse to talk about organic chemistry because it 's biology, 
  no how people lived 100 or 1000 years ago is not an event, 
  problem is i 'm lazy also i usually get countered by people mentioning the eu parliament which is really besides the point of what i 'm talking about but i 'm not sure how to like make argument i 've got a lot of material on the eu i 've wanted to get through to be able to make more robust arguements , but i have a bunch of personal issues going on that like kinda hinders me at a lot of stuff really i should keep quiet but i am kinda emotionally invested you know, 
  we were once going to a parking house in l\u00fcbeck and it had some sort of token coin system and it was just weird, 
  `` european ideal '' lmao, 
  neoliberalism is n't trivial, 
  honestly i 'm pretty butthurt we 're as big a part of eu as we are already, 
  lol am i ( in ) famous now personally i do n't really pay attention to usernames on reddit so i apologise if we 've spoken before, 
  the eu is an obstacle to make things better, 
  olympic games suck boooo, 
  well tbh i think history education is better the less focused on `` events '' it is, 
  i was liked bullied in school but not because something easily labeled like being foreign or sexual orientation, 
  because the eu is terrible, 
  br\u00fcssel is surely closest to a capital of eu , despite a lot of institutions being in strassburg and elsewhere do n't conflate eu and europe , though, 
  well do n't say `` for europeans '' when you mean `` for eu-citizens '', 
  which is it , eu or europe, 
  only kid movies get dubbed because they 're not as accustomed to reading quickly, 
  8 excluding native norway and france where i 've been at a transit airport, 
  have n't heard this one from abroad pisspreik - pisspreach it essentially means bullshit, 
  newspapers, 
  i mean it 's not all one or the other you 've got both kinds in america too, 
  boring people get loud, 
  that 's not a stereotype, 
  hyperbole, 
  those are n't really stereotypes like , it 's supposed to be perceptions about the people right , so it ca n't be nature vikings are well known , but knowing about them is n't a notion about how the people today are the thing about being rich , if people think individual norwegians are generally wealthy that would be a stereotype ( though wrong ) , but i 'm under the empression people know it 's mostly the state funding a welfare state like , to compare with germany : that germans are punctual is a stereotype ; that the autobahn exist is not, 
  like what genuinely i 'm curious, 
  was gon na say no but i saw a swede in this thread mention the sami flag and yea there 's that otherwise no , there is quite a culture around the flag , almost a bit like the americans technically the counties and municipalities have their own flags , but those are mainly displayed as coat-of-arms/heraldries/whatever, 
  so people in greece are okay with `` american stripes '' in the flag ? 
  i do n't know any stereotypes about us besides like the swedish notion we 're in the stone age, 
  they 're idiots if `` white nationalism '' was ever a thing we would n't have all these wars between these `` white countries '', 
  i have the flag flair for a reason,
