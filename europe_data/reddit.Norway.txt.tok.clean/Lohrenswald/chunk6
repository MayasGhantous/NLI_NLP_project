  harald hairfair is vaguely liked , but you know , there 's not much known about him, 
  my own tbh, 
  ostensibly it can , but that has to be planned , and it 'll essentially only transfer the problem to another country like , getting a bunch of younglings from another country to take care of our elders instead of their own, 
  makes sense, 
  i have n't heard anything about alexander rybak since he won eurovision back in 2007 or 8 dunno if he 's the `` biggest '' though ( also he 's of iirc belarussian descent but whatever ), 
  nah , i 'd rather not strain the planet further it 's probably already too late to like counter `` the elderwave '', 
   is there anyone in your country calling for a return to absolutism ? 
  no  how would you react if someone did ? 
  i 'd call them idiots, 
  not here, 
  sure , why not, 
  lunch : bread dinner : probably pizza, 
   five eyes ? 
  that was a horrible plan b the government enacted when the people rejected their ideas i am 100 % in favour of leaving the eea yesterday, 
  flair, 
  luxury problem, 
  lunch and dinner are nothing alike, 
  we rejected eu twice while everybody else ate that shit up, 
  mostly the memes you 're already familiar with, 
  there is no `` anglosphere '', 
   in norway we have the phrase `` skitt fiske '' , which often is used to wish someone good luck with the catches before a fishing trip . 
  it is, 
  no i mean i 've learned a bit , but not a lot no i use this kinda `` egotistically '' , like talking about what i think and not caring much what others say, 
  why would you leave all your friends and family, 
  spain, 
  the western powers are hypocrites wow you do n't say, 
  whaat, 
  that 's bullshit probably some danish `` meme '', 
  what ? 
  new york accent is nowhere near as dreadful as the california accent ( which is the worst accent of any language ever ), 
  still shoes innit, 
  well yea if guests in my country do n't take off their shoes they 'll get yelled at, 
  pretty sure it 's common in germany to wear shoes indoors, 
  probably the protests/marches on women 's days no rioting though , iirc, 
  sounds like a typical thing some dumb chinese person would say, 
  not a continent = / = * just * a peninsula, 
  is this supposed to be a joke ? 
  this is an incredibly odd incredibly specific question, 
  we pretty much had to choose between german , french and spanish ; i went with german i think this system has been changed sometime during the past 5 years though, 
  too wild of a difference for speculation to be useful or anywhere close to accurate, 
  their policy is n't aimed at neutrality , but avoiding conflict . 
  at the moment they can do this while neutral , but if situations change , they wo n't hesitate to form alliances, 
  it 's none of those things, 
  there 's more to a country than government investment plans, 
  the sources are n't really reliable . 
  like , even though he settles down in sweden rather than norway , the first named `` norwegian chieftain '' in the sagas is odin, 
  there is no good bread, 
  we seem to be pretty unique in europe in that we value independence and liberty , yea, 
  they changed the recipe and now it sucks, 
  a place, 
  it 's no secret that the majority of the population in crimea is russian i know that referendum was pretty bollocks , but a `` western styled '' referendum would yield similar result in the end , that referendum does n't matter that much, 
  they have literally annexed a part of ukraine that would rather be in russia, 
  i 've gotten more apathetic , but that 's more personal issues than anything that 's happened in the world i feel sort of like bitter about all these new leftists the last couple of years . 
  like `` i was in on this before it was cool '', 
  russia is more in the right than their opponents, 
  i would consider them as much immigrants as the poles and pakistanis, 
  i think a good comparison is like texan separatism, 
  president is a king-replacement, 
  nothing comes to mind even the vikings most people do n't really complain about, 
  there are liked immigrant/minority groups ? 
  edit : clarification : it seems to me people either hate them all or do n't care, 
  this is n't a thing here , mate, 
  this is a bloody english-speaking forum for christs sake, 
  `` ostracised by the rest of europe '', 
  trash, 
  that page is whack, 
  halden maybe preferably i 'd stay here in the `` region '' of * rome * * reich * though, 
  the aristocracy was disbanded several hundred years ago , long before the republican revolutions, 
   but consider the term `` standard \u00f8stnorsk '' which does n't exist, 
  i believe there are four major brands of protestantism in the entierty of europe . 
  these are lutheranism anglicanism calvinism zwinglianism for the most part , virtually all protestants in any given country belong to just one of these four branches, 
  the bishop of oslo is under some scrutiny because he 's pretty homophobic, 
  i 'd guess sami majority areas , but i dunno it might be \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433 lol, 
  i do n't drink coffee, 
  only greek guy i know is from thessaloniki , and that stereotype is hilariously accurate of him, 
  i do n't, 
  we do , idiot, 
  the reds probably have n't really researched nkp, 
  that 's the shortest way to describe it , yea, 
  dlf, 
  no , their attitude, 
  bergen, 
  i respect not a single one of them, 
  this is actually pretty spot-on, 
  the americans with norwegian ancestry seem to think that on some level make them norwegian , but they are n't, 
  `` soldiers of odin '' is a thing they do n't have much influence , and are more characterised by whining than violence , but i think such groups are on the rise , yes of course , most racism is exercised outside of these groups, 
  basically a country needs to have full control of its currency to be able to deal with for example a financial cricis of course , another way to work around this is to have a centrally controlled budget for all eurozone states , but adopting your own currency is easier, 
  have we talked about this before ? 
  i think i was arguing over this with a dutch guy not long ago , and if you 're the same dude i 'd rather not, 
  it 's objectively terrible, 
  liability so have we , though, 
  real blueberries are , but your fake blueberries are n't, 
  i think we should sever ties with them tbh also , the view that theyd assist us if anyone invaded is just whack trump has n't had ny impact on these views, 
  you 'd probably fair alright not sure how you 'd be able to land work or a place to live , but if you put your mind to it you should be able to do it, 
  there are like a million differences , too much to note not to mention that living in different parts within either country are vastly different from eachother as well, 
  some of them thousands of years some of them only a couple hundred, 
  man , the most dangerous game, 
  crack pipe theory that recognises the differences between people and political reality alright, 
   ok well i plenty of other scandinavians would have a thing or two to say about that . 
  plenty of other scandinavians are wrong,
