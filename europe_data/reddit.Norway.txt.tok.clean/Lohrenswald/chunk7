  there is no `` scandinavian culture '' for all i know denmark and sweden is more alligned with germany that britain , but norway is closer to britain, 
  norway is and has traditionally been alligned with british interests , and british culture and thought is prevalent, 
  for the most part i believe at least in norway you can like apply for a liscence to use these kinds of things for such explicit purposes, 
  i believe in many regards switzerland is part of `` german europe '' while at least norway is part of `` british europe '', 
  is root beer different from soda ? 
  no pan-scandinavianism is an ideology of idiots . 
  it died 150 years ago, 
  question was asked for r/askeurope , so i answered, 
  never heard of it, 
  personally i 've never met any there 's a lot of pakistanis here , but they 're muslim you know, 
   does your country have a lifestyle philosophy like swedish ` lagom ' , danish ` hygge ' , norwegian ` koselig ' , or finnish ` kalsarik\u00e4nnit ' ? 
  `` cozy '' is n't a lifestyle philosophy, 
  shit, 
  westland, 
  `` need '' is a strong word, 
  no , the term `` continentals '' is n't used for people living there , but the term `` the continent '' is often used, 
  some varangians were more varangian than others, 
  bread and some whatever on it pretty soulcrushing food i think, 
  he 's probably more famous in england than norway , i make no pretense he 'd be well known in italy on the other hand though i think he 's fairly famous in greece, 
  400 year night ( not really but still ), 
  as with the irish , it 's impossible to be a norwegian and not have relatives in america, 
  fewer than 50 i think and i think there are maybe 10 with it in sweden and nobody else in the rest of the world, 
   can you translate it ? 
  yes but i wo n't, 
  holocaust and hitler `` jokes '', 
  apparantly romania and norway use a slight variation , though i 'm very sure there 's no compability issues lol, 
   do n't really see why you specifically mention the east because if i did n't specify that 's where i 'm from , people from the rest of the country would whine about it, 
  it 's illegal to drink alcohol in public, 
  i mean i 'm pretty used to the lion iconography though it 's more a representation of the state than of the nation, 
  what stands out most in my mind is when i was taking the s-bahn in berlin ( might have been u-bahn , do n't recall fully ) i was seeing some dudes openly drink alcohol out of a bottle right there in the carridge, 
  coastal east do n't have cold winters anymore because of global warming, 
  no it is actually very important for a state to have control over its own currency greece currently has no means to regulate inflation/deflation ( much at least ), 
  fuck no, 
  i know one from online , he married some norwegian woman , and they moved here . 
  he seems mostly okay ( i.e. 
  not republican lol ), 
  personally i do n't think we have any reliable allies, 
  this would n't solve everything overnight , but it is abdolutely essential that they get rid of the euro and introduce their own currency, 
  if they visit the east they might be surorised by how not-cold it is i 'm sure there 's lots of other stuff , but i do n't know that much about foreigners ' pre-concieved notions, 
   from lisbon to moscow and oslo to athens , what would be the best languages to learn ? 
  portugese , russian , norwegian , greek, 
  it happens all the time, 
  i can understand swedish , danish , german and english , that does n't make those the same language, 
  germany i think , especially saarland, 
  most norwegians do n't even know we did, 
   myself i would be kind of offended if a swede spoke to me in english mate you have plenty of oppurtunity to be offended people are probably better at trying to avoid english at the border areas , but go to for example stockholm and you 'll find no shortage of people who 'll speak english to you, 
  no we do n't, 
  i 'd like to have it end, 
  english is often used, 
  thundershield, 
  it 's called `` yes we love this country '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ja,_vi_elsker_dette_landet, 
  i can tell you i 'd much prefer it if you were the one having to talk a different language than me having to do it, 
  some do, 
  because tourism is bad, 
  so you need the euro becuase you are inept at economics , is what you 're getting at, 
  talk about false choice, 
  you know what else is resilient to financial crisis socialism, 
  that 's a problem you 'd ought to fix, 
  you do n't seem to have that great understanding of how the economy works most eurozone countries would be able to provide better services for their populations by abandoning the euro , than relying on tourism spending, 
  italy and spain do n't need tourism to exist neither does norway need the petroleum export ( which is mainly gas and very little oil , btw ), 
  why would you want to not hurt the tourism economy, 
  there 's a flag, 
  can you not see my flair it 's ~ ~ norway ~ ~ norge, 
  i 've got mixed feelings paragraph 2 for example i do n't really like , but i also have to admit that article having been reformed was necessary and the change is for the better paragraph 3 and for a long time onward is about what the king can , ca n't and have to do etc. , so i 've never been terribly inclined to read far into it , but i know that paragraph 100 is the one about freedom of expression ( a more general and better term than `` freedom of speech '' ) , which has a very troublesome wording : `` there should be freedom of expression '' should be , instead of like have to be , shall be , or is, 
  gone, 
   i know most of you have a celebration for the ruling monarchy and a patron 's day we do n't though anyway we probably celebrate our national day more than most countries ( including america ), 
  mandatory in child school, 
   i feel they all have a very strongly nordic identity together no, 
   do mps have to give up their seats when they become ministers ? 
  yes well kinda basically as long as they are in the government , they have to let a vararepresentative hold their mandate, 
  buildings are grosser than for example trees anyway i 'm tired of you ; do n't reply to this comment, 
  nature, 
  i think cities generally are ugly, 
  u kno, 
  that 's a super lame positivist mindset if the only thing you care about is like `` efficiency '' then go to bed, 
  none, 
  only one that comes to mind is `` svenskefaen '' , which technically means swedish devil , but it carries more the connotations of `` little piece of shit '', 
  this guy ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_i._hagen i suppose that 's true , but he 's not very relevant anymore lol, 
  i think there are a few , but it 's super rare, 
  right-wingers do n't like say `` tax is theft '' or anything , but they always complain that it 's too high, 
  not even in the sligthest, 
  not particularly one thing is that it seems to me that the rule is that if a noun is in plural , sometimes an adjective in front of it get a plural ending as well , and sometimes not i think i think most people pretty much always do that plural adjective thing all in all , the `` language council '' actually does a rather good and very active job to fit the normative rules to how people actually talk, 
  went to oslo a couple of times, 
  they sell them in stores , so people buy them, 
  in norway we actually call the country hellas ( though we still say `` gresk '' for the adjective ) i 'm not sure when or why it fell out of fashion to say `` grekenland '' here, 
  it seems to me english speakers often mix up the two ch-sounds in german, 
  skj is easy , kj is the tough one it also seems to me that our o - and y-sounds do n't exist in english, 
  yea i 'd say so i got my first english lessons in shcool in third grade , when i was 8, 
  wow i 've never reflected on this i 'm like the guy you describe, 
  til , eller : idlj, 
  how specific do you want to hear, 
  norway scandinavia, 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/galdh%c3%b8piggenfromfannar%c3%a5ki.jpg went to the top of that mountain in 2007 , when i was like 12, 
  i was a kid at a place i did n't really want to be, 
  true, 
  got some in sweden saw them once , did n't talk to them, 
   i thought it was an amicable separation that 's a false image that 's been constructed long after the dissolution , probably to sort of `` sell the image '' that scandinavia ( and especially sweden , i 'd think ) has been a peaceful place for centuries , but it 's pretty much a miracle that there was no war between norway and sweden of course , the majority ( maybe not vast majority , but the majority nonetheless ) of the political elite in both countries hoped to resolve it peacefully , but notably the norwegians were anticipating war if it would come to that . 
  there was a lot of call to war in sweden too , but again , the majority of the political elite wanted to avoid that, 
  you 're right , i did n't really think of that maybe we should , on this subreddit , enchourage people asking questions to explain if they come from a position like that , and likewise enchourage the answerers to take that in mind and be polite in those circumstances,
