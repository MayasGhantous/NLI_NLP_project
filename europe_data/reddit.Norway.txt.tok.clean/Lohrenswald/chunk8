  people did n't care about the consequenses for breaking the union , and most people ( on both sides ) anticipated war lots of people here were severly disapointed there was n't a war , actually, 
  we pronounce it like : hahvai, 
  1905 the reckless pursuit of freedom is sort of inspiring though the most interesting is probably the civil war era, 
  i get a perception that many of those questions involve the americans wording in a stupid way , that even seems like they know is stupid , and that they already somewhat know the answer to their questions , but they ask anyway on the other hand , the downvoting trend that baffles me is that any question about travel advice seems to get downvoted, 
  nope, 
  i do n't , but my mother has travelled there many times and spoken a bit about it apparantly the sami do n't hold ( all of the ) similar cultural values , though that 's not neccesarily a bad thing . 
  like , one example is that norwegians tend to hold pride in having a well-kept house , while the sami kinda do n't give a shit about that there is much tension between the norwegians up there and the sami it seems . 
  alcoholism and violence at least used to be pretty prevalent among the sami apparantly , but like , not organised towards norwegians or anything . 
  and apparantly most of the norwegians that live near samis are actually very racist towards them . 
  `` you ca n't trust those people '' and so forth . 
  but a thing to note is that forceful `` assimilation '' , norwegification and erasure of culture , and i think even some meassure of eugenics programmes , was official public policy i think a fair bit into the 1980 's also just one thing i 'd like to note is that reindeer herding is not a traditional sami way of life . 
  their traditional lifestyle was to hunt wild reindeer , but in the face of `` colonisation '' , they had to change their ways of life, 
  yes we do also , japan at least are doing better than us , so your zinger is stupid, 
  surely the basques were n't subject to eugenics programs, 
  a more apt comparison for the sami are the native americans, 
  fuck our exports, 
  we should leave like yesterday, 
  yea  also , why would you choose such a thing over marriage ? 
  marriage is just that plus an expensive ceremony, 
  fuck no, 
  the local city square is called `` the turf '' officially , not just colloquially [ sic ], 
  it 's all rip-offs of foreign stuff , unfourtunately, 
  solidox and colgate are the only two brands i 've ever seen, 
  it came from people , like any other language that there is n't any other language that 's very similar to it , does n't mean there 's anything special to its origin, 
  my least favourite thing is the highrise construction my most favourite thing is that almost all my family and friends are here ( not very special , but there it is ), 
  it 'd probably someplace only maybe 5 or 10 % of the population would know about perhaps even less, 
  we do n't have any special relations with ghana , india or america lol, 
  i do n't think it 's impossible , i jusy think it would be bad, 
  i do n't think these kinds of divisions were discussed much in school personal view : http://i.imgur.com/emwm1tn.png http://i.imgur.com/1ev0pvs.png, 
  kinda , yea but it 's more about the culture and whatnot . 
  individual americans are n't at fault for that , and i 'm okay with most of them, 
  southerners outnumber the northerners like 10 or 20 to 1 northerners swear a lot the `` aboriginal '' sami are in the north , but they 're pretty distinct from the norwegians there northerners are more socialist it seems , the communists held far more offices there , and far longer too, 
  stupid term imo to answer the question i do n't think people care much ( also notably a lot of students attend `` high schools '' rather than universities lol ) in my university i 've seen a few people like wear shirts related to student organisations for certain institutes , but nothing for the university itself, 
  i 'm pretty sure america is the only country in the world where this is something people care about, 
  the laws are much stricter than what is usually reality like , you can be criminally prosecuted to call someone a `` whore '' , but most of the time people just let that slip without pressing charges ( even when people feel genuinely hurt ), 
  spain, 
  taco, 
  i 've never assessed trustworthiness of anyone it 's not something i care about or ever is relevant to me, 
  unions are bad do n't form any, 
  in my opinion , studying abroad for anyone has never been a good investment for the future, 
  mine, 
  most contemporary european culture is hostile to social democracy already so living in europe is probably more likely to make people abandon social democracy , and not embrace it, 
  there are countries where people rather would live in apartments than houses ? 
  well you know eurasia is actually a continent , so yea, 
  thanks !, 
  i mean anyone can , but sometimes it 's out of the blue the issue is n't about who 's allowed to do it , but just who even bothers, 
  asking how i 'm doing when you 're not actually interested, 
  proper forest areal, 
  what 's uht ? 
  the problem with modern republics is that they usually feel the need to give vast executive powers to an office held by one individual . 
  the president is pretty much an elected king . 
  the kind of irony is that if the king is a king , he is sort of shamed into not using these , tbqf , undemocratic powers , but if he is called a president instead , he will feel justified in using them . 
  i saw some days ago a video from before the election in britain . 
  jeremy corbyn was `` grilled '' by some tv guy about the labour party 's manifesto . 
  he complained there was nothing about abolishing the monarchy , and one of corbyn 's retorts was that the manifesto was filled with things that matters . 
  and that 's the key the conflict about monarchy vs. republicanism without changing the rest of society just does n't matter, 
  our happiness to welfare ratio is somewhat low, 
  i looked it up , and american citizens are n't allowed to renounce their citizenship unless they have ( or get ) citzenship in another country, 
  i do n't particularily like it . 
  i think all foreign state citizens should go to the same process to aquire citizenship however i 'm open to loosening that process up a bit . 
  currently you have to live here for many years before you get citizenship, 
  the president is officially the # 2 highest position in the country , after the king the king is head of the executive branch , and the president head of the legislative , so i do n't think they meet that often lol, 
  germannic people came to the southern part of scandinavia while the northern part was still unpopulated and covered in glaciers . 
  however , the sami came from the east , and settled in the northern part before the germannic people visited there so like , saying `` scandinavia '' does n't really help , because the different part was settled at different times does that make sense ? 
  i 'm not sure i explained very well, 
  there are only a very few scattered areas where they 're the majority of the population sami independence is about as feasable , probably less , as native american independance, 
  the president is kind of amusing in that he exist, 
  right now nothing tbh , i 've had three very bad semesters in a row i 'm kinda scared i might have to redo some courses ( even some i 've passed ) and just thinking about it makes me want to die, 
  i was n't talking about you also the melody of your nat song is a lot younger, 
  how old is old ? 
  most national songs are less than 200 years old, 
  do n't think i 've actually met any turks i 've met a number of arabs and pakistanis , but no turks to my recollection, 
  not everything liberal is neoliberal , but the eu is, 
  italian from experience and hearsay i think italian `` catering '' is better than greek also , venice is like a historically preserved city , while athens is mostly a modern and unpleasant city , not really worth visiting, 
  for most politicians i disagree with the things they explicitly say , so whether or not they live up to what they say is usually not something i care about, 
  norway does n't even build houses like denmark , or have similar climate or similar stances on topics like the relationship of welfare to the individual as denmark , and danish and norwegian is almost mutually unintelligeble edit : also , i have actually been to schleswig-holstein . 
  it might be a little bit like denmark , but it 's not at all like norway, 
  then you need to work on your reading comprehension, 
  too hot during the summer it used to be too cold during the winter , but global warming changed that during the past 3 years or so, 
  neoliberalism that has stolen the hearts of millions through deception, 
  very , i suppose i hate it, 
  walking out in an orderly fashion in case of fire, 
  i know i have relatives in sweden , and i know of at least one specific swedish great-great-great-grandfather ( i believe it was ) , but i feel it 's stupid to not just say i 'm all norwegian, 
  i 'd say the settlements of iceland , greenland and amerika was migrations rather than colonisation , but it 's kinda iffy i guess i was thinking more of the colonisation process after 1500 or so, 
  we are n't really thought about those note , that roald amundsen 's expedition to the south pole , which we are thaught about , actually went across what would become your antarctic territory , and not ours edit : also just to be clear , with `` nothing '' i was saying not that we did n't have colonies , but that we ar n't taught about them . 
  we had colonies in the caribean , and outposts in ghana and india, 
  nothing, 
  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, 
  but of course you do, 
  no , but a county 's borders are where they are , so what places counts within and what 's outside is n't something unclear, 
  except norway is actually a country , it 's not arbitrary at all, 
  right-wingers do , yes, 
  mine is , but i do n't know about other young people in this country note though that in greece it 's way way worse than in america, 
  choson, 
  and i am telling you that you do n't, 
  `` europe '' does n't even make sense as a geographical thing neither does asia , if you see where i 'm going, 
  there is no such thing as `` scandinavian feel '', 
   basically the southwest southeast, 
  is brass music like a big part of serbian culture lol or, 
  none comes to mind besides universities , but they 're kinda tupid,
