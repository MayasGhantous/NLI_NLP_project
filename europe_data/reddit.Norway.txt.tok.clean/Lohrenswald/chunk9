  i 'm tired of you on the first point you 're wrong , on the second you 're right , but you keep arguing about that one as if i 'm contradicting you somehow i wo n't respond to your next comment, 
  i really do n't know how to quantify it i guess i should try to find out more , but i think i know more than most people most interesting thing i think is when they decided a dead guy was going to be king forever, 
  the quality of the roads, 
   true no  since there 's no objective authority for the language in general , on which we seem to agree , there 's literally no way to claim that an expression is wrong , if it 's actually used by the people en masse . 
  yes , but this is axactly what the oxford dictionary is doing, 
   things like out social security net the idea of europe is so much older than social security that pretending they are connected is kinda stupid  the way we define freedom in contrast to how the americans do it , and so on i feel like norway is a lot more similar to america than germany, 
   well , considering english is the single most impossible-to-objectively-prescribe-for language on the planet untrue  i 'd say that there 's literally not a single arbiter of truth that everybody can accept precisely , and that 's exactly why people acting as if the oxford dictionary is is a problem, 
  you 're probably right about those two now that i think about it ( except i still think germany is at least a little bit more in favour than those , but not very ), 
  it 's reputation for normative authority is ill-suited for the real world and for common arguments , not to mention that this reputation is completely undeserved, 
  well i mean we killed quisling , who was nowhere near as bad as hitler , so, 
  one part of me says sweden , another says russia, 
  nato wars are n't spoken of at all ww2 we were clearly on the better side war of independence was , you know , justified wars under danish rule we blame them for any other wars were over 600 years ago , so now they really are n't relevant, 
  they 're not pro-eu like the germans are edit : this is not some kind of stupid `` 4th reich '' argument i 'm trying to put forth here , btw , just to be clear, 
  overthrowing imperialists and capitalists and all that wankery, 
  i think the idea of `` individuality '' has been fetishised and corrupted to such an extent it should n't be used to describe a good world to live in, 
  yea but most peopole care about eu and do n't give two shits about the european council, 
  i agree, 
   oxford dictionaries have the european union as one of the meanings of europe yea but oxford dictionaries are garbage it 's also you know , a bloody dictionary and not the arbiter of truth, 
  i get rather mad though frankly i think the term `` europe '' should be put to rest . 
  there 's nothing norway intrinsically has in common with france or albania that is n't also shared with the rest of the world, 
  we 're the bad guys, 
  germany is the only really very pro-eu country, 
  i dunno like oslo here is very larger than other cities ( at least here on the eastland ) , and like , i do n't think it 's ** that ** dense , but a bit i suppose i live in what i 'd personally call a mid-sized city , which is n't very dense , i do n't think . 
  there are some blocks , but they are scattered about a bit , and next to fairly large like outside ares ( not exactly parks , but i ca n't find a better word for it ), 
  plenty of brutal wars has been fought under many flags , this one is n't worth specific attention contrast with the swastika flag , based on intense hatred way before the movement that used it ever got into war, 
  by being intensely negative, 
  1700 's we had europe 's largest army in relation to population actually with norway there is a lot of `` most x per capita '' lol, 
  sami people were `` pagans '' centuries after lithuania became christian, 
  my czech friend gets kinda upset by it as he says , czechia and its culture is closer to germany than for example russia, 
  i wish i had an air conditioner, 
  vast majority, 
   in principle , i think a hereditary monarchy is undemocratic this is what i think about this basically all modern democracies for some reason insist on having a pretty undemocratic element , a single individual who holds vast executive powers this is either a monarch or a president and , when this person is a monarch , he is kinda `` shamed '' into not using these powers , while for a president this is considered okay for some reason so paradoxically i believe modern monarchies de facto are better democracies than modern republics, 
  king is pretty wholesome model king of this age , tbh crown prince seems a bit too much of a try-hard pr business person unfourtunately, 
  woa a downvote kinda wonder why, 
  should probably have natives do those jobs instead , because this is n't leading anywhere good ( with like an unable population i mean , not `` oh noez the foreigners '' ), 
  it lead to like economic catastrophy here , but you know , still not worthy of any type of marking, 
  well the fire hazards were due to the type of politics she represents, 
  some people like to note how like the 1800 's and 1900 's were the unusual times , and china is now simply getting back to it 's usual business as leading economy and whatnot and like , america has basically already destroyed everything norway was , so having china become `` world leader '' wo n't lead to any greater loss wish they 'd be more communistic tho, 
  the racism, 
  bernie sanders is fairly liked at least in western europe i think, 
  racists, 
  not in norway, 
  meal is much more enjoyable if you do n't have to go get refills all the time i dunno about the rest of europe , but norway is n't like what you describe ( at least not when you 're at a fast-food chain instead of a proper restaurant ), 
  i do n't listen to rap, 
  no thanks lol, 
  translated the name of a nearby town into german thought it sounded neat and went for it it was originally supposed to be l\u00f6hrenswald , but the first site i registered on did n't allow tr\u00e9ma , which looking bask i 'm glad i ditched, 
  maybe ? 
  https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3250/2339480145_c59cb7beed_b.jpg though i bet seeing it covered in snow during the winter would n't bat an eye, 
  looks unremarkable to me , but i might be `` biased '', 
  ai n't nobody got time to hang around for refills, 
  sami culture gets like protection i think norwegian does n't and i think our culture is already dead #edgy, 
  i have n't been to america , but i have discussed this online so aparantly what you do in america is fill the glass/cup with ice , and then fill the gaps between with the drink this is stupid , because i am paying for a drink , i do n't want frozen water, 
  had german at school , but it 's gotten kinda rusty made me a little bit able to understand some dutch though ( mostly written rather than spoken ) so generously i 'd say 6, 
  about 20 km , a bit more i think most of the distance is travelled by train however it takes at least 50 minutes to go just one way, 
  wikipedia says there are only 770 jews in the entire country . 
  i do n't think i 've met any , but i know the synagogue in oslo ( one of two in the country ) has been shot at , and you can see here : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/synagogue%2c_oslo_02.jpg there 's barricades in the road so that cars ca n't drive there , as a security meassure, 
  they should be independent it 's just that they 're afraid to dream of freedom, 
  it 's fairly close to that yea , but it 's on the norwegian side of * the * * iddefjord * if you know where that is, 
  i do n't know and i 'm afraid i 've said more than i had reason to, 
  worst leader was king oscar ii who lost the country, 
  my family has like a `` summer cottage '' down south near the border we go to every year, 
  rar in swedish means cute , while in norwegian it means strange m\u00e5 means in danish can ( as in to be allowed to ) and in norwegian it means must ( as in you have to , it 's cumpulsory ) bolle in norwegian means bowl ( and is also the name of a common like bakery product ) while it in danish means like `` pussy '' as in vagina, 
   sj\u00f6 ( sea ) means lake you do n't call lakes innsj\u00f8 ? 
  cry, 
  them getting into government 4 years ago has meant a lot more than anything related to britain or america, 
  well since we are on semantics now , i wake up before i drink anything, 
  as far as i know there 's nothing that warrants painting both of them with one stroke, 
  i generally do n't, 
  or norway , if i have to pick one, 
  all of them, 
  dunno , do n't think so of course , the nobility here was disbanded like 500 years ago or something, 
  dunno much about it but the `` industry '' seems to be pretty fucked up like it 's not just that america is good at it and europe not , there 's all kinds of shit about having to move to san fransisco and whatnot, 
  the blasphemy ban was removed when the crime laws were changed in 2005 , but this change did n't go into effect until 2015 so blasphemy became legal 2 years ago, 
  local cities with their own laws ? 
  hamburg and bremen are still their own states , so hanse basically exists still, 
  since like the 30 's , all the new reforms have been shit, 
  well you know if they 're muslim some people get `` scared '' , others are like `` that 's his views and i respect them '' deeply religious christians i think are viewed with more ridicule , but i have n't encountered many of those myself ( they do exist though ), 
  dunno what you mean by `` personhood '' , but most ( well at least a lot of ) animals are thinking beings with feelings , and we should treat them nicer, 
  we 're actually pretty full of ourself for being the best country in the world # 1 on human development index etc. 
  felt like asking on a page i 'm familiar with, 
  i mean it 's technically a form of democracy , so that 's kinda nice i guess, 
   preferable if they are n't directed by mel gibson . 
  super agree for all historical movies maybe even all movies in general edit : unfourtunate double post , fixed 2 hours later, 
  a lot of the sagas could work i guess ( violent conflict not rich in nuance , fits well with how hollywood handles historic stuff ) , though the royal sagas are kinda a very long story , as is the civil war era , and most of the sagas about non-royal individuals are about icelanders , which i guess could disqualify it . 
  since hollywood is american , they would probably spin any movie about roald amundsen to paint him in negative light and focus on `` how heroic '' scott was or whatnot . 
  the events of 1814 could work , it 's fairly analogus to america 1776 not much else springs to mind . 
  i 'm fairly certain good movies could be made by a lot from our history , but not by hollywood, 
  do you mean `` your '' as in mine or ours ( the country 's ) ? 
  strange ? 
  it has happened , but not in many years i think i think politics is taken more seriously here , so to say, 
  not really, 
  i think they 're smarter than trying, 
  i choose country a country b presumably does n't have a functioning sewer or water system , and this is too essential, 
  they would n't, 
  i 'm pretty sure this is like mandated parctice in judaism and islam , but i 'd make it illegal anyway unfourtunately it 's still legal it 's quite clearly a breach of the hippocratic oath , which is a principle worth far more than religions edit : said illegal when i meant to say legal, 
  so i 'm native , but i figured i 'd comment because both of my two best friends are `` second generation immigrants '' from czechia and china ( prc ), 
  personally i do n't hear much about her , but in general big celebreties in america are big celebreties here too ( at least in western euorpe , i 'd say ), 
  israel should never had been founded i think the ideal solution is a one-state palestine with majority jewish regions having meaningful autonomy, 
  world 93 % 11:48 there 's a couple there i straight up missed because the map was small and the mouse cursor finnicky , but i 've never been good at knowing all the island nations america 100 % 1:32 super easy , especially without the tiny circles like you get on the other two tests, 
  it would be bad if people pretended the occupation of norway was somehow inherently worse than the occupasion of poland yet this is how the conquest of the baltic states is treated,
