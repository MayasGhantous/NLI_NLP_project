this is so sad it 's hilarious . 
  huh , you are right , when you say it like that it sounds more like fearmongering and clickbait than an actual threat !, 
  thanks , reassuring to know it is n't anything out of the ordinary . 
  my mistake then . 
  similar names . 
  more like the democrat version of fox , the way i have been explained it , but not very different . 
  you got ta admit that liberating doggerland from doggerbank would be pretty rad , though . 
  aaah , spending more money while lowering taxes . 
  antarctica is empty , too . 
  both are about as useful as farmland : /, 
  great idea !, 
  let 's offer them cheap farmland west of ... wait , shit . 
  perhaps netherlands can help ? 
  since the most far right party ( frp ) is in a coaliation goverment with some other parties , stuff gets entertaining . 
  particularily with the extra immigrants from the various conflict areas that are a hot topic of debate . 
  basically , the party have said yes to whatever their regjering-partners have told them , but are going around telling the mayors who are members of their party to refuse to accept more immigrants . 
  fun thing is that forementioned mayors refuse to do that . 
  wo n't do anything if they do n't have a way to enforce it . 
  and the countries who lack a goverment strong enough to enforce it , tend to be the ones with bad enough conditions that prompts people to get lots of children . 
  ## norway : say yes to the imigrants , while telling the municipality mayors from your party to turn them away . 
  at least , that is what a certain right wing party in the regjering is trying to.you fulfill your commitment to the goverment cooperation , while avoiding actually accepting the immigrants !, 
  win win !, 
  fun thing is that their mayors do n't want to . 
  does n't mean much . 
  the eu is n't one country . 
  as was said last time this was reposted , he only travels to and from london once a week . 
  they did , but the us and the uk had a bit of a falling out a while ago . 
  and you ** dare ** thinking of denying them their right to bear arms ? 
  what are you , some kind of *** socialist *** ? 
  noooo everything but that d :, 
  hopefully both cases are just troublemakers that did n't think it through . 
  i guess what we learn from this is that knives are op and grenades need a buff . 
  the current explaination is that he garried a starting pistol to `` feel safe '' , then accidentally fired it , damaging himself in the process . 
  he claimed he had been attacked and shot to cover up the starting pistol , as he was afraid of losing his job . 
  does n't explain the bomb , though . 
  currently the main suspect , and he is detained by the police and being questioned . 
  the police have n't come to a conclution yet , though . 
  ** norway : ** a security guard was shot , and a bomb , which later turned out to be fake , discovered at the university in oslo . 
  the twist ? 
  the security guard had shot himself by accident ( starter gun , not allowed to carry that ) , and planted the fake bomb himself . 
  like i said before , one of our many crime fiction authors must be leaking . 
  iirc you panicked after france got defeated , and pulled out . 
  we did n't trust you with our gold , though :p, 
  what do you mean ? 
  you did `` invade '' , and on the second try in narvik you even put up a good fight . 
  retreated after that though , sone say unecessarily . 
  sadly , they do not handle temperate climate well . 
  their behaviour are pretty dependent on stable access to flowers and other food , which causes them to handle winters much worse than regular honey bees . 
  at least , that is what the wiki claims . 
  they are more suited for tropical climates , not european winters :(, 
  ca n't find the article mentioning it , though . 
  when waa that changed ? 
  been a few years since i last heard esperanto mentioned . 
  did the council give up ? 
  this is another common argument ** against ** esperanto , though . 
  it is a very eurocentric language , and harder for non-europeans to learn . 
  one reason is that like other artificial languages , it is a dead language . 
  few know it , few learn it , and few use it . 
  you are not even allowed to make new words , artificially hamstringing it , further digging its grave . 
  it is also basically spanish too , just look at it . 
  why esperanto , and not interlingua , by the way ? 
  depends on the definition . 
  western/eastern europe are sometimes used to separate former warsaw pact countries , and the others . 
  no way to know what op was thinking , though . 
  you were downvoted because : 1 . 
  he was not wearing a bulletproof vest . 
  guards patrolling there had been wearing said west for almost a year , because of an earlier incident . 
  must admit that i am mostly regurgilating comments made by the norwegian air force . 
  they are extremely enthusiastic about the new planes , saying it will easily do missions an f-16 would consider suicide , but the only specific situation they mention are attacks on missile ramps , where a small formation of f-35s will do a job where f-16s would require support by awacs , refuelling planes and jamming planes . 
  schlengen/swexit , abolish the euro , deport all foreigners , colonize finland , vanquish denmark , then conquer russia to kickstart swedens return to being a superpower . 
  that should cover most of it . 
  more practically though , it will be nice nice to have the option of operating without awac being airborne and following . 
  nice stereotype , dude . 
  your soapbox looks good , too . 
  what a twist . 
  i think some of our ~ ~ criminal literature ~ ~ crime fiction writers are leaking . 
  not to mention , the f22 is n't being exported . 
  most importantly , it massively outperforms the f16 in the `` not being permanently grounded due to ancient airframes that are disintegrating due to metal fatigue '' characteristic . 
  ### ** plot twist ** security guard suspected of planting the fake bomb and shooting himself . 
  police have detained him , and he is being questioned . 
  ** update : ** pst , basically the norwegian mi5 , has announced that they see nothing that implies that this event are connected to any extremist or terrorist activities . 
  you might be surprised to know that people want to improve their living standard despite having it better than someone else in the world . 
  people are also not 100 % rational , and sometimes make bad decisions . 
  that is how you get ~ ~ ants ~ ~ rebels . 
  oh , i do n't know , lack of personal freedom , particularily in travel , or the ability to contact others at will , lack of luxuries like tobacco or other drugs ... 
  hey !, 
  it worked in tropico !, 
  might wan na legalize same-sex marrages to balance out the hate from those intellectuals , though . 
  more citizens , and the religious and the intellectuals balances out at `` okay with your rule '' !, 
  a dictatorship pretending to be a democracy with heavy use of brainwashing , of course . 
  arbeiderpartiet ( the labour party ( the party who have held the majority power in the goverment for quite some time through different political alliances ) ) are traitors who are collaborating with the muslims to eradicate norvegian ( and western ) culture and establish [ eurabia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurabia ) usual conspiracy theory bullshit , but sadly he was not content with being an internet tough guy . 
  obviously they just cloned his body . 
  superior oil-infused free healthcare , duh . 
  yup . 
  that does n't mean he is completely fine , though , just that he is mentally sound enough to be accountable to his actions , thus in a condition to serve a regular prison sentence . 
  well , he was almost declared legally insane ... 
  he had a lot of misconseptions about how a country works , amongst many other things . 
  was not a bulletproof vest , it was a protective vest that was intended against stabbing . 
  when a vest is heavy-duty enough to stop a knife , though , some resistance to firearms are implied .
