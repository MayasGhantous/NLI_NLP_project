  was not a bulletproof vest , it was a protective vest that was intended against stabbing . 
  when a vest is heavy-duty enough to stop a knife , though , some resistance to firearms are implied . 
  yes , from his cell , still in solitary confinement . 
  good if he learns how a state really works , as opposed to his fantasy whener he would face war trials and tried and be executed as a soldier and martyr for the glorious knight templars order . 
  update @ 12:37 : it was not a bomb , just something that looked like a bomb . 
  * edit : * some exepts from the press conference : bomb was a hoax , and the object is currently being investigated . 
  the security guard was lightly wounded after being hit . 
  ( fyi , `` lightly wounded '' just means he is n't dead or dying . ), 
  ** update : ** the security guard was hit by `` four to five '' projectiles , one who hit him in the chest , but failed to penetrate the protective west . 
  ( as others have said , the security guards patrolling around that school are wearing protective wests because of a stabbing incident about a year ago . 
  this is not a bulletproof vest , although it does provide some protection against firearms . ), 
  he was also shot by a 22 caliber pistol . 
  ** update2 : ** pst , basically the norwegian mi5 , has announced that they see nothing that implies that this event are connected to any extremist or terrorist activities . 
  ** update3 : ** security guard suspected of planting the fake bomb and shooting himself . 
  police have detained him , and he is being questioned . 
  update @ 12:37 : it was not a bomb , just something that looked like a bomb . 
   ** greek pmi broke all records ** wohoo !, 
   ** and sank to an all-time low of 30.2 . 
  ** aaaw , shucks . 
  so the lesson is , have such a small economy , and be so unimportant that others do n't bother dealing with you ? 
  you are mistaken , just ask over at / r/nordvei / !, 
  they do n't have the excuse of an undemocratic electoral system , though : / the problems are with the execution . 
  no , but they did pressurize a plane to simulate the conditions a plane experiences at 7000 + feet , and they did shoot with firearms of multiple calibers . 
  the point is that the holes a bullet makes are too small to cause an explosive decompression . 
  you need a grenade or similar . 
  if the main gun is disabled , what is the point of a tank then ? 
  besides , try getting some stingers or weaponized drones . 
  `` well regulated millitia '' my arse . 
  mythbusters covered that . 
  you would need a bomb to cause an explosive decompression . 
  bullet holes wo n't be enough . 
  they are n't even allowed to own tanks or nuclear weapons . 
  go hard or go home . 
  thus fucking up congress even more !, 
  i love it !, 
  ooh !, 
  just split up the entire united kingdom for maximum havoc !, 
  not in common speech , anyhow . 
  what about them ? 
  you surely do n't believe that more murders will magically bring them back ? 
  they were at a political youth camp . 
  if we let a * terrorist * scare us into changing the way the justice system works , then breivik has won , * and we have thrown away the very principles hundreds of teens gathered to celebrate . 
  * after all , his goal was to die a martyr at the hands of the evil goverment in his extremely confused view of the world . 
  i 'm not sure how law is handled in the uk , but one of the most basic principles of the norwegian state of law is that ** everyone ** is equal to the law , thus everyone gets the same treatment and rights . 
  without that we might as well reinstitute holmgang . 
  perhaps he could learn how a a nation actually works . 
  he seemed to have quite a few misconseptions during his trials . 
  do n't make us send [ nordthug ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nordvei/ ) to mess you up again . 
  you got it the wrong way around !, 
  jemtland og herjedalen are ours , and we are coming for them !, 
  just a fyi that dropped into my head , beredskapstroppen is pretty much the equavilent of the portugese grupo de opera\u00e7\u00f5es especiais . 
  those were the guys who apprehended breivik , not regular officers . 
  everyone knows the future is dogecoin . 
  i did not mention millitary . 
  and i am not sure what you expect a poor sod with a handgun to do against a guy in body armor and with automatic weapons . 
  regardless , if the point is to counter terrorism , then arming all officers has the wrong effect , as it causes fear among the population , which is a `` win '' for the ones using terror as a tool . 
  handguns would not do any good then . 
  it is not like the police have been replaced with emergency response troops ( beredskapstroppen/delta ), 
  hopefully the statistics wo n't change to much , despite the justice department deciding at the start of the year that police should be armed most of the time . 
  despite not being able to give a good reason for why . 
  or saying for how long . 
  shots fire - nevermind , the guns are at the station . 
   * why greece is n't the sole culprit for the crisis . 
  ### the kalmar union shall rise from its ashes , and reclaim its dominance of the new , larger kattegat sea, 
  yeah , the fools have no idea how many dank memes they have missed out on here at reddit . 
  when in doubt , wait a few months for the polandball . 
  well , first time have seen it abbervated . 
  thanks , did n't even consider it to be that , even with context . 
   wot world of tanks ? 
  only search result i find . 
  in hindsight ? 
  did the euro just collapse , or something ? 
  nothing about that on any news sites i can find . 
  err ... can i bring some friends from nato ? 
   who would attack us though ? 
  finland ? 
  or maybe norway jemtland og herjedalen are ours , and you know it !, 
  you might be operating on old news . 
  while parts of the new regjering wanted to spend more of the money going into the found , the others knocked the suggestion down , and kept the spending at regular levels . 
  that was about half a year ago though , iirc . 
  not sure what you mean , they seem to currently be slightly in the `` spend more money '' phase , but does n't seem to be doing much . 
  still , fun when the youngest party in the regjering discovered that you ca n't increase spending and lower taxes while not cutting any costs . 
  made for some interesting press conferences . 
  only that much you can do without getting more money coming in . 
  anyhow , not sure what you mean . 
  oh , i was n't thinking just greece , was thinking generally in politics . 
  as far as i know , most goverments tends to go back and forth between spending/investing/tax cuts and saving/increasing taxes . 
  behind a paywall , anyone got an alternative source ? 
  spending money sensibly is a hard concept to sell when things are going well : /, 
  joke or not , the guy who contributed with 5000 euros deserves a kudos for his commitment !, 
  even with special needs , . docx should be used instead . 
  if they did n't want to get invaded , they should n't have been flashing that sexy danzig corridor !, 
  perhaps the british negotionators were threatened to accept it with water guns ? 
  we shall build a wall of landsknechts !, 
  got ta pay for it ourselves , though . 
  checked tech tree , and yeah , unless you rush gunship asap you probably got modern infantry at the same time . 
  do n't underestimate winged anti-tank guns on the offensive by the sheer force of the inherited upgrades , though , 
  yeah , i forgot where in the tree infantry was . 
  sorry about that . 
  the initial way you commented made me assume you were a lot less level headed than you turned out .
