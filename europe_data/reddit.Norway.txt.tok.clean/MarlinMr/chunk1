but , norwegian is a modified version of danish , not old norse , right ? 
  [ here you go , any country you want ] ( https://www.google.no/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:nor:swe:fin&amp;hl=no&amp;dl=no#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:nor:swe:aut:che:lux:lie:fin:est:dnk&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=-294112800000&amp;tend=1409954400000&amp;hl=no&amp;dl=no&amp;ind=false ), 
  they do not have above-average . 
  students always have crap , because they simply have no money . 
  the average worker in norway is going to have far more than his own bathroom . 
  we have some of the highest wages in the world . 
  australia is the australia of europe, 
  nah , it wont make much difference . 
  sweden is not too concerned about russia invading their north . 
  why would they ? 
  there is only forest . 
  also russia is not even bordering sweden in the north ... 
  there is an entire country in-between ... norway however , is bordering russia and have valuable strategic coastline . 
  swedish forces are more to the south of the country . 
  also , doubling the forces that can face russia , does not really do much , we are still going to depend on the us and uk . 
  sweden joining nato will benefit the swedish the most , not norway or nato , but they will benefit too ofc . 
  correct , constitution prohibits banning norwegians from norway . 
  yet , there are not enough people who wants to , so some are being sent without having applied for it . 
  there is some debate going on about that . 
  how to convince prisoners ? 
  the reason norway does this , is because there is not enough space for prisoners in norway . 
  we also have old prisons that might not meet the quality you would want . 
  in some prisons , prisoners does not even have their own bathroom in their own cell . 
  this is something the prisoners will get in holland . 
  they will also be paid 30 nok ( ~ # 2.5 / $ 3 ) more , every day , than what they get at home . 
  there have been problems , for instance the prisoners did not have access to all the norwegian tv they should have access too , only the nrk ( norwegian bbc ) . 
  the biggest problem however is that it becomes hard to have visits from family or friends . 
  the nazi clearly took a stab back and thought to themselves `` this is the best idea ! '', 
  so basically everyone focuses on the beak , except brits and greek , they find the feet more puzzling ? 
   in a car crash is far more likely than being murdered , on either side of the pond . 
  yes it is , but there seems to be a higher rate of death vehicle accidents in the us than most of europe ... 
  : / that must feel worm in the summer, 
  so yes , you are in a desert ? 
  -17 in 90kmh winds is -35 in effective degrees, 
  it is a part of it , but it is more just trade in general , good ties to the uk and us , and the languages are similar . 
  same as netherlands . 
  weed . 
  or thousands of years of communication with the british . 
  its only a 2-5 day trip with a sail boat to england . 
  old english and old norwegian were quite similar , thus they are similar today too . 
  many words are even the same , but grammar is a bit different . 
  after the viking age , german/deutch languages became important . 
  they are still important . 
  german and norwegian is so similar , even someone with no german education can read and understand basic forms of communication . 
  german was the most important language in school due to trade . 
  then there was a war . 
  the royal family fled to england . 
  norwegian soldiers operated under british command . 
  we became bffs . 
  germany was occupying norway , so we were not that good friends for a while . 
  also there was no germany for awhile after the war . 
  english become more important . 
  1969 , oil is struck . 
  thousands of workers come from our other bff and nato partner , usa . 
  before this , the us culture and high living standards were sneaking in . 
  everyone wanted to be like the americans , they had refrigerator . 
  almost everyone who emigrated from norway in the 1900s moved to the us . 
  that created close ties . 
  the american oil workers forced people to learn english , but only a few places on the coast . 
  norwegian run operations started taking over the oil industry . 
  we learned the basics from the americans , but the best of-shore oil operations in the world is now run by the age old fishing country . 
  anyways , oil gave money . 
  better education . 
  what do we educate for ? 
  one reason is to build the future nation . 
  trade is important . 
  with the fall of germany , all of the sudden , uk and us become the biggest trade partners . 
  sweden and danmark are huge partners too , but swedish and danish is just a norwegian dialect , so no reason to teach it in school . 
  the world was also becoming smaller after the world , and the international trading language seemed to become english , so that is what was chosen . 
  now in the 2000s , the internet has come . 
  norway was the 2nd country to connect to the internet . 
  everyone has access to it . 
  good access too . 
  kids are exposed to english basically from birth ... 
  this we will see the effect of soon . 
  personally i was doing a lot of online gaming as a kid . 
  there are no `` norwegian servers '' . 
  no matter what game , it is in english . 
  tl ; dr : * english and norwegian are similar and have influenced each others for thousands of years , it is easy to learn . 
  * high standard of education with everyone attending school and learning english from an early age * imported culture from the us , no dubbing of movies and such . 
  bbc is part of standard tv channels . 
  * strong relationships to both the us and the uk * biggest trade partners ( uk ) speak english , and it is the global trading language * internet, 
  they speak british, 
  but many of the refugees up here in the north , are coming from russia . 
  and russian has roots with finish , right ? 
  do n't know about finland , but i 'm 22 and make 3000 $ a month . 
  finland is probably pretty similar to norway . 
  but ... 
  most of the refugees are not rooted in latin og germanic either ... right ? 
  no , just schengen . 
  uk is not part of schengen . 
  could still be problems there . 
  the fun thing is , this is not at night , but during day time . 
  every time i see sockets i think of this [ british socket video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uefp1okkz_q ), 
  immigrants . 
  also there are 700000 babies born every year , that is 1 % of the population . 
  they do n't know shit, 
  anyone know how it could affect norway ? 
  i know we are not in the eu , but are part of some huge trade agreements . 
  25 % of our exports are to the uk .
