  not much [ rabies in scandinavia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/rabies_free_countries_sourced_2010.svg/1280px-rabies_free_countries_sourced_2010.svg.png ), 
  i live ( a little bit ) further north and get the same amount of winter nights . 
  i have a good fiber connection to the internet and 4g on my phone , but if i walk for about an hour , i will be just as remote . 
  what is the name of this nearest village and town ? 
  i seriously doubt they are 280 km from the nearest town , considering the country is [ only 1000km long ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bceul6u.png ) . 
  that means they have to be 1/4 of the country away from the nearest town . 
  it would also require sweden , norway and russia to be without cities for huge areas . 
  those areas are populated ... [ image for scale ] ( http://imgur.com/qwcnont ) , 280km circle centred at sodankyl\u00e4 with a population of 8809 . 
  if that 's not a town , then what ? 
  [ some ] ( https://i.imgur.com/6go3kyn.png ) [ other ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xj8pllf.png ) [ distances ] ( https://i.imgur.com/zzuigds.png ) [ and one final image ] ( http://imgur.com/vojk3mx ) showing circles of 280km radius from alta , norway ( pop 14 000 ) . 
  and helsinki , finland with a population over half a million ... edit : if you define a town as having more than 150 000 inhabitants , [ than maybe they can hide away somewhere . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/yhbg7ua ) you can live remotely , but you cant get far away from civilication unless you are in a bigger country , like russia , canada , greenland or australia . 
  the poles also would work . 
  edit2 : so i read the picture , it said 180 miles ( more than 280km ) , and the title seemed to say [ inari , finland . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/2xjhbjp ) that circle has murmansk with 300 000 people within it . 
  the biggest cities of finnmark , norway : alta , kautokeino , kirkenes and vard\u00f8 . 
  and most importantly , i live only 190 miles from that place ... 
  i would have to drive trough loads of towns to get there . 
  [ this circle contains only about 10 000 people ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xxljjdi.png ) , but is only 100km in radius . 
  that means from the center , you can reach any part of the circle within 2-3 days of walking/skiing . 
  the farthest parts are less than 2hrs away with a car . 
  of course there are some parts that are further away because of no roads , water or mountains . 
  we are already all around you . 
  and there is no way of stopping thousands of people who simply want to have fun , when their fun consists of expanding . 
  there is nothing else to do there . 
  i would urge you guys to come up with a presentable solution for your flag . 
  right now , most of the norwegian userbase is concerned about the su stuff , however if it is removed , your flag is a natural next . 
  we did not `` delete '' we moved them . 
  we did that to greece too . 
  ehm , would the uk be able to take our oil if we joined the eu ? 
  its not like if we join the eu we all of the sudden lose our territorial claims . 
  why are there not tonnes of dutch oil rigs ? 
  now we would lose sovereignty over fishing . 
  and that is a big part . 
  not our problem . 
  also , we are not joining as long as the shared fishing is still there . 
  no thanks, 
  funny that the non volcanic are remote . 
  monarchy ftw !, 
  looks like sweden is pushing good here too . 
  i 'd say japan looks more impressive . 
  do you have some per capita maps ? 
  is frozen in norway too https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1598/24472450889_6a22fcab3e_o.jpg, 
  sweden is really pushing it with less than 10 million people, 
  do n't forget minecraft, 
  and the us would be green if it was russia, 
  it is really simple . 
  if it is not obvious , the germans ca n't claim it is fake anyhow . 
  no problem . 
  the problem is the huge number of easily obvious fake news . 
  facebook would quickly remove those, 
  no , only the oil we took from you , the rest of the north sea is ours . 
  that we took from the brits . 
  god jul ja . 
  we took it from you , deal with it . 
  perhaps we can trade it for greenland . 
  volcanoes do emit a lot , but do n't think it is included, 
  now make one with 90 % of the population living in oslo , bergen , kristiansand , trondheim and some other areas . 
  and 10 % for the rest, 
  yes , we are happy to sell you oil or gas . 
  i absolutely can not agree that cities outside the capital are no more beautiful than the american cities . 
  the relative small distances between european cities , compared to american , makes them easier to build and maintain . 
  also many cities are literally thousands of years old . 
  we have had time to make them good . 
  the only places i imagine are worse than bad american cities are places with less than 10 ' 000 people . 
  and even those places really are not as bad , simply because we do n't live in a desert , and the fact that there always is a larger city within a few hours of driving . 
  as an european , i recognise that many big cites in the us are quite well made and have ok transportation . 
  however these are huge cities . 
  many are bigger ( population wise ) than many european countries . 
  i also recognise that most of the country seem to suck . 
  the smaller places , which compared to my country would probably be big cities , just seam shitty . 
  i have never been there , but that is the way it is always shown . 
  flint michigan would be 4th biggest city in my country , so when we hear they do n't have water , it seems absurd . 
  a few days ago there were news stories about a community here without phone access . 
  it 's 2016 , how can this be ? 
  turns out the community is 3 houses on an island far from the cost that has no coverage . 
  when we are used to this , you ca n't blame us for looking at the us and say it is shitty , even if the big places are ok . 
  did iceland join the eu or switzerland ? 
  volcano, 
  no , it 's because it was february . 
  the sign clearly says november is the month ... 
   a lot of things . 
  poop , egg and sex . 
  not really a lot . 
   the eggs i buy regularly have things sticking to them , like straw or a feather . 
  the eggs i gather from the chickens in my backyard has poop on them . 
  oh you mean like how private channels spread republican propeganda in the us ? 
  yeah , its like the time the mossad killed a man in lillehammer norway . 
  i understand why they did it , but still shady . 
  protesting and civil disobedience is one thing . 
  what greenpeace does is something different . 
  they border ships and oil rigs . 
  and sink ships that they say are used for bad stuff . 
  they tried to sink a norwegian ship . 
  which is why the coast guard is so rough on them . 
  when you go from protesting and civil disobedience , to boarding ships and sinking them , you enter the realm of piracy . 
  which simply has to be delt with . 
  harsh . 
  [ here is a video of the sea shepherd ramming civilian ships ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxsrswseat8 ) [ here is a video of norwegian coast guard attacking them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhkkfolc5cg ) [ canadian coast guard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nuswtzvzza ) [ spanish navy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocoh7rrlrec ) they have also had confrontations with japanese and russians .
