norway -- absolutely nothing now that 's nonsensical . 
  you could get a couple hundred grams of a number of different vegetables for a dollar . 
  200g of champignon for example is about a dollar . 
  or you could buy an apple or banana or something . 
  you can even almost afford a can of beans . 
  it 'd also get you a bad cup of coffee , for that matter . 
  we basically [ tried to eliminate their culture and language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegianization ) . 
  plus they 're not a majority in anywhere near that large an area . 
  there 's far more ethnic norwegians than sami people in that area . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/languages_of_europe_map.png ) would be more accurate . 
  good point , though crime and so on is usually local to the poorer parts of society , so it does n't affect the rich as much ( though certainly still does to some extent ) . 
  i guess it depends on what you prioritize whether the richest few are better off or not . 
  economic homogeneity does n't mean complete economic equality . 
  there are still rich and less rich people , it is just that the gap is smaller , especially on the poorer end . 
  poverty is virtually non-existent in the nordics with the exception of some immigrants . 
  there is still significant incentives to succeed in the nordics . 
  the highest marginal rate in norway for example is 48 % , which means that you still keep half of your increasing success . 
  so one can still become extremely rich . 
  denmark , finland , and sweden are a bit higher though , at 57 to 62 % , but that still leaves significant incentive . 
  why would economic homogeneity * not * be a great boon to other nations ? 
  i 'll agree that it is n't necessarily easy to achieve , but not that it is n't a route to success . 
  norway really is n't all that special . 
  most of the oil wealth is n't even used in the state budget ; it is instead saved up in a pension fund . 
  the presence of oil is certainly helpful thanks to the jobs it creates though , but it is n't a massive outlier . 
  other european countries have oil too , the uk for example . 
  not as much per capita , but still a significant amount . 
  the nordics are all running low to negative deficits ( largest deficit is ~ 4 % in finland ) , so it does appear it is pretty sustainable . 
  of course , the big question is how the aging population will be handled , though that 's a problem facing all of western europe . 
   were everything is objectively and obviously worse for everybody . 
  except the top few percent , of course . 
  norway was a rich country even before oil was discovered . 
  resources are n't everything . 
  finland is to my knowledge not especially rich on resources either ( nor is iceland , but that 's such a tiny population that there 's not much point of comparison , i agree ) . 
  much of the large landmasses of the nordics are n't particularly useful either ; either being mountainous or dense forest . 
  population density maps show this nicely : http://i.imgur.com/fnfvulg.jpg . 
  so while there 's a lot of land , most of it can really be discounted for any comparisons to other european countries . 
  and the nordics are taking in a huge number of immigrants , yet our social systems are still holding up . 
  ethnic/cultural homogeneity really is n't the real issue/solution . 
  distribution of wealth and social capital is . 
  in the us this is of course heavily tied to race due to historical reasons , and in europe to some extent due to a lot of immigrants being refugees , and thus necessarily poor , but ethnic/cultural homogeneity in my opinion has virtually nothing to do with the success of the nordic model ; economic homogeneity is the real route to success . 
  norway and iceland are at 1.6 % and 1.9 % gdp growth ( according to the cia 2013 ) , comparable to the uk 's 1.8 % . 
  sweden is at 0.9 % , nearly twice of germany 's 0.5 % . 
  denmark and finland are n't doing all that well though i 'll admit , at 0.1 % and -0.6 % respectively . 
  note that the latter figure is from 2009 though , so it is thus probably positive today now that the worst of the economic crisis is over . 
  excluding finland due to the outdated figure , that puts scandi-iceland at 0.87 % gdp growth , which is not stagnant ; it puts the region above germany , austria , and france . 
  ( 0.5 % , 0.4 % , and 0.3 % respectively ), 
  when it works so well for the nordics , i do n't see a reason it would n't work for the rest of northern and western europe . 
  the nordics as a whole are quite a bit larger . 
  26 million people total . 
  all of which have middling to low unemployment ( all numbers are for 2013 , as i could n't find a number for iceland in 2014 ) : * denmark - 6.6 % * finland - 8.2 % * norway - 3.5 % ( stat from eurostat ) * sweden - 8.0 % * iceland - 4.5 % ( stat from [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_iceland#cite_note-4 ) ) weighted by population ( i ca n't be arsed to look up the labor forces , so this wo n't be 100 % accurate , but labor force is roughly similar in the 5 countries , so it 'll be pretty close ) , that 's 6.8 % . 
  seems to me that welfare states work quite well . 
  he 's presumably referring to the [ belgian congo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgian_congo ) . 
  income in norway is quite a bit higher than us income ; only after purchase parity adjustments are they comparable . 
  as such , if you 're paying as much in nominal money for your surgery , you 're paying a lower portion of your income , and thus the treatment is effectively cheaper than in the us . 
  here 's that wikipedia page : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_median_wage the us is not on top . 
  it is 4th after luxembourg , norway , and switzerland . 
  note that the page is for household income , as there does not appear to be a wikipedia page on median * wage * . 
   whaling is different given most whale species ' conservation status . 
  the only type of whale hunted in norway is the minke whale , which has the `` least concern '' conservation status . 
  only some species of whale are endangered . 
  i agree that hunting endangered whales is an issue , but norway 's whaling should n't be an ethical issue . 
  you 're right . 
  i retract that bit ( though the crop is still unnecessarily close ) . 
  because europe really just means the eu these days apparently . 
  note how norway and switzerland are also left out . 
  ~ ~ i also like how finland is n't even on the map despite being in the eu . ~ ~ and how serbia apparently includes montenegro in 2014 . 
  a lot of scandinavians make this error , since `` insulated '' and `` isolated '' is the same word in the scandinavian languages ( `` isolert '' in norwegian ; the same or similar in danish and swedish ) . 
  ^ ( not that it is a bad thing you 're correcting him ; i just thought you might like to know why he made that specific error . ), 
  apparently switzerland 's foreign-born population is 28.9 % , while norway 's is only 13.8 % ( hardly insignificant , but still a lot lower than the swiss ) , so that might be right , yeah . 
  ( [ source on those percentages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_foreign-born_population ) ) . 
  norway has had quite a bit of immigration ; it is the main source of our population growth ( though unlike many european/western countries we do actually have a bit of a birth-death surplus ) , but most of the immigrants ( especially the immigrants that come here in order to earn money by breaking laws or begging ) end up in the major cities , so i 'd guess fewer norwegians have had negative experiences involving immigrants than swiss have . 
  actually , you 're right . 
  i 've rewritten the comment to remove any mention of xenophobia . 
  that the two correlate quite a bit should be obvious enough . 
  obviously xenophobia is far from the only reason to oppose immigration , but the correlation between a xenophobic society , and widespread opposition towards immigration is in my opinion not something that can be ignored . 
  so i 'm not saying everyone who opposes immigration is a xenophobe , but i definitely understand how it could 've been read that way ; i 'll add a note to my original comment . 
  really ? 
  i feel norway is in general less opposed to immigration than switzerland , and there it only passed with 50.3 % of the votes . 
  so even just being * slightly * less opposed to immigration compared to switzerland would mean it would n't pass . 
  yeah . 
  only having the residents of oslo vote on it was ridiculous . 
  it 's obvious the only reason they did it like that was as that was the only way it had a snowball 's chance in hell of actually passing ; a national vote would almost certainly have favored not applying for the olympics . 
  for reference , i 'm registered in oslo , and voted no to the olympics . 
  sadly more of my fellow voters voted in favor than against . 
  much of the coast at least should be colored as norwegian . 
  it has long been norwegian-majority . 
  the inland parts on the other hand are indeed mostly sami , but most of the coast is definitely not . 
  from wikipedia :  the sami are in a majority only in the municipalities of guovdageaidnu-kautokeino , karasjohka-karasjok , porsanger , deatnu-tana and unjargga-nesseby in finnmark , and g\u00e1ivuotna ( k\u00e5fjord ) in northern troms . 
  all but one of these are in [ finnmark ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/norway_counties_finnmark_position.svg/500px-norway_counties_finnmark_position.svg.png ) , while most maps stretch the sami ethnic area much further south and west . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sh0bn0f.png ) 's a very rough ( done on a touchpad ) of where the split between norwegian and sami goes today . 
  it might be slightly more in the samis favor in 1918 , though most of the `` norwegification '' policies had ended by then to my knowledge . 
  not that expensive ; oslo to hamar ( nearly exactly 100km ) is $ 31.50 ( 249 nok ) , so only slightly more expensive than in the uk . 
  then again , oslo to trondheim is also $ 31.50 , and that 's nearly 400km by air . 
  of course , you do need to buy a ticket a few days in advance in order to get it that price . 
  it 's a bit more if you buy it on the same day as the train leaves . 
  260 nok ( $ 33 ) in the case of oslo-hamar , but a lot more for trondheim ; 885 nok ( $ 112 ) . 
  yep . 
  as a result i suppose the only thing it accurately measures is how many people lie about having watched porn . 
  the question the article poses is very specific : `` how many hours do you have to work to buy the latest game ? '', 
  as such , paid leave needs to be taken into account .
