  the actual hourly wage as such is thus irrelevant in the context of the article . 
  their calculations seem to be a bit off . 
  in the case of norway they manage to go from a net wage of # 33,195 ( about right , from what i can find ) , to an hourly wage of # 17 . 
  this would mean that a norwegian worked 1950 hours a year , or 52 full work weeks . 
  it should be obvious that this does not happen , considering the legal minimum vacation is 4 weeks , with several public holidays further reducing the hours worked . 
  in practice , [ according to the oecd ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=anhrs ) , the average employed norwegian works 1420 hours a year . 
  this would give an hourly wage of # 23.4 , or 213 nok . 
  at a price per game of 549 nok ( [ example ] ( http://www.elkjop.no/product/spill-og-konsoll/spill-playstation-3/ps3beyondts/beyond-two-souls-ps3 ) ) , that 's 2.58 hours of work , not 3.19 . 
  not a huge discrepancy , but it could definitely change the order of some of the countries on the list . 
  of course , that 's not even getting into that they 've seemingly assumed that the average norwegian worker has no deductions whatsoever ; instead he 's completely debt free , lives right by wherever he works , is unmarried , and does n't save any money for buying a house in the future ( gives a deduction of 20 % of the amount saved per year ) . 
  even with no deductions whatsoever , the average net wage of a norwegian employee is slightly higher than stated in the article , and then even higher if it is a full-time employee . 
  [ the average wage per month in norway was 39 600 nok in 2013 ] ( http://www.ssb.no/en/arbeid-og-lonn/statistikker/lonnansatt/aar/2013-03-20 ) , for 475 200 nok total per year . 
  the average paid tax on the other hand [ was 106 800 nok ] ( http://www.ssb.no/a/english/kortnavn/selvangivelse_en/tab-2012-11-16-01-en.html ) . 
  this gives a net wage of 368 400 , or 260 nok/hour . 
  the end result is 2.11 hours per game , considerably lower than the listed value of 3.19 . 
  as such i find it difficult to take the statistics in the article seriously , especially as from what i can tell there are no listed sources . 
  it was established as a buffer against muslim iberia by charlemagne , along with many more countries along the pyrenees . 
  it 's the only one that stood the test of time though . 
  probably for the population numbers . 
  the average swedish monthly wage is 28 891 nok . 
  the average norwegian monthly wage is 39 600 nok . 
  service-related stuff and meat being twice as expensive while wages are near 40 % higher is n't really that big a deal when most other things are the same price or slightly higher than sweden . 
   who does n't ? 
  students . 
  spend 100 a day as a student on food , and you 'll be using 50 % of your student loan on food . 
  everyone with a job though ... yeah , they can probably afford it . 
  before tax . 
  even then though , $ 15 really is n't that much . 
  and a frozen pizza is only about $ 5.50 . 
  you can enable that for non-moderators by ticking the `` user can edit ? '',

  norge , from `` nord vegr '' , meaning `` north way '' , or roughly `` the way north '' , yes . 
  norway - the way north . 
  we sure were creative back in the day . 
  ca n't say i 've ever heard someone seriously call it `` sn\u00f8brett '' , though i suppose purely calling it `` snowboard '' might be limited to ( eastern ) oslo rather than something that spans the whole country . 
   instead of just going with this word they translated it to snj\u00f3bretti ( snj\u00f3 = snow , bretti = board ) . 
  sounds reasonable , does n't it ? 
  we tried that in norwegian : `` sn\u00f8brett '' . 
  ofc , no one actually says that as it sounds terrible , 
  i think they feel more at home out there . 
  pretend the whole of iberia is upside down . 
  gibraltar is actually andorra . 
  instead i made it far too small . 
  i started with the uk and scandinavia , and then somehow everything got huge after that . 
  [ i should obviously become an artist ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vosriun.jpg ) . 
  i 'm terribly sorry to anyone i 've misplaced . 
  what if we let them in on the condition that they get themselves nordic crosses ? 
  ca n't we let scotland and estonia in ? 
  they 're nice . 
  `` done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations , for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses . '', 
  `` fraternity between nations '' should cover the eu pretty well , 
  indeed . 
  indeed . 
  but make the scale detailed enough and you will of course see some reasonably big differences between say , western oslo and rural areas . 
  while there 's purchasing power differences between the urban and rural areas of norway , even the rural areas are richer than most of europe . 
  extend the scale a few steps further and norway probably would n't be a single color any more . 
  just replaced it due to being a bit outdated . 
  a positive side effect is a better projection . 
  thanks . 
  i 've replaced it with a version that should be completely up to date . 
  much of it : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/netflix_area.svg/1280px-netflix_area.svg.png ( yellow is announced/coming soon ), 
  a majority is a majority . 
  especially considering the status quo has inertia on its side . 
  if some regions of catalonia then wanted to return to spain , or even form their own country , then that seems reasonable enough . 
  the latter seems rather unlikely , so i 'm not sure it is even worth considering . 
  if all those regions want to secede , then maybe that 's for the best ? 
  i do n't believe a region should have to be part of another country against the will of its people . 
  being understandable does not make it justified however . 
  constitutions can be amended . 
  by preventing a bilateral solution , madrid is themselves responsible for the unilateral result . 
  it 'll definitely be damaging , yeah . 
  i 'd lay the blame for that on spain 's feet for preventing a bilateral solution . 
  it will , yes . 
  does n't automatically make it a bad thing . 
  civil disobedience is a good example of criminal activity that can be the right thing to do despite being illegal . 
  yep . 
  i comment in a number of subs . 
  unilateral declaration of independence is the only option when the federal government refuses to allow bilateral independence . 
  how exactly are they to stop an unilateral declaration ? 
  they can refuse to recognize it , but unless they 're willing to use some sort of force there 's nothing they can do to actually prevent it . 
  even if no one recognizes them , that does n't make them not independent . 
  somaliland is independent despite essentially no recognition . 
  transnistria is independent despite essentially no recognition . 
  probably plenty of other countries , but those are the two that immediately come to mind . 
  trying to destroy catalonia 's economy would probably be a great way for spain to turn other countries against them , not to mention the catalonians themselves . 
  their best bet is probably to continue claiming catalonia is part of spain , much like china does with taiwan . 
  yep . 
  chances are they 'll simply pay the fine , and that 'll be the end of that . 
  if some countries being unwilling to stand in solidarity is what brings the eu down , then good riddance to it . 
  i doubt that 's going to actually end up happening though . 
  at worst the countries that refuse to meet their responsibilities will be ejected , and the rest continue the ever closer union . 
  i lived in a part of oslo where over half the population was non-western immigrants . 
  i now live in a part of trondheim where there 's near no non-western immigrants . 
  i ca n't say i 've noticed any significant differences between the two places . 
  living in that part of oslo was great . 
  living in this part of trondheim is great . 
  so i have no idea about malm\u00f8 and so on , but my own experience shows that it is clearly * possible * for non-western immigrants to integrate well into european societies . 
  true . 
  their gdp is only slightly higher ( 490 billion usd vs. norway 's 420 ) . 
   which is less than for example poland , who received 1835 applications .
