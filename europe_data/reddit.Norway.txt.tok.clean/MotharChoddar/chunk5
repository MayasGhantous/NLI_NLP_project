  it can get abmnormally cold in one area of the world in a specific stretch of time while the world still has an upward trend in average temperature . 
  oh right , so turkey is culturally closer to japan than it is to greece ? 
  he thought mia khalifa was muslim . 
  she 's not . 
  she 's from a christian family, 
  it 's not a logical argument of `` the populace think women should basically be the property of their husband '' therefore `` no women on the streets '' . 
  it was a way of highlighting that if those countries the comment i replied to somehow were shining beacons of gender equality in the muslim world that they were not really doing all that great in the first place . 
  the percentages show the muslim majority countries mentioned have overwhelmingly regressive attitudes towards women . 
  the relevance is clear to me . 
  perhaps i would n't be criticizing islam as much if these kinds of articles were n't popping up on my front page as much recently . 
  oh , jordan and indonesia where 70 % + of muslims think sharia should be official law ? 
  turkey , where 65 % completely or mostly agree that women must always obey their husband , or indonesia where the figure is 93 % among muslims , and jordan where it 's 80 % . 
  something tells me that these sorts of attitudes towards women drives the public space to become such a sausage fest . 
  oh yeah , fn and nsdap totally have the same platform ... 
  if you read what the bar represents , it says `` position among top sites '' in each country . 
  if a country had no bar it would be the most popular site in the country , while a larger bar means it 's less popular . 
  as someone from northern norway ( further north than the northernmost point on iceland ) i ca n't say i 've ever encountered such an attitude . 
  maybe there 's less stigma around mental illness which leads more people to seek help ? 
  look at south korea on that list : it has the lowest usage of antidepressants of the countries mentioned , yet it has the second highest suicide rate in the world ( 28.9 per 100 000 ) . 
  and poland and lithuania . 
  scandinavian countries seem to be on pretty much the same level as the rest of western europe . 
  alt right is a white nationalist movement . 
  i 'm 4 km from the city center , though , so i assume location is the reason . 
  ( electricity is included in my rent as well which is nice ), 
  ah i missed that the map was in euros and not dollars . 
  that would be 550 euros then , and obviously i pay in nok . 
  damn oslo is expensive , i pay 590 dollars a month for a 30 m ^ 2 apartment in trondheim . 
  something something glass houses, 
  i think you 're misunderstanding the map . 
  is belgium a celtic country and russia a germanic country ? 
  no , the map displays the language family of the original word for the country name . 
  i suppose they were concerned about the situation of the russian minority in kirkenes . 
  [ hey , maybe you should consider becoming a furry ? 
  seems to be more accepted there .

  me too thanks, 
  oh ok i guess i do n't want my government to further those values then, 
   africa will not be as rich as europe in next 100 years , probably never . 
  yep  most people dont leave the poorest countries , but most migrants come from countries like mexico or china , much richer than most african countries . 
  if you really dont wan na migrants from africa , if they get richer , more people will leave . 
  i think it 's helpful to separate what influences someone to migrate into two parts . 
  firstly there 's the general satisfaction you feel where you live which is influenced by things like poverty , war , conflict , opression etc. 
  this is the baseline `` how much my life objectively sucks '' metric , and is something which with improvement would make more people content living where they live . 
  secondly there 's of course the pull factor of there being somewhere which is vastly better to live , wherein comparing your life to what it could be there subjectively would make it seem a lot worse . 
  this is the sort of pressure you 're describing , and here is where it 's important to disincentivize mass migration with measures such as stopping illegal boats and sending them back to african shores . 
  if it becomes less of a likely possibility for someone to migrate from africa to europe people will eventually stop trying in the numbers they are . 
  however , and this is the important part i was trying to get at , the first `` baseline measurement '' should be improved anyway because if it gets too low people are going to feel the sort of immense desperation which would cause them to risk their lives for a better life . 
  basically , restricting migration through `` stick measures '' would have a good effect but adding a `` carrot '' would make it better . 
   but the aid is really big problem , africa will not develop by throwing money on them , you are making the issue even worse , making unsustainable circle . 
  this for sure is true for a lot of things , including for instance things like swamping the continent with products made elsewhere , severely hapering the development of local industry , or an excessive amount of food aid crippling local agriculture . 
  there is good aid though : things like programs to teach use of contraceptives and general sex-ed , programs to fight easily cured diseases and vaccine programs , projects helping build up infrastructure , projects funding education systems etc. 
  of course such aid is not without its faults , with much of the money inevitably ending up in the hands of corrupt officials , but it is in europe 's best interest to see africa develop and become more peaceful and prosperous even though we might not see the positive change immediately . 
  wow thanks for the invaluable insight . 
  you sure changed my mind with that comment . 
   additionally , i 'd like to remind you to please be a good person and donate to african aid organizations uh that seems like a good idea if you do n't want to be flooded with migrants ... 
  if africa is less shitty less people will want to leave . 
  france just seems to hate everyone , huh ? 
  at least you ca n't steal our fish : ^ ), 
  well first of all we 're not in the eu . 
  [ polls of the question `` would you like norway to be part of the eu ? '', 
  hover around 70 % for `` no '' and 20 % `` yes '' . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norway%e2%80%93european_union_relations#opinion_polling ), 
  i thought denmark was a kinda eurosceptic country . 
  yea or the scandinavian mountain range, 
  they are sending them all over the country , but guess what : they tend to end up moving to the areas with more people they have more in common with , which makes perfect sense . 
  you ca n't really force citizens , immigrants or not , to stay in one spot and not move where they want to live . 
  it 's interesting how different comment sections of different articles can be . 
  / r/europe seems like the biggest example of these huge swings . 
  speak for yourself , southerner . 
  no u, 
  ahh , they 're the ones that built those polish death camps right ? 
  no , this is hamburg . 
   now hold up we, 
  are they doing better because or despite the refugees ?

  this is confusing ... 
  why are you replying to yourself ? 
  who said anything about tradition ? 
  i swear to god , catalonia . 
  it 's * decorative * . 
  thanks . 
  tradition or not , i still think they would be better without the strap ... 
  but ... 
  why ? 
  i 'm guessing a regular plastic fidget spinner is around 10 grams . 
  that would add up to a total of 3.5 million fidget spinners . 
  millions of spinners will perish ... 
  i do n't see the issue in killing whales when we have such strict quotas and only hunt minke whale , which has a large population which whaling actually keeps stable . 
  if you 're against killing animals that get to be free and happy in the wild their entire life until the day they 're killed i would expect you to be opposed to factory farming of , let 's say pigs . 
  i was at a dinner with a swedish guy present and we came to the topic of 17th of may , the norwegian national day , and he said if he were to go out and wave the swedish flag the way norwegians do he would probably be viewed as a racist . 
  if any swedes can let me know , does waving the flag in he streets have a similar connotation as doing so with the st. george 's cross in england where it 's heavily used as a symbol by racists ? 
  map was from 2011 ... not very representative . 
  i would not have expected a pole to say this . 
  i commend your consistency . 
  i think there are two very distinct problems here .
