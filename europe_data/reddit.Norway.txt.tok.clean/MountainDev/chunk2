  i 'm not talking about the in-between plays period , i 'm referring to the same as you ; scoring plays , injury time , time-outs etc. 
  where they absolutely do wait for the commercial break to end before commencing play . 
  again , i never said that this happened in between plays , i do n't know where you got that from . 
  the rest of your post has nothing to do with mine . 
  i never said it was 11 minutes of action and the rest commercials . 
  i ** love ** american football , it 's one of the most interesting sports in the world from a strategic point , what i said that that a 4 quarter game lasts 3\u00a01/2 hours ( though i was slightly off on that , my memory failed me , the average is roughly 3 hours and ten - fifteen minutes . 
  see for example here : http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/64441086/nfl-statistical-analysis-average-nfl-game ) . 
  i ** do ** understand af , which is why i love it , so i have no idea what your post is about ? 
  they wait because there 's a commercial on the tv channel that airs that particular game . 
  they ca n't restart the game until the channel is back from commercials , it has nothing to do with the game itself . 
  it would be like going to commercial while a player is down in a premier league game , and the team would n't be allowed to take the free-kick until sky sports ' commercial brake was over . 
  i know right ? 
  american football is one of my top three sports , i love it , but the fact that we ca n't even agree on what constitutes a `` catch '' in a 9 billion dollar professional league should tell outsiders everything they need to know , 
  right , i can see that happening . 
  thank you for the clarification . 
  okay , i honestly did n't know that , but i can see how it 's never really done since the catcher is practically sitting on the plate . 
  or are you talking about the fact that he can steal during errors ( e.g. 
  the catcher loses the ball and he has to run from his spot to pick it up ) ? 
  stealing involves a player on a base running to the next base . 
  back to what i said about safe spots , he 's only safe as long as he 's on the base ( i.e. 
  the white square ) , but there 's nothing to say he has to stand there all the time . 
  the reason stealing is so rare is that the pitcher is paying attention , and it 's pretty far from one base to the next . 
  the ball is much faster , so if the pitcher sees him sneaking , he will turn around and throw the ball to the bases where runner is . 
  meaning the runner can be thrown out . 
  oftentimes in a game you 'll see the pitcher throw the ball back to his base instead of forwards just to let him know `` i 'm paying attention '' , and if the runner is not careful and gets too far from the base , he can be struck out . 
  good basestealers are few and far between , and are usually very , very fast . 
  * edit : to add on to that , stealing the home base is not possible . 
  you can only have one man at each base , and the batter will stand at the home base as long as he 's trying to bat . 
  have you watched it in a stadium ? 
  it 's a weird experience . 
  i absolutely love american football , i 've followed it for close to 25 years , yet even i will admit that it 's gotten ridiculous ( many of those breaks are actually called `` commercial breaks '' for a reason ) . 
  i got the opportunity to go to my first nfl game about 5 years ago , and i was amazed to see that when there is a break in the action , the players are * literally * just standing around talking and bullshitting while waiting for the ref to blow the whistle which signals that the tv is out of commercial and the game is back on . 
  watching it on tv you notice the breaks , but watching it live i saw just how much those breaks destroy the flow of the game . 
  think about it ; a game is 4 * quarters * , yet a full game typically lasts more than 3\u00a01/2 hours . 
  i can give you a breif rundown of the rules . 
  the game is played in 9 `` innings '' , one inning consisting of two parts . 
  team a will throw the ball and team b try to hit the ball and in the second part of the inning team b will throw and team a will hit . 
  then it goes on to the next inning . 
  although 9 innings must be played , a game can theoretically go on forever as a team must win ( there is no draw ) , so if there is a draw after 9 innings they play a 10th , then 11th etc. 
  until one team leaves the inning one point ( or more ahead ) . 
  as you have gathered , the point of baseball is to score points . 
  how do you do that ? 
  by scoring what is called a `` run '' . 
  the person with the baseball bat is called the hitter or batter , and his job is to hit the baseball and run the course laid out on the field . 
  this consists of three `` bases '' . 
  when a hitter/runner reaches the place he stood when he was batting ( homebase ) , he scores one point for his team . 
  the thrower - or pitcher as he 's called - will try to throw difficult balls that makes it difficult to hit . 
  however , the pitcher has a very tight window he must throw the ball into for it to be counted as a proper throw . 
  in short , the pitcher will throw a variety of throws with a hard ball towards the batter . 
  the ball must hit a tight virtual window for it to count , and the batter can choose to try to hit or let it go past him . 
  each batter has a number of chances to hit the ball - these are called strikes . 
  he can miss twice , but getting a third strike means he 's now `` out '' ( i 'll come back to outs later ) . 
  the pitcher , as you know , has a very tight window , and if the ball is considered to be outside of that window it is called a `` ball '' . 
  if the count reaches four balls the batter is allowed a free walk unto first base . 
  the exchange then is for the pitcher to try to get each batter to `` strike out '' , i.e. 
  miss with three strikes , or only allow him hits that are picked up by the pitching team . 
  back to outs . 
  outs are really important , they determine the end of an period . 
  when a team has three outs , the sides are switched and the pitching team becomes the hitting team and vice versa . 
  so after two of these sections you change the inning . 
  outs can be scored in a few ways in addition to striking out . 
  if the batter hits the ball , but the pitching team can catch the ball before the ball hits the ground , it means the batter is out . 
  furthermore , if the batter hits the ball , it bounces and the pitching team picks it up they can now try to get an out on the batter . 
  typically this involves throwing the ball to the base where the batter is heading , if the ball arrives before the batter , he is out ( this will involve the pitching team 's receiver having at least one foot on the base - which is a white square ) . 
  this is a very tl ; dr version , there are numerous nuances to baseball , but the purpose is for the batting team to hit the ball and run around the bases to get a score . 
  if the batter his the ball so well that it goes outside of the stadium ( or the other team fumbles the ball/don ' t move fast enough ) the batter might get around all the bases and home in a single hit - this is called a `` homerun '' . 
  more commonly early batters will score `` base hits '' ( i.e. 
  they get to base 1 or 2 - typically ) and batters coming after them will try to hit the ball and allow their teammates to score . 
  hopefully this cleared something up , if you have any particular questions let me know . 
  ( regards , a norwegian who actually enjoys a bit of baseball every now and then ), 
  if someone had told me 18 months ago that donald trump would run for president of the us , yet it would be overshadowed by uk politics , i would have laughed in their face . 
  at this point , it is more of a very nervous laughter . . 
  so both main men now refuse to take responsibility to clean up what they started . 
  marvelous . 
  in one way or another , the leaders of the leave campaign have cemented their place in history books in europe . 
  let 's hope it will be a `` despite these people '' story , and not `` because of '' . 
   and the differences between the generally poor fisherman / blue collar workers of ~ 70 years ago and the current oil-revenue infused generation ( and being an overall successful modern country ) are astounding . 
  this is exaggerated not only in his books , but in many stories around norway . 
  it seems like it 's been a `` rags to riches '' story , and clearly the oil income has made a huge impact on society for better or for worse , but even before the discovery of oil norway was not a poor nation . 
  at the time of the first world war , norway had one of the largest trade fleets in the world , and through both world wars and the time in between , that merchant fleet took up a large portion of the sea . 
  while fishing and farming where the main employers , it was nothing like modern day farming communities in poor nations . 
  what it shows is that in the 1870 's , norway 's standard of living was higher than most african nations * today * . 
  that 's hardly dirt poor . 
  clearly norway was not the u.k or france , but saying it was a poor nation until the exploitation of oil ( which only started happening as late as the 1960 's ) is misleading . 
  between the farming and fishing , and a huge merchant fleet , the living standard was certainly above what is considered the existential minimum , and i think a lot of people ( also here in norway mind you ) like to jump on the rags to riches because it sounds good . 
  one thing to look at is norway is very much linked to sweden , denmark and the rest of the nordics , countries that have done just fine without discovering oil . 
  moving back to the parent you replied to it sounds like norwegians have dropped the will to work hard and feel entitled to everything . 
  i 'm not saying it is all wrong , * however * is n't that the case in all of the west ? 
  it seems to me the entitlement and the `` do n't offend me '' generation is not just norwegian , but it happens in the us , u.k , sweden , denmark , france , germany . . everywhere in the west . 
  are n't mexicans taking jobs americans are unwilling to take ? 
  are n't poles taking jobs brits are unwilling to take ? 
  this entire article touches on this . 
  my point is that i feel this has less to do with oil and more to do with the west in general . 
  i want to put forth another point on this subject . 
  another reason for fewer `` native '' norwegians in the factory and `` minimum wage '' business is simply that we have a far larger percentage getting university level education than before . 
  unemployment is very low , education is high . 
  if you have a bachelor or masters degree in engineering , you 're not going to paint houses for a living . 
  there are more nuances and grey areas than simply saying immigrants are taking jobs we do n't want to do , or that they are stealing our jobs . 
  i would argue it 's a mix of a lot of factors . 
  do n't know why you were downvoted , i think you 're absolutely right .
