  was n't it a socialist government in germany that started agenda 2010 ? 
  [ it 's a reference to this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthem_of_europe ), 
  my formula is flawless , damnit !, 
  ah yes , the `` i 'm not x , but y are z '' - line pretty much means that the person saying it is x. 
  `` the question is who else in europe is willing to hand over their liberties to the next iteration of the german reich ? '', 
  really ... ? 
  these are actually pretty good and informative . 
  thanks . 
  yeah ... 
  they are and this is odd as the government is built up by three parties , in which the mentioned labour party is the largest in the coalition . 
  even though i do n't agree with their policies in general , i am pretty sure this is n't backing , but just wanting a report on what the consequences on drilling would be . 
  we had flags everywhere , had national unity and were sincerely saddened , too , but the whole ` proud to be a [ enter nationality here ] ' was n't that present for most people . 
  though i am most likely very biased in this , i think we had our proceeding case against the shooter/bomber done quite well . 
  edit : forgot to mention that i am norwegian . 
  wait ... teenagers vote for golden dawn ? 
  awesome . 
  this video is from 31/07/12 . 
  how is this situation now ? 
  is there an opposing view to the one presented in the video ? 
  i am embarrassed that i do n't know much about romanian politics , could someone enlighten me on this ? 
  large agricultural areas with huge potential and getting out of the authoritarian sphere of the russian federation , i 'd say . 
  i do too . 
  a true european identity will form eventually , it will just take time . 
  a continental union does not take form over night , as we can see with both the united states and the european union . 
  hey , eventually we norwegians can join too . 
  americans did view themselves as texans , virginians , new english etc , but the union eventually created an identity as a whole . 
  this grew mainly after the civil war , which effectually ended the dispute if the united states was a confederation or a permanent union . 
  i saw this live from the parliament earlier today . 
  it 's a great speech . 
  [ godwin 's law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin%27s_law ), 
  why not both ? 
  some of those comments on the article make me shudder ... 
  pretty bad from a europhile perspective , a party that is a part of the current government coalition just passed in their party program that they want out of schengen and want a referendum on the eea . 
  granted , they are the mostly eurosceptical , but still ... 
  the actual public debate is that there is none . 
  europabevegelsen , the organisation wanting norway to join publicly stated that trying to get norway in is n't a realistic goal at the moment . 
  most of the people against it now mention the issues in europe and how norway is doing much better on its own , and another common thing to mention is that they do n't want to change currency . 
  `` why do we need the eu , they need us '' is another one . 
  so i think we will join at some point , but not until europe has come stronger out of this and when we are forced to reform due to dwindlig oil exports . 
  edit : sorry for any spelling errors , writing this on my phone , fixed some of them . 
  i 'm washed away in our oil money , weeee ... 
  i 'm one of the few pro-eu people left , there are iirc 17 % of us , so ... that 's something . 
  additionally , this would be a nice time to reference the following : https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/no-true-scotsman, 
  i am . 
  as a norwegian i believe that we have problems in the administration of welfare and other government programs that are n't dealt with due to our current prosperity . 
  i personally fear that this will be our downfall as we have n't had any will , or have any current will , to reform . 
  there 's no plus except gaining representation in the parliament and the most important one at the moment for representation of the nation , the ec , on the laws that affect us . 
  it should be a country . 
  got to love our long-term policies !, 
  exactly . 
  we pay it with our personal batches of oil-money . 
  i did some research on this and as far as i 've seen , hawaii is a part of north america . 
  i fail to see the controversy in this . 
  just because the regime was clearly horrible to certain parts of the population , * everything * was n't bad during it 's rule . 
  note that everything is an absolute term . 
  to me this just seems like sensationalism . 
  great idea !, 
  though i have this strange feeling of deja vu . 
  but we did get an independent , autonomous international bank , [ the ecb ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_central_bank#history ), 
  why not both kalmar and the eu ? 
  we 'll have to help them reconquer finland though . 
  i 'd say it does n't if the leader is elected by popular vote , the will of the people etc. 
  is she ? 
  you actually give a fair point though , and i appreciate an argument like this . 
  my view of the whole matter is that the organization of the european union has contributed to less hostility and , to a degree , prosperity on the european continent , and therefore could deserve the peace prize . 
  i do agree though that the timing is a bit ... off , at least politically timed . 
  i may have become a bit polarized in the direction of pro-europe after being subjected to the rabid anti-eu sentiment here in norway . 
  afaik it was n't the eu , but the member nations themselves that declared war . 
  i do n't get how this myth just keeps getting repeated . 
  the eu is transparent as hell , it 's just that people are too lazy to actually go to a website . 
  mostly due to countries not wanting to give up sovreignty of their police . 
  that 's what i assume anyway . 
  the eu does not have a mandate to do so . 
  aww , they did n't use the victoria 2 map this time . 
  i love this guy !, 
  i never heard of him until i read the article regarding pst and concluded that either he 's a russian spy or incredibly stupid . 
  then i read the article regarding electromagnetic hypersensitivity and made up my mind . 
  germany does n't run the ecb . 
  no more roaming !, 
  that sounds just like norway . 
  or even the european states on the map . 
   * used to be . 
  and yes , it is the flag of the eu now . 
  it 's both . 
   this huge over reliance on one sector of course made norway 's economy pretty unstable ... 
  i 'm glad we learned from our mistake . 
  wait ... 
  never argued that , i just explained the logic . 
  the whole issue is that while mmos and such are built for a certain amount of lag , any lag within voip would result in either stuttering on the line or a general fallout . 
  therefore a small priority could be applied as to prioritize traffic via the voip-ports so to avoid that . 
  this would n't really make such a huge impact on any other services , like browsing or streaming ( which can buffer ) , but would be a big improvement to call-quality within voip lines . 
  it could also be a bit future oriented , as normal copper lines are becoming increasingly decommissioned and voip taking over . 
  source : worked with troubleshooting voip . 
  it usually requires a more stable line to retain good quality while in a call . 
  sweet sweet oilmoney ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ may ^ ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ ^ may ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ ^ running ^ ^ ^ ^ out, 
  norway stronk . 
   one country is n't enough to stop it ... actually it is according to the lisboa treaty . 
  it 's less of an opt-out and more of a loophole . 
  that 's happening today though . 
  well , they were , via elections .
