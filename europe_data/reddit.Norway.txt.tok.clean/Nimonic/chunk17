  as soon as he goes over the badboy limit he 'll start badboy wars and everyone he borders or on the same continent as him will declare war on him . 
  how so ? 
  i hope you 're aware that you 're a joke in this subreddit . 
  that 's funny , are n't you the guys who keep having to invade or otherwise interfere in countries on the other side of the world because you feel `` threatened '' by them ? 
  you 'd think you would n't have to since you spend more money on `` at least looking like you * could * kill people '' than most of the rest combined . 
  no , but lithuania certainly was , which is what this entire article is about . 
  additionally , while poland and the other warsaw pact states were not part of the soviet union de jure , they were essentially run from moscow . 
   if russia can get away with ukraine , they can proceed to reconstitute the ussr without worry of intervention . 
  except the baltic states , poland and most of the previous european warsaw pact states are all part of nato , which would automatically bring the rest of nato into conflict with russia . 
  this is a pretty bad situation , but let 's not make it out to be something it 's not just for dramatic effect . 
  as big a deal as that is , exports is n't the whole economy . 
  our economy is n't 59 % petroleum based . 
  russia may not be the soviet union , and they certainly ca n't win a war against the us , but i do n't think the us can win a war against russia either . 
  can you imagine how many would die , on both sides ? 
  you saw the public reaction in the us over a few thousand soldiers in iraq and afghanistan . 
  and that 's not even considering the threat of a nuclear exchange . 
  that throws a whole new spanner in the works . 
  it would never happen . 
  not even over an invasion of ukraine . 
  that said , i do n't think there 's any real chance of russia actually invading ukraine , either . 
   china realized not to long ago , that regardless of how much they want it , they will never be as strong as the us . 
  i do n't think there 's a chance in hell that the us declares war on russia over ukraine . 
  we went through the cold war without those two going to war , as significant as these events are it 's nothing compared to what happened in those days . 
  but it did n't just put it in there for general context . 
  it followed it up with the word * yet * , as if having a population of 1.3 million makes it less likely to have a higher per capita of something . 
  because they are 2/3 of crima and they are fucked in the head and they are incidentally russian ; have n't you been paying attention ? 
  or something . 
  we have no application . 
  again , we would be happy to take you back into the norwegian fold . 
  think about it . 
  i do n't really disagree with that definition , but that 's why we talk about * failed * revolutions . 
  perhaps calling them revolutions is semantically inaccurate , but it 's easier than separating revolutions and attempted ( or failed ) revolutions . 
  the revolution of 1905 in russia did n't lead to any real change , so it was definitely more of an attempted , or failed , revolution than a successful one . 
  yes , because of the civil war . 
  i 'm beginning to think you read the first half of my answer , saw `` attempted coup '' and then decided i needed to be corrected immediately . 
  those were just two examples . 
  i do n't think this is a very controversial point , there really is nothing in the definition of revolution that says it has to be successful to be one . 
  i do n't know where you came up with it . 
  and although it does n't matter , the `` success stories '' of the two examples is really far from it . 
  the 1905 revolution achieved symbolic change at best , and the revolutions of 1848 achieved * far * from what they set out to do . 
  in no country were the revolters actually successful in establishing a new government , and most of the immediate concessions were reverted within a few years . 
  with that said , i still do n't think the ukraine situation is a revolution . 
  at least not yet . 
  well if it had succeeded he would n't have needed a several-year civil war . 
  it did n't fail , but i would n't say it succeeded either . 
  that was more of an attempted coup and then a civil war , but that 's just semantics . 
   the old government is still in place , so it 's not a revolution ( yet ) . 
  uh , that 's not how it works . 
  whether this is a revolution or not , revolutions can fail and still be revolutions . 
  like the russian revolution of 1905 , or the revolutions of 1848 , the so-called `` spring of nations '' . 
  failed revolutions . 
  no need to editorialize the title . 
  the article you link to does n't place the blame anywhere . 
  you also make it seem like all the dead are protesters , but are n't nearly half of them policemen ? 
   the regime they propped up were n't they elected ? 
  it also says that about russia , and russia is most certainly a european country . 
  georgia counts as europe . 
  apparently it 's 6 policemen now ? 
  we should have done better , but we 're so used to success in the winter olympics that even relative success feels like failure . 
  we are after all the all-time leader for winter olympics . 
  we 'll still end up with a decent haul , but less than it should have been considering our competitors . 
  well , there are a few candidates for norway . 
  first , there 's obviously [ skrik \\ ( the scream \\ ) by edvard munch ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/the_scream.jpg ) , for the `` world renown '' factor . 
  another one is [ brudeferd i hardanger \\ ( bridal procession on the hardangerfjord \\ ) by adolph tidemand ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/adolph_tidemand_%26_hans_gude_-_bridal_procession_on_the_hardangerfjord_-_google_art_project.jpg ) , showing the virtues of the so-called national romanticism period . 
  finally i guess there 's a case to be made for [ this painting ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/eidsvoll_riksraad_1814.jpeg ) of the eidsvoll gathering in 1814 when norway 's constitution was signed . 
   if you want to back your point up using / r/askhistorians please do so , i do n't need to because i 've done a 2 year course on the matter , as should have everyone who 's gone through the uk education system . 
  if we 're going to appeal to claims of competence , i guess this is where i say i have a masters degree in history . 
  that 's a 5 year course , by the way . 
  beyond that , i 'm not really interested in keeping up this discussion . 
  for someone who has studied history you 're sure quick to call the people you 're debating with ignorant , or say things like `` the propaganda machines have clearly been whirring in your head '' , or claims of obvious bias . 
  we made contrary claims about what is `` well accepted '' by most historians , how are we going to settle that question without asking * actual * historians ? 
  i am not an expert , and neither are you . 
  since you insist , though , it 's really quite simple . 
  russia only started mobilizing * after * austria-hungary had declared war on serbia , which they only dared do because they were explicitly told that the germans would support any action , including war . 
  just a few days prior to this , russia had supported calls for a peace convention to settle the matter without war . 
  you asked `` what reason did france have for mobilizing '' , which shows you do n't have your time-line right . 
  france only started mobilizing * after * germany , and after germany had refused to guarantee belgium 's safety . 
  germany 's plan to go through belgium to attack france was n't exactly a secret at this point . 
  in short , the facts are clear . 
  germany , fuelled by the military-industrial complex , gave their full support to austria-hungary to start a war in the balkans which they knew would draw russia in . 
  germany declared war on russia and france ; not the other way around . 
  germany invaded neutral belgium , activating a very clear and well-known british obligation to intervene . 
  germany is not fully to blame , as they claimed at versailles , but they * were * more to blame than any other nation . 
  go ahead and ask this question in / r/askhistorians , and see what kind of answer you get . 
  it is also well accepted that they * do * deserve most of the blame for ww1 . 
  just not all of it , which they got . 
  this all comes back to the blank cheque germany made to austria-hungary . 
  russia were obligated to defend serbia in the event of a war , and france had an alliance with russia . 
  if that is n't given , then there is no reason for russia to mobilize . 
  it was n't a treaty . 
  it was a message that they would support any action the austro-hungarians took , up to and including war . 
  nor did germany have to declare war on russia , and then france . 
  nor did they have to invade france through neutral belgium , bringing britain into the war . 
  that 's not to say the other parties were innocent , but germany must take more of the blame . 
  ask at / r/askhistorians , you 'll get the same answer . 
  it 's definitely not * wrong * , just perhaps unintentionally misleading , since most people do n't have degrees in archeology and will probably think of `` human '' as really just being us . 
  this is a little bit misleading , in that these were not what most people think of when they say `` human '' . 
  they might have been human , but they were n't homo sapiens . 
  i 'm not sure i agree with that . 
  people have voiced concerns over the right-wing influences of the protests , but that does n't mean they think it 's anything like a `` neo-nazi uprising '' , or even a right-wing uprising .
