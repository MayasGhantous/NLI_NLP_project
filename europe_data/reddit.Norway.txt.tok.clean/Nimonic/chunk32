  if it is n't a rule in / r/europe , it should be . 
   just like infinite monkeys with typewriters with infinite time will eventually produce a work of shakespeare this wo n't actually happen , but i 'll take your word on the other one !, 
   but we only get one side of the story . 
  that 's incredibly rich , considering what this sub has looked like the last few weeks . 
   she was right in trying to stop them . 
  she is ( was , thankfully ) a reporter , she was n't right to do anything at all except for document it . 
  it 's not even like . 
  it 's `` same symptoms '' . 
  if you attack us , you 'll attack nato . 
  that means the us will be at war with the us . 
  the last time you did that , you lost slavery . 
  what will it be this time ? 
  patriotism ? 
  yes , i too noticed the surprisingly high estimations of illicit and unregistered guns . 
  hundred of thousands seems very high considering how big news it is whenever any gun at all is involved in a crime . 
  let 's not mince words here . 
  you did n't leave her with us , she won custody over us . 
  maybe if you had n't been so neglecting we would n't have had to move in with mom . 
  and she bought us a playstation . 
  i would n't agree that `` fond of guns '' fits very well . 
  we generally do n't have guns just to have guns . 
  and essentially never for personal protection . 
  those stats are a bit confusing . 
  it estimates the total number of privately owned guns to be 1.3 million , but if you add the estimates for rifles , shotguns and handguns the number is above 2 million . 
  the numbers do seem to be decreasing , though . 
  do n't you dare say that . 
  we 've been down this road before . 
  it 's quite different from something like the us , though . 
  most guns are in the hands of relatively few people , mostly hunters . 
  additionally reservists in the national guard will have a service rifle at home . 
  there 's no real `` gun culture '' to speak of . 
  we 're just a large country with a small population , making hunting easier to do . 
  most people do n't hunt , but some do a lot . 
   except they actually were muslim immigrants source on this ? 
  i have n't seen anyone go out with this information . 
   and norway is quite fond of guns iirc . 
  that 's taking it a bit far . 
  hunting is n't uncommon , but it 's not something everyone does . 
   finland , sweden , norway , the netherlands , austria all have less . 
  those countries * combined * have a slightly higher population than poland , so that 's not exactly a surprise . 
  just start calling yourselves estland . 
  it 'll transition from there . 
  keep in mind this is from 2007 . 
  the percentage of adult norwegian ( daily ) smokers has dropped from ~ 22 % to ~ 13 % since then . 
  you are literally the only one who is talking about any kind of glorifying . 
  i understand plenty , but you keep saying how terrible you feel about what the americans did , and yet you still feel the need to constantly qualify it by pointing out how bad * the other side * was . 
  it 's like you 're struggling between ingratiating yourself to europeans by apologizing for something that quite honestly does n't have anything to do with you , and defending the honour of your country by making excuses about a `` chaotic post-war environment '' . 
  he feels terrible about it , but not terrible enough not to try to justify it and vilify the other side . 
  this is the exact attitude which makes americans sometimes point at south america and go `` how could they take soviet aid ? 
  did n't they know how little liberty there is in the soviet union ? 
  '' , or `` sure , we did some bad things , but would it have been any better under the soviets ? '', 
  it 's an inability to separate ideology and reality . 
  i 'm sure there were few people in south america during the cold war , even left-wingers , who would seriously suggest people in the soviet union were freer than people in the us . 
  but they were n't * in * the soviet union or the us . 
  their reality was one of us-backed military dictatorships , assassinations and general unpleasantness . 
  that is how you end up with a continent full of people who dislike you more than reagan 's `` evil empire '' . 
  whether against foreign enemies or traitors . 
  as much as an insufferable twit g\u00e9rard depardieu is , this seems excessive . 
  it 's a / pol / thing , which when added to another comment where he posts a comic playing into jewish stereotypes ( oh vey , goy , etc ) and his brand new account pretty much tells us all we need to know about him . 
   those swedish ** cucks ** pretends it 's nothing so bad , like some rape victim convincing herself that she kinda likes criminal , to get rid part of the shame . 
  oh , you 're one of * those * people . 
  was n't / pol / enough for you ? 
  yeah , that 's what i 'm thinking too . 
  that was pretty much just you guys , though . 
  and finland , more or less willingly . 
  unless you 're talking about kalmar , the swedish empire never included all the countries . 
  really , it only included finland . 
  i hear from my southern friends that danish is easier to understand than swedish , but to me it 's the complete opposite . 
  i can have a perfectly good conversation with a swede , but with a dane i 'll have to concentrate not to miss half the words . 
  they are purely written languages . 
  they are never considered the same language . 
  they are just very similar for historical reasons . 
  also note that they are a lot more similar written than spoken . 
  i do n't think you know what that means . 
   back to / r/conspiracy [ 1 ] with you that 's funny , considering you just submitted this post to / r/bestof :  but i do n't want all my taxes to go to african and muslim freeloaders . 
  they will destroy a social system within 5 years , that took 70 years to build . 
  they will also destroy peace . 
  in the end it 'll be them or us . 
  like the cia predicted : civil war . 
   but there are plenty of racists to go around that will do that . 
  yes , but without google it will be harder for many of them to find it . 
  google removing it will provide it with no publicity that would n't already have been provided by the newspaper articles already about it . 
  like any `` effect '' , the streissand effect is not universal . 
  i do n't think it will apply here at all . 
  because it seems to be connected to a neo-nazi group , and refugee housing has been targeted for arson . 
  i honestly doubt that . 
  summary executions are well known to cool down internal conflicts . 
  they are western countries , but they are n't part of western europe . 
  neither is norway , really . 
  northern europe or `` the nordic countries '' ( norden ) is a much better designation , given our shared history and culture . 
   given how hyperactively certain / r/europe [ 1 ] is that both of those places are european . 
  come again ? 
  even the suggestion that turkey very well could be considered part of europe is often met with shocked indignation . 
  the historian in me says turkey is part of europe . 
  and , as we all know , history is by far the best - y. 
  ^ ^ ^ trigonometry ^ ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ off . 
  refugee camps do n't seem too much different to * nazi death camps * ? 
  come off it . 
   westerns tend to interpret that as classy , well-to-do single family houses with gardens and stuff , reasonably safe places . 
  we do ?
