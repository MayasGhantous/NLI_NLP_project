  all other germanic languages , as far as i know , use the same way of saying the words twenty to ninety , except danish . 
  even icelanders , and they 're positively norse . 
  besides , you should n't trust everything you read online , even comics . 
  although you should definitely trust everything i say . 
  norwegians ca n't lie . 
  what is pronunciation if not `` the way people say things '' ? 
  again , this is n't that hard once you know how it works , but saying half - [ something ] for values like 50 , 70 and 90 is n't at all like the other germanic languages . 
  halv is n't just pronunciation either , it does literally mean `` half '' . 
  it 's an actual property of their counting system . 
  to make it even more confusing , values like 60 and 80 do n't use the half-method , nor do they line up in the regular `` three  thirty '' and `` four  forty '' way most languages do ( and that danish also uses for 30 and 40 . 
  in english six relates to sixty , in norway it 's seks and seksti , and i 'm pretty sure it 's similar in dutch . 
  in danish it 's seks and tres ( which seems like it would relate more to three/tre . ), 
  it 's not the right system or the wrong system , it 's just a system . 
  so `` two half threes '' and `` three half fives '' made perfect sense to you ? 
  i mean , it 's not rocket science , but i sure as hell needed to have it explained to me when i first heard it . 
   oh well , norway used to be one of the poorest countries in europe , and this helped them kick start their economy , and today it 's one of the best places in the world to live . 
  you 're welcome , norway . 
  i hate to be that guy - wait . . no , i love being that guy - but norway actually had a very high standard of living before any oil was found . 
  we 've got an even higher standard of living now , of course , so there 's that . 
  harstad is clearly the most beaut - i ca n't even say it . 
  i 'm pretty sure you misunderstood it , because danish counting * definitely * does n't just differ in pronunciation . 
  the `` two and fifty '' part is n't the confusing part . 
  we say both fifty-two and two and fifty in norway . 
  20 % is a far cry from `` three guys '' , but i 've seen that too . 
  unless you 're british and you miss empire . 
  that 's what they 're speculating , anyway . 
  not really that surprising . 
  if you go far enough back everyone is either the ancestor of everyone alive today or the ancestor of no one . 
  oh look , the / r/european brigade has arrived . 
  your message is so on point you * almost * managed to get op above 0 despite no one else but you seeing this post . 
  do n't forget b\u00e5huslen . 
  thelocal would n't do that !, 
  the us congress is controlled by the jews ? 
  what is this , 1935 ? 
  yes . 
  particularly because of the fact that the negotiations have been kept completely secret , and the only thing we know about it has come from leaks ( in norway , anyway ) . 
  yeah , i figured that might be the case . 
  i just could n't be arsed to find the stats to prove it because i thought `` death squads '' was good enough a reason . 
  yep , that 's fair . 
   chile under pinochet is another example , which outperformed the whole south america . 
  economically . 
  you still probably would n't want to * live * there . 
  you know , death squads and all . 
  i think that might actually have been sort of his point , considering the coup came with the aid of the us . 
  i suppose that might have been * your * point , but better safe than sorry . 
   i 've actually seen them referred to as ` the devil ' here ( no joke ) you might not be joking , but i 'm pretty sure they were . 
  this guy is pining for a race and/or religion war . 
  i do n't think you and he would agree what constitutes barbarism . 
  yeah , i expect british secondary language education is much like norwegian third language education . 
  i had german myself , but i would n't say i * know * german . 
  i could possibly manage to make myself understood . 
  i think the world is just going to get more bilingual . 
  kids in norway already learn two foreign languages , and have for a while now . 
  i can see why bilingualism is so foreign to brits , simply because you * have * the `` world language '' . 
  people wo n't willingly let go of their languages , though , trust me . 
  a hundred years ? 
  literally impossible . 
  norwegian will probably incorporate more and more english words , but then we always have incorporated words from other languages . 
  i do n't think the world will ever have a single primary language . 
  the reason english has taken over in the british isles is that english was the language of the rulers for so long . 
  you could probably get away with only speaking english in norway for a good while before people started getting annoyed . 
  besides , norwegian is n't that hard once you get used to the master race letters \u00e6 \u00f8 \u00e5 . 
  almost all norwegians speak english . 
  yeah . 
  i 'm not a big poetry guy , but i always liked that one . 
  aaah , shakespeare . 
  who thought fortinbras sounded like a solid , norwegian name . 
  you are either slightly mad or slightly drunk . 
  really , just on the basis of the original being in norwegian . 
  \u00d8verland himself did n't translate it to english , that was much later . 
  or if he did , i do n't know about it . 
  it does n't mean the english translation is n't powerful , it just maybe does n't carry the exact intent of \u00d8verland at all times , as you can imagine . 
  still a great poem in english . 
  i 'm just one of those people who do n't like reading english books translated to norwegian , for example , so i like seeing the original as intended . 
  norwegian : http://www.barnasrett.no/dikt/du_ma_ikke_sove.htm english : http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2005/06/30/436130.html considering it was released in 1936 , it 's pretty damn spot on , particularly these verses :  dare not to slumber !, 
  dare not to sleep !, 
   dare not believe , it was merely a dream !, 
   yore i was judged . 
   the gallows were built in the court this evening ,  they 'll come for me -- 5 ' in the morning -  and then you defy : this dare not be true !, 
   that men can be utterly evil . 
   there has to be some one with merits pure  oh , brother , you still have a great deal to learn -  pardon them not - they know what they do !, 
   they breathe on hate-glows , and evil pursue ,  they fancy to slay , they revel with cries ,  their desire is to gloat , when our world is at fire !, 
   in blood they are yearning to drown one and all !, 
   do n't you believe it ? 
  you 've heard the call !, 
  -  ** and then they 'll leave home for a rainfall of steel ** ,  ** ` till last they hang ragged on barbed wire will , **  ** decaying for hitler 's aryan call , **  ** that is what a man 's for - after all ... ** -  ** i weighed : something is imminent - and it 's dire **  ** our era is over -- europe 's on fire !, 
   im not sure if theo van gogh 's dead made international news , i would be very surprised if it did . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  i am pretty sure it was all over norwegian media . 
  i have n't downvoted you , and i do n't think others should downvote you either . 
  i fully agree with you on the purges , and i responded to that person myself further down a comment chain . 
  i did not mean to claim any kind of arbitrary authority on the subject , only to make the point that the general idea of a soviet mass charge tactic is a myth . 
  the reason i have n't presented any sources myself is because / r/askhistorians exists , and the question has been brought up many times ( you found a few of them yourself ) . 
  i * do * have books on the subject ( although i do n't remember them bringing this up ) , but i felt there was no need to go searching through them for something that is n't really that controversial . 
  i have a masters in history , but i felt it was n't useful to bring it up as that * would * have been an appeal to authority . 
  i honestly do n't know what you 're on about here . 
  i have never dismissed anything , i was making the point that you * should n't * dismiss sources out of hand . 
  i have never read your source , so how could i dismiss it ? 
  let 's go back to the original comment i took issue with :  soviets were known to send soldiers in attack waves that had no chance of victory , or send them in the fight without enough ammunition or weapons . 
  considering we were talking about the war and soviet warfare in general , and in the context of `` would millions of soviets have died regardless ?
