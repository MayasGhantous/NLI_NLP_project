  how do you figure the polish state is going to manage to continue functioning if you drastically lower tax income ? 
  i assume you want to have roads , police stations and hospitals . 
  and maybe even a military , if you 're worried about the russians . 
  there 's no way in hell * half * of all norwegians are `` quarter millionaires '' in euros . 
  at the very least the subject matter has to be net worth . 
  that would make more sense , since it is much more common to own your own home in norway than many other european countries . 
  that does n't have anything to do with a lack of egalitarianism , though . 
  norway is one of the most egalitarian countries in europe . 
  this makes some countries seem really willing to strike , but can it not also simply show the proportion of the work force in unions ? 
  we do n't have that many strikes in norway , but when we do a lot of people are involved because we have very high union membership . 
  we had the same teacher dispute in norway as you did in denmark , except we did n't get a lock out and the results were far from as dire . 
  oh yes , it 's definitely a small-steps kind of thing . 
  we 've already had trials with 6-hour work days in norway in certain businesses . 
  statistics have also shown that a majority of norwegians would rather have one day more off work than higher pay . 
  i think it could be the future , but it 'll have to come slowly . 
  it 's not as far out as it seems . 
  there 's no doubt that the future will see more and more people pushed out of work because of mechanization and computerization . 
  if everyone works slightly less more people can work . 
  of course , if employment is high already that 's not really an issue . 
   those who come from bnackwards cultures break those and impede progress . 
  i would think you would be hesitant to make such claims , considering what some ( bigoted ) people would say about anything from eastern european culture in general to more specific romanian/moldovan . 
  sure . 
  but if i was a pretentious photographer who wanted to capture the essence of a people or a place , i probably would n't . 
  where are all the unattractive people ? 
  i often get the impression the `` faces of x '' - type photo series very heavily favour taking pretty pictures of pretty people . 
  mostly girls , of course . 
  in many cases it still is . 
  there 's always a certain theme to stories from thelocal . 
  quite . 
  he 's gone off the deep end now . 
  according to wikipedia ( your source ) the danish border was first crossed ** 04:15 ** on the 9th of april . 
  at ** 04:21 ** the bl\u00fccher was attacked well on its way up the oslofjord towards oslo . 
  if that does n't count as simultaneous , i do n't know what does . 
  it goes without saying that norway 's geography meant it could not be conquered in a single day , as with denmark . 
  denmark could still be a staging area for operations in norway without being crucial to the very initial invasion . 
  i do n't know what your definition of a `` full scale invasion '' is , but capturing the capital as well as all the major population centres seems like it fits . 
  either way your original claim was that it was not a surprise invasion of norway , which is factually wrong . 
  ( admittedly wikipedia is inconsistent in timing of various attacks , but either way the invasions were well within an hour of each other ), 
  they started a world war over poland . 
  they failed them , but they did n't betray them . 
  they ( and britain ) betrayed czechoslovakia . 
  they failed to directly help poland ( which may or may not have been wise ) , but they did n't outright betray them . 
  the guy who ordered the attack that sunk the bl\u00fccher , killing up to a thousand german troops meant for occupying the capital and capturing the royal family , * did n't know who he was shooting at * . 
  he only knew that there were foreign warships sailing up the oslofjord . 
  the thing about norway is that all the major population centres are at the coast , and most are in the south . 
  they were all occupied within hours . 
  the norwegian occupation government were nazi sympathisers , though , since the true norwegian government refused to cooperate and fled into exile in london . 
  it 's true that many ordinary norwegians still cooperated . 
  particularly the police force was shamefully cooperative with the nazis , contrasted with teachers , journalists and priests . 
   most of the norwegians are not people of etiquette . 
  they do n't like to shake hands and feign emotional distress when they say good bye . 
  at best , they nod their heads , and they are , for the most part , rather taciturn nothing has changed . 
  time ... time never changes . 
  the kalmar union was good if you were danish , though . 
  the rest of us did n't fancy it all that much . 
  it 's probably just a case of poor wording . 
  occupied poland would be better . 
  as a teacher , i can confirm that pisa rankings mean a lot less to teachers than they do to politicians and the media , for whom the worth of the entire educational system is easily quantifiable . 
  i do n't know what you think , but i have to admit i 've seen some of your posts in here before , and i generally have n't thought many kind words about them . 
  but you 're american , you 're bound to have different views on the roles of europe and the us in nato and the future of the organization . 
  all i ask is that you understand that this is a european subreddit where people , generally europeans but not always , will discuss things from a european perspective . 
  / r/europe is far from perfect ( it sometimes goes in waves ) , but it is what it is . 
  you 're surprised that in a discussion about a european country possibly joining nato in / r/europe , europeans are discussing the potential for an eu army ? 
  i do n't understand how that , to you , constitutes a cirklejerk and semantics , and * not an actual discussion * . 
  i 'm also not sure you should be accusing people of hiding behind semantics to avoid discussion when you yourself use so many words and phrases presumably designed to get an edge : referring to people ( the very people you 're inevitably debating , no less ) coming * out of the woodwork * , talking about a cirklejerk , putting the word `` convenient '' in quotation marks as to imply some sort of ... what ? 
  low level conspiracy ? 
  who are they ? 
  if you 're referring to tas121790 , i have to say that claiming something is semantics does n't make it so . 
  i does . 
  does n't you ? 
  you 're missing the point , though . 
  we are individuals and we do not represent our countries . 
  it does n't matter what the relative levels of armament in our countries are , because it does n't impact the discussion in any way . 
  it 's just like how you 're an american and yet you 've probably got hundreds of posts in / r/europe . 
  there are countries in this thread ? 
  i do n't know , to me it looks like there 's just a few individuals discussing relevant issues . 
  maybe you 're used to representing your country wherever you go , but i 'm just a person with opinions , not norway embodied . 
  further translation : i 'm a fucking idiot, 
  of course he can . 
  this is the guy who said that striking workers should be fired . 
   so as eu socialism and bureucracy is one of the reasons why president founded liberland , you can forgot on eu membership . 
  riiiiiiight . 
  i think i 'll stay up here . 
  that is certainly the case for scandinavia . 
  up until very recently every newborn in norway was registered as a member of the church if one of their parents was a member . 
  i was never baptized as a child , and my parents never had me join the church , but i was still a member . 
  i do n't think we really use that in norwegian , at least i ca n't recall ever hearing it . 
  perhaps we have an impression of the government being more national , whether it is or it is n't . 
  yeah , i guess that 's a fair enough statement . 
  i know , i 'm norwegian . 
  oslo still does n't forbid anything . 
  saying `` oslo forbids it '' is pretty silly . 
  sure , but a majority of puerto ricans actually want to become a full state . 
  i definitely expect them to end up as a state eventually . 
  they ca n't go on like this forever . 
  puerto rico * is * part of the usa though . 
  nope . 
   despite that so many people are apparantly feeling troubled about this ` throwaway account ' , i simply judge this post on its contents . 
  the guy even provided a link and refrained from in my eyes unwanted statements , which should be enough . 
  the problem lies in the answer to the question `` why is n't he posting on his main account ? '' .
