  question ... 
  does bonnie tyler sound any different with or without a cold ? 
  hey , united kingdom ? 
  have you picked an excuse yet , or do you actually want to see yourattempt first before deciding ? 
  alternatively with a bunch of gay people who actually takes it seriously , getting all catty over any trash-talk about * their * favourite . 
  patronyms were the rule for common people in norway for centuries . 
  only the nobility or royalty used house names . 
  there are pretty much four main rules to names in norway . 
  patronyms , such as hansen/hanssen , which would stem from `` son of hans '' . 
  names taken from homesteads and farms , very common after the 1923 law on names was introduced . 
  the last name '' \u00d8deg\u00e5rd / \u00d8degaard '' , which derives largely from the above . 
  '' \u00d8deg\u00e5rd '' means `` desolate farm '' , and just about every town , village or assembly of more than a few farms , had some place named '' \u00d8deg\u00e5rd '' after the black plague . 
  there * matriculas * have a few hundred places described as this , and thousands of places with variations , and about 1 in every 1000 norwegians has a last name based from that . 
  patronyms from professions , such as `` m\u00f8llersen '' , which would be `` son of the miller '' , not unlike `` smith/smithson '' in english/american . 
  it has also been given to yasser arafat , shimon peres and yitzhak rabin . 
  perhaps the biggest joke of all . 
  just one thing ... what 's up with the completely random blotches around iceland , in practically uninhabited areas ? 
  someone in raufarh\u00f6fn won the lottery ? 
  does the income of the employees as borgarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur eystri airport really pull the average up that much ? 
  i would guess that would be rural and hilly areas . 
  grape and cork farms are n't exactly powerhouses in the financial market . 
  if you had n't resisted 900 years ago , this could have been you . 
  of course . 
  but despite some outliers , post-tax income is still relatively evenly distributed , which means that the majority of us is somewhere near average net income . 
  we 're extremely well off in things like post-tax gini coefficients . 
  you forgot to carry the zero in that second step . 
  there are differences , but income disparity is not overwhelming . 
  any household with two incomes will have at least one 40 '' + size tv , and in most cases the family hey own their house , rather than rent . 
  they will go to gran canaria or tenerife for vacations ever so often . 
  a family is very unlikely to live poorly on two incomes , unless they 're living in oslo , bergen , stavanger , trondheim or troms\u00f8 , where living costs are elevated due to the insanity of the real estate market . 
  i would guess `` high disposable income '' , simple as that . 
  a lot of that comes from a significant disparity on property prices . 
  out in the most godforsaken parts of the country , you can get a [ 176 m \u00b2 house at nok 440 000 , - . 
  ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=38051094&amp;areaid=20449 ) ( comes with a 366 m \u00b2 lot , by the way . ), 
  in oslo , those nok 440.000 , - would cover a downpayment on a < 30m \u00b2 apartment . 
  somewhere between 25 - 50 % of the final sum , depending on your standards and the area . 
  so even working in a low-income job , you 're still financially shiny as long as that low-income job is out in the middle of nowhere . 
  \\ - a norwegian . 
  purchasing power per km ^ 2 says jack shit apart from how densely populated an area is . 
  i 'll give you the same response as we did for two separate eu membership referendums . 
  also the difference between the thirds highest ppp in the world , vs. the tenth . 
  median disposable income disparity of 1.205 , big mac index disparity of 1.268 . 
  in the nordic countries , backstabbing swede jokes never go out of style . 
  the dublin accords were simply not meant to handle something of the magnitude of the current influx of refugees . 
  they were set up as a means to maintain minimum mobility for immigrants , forcing them to relate to the first eu country they arrived in , and letting those countries be stuck with the problem . 
  now we 'll get a nice multi-year argument instead , before some sort of a quota system under a joint policy is created . 
  * the lyrics are fortunately the crowd who partied in 1969 are headed for retirement , while the crowd who partied in 1979 are unfortunately running things . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julebord ' t is the season to drink yourself honest and tell your boss exactly what you think of him , while he 's trying to explain to two of the ladies from accounting that he has hired a suite with a hottub at a nearby hotel , and since he 's using company funds to do so , it 's only fair that they come take a look . 
  i used to work as a bouncer . 
  company christmas party season was the absofuckinglutely worst . 
  the people who maybe allow themselves a drink or two every once in a while suddenly deciding to party like it 's 1979 . 
  i mean , the kids who have just started drinking are shits . 
  but they are little shits who can be put in their place . 
  drunk baby boomers being drunken shits on the other hand ? 
  insufferable . 
  simple . 
  you stick `` based on a true story '' on the cover , whip a composer to come up with the most poignant orchestral soundtrack on this side of schindler 's list , and jam in some scenes of the main character suffering immensely over keeping the illusion alive , while discovering something about himself and his brother . 
  in the end , as the mother is dying , her last words are about how she knew right from the start , but how this was the most heartwarming thing the son ever did for her . 
  this is meant to signify something or other wine-sipping movie critics will argue over . 
  it 'll either become one of those movies that will end up in the filmatic purgatory that is being a drama aired on tv , or it will get oscar nominations . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo0irsfrpq4 short , simple and with powerpoint slides to explain it all . 
  one of our clowns that is supposed to be a member of parliament suggested that a greek island should be bought , and the lot of them just shipped there .
