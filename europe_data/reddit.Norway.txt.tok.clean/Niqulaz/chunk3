  well ... the sane thing to do would be to remove the source of the problem , i.e. 
  the conflicts that turn people into refugees . 
  but when the syrian clusterfuck started back in 2011 , nobody was in any particular hurry to do anything . 
  then isis entered the scene , and people slowly started to give a quarter of a fuck about it all . 
  then the flood of refugees started , and now people are giving about 2.1 fucks about it , but most of those fucks being dedicated to screaming either `` welcome refugees ! '', 
  or `` fuck of !, 
  '' , and the rest being spent yelling `` eu !, 
  do something !!! '', 
  self-correcting problem . 
  http://www.rttnews.com/2530384/norway-unemployment-rate-rises-as-expected-in-may.aspx we 'll just have to hope that it is possible to re-train people from stavanger to speak norwegian almost as comprehensibly as the swedes . 
  i really see no downside to this at all . 
  turkish media : `` 1.5 million armenians decided to go for walk . 
  if anything bad happened to them , it was the kurds who did it . '', 
  was even on the euro coin for a while . 
  also , sometimes as a civil servant , you carry out your orders to the letter of the law and with malice . 
  especially if you know that you carrying out your orders will backfire immensely . 
  is it the worst possible timing for this to happen ? 
  does it make a lick of difference as the laws are in effect ? 
  not at all . 
  i 'm not sure if i 've acutally come across a good english term for it , but i know what you refer to . 
  `` foreldelse '' is the term used in norwegian . 
  however , we only use it for whether or not someone can be charged with a crime . 
  having been sentenced , in case of prisons being filled to capacity , you will stay on waiting lists until capacity is freed up . 
  early parole and/or partially suspended sentences are also see extensive use . 
  especially partial suspension is extensively used for `` first time offenders '' , letting for instance two thirds of a sentence being partially suspended . 
  which means that any repeat offender gets the fun of serving both a new sentence , and the suspended part of their previous sentence . 
  i assume the same parliament majority that is the foundation of the government , was somehow involved in passing the law amendment in march this year , which allowed for transfer to sentence under electronic surveilance to happen sooner for prisoners though . 
  so it 's not the prime minister passing a pardon as one of his first acts in office , just some long-term effects of policies passed before the current mess . 
  [ more detailed article from grapevine.is ] ( http://grapevine.is/news/2016/04/07/jailed-bankers-to-be-freed/ ) if i were to guess , the icelandic prison service , looking at the calendar , sighing , thinking `` this will surely make people less angry . '', 
  what were the words ? 
  `` it 's not like the entire nation is protesting outside . '', 
  space cowboys . 
  are you crazy ? 
  pirates were awesome at quite a few things the labour unions have been trying to get back ever since . 
  inclusive employment , for instance . 
  did n't matter what skin colour or background you had . 
  as long as you were willing to plunder and suffer life at sea , you were welcome . 
  and that 's before you even start considering employment options for those with disabilities . 
  no discrimination against someone missing an eye , or having a peg-leg , or being a hand short . 
  henry morgan 's crew even had a code that allowed for a pension to any man that became to crippled to work while serving as crew . 
  most even had a pre-determined tariff on shares from plunder . 
  and of course part 3 : this night on / r/europe : iceland pm : i did not resign . 
  i 'm just on a break . 
  i think it would mean having one of their 4 ( ? ), 
  coast guard vessels hanging around the reykjavik harbour in a menacing way . 
  `` hmmm ... 
  somehow , we did n't think this all the way through . '', 
  that was more of a `` i said i would if i did n't get results '' and ukip responding with `` nah mate , you 're still good to drive , have another ! '', 
  it is pretty damn certain that his political future is a joke at best . 
  so this is clinging to straws . 
  and telling his coalition that he will bring the house down if they even consider supporting a motion of no confidence . 
  that way , he will at least feel he has the right to say that he did nothing wrong , because he was never put on trial and the parilament never gave the vote of no confidence . 
  this is turning into the level of ridiculous that makes your name into a term for posterity . 
  `` we want your resignation . 
  and no sigmunduring it ! '', 
  http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/04/05/prime_minister_has_not_resigned_sends_press_release/ madness ? 
  this ... is ... 
  iceland !!, 
  sooo ... can he start shouting `` psyche ! '', 
  before angry mob o ' clock in the afternoon from now on ? 
  because otherwise the angry mob will have to reschedule for the next afternoon again . 
  and that is just poor etiquette . 
  ] ( http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/04/05/prime_minister_has_not_resigned_sends_press_release/ ), 
  yes . 
  you would n't dare to . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ c'mon , ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ ^ fucking ^ ^ ^ ^ funny, 
  i think something like 2/3 of the total population of iceland lives within an hour from parliament . 
  the other third probably has a cousin whose couch they can crash on . 
  and now he 's been forced to resign because the icelanders would prefer to have an ethical prime minister . 
  they can . 
  question is whether that will make people be quiet and go home . 
  bjarni benediktsson , leader of the independence party ( the other party of the coalition ) and minister of finance and economic , has been implicated already . 
  people have just had time to get angry with the prime minister for a while longer . 
  now that they 've been riled up and made to demonstrate anyway , they might as well call for a new head . 
  and i think i 've seen articles suggesting several other members of parliament has been named in the panama papers . 
  which means that there will be lots of calls for lots of heads . 
  less military and less police = more of a chance to realize that making a lot of people angry is a bad idea . 
  well ... 
  i guess it also helps to have a military that largely exists only in theory ( apart from coast guard vessels ) , and a police force of 850-900 total officers in the entire country . 
  it 's a miracles nobody has overthrown the government as one of those brilliant ideas you get at 3am after a pub crawl . 
   we do n't even have a government sooo ... whoever is the soberest at the moment runs the country ? 
  i want to make it clear that i 'm not happy with these current developments !, 
  i have an ma in political science , and i did n't remember to buy popcorn until today . 
  i have yet to make my first kettle of popcorn , and now you do this to my entertainment ? 
  i would very much like for a very loud debate on a snap election for the remained of the week , as well as some dirty plays and controversies , so that i 'll be able to handle the supply of popcorn i now have sitting around . 
  edit : never mind . 
  the bag of crazy you elected as prime minister is the gift that just keeps on giving . 
  i 'm gon na need more popcorn . 
  it 's dubious whether he has broken any laws or not . 
  he has broken code of conduct as a member of parliament , failing to disclose his holdings in the company ( and been a shitty character , as well as proving himself to be somewhat arrogant and a bit delusional the last few days ) . 
  of couse , i 'm pretty sure there are some people who would like to talk to him , and try to make sure he has n't broken any laws . 
  `` he would not like to be a hnefatafl-piece '' / s, 
  independence would either want to avoid a new election due to bad press at the moment , of be part of a vote of no confidence , saving face to some degree going into an election . 
  turning down a motion of no confidence in parliament and saving the government would be the least favourable course of action , that would lead to getting slaughtered in the 2017 elections unless they gave everyone a unicorn over the course of the next year . 
  or am i way off ? 
  being a piece in this one , would not be clever . 
  `` one of the last things done in office , was to help sigmundur dav\u00ed\u00f0 leave office with a shred of dignity left . '', 
  witches rarely consider the economic or social effects of their actions . 
  witchhunters were notoriously bad at considering the carbon footprint of * their * actions though , so it swings both ways . 
  i do n't think `` thinking '' is this guy 's strong suit at the moment .
