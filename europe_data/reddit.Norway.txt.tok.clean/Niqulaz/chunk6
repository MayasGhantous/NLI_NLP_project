  france made me realize i had to . 
  latvia , russia and poland seems real strong contenders this year . 
  this is not from a qualitative perspective , but rather from the cheesy awful pop-or-powerballad level . 
  russia with the cheeky acapella-pause that makes it a high-scoring contribution regardless of any politics . 
  that the one !, 
  perpetually out of breath when she sings . 
  there are things even autotune ca n't fix . 
  it 's as if bj\u00f6rk and that wheezy chick who sang the song for fifty shades had a lovechild with kate bush . 
  edit : any brits wan na help me with the name of the wheezy chick ? 
  lithuania 's eyebrows have me tantralized and hypnotized . 
  i now know how a cobra feels when confronted by a snakecharmer . 
  i had to hit the john to drop a. . . esc contribution during the number before cyprus . 
  what did i miss ? 
  here we are . 
  the power ballad that will score ** a lot ** of points . 
  beer will not suffice for this . 
  i need to break out the booze for this . 
  so we 're doomed ? 
  this is annoyingly catchy . 
  why is this annoyingly catchy !? 
  to be honest ... we do not know any longer . 
  sometimes generic pop wins . 
  sometimes some folksy piece wins . 
  sometimes finnish monster metal wins . 
  just drink booze and find something to hold on to . 
  in case it has n't been posted yet , the handy guide to where to send your twelve points : http://i.imgur.com/y9ijjvi.jpg, 
  if you 're baltic , and have a solid song to boot . 
  i knew something was amiss . 
  i had forgotten about the / r/europe esc party . 
  also , proper winters . 
  ( fuck you oslo , and your sad , pathetic excuses for winters ! ), 
  the guy who played tony stark/iron man . 
  it has only been 22 years since the warsaw pact fell apart . 
  that 's more or less the blink of an eye in a historical perspective . 
  as long as states feel threatened , and someone offers them protection , new coalitions will form for the purpose of deterring the use of violence . 
  balance of power is not a permanent condition . 
  since 1990 , there has been one single hegemon . 
  unfortunately said hegemon has been overtly fond of bombing countries full of sand and oil , and generally creating quite unfavourable conditions for anyone who is n't the hegemon itself . 
  china 's rise as a potential superpower will attract other states , feeling threatened or otherwise inconvenienced by the u.s. hegemony , who will seek alliances in order to maintain their own safety . 
  especially if the us keeps running roughshod around in the middle east and declaring states threats and al queda safe havens left and right . 
  despite the fact that many international relations scholars also gets all flushed and want to touch themselves in inappropriate ways whenever the name kenneth waltz gets mentioned , i still prefer the realist approach . 
  yes . 
  that would be what i was trying to say , only with significantly less derp . 
  i was almost fucking et up out on iona back in september . 
  even had a go at my feet , inside of my shoes and socks . 
  a system with two superpowers is more in balance than a system with one . 
  plus , if they can duke it out over the atlantic rather than in our direction , then even better . 
  he 's right !, 
  sure . 
  the uk will throw you alluring glances , but if he liked it then he should have put a schengen agreement on it . 
  you forgot that bit about running around in a skirt in a country where the vegetation is either heather , nettle or thistle . 
  and clouds of gnats will blot out the sun . 
  hull . 
  of course , that might just be a personal opinion . 
  we already tried that once . 
  not recommended . 
  you might suddenly find yourself lacking all the greenlands you used to have . 
  do n't blame me , i voted for irish redheaded lasses . 
  i was confused at first because i read legend to the right and not the left of the bars , and wondered if the majority identified as `` mostly heterosexual '' . 
  `` i 'm straight , unless robert downey jr. asks . 
  then i 'm a little bi-curious . '', 
  they are rather good at it . 
  they even devote a feast to it . 
  you might have heard of it ? 
  octoberfest ? 
  step 2 : buy stocks in companies that produce chainlink and fenceposts . 
  step 3 : profit . 
   and goes step by step to legally become what they wish scotland : `` yeeeah . 
  we just wanted to let you know that we 're joining schengen . 
  hope you do n't have a problem with that , england . '', 
  trollface.jpg that would be fun to see . 
  not for any other particular reason other than to see how the uk would react . 
  based on the actions and attitude of the sub-sect known as reddit atheists , i would rather prefer ** not ** to be associated with atheism ( although reddit atheism is rather misotheism , more than anything else ) . 
  just because i have a non-religious attitude , that does n't mean that i actively reject the potential existence of a god or a multitude of gods , it just means that i 'm non-religious due to not giving a shit . 
  if the entire greek pantheon decided to have a parade through the streets tomorrow , that would have little or no bearing on my life , apart from the traffic congestion it would cause . 
  fuck no . 
  i lack holier-than-thou attitude , as well as the active action of denying/disbelieving the existence of deities . 
  apatheism is closer to agnosticism . 
  but while agnosticism concludes that they do not know whether deities exist or not , apatheism simply does n't care whether deities exist or not , and ca n't be bothered to go check . 
  i ended up voting for finland . 
  but you 're a good fourth place behind finland , russia and ireland . 
  the potential scottish independence will push you down to fifth place . 
  personally , i 'm an apatheist . 
  i just ca n't be bothered to care about religion . 
  yet we feature on the $ 2 coin , despite not having joined the union any more since eurocoindonggate . 
  who is to blame for the decision to cut norway from the map ? 
  we probably did n't ask to be omitted from the map of europe . 
  but at some point , some designer decided that this was the way to go , and i like to believe that there might even have been some quality assurance along the way here . 
  at some point , several people have said `` nah ... nobody could possibly think that this looks like a flacid penis . '', 
  that being said , now that the european central bank has provided us with props , it would be a damn shame to not rub people 's face in ... essentially `` southern finland '' . 
  i have no idea . 
  she looks either icelandic or norwegian . 
  that 's all i 've got . 
  it 's a new `` member '' survey , in order to find out who imitates the old [ euro coin ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o4tey.jpg ) more accurately . 
  i would n't say that i 'm a `` europhile '' * per se * . 
  i mean , i do love europe ... as friend . 
  `` here . 
  oh , and by the way , how about letting those customs barriers slip a bit , eh ? '', 
  i really do n't see any reason to rage over * that * . 
  rather , the timing is interesting .
