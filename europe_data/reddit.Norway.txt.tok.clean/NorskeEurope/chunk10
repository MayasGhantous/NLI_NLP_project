  the sanctions themself are a non-sequitur - sanctions are not placed as a response to propaganda * . 
  * anywhere except the us and north korea . 
   shale gas to lng is a long , long process , and it 's not something that is locked-in from one supplier-unlike a pipeline . 
  it does n't matter if the natural gas is pumped out of a shale well in north dakota or south dakota , as soon as its pumped out it gets to market . 
  you guys have way too much natural gas and need to sell it somewhere . 
  [ us natural gas export capacity is about to explode ] ( https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30052 ) . 
   the fact that there are people doing mental gymnastics to claim that trump is somehow friendly with russia , and is trying to divide them from europe ( despite having said sanctions forced on him by congress ) , like i said , good cop / bad cops . 
  it does n't fool anyone here . 
   trump is fooling himself , putin , the gop , and the dems . 
  wow , he sure is sly - fooling everyone but you read the article , he 's fooling people in the us but * no one in europe * . 
  you do n't just build billions of dollars in export terminals that will be able to export tens of billions in natural gas per year without trying to secure customers , and that 's what this bill does . 
  [ within two years , us lng export capacity will be 5t cubic-foot , excess that of nordstream 2 ! ] ( https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30052 ) . 
  [ nordstream will only be 3.9 t cubic foot ] http://uk.reuters.com/article/energy-gazprom-pipeline-idukl5n0z42ob20150618 ) . 
   remarkably , non-trump politicians really are just very angry about russia 's blatant interference in our elections - which so far has vastly harmed the u.s. and been costless to russia . 
  then i guess american politicians are just really different , because everyone else has been putting up with this stuff from russia for decades . 
  you secure your computers and tell people not to watch russian propaganda networks , the us response is like responding to some guy who called your dad a jerk by burning down the guys * and his neighbor 's * house . 
  edit : i have to thank you for this discussion , doing background researches on this really makes it clear what the motivation is , and why the eu is right to block these sanctions . 
  i want to stand against putin but this not the right way to do it :d, 
  actions speak louder than words , and trumps actions have all been to drive a wedge between europe and russia and hurt european business interests . 
  now he 's on the cusp of sending billions to states that voted for him . 
  all trump had to do to get everyone on his side was invite some russian reporters to the white house , its pretty transparent . 
   out of total u.s. natural gas exports - 0.4 % went to europe . 
  link that 's the point !, 
  you have massive infrastructure to export lng , but no one is buying it !, 
  despite this , [ it is being expanded ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/13/us-become-worlds-largest-natural-gas-exporter.html ) yet china does n't [ really want us lng ] ( https://www.adn.com/business-economy/energy/2017/05/25/governor-touts-u-s-china-deal-as-helping-alaska-lng-but-analysts-are-doubtful/ ) so what to do ? 
  create a market by stopping europe from buying russian gas . 
  i 'm not saying the motives are `` nefarious '' just self interested . 
  and trump being a `` russophile idiot '' is just part of the good cop bad cop routine , its not fooling us . 
  so far everything trump has done has soured relations with russia , he 's expanded the war in syria and actually struck assad directly . 
  these sanctions is a huge benefit to areas that voted for trump , and to get everyone behind it ( and even fool some europeans ) all he had to do was invite some russian reporters or whatever to the white house . 
  like i said before , look at shales gas producing states , they all voted for trump . 
  this is a hand out to trump 's voters , trump is just playing good cop bad cop with congress but it is not foolish anyone in europe . 
   seriously ? 
  trump is a putin lackey - his staff tried hard to water down the sanctions and prevent them from being pass . 
  this is like a bad romance novel where the woman says `` no , '' it might trick people in the us , but it is not fooling us . 
  the states that will benefit from increased gas exports all voted for trump . 
  as i said no one in europe is fooled by the show . 
   it goes far beyond simple propaganda and misinformation . 
  it involved coordinated cyberattack on us electoral institutions and private citizens by the russian government . 
  [ yup , that 's a regular thing . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia ) does n't call for sanctions though , and certainly not sanctions that hurt our businesses . 
  sorry if i am also suspicious , since these sanctions will go a long way in helping us industry and promoting it . 
  [ the us has a glut of natural gas and they just propose two months ago to export it ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-05/natural-gas-exports-can-solve-u-s-energy-glut ) , [ the states with the most production all voted trump ] ( https://www.targetmap.com/viewer.aspx?reportid=37686 ) . 
  ( except for california but % oil and gas is a tiny portion of their economy ) . 
  trump is probably pushing this behind the scenes to help us industry . 
  him making some noise against it just encourages it to be passed even more . . as an american you should be familiar with good cop / bad cop . 
  for context , in norway , we would benefit from this sanction too , since price for our natural gas would go up , but still i do n't like to see the us take advantage of europe . 
  people also care about people dying from nuclear power . 
  it 's only when they are killed by any other sort of industrial pollution that no one cares . 
  these sanctions are just trump trying to give his republican states more exports of gas and industry to us , it directly benefits his voters . 
  this whole thing where it seems like maybe he does n't want more sanctions is a transparent show that does n't fool anyone in the eu . 
  the good cop/bad cop does not trick us . 
  russia `` election hacking '' is really standard and should just be called russian news/propaganda and it 's something we have been dealing with for decades . 
  it 's not a international crime like the invasion of another country , sanctions are meant for countries that breakaway international law , not influence people 's in ways you do n't like . 
  it 's great and easy for trump to say we should trade less with russia when it is us who will lost jobs . 
  so french is actually an italian language :o, 
   sure , but what would the punishment be for participating in isis if there is not direct evidence of her battlefield activities ? 
  all the way over in germany many witnesses will be unable to testify . 
  german investigators will not dare travel to an active war zone to gather evidence . 
  difficulty in obtaining evidence does not mean that people should by default be found guilty . 
  we already take a large number of refugee and furthermore we already have expensive housing and shortages . 
  a huge number of german jobs depend on cheaper gas from russia and exports to russia . 
  it 's not so easy as people want to present it , implementing sanctions the way trump and others seem to want would cost a lot of money to germany . 
  i do n't understand where this assumption is that trump would veto it . 
  is there anything to indicate he would , a statement for example ? 
  i really do n't like trump , but there 's been no foreign policy action on trumps part that indicates he 's pro-russia . 
  he did n't even grant exxon an exemption to do joint oil projects in russia . 
  merkel has been more `` pro-russian '' ( justifiably so due to the number of jobs dependent on exports to russia and the need for russian gas ) . 
  this should clear things up : https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080907191205aaajkqm, 
  uh , yeah ... arresting people for simply being `` enemy combatants '' is not legal . 
  that 's what bush did in guantanamo bay . 
  people need to be found guilty of something or they should be rehabilitated . 
  how about we put our ideals into action and allow these people the chance to re-integrate into society such as denmark does ? 
  people who want to leave isis and renounce their crimes should be allowed a chance to be rehabilitated . 
  hundreds of thousands of jobs , probably millions depend on german car industry . 
  also i would point out that us manufacturers get huge subsidies , each tesla car gets more than $ 7000 tax payer subsidy . 
  the us is not playing fair either . 
  this is really not comparable to google monopoly behavior or the sort of things trump proposes to protect corporate profit - these industries are the backbone of the german state and making sure they do n't eat each other alive in competition insures hundreds of thousands of jobs and the economic center of europe . 
  well maybe you can hire trump to build a wall for you to keep out all the scary foreigners . 
  some of them may be , but there are also likely isis fighters who became disillusioned and are simply looking to start a new life . 
  deporting people to an unsafe country where they could face torture , forced military conscription and worse is not a solution . 
  the ehrc did great work in stopping an ongoing violation of human rights . 
  returning people to an unsafe country is not a plan . 
   this is false . 
  the government did n't block their donations , independent financial companies did . 
  good . 
  even if they are n't breaking any laws at the least private companies can have some morals and stop the far right . 
  respecting the humanity of all is fundamental to the eu , saving these people is a core eu value . 
  these groups stand against everything the eu does . 
  these are racist far right organization which wants to bring people back to a country currently [ suffering from mass torture and human rights violations ] ( https://www.google.no/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewj9jjyru5vvahuh5omkhyxudqoqfggomaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.hrw.org%2fnews%2f2017%2f01%2f12%2flibya-armed-groups-detain-torture-kill&amp;usg=afqjcng2tcvlqsvlfknxdkom31c3_u8-ww ) . 
   the only thing ` the left ' does is say you have to treat any citizen equally . 
  the left also stands for the right of refuge and ensuring basic human rights , and parts of the right also stand for this too , happily ( merkel ) . 
  it 's the far right that wants to build walls and close the borders . 
  furthermore , even if it were convicted criminals it would most likely reflect bias on the part of the police and justice system . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-racism-racial-stereotype-african-descent-black-united-nations-un-police-authorities-customs-a7603771.html germany badly needs a more diverse police force which reflects the communities they police . 
  part of that is one of the reasons why there have been moves to get american bases out of germany and japan . 
  its mostly due to prejudice of the police . 
  he 's collecting a salary from something he believes should n't exist . 
  it 's quite different for the snp which wants to remain in the eu and achieve independence from the uk but still take part in legislation until such time as they achieve independence . 
  its not hard to make a vacuum chamber that does n't implode due to slight deformations .
