  turkey already had the responsibility to ensure that human smugglers do not operate from their shores . 
  yet now the eu will wait another year before turkey accepts this responsibility ? 
  that 's another two million immigrants . 
  and anyone can be detained who breaks a law , the only allowable reason for the unauthorized crossing of a border is fleeing danger , but no one is directly arriving in greece from syria , so if someone claiming to be a syrian arrives in greece they may be detained . 
  and actually the geneva refugee convention does allow refugees to be contained in facilities so long as they are safe and cared for there . 
  refugees do not have a right to freedom of movement in their host country . 
  well you seem to accept the premise that turkey will take all new arrivals back . 
  it will never happen . 
  waiting until the eu can deport to turkey is ensuring a never ending flow of refugees . 
  the eu needs to detain all those illegally crossing the border until they can be deported to their country of origin . 
  waiting until turkey solves the problem is what the eu has been doing since the last summer . 
  but a never ending street of immigrants is ** exactly ** what reopening the border insures . 
  merkel has not proposed anything that would ever stop the flow . 
  so long as the border of europe are not controlled and all illegal border crosses returned ( either immediately or after being detained until such a point that they remember where they came from ) the flow will not end . 
  that 's it . 
  that is the european solution . 
  anything short of that insures a never ending flow . 
  if later on germany wants to process refugees directly from turkey then germany can do that , but it will never be pan european . 
  sure , merkel might not * want * more refugees in germany , but her policies insure that they would keep coming . 
  it 's like a parent who wants their kids to lose weight , but every time the kid starts crying they break down and give them sweets because they ca n't stand up to a child 's whining . 
  opinion polls clearly indicate the majority of germans want fewer refugees . 
  this is not the only issue so it does not translate into equal afd support , but that does n't mean anyone who did not vote afd supports the current refugee policy . 
  i thought i accidentally scrolled up . 
  you guys are having exactly the same discussion twice . 
  nokia should have gone for android as soon as it came out . 
  east german states have unemployment rates higher than 8 % , and even higher for youth and lower skill people . 
  in other words , the must vulnerable in society will be the ones competing with refugees for a shrinking number of low skill jobs . 
  i also doubt east germans suffer for the reason you mentioned , all of eastern europe rejected the current immigration wave yet has higher economic growth than the new bundeslander . 
  actually if it were simply xenophobia they probably would n't care . 
  rather they realize that as more and more settle in west germany east germans will be squeezed even more in jobs , funding and doctors . 
  or people in east germany suffer from higher unemployment and lower income and therefore do not see it as a positive that germany is bringing in hundreds of thousands that will compete for lower skill jobs that are in short supply , healthcare ( where there are already not enough doctors in the east ) and have been told there is no money and suffer from cuts right and left . 
  what 's really ridiculous is that many germans in the west think so little of east germans . 
  on top of that some of the areas in the west where the afd got its best results are areas with high immigrant populations ... also areas with lower income and higher unemployment . 
  so the commonality is not hate for foreigners or lack of contact with them , but economic concerns . 
  green voters on the other hand have a high average income so will probably benefit from more cheap labor and do n't really care if poor germans get the short end . 
  because local building planners often seem to approve mosques with minarets that often would not otherwise be approved , because ... well at least then they can not be accused of being racists . 
  a flat national ban would stop this . 
   if they want a minaret , it ought to at least follow the local building traditions ( i.e. 
  be in romaseque or baroque or old german style tower ) . 
  exactly , as i said :  if they want a minaret , it ought to at least follow the local building traditions ( i.e. 
  be in romaseque or baroque or old german style tower ) . 
  i just hate seeing things like [ this ] ( http://www.thelocal.dk/galleries/news/denmarks-largest-shia-mosque-opens-in-copenhagen ) that would never ever be allowed if it were not a mosque . 
  my point is that we already have numerous mosques that by their very existence show minarets are being approved where the building code would normally ** not ** allow them , so some national law to bring local building enforcement in line ( and protect them from charges of racism ) is in fact needed . 
  what bs . 
  in almost all european cities any new building is required to meet approval in look so that it is asthetically pleasing . 
  in norway this is very very strict , i have seen people who had to go back and replace a thirty thousand kroner garage door because it was deemed not to be in line with the historical feeling of the town . 
  no one would ever , ever be allowed to build a tower in middle eastern style here , except i am sure as part of a mosque , where europeans seem to be ready to throw out the same rules that apply to everyone else . 
  skyscrapers are only allowed in small areas of germany and even they are required to go through a very strict approval process which considers how they integrate into the asthetic of asthetically city . 
  a minaret would not integrate into any city , especially in the middle eastern style which muslims prefer . 
  if they want a minaret , it ought to at least follow the local building traditions ( i.e. 
  be in romaseque or baroque or old german style tower ) . 
   and wants to form a 20th germany . 
  so today 's germany is the 19th , nazis were 18th , german republic , german empire , prussia ( ? ) . 
  what were the 14 germany 's before that ? 
  i could see the afd going the way of the sweden democrats and dropping the less popular parts of the platform while keeping their opposition to germany 's current sonderweg in refugee policy . 
  if die linke or gr\u00fcnen had any practicality they would pull the rug from the afd and demand a total end to allowing those who arrive by human smugglers/boats to get asylum . 
  it is resulting in thousands of deaths per year that could entirely be avoided by instead putting those billions into camps turkey and a sustainable resettlement program . 
  but german politicians are bent on ceding the field to the new right . 
  many of the drugs which are today very important were first run in trials for the treatment of other symptoms . 
  look at the interpol website . 
  most of the people listed as wanted there never incriminate themselves publically and have never been convicted . 
  bin laden never admitted to involvement in 9/11 publicly , though i agree baghdadi is a bad example . 
  should osama bin ladens name have been kept secret because be was not convicted ? 
  how about baghdadi ? 
  or what about any number of murderers who are on international wanted lists but were never convicted in a court of law ? 
  it sounds like a great argument that those yet to be convicted deserve privacy , but it is obviously not universally true . 
  especially in hindsight that this guy eventually went serve a group which rapes and tortures as a matter of policy it would have been better to make his name and appearance known to the public so some citizen in sweden could have reported him . 
  instead he is now victimizing people in syria . 
  this is what i do n't get , why is this guy not on an interpol list with his name published online ? 
  many people there were not convicted but fleeing a crime scene and then the country forfeits your right to privacy as an accused . 
  yeah . 
  the original story was almost unbelievable . 
  anytime i read about a nuclear accident in the media i simply assume the story is mostly bs . 
  `` radiation leaks '' that are in fact an almost un-measurable quantity of tritium , `` fire at a nuclear reactor '' that is fact a fire in a transformer a quarter of a mile away . 
  i feel that shows a lack of respect for the lives of syrian and iraqi civilians . 
  organized criminal gangs are treated as a collective and tried as such for their crimes in europe . 
  isis is known to engage in murder , hate crimes , extortion , theft and torture as a matter of state policy and has declared war on the uk . 
  anyone joining isis knows this and by extension supports these crimes , if you want to try them as civilians then the collective time they should spend in jail ought to last until death . 
  i am against torture as well . 
  however those involving themselves with enemy militaries must be tried appropriately . 
  allowing isis fighters to return to europe and ever regain freedom is inhumane , it shows that europe has no respect for the victims of isis , the safety of its own citizens and is in fact a de facto endorsement of the torture and executions isis commits . 
  no eu country would ever , ever allow someone who went on a rampage in another eu country to return and enjoy freedom . 
  agreed . 
  they should have been given military tribunals and any citizens of european countries or the us should have been exexuted if found guilty of treason . 
  citizenship gives rights and privileges but entails obligations , among those is the obligation not to give assistance to those who have declared war on the country where you are a citizen . 
  i mean nazi agents that were uk citizens . 
  they were often executed or at least tried for treason , and the uk never protested when they were captured and held without trial by the us . 
  william joyce was executed for example , just as any british citizen that goes to fight for isis , boko haram , the taliban or al qaeda . 
  locking them up indefinitely is a less severe option , in hindsight it was a mistake . 
  they should have been executed quickly after a military tribunal . 
   uk citizens were in guantanamo . 
  it very much was a problem for us . 
  `` uk citizens , '' these people traveled to a foreign country to fight against an ally of the uk or assist those who do . 
  they should be treated exactly as nazi agents were in ww2 . 
  dear mario , this reddit reply hereby informs you of the intent by blockbuster inc. to sue you in the amount of $ 38,476.54 aud . 
  according to the articles of ttip this may be garnished from your wages , so it would be to your advantage to settle this matter now out of court . 
  russians eat staples with fresh bowl of motor oil and a glass of vodka for breakfast . 
  can confirm , i met one once . 
  dealing in construction in norway i can say my totally subjective impression is that a lot more of what i use day to day is made in italy ( saw blades , tools , drill bits , materials ) not much from the uk . 
  i am sure the uk makes many good products it 's just that everything i see is either from italy , germany or asia .
