  nope , that pledge is from june 2017 . 
  these sanctions passed weeks later . 
  http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/29/politics/trump-energy-department-speech/index.html  b. trump opposes these sanctions . 
  then why did trump not grant exxon the waiver for drilling in the arctic ? 
  it would have been very easy to justify , since now our state oil company statoil , is drilling where exxon would have . 
   its funny how people try and make this out to be about us gas interests that is what it 's about . 
   only this week , brussels fired a shot across america 's bows to warn that it would retaliate if washington 's latest round of sanctions against russia impacted european companies and energy projects . 
  juncker insisted he was ready to hit back within days . 
  `` america first can not mean that europe 's interests come last , '' he stressed . 
  the trade war is coming , trump is trying to push us towards more expensive us gas with these sanctions against russia . 
  europe can not let trump determine who are trading partners are . 
  look at the youtube comments , this stuff only encourages the crazies . 
  actually trump is showing his true colors , his republican allies in the congress and the senate passed this , he holds the majority in both houses . 
  this is a transparent attempt to promote more expensive us gas at the expense of germany , and furthermore hurt german , french and italian exports to russia . 
  as said before , the us may expect wto complaints if you want to interfere in european energy decisions . 
  the suggestion , even in comedy , that there is something `` special '' about `` aryans '' is offensive enough . 
  by even addressing this in comedy funk is reinforcing the idea of a german race or european ethnicity , it feeds those who want to close borders and reinforces their paranoid delusions . 
  actually it 's even worse , the nsu was likely controlled by the verfassungsschutz , meaning the far right has agents within the government . 
  look at polands birth rate , refugees are not `` poison '' they would be a huge net benefit to the polish economy . 
  people still can not be returned to a country in a civil war . 
   it 's a shame that trump and germany are against them . 
  i used to think this , but i doubt it now . 
  these play directly into trump 's agenda . 
  a few years ago the us announced you wanted to sell natural gas to us . 
  [ trump openly announced that this is his goal ] ( http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/energy-environment/339712-natural-gas-exports-centerpiece-of-trumps-energy-plan_ ) . 
  and the profits from that will go right to large trump donors and states that voted for him . 
  congress did n't pass this to `` defy '' trump but because it will [ mean tens of billions of dollars to their donors ] ( https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30052 ) and 50 % more expensive gas for german industry . 
  [ trump already extended sanctions and prevented exxon from doing business in russia . ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/04/21/trump-administration-says-it-wont-grant-any-exception-to-russia-sanctions-not-even-to-exxonmobil/?utm_term=.ada1377c2eac ) . 
  if trump was going to roll back sanctions or the like , he would have done it for exxon - it would have been pretty defensible since that really just hurt exxon and not russia . 
  now our state oil company , [ statoil , is drilling where exxon would have ] ( https://www.rosneft.com/press/news/item/185549/ ) . 
  trump being `` against '' greater sanctions is a great selling point but frankly no one cares here about that and few believe it . 
  germany , france , italy and more are against them since they will hurt our economies . 
  its easy for the us to be for sanctions that will benefit them . 
  funny for you to say that when northern europe is filled with italians that came for economic reasons . 
  `` oh you mean we ca n't tow refugees to a country currently in a civil war ? '', 
  it is not rescuing if they are dropped off in an unsafe country . 
  what they were planning to do is illegal and we never going to be allowed . 
  diesel actually has some of the lowest emissions per mile , yet the us and now the uk is focused on banning them . 
  a pretty transparent swipe at germany which has a significant advantage in diesel technology . 
  [ when u cry everytime ] ( https://img.youtube.com/vi/bwzyyaxkqqc/0.jpg ), 
  as / u/4000calories said , both sides are . 
  trump is pushing for new sanctions against iran , cuba , [ venezuela ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/18/world/americas/trump-administration-sanctions-venezuela.html ) and now russia . 
  it fits into a pattern of division . 
   deport all racists . 
  europe will no longer be the monolithic societies they once were , whether you like it or not migration is desirable and inevitable . 
  europe having once been monolithic societies is a right wing myth anyway . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorbian_languages https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipka_tatars, 
  well said , such programs are only beginning to be discussed in germany . 
  furthermore a lot of these immigrants have started taking laungage classes and even found jobs , deporting them is more along the lines of a trump agenda than anything that accords to eu ideals . 
  great . 
  hopefully no one else attempts this , there are so many laws that they can be found to be violating . 
  trump voting states and his oil buddies will profit massively if the eu ends up needing to import more us gas . 
  help rescuing people , returning people to an unsafe country is a violation of ehrc rulings . 
  they are more efficient , it 's just that the eu has a significant lead in diesel engines so the us tries to ban them . 
  it 's just american protectionism . 
   and i still say that you are a monumental fool if you think that three disparate actors like russia , congress , and trump actually put an elaborate show on just to pass some sanctions . 
  now you are just trolling . 
  russia does not desire these sanctions to be passed , obviously . 
  i did n't say that russia attacked ukraine to make these sanctions be passed . 
  rather that those events provide a good pretext to pass what is really a protectionist measure which would make us more dependent on us gas . 
  that was explicitly what trump promised - `` us energy supremacy . '', 
   you apparently know nothing about how lng works . 
  it does not come out of the ground ready for export-it takes considerable time and investment to transport it to a export center for liquefication , liquefy and store it , and then ship it somewhere prepared to gasify it and then transport it . 
  i know that very well , hence its higher cost . 
  anyway , if these sanctions are passed , you may enjoy complaints at the wto . 
  it 's really sad you get a torrent of down votes for supporting basic human decency and eu law . 
  this sub has had a huge influx of people from t_d ( notice the number of new accounts posting in this thread ) . 
  there 's no proof that gmo crops help with hunger . 
  the best point to stop the spread of gmo crops is before they become entrenched in the agriculture and its vital that europe stop this from happening in africa . 
  anonymous sources . 
  at the time i believed these stories , but then all the substantive actions have been more aggressive towards russia . 
  the funny thing is that when obama came in he actually lifted sanctions and then reset relations , as if the problem in russian relations was bush , despite the fact that russia was still occupying georgian land and expanding that occupation by the day . 
  that 's funny , you ignore the fact that trump openly stated the outcome of these sanctions is his desire : american energy supremacy . 
  come on , do n't be pedantic . 
  the next best option is us lng if russian gas is no longer an option . 
  the sanctions are _ america first _ in the sense of `` sell american products first . '', 
  a few years ago the us announced you wanted to sell natural gas to us , now you are figuring out how to force us to buy it . 
  [ trump openly announced that this is his goal ] ( http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/energy-environment/339712-natural-gas-exports-centerpiece-of-trumps-energy-plan_ ) . 
  and the profits from that will go right to large trump donors and states that voted for him . 
  congress did n't pass this to `` defy '' trump but because it will [ mean tens of billions of dollars to their donors ] ( https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30052 ) and 50 % more expensive gas for german industry . 
  congress `` tying trumps hands '' is just a good cop/bad cop thing . 
  there 's pipelines all over the us , especially running south to texas , which is where the lng ports are being built . 
  no one said it would be shipped via pipeline to europe . 
  it 's not really clear trump is against the sanctions . 
  he renewed the ban on exxon doing business in russia . 
  the only clear thing is trump is erratic , and these sanctions will benefit his donors . 
  yeah , and the mean police agent is `` considering '' beating you up but luckily if you confess the nice one will protect you . 
  [ in reality though trump renewed the sanctions on exxon ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/business/energy-environment/treasury-exxon-mobil-sanctions-waiver.html ) . 
  he 's deploying missile defense and increasing troop levels here , but wait , we have to watch out and really hurt european business , otherwise you guys wo n't be able to control trump , you do n't know what he 'll do !!, 
  a few years ago the us announced you wanted to sell natural gas to us , now you are figuring out how to force us to buy it . 
  [ trump openly announced that this is his goal ] ( http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/energy-environment/339712-natural-gas-exports-centerpiece-of-trumps-energy-plan_ ) .

  how about instead of sanctions that hurt europe and benefit us , you work on an alternative solution ? 
   hump change right ? 
  if you honestly want to believe this was a conspiracy weaved by states with gas interests that managed to unite the us congress in a way i have n't seen since 9/11 , well you lose the right to claim an american it 's not a conspiracy , the us did n't make russia attack ukraine , it 's just trump taking advantage in the situation . 
  that article is an advertisement for sanctions really , aimed at americans . 
  it also ignores that way before this trump threw away pursuing better relations with russia , [ denying exxon doing business there ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/business/energy-environment/treasury-exxon-mobil-sanctions-waiver.html ) or striking syria . 
  i mean really , let me understand , to get a multi-billion dollar flow of money to states that voted for him , all trump has to do is cast doubt on intelligence findings ? 
  this really is like a bad romance novel where the pirate takes the maiden against her will .
