bergen in norway ( 54,6 ) is larger than valencia in spain ( 54,2 ) . 
  both bota\u015e ( 61,2 ) and \u0130zmit ( 60,6 ) in turkey are larger than immingham ( 60,1 ) in uk .

  about the jewish thing ... 
  i ca n't recall ever seeing anyone wearing `` something jewish '' ( if its the hats and hair things you mean ) . 
  but i do n't think that would be a problem as long as you avoid the most remote and smallest villages . 
  and even the people in those villages , despite being xenophobic and racist as fuck , will probably leave you alone . 
  nrk isnt that bad , but they lean a bit to the left . 
  as someone whos had to deal with barnevernet as a kid . 
  they deserve every single piece of shit thats thrown their way . 
  the majority of the people i met during our `` investigation '' were powerhungry sadists that threatened and lied to us . 
  i hope so , but i would n't count on it . 
  a depressingly large portion of norwegians seem to think we can just ban something and the problem will be gone . 
  if allowing female genital mutilation would save more girls and cause less harm , then yes i would allow it . 
  but i dont think its common enough for it to make any difference . 
  honor killings is done with the intent to kill . 
  so legalising it will not cause less harm done to the victim . 
  i love the idea of not having it done at all . 
  but i do n't think driving it underground and losing all control over it is the right way to do that . 
  circumcision wont stop unless people stop thinking it will please their god , something i do n't see happening any time soon . 
  circimcision , if done right , does n't hurt the child nowhere near as much as it can if its done wrong . 
  the only thing we can really do is inform the parents on the dangers and harm they inflict on their child and hopefully change their minds , while making sure as little as possible harm is actually done . 
  its extremely bad . 
  i have no respect for parents that wants to do it to their child . 
  but there are some pretty fucked up people out there that will do it even if they have to do it themselves with kitchen knives . 
  i feel this will lead to people circumcising kids for money without the proper training , tools and enviorment . 
  i 'd rather have it done safely by professionals than some shady guy ... 
  i think its putin . 
  the law is already in place . 
  its illegal to pay for sex , but it is not illegal to sell . 
  and it is not 75 % in favour . 
  ~ 23 % want to repeal it , ~ 61 % want to keep it and ~ 16 % are indifferent . 
  [ here are the numbers divided by sex . 
  blue = repeal , red = keep it , grey = indifferent . 
  menn = men and kvinner = women . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/x40kehy.jpg ) it is worth mentioning that the current government has said they wanted to repeal it , but leaders in h\u00f8yre ( largest party in the current coalition ) wants to reconsider it . 
  also , only 1002 were asked , so i can not say how accurate it is . 
  not an expert but basically its there to save money for harder times and not fucking up the norwegian economy too much .

  i 'm not so sure bergen ( which is ranked 2nd ) should be that high . 
  iirc a while ago bergens tidende , which is the largest newspaper in bergen , put a link to the vote on their website . 
  it is still a very beautiful city though . 
  prettiest in norway imo . 
  how to * write * `` i '' in various european languages . 
  idk about the other countries , but in norway we got atleast 5 different ways of saying it . 
  proper roads . 
  should have sent en godt stekt pizza, 
  i think this is just sad . 
  there are serious problems with the norwegian cps , but the valid criticism is not taken seriously partly because of stupid shit like this . 
  it is unnecessary . 
  i 'm 100 % sure nordics would be capable of shopping their boose in normal stores . 
  i also think they might be able to survive being able to buy liqour past 6pm on weekdays . 
  hell they might even survive buying on a sunday !, 
  vinmonopolet ( ca n't speak for systembolaget because i 've never been in one ) is a decent store . 
  they got a good ordering service , great staff with good knowledge of wines . 
  but they got horrible closing hours and the prices are way too high . 
  what makes norway interesting . 
  i 'm interested because i find our history , food and politics all pretty boring . 
   on the other hand , we got money to build fountains in almost every village , they are very nice . 
  so thats why theres so many fountains in eurovision . 
  someone tell graham norton . 
  growing up on the mean streets of helsinki , life isnt easy . 
  what do you call yourselves ? 
  you 're already called czechia ( `` tsjekkia '' ) in my language . 
   drop the `` is okay '' nonsense i wont . 
  i do n't think the use of unlawful kidnappings , holding people without trial and torture is justified ever . 
  i believe everyone has a right to a fair trial and that everyone has basic human rights . 
  if you do n't think thats a legitimate position then i wo n't bother commenting here anymore . 
  okay . 
  then can you explain in what history and context guantanamo bay is okay ? 
   it 's really not fair and leaves some travelers jaded . 
  those travelers are right to be jaded , angry even . 
  i do n't blame anyone for their country 's problems and nobody should . 
  people suck : /, 
  but you do see how someone with little insight in your country 's history might feel that torturing people with no trial is a bit bad right ? 
  i mean , say a previously unknown state suddenly overthrows the british government and installs a dictator . 
  you would probably not feel too good about that state , even if you know little about it . 
  you can atleast agree that it makes sense for someone as ignorant as i am to feel discomfort with some of the things i mentioned above , no ? 
  then could you please try to make me understand what makes the things okay ? 
  i do n't know ... 
  i dislike the us foreign policy because of all the overthrowing democraticly elected governments and installing dictators . 
  guantanamo bay also plays a large role . 
  entering iraq on false background . 
  `` war on terror '' . 
  oh forget it . 
  its obviously just because i do n't understand you . 
  they have their own language , flag and culture . 
  they also have their own sami parliments in norway , sweden and finland . 
  the sami parliment gives extra advice to the real parliment on issues that concerns the sami . 
  but i didnt think they really wanted to have their own country . 
  i thought they just wanted to keep their own indentity . 
  imo , its ridiculous if they really want to claim all that land . 
  its estimated there are only 58 000 sami , 40 000 of which lives in norway . 
  they are n't the majority ethnic group except for a few towns like kaotokeino and karasjok . 
  its like a unicorn . 
  a bit of both imo . 
  our two largest political parties ( ap and h\u00f8yre ) are n't pro immigration . 
  one of which ( h\u00f8yre ) is in government with a smaller , anti-immigration party ( frp ) . 
  however , the current government needs support by two pro-immigration parties ( venstre and krf ) to stay in power . 
  people in general want to take in `` our share '' of refugees , but not go full sweden .
