  imagine drinking a cold beer in your back yard after a hard day at work , while watching the sun * quietly * set in the horizon . 
  edit : i 've never been there btw . 
  javascript and php :'( working on my python on codeacademy but i do n't enjoy learning it . 
  can read java too , but do n't count that . 
  native norwegian and english . 
  speak swedish and read danish . 
  speak danish and read swedish with some concentration and planning . 
  3 years with spanish in middle school did n't really work out . 
  waaay too complicated for me . 
  three years ago and i still do n't understand how i passed . 
  we took the chance of you guys electing gentlemen . 
  this is old news ... 
  wait what ? ... 
  [ clicks link ] ooooh :d, 
  the pronunciation is very similar to norwegian . 
  i could guess a lot of these sentences just by listening . 
  because they took it ? 
  bring help , please !, 
  we 're sorry , europe !, 
   and just an empty space would look ... odd . 
  i think they have a empty space in turkey , if i remember correctly . 
  wow ^ wow ^ wow de er fine , men ikke s\u00e5 fine . 
  ah thats right . 
  we can say both tjueen ( bokm\u00e5l ) and en-og-tjue ( riksm\u00e5l ) here , but that continues above 50 as well . 
  as long as i do n't have to understand any numbers above 20 ( ?

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_historical_anniversaries now the hard ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ hard ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ ^ least part ; filter out non-european related events . 
  found any gold yet , iceland ? 
  a bit harder to explain that one , but sure , why not . 
  buy our fish , mark it as icelandic and sell it to russia . 
  what about underwood ? 
  oslo people are strange ... something you 'll understand quite fast . 
  `` ehhh ... 
  i guess i 'm standing the next kilometers '', 
  drink . 
  at least that 's what we do . 
  \\ + gold becomes `` g\u00e5ld '' and non-translated * swedish words ( e.g : silver ) stay `` swedish '' ^ ^ ^ ^ * ^ ^ ^ ^ some ^ ^ ^ ^ english ^ ^ ^ ^ words ^ ^ ^ ^ might ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ swedish ^ ^ ^ ^ origin . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ idk , ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ ^ swedish ^ ^ ^ ^ expert ^ ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ ^ anything . 
  the norwegian one is ok , but i kinda like the russian one . 
  you can tell it 's made to make the people proud of their country . 
  ok song , great commercial !, 
  imagine when petter northug is on top of the podium at the olympics and they 're playing this song in the background . 
  we 're cooler than everyone else . 
  just visiting a [ bigger ] ( http://i.imgur.com/znfvqra.jpg ) city will get you close to more than just a few, 
  a lot of electric taxis in trondheim , due to the toll .

  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 ? 
  [ was hotter yesterday ] ( http://www.yr.no/place/norway/nord-tr%c3%b8ndelag/stj%c3%b8rdal/hell/ ) about 35c i believe . 
  [ hysj ] ( https://www.akademssr.se/getimage/jpeg/120321_8130632604f69e95a817ff.jpg ), 
  a lot of scandinavian words could be included , but yeah i agree, 
  no problem , i read swedish .

  english dialect : 1 . 
  english ( england ) 2 .

  may 17 . without a royal family would n't be the same , even though i 've never been in oslo celebrating it . 
  [ ^ yeah ] ( http://youtu.be/49ckgeqvh70?t=34s ) , 
  * norway has no need for you , as long as it 's peaceful in europe * - around christmas 2012, 
  because you owe us enough as it is, 
  [ we give away enough ] ( http://ap.mnocdn.no/incoming/article7513754.ece/alternates/w980c169/bistandspolitikk.jpg?updated=240320141232 ) !, 
  hold kjeft !, 
  wow , that text was more understandable than i thought !, 
  the grayer the better , 
  wonder if there is some kind of potato union between latvia and denmark , 
  the key is , you need to walk around with something in your mouth all the time . 
  when you get used to your own voice , * tillykke !, 
  * you now speak danish fluently !, 
  at least that 's what my grandpa always told me when i was younger . 
  works a lot better if you speak norwegian probably , but it 's worth a try !, 
  and you forgot the l :(, 
  this . 
  ( - dutch , wtf ), 
  go outside in a few days and shout as loud as you can : `` free drinks ! '', 
  the russ will sure find its way . 
  depends . 
  * when i try to sound smart : english * shouting : german * making food : italian * eating the food : danish * playing foolish : swedish different languages for different activities , i guess . 
  i bet scandinavia will start using english officially soon ( in a few generations ) . 
  we use more and more english words instead of our native words . 
  i will teach my future children both english and norwegian . 
  nah , kvinneguiden is the shit . 
  that would be familieprat.no, 
  kvinneguiden.no . 
  a norwegian forum created to help females with female problems , but pretty much has the answer to anything at this point . 
  on top of almost any google search in norwegian . 
  as always , 
  we 've got a lot more than you think , but thats beside the point . 
  yeah , i know . 
  same thing in trondheim as well .
