  prostitution is [ allowed ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_norway ) , but the client commits a crime by purchasing sex ...

  went to latvia in 9th grade , me and my buddies bought candy on a saturday evening for and everyone in the store looked at us strangely ( four 15 year-olds buying a cart full of candy is n't common , i guess ) . 
  idk how much we paid , but we had candy for days ( we bought candy by counting the price , but by kg ) ... 
  the cashier checked each bill , he probably thought we were scamming him . 
  [ docm77 did a vlog about it . ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6grqddedmu ) ^ ( in english ofc . ), 
  googlet `` moomin swedish '' . 
  whenever i 'm in j\u00e4mtland , the people understand me better when i speak my own dialect ( fintr\u00f8ndersk ) . 
  once i leave j\u00e4mtland , i have to use * standard norwegian * to be understood . 
  i still have to use some swedish words . 
  sk\u00e5ne is no problem , we 're used to commercials with [ tina nordstr\u00f6m ] ( https://youtu.be/z3gf3kgxyh4 ) anyway . 
  ( not hardcore sk\u00e5ne dialect , but still ), 
  swedish and danish fairly easy , finnish and russian on the other hand ... 
  [ sk\u00e5l !, 
  when people try to be funny like that , i read it out in norwegian ^ ( or danish ) / swedish to make the writer seem like an idiot .
