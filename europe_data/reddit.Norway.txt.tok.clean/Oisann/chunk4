  only , we know how to sort them correctly . 
  i take it , this is the same as kebab-norsk . 
  haha . 
  dat accent tho . 
  i ca n't stand british english , so i guess i 'll have to go with swedish or french . 
  i do n't speak french , * men svenska \u00e4r inte s\u00e5 sv\u00e5rt * . 
  hint has a big thing for icelandic people or something . 
  i 'm not . 
  in my classes alone , i think we have close to 12-15 icelandic people . 
  keep in mind that this is n't a big school at all . 
  we 're 45-50 in total in my classes . 
  alternatively , you can visit steinkjer , norway . 
  they jokingly said , when i moved here a week ago , that there will be more icelandic people here than in iceland by 2050 . 
  [ get rekt s\u00f8n ] ( https://youtu.be/v6qngo0nmt4 ), 
  malm\u00f6 and k\u00f8benhavn , wtf are you guys doing down there ? 
  haha , i know one of the creators of this . 
  that 's cancelled out by the fact that you 're sweden . 
  i hate that about alienblue ( the only app i 've used ) as well . 
  danish is the one that looks weird . 
  we got that too , you know . 
  lager than life !, 
  we can pay to skip the line though . 
  the us , sweden and denmark . 
  norway 2 . 
  sweden ( vacation probably 5-6 times and a few times to shop ) 3 . 
  denmark ( vacation 3-4 times ) 4 . 
  latvia ( school trip ) 5 . 
  germany ( drove through on a trip to tour de france ) 6 . 
  switzerland ( same as above ) 7 . 
  france ( montpellier watching the tour ) 8 . 
  spain ( vacation 2 times ) 9 . 
  italy ( quick trip from montpellier ) next on my list is probably the nederlands or london . 
  the us is probably on top of my list of places i want to visit and iceland is up there as well . 
  sweden is the joke , not the prize !, 
  never been to \u00c5lesund , but it 's pretty close ^ ^ * to where i live so i can imagine it being pretty nice  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ * ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ live ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ trondheim, 
  stockho ... i mean uhm , i do n't have a favorite . 
  [ production value pls ] ( https://youtu.be/5nygi0cof6e ), 
  ... a little more than the rest of the week *, 
  just in case anyone was wondering . 
  this is one i can agree with !, 
  if you need help , i 'm sure we can send you some pocket money . 
  couple billions or so . 
  ( my swedish is not flawless , please do n't kill me ), 
  it 's a cheap alternative owned by coop ( a major retail chain in scandinavia ) . 
  i bet you could find the exact same product , made by someone else for just a few kroner/kronor more and with a much higher production value ( or whatever you want to call it ) . 
  [ watch this if you understand swedish ^ ^ * . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/lc7twgwwj10 ) it makes fun of the strange way things like shampoo and * a lot * of other things that are labeled in scandinavia . 
  an example using american and british would be something like this : `` this product contains food colouring/coloring '' ( i know it 's bad , but you get the point . ), 
  however it 's mostly used with words that is pronounced differently or spelled entirely different . 
  anyone need oil ? 
  give us a call . 
  i wish all of you could see tv2 norway 's coverage of the tour , you learn * a lot * !, 
  not only about cycling , but every single place the cycle through . 
  their fantasy * tourmanager * game is pretty cool as well . 
  edit : i 've only seen danish tv2 and eurosport in both norwegian and english , they were boring . 
  hardly said anything . 
  most of them live in europe , do n't they ? 
  that 's what i 've always thought . 
  just use adopt bokm\u00e5l , easy solution . 
  we keep it somewhat up-to-date , even though * nobody * cares . 
  % u0161 is \u0161 . 
  % 20 is a space . 
  according to google translate it 's bosnian and it says `` that is quite a premier retarded . '', 
  have n't spurt him om it desverre . 
  jeg bet det will bli just as morsomt as i fjor . 
  ^ what he/she said . 
  it 's veldig annoying \u00e5 read etterp\u00e5 . 
  the * room with a mini kitchen * ( with my own bathroom ) , 12m ^ 2 , i rent while i go to school costs 5700nok ( $ 649 ) a month . 
  that includes heating , water , power and internet ... trondheim , norway . 
  1 sweden 4 norwegian 12 english 13 danish 14 german everything else sounds dutch , haha . 
  whenever i am in sweden and talk norwegian , you understand 50 % of it ... no worries though , my swedish is not * that * bad , since basically every non-english tv series is in swedish . 
  nah they copied us , as usual , 
  / r/justnorwayproblems, 
  cyka blyat * something something *, 
  it 's just * sm\u00e5penger * though ... , 
  uhm , either you 've missed out on real milk or you 're crazy . 
  haha :d, 
  milk stored in room temperature in france . 
  a true wtf moment for my * milk for breakfast * requiring heart . 
  i left the next day ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ jk, 
  we ~ ~ usually ~ ~ * often * use the name the native people call it . 
  another example is greece , we call it * hellas * . 
  * en godt stekt pizza * should have been our contribution , haha . 
  bj\u00f6rkar is plural for bj\u00f6rk in swedish , as far as i know . 
  how is the speed in populated areas ? 
  i feel like we have a thing here where it 's better to have 40 , 80 , 150 or even 300 mbps speed but only 1-10gb of data a month . 
  i do n't see why anyone would need a internet connection faster than 15-20mbps on their phone . 
  and if someone does ( i know people do n't always have broadband options that compete with mobile speeds ) , just let them pay a little more ... 
  i think * most * providers in norway have the american `` unlimited '' , where they throttle your speed after you hit your monthly cap . 
  but if you just limit everyone 's speed to ~ 15mbps , you would have plenty of room for the real unlimited . 
  edit : about a year and a half ago , i was fortunate to get a `` unlimited data for 12 months '' contract , the 13th month was a pain . 
  going from a ~ 110gb/month to 6gb/month was hard , haha . 
  mutual friends . 
  he probably knows though . 
  hahaha , i know this guy !, 
  hahaha , why have i never seen this ? 
  they will probably change it on sunday . 
  easy, 
  barely passed high school spanish , i can feel your pain all the way over here . 
  to be honest , i do n't know why i passed .
