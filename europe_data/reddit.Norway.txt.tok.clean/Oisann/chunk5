  add this one too : [ size does matter ] ( https://youtu.be/f488ujaqgmw ), 
  forever a goal , huh ? 
  just to give a simple example , there were a lot of people that simply * loved animals * , so they acted just like all the anti-vaxxers and crazy feminists do when they get some tv time . 
  i 'm sorry if it 's a unclear example , but hopefully you understand what i mean . 
  i was hoping for a different outcome , but only because i hate the big percentage of people that clearly had no idea about what they were talking about . 
  : / i really do n't care though . 
  imagine our king being more like carl gustaf . 
  super-fast and cheap fiber and i 'll consider it . 
  10gbit/s for $ 100 or something :p, 
  i 'm sorry , but i find this kind of funny . 
  is that bad ? 
  no , i do n't talk to strangers . 
  cheap diapers makes it worth it . 
  allu is so awesome that he can do whatever he wants !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ he ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ smart ^ ^ ^ ^ enough ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ stay ^ ^ ^ ^ away ^ ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ ^ swedish . 
  i hardly drink tap water outside the nordics . 
  i drank it in germany and switzerland , but not in france and spain . 
  i do n't remember what i did when i was in latvia , but i think i drank it . 
  i ca n't stand the dubbing , but everything else is really cool and well done . 
  thumbs up !, 
  a youtuber called tom scott just made a video about this . 
  you should check him out . 
  you 're watching tom are n't you ? 
  you do n't have that problem ? 
  if not , i 'll take a trip to finland i think . 
  i do n't know exactly how bad it is in sweden , but damn , i am so tired of people being offended all the time . 
  i 'm with [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/fhmodt3nshs ) guy . 
  / r/loleu is coming for you !, 
  it 's still 100 % waste of money , in my opinion . 
  but hey , i do n't smoke . 
  in norway we try to open shops on sundays , but so many people are against it . 
  to be honest , i do n't understand why someone would be against that . 
  i pay 5700nok ( $ 662 ) for a 12m ^ 2 in central trondheim , norway . 
  free 50/15 shared wifi and free electricity . 
  a small kitchen and a small bathroom with a shower . 
  small and expensive but good enough for me ... 
  [ newly generated chunks after a biomes update * ] ( https://i.imgur.com/qkqte.jpg ), 
  that explains why swedes understand me more often when i speak with a dialect and not `` bokm\u00e5l-ish '' . 
  it comes naturally to every norwegian . 
  i do n't know how it is for anyone else , 
  / r/justnorwayproblems, 
  very sad :'(, 
  telenor norway removed roaming in eu/eea earlier this week . 
  my scandinavian/baltic roaming from telia norway was expanded to eu/eea this morning . 
  i 've tried it . 
  it 's an odd experience , but it 's better than cycling up the hill yourself . 
  i would recommend [ lido ] ( http://www.lido.lv/eng ) , if you 're in riga . 
  well , it 's not like the websites and videos get any bigger . 
  but yeah , i see what you mean . 
  it 's kind of ridiculous . 
  they are bringing it to norway soon as well . 
  netcom/telia set the world record on an existing network not too long ago . 
  1.2 gbps or something crazy . 
  they have been rolling out 4g + alot lately as well ( ~ 300mbps ) . 
  4.5 g will be pretty awsome !, 
  i mean , we read some sagas but not much more than that . 
  no i do n't . 
  i can understand * some * written simple sentences , sort of . 
  it could be easier as a norwegian speaker , but i do n't really know . 
  i do n't feel like it 's worth learning tbh . 
  most people in both norway and iceland speak english . 
  they also learn some danish , enough for us to communicate * ok * without english . 
  the only reason i have to learn it would be to brag about it . 
  i study with a lot of icelandic people and i like their language more and more every day . 
  it 's pretty cool !, 
  sure , whatever you say . 
  i really do n't care what you mean . 
  i 'm pretty sure i know more than you do here . 
  i have a few barnevernet friends and i 've heard a lot of stories , but it 's always for a reason . 
  even if the kid/parents do n't understand why . 
  that 's what happenes when you do n't take care of your children by following our rules . 
  it 's simple really . 
  but it 's fun :(, 
  london is ez . 
  sorry i 'm drunk , i meant to say thanks !, 
  the rest of them are in norway . 
  i have 15 icelanders ( or something ) in my game design class . 
  we 're like 40 in total . 
  haha , cool :d, 
  * vrede * means * wrath * up here : o when i say it out loud , i can hear that it could mean peace in some germanic language, 
  i think i know swedish words until i start thinking about them :p, 
  norwegian/swedish/danish : fred ^ ( pretty sure it 's the same in all of them ), 
  mostly in and around bigger cities , but it 's not uncommon elsewhere either . 
  or norwegian . 
  afrika , africa . 
  as a great a student once said ; c , fuck off mate . 
  fuck you too !, 
  come and join the / r/loleu club !, 
  yeah , that would be an obvious fix to that problem . 
  i have no idea , to be honest . 
  i guess it has something to do with tradition . 
  i did n't really follow the last time it was in the media , but i think i recall someone arguing it had something to do about more work ( needing a day of the week away from work ) . 
  it 's pretty stupid no matter what the reason is . 
  it 's fucking annoying , because i always end up needing something on sundays ... 
  omg that sf intro !, 
  anyway , when i was a kid , my dad had pirated the cards for our satellite . 
  when i was about 6 or 7 they made that stuff impossible . 
  so for a while we only had viasat tv3 ( and some other channels ) in danish and swedish . 
  it helped me alot when it comes to understanding you guys now . 
  even though most norwegians can have a hard time understanding danish , i really do n't .
