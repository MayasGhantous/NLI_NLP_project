what the hell are you on ? 
  you 'll be exotic in norway, 
  the main difference is that frp is libertarian , the gop is conservative . 
  i guess they 're pretty similar on fiscal issues , but frp would never , say promote teaching of creationism in public schools or oppose gay marriage . 
  below -20 is not rare . 
  it 's pretty warm at the moment , but temperatures reached that level earlier this winter, 
  damn , we look pretty well off considering our long coast, 
  the first muslim women in the olympics first took part in berlin ' 36 . 
  i do n't know if that proves anything , but i do n't think the nazis hated muslims as much as jews and eastern europeans . 
  depends what `` more people '' you want to see . 
  if it 's family , that 's already the case for me , so i guess i would n't mind too much . 
  i live in a municipality with 50,000 inhabitants , it 's really quite nice . 
  that 's really sad, 
  why not ? 
  it 's not like it 's 300,000 people spread over a huge area , most of the population lives in reykjavik, 
  crazy swedes, 
  iceland , easily . 
  they do n't have the same problems with immigration , they are excelling economically while we are slowing down . 
  their culture is also really interesting , they 're like a 1,000 year old time capsule for us . 
  how prevalent is support for succession in basque country ? 
  and how many speak basque ? 
  as i 'm sure you 're aware , keeping your language is important for your national identity . 
  hollande refuses to drop the wine -- dinner with rouhani is off & nbsp ; while italian officials made sure naked statues were covered up when the iranian president hassan rouhani visited , fran\u00e7ois hollande refused to drop the wine when rouhani arrives in paris today . 
  & nbsp ; during the preparations for hassan rouhani 's official visit in france , which starts this afternoon , the menu has made for diplomatic problems . 
  & nbsp ; ** that 's because rouhani refuses to be present at events where alcohol is served . 
  ** & nbsp ; according to the french tv-station rtl , rouhani asked if they were going to serve alcohol during the planned dinner with fran\u00e7ois hollande . 
  & nbsp ; ** that was the last drop for france . 
  the wish for dropping the french red wine , was rejected . 
  ** & nbsp ; according to rtl , the staff at the elys\u00e9e palace showed to france 's republican traditions for dinners in the presidential palace . 
  `` it was a prepared dinner , but the plans failed , '' says a source to the station , who thinks the leaders are letting a good possibility for useful conversations slip . 
  & nbsp ; in an attempt to find a compromise when the official dinner seemed impossible to make happen , france suggested breakfast instead . 
  that was apparently `` too simple '' for iran , reports the local . 
  & nbsp ; ** the two presidents must now meet after eating separately . 
  i know it 's illegal , but they should be allowed to do it . 
  `` i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it '' - voltaire , a long time ago ( although he probably never said it ), 
  what exactly are you trying to prove ? 
  that people are idiots ? 
  how exactly am i sounding like them ? 
  the protest was n't violent . 
  it 's not like my defense of the protest is unreasonable . 
  as long as they do n't physically hurt anyone , trespass or threaten anyone , the protests should be allowed and no cars should be set on fire . 
  hell , if they want to have a parade praising hitler , they should be allowed to . 
  why are you 1 ) assuming that the pegida demonstrators are nazis and 2 ) that those 800 cases are in any way linked with the pegida demonstration ( s ) that took place ? 
  i 'll be happy to talk about right wing extremism , you just ca n't confuse it with being anti-immigration . 
  please do n't compare me with those morons . 
  drunk and annoying does not necessarily mean they are n't peaceful . 
  i 'd much rather have a bunch of loud , drunk men walking outside my house than cars being set on fire . 
  well is n't that democratic ? 
  being violent towards peaceful people because they do n't agree on certain issues . 
  wonderful .

  i 'm now sad that we were n't part of it . 
  i love the `` united europe '' aspect of eurovision . 
  i feel like this was a eurovision without the rubbish music . 
  i 'll admit , i have n't read the whole article . 
  however , i 'd imagine a lot of it is true . 
  maybe some stolen wealth was needed to kick start the industrial revolution , but it was n't really needed after that . 
  most european countries never had colonies , and the reason they are wealthy today is because we 've learned how to utilise our natural resources and climate . 
  why would that not be the case for the countries who had colonies ? 
  i feel that one . 
  oh right , forgot you ca n't ski for shit , 
  i mean , sure !, 
  just ... how cheap is your beer compared to sweden 's ? 
  i believe [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqztp8-8wis&amp;ab_channel=alkie1hibs ) is what you 're looking for .

  i consider myself very patriotic . 
  i think a lot of people do here in norway , just look at our 17th of may parades .
