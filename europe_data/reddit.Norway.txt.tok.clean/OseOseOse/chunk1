out of every 100 people in norway , about how many do you think do not affiliate themselves with any religion -- that is , atheists , agnostics and those who say they do not identify with any religion ? 
   actual answer : 10.1 eh , they really could have worded the question better . 
  ~ 75 % of the population is part of the church of norway according to [ statistics norway ] ( https://www.ssb.no/en/kultur-og-fritid/statistikker/kirke_kostra/aar/2015-05-06 ) , i 'd say that counts as being ** affiliated ** with a religion . 
  oslo and akershus is also green in the first image , in addition to tr\u00f8ndelag . 
  on [ this photographer 's website ] ( http://www.big-photo.no/gpweb/gigapixelindex_spry_oz.html ) there are some really cool gigapixel resolution images from this lookout , and other locations in the region . 
  i dunno about iceland , but in norway we eat [ dried fish snacks ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=t%c3%b8rrfisk+snacks&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=2py&amp;channel=fs&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi85fdy3qpsahxeciwkhr2xapyq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1592&amp;bih=895#imgrc=q6uje3haxttwum: ) . 
   finnish looks like something made up by tolkien for a fairy tale race . 
  well tolkien did take inspiration from finnish , so there is a resemblance by design . 
  i was expecting pandoro and panettone . 
  [ everyone 's favorite eu4 nation ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ulmgonewild/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all ), 
  do you think they will take many voters from hulkip ? 
  i think you accidentally a word there . 
  are there any countries at all that do n't at least * say * they are democratic ( e.g. 
  the democratic people 's republic of korea ) ? 
  i think pretty much every dictator out there organizes `` elections '' to legitimize themself . 
  that 's an interesting observation . 
  depends on what qualifies as `` major '' and `` european '' though . 
  the current leaders of the top four countries by gdp ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) ) are childless , but the next two are not . 
  bergen had a day of sun last week or so . 
  i know , because all the people i know who live there felt the need to send pictures of the occasion . 
  i do n't know whether this guy is an outdoorsman , but people who go skiing in the spring in norway can get very tan . 
  the sun is out for a long time , it 's warm enough to be in t-shirts and shorts , but the snow is still on the ground and acts as a sunlight mirror , so you 'll get a double uv dosage . 
  the land travel network ( i.e. 
  roads and train tracks ) in norway is relatively underdeveloped due to the terrain . 
  going from bergen to stavanger by train is a ridiculous detour ( http://www.projectmapping.co.uk/europe%20world/resources/norway%20strekningskart-540.jpg ) . 
  going by car is possible , but the road is n't a straight line , one lane per direction , and there 's ferries to cross some fjords . 
  because of things like this , norway has a disproportionately large number of domestic flights . 
  `` prince '' is n't always royalty , it can historically also be a generic `` leader '' title . 
  it comes from the latin `` princeps '' , meaning * first * . 
  i 'm eating some of [ these ] ( http://nordic-store.com/bilder/produkte/gross/pingvin-salt-pastiller-daenische-salzpastillen.jpg ) right now . 
  yum yum . 
  i see . 
  silly wikipedians . 
  thanks , but you did n't answer my question :p it 's both in the last column , second row and tenth row , second last column . 
  did you not find it and therefore re-add it ? 
  norway please . 
  also , out of curiosity , is there a reason the norwegian flag appears in two places on the sprite ? 
  in norway * h\u00e6stkuk * ( horsecock ) is ** the ** stereotypical swearword for northerners . 
  used a lot up north , never heard anywhere else . 
  seconded . 
  the tap water at home is better than any fancy bottled water elsewhere . 
  according to a section ( without sources ) on the [ norwegian wikipedia article ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/russefeiring#etymologi_og_bakgrunn ) , it 's from latin * cornua depositurus * . 
  the latin was used in a student initiation ceremony , way back then . 
  our bacalhau bros !, 
  it is also the melody to the royal ( not national ) anthem of norway . 
  there 's an axe too , with a lot of symbolism :  [ approximately in 1280 , either king magnus vi ( dead in 1280 ) or the guardianship of his son eric magnuson let the lion be equipped with a crown of gold and in the foremost paws an axe of silver . 
  the axe was a symbol of saint olaf , i.e. 
  king olaf ii , and by inserting it into the coat of arms it was symbolised that the king was the rightful heir and descendant of the ` eternal king of norway ' ( latin : rex perpetuus norvegiae ) . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_norway ), 
  ditto for norway . 
  it 's storbritannia , or sometimes inaccurately , england . 
  the direct translation for uk ( `` det forente kongeriket '' ) is the not a thing i have ever heard used . 
  the trolls are actually going * into * hibernation soon , since the daylight hours are getting very long . 
  they do n't fare well in direct sunlight . 
  then they 'll come out again around september - october . 
  title case is common to use ( but not universally used ) when your title is a sentence fragment like ` macron elected president ' or ` arsenal defeats manchester united ' . 
  when you type out two full sentences in title case it just looks weird . 
  but the irish and the scots are natural enemies !, 
  just like the the icelandic and the scots . 
  or the norwegian and the scots . 
  i had a hard time picking an image for that comment , these contraptions are all ridiculous in their own unique way .

  there is no official standard of ** spoken ** norwegian . 
  there is `` standard eastern norwegian '' ( standard \u00f8stnorsk ) which is * approximately * what is spoken by a large part of the population around oslo . 
  while it has no official status , it can be used as a de facto `` benchmark '' for those learning norwegian as a second language . 
  there exists a stereotype of arrogant osloites who consider their dialect ( and their form of written norwegian ) to be the only `` correct '' one , but i think most people understand that this is not the case . 
  norwegians : * mostly do n't care about the religious events , but like that there are public holidays . 
  shops and alcohol sales are closed a lot though , which people do n't like . 
  * take our `` spring break '' : school holiday for a full week + 1 day , no university lectures , non-critical jobs take a week of vacation , critical jobs reduce workload to the extent possible . 
  * go skiing in the inland/mountains : winter is ( mostly ) over , but there 's still snow on the ground many places , so ideal conditions for skiing in the sunshine . 
  lots of people own cabins in winter sports locations . 
  tons of [ kvikk lunsj chocolate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvikk_lunsj ) is consumed . 
  * read/watch `` p\u00e5skekrim '' ( easter crime ) novels and tv shows ( mostly british tv , e.g. 
  dunno why this is a thing . 
  * quiz each other . 
  every year you can buy `` p\u00e5skequiz '' ( easter quiz ) quiz books in stores , and there 's special quiz/trivia games on the radio and tv . 
  i also have no idea how this started . 
  * gamers go to [ the second biggest lan party in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_gathering_ ( lan_party \\ ) ) . 
  have a look at the [ norwegian stereotypes map ] ( https://imgur.com/gallery/xmehu#suuwi2z ) by / u/desanti . 
  [ erna i felten ] ( https://ernaifelten.tumblr.com/ ) ( erna in the field ) collects pictures of prime minister erna solberg looking out of place in various situations . 
  bokm\u00e5l started with 1800s danish and evolved from there . 
  some changes were just natural evolution , others were deliberate efforts to norweagianify words ( e.g. 
  the loanword * chaffeur * became * sj\u00e5f\u00f8r * ; same pronounciation but spelled in a more norwegian way ) . 
  nynorsk was `` constructed '' by philogist ivar aasen ( also in the 1800s ) who traveled around the country to study dialects then tried to codify an average/compromise standard . 
  has also undergone significant evolution since then . 
  up until 1966 the official policy of the government was to steer the evolution of both towards each other . 
  this was n't popular ( on either side really ) so it was abandoned . 
  worst is no question : [ vidkun quisling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vidkun_quisling ) became `` leader '' by coup d'etat when the wehrmacht invaded norway in 1940 . 
  because the king and cabinet managed to flee to the uk and continued operating in exile , he is obviously not counted as a legitimate leader of the country . 
  still , he was de facto leader , even if a puppet of hitler . 
  his last name is today used as a synonym of * traitor * . 
  for best there are more options . 
  i think these two are important in different ways : [ king haakon vii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haakon_vii_of_norway ) was the first king of independent norway in 1905 , after the population voted by referendum ( ! ), 
  to remain a monarchy after independence . 
  a `` democratically elected '' monarch in a sense . 
  during wwii he was an important symbol of hope : after the coup d'etat the nazis delivered an ultimatum , and there were some who wanted to surrender and legitimize quisling . 
  the king decided he would rather abdicate than doing so , and so the cabinet , standing by him , refused the ultimatum and continued to resist while retreating further . 
  there is [ a recent movie ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4353996/ ) about these events that i can recommend .
