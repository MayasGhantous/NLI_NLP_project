[ here 's a pdf ] ( http://www.norges-bank.no/upload/images/sedler_mynter/nyseddelserie/konkurranse/norges-nye-seddelserie-havet.pdf ) showing excerpts from all the contest entries . 
  personally i really liked the original backside of the winning entry `` det norske livsrommet '' , but i ca n't say i like the pixel-based design . 
  so you 're gon na throw people out of the country they were born in , just because of the actions their ancestral homeland ? 
  why should ethnic russians be punished for the actions of a country they 're not even a member of ? 
  [ 178 meters . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%b8lleh%c3%b8j ) you ca n't see it on the wikipedia image , as the farm blocks the view . 
  yeah , but [ some cucumbers are too big ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=no&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nrk.no%2frogaland%2fdenne-agurken-er-altfor-stor-1.11946900 ) to sell , so why not use them for something practical ? 
  czechia , we need to talk . 
  probably not the sami , they 're not a majority * anywhere . 
  well , written norwegian had kinda ceased to exist at that point , which is why we ended up making a new one . 
  two , actually . 
  i think he 's talking about the american embargo of cuba . 
  today 's weather forecast is [ gray !, 
  was n't rome 2.0 constantinople ? 
  at least she has some scandinavian royals that are her age . 
  i can sympathize with that , i had quite a bit of trouble finding reliable sources in norwegian back in my school days . 
  wish i knew about google scholar back then . 
  thanks for the sources , but this only seems to cover rising water levels . 
  i was talking about how the land itself is rising , not the ocean . 
  if i recall my geology class correctly , 2cm was the average . 
  the only other example i recall was that the area around gardermoen was rising 3cm a year . 
  is there any part of norway that is sinking , or rising faster ? 
  that did n't actually happen ; norwegian and danish , ( as well as swedish ) are independent branches of [ old norse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_norse ) . 
  same for norway , i think we 're rising about 2 cm a year . 
  votes , i think . 
  the red lines are probably the country they gave the most points to . 
  yay for low population density . 
  i 'm in bod\u00f8 , woke up to a winter wonderland yesterday , but most of it has melted by now . 
  norwegian here . 
  it snowed today . 
  well , norway has very rocky soil compared to the rest of europe , so `` stone '' or `` rock '' could work . 
  there 's nothing implying that london is n't in europe . 
  they had a tendency to send bombers down our coast some years ago . 
  so yes , it 's still something that lingers on our minds . 
  i love kosovo 's flag in this . 
  the problem is that most norwegians are somewhat ... 
  hesitant when it comes to unions . 
  ca n't say i 'd mind . 
  this is getting pretty aztec . 
  i wonder what the results for norway would be , considering the terrain . 
  fields in norway often used to be separated by stone walls . 
  these walls were entirely built out of rocks found in said fields . 
  and that is one of the many reasons for why norway focused on the sea . 
  i think that was a joke . 
  seems like the east vs west ad campaign just started . 
   criminal crime the best sort of crime . 
  i do n't know , let 's find out !, 
  and we 're not all that excited about unions . 
  that czechoslovakia is n't a thing anymore , the map is just old . 
  i was on my phone when asking that , the image is n't displayed on the mobile version of the site . 
  the image did n't show up when i viewed the site on my phone . 
  does anyone have a picture of these ` racist ' treats ? 
  i need this map on my wall . 
  well we got a bunch of our boats blown up , that counts for something , right ? 
  * right ? 
  is it a one-time fee ? 
  the alternative seems a bit too absurd . 
  the pacing is awful , though . 
  thank you . 
  i 'll check out the images once i get back to a computer . 
  i ca n't view the article on my phone , i keep getting redirected to a login page . 
  can someone post a summary ? 
  * they had lots of fun sending bombers down our coast a few years back , around 2008 or so . 
  * they used to be really fond of red . 
  * we had a fishing dispute with them until new aquatic borders were agreed upon . 
  ~ ~ after taking a quick browse of aftenposten and dagbladet , i think we can safely conclude that nothing of interest happened this week . ~ ~ edit : there was that bus thing . 
  yeah . 
  here in norway we show a czech cinderella film every christmas eve , it 's been dubbed in the same way as you described . 
  it has become a tradition to watch it . 
  i thought you had a norwegian flag as your flair , so your post really confused me . 
  i was like `` cloetta , really ? 
  what sort of norwegian are you ? '', 
  as a norwegian i think i can safely claim that they 're identical twins . 
  both are cain . 
  so many `` bl\u00f8ffs '' . 
  norway relevant !, 
  wait , he had contact with breivik ? 
  i ca n't really see them helping each other out , seeing how their ideologies kinda clash . 
  also , a norwegian princess is actively colluding with angels , so that probably helps . 
  hole shit , i remember playing that in kindergarten , must have been the first game i tried . 
  thanks for linking that . 
  most of them are literally the same as the swedish ones , but with the nationalities switched . 
  iceland best land, 
  ** `` mother russia is here '' **, 
  * 60 points cleared * what does it mean, 
  georgia is gone as well . 
  you will be missed . 
  guess estonia just got annexed . 
  those are some happy drummers !, 
  huh , must have missed that one , thanks for posting the links !, 
   ** in a small town on the western coast of iceland last week , authorities finally revoked a 400-year-old order that allowed basques to be killed on sight . 
  **  for the last four centuries people hailing from the basque country could have been legally hunted down and killed had they dared to step foot in iceland . 
   but last week , authorities finally repealed an order issued 400 years ago that led to the massacre of 32 basque whalers . 
   it came about after three basque whaling vessels entered a fjord in iceland during the summer of 1615 after reaching an agreement with the icelanders . 
   but when the ships were laden with their cargo and ready for departure they were shipwrecked in a gale . 
   the surviving basque whalers made it ashore but after a conflict with locals , ari magn\u00fasson of \u00d6gur , the then commissioner of the west fjords district ordered that they be tracked down and killed . 
   in october 1615 , 32 basque whalers were killed by the locals , an event that to this day is the only recorded mass murder in iceland . 
   when j\u00f3nas gudmundsson , the west fjords district commissioner , officially repealed the order on april 22nd at an event to inaugurate amemorial commemorating the ` slaying of the spaniards ' . 
   the commissioner joked : `` it 's safe for basques to come here now '' . 
   he added that the order had not been carried out for some years .
