  did he * veto * it , or did they just attend to his wishes concerning the matter ? 
  if i recall correctly , it was about the requirement that the king subscribe to the lutheran faith , right ? 
  edit : according to [ this ] ( http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/04/24/533482.html ) , he * did n't * veto it . 
  it was * those who were in fact elected * who changed their mind . 
  i was just about to post this over at / r/republicanism !,

   public finance has been tainted by corruption and collusion between politicians and private economic interests http://links.org.au/node/3356, 
  hey , all you other guys decided to hang with the southies . 
  only us and the iceguys left ... 
  what club is denmark left out of ? 
  sadly , yes . 
  there 's a near political consensus on * talking * much about `` life after oil '' and * doing * nothing . 
   be pissed off at your own crappy leadership . 
  are n't they , though ? 
  [ november 19th ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_men%27s_day ) . 
   ** abstract : **  constitutions usually do n't discriminate among different political ideologies . 
  while constitutions of nation-states impose certain limits on legislative politics , primarily through the protection of constitutional rights , it can hardly be argued that , on balance , they privilege one or another political ideology . 
  the eu economic constitution is , in this respect , different . 
  it systematically biases eu policy making in a neo-liberal direction . 
  historically speaking , this was not the intent of the eu founding fathers . 
  the original constitutional settlement of embedded liberalism was significantly redefined in the next major revisions of the rome treaty . 
   the neo-liberal foundations of the single market and the emu have imposed real and significant institutional constraints for progressive policy making . 
  however , the role of the european left was crucial in this alteration of the eu constitutional order . 
  despite the strong neoliberal consensus among the key political actors of that time , such a change would have not be possible without the left ' retreat towards centre-leftism , particularly in france . 
  furthermore , while constrains of the eu economic constitution are significant , we should avoid the naturalization of the eu , depicting it as an automatic upshot of a wholly impersonal logic ( hay , wincott , 2012 , 132 ) . 
  the european left , while in power , failed to leave its distinct imprint on the eu economic constitution . 
  the left policy agenda remained firmly embedded in the logic of the nation state . 
   the euro crisis pushed these developments even further and , for the first time in the eu history , explicitly challenged the constitutional balance of the eu legal order . 
  the new austerity union , a project in the making , profoundly altered this constitutional balance . 
  the new politics of austerity is both politically and economically flawed . 
  it threatens the very foundations of european integration . 
  the euro crisis thus represents both a challenge and opportunity for the left to offer an alternative response to the biggest eu crisis since its inception . 
  but in order to succeed , the european left must first reform itself . 
  the pes manifesto is a promising sign in that direction .

  fits well with the pacific ocean . . 
  [ the world . 
  yeah , that was my first thought as well . 
  riverton would have been clearer , but perhaps current is closer to the original etruscan meaning . 
  river , current , stream , estuary , creek , brook - i suppose the etruscans had as many words for river as the english . 
  i do n't know . 
  current can also mean river , i suppose . 
  anger is a `` meadow by a bay '' , as far as i can tell . 
  stav as in `` stick/staff '' ? 
  check out the legend . 
  edit : from wikipedia :  j\u01ebtunn ( proto-germanic * etunaz ) might have the same root as `` eat '' ( proto-germanic * etan ) and accordingly had the original meaning of `` glutton '' or `` man-eater '' , probably in the sense of personifying chaos . 
  rome = currenton ? 
  edit : never mind . 
  i found the legend . . 
  you missed `` during the preceding year '' . 
  thanks for the reply . 
  how and why did this mutation happen , in your view ? 
  and what can be done to stop it ? 
  i do n't know , really . 
  some people seem to think the problems of greece and spain are based on some people lying and cheating , and not on some systemic weakness . 
  i do n't know exactly to whom they refer . 
  my point was just to set up a basic dichotomy of `` system bound to create problems by creating socially unhealthy pressures and incentives '' vs. `` great system , it 's just some * people * who do n't follow the rules '' . 
  what does being a `` western agent '' entail , besides being photographed with politicians ?

  the problem i 'm talking about is `` too many students '' , [ as imagined by seb2242 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4b72a8/taxation_in_the_eu_detailed_version/d16uckc ) . 
  my reply was to the insinuation that free universities would necessarily mean more students , and the point was that tuition is n't the only way to ration a good . 
  and so the problem disappears . 
  then ration education by other means than the students ' ability to pay . 
  how long did all non-slave american women have the vote ? 
   but our slaves were africans , while in greece they had fellow greeks as slaves , very different how is that difference relevant to anything ? 
  sorry , but what 's ruk ? 
   i assume we are all adults here ? 
  this is the internet . 
  even adults are n't adults here . 
   governments legislate on this issue , to a certain extent they need to define the term , or at least create a definition for the legislation they create ... 
  i mean , if carrying out an act of terrorism is an offence , you do n't want the definition to shift wildly , you want that in the legislation . 
  of course . 
  i do n't know why you mention this . 
  i 'm not opposed to governments defining things for their own purposes . 
  that 's half the point of legislation . 
   more to the point though , this is something that has been shifting recently , it seems important for some people at the moment to be able to use the term terrorism to apply to governments i 'm not sure why you mention this . 
   i think to suggest an equivalency , even though that seems entirely unnecessary . 
  i do n't think many people would describe the actions of nazi germany or say the korean war as terrorism . 
  i do n't think either . 
   because i do n't think that in the past , we have traditionally associated terrorism with states ( they carry out other acts . . ) . 
  the first use of the word was in reference to state action . 
  that is , the 1795 reign of terror in france . 
   i do sometimes wonder if the sound of the word causes way too much confusion though . . 
  it 's not about causing terror as such ( at least not in context ) it is about the use of violence . 
  that 's the way the word was used in the beginning , and it 's been used that way since , as signifying a tactic of inciting * terror * in order to reach a political goal . 
  there may be violence , but the point of the violence is to create fear , not to conquer territory or to defeat military opponents militarily . 
  [ here ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20070129121539/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/terrorism_definitions.html ) are some of the definitions proposed by and for the united nations , most of which focus on the * terror * :  from 1937 ( league of nations ) : * all criminal acts directed against a state and * ** intended or calculated to create a state of terror ** * in the minds of particular persons or a group of persons or the general public * terror . 
  no mention of non-state actors . 
   from 1988 ( `` academic consensus '' definition ) : * an * ** anxiety-inspiring ** * method of repeated violent action , employed by ( semi - ) clandestine individual , group * ** or state actors ** , * for idiosyncratic , criminal or political reasons , whereby - in contrast to assassination - the direct targets of violence are not the main targets * again , anxiety-inspiring . 
  state actors specifically included . 
   from 1999 ( un resolution language ) : * `` 1 . 
  strongly condemns all acts , methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable , wherever and by whomsoever committed ; *  * 2 . 
  reiterates that criminal acts * ** intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror ** * in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes * ( ... ) again , terror is the intention . 
   from 1992 ( proposed by a. p. schmid ) : * act of terrorism = peacetime equivalent of war crime * this one is the odd one out , and more in line with your definition , no ?
