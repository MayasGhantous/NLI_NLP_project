  it 's closer to mine when explained further , though : * `` if the core of war crimes - deliberate attacks on civilians , hostage taking and the killing of prisoners - is extended to peacetime , we could simply define acts of terrorism as `` peacetime equivalents of war crimes '' * . 
  also , it was proposed as a legal definition . 
  proving an `` intention of inducing anxiety '' is not very practical , so it makes sense in that context to only focus on its target : innocents . 
  according to [ terrorism-research . com ] ( http://www.terrorism-research.com/ ) , the us department of defense defines terrorism as  * the calculated use of unlawful * ** violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear ; intended to coerce or to intimidate ** * governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political , religious , or ideological * . 
  more focus on the intention of creating fear . 
  no mention of it being only for non-state actors . 
  from the same source , here 's the definition from the fbi :  * terrorism is the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property * ** to intimidate ** * or coerce a government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives * no mention of it being non-state actors . 
  and the us department of state :  * premeditated politically-motivated violence perpetrated against non-combatant targets by sub-national groups or clandestine agents , * ** usually intended to influence an audience ** focus on the intention behind the violence : influencing an audience . 
  targets : civilians . 
  these guys got the memo on `` non-state actors '' , though . 
  ( although there 's definitely an opening for state terrorism in `` clandestine agents '' . ), 
  again , from the same source , the british government definition of 1974 :  * the use of violence for political ends , and includes any use of violence * ** for the purpose of putting the public , or any section of the public , in fear . 
  ** intention : fear . 
  the point in all this is not that i have the only possible definition of terrorism , but that saying that it excludes state actors ( and saying that it 's not about the `` terror '' but the violence ) requires one to disregard a number of important sources . 
  not only sources from our own day , but historical ones too . 
  this goes to show that it 's not just a story of recent alleged need for people to * expand * the definition , but a long on-going tradition of understanding terrorism simply as a tactic of fear . 
  edit : formatting . 
    i 'm not sure why the government 's definitions matter when there are dictionary ones . 
   largely because language changes and neither governments nor dictionaries are the definitive arbiter of what is correct . 
  i agree . 
  dictionaries strive to take account of the changes , governments do n't . 
  governments have a stake in how it 's defined , dictionaries do n't . 
  that 's two reasons to stick to the dictionaries . 
  do you have any reasons to go with the governments definitions before dictionaries ? 
   if there is a trend toward broadening a term ( especially to the point of uselessness ) , then surely the broadening of the term terrorism to include state actors is also problematic . 
  why ? 
  the latter does n't lead to the other . 
  besides , why do you speak of `` widening '' and `` broadening '' ? 
  why not speak of `` narrowing '' the term to mean only non-state actors ? 
   we already have decent descriptive terms for when government act abroad or against their own people no one is saying `` terrorism '' should mean government acting abroad or against their own people . 
  none of the dictionary definitions i provide says anything of the sort . 
   i 'd also point out that this started with a query about whether groups that only attack military/government targets are terrorists i did n't follow that query . 
  i jumped in when you said terrorism was by non-state actors * by definition * . 
   if terrorism is defined as simply any entity using force to pursue a political change , then almost any military action would fall into that category . 
  is n't it the * terror * that is the point of the label ? 
   a few dictionaries yes , [ and ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/terrorism ) a [ few ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/terrorism ) dictionaries * do n't * [ have ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/terrorism ) non-state [ as ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/terrorism ) a [ prerequisite ] ( https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/terrorism ) . 
   a reasonably large number of governments i 'm not sure why the government 's definitions matter when there are dictionary ones . 
  governments have different purposes with their definitions than do dictionaries . 
  in this case it 's hardly surprising to see governments keeping their own actions out of the definition . 
   i 'd agree that there is a lot of pressure to essentially define terrorism as ` bad people doing bad things ' regardless of whether it is a non-state group , a state or whether the victims are civilian or otherwise possibly , but that need n't worry us if we are simply trying to use a definition of terrorism with the terrorist 's state-status as irrelevant . 
   unfortunately at that point it simply loses all meaning . 
  yeah , but `` terrorism '' loses none of it 's `` meaning '' by by simply including state actors , does it ? 
  edit : i should say `` by simply * not excluding * state actors . '', 
  whose definition ? 
   it 's not like you 're going to need french or german once you leave the eu if you 're looking for business opportunitites anyway . 
   well , if they did n't want it , they could 've voted against it the way the us and the ukraine are portrayed ( as if they would n't condemn nazism ) illustrates why they did n't . 
   which europe seems so eager to defend . 
  well , apparently not .

  misleading headline . 
  someone wants you to * think * they did n't want to condemn nazism . 
  the resolution , however , is not about nazism , but about the glorification of nazism . 
  this makes it a * freedom of speech * issue . 
   the united states joined ukraine in voting against a united nations resolution condemning ** the glorification ** of nazism , citing freedom of speech concerns and saying russia sponsored the measure as a political attack against ukraine . 
  edit to add : [ here 's the voting record ] ( http://www.un.org/en/ga/third/71/docs/voting_sheets/l.45_rev.1.pdf ) .

  x-posted from [ r/socialdemocracy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/socialdemocracy/ ) . 
  yes , that 's one of the definitions . 
   contemporary social democracy , starting in the post-war period , was defined by reformation of capitalism to align it with the ethical ideals of social justice while maintaining the capitalist mode of production , rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system . 
  yes , that 's a wikipedia quote , but it happens to be right . 
  `` social democracy '' ** may refer to both ** `` old '' and `` post-war '' social democracy ( and even to the neo-liberal kind , of new labour and the like ) , [ like we do in the sidebar of r/socialdemocracy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/socialdemocracy/ ) . 
  much like the word `` liberal '' , it 's practically a dead-end to discuss it without pointing out which definition you are going to use ( the american `` liberal '' or the european `` liberal '' ) . 
  well , calling it * overbloated * welfare * spending * is sort of begging the question , is n't it ? 
  i like how one study is brushed off as an `` ideological pamphlet rather than a scientific study '' , while the author effortlessly writes about taxes as moving resources from `` the productive sector to the ever more inefficient government apparatus '' . 
  the scandinavian model is even `` wealth destructive '' . 
  the `` ideological pamphlet '' he refers to , apparently makes an intellectually dishonest error , while he himself has chosen the period where the `` nordic model '' became increasingly less `` nordic '' ( i.e. 
  moved to the right ) as object for study , without even mentioning it . 
  to top it off , his explanation for the alleged direct correlation between high taxes and low growth is `` as logical as it is simple '' -- even though it 's just speculation . 
  the last sentence about ireland is just the nail in the coffin , imo . 
  and vice versa . 
  unfortunately . 
   we are also lacking about 14.000 engineers of all kinds to do actual work here it does n't help that those of them who can , work in oil-related industries . . 
  and in expanding local and overseas oil production , making even more of the labour force and industry oil-dependent . 
  never mind . 
  you should crosspost this to [ r/humanrights ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/humanrights ) . 
  yes , it seems the media do n't want us to know !, 
  yes , but you do n't apply for each particular case .

  right ? 
  what the article neglects to mention , is that the comments were written 23rd of july , 2011 - ** the very day after the attacks ** , and presumably long before this person was appointed as a ** lay judge ** in the case . 
  naturally , he could have declined , citing his previous comments as a reason , but then again , he is a * lay person * , not a professional judge ( in fact , he is a receptionist ) , so he likely did n't consider his comments of any consequence . 
  edit : added receptionist and bolded some words .
