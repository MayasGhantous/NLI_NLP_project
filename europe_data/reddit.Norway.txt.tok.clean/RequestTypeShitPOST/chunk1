/ r/nocontext, 
  i love this one too . 
  sounds so cool in norwegian , same goes for the `` til valhall '' chants etc, 
  interesting , this combined with the movement away from oil production in norway seems like a big no i guess . 
  i wonder how much of europes total gas needs we could provide on full production . 
  then again the tv show ` occupied ' showed us how that scenario would go down, 
  joing the erasmus program was the best decision of my life . 
  bit of an awkward time to live in brussels due to terrorism and such , but i loved it . 
  nice city , nice people , loved the international atmosphere , got to travel a lot and cheaply ( !, 
  ) , also got a sweet internship that landed me a nice job back home . 
   do to fish in norway is a crime criminally tasty that is, 
  alternatively we could pay portugese football players with fish . 
  northern norwegian football teams will unstoppable !, 
  wooden racks of dead fish that is left out to dry . 
  depending on what you intend to do with it later it can stay up there for quite a while . 
  coming from someone who grew up with these ( north ) , the smell is quite distict, 
  but we like dry and chewey meat . 
  [ case in point ] ( http://www.torarvid.com/index.php/fotogallery/image?view=image&amp;format=raw&amp;type=orig&amp;id=263 ), 
  we should do a cultural exchange program where you get fish and we get football players, 
  they like our fish, 
  nope, 
  if you can not see the coin at the bottom , it is n't strong enough !, 
  at least its an improvement over the original proposition ... logistics will be a bitch in the north, 
  this is correct . 
  if you asked a northerner you will find that everything south of trondheim is southern europe . 
  your 's might be older , but we made a better one : ^ ), 
  all you need is a panzer tank and some cheat codes, 
   hipster nazis we live in the best timeline, 
   your score : 72 % ( 29 points out of 40 ) well i did n't want that citizenship anyway, 
  you 'll never beat the pesky finns with that attitude, 
  finland  netherlands yet again also suck it sweden, 
  nico le mans 24 hour winner fia platinum class sao paulo 2010 pole sitter see ya later h\u00fclkenberg  the rest, 
  there is no need to be upset : ^ ), 
  i recently visited barcelona and tried paella at a sea food resturant close to the beach . 
  it was great !, 
  a bit greasy to eat the shells and shrimps , but very enjoyable . 
  and this is coming from a fish nazi , 
  the music made this haunting, 
   the guy who won the eurovision for norway with europe 's skies is of belarusian origin ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ innnn ^ ^ loooooovee ^ ^ wiiithhhaaa ^ ^ faaaaaaiiryytaaaiiil ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ eeeevenn ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ thoo ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ huuuurts, 
  they have figured out that double negatives can be applied in real life too , not only mathematics . 
  so they put their wet clothes out in the rain , which makes them dry, 
  for those wondering about western norway : they live in a constant state of rain, 
  this comment chain sounds like something ken m would say, 
  i would certainly download her, 
  very much so !, 
  security is usually not user friendly , that 's why most people do n't bother with it . 
  as for email encryption its not that hard really , and safe as long as both parties have their keys secure . 
  sending something back north is even worse . 
  the packages are stuck in fauske for like 1 week, 
  you 're both assholes, 
  nordic yes , scandinavia no, 
  `` neutral '' hmm, 
  i was gon na hop on the `` sweden = gay '' train , but then i found my self humming to westlife . 
  fantastic song that, 
  i was visiting barcelona in january this year and it was around 11 degrees , but the sun was out so me and my brother was walking around in t-shirts and shorts , while the locals was dressed for the winter apocalypse . 
  i think they knew that we were tourists . 
  the colour scheme was nice at least, 
  the image the other dude linked is cloudy so might not be the best comparison . 
  he 's not wrong about the saturation part tho, 
  yeah , i got like 20gb for $ 45 . 
  but i think there were some student discounts in the picture, 
  at least we kind of got crimea . 
  must be windy over there since the flag is in a strange angle . 
  we took one for the team , boys . 
  are these people actually journalists ? 
  as in do they have an education ? 
  oil wont last forever and the agrarian sector is a huge part of the national identity . 
  we 're still a small country . 
  fishing export is a huge part of the local economy a lot of places , espcially in the north . 
  the edit related to fishing and farming is actually really important . 
  unless an agreement is made that keeps foreign fishing out of our waters , i really do n't see us ever joing the eu . 
  did n't expect hearing someone with my own dialect speaking portugues today, 
  ~ ~ around the same level as in norway ~ ~, 
  1 + for this ^ ^ this ^ ^ post ^ ^ is ^ ^ sponsored ^ ^ by ^ ^ the ^ ^ norwegian ^ ^ fishing ^ ^ industry, 
  those guys are a national treasure, 
  when i moved to belgium i had no knowledge of dutch at all , but even then i could understand most of the written sentences . 
  if you go by ops examples oostenrijk / \u00d8sterrike litouwen/litauen tsjechi\u00eb / tsjekkia but both languages are germanic so i guess we have a lot in common . 
  that being said you language is does not have \u00c6 / \u00d8 / \u00c5 so suck it, 
  i always found dutch to be easy to read for me ( norwegian ) , but once you start talking i get lost . 
  although flemish was a bit easier to understand, 
  but his grandson does yoda, 
  lofoten is very far north , but suprisingly mild because of the coastal climate . 
  but the thing is that the weather is extremely unpredictable . 
  the game might start out sunny , but with chilly temperature , and end up with clouds and rain . 
  if you 're planning on going there , i would recommend packing clothes for every situation . 
  does that mean that i 'm a bot ? 
  we usually say `` bane '' , which translates to pitch/turf . 
  not much else to call it since they are not actually stadiums , but rather just the pitches themselves . 
  i have , and this one is a bit funny because it is seemingly more popular outside of norway . 
  its a cool movie that captures the spirt of norwegian folklore in a nice way , but with a modern twist . 
  in norwegian tales trolls turn to stone when the sun comes up , so most of them look like mountains , and not like monsters in foreign movies, 
  i think its mostly community teams for kids and teenagers now , but i 'm not completely sure since i do n't live there anymore . 
  the local athletics club is called henningsv\u00e6r il . 
  seing as everyone was really shit , we lost quite a few over the years . 
  no trolls apart from the locals . 
  i personally liked the british isles . 
  london and manchester were cool , but gatwick is horrible . 
  fkl plays at stranda stadion in [ svolv\u00e6r  ( https://images.scribblelive.com/2014/5/16/73791704-8a1a-4dc4-b74c-c168e0f87fd6_800.jpg ) usually its just for fun and for lower tier clubs like henningsv\u00e6rs local team . 
  we played there when we were kids to teenagers . 
  yes , fairly mild climate because of the sea,
