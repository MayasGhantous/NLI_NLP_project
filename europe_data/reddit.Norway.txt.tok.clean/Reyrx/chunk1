yeah , as long as mandatory military service is a thing it is only fair for both genders to contribute . 
  although , from my personal experience from when i was in for service , the female soldiers we 're not on the male soldiers ' level when it comes to physical strength and had to be helped out numerous times with demanding tasks . 
  many of them were awesome shooters , though . 
  yes , its per month . 
  they say that this price will cover the costs of building the infrastructure as this speed is not something they are pushing as mainstream . 
  they are basically saying that if you want this kind of speed you can have , but you 'll have to pay for it yourself . 
  1gbit is a lot more reasonable at just under 200 euros per month . 
  at the moment i pay 50 euros for 20/1mbit asdl at another provider because that 's the only thing i can have . 
  it 's okay , but the 1gbit for 200 euros is pretty cheap compared to that . 
  yeah i know . 
  the price is supposed to cover the costs of building the infrastructure to your house . 
  as mentioned , it 's mostly to show what direction they are headed . 
  if you have the money and want it , you can have it . 
  they offer 1gbit for just under 200 euros though . 
  in norway in certain areas you will soon be able to get 10gbit symmetric fiber , for just under 2000 euros . 
  it 's more of a marketing gag from the provider 's part but they said they 'll offer it simply to show in what direction they are headed . 
  but the mere fact that you can get that speed is crazy . 
  nooo , you were faster than me !!, 
  funny thing ( well , not really ) , is that after ww2 germany allowed the us to build several surveillance stations in germany . 
  however these stations were not intended for use against the russians but against the germans . 
  the government knows about this and signed this treaty after the war . 
  the reasoning behind this is something along the lines of '' we do n't trust you and do n't want this to happen again '' . 
  this article is pretty interesting : http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/39/39408/1.html, 
  first of all i 'd like to say that not caring because you have nothing to fear is ignorant and the exact reasoning behind all of this . 
  you are being monitored without having done anything against the law . 
  the system is changing from innocent until proving guilty to the exact opposite . 
  you being monitored , both actively and passively , makes you a suspect until proven wrong . 
  that is what you should care about . 
  it is not about the nude pics in your emails and not about your online betting and 4chan posts . 
  it is about a fundamental right of privacy that the government is violating , legitimized by `` national security '' as the greater objective . 
  i understand that some people are okay with giving up their privacy for higher security standards . 
  i for one am pretty moderate on this topic . 
  i do n't give a shit about them reading my emails or looking at what i buy or what porn sites i 'm on . 
  it is about the greater perspective on this matter . 
  if you for one second believe that it will end with the nsa and the european equivilants just looking at your emails , then you are naiv . 
  the reason nothing is being done and why people are n't marching on the streets is because nothing is changing . 
  no one will notice any of this , thus they do n't care . 
  maybe they do care a little and find it outrageous to have both foreign and domestic spy on them , but as long as people do n't feel any physical changes nothing will be done . 
  raise the taxes by 3 % and everybody loses their minds . 
  last hope by paramore actually the complete new album is absolutely brilliant . 
  no offense , but is anyone actually surprised by european countries spying on their citizens and handing the intel over to the us ? 
  shit , i can not imagine what it must be like to lose all your belongings to the flood . . 
  does n't matter . 
  i approve this 100 % !, 
  so basically [ skandinavisme ] ( http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/skandinavisme ) ? 
  i would love that !, 
  but it was raining here for 20 minutes , 3 hours ago !!!, 
  now it 's warm and sunny again though . 
  not quite correct . 
  [ this ] ( http://reise.aftenposten.no/reise/tjener-grovt-pa-nordmenns-mobilbruk-i-utlandet-44167.html ) norwegian news article says , based on a report from the norwegian post & telecommunications authority , that norwegian providers make 68 % of their profit from none-domestic mobile use . 
  i do n't know if these numbers would apply for other countries and it is worth mentioning that our call , text and data prices are crazy low when compared to i.e germany . 
  fresh fish is not so hard to come by and for good quality fresh meat we can go to mer\u00e5ker at the swedish border an get locally produced meat specialties which are very good . 
  however , thats a 100km trip one way . . and i do not think that strangling mooses is healthy for you in the long run , 
  i have never seen a butcher . 
  the closest thing would be meat discs inside the supermarkets , but those arent ' t even remotely the same as the butchers i 've seen in germany . 
  also , we basically never see q-melk here , except for q-sjokomelk . . 
  yeah our variation and selection is a joke . 
  we only have two milk producers where on of the two has a market share of 80 + % . 
  in addition they are the ones producing almost all yoghurt , butter , cheese and related products . 
  our extremly protective socialistic market politics are a pain in the ass and kill all competition in order to support an unsustainable domestic production which receives subsidies beyond comprehension . 
  now prepare to be amazed : in norway we literally do not have butchers . 
  you ** have ** to buy meat at your local supermarket . 
  also , there are next to no bakeries , except for the huge bakery chains that have stores everywhere . 
  however , those are more like caf\u00e9s than bakeries . 
  at most of these you ca n't buy bread . 
  that leaves you with your local supermarket and needless to say , the bread sucks !, 
  it 's so incredibly fluffy with ** zero fiber ** !, 
  do n't even bother , he does n't have a clue . 
  but everybody loves sweden !, 
  even i do !, 
  yeah , i agree . 
  i guess i associate it with trance because it 's where i heard of armin van buuren and other trance artists for the first time . 
  but yes , it 's not much trance . 
  you are correct . 
  however , according to wikipedia it 's an electronic dance festival . 
  also , i.e armin van buuren is a trance artist/producer . 
  tomorrowland is a mix of house , trance and dance . 
  i do n't really see why everybody 's saying it was an obvious copycat attemp . 
  yes , glorious has the same kind of synth beat/melody , but that is standard eurodance/trance at the moment . 
  half the tracks at tomorrowland last year had this kind of beat . 
  it 's just mainstream in that music genre for the time being and the only reason people say it 's a copycat is because they do n't know that all dance/trance tracks are like this . 
  this still does n't change the fact that it 's a horrible song though . 
  remove the lyrics and you have a winner . 
  but ... they 're vikings !!, 
  just like us !, 
  i do !, 
  i love that one !, 
  holy shiiiit !!, 
  it 's a dobble zlatan !, 
  but . . but . . adam and eve . . 
  as a norwegian i dream of a gigantic bridge connecting the southern tip of norway with the northern tip of denmark !, 
  thanks for the link . 
  i just wanted to emphasize that ground water is a limited resource . 
  even worse , they drill large and deep wells in areas in pakistan to pump up the ground water , while the local population with their smaller wells is unable to retrieve any water , which in turn makes them dependent on [ buying their own water back from nestle . 
  ] ( https://action.sumofus.org/a/nestle-water-pakistan/ ), 
  i 'm not sure how good your geology is , but ground water is not an infinite resource . 
  you ca n't just drill holes and pump up the amount of water you need . 
  i 'm not sure how much of the ground water is used in poland , and what the capabilities are for expanding that , but ground water is a limited resource . 
  ah , could have worded that better . 
  it 's the smallest town in germany based on area .
