   in 2003 , the israeli central bureau of statistics reported that israel had surpassed the united states as the nation with the world 's largest jewish population . 
  the report was contested by professor sergio dellapergola of the hebrew university of jerusalem . 
  considered the greatest demographic expert on jews , della pergola said it would take another three years to close the gap . 
  [ 35 ] in january 2006 , della pergola that israel now had more jews than the united states , and tel aviv had replaced new york as the metropolitan area with the largest jewish population in the world , [ 36 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israeli_jews it matters in the sense that you want to be correct .

  you know , one thing i have learned is that i am way more concerned with the littlest of details than my peers . 
  ah shit , thanks for pointing out my mistake . 
  a 1.1 million gap is quite large would you not say ? 
  when it comes to such numbers i have always assumed that the lesser amount is the true figure . 
  that is why i am confident in saying that israel has a larger jewish population . 
    jew  largest number of any country in the world .
