  no one knows that the bastard churchill wanted to invade us far more than hitler ever did . 
  everyone * knows * that that germany always wanted to invade norway and make it apart of their reich . 
  everyone knows that every nazi was a crazy loon obsessed with the perfect aryan . 
  it is common knowledge that hitler was a deluded megalomaniac warmonger that started the war and invaded us just because they were evil and greedy and wanted to gas the 5 trillion jews living here . 
  here locally we had a sizeable german garrison . 
  the fact that the german soldiers were nice human people and the russian pow 's kept here was treated far more humanely than the us , the uk or japan ever treated theirs is n't really considered all that much . 
  we live in our dream world of good vs evil , and we sing up our own praises about our `` achievements '' in the war . 
  i expect we are much like every other country in that way . 
  yes . 
  of course i 'm proud of my country . 
  sure , i do n't agree with the way its going in modern times . 
  sure , i think our politicians are horse-shit . 
  sure , we are basically enslaved to foreign masters in brussels . 
  my people have built this country . 
  they have defended it , lifted it up , developed it . 
  millions and millions of people have fleshed this country out to what it is today , slaving away at sea or in snow , paying the price in blood and iron . 
  if i , a descendant and a member of this people , were n't proud of this , i would be a traitor . 
  i would be spitting on the graves of a million men , and i would n't be worth to walk on the ground i walk on . 
  my pride in my people is the strongest sentiment i have , and my people is norway . 
  certainly , modern times have tried to dilute the norwegian people , but we shall persevere . 
  this nation is our people , and i have the utmost faith in them . 
  my people is the most precious possession i have . 
  i could not be prouder . 
  is n't that right , though ? 
  the people that settled this land did n't settle it for themselves only - for their children , their children 's children and their future legacy . 
  the people that built your country did n't just build it for themselves , they built it for everyone - for you . 
  the people that fought for your country did n't fight for themselves , they fought for their family , friends , neighbours , countrymen , and their country . 
  they fought to secure a place for their descendants . 
  they fought for you . 
  not being proud of the hundreds of years and hundred thousands of people that have built a country is despicable . 
  your forefathers built your country for you , and you will defend it and improve it for your descendants to come . 
  that is the nature of a people . 
  pride is right , pride is good . 
  pride in your country is just . 
  only the british people have anything to say on this matter . 
  but as a foreigner , i 'd give a strong yes . 
  anything that weakens the eu is alright by me . 
  hopefully this could kickstart an effect that could end pigs in brussels imposing on other nations sovereignty . 
  and who , pray tell , will enforce this international law against the european union ? 
  i can count them on one hand , because there is n't anyone . 
  this seems to be a bait to get some real supremacists to chime in with anti-race mixing comments , face a hail of negative karma and the feel-good citizens of / europe can once again be good guys . 
  i 'm not biting . 
  i 'll just say that there wo n't be any negative opinions about your race if you date your own race , 
  how are they a responsibility ? 
  this is a union of the european people . 
  european heritage , european children , the well-being of all europe . 
  these people are not european . 
  they are the responsibility of themselves , and themselves only . 
  it is not our fight , it is not our struggle , and ultimately , it is not our concern . 
  we do other things as well , but nothing even comes close to the oil industry and pretty much everything else we do is done cheaper by people expecting a tenth of our living standard . 
  we 're not going to crash and burn without oil , nor will we suddenly become a worse place than denmark and sweden , but the rather massive cornucopia of abundance we are used to will disappear , and that 's not something to strive for : ^ ), 
  let 's see . 
  norway alone has no final form , i think . 
  we can keep sailing on the oil waves until they are n't anymore , and then we 'll be left with a lot of immigrants and not a lot of welfare anymore . 
  i think we were well on our way to our final form ( see map top right ) before the russians came and ruined it . 
  * damn russians !, 
  * i think now the only final form we can hope for is some sort of nordic union . 
  if we get to keep our oil monies , and sweden is forced to stop taking all these immigrants , i think we 'd have a jolly good time . 
  a nice capital on the beaches of denmark , with some sun . 
  yes , that sounds amazing ... :(, 
  paying all of greece 's debts ? 
  even as a theoretical scenario that makes me very upset . 
  this is why we are n't in the eu in the first place . 
  more importantly , we need our pension fund . 
  we have nothing but oil and no concrete plans for the future . 
  even with the massive interest , there clearly is n't enough to go around . 
  between lacking services all around the country and massive mismanagement spending parts of what we have on foreigners , paying anything for greece seems like the worst idea possible . 
  temporarily save greece in exchange for darkening our own future plans significantly ? 
  yeah , i think if the government proposed this we 'd have them toppled and replaced shortly . 
  1523 best year of your life ? 
  either way , scotland is n't too far fetched if they separate more from british values and cultures , but the baltics , no matter how hard they say otherwise , are eastern slavic , and does n't fit in at all . 
  finland , even with the language barrier , does , and so does iceland . 
  estonia , not so much . 
  required ? 
  who says , and who enforces that ? 
  a child molester or murderer has no redeeming values for society . 
  if possible , using them for forced labour indefinitely is an adequate solution . 
  otherwise , one thing eu really needs to learn from the us is that capital punishment certainly is n't outdated . 
  being born in the wrong part of the world is certainly no offence . 
  forcing your way onto foreign soil against their will and laws is a vile crime , comparable to an invasion . 
  ideally , they would only be rebuked , but in the case that they do successfully make it into european lands and refuse to leave nor give up their place of origin for a forced deportation , yes , i ** do ** think dumping them in the atlantic is deserved . 
  as far as i can see it , these are illegal invaders trying to force their way onto eu soil , and they should be prevented as such . 
  these rickety wooden `` ships '' they use to mount their invasions can barely survive the mediterranean waves , stopping them is no problem . 
  europe , and its people , are not responsible for a ** single ** person outside of its borders , and it definitely should n't pander to those trying to invade their territory . 
  if they make it in , and can not be realistically deported due to lack of documentation , a choice needs to be made . 
  we can stop our ridiculous pandering to * humanism * , or we can take them as they come and lose our culture bit by bit . 
  they can be deported . 
  i think the atlantic ocean has some international waters these undocumented foreign aliens could be deported to , if they wo n't state their country of origin . 
  i do not really appreciate being called a term like that , but i can see where you are coming from . 
  the cause ? 
  at its core , anti-immigration in norway was damaged severely from breivik 's actions . 
  they just evoked sympathy for his targets , and disgust at him and people associated with him - mainly , people sharing similar or semi-similar opinions . 
  incredibly deluded , to the point where it 's ridiculous that he was n't a plant . 
  such a foolish action brought more harm upon the cause than good . 
  `` any pr is good pr ? '', 
  not for a political cause , no . 
  god damn it . 
  yes , you have to make it so they do n't like it . 
  i do n't know about germany , but prison sentence in norway would be five stars luxury resort for anyone from middle-east . 
  even our resident mass-murder terrorist barely has any negatives , just a lot of isolation .
