take the hint , sweden !, 
  nobody likes you !, 
  you do n't know a lot about women . 
  we are shy , cold and distant . 
  do n't expect us to become your friend right away . 
  ( unless we 're drunk , in which case we 're on the complete opposite end of the spectrum and we love everyone . 
  fun fact , 100 % of norwegian socializing takes place while drunk . ), 
  i 'm questioning the credibility of those who partook in this survey . 
  i find it hard to believe that on average only about half the population of a country has watched porn . 
  everyone has watched porn , you liars . 
  i could probably have an entire conversation with a swede where i spoke norwegian and he spoke swedish . 
  easily . 
  a dane ... it would rely heavily on where in denmark he was from . 
  some danish dialects are easy to understand , some are complete gibberish . 
  a finn , not at all . 
  not one bit . 
  the languages are n't related . 
  unless they 're a finno-swede , but in that case they 'd be speaking swedish , not finnish . 
  and even then their accent would make it difficult to understand . 
  norway and sweden are n't really a father/son relationship . 
  all three of the scandinavian countries are more like brothers , where norway would be the younger brother constantly bullied by its two older brothers , who also hate each other . 
  but then we grew up and got an amazing job within the oil industry and now we 're rich and successful . 
  i 'm a strong independent country and i do n't need no dad !, 
  like father , like son . 
  til some really useless stuff about irnbru . 
  irnbru might be the best thing i have ever tasted . 
  i seriously doubt some of these numbers . 
  how come the scandinavian countries are lower than the uk , for example , where same-sex marriage is n't even allowed !, 
  how is that even possible ? 
  you stuck in the moat as well ? 
  appelsin masterrace reporting in, 
  stop feeding the troll dude, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  they sound nothing alike !, 
  0 :d to be fair , even some norwegians have difficulties using those correctly :p, 
  yeah , did not understand the last part . 
  but it 's alright , the aussie explained it to me . 
  i still think it 's a dumb part of your language , but at least i 'm now able to complain about it using correct pronunciation . 
  thanks anyway :p, 
  i honestly ca n't hear the difference between your w and v sounds in most cases . 
  we had an aussie exchange student last year , and he kept getting annoyed when we apparently said wikings instead of vikings . 
  i did n't know what the fuck he was on about really . 
  so it 's probably a germanic trait . 
  bare jokes , init ? 
  what the . . how . . that 's not even english !, 
  can other brits even understand that ? 
  how is that article relevant ? 
  ** cough * commonwealth * cough * *, 
  i support this . 
  horse is delicious . 
  no use in wasting it . 
  jokes on you !, 
  i do n't even know what that is !, 
  [ the scale might be a * tiny * bit off ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v7qmxaa.png ) , but i think this is close enough . 
  is n't portugal just spain 's coastline ? 
  icken bicken backen bocken jijjaajijijij !, 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm just trying to fit in . . 
  that would work, 
  they do n't have the proper flags to join the cool-countries-club . 
  i did n't see them because i had already drawn a red line over them . 
  i 'm sorry , orkney , i love you baby !, 
  never !, 
  no , but seriously , this is how i see it http://i.imgur.com/ihfzj.png, 
  this is about right , i believe . 
  http://i.imgur.com/a8bry.png edit : just realized now that our oilfields might look like a turd . . 
  good thing you caught that, 
  that was traumatic . 
  not so much because sweden won , but we got beaten by not just one , but * two * americans !, 
  the horror and the shame . . 
  i think just bollocks is the bad one . 
  dogs bollocks are good , for some reason . 
  get your shit together , tr\u00f8ndelag , you 're making us all look bad . 
  woah , hey now !, 
  what 's this ? 
  i thought we were bros , finland !, 
  i do n't understand . 
  are you saying norwegians do n't have feet ? 
  personally i would accept nothing less than a helicopter, 
  what do we look like , peasants ? 
  breivik is not a physical danger to anyone in prison . 
  the man is a coward , and there is nothing for him to gain on randomly killing inmates . 
  it was a summercamp for teenagers . 
  he 's being kept in isolation for * his own * safety , though . 
  not the safety of the other inmates . 
  there 's a bounty on his head , and many prisoners have expressed plans for killing him on sight . 
  being a civilized country is worth the cost . 
  it 's not really a * loophole * , though . 
  i mean , it 's by design . 
  it 's meant to keep potentially dangerous individuals locked away until deemed fit to rejoin society . 
  then norway is n't a utopia then , is it, 
  this marks the end of western society as we know it . 
  chaos now rule the streets of london . 
  i think you mean jemtland , herjedalen and b\u00e5huslen , rightful norwegian clay . 
  oh thank god , it 's a * normal * mass shooter this time ... 
  more like carolus rekt, 
  what 's more metal , [ frollocking around a pole ] ( http://www.visitsweden.com/imagevault/images/id_1487/conversionformat_13/scope_0/conversionformattype_jpeg/imagevaulthandler.aspx ) , or [ setting shit on fire ] ( https://imbo.vgc.no/users/protokoll/images/a5661f91fe3377e289906a60e671635d?accesstoken=47169952bcf925412729626ad94e5503832537f5ca973eae3981e7959a215002 ) ? 
  we celebrate midsummer better than you as well . 
  remove svenske from premises . 
  rabblerabblerabblerabble !, 
  should n't have pissed off the british and let our fleet burn in the copenhagen harbour .
