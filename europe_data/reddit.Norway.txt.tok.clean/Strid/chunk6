  they were n't belgians , stop lying . 
  they were n't belgians , stop lying . 
   believe that all muslims think the exact same who said that ? 
  that 's a strawman . 
  and i 've met plenty of muslims , that 's another strawman . 
  fyi : i grew up in the east of oslo . 
  not all muslims are extremists , nobody said that . 
  but too many so-called moderates support sharia etc , there 's tons of statistics on it . 
  islam is in no way compatible with western way of thinking . 
  we 're seeing leftists trying to justify children brides here now , `` they come from a different culture '' , `` the child-bride only has the husband '' etc. 
  in sweden and denmark , children brides are allowed to stay with their husbands in asylum centres . 
  we 're not allowing stuff that we used hundred of years to get rid off , all in name of cultural relativism . 
  the quran is meant to be taken literally , the bible is n't . 
  one of the religion 's founder preached forgiveness and kindness , the other did n't . 
  one of the founders was a pedophile warlord , the other was a peaceful carpenter . 
  way to defend terrorism , what the hell is wrong with you ? 
   or are you counting famine as `` killing '' ? 
  the holodomor in ukraine was a deliberately caused famine . 
  it was killing , also this one in china . 
  the thing is that very much of what you could called conspiracy right-wing nutters said turned out to be true . 
  police should report facts , not hide them . 
  it 's not up to them to interpret them , but the people need to know what 's going on . 
  that 's what happens in a free , democratic society . 
  how else could we form opinions if we 're not given the whole picture ? 
  with media and police covering up cases related to immigrants for years , is it really that strange that alternative media is growing there ? 
  here in norway we have very little of them , but you have many in sweden . 
   the whole reason why they ran from their home country was because extremists had fucked it up , now they want to fuck it up again the only thing they are fleeing are themselves . 
  holding a passport does n't make you french . 
  what if it was xer ? 
  forgot the / s ? 
  that something is a social construct does n't mean that it 's not real . 
  the sad thing is that many `` moderate '' muslims support sharia etc. 
  the muslims drinking and raping in cologne were moderates ... 
  i guess they also remember centuries of muslim attacks , especially from the ottomans . 
  yeah , it 's good we 're deporting people who do n't have any grounds for asylum . 
  i just wish everyone was doing it . 
  and then we have this : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41u373/nearly_four_million_migrants_will_come_to_europe/, 
  they are not refugees . 
  if they are , how did 1.1 million end up in germany instead of the first country they set foot on ? 
  refusing to apply to for asylum because the country has poor benefits make you a migrant , not a refugee . 
  are you trying to compare it to the recent migration ? 
  that 's really far-fetched . 
  there 's no ethnic element and jews did n't organise mass rapings and robbings of europen woman in multiple cities ... 
  and where 's scandinavia ? 
  [ german journalists instructed to paint refugees in a favorable light . 
  ] ( http://www.focus.de/kultur/medien/uebergrueffe-in-koeln-wdr-journalistin-klagt-an-wir-sind-angewiesen-pro-regierung-zu-berichten_id_5218836.html ) a journalist from the west german broadcasting cologne ( wdr ) has claimed in dutch radio that the german media has been asked to report positively about the refugee policy of the government . 
  the broadcaster is appalled . 
  the statements of a journalist from the west german broadcasting raise questions concerning the independence of the public broadcaster . 
  in an interview with the dutch radio station l1 , claudia zimmermann said of the media coverage during the refugee crisis : `` of course we are instructed to report pro-government . '', 
  according to `` tagesspiegel '' the program was about the sexual assaults on new years eve and the current mood in germany . 
  when asked whether they had to report about refugees in a positive way on wdr , the freelancer answered : `` we are a public broadcasting station and therefore instructed to tackle the problem in a positive way . 
  this began with the welcoming culture of merkel until the moment when the mood changed and there were more critical voices from the media and also the politic . '', 
  the orders come from a number of committees . 
  the journalist said that the oders originated from a number of committees . 
  the public broadcasting is designed to report more in favor of the government . 
  the wdr contradicted the statements of the free associate vigorously . 
  `` this represents in no way to the attitude of the company , '' said the deputy spokeswoman ingrid schmitz to the `` tagesspiegel '' . 
  do n't be so brainwashed , we all know it was a cover-up : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12085182/cover-up-over-cologne-sex-assaults-blamed-on-migration-sensitivities.html http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/tensions-rise-in-germany-over-handling-of-mass-sexual-assaults-in-cologne and many more ...

   a wikipedia article about a different country , with contested neutrality , and that is slated for deletion , is not very convincing . 
  check the comments on the reasoning for deletion . 
  you 're not refuting anything , you 're just trying to make excuses . 
  with european women having men like you defending them , no wonder this entire continent is going to shit . 
  they certainly were . 
  why are you trying to downplay it ? 
  [ cologne new year 's eve ` rape mob ' attacks were planned : minister ] ( http://www.news.com.au/world/europe/cologne-new-years-eve-rape-mob-attacks-were-planned-minister/news-story/689821299fd8bc4162598e7438699a9a ) and there 's many other articles about it . 
  you do n't know about [ taharrush gamea ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taharrush_gamea ), 
   and who 's comparing anything to the holocaust ? 
  i 've seen many of my fellow norwegian do it in recent days , and also in reddit . 
  there 's been many cases from muslims who want to play the victim card and use that , which is a bit ironic considering what their holy book says on jews . 
  that does n't give them any right to come here at all . 
  even eastern europe is n't good enough for them . 
  should the native populations of eastern europe move to the west if they are not happy ? 
  how can you be so sure ? 
  with what happened in germany and sweden , both police , media and politicians tried to cover it up . 
  in sweden they were successful for 2 years . 
  for those who do n't know about the rotherham rapes , it was mostly muslim ( pakistani ) men behind that as well . 
  if they do n't want to tell us where they are from , we can air-drop them over africa or the middle-east . 
  their choice . 
  europe has to take stronger measures . 
  since when did jews or ukranians plan mass rape of european women in multiple european cities at the same time ? 
  there 's no racial element to the refugee situatation , i 'm sick of people comparing it to the holocaust . 
  tolkien took that from us !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aurvandil he was also heavily inspired by finnish mythology , namely the kalevala . 
  i recommend tolkien 's book `` kullervo '' if you 're interested in it , but if you 're a new tolkiner reader , i 'd go with the hobbit then lord of the rings . 
  then perhaps silmarillion and the children of h\u00farin . 
  fascism did n't have a racial element . 
  there were jews in the italian party , but after pressure from germany , they were kicked out . 
  many isis members come from backgrounds drinking alcohol etc. 
  you 're so damn cute and gullible . 
  you 're really living up to your nick . 
  how is it being so naive ? 
  the good things about bubbles are that they eventually burst . 
  poor european women and girls with persons such as you . 
  good luck in the usa . 
  i have been looking at some places there too , amongst them alaska . 
  i guess the midwest could be pretty ok too , minnesota etc. . .
