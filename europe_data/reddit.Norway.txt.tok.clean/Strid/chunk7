  the best would of course be that europe fixed itself . 
   but they 're not islamists , they 're not even practising muslims ffs you 're right , these rapist and robbers were the so-called `` moderate '' muslims . 
  i would n't mind moving to poland if western europe does n't change its course . 
  if you 'd have us ... 
   well lucky for us , norway does track crime by citizenship and you 're in for a big surprise if you look at them . 
  lucky for you , i 'm norwegian and immigrants ( third worlders ) are overrepresented in rape and violence crime , i do n't doubt that it 's the same in other european lands . 
  that norwegians have become much , much more peaceful are distorting the stats . 
  why should immigrants get the statistical benefit of norwegians becoming more law-abiding ? 
   better low qualified employment opportunities lol . 
  norway has high unemployment and it 's rising . 
  there 's only so many jobs we have that you can do with no skills and not knowing the language . 
  the refugees barely know their own language , they will need years of school for anything . 
  xenophilia everywhere ... 
  [ norway wants to j\u00f6in in with \u00f6ur l\u00f6vely m\u00f6\u00f6se .

  so cute how naive you are , 
  unemployment is rising , we do n't even have jobs for those who speak the language . 
  lets not kid ourselves , few of these will work anyway . 
  he 's not from finland , he 's based on odin . 
  a kenning for odin is j\u00f3lnir . 
  also check the wild hunt : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wild_hunt, 
  have n't heard of any migrants being raped by europeans , but we 're seeing cases where the so-called refugees are raping europeans , even children have suffered it . 
  here in norway they will have an `` information meeting '' at an asylum center where two men had molested a norwegian girl . 
  i ca n't believe the men were not put in jail right away or deported . 
  they were not colonists , there were millions of people there before . 
  iceland is a better example . 
   immigration , its what my country was founded on i do n't think native americans appreciate the high levels of immigration though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_hawaii#overthrow_of_the_kingdom yes , seems very peaceful . 
  if they were legitimate asylum seekers , why would they need to be smuggled ? 
  but yes , very tragic :(, 
  there was tons of issues there long before the west started to meddle . 
  sadly , some behave like this too : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nktelr7svec, 
  i have no problems with russia killing is members . 
  but you 're right , it 's sad if civilians who do n't support or sympathise with is gets caught in the crossfire . 
   christian fundamentalism . 
  no better than islam fundamentalism . 
  how many europeans were killed this year by christian fundamentalists ? 
  islamists killed over 400 .

  the director admits that they are trying to find more affordable places , but there will also be many more expensive ones . '', 
  they are not refugees when they move through entire europe to come to richer countries . 
  they are economic migrants . 
  i dunno , they even let pakistani people here apply for asylum . 
  they should just turn them away right at the border . 
  we have such a backlog it will take ages to go through them , and most will get a positive answer . 
  and bohusl\u00e4n . 
  we want our rock carvings back . 
  saw an iman on tv who lived in norway since frigging 1990 who did n't speak norwegian . 
  they had to use an interpreter . 
  if you 're not in league with them , why is turkey buying most of the is oil ? 
  how are they able to interrogate the hundreds of thousands of people coming ? 
  i really doubt they have the logistics . 
  hard to recruit in isolation . 
  good that he 's dead though . 
  are they gunning down people , blowing them up and having rape gangs ? 
   imaginary lines . 
  you what ? 
  borders mostly follow ethnic groups . 
  yes , at least two . 
  too bad the kurds are also looting the archeological sites , almost as much as isis is doing . 
  reading kullervo now . 
  he wrote it in his student days , way before lotr , the hobbit and silmarillion . 
  the book is based on the finnish kalevala and was recently published . 
  we learned about that book when i had norwegian in high school . 
  i 've wanted to read it ever since , i 'll have to get a copy soon . 
  guess it 's really worth getting a nice hardback for displaying . 
  i 'm norwegian . 
  knut hamsun - growth of the soil . 
  that 's the one he won his nobel 's prize for . 
  it 's mainly about a man named isak sellanr\u00e5 who moves into the forest and creates a life for himself . 
  he later gets a wife and kids . 
  pan and hunger is also great books by him . 
  erlend loe 's doppler series is also great . 
  it 's about a guy who gets sick of society and moves in the forest , where he adopts an orphaned moose named bongo . 
  there 's absolutely nothing to gain , only loss . 
  that 's bullshit , automation is expected to do maybe as much as half the jobs in coming decades . 
  speaking for norway , unemployment is rising . 
  and it 's not exactly engineers or doctors coming , as we were led to believe earlier . 
  why should german men fight and die for them when the syrians do n't want to do it themselves ? 
  not common to have that low rent with utilities at all . 
  it 's not as black and white as you said in your original comment , that 's just what i 'm trying to show you . 
  are they really far-right though ? 
  and they still want immigration . 
   there is no proxy war in afghanistan , the government is fighting islamist insurgents . 
  those insurgents are not supported by any major power .

   perhaps later generations , but not these ` fleeing ' right now . 
  they will never be a profit . 
  france has had third world immigrants for 40 years , and the second and third generation is still not integrated . 
  would n't it be better to encourage native people to have more children rather than importing millions of non-europeans ? 
  many whom do n't want to integrate and work , few who have any kind of loyalty to the country ? 
  smaller populations could even be good for us . 
  lack of workers give the working class better conditions , and as many as half of jobs can be automated within the next decades . 
   the europeans could have saved them if they really cared about the refugees . 
  they could have sent ferries for them instead . 
  the fault is on none others than the parents for taking their kids on such a dangerous journey . 
  the only thing europeans should do is turn away all the boats , so nobody will risk it .
