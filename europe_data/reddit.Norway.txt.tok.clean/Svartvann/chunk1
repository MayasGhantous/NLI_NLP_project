nope, 
  perhaps less deadly , but the long-term consequences are worse . 
  and instead of a local problem this shit is spread all over the planet . 
  i dont understand way they use a photoshopped picture of reine when we actually have a place in norway that is why more `` village '' in the continental european meaning .

  http://www.rif.no/nytt-fra-rif/2015/norges-tilstand-2600-milliarder-i-etterslep/  today ceo of rif liv kari skudal hansteen presented the report norway 's condition 2015 - state of the nation . 
  it shows that the backlog of maintenance and needed upgrading of infrastructure is staggering 2600 billion nok . 
  with the new government we are just now scratching the surface on the backlog on the roads and railways . 
  sadly a big part of the norwegian population are retards , and vote on parties who like to push the problems on the next generation . 
  i can promise you that norway has not over-invested in infrastructure !, 
  the danish people will have a hard time understanding you , and if you learn norwegian ( bokm\u00e5l ) you get written danish gratis . 
  if your plan is to remove finland more from the other nordic countries , than not learning swedish is a good idea . 
   you get subsidised the most out of any other part of the uk so how exactly does this work then ? 
  how are they being subsidised ? 
  an independent scotland would have been on par with norway . 
  so the way i see it scotland is subsidising the uk . 
   you get subsidised the most out of any other part of the uk how is this possible when the big oil fields in the uk is in scottish waters ? 
  ( rightfully norwegian clay ! ), 
  the article is talking about the swedish asylum system collapsing not the swedish state .

  `` in 1468 orkney was pledged by christian i , in his capacity as king of norway , as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter margaret , betrothed to james iii of scotland . 
  as the money was never paid , the connection with the crown of scotland has become perpetual . '', 
  danmark owes us a lot of money !, 
  $ 802.6 billion https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_pension_fund_of_norway we are the largest stock owner in europe :d, 
   devils roasted hell d\u00e6ven han steike i h\u00e6lveta = the devil burn in hell faen = fanden = devil, 
  interesting , norway have the safest drivers in europe . 
  because it sure as hell is not the roads that 's responsible for the low number of deaths . 
  `` in scandinavia and eastern-europe the spread of christianity also mostly happened slowly and peacefully and was n't really coupled with war and conquest ( with some arguable exceptions like buglaria ) . '', 
  just no . 
  the spread of christianity was very brutal and bloody in scandinavia and the baltics . 
  how modern of you . 
  after fucking up sweden , what 's next on the agenda ? 
  8-9 years ago , 
  woosh, 
  it 's the same company and turbine is twice . 
  norway is the nordic champion with 2 companies :d, 
  the old euro coins was glorious without norway . 
  it was almost as we stayed out just to make sweden a limp dick . 
  the abbreviation of norway is nor . 
  or did you intend to include new york & company , inc. in the north sea union ? 
  what ? 
  finnmark is a part of norway . 
  so some parts of usa is great and some parts is shit ? 
  so what you 're saying is that usa is just average . 
  how the flying fuck do norway get rank 93 on health & well-being ? 
  salty much, 
   for submarines germany and norway what ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_regions_by_past_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita #europe _ 1830 . e2 .80.931938 _ .28 bairoch .29 we were one of the richest countries in europe long before we found oil . 
  from the comment section of the article  `` rosco7010 '' you need to look at the meat market in norway . 
  they consume far more deer , reindeer and game meats . 
  much of it is `` farmed '' in a similar way to the hill farming of sheep in the uk , which of course means the difficulty in administering antibiotics will out weigh the advantage . 
   of course norway has a far lower population density than the uk , as does ireland and austria . 
  so the comparison is a bit unfair . 
  if we want beef fed on uk farms and be virtually self sufficient , then to satisfy a 60m plus population , grazing alone is n't enough . 
   not that i support the use of antibiotics in animal rearing , but the reasons are more complex than a simple right or wrong . 
  stupid people never ceases to amaze me , 
   `` spain now uses 100 times more antibiotics per unit of livestock than norway , 80 times more than iceland and 35 times more than sweden . 
  the main reason for the difference is that spain , like most of europe , allows routine mass medication , whereas the nordic countries do not . 
  the increased use of last-resort and critically important antibiotics is particularly alarming and confirms that reliance on voluntary and softly-softly approaches is not working . '' god damn stupid fuckers !, 
  it 's just a waste to be diligent in class , when the retarded child in the back of the room is dragging everyone down with him . 
  nope https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_archipelagos_by_number_of_islands, 
  nope https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_archipelagos_by_number_of_islands, 
  the lenght of norwegian coast with the islands included is 100 915 km . 
  well then my comment is worthless , but i support the law . 
  i can promise you that the eu will go to great lengths to include norway and switzerland in the union . 
   so why on earth would they be allowed into the euro ? 
  hehehehehehehehe if norway had a collective insanity day tomorrow and wanted to join eu or the euro we would have been allowed in so fast that no one understood what happened . 
   so why on earth would they be allowed into the euro ? 
  hehehehehehehehe if norway had a collective insanity day tomorrow and wanted to join eu or the euro we would have been allowed in so fast that no one understood what happened . 
   see that 's the issue in europe . 
  no one wants to intervene overseas but when we find allies willing to fight there we blame them for the world 's misery . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  france has been doing shit work overseas for centuries , great briten and france is more or less responsible of all the idiotic borders that creat conflict today . 
  and you want more of that ? 
  are you an idiot ? 
  this quick ? 
  is 14 years quick in your book ? 
  it 's like a bad divorce , and uk is the ugly bitch in this analogy . 
  you asked about the connection between the norwegian - russian border and schengen . 
  you made it sound like it 's no connection between the two . 
  norway is number uno , so this has to be correct . 
   what does schengen have to do with the norwegian-russian border ? 
  it 's a schengen border . 
  are you kidding or serious ? 
  you know nothing about norway or farming in norway ? 
  wales hides behind england for a reason . 
   very surprised at germany though , i thought it was the country where everyone had a degree ? 
  i would think the apprenticeship system in germany is some of the reason . 
  we have the same system in norway . 
  so you either have a tertiary education or a certificate of apprenticeship . 
  italy ? 
  what the hell . 
  in a western european context he is correct . 
  a few years ago the local papers used to print the tax returns of all the citizens of the various communes . 
  and made a top 100 list . 
  yes , the sheep is unguarded . 
  it 's a border population shared between norway and sweden . 
  68 is the `` norwegian '' part of this inbred project that the swedes has created . 
  and i would think you use shepherds with the sheepdogs in romania ?
