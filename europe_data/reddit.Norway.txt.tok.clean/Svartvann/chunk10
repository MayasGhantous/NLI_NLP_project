  fuck posten norge , and a big fuck you to eastern norway . 
  super ninja edit : wrote post nord when i meant posten norge . 
  but fuck post nord too . 
  all our brightest minds work in oil . 
  i checked the sources , norway is hit hard on `` sub-pillar 2.2 . 
  tertiary education '' it does not take into account the trade school system we have in norway . 
  and also `` sub-pillar 3.3.3 iso 14001:2015 sets out the criteria for an environmental management system and can be certified to . '', 
  and `` sub-pillar 5.3 . 
  knowledge absorption '' `` sub-pillar 6.3 . 
  knowledge diffusion '' `` sub-pillar 7.2 . 
  creative goods and services '' we are obviously bad in a lot of things . 
  50 % of the population lives in east norway and they are guaranteed snow every year , and about 9 % of the population lives in tr\u00f8ndelag who is also guaranteed snow . 
  boom 70 % of the population of norway is guaranteed snow . 
  do you think its by magic that we are the most winning nation in winter olympics ? 
  i 'm well aware about the weather on vestlandet , but the picture is from northern norway . 
   and norway has most of its population along the coast where it practically never snows never snows ? 
  where the hell do you live ? 
  you have being nice . 
  so we are going to take this away from you , and you are going to thank us for doing it . 
  canada has almost no population north of 53 \u00b0 32 \u2032 27 \u2033 n , how is that `` great white north '' ? 
  99 % of your population lives south of the southes point of norway . 
   stavanger the motorway are from stavanger to sandnes , connecting a living and work region of 234242 people , after sandnes you have to drive to kristiansand to have a big concentration of people again . 
  it 's about as realistic as the refugees we have received going back after whatever war they received asylum for ends , so zero chance . 
  you are just moving a difficult problem to future you , and he is not going to like it . 
   right now , deal is about giving them papers which would let them to stay for 5-10 years . 
  does anyone seriously believe that people are going to leave after 5 to 10 years ? 
   what are norway 's issues ? 
  sustainable fishing , nobody seems to care about it in the eu . 
   we would rather bomb brussels than join eu . 
  easy there cowboy . 
  it 's obvious that you have never tried whale meat . 
  or if you have , it was someone not familiar with the meat who prepared it . 
  hungary did an excellent job during the crisis , i 'm talking about the relocation of immigrants afterwards . 
   because they do n't want solidarity with poor countries . 
  the 2015 migration crisis showed how much the solidarity works the other way , the poor countries can fuck off . 
  you sure about that ? 
  my impression after visiting florida was that ford f150 and f350 are the only sold cars in that state . 
   like your stereotypical belgian [ stereotypical belgian ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=inspector+poirot&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewinkd2hxqhuahwekywkhd2jd90q_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950 ) [ stereotypical belgian ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=doctor+evil&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj0tp3dxqhuahxh1ywkhehlak4q_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950 ), 
   why should we give up our tax rate to help people in france ? 
  such humility and team spirit . 
  eu must be a wonderful union , shame norway has not joined . 
  edit : i dont know how i managed to write much instead of must . 
   norway is probably the richest country ** in the eu ** when it comes to natural resources . 
  eu or no eu the oil money + fish exports are more than enough for such a small population . 
  how so ? 
  it would not make the oil and gas demands of europe vanish . 
  thanks, 
  well idiots are the majority . 
  if you want to find norway on a list , just look to the top . 
  i gladly pay my taxes . 
  as always something could be better , but overall norway is one of the best run countries in the world . 
  as long as the eu has a useless fishery policy i hope we stay out . 
  ** united states ** of america and united ** mexican ** states . 
  you see the difference ? 
  aaaa fuck it , i 'm not even sure myself what the point i 'm trying to make is :d, 
  no one is going to drive to norway because of cheap medicine  or anything cheap for that matter . 
   well , there are certainly united states in m\u00e9xico located in america , amirite ? 
  the country name is united ** mexican ** states . 
  because if eu = europe then it will be a short time before norway is not part of europe . 
  and i like being a european . 
  the united states of america means the ** united states ** of america as in the states that is united , located in america . 
  not america is the united states . 
   the eu is europe . 
  no  the eu is a part of europe . 
  yes, 
  it 's annoying as hell , as a norwegian watching eu trying to make itself synonymous with europe . 
   sure eu does n't contain all of europe but it does contain the only parts of europe that actually matter . 
  and finland . 
   many northern europeans are arrogant   its just a proof of their naivety tell me more . 
  this is about oversight , norway is not letting bumfuckistan take over oversight of critical oil transportation because some bureaucrats in brussels who are not capable of managing a starbucks , thinks it 's a good idea . 
  statoil is not the only player in the norwegian oil sector , and helicopter services are used on more then just production platforms . 
   i do n't think they would stop caring about safety because it is n't required by law . 
  wow , the oil sector worker 's can rest assured that a dude in france thinks that corporations have the good of the people at heart . 
  so what you are saying is that we can just remove norsok ? 
  because money trumps safety all the time , and if a foreign company operating in norway wants to use a foreign supervised helicopter services under eu rules what are norway going to do ? 
  it 's not because we want to protect `` norwegian '' helicopter services . 
  we want to protect norwegian oversight . 
  no one cares who are flying the helicopters as long as they are following norwegian standards and supervision , it 's the part where the company is going to be supervised from the country it 's located that norway do not agree on . 
  so tell me , which countries do you think have the experience to supervise helicopter services over the north sea ? 
  austria with its vast oceans ? 
  or maybe luxembourg with it 's long history of offshore oil exploration ? 
  really ? 
  a weird thing ? 
  it 's weird that we do n't want to hand over a industry that is more or less just norway and the uk that has any experience with ? 
  fuck that noise , and fuck the eu who stick its nose where it do n't belong !, 
  in the past the teacher was a authority figure , someone you have to respect , now students could n't give a flying fuck about the teacher . 
   did n't you promise some peak to poor finland , and then decided to not deliver in the end ... ? 
  we got all the media coverage we needed without even giving them the mountain top . 
  we call it a win-win, 
   mountainbike seems excessive, 
   your country twice voted against eu membership how is that retarded ? 
  we were given a shit deal and we reject it ? 
  norwegians are not stupid !, 
  yes , germany has done a lot horrible shit !, 
  i 'm fairly sure they are not gon na deny the genocide of herero and nama . 
  who wants to cover the shit pie that is africa ? 
  europa has nothing glorious going on . 
  south africa is barely functioning , but germany has not anything to hide , the genocide of herero and nama is nothing compared to the genocide of the jews and the gypsy . 
  you live in germany ? 
  if not fuck off !,
