   pretty cost effective tho , lock this guy up for life or end his life . 
  one of those options is cheaper . 
  yes , this one :  [ lock this guy up for life ] ( http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty ), 
  i feel sorry for the flatland apes down south , now they have nothing . 
  sweden has rape and murder / s , finland has top notch schools . 
  iceland , something something fish and incest . 
  denmark just has alcoholism and bacon left . 
  norway stealing all the international spotlight :d, 
   it could cost 10 euro in a top western state . 
  double that . 
  yes you frenchmen are some sick fuckers . 
  in what way ? 
  we are harvesting resources from the ocean , something we have done millenniums . 
  that some european countries have a selective morality of what is right and wrong is not our fault . 
   it 's the morality of the act and the people making it . 
  whose morality ? 
  yours ? 
  french ? 
  so you want to end fishing ? 
  you dont eat cod , halibut , herring ? 
  and what is so holy about minke whale that you want to kill cows instead ? 
  ffs , do you oppose modern society ? 
  how do you think we went from eating berries and shitting in the bushes to arguing with morons on the internet ? 
  by controlling the ecosystem , and if we are going to harvest from the fish resources we have to keep the predators in balans . 
  norway never signed the iwc treaty . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_convention_for_the_regulation_of_whaling  although norway is a party to the convention , it maintains an objection to paragraph 10 ( e ) of the convention ( the section referring to the 1986 moratorium ) . 
  therefore , that provision is not binding upon norway and the 1986 iwc global moratorium does not apply to it . 
   just , why ? 
  because the sea is an ecosystem , and as long as we are going to chatch fish we need to keep the apex predators in check . 
  minke whales in the barent sea eat as much fish a year as the norwegian fishing fleet catches , and they do not follow any quotas as us humans . 
  in the long run that will be a problem . 
  and the meat is delicious . 
   most intelligent and complex mammals in the world minke whale ? 
  do you have a source on that ? 
   murdering whales does n't serve any purpose because norwegians have plenty of food sources . 
  much like in portugal or spain bullfighting should be outlawed because the animal suffers enormously , norway should outlaw whale hunting . 
  the minke whales in the barent sea eat as much fish as the norwegian fishing fleet catches each year . 
  i hope at least some portuguese understand the significance of that . 
  what kind of spruce ? 
  first i laughed and upvoted , then i remembered that danish and norwegian writen is more or less identical . 
  and that is good for the world , and good for estonia . 
  i know , but a swede joke has to be about something they are worse then us in . 
  or a joke that underlines the stupidity of swedes :d https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/uefa_euro_2016_qualifying_group_e mhm what am i looking for ? 
  you can not explain away estonia and poland with germany produces more total , germany has the second biggest population in europa , of course it would be the biggest polluter . 
  estonia has the dirtiest electricity consumption in europe . 
  norway did not qualify , so it would be kind of useless joke :d, 
  never heard about `` per capita '' ? 
  savage norway should hire you to write swede jokes . 
  and northern scandinavia . 
  poor iceland - sincerely half of norway . 
   you got santa , aurora borealis is northern norway 's . 
  that is just downhill skiing ? 
  i do not understand german so i 'm not exactly sure what im looking at , but is it something like when norwegians look at the total medal count from the winter olympics and take a nationalistic jerk off session ? 
  all of them ? 
  dude chill , it was enough with one mad man from austria . 
  so not a settlement . 
   alert , in the qikiqtaaluk region , nunavut , canada , is the northernmost ** permanently ** inhabited place in the world , at latitude 82 \u00b0 30 ' 05 '' north , 817 kilometres ( 508 mi ) from the north pole . 
  its permanent population was reported as ** zero ** in the 2011 census . 
  how exactly does this work ? 
  or is it just one more case of inconsistency in the english language ? 
  the biggest reason is that norway has not experienced the level of centralization as our neighbouring countries and the population in the countryside that is very negative to the eu , has still enough political power to block any talks about joining eu . 
   what you are saying is like saying sweden was the leader of the union because the paper was written in kalmar . 
  i did not say that norway was the leader , i said that denmark did not conquer norway or sweden , it was a political union . 
  all that potential and what did denmark do ? 
  fuck all . 
  im not sure , it 's more then just the fisheries laws that keep norway outside the union . 
  we can afford for the time to stay outside , who knows in the future . 
   i mean , that necessitates that we won wars in the first place . 
  there 's a reason the kalmar union was united under denmark . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalmar_union  the union was the work of scandinavian aristocracy wishing to counter the influence of the hanseatic league . 
  margaret ( 1353 -- 1412 ) , a daughter of king valdemar iv of denmark , ** married king haakon vi of norway and sweden , who was the son of king magnus iv of sweden , norway and scania . 
  ** margaret succeeded in having her son olav recognized as heir to the throne of denmark . 
  in 1376 ** olav ** inherited the crown of denmark from his maternal grandfather as king oluf iii , with his mother as guardian ; when haakon vi died in 1380 , olaf also inherited the crown of norway . 
  the two kingdoms were united in a personal union under a child king , with the king 's mother as his guardian ; later , olav had designs on the throne of sweden ( in opposition to albert of mecklenburg ) from 1385 until 1387 . 
  it was a union , denmark did not conquer shit !, 
  all you did was lose parts of norway the following centuries , because you suck . 
  look at this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fishing_industry_by_country norway catches 2,8 times more than the closest eu nation spain , so why join a union where spain could get leverage over us ? 
  ** we ** have the best regulations and policies , why risk them ? 
  they are not sustainable . 
  [ common fisheries policy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_fisheries_policy )  the first rules were created in 1970 . 
  the original six common market members realised that four countries applying to join the common market at that time ( britain , ireland , denmark including greenland , and norway ) would control the richest fishing grounds in the world . 
  the original six therefore drew up council regulation 2141/70 giving all members equal access to all fishing waters , even though the treaty of rome gave no authority to do this . 
  this was adopted on the morning of 30 june 1970 , a few hours before the applications to join were officially received . 
  this ensured that the regulations became part of the acquis communautaire before the new members joined , obliging them to accept the regulation . 
  in its accession negotiations , the uk at first refused to accept the rules but by the end of 1971 the uk gave way and signed the accession treaty on 22 january 1972 , thereby bringing into the cfp joint management an estimated four fifths of all the fish off western europe [ citation needed ] . 
  norway decided not to join . 
  greenland left the ec in 1985 , after having gained partial independence from denmark in 1979 . 
   when the fisheries policy was originally set up the intention was to create a free trade area in fish and fish products with common rules . 
  it was agreed that fishermen from any state should have access to all waters . 
  an exception was made for the coastal strip , which was reserved for local fishermen who had traditionally fished those areas . 
  a policy was created to assist modernisation of fishing vessels and on-shore installations . 
  do you think we are some kind of altruistic bunch of idiots ? 
  eu tries to fuck us over and we said no thanks . 
  total control of our exclusive economic zone . 
  and the fact that eu has no fucking clue about sustainable fishery . 
  one example is the ban on discarding fish , it was introduced in norwegian fisheries legislation in 1987 . 
  eu is still debating it 30 years later . 
  common fisheries policy is a ** big ** no no in norway 's case .
