  so why the fuck has germany , the biggest economy in europe not done any research on thorium reactors since the 1980 ? 
  and what is the point of energiewende when you build coal plants ????????? 
  this makes no sense , instead of a concentrated waste product that can be stored to a time we maybe find a use for it , people want it released right out in the environment where they live ? 
  how fucking stupid could people be ? 
  you do know that coal plants release radioactive material ? 
  so germany going full [ retard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_power_phase-out#germany ) is bad for the environment ? 
  who would have known ? 
  tell that to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries , they did n't get the memo . 
  -2 nd place is just first among losers, 
  after watching spaniards/catalans parking in barcelona , i will not believe anything is `` physically impossible '' . 
  has been talks about a movie , but a hbo series would have been much cooler . 
  maybe an idea for something to do after got ? 
   sucks they both failed to become kings/emperors harald hardrada was king of norway for 20 years . 
  he unsuccessfully claimed both the danish and english throne . 
  he has probebly lived one if not the most interesting life in norwegian history . 
  that is what we used to call the sami in norway . 
  ( still in use in parts of northern norway , usually in a pejorative term like : j\u00e6vla fjellfinn ) the finnic people is kalled [ kven ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kven_people ) in norway . 
   legend i mentioned is shitty as legends go , but it was popular her in the south east . 
  that girl 's name was oslava . 
  people from oslo will surely appreciate that the place is popular at least somewere , 
  the normans did not serve in the imperial guard , the normans fought against the varangian guard . 
  so everything in your story/legend is just wrong . 
  i 'm not trying to be a dick , just give you some interesting reading material . 
  and the normans in this time period is about 3-4 generations removed from its scandinavian roots . 
  that we have greek influence in norway is not that strange , greek - norwegian contact goes back a long time : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pytheas#discovery_of_thule, 
  hehehehe awesome accent on the voice actors . 
  and i 'm well aware about the creepiness of groke/hufsa . 
  moomin was a part of my childhood to , 
  nope , you have some reading to do [ byzantine -- norman wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine%e2%80%93norman_wars ) [ harald hardrada in byzantine service ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harald_hardrada#in_byzantine_service ) [ oslo toponymy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oslo#general_information ), 
  i have no idea , that is buskerud named after a farm with the norse name  biskupsru\u00f0 --  bishop clearance ( super edit : bishop is a greek loanword ) i do n't understand why finnmark is marked as germanic / finno-ugric , it literally means sami march or sami borderland , it 's purely a germanic name .

   in certain countries like finland and sweden , several episodes from the combined list of 104 episodes have been left un-aired . 
  in finland , episodes `` the pirate '' , `` the imp '' and `` the birthday surprise '' were banned due to being too terrifying and `` un-moomin-like '' , according to the director of the finnish dub , jertta ratia-k\u00e4h\u00f6nen , while in sweden the episode `` the big explosion '' has n't been aired . 
  in norway , `` the witch '' , `` the spell '' and `` the imp '' were aired once and then were taken off , because they were thought to be too scary for the youngest in the audience . 
  similarly , after `` tiny guests '' first aired there , parents called in to nrk , complaining that the groke was too scary and after the series was taken off for some time , she was re-dubbed in later episodes with a lighter voice . 
  [ citation needed ] `` the big explosion '' was n't aired there , but it was later released on dvd , due to changed minds on the scariness factor . 
  all 78 episodes from the first series have been shown on children 's bbc in the united kingdom , but the sequel series has been completely left out . 
  got ta love the nordic countries , 
  [ just have a look ] ( https://www.norgeibilder.no/ ) [ hardangervidda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hardangervidda ), 
  yeah , no . 
  the spanish sailors did not pay membership fee to the national insurance because they were excluded from membership by law and was not able to become a member . 
  that is the reason they do not have a claim on pension from norway . 
   ** did not pay payroll taxes . 
  before the eea agreement entered into force in 1994 there were only norwegian nationals and persons permanently residing in norway who could receive pension benefits in the pension insurance for seamen and the national insurance scheme . 
  the rules meant that shipowners did not pay payroll taxes for other than nordic citizens and by a separate agreement with the portuguese . 
  **  ** that the spanish seamen had to pay taxes , yet not earn pension rights , is a consequence of the regulations in force at the time , says communications director of the norwegian shipowners association , erik giercksky . 
  [ we also helped in a way ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_crusade )  after several months they came to the town of santiago de compostela ( jakobsland ) [ 3 ] in galicia ( galizuland ) where they were allowed by a local lord to stay for the winter . 
  however , when the winter came there was a shortage of food , which caused the lord to refuse to sell food and goods to the norwegians . 
  sigurd then gathered his army , attacked the lord 's castle and looted what they could there . 
   during the journey , the norwegians encountered a great pirate fleet of galleys which were seeking peaceful trading ships to rob . 
  however , sigurd set his course straight for the pirates and stormed their ships . 
  after a short time all the pirates had been either slain or escaped , and sigurd acquired eight ships from them . 
   after this they came to a castle in muslim al-andalus called sintra ( sintre - present day sintra , portugal , probably referring to colares , which is closer to the sea ) . 
  they took the castle , and killed every man there , as they had refused to be christened . 
  they then sailed to lisbon , a `` half christian and half heathen '' city , said to be on the dividing line between christian and muslim iberia . 
  there they won their third battle , and acquired great treasures . 
   their fourth battle was won in the town of alkasse ( possibly a reference to al qa\u015fr ) , [ 3 ] where they killed such a large number of people , the town was said to have been left empty . 
  here , they looted many treasures , 
  it was founded as sankt olofsborg by a indo-european barbarian , 
  named after a norwegian king/saint .

  fuck , is it purge day ? 
  i formally claim greenland , iceland , orkney and shetland , bohusland , jemtland and herjedalen , and last but not least faroe island for the glorious kingdom of norway !, 
  finland use the nordic model , estonia does not . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  it 's a bigger numerical difference between norway and netherlands then between netherlands - switzerland , switzerland - australia and so on . 
  god damn it 's awesome being norwegian . 
  thank you north-denmark . 
  you dont know `` the man who broke the bank of england '' ? 
  in a country with infinite resources then i might support you , but like everything else health care is a place where you have to prioritize . 
  i believe that if you have to choose between cancer drugs to young patients or operasjon on a 90 year old we should choose cancer drugs . 
  [ yes ] ( https://youtu.be/apxlid0d584 ), 
  some pasta with the fish balls in white sauce is never wrong, 
   i know of a case where a 90 year old lady was sent home the same day after surgery and died the same night . 
  and that is something i do n't understand , why do we perform surgery on a 90 year old person ? 
  why ca n't we accept that 90 years is a reasonable age to die ? 
  save some of that salt for the pasta . 
  do you even know what nordic means ? 
  it 's not something you just can declare yourself part of . 
  but the decision by the un does not mention nordic , or do you think ireland and uk is nordic ? 
  keep on aiming for the stars . 
  [ battle of clontarf ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_clontarf ) :( god damn irish !, 
  nope , that was skei grande . 
  just as fat , but a lot less relevant in norwegian politics . 
   i just picked them cause they 're so far away from us nordic folks . 
  :p take a trip to the norwegian coast and you will see that it 's not `` that '' far away . 
  lots of portuguese and spanish sailors got lucky in norway . 
   i honestly feel no close to a guy from portugal than to a guy from canada for example . 
  the portuguese like cod , so they are decent people . 
   would consider it an insult to be called european why ? 
  ok , thanks for the explanation .
