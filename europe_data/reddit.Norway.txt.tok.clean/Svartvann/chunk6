  northern norwegian/nordlending/h \u00e5l\u00f8yger 5 . 
  norwegian 6 . 
  scandinavien 7 . 
  nordic and then european . 
  i do n't understand how any of my base identities will stop me from being european ? 
  i 'm not even a eu citizen and from one of the areas farthest from `` core europe '' but i 'm still european . 
  it would be interesting to read the reason why someone do n't feel european . 
  i read your link and it makes no sense , is europe = eu in the uk ? 
   none of this applies to any other country in europe , even norway , which is on the edge of europe does n't have anything like the anglosphere , the continent has always been its centre of attention . 
   so yeah , britain is pretty different from the continent , our identity is not strongly tied to the continent as yours is . 
  i have worked quite a lot over the years both in the uk and the netherlands ( i work on offshore vessel 's ) , and the similarities between the countries are as big , as everything else i have seen in europe between countries . 
  ( the work ethic , the ridiculous houses , the food , the pubs , etc. ), 
  :p how to look lika a fool , a norwegian adventure . 
  but what the hell , it 's my second language and i have dyslexia , mistakes will be made . 
  i 'm just saying that the special snowflake thing you got going on the ( trigger warning for the irish ) ** british isles ** get old really quick . 
  and ? 
  you have the channel tunnel . 
  is water a magical divide that makes uk special ? 
   it 's got a land border with two other european countries for a start . 
  til russia is not european . 
   i think this is what many continentals do n't understand . 
  you stand on a beach on the south coast and look out to see , and despite it only being 25 or so miles to france you might as well be on the west coast looking towards america for all the good it 'll do you . 
   that has a psychological impact on the national zeitgeist . 
  how is that any different than other european countries ? 
  do you think norway is more part of the continent than uk ? 
  talk about snowflakes . 
  we are building [ ryfast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ryfast ) in the same area, 
   at least we are better than estonia . 
  do n't let your dreams be dreams . 
  the swedes are out in force . 
  thank you . 
  that ca n't be right , what 's your source ? 
  have to ask , what 's up with your nickname ? 
  are you an exiled norwegian ? 
  [ european super grid ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_super_grid ), 
  thank you , was a very interesting read . 
  how will the situation change when the new nuclear power plant is up and running ? 
  so you get a pass because you use all your oil domestic ? 
  how is that symbolic ? 
  estonia and poland has by far the worst impact in electricity production in europe . 
  all your power is produced a stone throw away from the border with russia . 
  how the hell is that energy independence ? 
  russia could fuck you over with one rocket . 
  still does not change the fact that he is wrong . 
   norway is also the world 's third largest natural gas exporter ( twice as much as us , not in per capita terms but absolute terms ) . 
  and that is one of the reasons germany 's electricity is not more dirty . 
  how is that possible ? 
  http://www.energinet.dk/en/el/sider/det-nordiske-elsystem.aspx this source says that they produce and consumes all domestically . 
  because it 's one of the easiest co2 cut we could make in europe , and if we are serious about climate change eu has to step the fuck up and do something about it . 
  i want a source on your claim that 50 % of norwegian goverment revenue is from oil export and oil fund . 
  her is something to start with : [ statsbudsjettet 2017 ] ( http://www.statsbudsjettet.no/statsbudsjettet-2017/ ), 
  because ash storage and co2 is not correctly estimated . 
  it is far to cheap too pollute . 
   norway gets 50 % of its government revenue from oil exports what ? 
  that is not true . 
  [ goverment revenue ] ( http://www.norskpetroleum.no/en/economy/governments-revenues/ ), 
   1 , your plan requires infrastructure , and that is something eu have to fix . 
  estonian consumption is so low that you could import all your electricity from the nordic power system and it would have a negligible change on the price level . 
  but if the eu is serious about climate change , certainly making estonian energy cleaner is more important then railway stations in hungary ? 
  how exactly ? 
  your energy is as expansive as our but just a lot more dirty . 
  with a cable from finland you could use energy from the nordic countries as base load and local wind and solar power when that is cheaper . 
  it clearly says price per mwh, 
  does not change the fact that you pay the same for the electricity . 
  as my link show , you pay the same for the electricity as us in the nordic countries . 
  if we raise co2 taxes the incentive to import clean energy would be better . 
  [ det nordiske elsystem ] ( http://www.energinet.dk/en/el/sider/det-nordiske-elsystem.aspx ) it is clear that co2 tax must be increased . 
  why not use some of the billions norway pays to the eu to make estonia less dependent on dirty energy ? 
  which is pretty retarded when they could have imported cheap electricity from the nordic countries . 
  estonia : no fucks given, 
  what ? 
  so you say that you had a headstart but still manage to fuck up ? 
  :d nice, 
  you are absolutely right , bad history by me . 
  it 's a complicated part of history , and very fascinating . 
  you are the one that are doing hyperbole , i 'm just calling you out on it . 
  half the world ? 
  germany did not even invade half of europe . 
  your finnished with this discussion ? 
  :d so they get a pass because it did not end up in a world war ? 
  you know uk was planning to invade norway and sweden to support finland ( mostly to take over narvik and kiruna ) but it would have led to a war between uk and the soviets . 
   germans started the war . 
  i love how the soviet invasion of finland is just forgotten . 
  nope , the polish-lithuanian commonwealth called in the teutonic order to crusade against the old prussians . 
  but the polish-lithuanian commonwealth thought they were going to take over the lands after the teutonic order was done killing and converting . 
  the teutonic order had another idea . 
  nope , they took it from the old prussians . 
  norway is on top !, 
  suck it sweden !, 
  you are certainly working hard to make it true . 
  eu = europe is still wrong . 
  ** european-related ** content as in relevant to europe . 
  this is france local news, 
  i have not claimed that french guinea is not part of france , im saying that it is not a part of europe . 
  and i have noticed that people on this sub are trying to change the definition of europe . 
  where eu = europe, 
  i have no idea of what you are talking about . 
  you mean bouvet island ? 
  and it is also not a part of europe . 
  i think it 's more the famous swedish retardness you witnessed .
