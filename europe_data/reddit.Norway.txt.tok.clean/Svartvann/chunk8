   if you live on welfare like me then it 's really hard to find cheap apartments near the city why live near the city if you are on welfare ? 
  it 's not like you need to commute into the city . 
   can you name some big polish companies you have seen in norway ? 
  seen a fuckload of polish workers making money in the construction industry . 
  what exactly did you expect when you joined the eu ? 
  it 's the only reason you 're not as dirt poor as belarus or ukraine . 
  denmark is the sediments from norway , when the icebergs carved our beautiful fjords and rounded the mountains , it created a habitat for the half humans you know as danes . 
   we are only left with jobs . 
  poor you . 
  a regular ice car . 
  we are more important :p, 
  i 'm not sure what this map is trying to convey , it arbitrarily cut norway in half . 
   he will pay the same for a car do you know the cost of a car in norway ? 
   africans will turn italians , as they always do . 
  people are made by culture , and the italian culture is very convincing . 
  so what is the difference between a north and south italian ? 
  if the africans turns into south italians , you have a big problem . 
   norway is full of ubermensches . 
  yes, 
  is this not a job for the un ? 
   or that super creepy ** drunk ** uncle who goes on and on how beautiful young women you 've become with your sisters . 
  and since it 's finland , we know it 's a personal true story . 
  could they not use some of the $ 13bn tax on apple they collected ? 
  thought we all agreed that sweden was public enemy no . 
   too busy being a danish clone not sure if it 's an insult or flattery . 
   if anyone is wondering . 
  no :d, 
  we could remove the letters : c , z , q , w , x from the norwegian alphabet , since they are never used . 
  then we 're back to 24 letters , 
  \u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00d8\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5, 
   ( only 32 redditors have chosen the sami flair , btw ) . 
  it 's only 60,000 - 110,000 sami in europe so that 's not strange . 
   countries and 1st level admin regions seems the best place to draw the line to satisfy the most redditors europe has so few indigenous people , that to accommodate them is peanuts . 
   it would be an injustice to every other region to keep the sami flag . 
  how so ? 
  the sami is a [ indigenous people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indigenous_peoples#europe ) in europe and as such deserves special treatment . 
   user flairs that use flags of ethnical groups ( e.g. 
  ** sami ** , roma ) will be removed . 
  the sami flag is a official flag in [ norway ] ( https://lovdata.no/forskrift/2004-05-27-1087 ) , and even if the sami do n't have a country , they are still a nation . 
  it would be a great injustice to remove the sami flag !, 
  furthermore they are one of few ethnical groups classified as a [ indigenous people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indigenous_peoples#europe ) in europe by the un [ declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaration_on_the_rights_of_indigenous_peoples ) . 
  so everyone is happy ? 
   any discussion done by the council . 
  this touches everything the eu is allowed to do , i.e. 
  you tell the eu what it does and how to do it . 
  the commission is the exceutive , after all . 
  and again , why should this be in our interest ? 
  we have access to the common marked , something we care about and pay close to nothing in comparison to neighbouring countries . 
  we are not part of the common fishery policy , something we also care about . 
  we have our own currency that helped us immensely during the crisis we have now , and we are not part of the common agricultural policy . 
  the way i see it , we have access to the parts of eu we want , and do n't have to pay for the things we do n't need . 
  the best of both worlds . 
   you tell me - what can norway do to influence eu legislation ? 
  discuss it with our fellow nordic neighbours . 
  on what issue would a membership have helped norway ? 
   a tiny voice ? 
  every country has the same voice in the council , where the ** important decisions are made . 
  ** such as ? 
  what important decisions ? 
   because being influential is useful ? 
  and norway is not influential ? 
  or do you need a tiny voice in eu to be seen as influential ? 
   norway has less of a voice in eu matters than what it would have as a member state so ? 
  we are not a memberstate , why should we care ? 
   yet needs to agree to plenty of measures it can not influence as readily if it wishes to retain its special access to the single market . 
  that is why we have efta and our trojan horses ( denmark , finland and sweden ), 
   we are n't butting right up against a bunch of countries where other languages are spoken . 
  mexico ? 
  most of south america ? 
  it 's the importers job to reduce reliance on oil products . 
  if norway stop exporting , another country would just take over our market . 
  not the norwegian consumer . 
  we would get german energy prices and we would be in the hands of germany and it 's retarded energy policies . 
  because swedes are wimps . 
  to be fair , the whole idiom gives no meaning , and it 's hard to translate it accurately . 
  but the norwegian version is `` ugler i mosen '' and that is owls in the moss . 
  moss can be in the bog but also in the forest . 
   if these people wo n't police themselves or their ideas , we 'll have to do it for them . 
  it 's 2017 , you ca n't have such stone age opinions with impunity . 
  sure it 's not 1984 ? 
  that would be `` ugler i myra '' and that is just ridiculous :d btw if you google `` owls in the bog '' you get `` swedish sayings '' . 
  we take nordland , jemtland , herjedalen and bohusland . 
  denmark can have the rest . 
  ugler i mosen = owls in the moss = something is suspicious skippertak = captains pull = short and intense effort, 
  rockall is a rock and as such do n't have a ezz . 
   while russians saw that you are messing with not only eu fishers but your own as easy way to move in and start over fishing the area because they have just as legal claim to it as norway . 
  norway and russia has solved our differences and borders in the north . 
  maybe they will be a problem in the future , but right now the biggest problem is eu . 
  this judgment applies to all of you . 
  not much fish to catch inside the 12 mile limit . 
  https://www.abcnyheter.no/nyheter/politikk/2017/07/01/195314449/smutthullet-dom-gir-norge-mer-kontroll fast and dirty translate by google  the verdict is the first of its kind , confirming that norway can determine the rules and that the coast guard can enforce them in the [ smutthullet ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/smutthullet ) . 
  the water column in smutthullet is still an international sea area , but the bottom is divided between norway and russia , with the un 's blessing , writes nrk . 
  - this is a very important judgment . 
  with this we have control over norway 's part of the continental shelf in smutthullet again , says fause , who was the prosecutor of the case , to the canal . 
  it was in july last year that the lithuanian fishing boat was arrested for illegal snowmen in the barents sea . 
  the shipping company was given a fine of 2.5 million kroner , the approximate value of the snowman they had fished in smutthullet . 
  the skipper received a fine of 15,000 kroner . 
  when the skipper and the shipping company refused to pay , the case went to court . 
  in east finnmark district court they were acquitted , but when the case was appealed to the court of appeal this month , the verdict was lifted . 
  `` norway has won international rights over a large ocean area , and there are probably billion values that can be caught on the bottom in the form of a snow crab and king crab , '' says fause .
