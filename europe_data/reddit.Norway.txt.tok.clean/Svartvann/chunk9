  norway forbade catch of snow crab in smutthullet in 2014 . 
   you still have to share the fish no , we do n't need to share . 
  we can trade quotas , but eu countries has no rights to fish in our waters . 
  the worst thing about the matter is that the european union is not part of the svalbard treaty and has no right to distribute quotas . 
  damn , i 'm on a slow as hell internet connection at sea , and posted the same response like 10 times . 
  i deleted but you replied to quick . 
  we will see , if eu thinks norway is a pushover then they are going to get a nasty surprise . 
  smart enough to not waste 5 years of our life with people we do n't like . 
   scandinavia is not socialist what gave it away ? 
  payed approximately 85 euro for 50 liters last time i filled the tank on the car . 
  europe ? 
  europe ??? 
  just no !, 
  this shows eu . 
  great post i 'll give you that . 
   we would win eurovision a lot of times because , well , sweden . 
  sweden wins because of 48 easy points from the other nordic nations . 
  to be fair that is a simple calculation when you use metric :d, 
   can the benelux join ? 
  fuck no !, 
   would love to be in a union made up of so many great nations . 
  benelux is also made up of great nations ( is belgium a nation ? ), 
  but you are very different from the nordic nations . 
   just as bad with europeans , who for some reason dream of a united ireland . 
  it pisses off the british , and everyone loves that , 
   that 's because media is owned by influential people , just like the fishing industry . 
  without the fishing industry being against , ** 70 % of the population would be positive . 
  ** why ? 
  what do eu have to offer norway ? 
   every norwegian pays about $ 170 euro per year to the eu budget . 
  and that is fuck all compared to what we have to pay as a member . 
   do you agree with me that if norway and iceland would 've gotten an exemption on the fishery rules , they would both be eu members now ? 
  that was my point initially . 
  i 'm not sure , 70 % of the population of norway is negative to eu membership . 
  it 's more than just common fishery policy . 
  eu is looked at as a cumbersome and inefficient organisation . 
  why should we join ? 
  to pay for ee countries that gives us the middle finger when they have to contribute ? 
  pluss [ this ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/of-crustaceans-and-oil-the-case-of-the-snow-crab-on-svalbard/ ) does not help . 
   fair enough , pretty related though . 
  you have quotas and want to keep those for your own trawlers . 
  yes , it 's hard enough keeping our own fishing companies in check , do not need companies that are even worse . 
  nope , not even remotely on point . 
  the quota system is okay and if you knew about european fishing you will know that norway and iceland has a much better system then the eu . 
  the free for all is not okay . 
  we do not want super trawlers from netherland and other eu nations trawling our eez . 
   the norwegian wet dream to finally take revenge on those pesky swedes and danes . 
  damn , i thought it was a secret . 
  we have faith in you !, 
  it 's chicken or the egg situation , do you build the bicycle roads and attract cyclist or do you wait to you reach a critical mass of bicyclist on the road before you build bicycle lanes ? 
  forget the center of the universe ? 
  are you high on maple syrup ? 
  we are part of the schengen agreement . 
  [ polen ] ( https://www.ssb.no/en/innvandring-og-innvandrere/nokkeltall ) but the numbers do n't tell the whole story , the poles and eastern europeans settles where there are a need of people to fill vacancies . 
  mena and sub-sahara africans settles in the cities after the required stay at asylum centers out in the provinces . 
  we have a growing problem with self segregation in the cities with the problems that follow . 
   norway 's frickin massive for its tiny population , i do n't see much changing soon right ? 
  it 's the people that make the nation , not the land areal . 
  the growth shown is not the result of norwegians procreating . 
  03:47 cet : damn i want a downvote and upvote count on the posts . 
  this has gone from 18 pluss to 8 to 12 in the space of 1 minute . 
  03:49 cet : 12 - 8 - 10 - 9 in the space of 2 minutes . 
  hehehehe nice one , it 's about now im going to tell you my mom is dead and watch you getting embarrassed over something you had no possible way of knowing :d but i 'm fairly sure he meant the size off the norwegian mountain runoffs you call denmark . 
  hehehehehehehehehe awesome burn !, 
  norway is going to be a different place then what we knew . 
  no , only estonia , latvia and lithuania . 
  finland , sweden and denmark is nordic countries . 
  sweden and denmark is also scandinavian countries . 
  yes it 's shit , but it is close to impossible to find a study on drinking water . 
  but i have worked 8 months in the netherlands and i can promise you on my worthless anecdote that the water is faaaaaaar from `` best in the world '', 
   best drinking water you can get in the world [ not even top 19 :d ] ( https://www.triphobo.com/blog/countries-serving-cleanest-of-tap-water ) are you going all [ american ] ( http://www.n-r-c.com/the-worlds-best-tasting-water/ ) on us ? 
  [  ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=struthio+camelus&amp;client=ms-android-huawei&amp;prmd=ivsn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjdg-mi_dduahusejokhv20b6kq_auicsgb&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=560 ), 
   and so optimistic people ( like northern ) what ? 
  we bitch and moan all the time . 
  the cultural divide between us is too big to handle :(, 
  super thanks !, 
  i dont known why , but ola sounds like a hillbilly from bumfuckistan . 
  ole is like a fancy version of the name . 
  they were assholes everywhere they went , not sure how denmark-norway survived . 
  they wrecked both poland and germany . 
  we go for the middle ground and agree on norway , 
  fake news !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  swede : character - gruesome sounds about right, 
   some countries , especially nordic countries , ** do as well ** as the netherlands https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eoahdwgbvu, 
   dog 100kr for en fad\u00f8l ?!, 
   most things that where state run in denmark like dsb and post denmark were really bad then but are much worse now ... 
  it 's the same in norway , the hybrid state-private run company shit we have now is not working . 
   k\u00f8benhavnere do have a reputation for arrogance in denmark , but i do n't feel like that 's the problem with post nord . 
  it 's just run by morons . 
  that is also a plausible explanation :d, 
  when i lived in northern norway i could excuse posten norge for being slow because of distance . 
  stavanger - oslo is not that far , i think it 's just malice . 
  if it 's copenhagen , stockholm or oslo they all share a `` got mine , fuck the rest of you '', 
  that 's just the curse of having a system where everything needs to make a round into a capital that is not central in relation to the land area . 
  my theory is that it 's the easterlings way of showing the rest of us the middle finger . 
  have both , equally slow . 
   i have few complaints at all and i use the mail service extensively . 
  do you live in eastern norway ? 
  posten norge sucks donkey balls also . 
  over 1 week to send something from kristiansand to stavanger .
