  pointing to underlying causes does not mean doubting their claimed motivations . 
  it 's not about what their motivations are , but why those are their motivations . 
  what are the circumstances that push a person in one direction or another ? 
  we know it 's not islam . 
  if that were the case , it 'd be pretty obvious . 
  there 's plenty of moderate , secular , and liberal muslim-majority countries . 
  the vast majority of muslims , be they conservative , moderate , or liberal , do n't engage in or support terrorism . 
  just like people join cults and religions ( but i repeat myself ) and genuinely believe , many people are also attracted to extremist islam . 
  it really is just the ideology that 's in vogue right now . 
  man , you guys are really grasping at straws . 
  the only islamic involvement in the northern mali conflict was by external terrorist groups . 
  [ read more here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4bw2qd/islamic_state_video_calls_for_jihad_after/d1dbh6n?context=3 ) the tajikistan civil war ended 20 fucking years ago . 
  the tunisian defusing of the political crisis is an example of people stepping away from islamist extremism . 
  uhhh , are you sure you know what you 're talking about ? 
  you seem to be conflating a lot of different events . 
  the mnla fought for an independent tuareg homeland in northern mali . 
  they rebelled , and due to the sitting government 's ineffectiveness in combating the rebellion , the malian military instigated a coup d'etat . 
  then a bunch of islamist terrorist organizations swooped in on the back of the rebellion and established an oppressive regime of terror in northern mali , where they instituted sharia law . 
  the mnla did not institute sharia law . 
  they started fighting against these islamist groups . 
  none of these groups at any point overthrew the government or participated in a coup . 
  that was the malian military . 
  sharia law was imposed on parts of northern mali by external terrorist organizations . 
  yes , mali was also a victim of terrorism . 
  that does not mean mali and its citizens are n't secular . 
   in other parts of indonesia , religious courts have jurisdiction over civil cases between muslim spouses on matters concerning marriage , divorce , reconciliation , and alimony . 
  it 's important to note which parts of sharia law are implemented . 
  jews have pretty similar civil law systems in place . 
  indonesia still has a lot longer to go , but islamism has been steadily reducing since its independence in the mid-20th century . 
  and i ca n't remember saying that sharia law was restricted to arab countries . 
  i said islamic extremism ( you know , isis ) pretty much was . 
  it 's just not that simple . 
  first of all , if iran is a state sponsor of terrorism , then the us and europe is , as well . 
  they 're not financing suicide bombers heading to europe or anything , they support organizations that further their interests in the region . 
  secondly , the gulf states do n't really have a strong central government as much as they have a lot of wealth consolidated in individuals . 
  these individuals provide funding , and qatar is kind of a switzerland of the middle east , which is why a lot of funding comes from them . 
  the saudi regime is propped up by salafist tribes who pretty much control the country . 
  they also have no shortage of wealthy individuals who fund terrorism . 
  that is not to say that a strong centralized state could not support terrorism , but that it is the exception rather than the norm . 
  so , you 're saying that people 's words speak louder than their actions ? 
  also , only 20 % of the muslim population lives in the middle east . 
  many of the countries i 'm listing may be `` small '' , but combined they far outweigh the me arab population . 
  it 's not the waves of immigrants that are the issue , it 's how we have no common plan for how to handle those waves . 
  that has been the issue from the start . 
  except senegal , and tunisia , and mali , and azerbaijan , and tajikistan , and kyrgyzstan , and guinea , and all the other secular muslim-majority countries that do n't give a fuck about instituting sharia , or dar al-islam , or support terrorism , and so on . 
  the islamic extremist issue is pretty much entirely an arab issue in the countries where weak central authorities caused by decades of destabilization by external forces allow radical groups to seize power . 
  and i 'm sure someone is going to post polls about how 5000 % of muslims want sharia law and all that bull , but if you look at the actions of those very people , they tell a different story . 
  take indonesia , the largest muslim-majority country in the world . 
  despite polls saying 72 % support sharia law being the law of the land , all islamist parties ( not all of which even support instating sharia law or an islamic state ) combined get only 25 % of the voting share , and that share has been steadily decreasing . 
  i 'm pretty sure that both muslim extremists ( both foreign , immigrant , and citizen ) and the immigration situation are acknowledged by politicians ... 
  the problem is n't identifying the issue , the problem is finding a functional solution that a united europe can accept . 
  if you are not already politically involved , i suggest you do become involved . 
  it 's really easy to sit on the internetz and talk about all the incompetent politicians , but unless you 're involved in the process , you are extremely blind of all the ways in which things are being done , and all the real obstacles on the way to getting things done . 
  but a fractured europe is less able to respond to both internal and external threats . 
  muslim immigration has not been a failure , and whatever `` economic drain '' caused by `` economic migrants '' is nothing compared to the immense economic impact of open borders . 
  so you 're one of those headline-only guys , then ? 
  what exactly is it that you 're accusing politicians of not acknowledging ? 
  uhhhh , no . 
  just because one thing is true does not make every other thing true . 
  jesus , people need to calm the fuck down with all this fearmongering . 
  ehhh , it 's pretty accurate . 
  that is in fact the question i asked , yes . 
  i just have to ask , how is that the scariest part ? 
  it was a rhetorical question highlighting the absurdity of the action . 
  k. why ? 
  what are you even talking about , dude ? 
  \\* * country makes nice gesture . 
  * \\* / r/europe : `` you fucking shits . '', 
  mmmm , historical revisionism ... 
  and these are the two definitions that come before the one you quoted :  : a number that is greater than half of a total  : a number of votes that is more than half of the total number i mean , if you look up [ peruse ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peruse ) , it literally means two opposite things . 
  dictionaries reflect common use , not accurate or correct use . 
  a plurality . 
  a majority requires over 50 % . 
  there is just such a fundamental misconception of how economics works in your reply that i 'm not even sure where to start . 
  you do n't just go around fucking with the rate of inflation because you want to devalue the savings of florent from loudun . 
  i mean , if you 're expanding the scope of `` what government can do '' to the absurd , you can just as well say that they can order the police or military to forcibly confiscate the currency , or instruct the bank to transfer x amount to their fund for evildoing . 
  you ca n't affect the price of specifically bananas by adjusting the rate of inflation . 
  it 's a universal effect . 
  governments have far more effective means of ** influencing ** prices through subsidies and the like , so talking about fucking inflation as a means of price control is just absurd . 
  you have no clue what you 're talking about . 
  you ca n't buy gold in a cashless society ? 
  thankfully , we 're not storing refugees in barrels . 
  well , according to / r/europe , there 's about 2 billion refugees in europe right now , so 1 bad apple is n't really that big of a deal . 
   why would you make a post like this when you yourself are a muslim living in europe ? 
  hey , guys !, 
  hey , guys !, 
  this is a criminal activity !, 
  these people fleeing war and a dead-end existence for them and their children should just think about how their actions are ** criminal ** and sit down and accept their fate !, 
  why ca n't these people be well-behaved like us first-world-standard-of-living-people ? 
  i mean , if my future , and my children 's future , was at stake , that does n't mean i would start to bend and break laws to try to ensure a better future for me and my family . 
  no , the reason why these people ca n't behave is because they 're brown mooslems who want to make europe into eurabian europistan islamo-europa . 
  i think he 's talking about us , guys . 
  and the filthy slovenes . 
  as much as it pains me to say this , sweden is still really nice . 
  stop with the / r/panichistory . 
  the council of deputies is the internationally recognized government of libya . 
  they do not require the permission of the general national congress . 
   you got to be kidding me.you are actually blamming the right wingers for this?how can they be blammed when the majority of european goverments at the moment are left ? 
  no , a majority of european governments are not left-wing .
