  south africa exists , you know . 
   is the war of the roses or english civil war as much a part of idris elbas 's history as queen elizabeth 's ? 
  yes . 
  inasmuch as it 's not part of any of their histories . 
  it 's part of their country 's history . 
  it does n't matter how easy or difficult it is , the fact that it happens incontrovertibly means that they are not related . 
  and yes , many european immigrants actually assimilated into native american cultures . 
  showing precisely how poor your reasoning is . 
  i mean , this is all easily disproven by the fact that people everywhere have taken on the culture of native people . 
  yes , there is correlation simply by virtue of the fact that both ethnicities and cultures tend to emerge and stay in specific geographical areas . 
  however , they are n't really more related than that . 
  you 're trying to conflate ethnicity and culture . 
  they are not related . 
  and [ prio ] ( https://www.prio.org/research/group/?x=3 ) has found the exact opposite , concluding that culture and ethnicity has no effect on conflicts within society . 
  you are literally racist . 
  culture is shaped by the people who live there , and idris elba is no less english or european than queen elizabeth . 
  my point is that the narrative of refugees/migrants swarming europe in unstoppable waves , imposing their beliefs and cultures and not integrating , is largely manufactured by focusing on a few violent interactions and a few refugees/migrants with exaggerated ideas of life in europe . 
  there 's no migrant crisis in europe , only a crisis caused by the - often intentional - incompetent handling of the current migration situation , largely by right-wing and xenophobic governments , politicians , and organizations , to create a climate that is advantageous to their own political positions . 
  the idea that there is an `` other side '' of the issue that is worthy of any attention is nonsense . 
  or maybe you 're only hearing one side of the story ? 
  op 's comments is edgelord-progressive , though . 
  `` i 'm so progressive i do n't even see color or gender ! '', 
  more like `` pirate party supporters less likely to actually vote in elections . '',

  nobody 's expected to do anything , we just do n't care . 
  if christians had restrictive dietary rules that prevented them from eating halal food , then they would n't be expected to eat it . 
  democracy does not mean you get your way all the time . 
  i did n't say it was a problem . 
  i am arguing that it is a good . 
  a good that will come as a result of the impending ai/robotics revolution that is * fundamentally different from the industrial revolution * . 
  which is what everyone else was arguing against . 
  no , i 'm talking about parity between human and ai/robotic abilities . 
  human obsolescence . 
  what is it you do n't understand about the word ` parity ' ? 
  humans will become obsolete . 
  it is significantly different when you have parity between human and ai/robotic abilities . 
  a digger has to be ** operated ** . 
  that 's why you maintain labor demand , because the industry expands to meet demand , requiring ** more human operators ** . 
  but with ai/robotics , you do n't need human operators . 
  you have far superior ai/robotic operators . 
  whatever human presence remains in the production process is not there because it 's needed , but because of our desire to stay in control . 
  but that wo n't be anywhere near enough to keep billions employed . 
  neither should we try to . 
  emigration and population decline has been an issue for lithuania since the fall of the soviet union . 
  thinking that leaving the eu would somehow change that is just nonsense . 
  in fact , emigration has gone down almost to 2001 levels since peaking in 2010 , and immigration ( and notably repatriation ) has gone up in the same time span ^ [ [ 1 ] ( http://123.emn.lt/en/general-trends/migration-10-years-overview ) ] . 
  any lithuanians want to comment on this ? 
  i 've checked opinion polls , and the farmers/greens party seem to have been steadily increasing since the last election , so was this in any way anticipated ? 
  to what do you attribute this election result ? 
  what 's been going on in lithuania and lithuanian politics that you believe led to it ? 
  except it 's exactly the opposite . 
  a basic income frees the citizenry to involve themselves in politics , to pursue the things they want to do , to be free of economic stress , to do things that actually improve the human condition . 
  it takes the leverage away from the employers and puts it in the hands of the people . 
  it allows people to pursue education free from financial burden and the need for it to have `` relevance on the job market '' . 
  innovation does not come from having someone sit in an office 40 + hours a week . 
  innovation comes from giving people the time and ability to pursue it . 
  people do not create by coercion . 
  they create because they want to . 
  the introduction of a basic income would lead to the greatest cultural and technological explosion in all of humanity . 
  detail the mechanisms and effects that lead to basic income leaving `` the recipients without any democratic power over their economy and society '' . 
  it 's unavoidable . 
  what is the end-game you conceive of here ? 
  `` captains of industry '' producing tvs in china that nobody can afford to buy ? 
  private ownership of the means of production does not work in a world where ai/robotics has parity with humans . 
  when you reach something like 25-50 % unemployment it 's just the end of the road for capitalism if we do n't voluntarily change the course of our society and economy before that time . 
  you seem to be catching on now . 
  it 's not ridiculous . 
  it 's the unavoidable future . 
   the ai/robotics revolution replaces you . 
  increases in productivity lead to an increased need of labor , ** but that labor need is n't filled by people . 
  it 's filled by the ai/robotics that caused the productivity increase in the first place . 
  ** quoting the comment you just replied to . 
  basic income funds would necessarily have to come from increased taxation on production , so what you envision is pretty much impossible . 
  what we will see as the ai/robotics revolution progresses is an initial move to basic income/negative income tax , first to cover basic needs while employment provides additional income . 
  as the human labor force is replaced by robots/ai , basic income will become the main source of income for most people . 
  the world 's production output will change hands from private ownership to public ownership , and we will move into a post-scarcity economy/society that will radically transform every aspect of human life . 
  the timeline for this can be 50 years , it can be 100 years . 
  it all depends on the speed of progress within ai/robotics , which has exploded in that last 5 years . 
  the fundamental difference is that , unlike the industrial revolution where machines replaced human labor , the ai/robotics revolution will replace human capabilities . 
  in the industrial revolution , you had machines increase productivity . 
  this reduced prices and led to higher demand , which led to an increased demand for labor . 
  so , if a machine increased productivity by 10 and this led to an increase in demand by 10 , the workforce required to meet that demand did n't change . 
  the ai/robotics revolution replaces ** you ** . 
  increases in productivity lead to an increased need of labor , but that labor need is n't filled by people . 
  it 's filled by the ai/robotics that caused the productivity increase in the first place . 
  it has a mild ashy taste , with a hint of jew and a tinge of roma . 
  the flat geography of the netherlands and its cities is a very important reason for why it works so well there , so its adoption is n't as straight-forward everywhere . 
  climate and weather also has an impact . 
  ebikes is a solution here , though , and should be promoted more . 
  no , it is n't . 
  yelling fire in a crowded whatever and such . 
  as a reasonable human being i am able to recognize degrees of things . 
  i am able to differentiate a law criminalizing the denial of a genocide with a law criminalizing the criticism of a political party , and i am able to identify ahead of time if a government is moving in that direction . 
  while i am not convinced that these laws have any substantial positive effects , i am certain they have no negative effects . 
  there are no valuable discussions to be had on whether these events happened beyond fanning the flames of xenophobia , racism , and violence . 
  their texts allowing it to avoid persecution and death , you mean . 
  you know , muslims are equally as able to lie as anyone else . 
  first off , you 're assuming that they are universally applicable . 
  you do n't make plans for partition unless you have plans to invade .
