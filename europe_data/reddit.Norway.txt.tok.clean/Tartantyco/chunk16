   how i feel trumps your facts !, 
  i demand fair and balanced reporting on whether the holocaust happened . 
  obviously , they must be sentenced to death . 
  i doubt you 've even read a single page of the quran . 
  islam has been around for over a millennium , shit like this has n't really been happening until about a decade ago . 
  is the problem islam , or is it the political situation in the middle east and nearby countries ? 
  not always , but we have been sticking our fingers up pretty much every bumhole in the world for the last couple of centuries , so we 've got a lot of baggage . 
   it 's like they 've got more rights than us no , they just have the same rights as you ... 
  it does make a difference if people are trying to set islam apart from all other religions as promoting violence . 
  the claim is that all muslims are called to kill the infidels , which is simply not the case . 
  this is irrelevant to my statement . 
  plese do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i did n't deny that there is violence in the quran . 
  i said that it does n't say to kill all infidels . 
  of course , i 'm the one reading it with prejudice ... you are more than welcome to provide quotes to substantiate your claims . 
   islam , however , says to kill infidels and whatnot . 
  truly , the words of a scholar ... 
  the quran says nothing of the sort , i 'm afraid . 
  only quotes taken out of context say that . 
  welcome to / r/europe . 
  our longboats would rek u !, 
  the recent uptick in terrorist attacks is a result of the success in defeating is in the middle east . 
  they 're losing territory , soldiers , and leaders left and right , so they 've started pushing for more terrorist attacks . 
  this is their death throes . 
  this picture is from when it was being towed , i think . 
  they submerged the feet when it reached its position . 
  and individual polls can be outliers , which is why you aggregate results from many polls . 
  they all left to buy diapers at the norwegian border . 
  i 'd like to be described as a sexual adventurer . 
  yes . 
  it being advisory is a fact , not a matter of opinion . 
  the referendum is ** advisory ** . 
  democracy has nothing to do with it . 
  today i found out that there are stupid questions . 
  the specific amount does n't matter , it 's the proportion that matters . 
  in norway , 1 million is 20 % . 
  in china 1 million is 0,07 % . 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  i 'll let you think it through for a bit . 
  if a little less than 2 % more of the votes went remain , it 'd be 50/50 . 
  when they account for less than 2 % , no . 
  first of all , the referendum is ** advisory ** . 
  secondly , a 2 % difference for something this momentous just is n't enough . 
  stop . 
  calling . 
  that . 
  maybe they should n't act like idiots , then . 
  no , people are raping girls , and your obsession with their ethnic and cultural background in the wake of ** enormous ** sexual abuse scandals simply shows that you do n't give a fuck about the victims of this crime , but are just looking for another excuse to hate brown people . 
  yeah , that 's not equivocation . 
  i 'm not assuming . 
  i have you tagged . 
  it 's easier for you to see shades of gray when the perpetrators are n't brown or muslim , is n't it ? 
   equivocating i 'm not sure you know what that word means . 
  at least , it 's not very clear what point you 're trying to make . 
  catholic priests ? 
  westminster politicians ? 
  british television personalities ? 
  you mean like how those poor deluded fools used to think that you could work for 8 hours and get paid for 12 ? 
  are they coming to your house and inspecting your portions ? 
  they 're cracking down on ** advertising ** that seeks to illicit consumer reactions that overall have a negative impact on their health . 
  they have to review all advertising material anyway , this is n't some kind of moneyhole they 're throwing tax payer pounds into . 
  you do understand that there is a vast amount of scientific literature on the effects of advertising , right ? 
  especially on unrealistic body image . 
  i 'm not losing an argument , you 're explicitly arguing against established scientific facts . 
  [ google scholar ] ( https://scholar.google.no/scholar?hl=no&amp;q=body+image+advertising&amp;btng= ) [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/effects_of_advertising_on_teen_body_image ), 
  `` blablablabla , science does n't know what it 's talking about . 
  i do . '', 
  why are medical ads banned ? 
  why ca n't ads just outright lie ? 
  why does the advertising industry spend tons of money on psychology ? 
  why are sales people taught methods to take advantage of cognitive biases ? 
  why do stores put certain products in certain places ? 
  because it fucking works !, 
  you can whine all about how people who are affected by commercials are losers , but you 're one of them . 
  the model in the ad is photoshopped . 
  just imagine what the comments would look like in this thread if you exchanged the word `` christian '' with `` muslim '' in the headline . 
  migrants are overrepresented in every statistic regardless of background . 
  that 's part of the whole migration thing . 
  it is intrinsically a disruptive event . 
  i do n't understand why it 's so hard for people to say `` eeeeh , we fucked up '' once in a while . 
  always with the excuses and blame-shifting . 
  what a weird fantasy world you live in . 
  you do n't understand , dude . 
  there were no muslims involved in this , so there 's nobody to blame . 
  what the fuck are you talking about , dude ? 
  this has fuck all to do with personal freedom . 
  seriously ? 
  did you just compare nrk to fox news ? 
  unelected . 
  you do n't need an example to state that we are at an impasse . 
  you can just state that we are at an impasse . 
  when you start throwing in pointless examples using the islamic state and slavery , you ca n't really hide behind ignorance . 
  no , you implied that my position is equal to that of someone supporting the islamic state and slavery . 
  i fail to see how slavery has anything to do with economic activity ( beyond the obvious ) , unless you 're calling slaves a commodity , which further implies that you support slavery . 
  no , i 'm stating how things are and ** how they should be . 
  ** the state ** should have ** the power to regulate all economic activity . 
  when you engage in commerce , you accept the rules and regulations tied to it . 
  nobody forced this guy to become a landlord . 
  nobody 's forcing him to remain a landlord . 
  the state is n't forcing him to do anything .
