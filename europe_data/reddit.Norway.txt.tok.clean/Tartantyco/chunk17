  the state will simply uphold the rules and regulations he has agreed to . 
  private owners neither have , nor should , have a right to be free from government interference . 
  or do you think that i should be allowed to build a nuclear reactor on my property ? 
  the bbc is probably the most respected journalistic institution in the world . 
  i 'd say that tv tax is doing a good job . 
  nobody 's talking about government officials making some sort of sacrifice . 
  i 'm just pointing out the blatantly obvious : you can predict that individuals in certain positions will be targeted , and you can practically deter those attempts . 
  you simply ca n't do the same thing with the average citizen . 
  and if government officials are prone to be coerced through fear of violence , you 've essentially compromised the entire government for blackmail . 
  you 're just talking nonsense , man . 
  yeah , all those billionaire crime lord government officials ... you 're just talking bullshit , and i see no point in wasting any more time on you . 
  they just have to be the best at everything , do n't they ? 
  he 's not being personally targeted , though . 
  it 's not like they 're going to call off a terrorist attack because u/logseman is n't in the crowd . 
  how is this hard to understand ? 
  the office of the prime minister or president or whatever is ** always ** a potential target for assassination , and must consequently ** always ** be protected against it . 
  if a nation ca n't protects its government officials , that nation stops functioning . 
  the individuals who compose the general population are ** not ** specifically targeted . 
  instead , areas in which large amounts of the general population gather are targeted instead . 
  the guy who drove the truck during the nice attack was n't waiting for those specific people who were killed in the attack to show up . 
  which specific individuals were in the crowd was not of concern to the perpetrator . 
  consequently , those areas are being protected . 
  and that 's what happened here . 
  police protecting westminster put an end to the attack . 
  also , what about personal freedom , people ? 
  if you want the government to protect you as much as they do government officials you 're basically giving up your private life . 
  somehow this is just okay now , just so people can make naive rhetorical arguments ? 
  givernment officials are more important than your average civilian . 
  government officials are protected because they are always a plausible target for terrorists or just plain crazy people . 
  i 'm quite confident that you personally have never received a death threat , or that any terrorist plotter is even aware of your existence . 
  government spend tons of money on counter-terrorism operations . 
  there simply is no viable financial way to provide equal protection to every individual . 
  what front lines ? 
  of course they 're targeted . 
  that 's why the have protection . 
  if terrorists could kill the prime minister of great britain , they would do that in an instant . 
  but they 're not able to get to her , so they target civilians . 
  how long do you think trump would survive if he had no protection . 
  no , ** you ** specifically are not being targeted . 
  people in general are . 
  because they ca n't easily get to government officials . 
  but you can not in any viable financial sense manage to provide the same level of protection to everyone . 
  main street is n't specifically targeted by terrorists . 
  or would you be okay with your bank having the same level of protection as your wallet ? 
  so , are you gon na pay for that then ? 
  terrorists do n't target house 2 on random street 5 . 
  they target concentrated public centers , government and military institutions and installations , government and military officials and personnel , they target exactly the people who are being protected . 
  which is why they 're being protected . 
  iraqi officials live in the green zone and have protection details because they are specifically targeted . 
  the vast majority of the general iraqi population is not specifically targeted . 
  the iraqi government would be making no progress in making the population safe if half of their parliamentary members were getting killed every other day . 
  so we should leave government institutions vulnerable to attack ? 
  are you saying that those institutions should n't be protected ? 
  the norwegian `` most famous '' list is just hilarious .

  they 'll just lie about it anyways .

  the vikings were more than just raiders . 
  the viking nations were extensive trading nations , stretching all across europe , deep into russia , and to the middle east . 
  they were hugely influential in the development of europe , directly and through founding states such as normandy and russia . 
  comparing them to somalian raiders is a little inaccurate .

  well , when abortion is illegal you find other ways . 
  the question we all have to ask ourselves is this ; do we really need 10 million swedes in the world ? 
  yes . 
  scientists do not generally believe in magic . 
  and they are confident in being able to replicate it . 
  are you not aware of the massive research efforts going into ai right now ? 
  the race is on to make the first general ai , that is an ai capable of everything humans can currently do . 
  it 's really simple . 
  unless there is literally magic in the universe , intelligence and conciousness is simply the consequency of a physical process in the brain . 
  if that is true , it can and will be replicated . 
  there 's no magic involved . 
  just physical reality . 
  so you believe in magic ? 
  and why is that ? 
  what do you not understand about ** human obsolescence ** ? 
  nobody 's going to become robot makers because the robots will be far better at making more robots themselves . 
  humanity will be inferior in terms of both physical and mental capabilities compared to the machines . 
  ** when a new task or job is created , it will be filled by robots , not humans . 
  i think the reason why they do n't mention it is because they 're not retarded . 
  human obsolescence is on the horizon . 
  as ai and robotics reaches human parity , there will be no role for us as agents in the economy . 
  as we get closer and closer to that point , the jobs pool will continue to shrink and we will have chronic increasing unemployment . 
  here 's the difference this time : we 're looking at human obsolescence . 
  during the industrial revolution and the digital revolution , machines replaced ** tasks . 
  ** increased production lead to decreased prices , which led to increased consumption , which led to more jobs .
