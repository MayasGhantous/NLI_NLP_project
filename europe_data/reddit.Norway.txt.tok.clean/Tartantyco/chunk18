  with ai and robotics likely reaching human parity this century , we 're replacing ** humans . 
  ** you 're not going to create more jobs for humans to fill no matter how efficient your production chain is because it 's always going to be more cost-effective to get a machine to take the job instead . 
  and that will be true long before ai and robotics reach human parity , because you do n't need something that does a job just as well as a human if that thing does the job 24/7 for no pay . 
  in the end , politicians depend more on votes than they do on money . 
  not to mention berlin was entirely within east germany , so the wall only had to separate east and west berlin . 
  not the entire us/mexico border . 
  you do n't have to buy a new car to replace your car radio , you know . 
  this has been erdogan 's plan all along , to create a perpetual motion machine from ataturk 's spinning body to fuel his ottomechs as he conquers the world . 
  if you go to the nordic countries , you 'll find tons of products with instructions and even names written in both norwegian , swedish , danish , and finnish . 
  stop being disingenuous , we all know the jews control everything and must have orchestrated this . 
  illuminati confirmed !, 
  i guess it 's time for this sub to go into overreaction mode again , then . 
  yes , these 10 people will overrun all of europe by the year . 
  yeah , because the market never kept anything retarded going .

  you never have visitors ? 
  then you should be more careful about how you phrase your comments and what comments you respond to because , like it or not , that 's what you said . 
  this is the comment you replied to :  have n't the islam and the ( european ) west been in conflict for a while now ? 
  london , madrid , nice , paris , brussels , etc. 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5j8d2v/lorry_drives_into_german_market_bbc_news/dbe4ni0/ and there had n't been much conflict between europe and the middle east compared to inward conflict in both regions . 
  well , you should be easily able to snag a historian or two and tell them about the `` ongoing war '' between europe and islam that 's been `` going on since the early middle ages '' . 
  do n't expect to get an a. 
  that does n't bode well for you . 
  this has been happening and happening forever . 
  [ compared to the 70s and 90s , it 's pretty quiet ] ( http://qz.com/558597/charted-terror-attacks-in-western-europe-from-the-1970s-to-now/ ) . 
  your reaction is exactly what they want . 
  i 'm pretty sure he did n't drive the truck into every christmas market everywhere . 
  oh , here come the amateur historians . 
  this is not how you into nordics , estonia/latvia/lithuania . 
  considering the comment you replied to is my only comment in this thread , i seriously doubt that . 
  also , the burden of proof is on anyone who makes a claim , not whoever makes the first claim . 
  / u/buckby84 made claims about the future demographics of several countries , and he has to cite his sources if anyone 's going to take him seriously . 
  i do n't think you understand what fake news are . 
  fake news are not biased news spread through mainstream media , they 're literally made up `` news '' spread from fake news websites through social media . 
  an example of fake news is the claim that pope francis endorsed trump . 
  this did not happen . 
  it was not mentioned on mainstream media ( except to debunk the fake news ) . 
  yet , it spread like wildfire on social media and was believed by us voters . 
  mmmm , yes . 
  post your sources . 
   you know what i am tired of , people like you , telling me that the fact i love my country and i do n't want to see it go down the fucking drain makes me a racist piece of shit and a nazi . 
  i think it 's the racist stuff you say that makes people think you 're a racist . 
  come on , read the article at least . 
  nothing you bring up here is at all relevant to juncker 's statements . 
  they were just a couple out of 50 + arrests . 
  you only hear about notable people specifically . 
  they 're not going to list the three retail workers or whatever . 
  there 's four users that mod both / r/the _ donald and / r/le _ pen . 
  two in / r/the _ hofer , one on / r/the _ wilders . 
  this is n't very common . 
  most muslims who are that devout have arranged marriages within their own religion/ethnicity . 
  every single claim you make in your comment is incorrect . 
  you should n't go around accusing others of being naive . 
  no , it was n't . 
  and i did n't say that . 
  i said that there was a period in which irish nationalist terrorism was very commom compared to preceding and subsequent time periods . 
  it should be noted that during this period , irish nationalist terrorism did receive global sympathy and financial support , though . 
  islam , like socialism , is a borderless ideology . 
  irish nationalism obviously is n't . 
  consequently , terrorist acts follow the same pattern . 
  yes . 
  as i said [ in another comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6q61m9/man_stabs_shopper_to_death_and_injures_four/dkvs5x0/ ) , the reason why we have a lot of this right now is because islamic terrorism is `` in vogue '' . 
  just like socialist terrorism was `` in vogue '' 50-60 years ago , just like ira terrorism was `` in vogue '' 30-40 years ago , it is not islamic terrorism that is `` in vogue '' . 
  it 's not islam or muslims . 
  if that were the case , then we would have had these issues since the 50s . 
  it 's the result of a single , highly successful terrorist attack and the following decade-long wars destabilizing an entire region , allowing for radical groups to grow . 
  just like successful school shootings lead to more school shootings , successful terrorist acts lead to more terrorist acts . 
  see how using cars as weapons ( beyond carrying explosives ) was n't a thing before , and now it 's suddenly a thing ? 
  things become popular because they are successful , giving them a pedestal to propagandize from . 
  people go with that , no matter what it is , then it dies down again . 
  we 're having another spike now because of isis ' success . 
  just as 9/11 caused a spike of terrorist attacks . 
  but eventually , things calm down again . 
  come on , poland . 
  get your shit together . 
  i 've got a spare bedroom . 
  i could fit * at least * three desks in there . 
  competitive rates . 
  come on , let 's make a deal here . 
  they 're only a higher proportion because islamic extremism is `` in vogue '' right now . 
  if we 'd taken in the same amount of immigrants due to a national conflict between iraq and iran , for instance , this high proportion would not have materialized . 
  sadly , a couple dozen individuals , as part of a terrorist group that could count its membership only in the thousands , managed to incite the largest military power in the world to embark on decade-long wars that resulted in an economic cost of trillions of dollars , a human cost of millions of lives , and a massive boost to economic support and recruitment potential for islamic terrorist organizations . 
  just as successful and highly publicized school shootings result in more school shootings , successful and highly publicized terrorist attacks result in more terrorist attacks . 
  this is officially the saddest comment section on any post in / r/europe ever . 
   if a white person is born in africa , that white person is african ? 
  yes . 
  tusk staring at putin 's head thinking `` i could take him out right here . 
  just a karate chop and a snap , it 'd all be over .

   i am for unification but as long as it serves the benefits of eu and turkey equally , which was never proposed . 
  call me crazy , but i 'm for unification as long as it serves the people of cyprus best . 
   they became so after a treaty signed due to a war loss , with the same thinking one can claim the same for cyprus . 
  no , you ca n't claim the same thing . 
  greece 's ownership of the aegean islands is established by treaty and recognized by everyone . 
  northern cyprus is only recognized by turkey and has been given no legal concessions . 
   it is either turkey or eu which will make the choice , not anyone else .
