  we have more than enough of those . 
  green energy is n't non-invasive energy , it 's sustainable and non-polluting . 
  norway : http://i.imgur.com/nyxyfpo.jpg rash of fires due to a lack of snow and rain while strong winds sap all of the moisture out of the underbrush . 
  everything 's flammable right now . 
  have you ever considered not being retarded , russia ? 
  i do n't know , man . 
  i 'd love to be emperor of the world , as well . 
  but it really is just a saying to underline that you do not have the kind of power people often imagine you to have . 
  we have an intelligentsia ? 
  there 's no `` i '' in `` teamwork '' . 
  only to you peasants !, 
  there was no error on his part . 
  this whole ` problem ' lies squarely at the feet of the slovaks . 
  our nation has decided to uphold them , they are not imposed against our will . 
  our obligations are equal and we do not set them aside simply because they are inconvenient . 
  the idiocy of your argument is that you imply we intentionally allow violent and mentally unstable immigrants into the country . 
  the simple reality is that norway is in need of manpower , and the vast majority of immigrants do very little but work hard and try to ensure a better future for their children . 
  occasionally things like these happen . 
  but we accept them because the economic and social gains far surpass any losses . 
  you do remember that just two years ago an ethnic norwegian killed 69 people ? 
  how should we change our immigration policy to stop future anders breiviks ? 
  we do not want to become hateful , bigoted , and ignorant like you . 
  everyone living in norway does so at the expense of the norwegian taxpayers . 
  we fully accept that not all those people will live up to our expectations , but overall it is worth it . 
  you 're just a hateful person . 
  you need to address that . 
   i understand the nature and problems of immigration much more clearly than some bureaucrat in the utlendingsdirektoratet who thinks it is a good idea to use norwegian taxpayer money to `` resettle '' violent young unemployed men from south sudan in \u00c5rdal of all places !, 
   i understand that very , very clearly ... do you ? 
  yeah ... 
  i do n't believe you . 
  we have legal obligations to refugees under international law that ca n't just be put aside , and there is n't a huge influx of immigrants from japan and south korea . 
  neither do you get to pick your immigrants . 
  you just do n't understand the realities of the immigration situation . 
   ok tell me this . 
  why do we not have some sort of mental test that asylum seekers need to pass before they can enter the country ? 
  because that would be a practical impossibility , and because we have obligations under international law . 
  idiot . 
  i refer you to umamijesus ' comment . 
  nothing . 
  nooooooooooothing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  well , you have n't replied to the actual content of my comment , so i can only assume that you have none . 
  i 'll take that as a yes . 
  do you feel that you have to discredit me because you ca n't admit to yourself that you are wrong about something ? 
   how ridiculous are we going to get ? 
  the slippery slope argument is a fallacy . 
   i do n't care . 
  really , i do n't . 
  freedom is more important . 
  if we went with this inane philosophy we would n't have a ozone layer anymore . 
  the ban on cfc gases is the perfect example of how individual agents are unable to come together to cause coordinated action and how corporate interest will subvert the truth even to the detriment of all humanity . 
  and the idea that freedom is being able to ingest whatever you want shows that you do not know what freedom is . 
   where one person is not directly hurting anyone else well , it 's a good thing i can start feeding arsenic to children now that i have your blessing . 
   by your logic do n't start with the slippery slope fallacy . 
  in your attempt to be clever you make assumptions about fast food and my logic , both at which you fail horribly . 
   cmon . . do you know what aggregate behavior is ? 
  it 's when a lot of individuals separately do the same stupid thing , causing a marked impact on the world . 
  the very idea that ** you ** ca n't individually have any affect on the world is why cfc gases had to be ** banned ** , because neither producers nor consumers gave a fuck about the ozone depletion that was a direct threat to humanity . 
  the cfc ban is also a perfect example of the fact that people as individuals have no way of coming together as individual agents and taking coordinated action . 
  sometimes government has to ban shit because we 're to fucking retarded . 
  that does not mean we 'll start banning everything everywhere . 
  assuming that is the case is idiocy . 
  we are perfectly capable of drawing a line in the sand and saying `` no further '' instead of slowly rolling down a slippery slope . 
  no it is n't and no they should n't . 
  while a handgun and a nuclear missile are both weapons i assume you can see the validity of restricting access to at least one of those , so you are capable of understanding that treating similar things differently makes sense in a lot of cases . 
  when it comes to what you do with your body you are not an island unto yourself . 
  what happens to you ripples out an affects your family , your friends , your community , your country , and the world . 
  just because you think that because you pay for your own healthcare that you pay for your entire negative impact on the world due to your actions does not make it so . 
  additionally , you support the existence of the industry that provides you with your substance and that substance has a vested interest in increasing its consumer base , as well as the pollution created by the industry . 
  you are not an island unto yourself . 
  they are not comparable substances . 
  you 're a disgrace to your country . 
  [ the european megalopolis . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ), 
  inferior industry would likely pollute more . 
  less industry is probably the cause . 
  i know that if you play as them in medieval : total war you 'll get constant crusader armies walking through your territory stealing all your troops . 
  your research claims are bullshit . 
  birth rates are falling in muslim countries and immigrants to europe normalize with the rest of the population pretty quick . 
  stop ruining / r/mapporn with shitty colored wireframe maps . 
  actually , it 's always been shit . 
  carry on . 
  you 're confusing yourself . 
  first off , i 'm talking about statistics . 
  second , it 's not about there being information in a map , it 's about the information being the focus as opposed to the maps themselves . 
  [ one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6xjeawp.jpg ) and [ two ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ohbuzmt.jpg ) current submissions at r/mapporn . 
  essentially the same maps with different colors . 
  the focus is on the information contained ( suicide and capital punishment ) , not the maps themselves . 
  the maps are secondary . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/environment/oldmap/speed/speed.jpg ) would be an example of something that should be found on r/mapporn . 
  it could also be fantasy maps from lord of the rings , maps represented in unique ways , and so on , but the maps should be the actual focus . 
  uhm , no they 're not . 
  but that 's beside the point . 
  / r/mapporn should be about maps , but instead it 's just about information presented in map form . 
  what should be there is maps , not just the standard wikipedia wireframe map with different colors blotched onto it . 
  / r/mapporn is as crap as it has always been , i see . 
  still just / r/statisticsporn with maps instead of being about actual maps ... 
   you were the one saying it 's morally right to take money from some and give it to others . 
  for society . 
  not for individuals . 
  like taxation .
