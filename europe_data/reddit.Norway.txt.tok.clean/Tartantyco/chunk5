  then there 's conspiracy bullshit like leftist governments inviting immigrants so they get more votes , and actual quoting of ron fucking paul . 
  well , that was a big load of bullshit . 
  identity = / = culture . 
  they 're equally as racist ... do n't know what you thought you 'd prove here . 
  narrative manipulation . 
  nobody has been talking about left or right in this thread until your comment brought it up out of the blue . 
  uhhh , i support keeping dclauzel as a moderator . 
  i obviously care about the issue . 
  what i do n't give a fuck about is your butthurt . 
  yeah , retarded people often make a lot of noise . 
  i give not a single fuck . 
  it 's both low effort content and manipulative without context , so it is against the rules . 
  and here we have an example of it in practice , people . 
  and if he 's five times more active ? 
  do you even know what proportionality is ? 
  you 're only showing your ignorance of narrative manipulation techniques . 
  no , you 're assuming everything . 
  * you assume . 
   being white is a part of european culture , this is not a racist thing . 
  they 're young males because they can make the trip easier . 
  they depend on family reunification to get the rest of their family there . 
  he 's not liked * by you * . 
  it 's basically a sub for men who want to physically and mentally abuse women into sexual activity . 
  the racist shits that spam this sub use narrative manipulation techniques to control the conversation and affect opinions without ever breaking the rules . 
  maybe because any attempt to engage with the / r/europe community is like putting your dick in a bee hive ? 
   oh then he must be a racist for sure . 
  well ... yeah . 
  do you even know what / r/theredpill is ? 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  the horror . 
  i do n't think it 's been implemented yet . 
  yeah , the tongue loss is intriguing enough for it to be noteworthy . 
  however , i 'm pretty sure op is a racist shit as he 's going out of his way to point out that the rapist is pakistani . 
  except that 's not how people work . 
  do n't argue from utopia . 
  ahhh , rhetoric of convenience . 
  you 're hilarious . 
   you have filters if you do n't like it . 
  i 'm not trying to make the sub suitable for me , / r/europe is a default sub , and if all new subscribers are greeted with is frothing racism from the anti-immigration crowd , then that 's the only people who will continue to stay subscribed . 
  this is supposed to be a sub for and about europe , not for and about how the brown people are invading the great white western empire , and when the immigration topic does nothing but crowd out other content and divide the community , it 's not helpful for anyone . 
  yeah guys , remember the holocaust , where the germans deleted over 6 million comments and submissions made by jews ? 
  the thing is , your rules do diddly squat . 
  which was my point . 
  the people who are trying to manipulate the immigration conversation are n't outright saying racist stuff , they 're using narrative manipulation techniques in the comments of the submissions they flood the sub with to control and shift the users ' opinions concerning the immigration issue , and not a single one of your rules are being broken by them . 
  repetition of buzzwords like `` economic migrants '' , characterizations like `` greedy '' and `` selfish '' , building an `` us '' and `` them '' mentality . 
  [ this comment ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3j0y2l/migrants_try_to_elude_fingerprinting_at_hungary/culeecr ) is n't from / r/europe , but is a great example of narrative manipulation . 
  [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i8xoz/italy_refugees_and_migrants_shut_down_milans/cuec3qv ) from [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i8xoz/italy_refugees_and_migrants_shut_down_milans/ ) , which is brimming with examples , is another short but good example . 
  this is what you have to combat , along with the topic flooding and block up/downvoting . 
  it was never this bad before it got this bad ? 
  it got this bad a while ago , which is why they set up the megathreads . 
  when they took them down , it reverted to how it was before that , which is the current state . 
   silencing and ignoring people 's discontent with immigration will also divide and radicalize . 
  no , i 'm pretty sure it will just silence the racist shits . 
   the submissions are not racist . 
  the people who post them , though , fucking are . 
  yes , there are reasonable people with reasonable opinions against immigration , but they are few and far between , drowned out by the outright racism , constantly repeated ( and frequently false ) talking points , and propaganda . 
  when you start noticing block up/downvoting of submissions and comments related to immigration , you realize how much the conversation is manipulated by organized anti-immigration groups . 
  you know what does work , though ? 
  outright deleting submissions and banning users . 
  stop trying to make some kind of `` legal framework '' for the sub and just moderate it as you see fit to reach your objectives . 
  the immigration topic is doing nothing but dividing and radicalizing the sub 's community , allowing racist shits to spread bullshit propaganda . 
  they barely had room to move a finger , let alone build up enough momentum to exert any force . 
  if you 're in scandinavia + finland , they have the entire hd remastered series on hbo nordic . 
  if not ... well , a man has his ways . 
  ah , the folly of youth . 
  i suspect that you have no idea how a lot of things work . 
  same here . 
  uhm , because that 's how social welfare works ? 
  i 'm not saying he 's not muslim . 
  i 'm saying that you ca n't generalize this statement to be representative of what other syrians or muslims believe . 
  it 's the loonies who make themselves heard the most . 
  the daily mail is shit , do n't upvote content from that source . 
  there 's already like three articles about this on the front page . 
  yeah , because this guy 's rash outburst is representative of anything other than himself ... 
  well , this is very season 2 of the wire ... 
  it 's because they are . 
  just because i ca n't will it to happen does n't mean i do n't see it happen . 
  yeah , that 's not going to happen . 
  it 's not as if i get to decide when they reply to my comments , and it 's not as if i get a notification when they do . 
  i do n't think i have any comments out there right now that would be brigade targets , either . 
  a screenshot of what , exactly ? 
  thankfully , i do n't give a fuck . 
  if you paid any attention to voting patterns , you 'd see the blatant brigading quite clearly . 
  the easiest one is when you make a comment reply and it remains at 1 karma for hours . 
  then , when the user you replied to replies to your comment , it suddenly gets 10-20 downvotes within a few minutes . 
  start tagging people and you 'll quickly see how certain people start popping up in comments , making the same feigned statements , using the same euphemisms instead of outright racism , getting a lot of upvotes in a short time . 
  i can literally see the individual waves of brigades coming and going throughout the day . 
   and there 's the sticking point . 
  i believe that evidence proves facts . 
  you would n't know a fact if it fucked you in the ass . 
  making massive assumptions based on a citation that you ca n't even read . 
   have i argued that left-wing politicians do this ? 
  i guess politicians are n't part of the european left , then . 
  retard . 
   sorry , but i 'm not interested in arguing with someone who admits that evidence is n't important to them in this debate . 
  you 're the one that does n't believe evidence is important . 
   so you are criticizing me for having `` no '' evidence , but you do n't want me to provide more evidence . 
  no , i 'm criticizing you for having no evidence , but it 's not as if i will remove your comment through the cunning use of magic if you do n't provide any . 
  stop confusing yourself . 
   or you could prove me wrong by telling me ( third time i ask ) how many pieces of evidence are necessary to satisfy your requirement for sufficient evidence .
