  if you actually interact with immigrants and refugees on a frequent basis , you will find that most of them just want to get through the classes so that they can get back to work again . 
  you have doctors who have to retake high school because any documentation they had was destroyed or is inaccessible due to war , tradesmen whose skills are obsolete or unnecessary in their host country , and so on . 
  and you have just as many unskilled workers as are in the native population , who have no chance of competing on the job market as they have poor language skills and are unfamiliar with everything in the country . 
  so no , you ca n't just go to the local welfare office and say `` me arab , giff money '' . 
  also , iran , afghanistan , turkey , somalia , and eritrea are n't arab . 
  i wonder how much time you spent writing all that bullshit . 
  not a single comment about how `` these sub-humans should learn to behave themselves in a western society '' ? 
  no `` what can we do to stop this kind of behavior '' ? 
  no `` these people should be grateful to live in [ insert country here ] '' ? 
  not even a `` how do these people think this use of violence will accomplish anything '' ? 
  yeah , it 's not so easy to spin when the culprits are n't `` the darkies '' , is it ? 
  oh , look at all this stuff you mentioned that in no way makes europe a christian continent.we `` celebrate '' christian holidays ( half of which are pagan in origin anyway ) because of tradition an because we like holidays . 
  fucking nobody celebrates the resurrection of jesus on easter . 
  again , when the majority of european countries start voting explicitly christian parties that seek to impose an exclusively christian law and morality you can start calling europe christian . 
  [ here 's some actual stats on what people actually believe , instead of your dumb shit . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_europe ) fuck , you probably think north korea is a democratic republic as well . 
  i 'm likely older than you , and i do n't treat things with any more respect than they deserve . 
  your historical dogma and illiteracy has little effect . 
  ihnoring the fact that half your post is bullshit , that does not make europe a christian continent . 
  all european governments are secular , and are the least affected by religion in the world ( with a few exceptions in either direction , of course ) . 
  this europe is christian '' bullshit is just another euphemism for people who just ca n't say that they do n't want muslims to come here . 
  you 're fooling noone . 
  it 's deeply entwined with my dick . 
  the simple fact of the matter is that for the vast majority of europeans support secular government . 
  call me when the spanish inquisition starts back up again . 
   christian continent . 
  lol , no . 
  no , 21,000 this week is not 1,095,000 per year . 
  it 's 21,000 this week . 
  well , there goes the neighbourhood ... 
  but when i switch to satellite view , the water is still there !, 
  this is obviously some polish ruse to steal all of our water , along with all of our jobs !, 
  i 'm not talking about police racism . 
  at no point were we talking about police racism . 
  nothing in your post is relevant to what we were talking about . 
  make another reply to my comment , one that is actually responding to the content of my comment , and i may bother to give you a reply . 
  i 'm not denying reality . 
  you 're making one up . 
  the ` multicultural policing ' you babble on about is literally illegal . 
  does law enforcement often engage with , and get assistance from , community organizations ? 
  yes . 
  that has been true forever . 
  does law enforcement delegate some of its responsibility to such community organizations ? 
  fuck no . 
  this is the same bullshittery as the `` sharia law in the uk '' nonsense . 
  i 've already read it . 
   multicultural policing stop pretending like this is a thing . 
  apparently , [ f\u00e5rik\u00e5l ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%a5rik%c3%a5l ) is our national dish . 
  i must have eaten it last year sometime , ca n't remember . 
  i live on this planet , actually . 
  there are no races . 
  this thread is not why you 're tagged as a racist . 
  there 's a reason why he 's tagged as ` racist ' in my res . 
  i 've never met a muslim who did n't order his hamburger with bacon ( norway ) . 
  meh , that 's pretty decent . 
  it 's like 60 's numbers for christians . 
  yes , i 'm here for the position of village idiot . 
  is that not normal elsewhere ? 
  you always ask if customers want the receipt , unless they buy something minor , like a pack of gum , in norway . 
  / r/europe has a pretty serious racist-boner against roma peoples . 
  i just threw a perfectly good pea in the trash to annoy you .

   yea sure . 
  and you dont have an ulterior motive by posting them right ? 
  the fuck does this sentence even mean ? 
  i did n't post shit . 
  is this supposed to be some lame attempt at an argument ? 
  regardless , i do n't have an ulterior motive . 
  i have the * explicit * motive of calling out racist shits like you , because you 're ruining this sub . 
  there 's plenty of communities centered around religion , nationality , and culture all over europe . 
  why do n't you ask why those exist ? 
  i 'm not painting everyone , i 'm painting * you * . 
  because you 've explicitly lied about the video around three times in this thread , at last count . 
  when someone asked for context on the video , this was your reply :  come illegally to a country that never asked you to come and do n't want you to  get rejected because you are an illegal  riot because the country rejected you while shouting allahu akbar to show them they are really missing out by not letting you enter and settle on their lands  ??? 
  none of that is true , so either you made up that narrative based on your underlying racist feelings , or you intentionally created that narrative to further your racist beliefs . 
  you are a racist , i 'm afraid . 
  whether you want to be or not . 
  i ca n't remember anyone arguing that rioting is acceptable . 
  you should get stormfront to pay for a refresher course in manipulative racist arguing tactics 101 , because it 's evident that you 're slipping . 
  here 's the deal ; this riot happened . 
  as did the 2011 stanley cup riots . 
  neither of them are indicative of a general trend , either for muslim refugees to europe , or canadian hockey fans . 
  trying to make either of them into something more is without any basis . 
   rioting while shouting `` god is great ''  indicative of nothing at all . 
  because someone trampled a qu ` ran . 
  ya dummy . 
  you just ca n't stop de-contextualizing , can you ? 
  they 're two examples of people rioting for stupid reasons . 
  anyone trying to draw general conclusions based on any of them is either an idiot , or has an ulterior motive .
