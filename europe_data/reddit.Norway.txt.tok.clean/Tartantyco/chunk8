  no , my point is that this is an isolated incident that was quickly dealt with by local law enforcement . 
  that 's all this is , yet people are trying to make it into something more than it is . 
  the video is n't indicative of anything at all to anyone with a shred of integrity , and is only used by racist shits to further their racist beliefs . 
  you can see it so easily when someone asks for context on the video , and are provided nothing but lies and non-answers . 
  because the truth is n't really that scary . 
  so please , stop being part of the fearmongers . 
  you mean that * one time * a bunch of muslims rioted inside a refugee camp after some dude trampled a qu ` ran and was n't killed or anything , and then the police came and settled everything down ? 
  [ you must be terrified of canadians . 
  since all the racist shits are hard at work spinning this as much as they can , let me give you some actual information on the video : it 's from a refugee camp in hungary . 
  some dude trampled a qu ` ran and the muslims got upset , starting a riot . 
  the riot took place in the refugee camp . 
  police arrived and calmed shit the fuck down . 
  the racist cunts of / r/europe , like / u/grutte _ alk , want to pawn this off as some common and serious issue that is threatening all of europe . 
  meanwhile , a bunch of canadians rioted in 2011 after a hockey game , killing 1 person and injuring around 140 . 
  you look like a man !, 
  that 's not how you manipulate public opinion . 
  direct statements of racism and such are not very helpful at persuading people . 
  instead , they use tactics like those seen in this thread . 
  a perfect example is [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3drhrn/illegal_immigrants_flood_debrecen_hungary/ct832ma ) :  why the fuck are n't we controlling this better ? 
  it provides a reasonable basis ( this behavior is not good ) , frames it as if it is a serious and pressing issue , and serves as a springboard for further comments presupposing the same . 
  pretty much every comment is of this nature , tipping the conversation in the direction of racist opinions and attitudes . 
  why are n't we controlling a spontaneous riot in a refugee camp better ? 
  well , they already did . 
  this is n't some ongoing event , this was a sudden riot sparked off by some dumbass taking someone 's qu ` ran and trampling on it , and it was all shut the fuck down by the police . 
  it is under control . 
  really , your comment sounds like it 's staged to create a specific narrative . 
  ca n't all you fuckers just dust off the nazi flags and start digging mass graves already ? 
  it 's getting tiresome reading the same racist garbage on / r/europe every day . 
  it was a refugee camp . 
  somebody trampled on the qu ` ran . 
  a lot of muslim refugees got antsy . 
  police shut it all down . 
  end of story . 
  meanwhile , you shits are trying to make this out to be some sort of muslim mob invading a city center to seize control of it . 
  yeah , those fucking jews . 
  wait , i might be 80 years late . 
  no , but it just so happens that i 'm not comparing that . 
  i 'm comparing parental ability to effectively , and in a healthy manner , police the actions and behavior of their children . 
  yeah , why ca n't my 8-year-old buy some beer a pack of cigarettes at the store ? 
  it should be the parents ' responsibility , right, 
  that 's a pretty decent adjacency bonus . 
   georgia wont do nothing so they will do something ? 
  why ca n't you just leave them alone ? 
  they 're a constant source of amusement over at / r/enoughlibertarianspam , and this is interfering with that . 
  well , if you 'd read the comment i replied to , you 'd be in possession of this glorious thing called ` context ' . 
  i did n't know belgium was in romania . 
  thanks for enlightening me . 
  please do n't dilute the meaning of ` fascist ' with your retardation . 
  oh man , this is just such a huge pile of bullshit . 
  not only are welfare recipients such a tiny percentage that they have little effect on elections , but welfare recipients rarely even vote . 
  the reason why people on welfare can often be resistant to taking a job is that working does n't actually earn them money , it just replaces their welfare with earned income . 
  this means that someone working 30 % does n't earn more money , they just get less welfare , to the sum that their total income remains the same , ** and often even less ** . 
  that 's what we call a perverse incentive . 
  polish people always buy beer and white bread in stores . 
  just beer and white bread . 
  you do n't have arguments , you simply have misapprehensions as horrid as the one i mentioned in my previous comment . 
  not to mention , i 've already answered them . 
  well , it is quite evident that it is pointless discussing this with you . 
  if you do n't understand that there is a difference between ** an individual act ** and ** an aggregate outcome ** then there really is no hope for you . 
  elections must be mind boggling to you . 
  you 're arguing against facts , i 'm afraid . 
  it 's a battle you will surely lose . 
  there is a reason why subs decline in quality as they increase in popularity . 
  it 's not because people are dumb . 
  as i said in another comment :  it 's why subs deteriorate in quality as they grow . 
  it 's why unmoderated public servers in any game are generally shit . 
  it 's why littering is an issue . 
  people are unable to understand the aggregate effect of their actions , they are more likely to make exceptions for their own behavior , anonymity makes them less likely to follow the rules , and their often casual relationship to something makes them unfamiliar with rules and intentions to begin with . 
  if you believe the potential for manipulation exists , either by mod filtering , by news sources shaping the narrative , or whatever , then you must also inherently believe that people are n't able to recognize bad content on their own . 
  your entire argument rests on a contradiction that borders on absurdity . 
  you are manufacturing your own narrative , completely derailed from reality , in which the users have perfect knowledge of all things , and have no biases but for the truth . 
  the difference is that a mod team actually communicates before making a decision , so they do n't depend on their individual opinions . 
  they are checked by other people who may hold different opinions , and are more rigorous in their filtering as a consequence . 
   is n't an aggregation a group of individuals ? 
  the effect of an individual act and an aggregate outcome is not the same . 
  you consistently make the mistake of talking about individuals when discussing aggregation . 
  basically , what you 're saying is that i ca n't count on you to filter content on / r/europe . 
  you 're not really building a case for userbase-filtering here . 
  it is exactly this issue that leads to user filtering being worse than mod filtering . 
  the users do n't get together and discuss the merits of various news sources , they just upvote and downvote based on their individual opinions . 
  with a small mod group , you have actual interaction , discussion , and the inability to just downvote things you do n't agree with . 
   can you address my first question ? 
  how can you possibly filter content without implementing bias ? 
  i ca n't remember making such a claim . 
  i was only talking about selective bias in terms of filtering in or out specific narratives , as was the context of my comment . 
  what i want is bias in terms of quality content . 
   you realize that those are n't their real names , right ? 
  thanks , captain obvious . 
  this does not make them unaccountable . 
   for example ? 
  why would this inherently be true ? 
  perhaps if that group was qualified and had some sort of oversight , but placing this task in the hands of a group of unknown and unqualified individuals with unknown biases is just asking for trouble . 
  because one group has an objective , while the other does not . 
  you 'd be surprised by how competence increases simply by giving someone a task . 
  again , the quality of filtering by users is well-attested as being complete and utter shit . 
  even horribly biased filtering by a small group is better than the refuse cobbled together by a chaotic mass of people . 
  however , the mods literally hold all the power possible in this sub already . 
  if they are intent on manipulating the content of the sub in a specific manner , there is nothing we could do now to stop it that we could n't do if they applied a reliability tag system . 
  no , tagging domains based on reliability is specifically ** not ** having `` 10 people [ ... ] chose what we should read or not ( * sic * ) '' . 
   wo n't some people downvote based on the unriable source tag ?
