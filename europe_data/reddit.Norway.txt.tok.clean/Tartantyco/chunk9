  how does it fix the problem ? 
  the answer to this question is literally in the comment you replied to ... 
  why would i want a bunch of anonymous , unaccountable , unqualified users filtering my content ? 
  meanwhile , the names of the mods are listed in the bar to your right . 
  anyways , here 's the answer i posted in another comment :  because a small group whose function is to filter content is much better at it than people who have no such distinct function , as evidenced by every single instance in which pure user filtering is applied . 
  no , it is simply a derailing of the discussion . 
  everything humans do is biased in some way . 
  however , if you ca n't tell the difference between the bbc and the daily mail , you 're retarded . 
  because some people are n't aware that the daily mail is pure shit . 
  some people do n't notice the domain . 
  some people upvote based on the headline . 
  if there is a tag there that informs people of the reliability of the source , they may not do any of that . 
  and i really do n't think downvoting an unreliable source is anywhere near as bad as upvoting one . 
  please keep your tinfoil hat bullshit out of this discussion . 
  they already do control the direction of the sub , by virtue of being its moderators . 
  they can make whatever decision they like , and there 's nothing you can do about that . 
  the rules and guidelines linked to in the right bar did n't fall down from heaven , they were written by the mods . 
  because a small group whose function is to filter content is much better at it than people who have no such distinct function , as evidenced by every single instance in which pure user filtering is applied . 
  it 's why subs deteriorate in quality as they grow . 
  it 's why unmoderated public servers in any game are generally shit . 
  it 's why littering is an issue . 
  people are unable to understand the aggregate effect of their actions , they are more likely to make exceptions for their own behavior , anonymity makes them less likely to follow the rules , and their often casual relationship to something makes them unfamiliar with rules and intentions to begin with . 
   bbc provides news , but they do not filter things that are news because they do n't like the subject . 
  okay , i see no point in further discussing this with you if all you can do is set up strawmen . 
  nobody 's talking about filtering because they do n't like the content , or because it does n't represent their point of view . 
  we are talking about tagging media sources and domains that are known for posting misleading or straight up false information to manipulate their audience . 
   so you 're asking mods to filter it for you ? 
  yes , obviously . 
  just like the / r/askhistorians mods filter the content and comments of that sub and provide excellent content as a consequence . 
  just like the bbc filters content for me , which is considered the best news provider in the world . 
  the idea that `` filtering '' inherently means spoonfeeding content and selective bias is complete nonsense . 
   i think that mods should remove irrelevant links , spam , editorialized titles etc and they should not tell users whether something is good or bad just because it 's on a specific domain . 
  that may be your opinion , but that does not change the reality that people are bad at filtering content on their own . 
   if majority of people decide to upvote an article that does not represent your point of view , but is highly relevant to the european subreddit then so be it . 
  why are you objecting that ? 
  super strawman detected . 
  great job !, 
  why are people always arguing that the users should be solely responsible for filtering content , when ** every single time ** any sub ( or anything , period ) has tried it , it fails so fucking miserably ? 
  upvotes and downvotes do n't mean `` i 've consumed this content and it is good/bad '' , it just means somebody clicked the upvote or downvote . 
  most often that is done purely on the basis of the headline , which is where less reputable media sources try to manipulate the readers . 
  this is why / r/funny is so full of hilarious content . 
  because people can be trusted to filter content on their own ... 
  yeah , because that works ... 
  actually , religion has historically been a substantial portion of categorizing race . 
  the idea that racism is purely a matter of biological differences is an extremely modern one . 
  yeah , none of that is true . 
  all of that shit is stuff that could be resolved by reporting it to the police , you fucking moron . 
  keep telling yourself that . 
  i 'm sure it helps rationalize your insane racism away .

  damn you , tzeentch !, 
  then freedom of speech does n't exist anywhere . 
  based on us experiences , preventive check-ups are n't all that cost-effective . 
  there 's a healthcare triage episode on it , i 'll see if i can find it later . 
  no part of creating and maintaining good government requires you to be in government . 
  you can be part of political parties , engage in politics on a local level , involve yourself in interest groups , etc. 
  your second paragraph is just a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  fuck that shit . 
  we need people who are willing to involve themselves in creating and maintaining good government , instead of shutting themselves in and making tinfoil hats .

  itt : people trying to justify their racism . 
  you 're misreading . 
  the mod in question is saying that the people who converted to islam during ottoman rule were weak and treacherous . 
  as if serbs did n't convert to christianity at one point . 
  wow , til all of europe is literally nazi collaborators , as they all pretty much converted from paganism to christianity . 
  ** part of ** the world , not the same political institution . 
  which is what jogeid implied . 
  what kind of retarded logic is this ? 
  does participating in the world cup mean you support a world government ? 
  `` hurr durr , how can you be a socialist and still have job ? '', 
  you should n't have phrased it that way . 
  the slippery slope is a fallacy . 
  more like the major parties seriously muddied the waters , seriously confusing people as to what the alternative vote was , and in the end this uncertainty led to people voting for what they knew . 
  you know , your argument might have a sliver of credibility if there were n't a ton of countries successfully using a proportional representation system . 
  if you want a quick and concise explanation of the issues with fptp voting , as well as a run-through of alternatives , you could check out [ cgpgrey 's videos on the subject .

  first past the post voting . 
  if you have two candidates running for a seat and one gets 54 % of the vote , the other 46 % , the one with the 54 % wins and the opinion of the other 46 % is just worthless . 
  if you have three candidates , 34 % / 33 % / 33 % , the 34 % wins and the remaining 66 % lose . 
  you can see where it goes from there . 
  fptp voting pretty much necessitates voting tactically instead of voting for who you support , and it severely punishes and disincentivizes minor parties .
