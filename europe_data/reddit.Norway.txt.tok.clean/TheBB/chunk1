oh , you mean east tr\u00f8ndelag . 
  ah , that 's true . 
  but wiese is pretty far from appenzell . 
  a wiese is a meadow . 
  no , no , that 's * discreet * . 
  the author is pointing out that the dutch are not discrete , i.e. 
  they form a continuous mass without individuality . 
  i feel they should be labeled by language rather than country , since in many cases there 's not a one-to-one correspondence between the two . 
  and wow , that iceland to hungary transition ... 
  i like you . 
  one of the norwegians is a woman . 
   such digital identification and signing is legally fully equal to face-to-face identification and handwritten signatures in the european union . 
  so , if the contract specifies price per volume , can we pick the pressure ? 
  i will throw a fit if we do n't get this too . 
  yes , the 1066 invasion was definitely not by france . 
  but there 's a later french invasion , which sounds rather successful to me . 
  ( not that i 've done more than skim the page . ), 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_england_ ( 1326 ) it would perhaps be easier to pass judgement on this map if it came with any hint of which invasion is meant . 
  i 'm aware , but hostile foreign forces on domestic soil really is an invasion , no matter how much local popular support they have . 
  when did the french succesfully invade the uk ? 
  i was under the impression it should be the dutch invasion of 1688 . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glorious_revolution, 
  napoleonic wars . 
  they like to pretend based on a technicality that switzerland has never been invaded . 
  ( at least my swiss friends do . ), 
  while the old confederation was formed a long time ago , the modern swiss federation only came about in 1815 . 
  france conquered switzerland in 1798, 
   i ca n't imagine what one might do in ede . 
  i do my girlfriend in ede , but you 're right , it 's not the most spectacular place . 
  really ? 
  i was in ede on saturday and got like 100mm in my face . 
  efa does n't have a northern irish member party , so they would n't be on the map . 
  likely the same case for yugoslavia . 
  it 's just a map of the regions claimed by members and observers of efa ( among the latter of which you will find fhrul ) . 
  i do n't think the author of the article should take the blame . 
  after all , efa has a [ similar map ] ( http://www.e-f-a.org/whos-who/member-parties/ ) on their own website . 
  besides , she does say `` rough idea '' . 
  at least it 's not * that * map again . 
  all my scandinavian friends are mentioning each other , but i 'm going with switzerland . 
  i lived there for five years , so i guess it 's a bit of a cop-out . 
  if i 'm not allowed to say that i 'd go with sweden over denmark . 
  denmark is just a bit too crowded and urbanised to feel like home . 
  besides , i can talk with the swedes . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_state_of_novorossiya fixed yer link . 
  i guess i should have said `` something ** in russia ** that i will not believe is russian '' , in keeping with the thread .

  drugs . 
  http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/a-closer-look-at-drugs/32308034 picture 16 . 
   august 1994 . 
  the drug scene around the disused letten area in zurich attracted hundreds of drug addicts every day . 
  norway , perhaps . 
  the alps are much younger and therefore also much less rounded . 
  but that actually makes sense , because the mountains on the british isles and those in scandinavia are all parts of the caledonides . 
  they were formed at the same time and more or less of the same stuff . 
  as big and diverse as russia is , i think you 'll have a hard time finding something i will not believe is russian . 
  edit : something that * is * russian , which i will not believe is russian . 
  i 've been out west in connacht , and it looked very much like this . 
  edit : just realised it was the same place . 
  i lived in switzerland for five years . 
  that might have something to do with the splotch down there . 
  zurich old town ? 
  i lived in zurich for five years , and after quite a few friends coming to visit and me trying to entertain them , i 've come to the conclusion that zurich just is n't that great for tourists . 
  okay , unless you 're a shopping tourist . 
  or possibly a museum tourist ... 
  i met people on the plane who went there strictly to see kunsthaus exhibitions . 
  bern and luzern are much nicer towns . 
   i was wfk-ing i 'm trying to imagine what this entails . 
  i can only assume there are no signs of human development up there to index . 
  the wikipedia page linked further up the tree has a trend column . 
  okay , thanks . 
  but then it should still be discreet . 
  discreet ? 
  or is there a joke i 'm not getting ? 
  is it really so weird ? 
  if the uk ( say ) had no opponents of the euro , they would be using the euro . 
  they have to be fuzzed , otherwise you would n't see anything . 
  roads are n't * that * wide . 
  you can see for yourself . 
  go to google maps , zoom in a bit more and lift the yellow man and wait for the coverage map to load . 
  it 's normalised to population , so perhaps not so surprising . 
   the equator lines latitude . 
  haha , thanks for this . 
  perhaps not , but i feel it 's entirely reasonable to expect this to have been caught at an earlier time . 
  i assume that she 's already an icelandic citizen and that this is her actual name . 
  should n't the approval of names happen upon registration instead of when you apply for a passport ? 
   both she and a sibling , duncan , have `` not been approved '' by the icelanding naming committee , reports icelandic review , and their names are officially listed as st\u00falka ( ` girl ' ) and drengur ( ` boy ' ) . 
  so why was she not given a passport that says `` st\u00falka '' , if that is her official name as an icelandic citizen ? 
  no , there are hundreds of software layouts . 
  here are some of the choices on my system , under english : http://i.imgur.com/euzca0i.png . 
  for example , [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qwerty#mediaviewer/file:kb_intl_english_mac_-_apple_keyboard_\\ ( mc184z \\ ) . svg ) is the international english apple keyboard layout , which is iso , but has @ on 2 . 
  the physical layout does n't really matter . 
  what symbol is produced is decided by the software layout . 
  i 'm using a us software layout on an iso keyboard . 
  try to select only one of these apostrophes : '' you 'll notice that you are able to do that . 
  now try to select only one of these : '' you ca n't . 
  that 's because it 's one single symbol . 
  if you 're using a dutch keyboard , you can try shift +2 . 
  [ see here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qwerty#mediaviewer/file:nederlandse_toetsenbordindeling_-_tekst_als_paden.svg ) , or just look at your damn keys . 
  you must not have seen swiss german written down . 
  there 's a reason they do n't do it . 
  just wondering .
