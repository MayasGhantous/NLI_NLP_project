  trust me , i 've been to copenhagen in the winter and it was miserable . 
  where was your friend from ? 
  it 's not like norway has a shortage of sea or westerlies . 
  they must continue to accept northern cypriots as legitimate citizens of cyprus and the eu . 
  if they do not , they implicitly accept the legitimacy of the northern government as something separate from cyprus . 
  even better . 
  the ` presenter ' ( or whatever , the guy who said that ) is speaking norwegian , not danish . 
  you 'd call it gobbledygook or something . 
  it 's called the ` land of fire ' . 
  their tourism industry uses this for all that it 's worth . 
  there 's a more active one here : http://reddit-stream.com/comments/257xfl/, 
  surely these member states already have a permanent military presence in their own borders ? 
  not really , the application is suspended . 
  awful village hospital ? 
  ouch . 
  `` there '' ? 
  where ? 
  the pictures are from all over . 
   * e : / s the day reddit comments became harder to read than obfuscated c. 
  me too . 
  fucking bahrain and brunei . 
  to tell people how to pronounce his name . 
  all russian words are stressed on precisely one vowel , but it 's borderline impossible to know which one without having simply learned it . 
  that 's why you 'll find this kind of accent almost everywhere in russian learning material for foreigners ( possibly also in russian school books , i do n't know ) , but basically nowhere in russian texts produced for russians ( such as the russian language version of the putin wikipedia page . ), 
  for example , in english we mostly pronounce ** vla ** dimir and ** bo ** ris with the stress on the first syllable , while the russians say vla ** di ** mir and bo ** ris ** . 
  i assume you just copied that from wikipedia :p . the accent is there to tell you which vowel to stress , it 's not actually used in written russian . 
  or before ... and certainly not during . 
   only habitable building ( * sic * ) are ranked , which excludes radio masts and towers , observation towers , steeples , chimneys and other tall architectural structures . 
  ha , i had to give them my residence permit number and wait for it to be approved . 
  i do n't think so ? 
  at least in switzerland you need proof of residency to get a phone number . 
  i know they 're not eu but they are at least in the ( practical ) eea for the time being . 
  it would be more correct to say that corporations and people are both legal entities . 
  well , both . 
  i believe ford said he wrote more but the editor shortened it . 
  at least i can sleep comfortably tonight sure in the knowledge that you 're not running a country . 
  if there was ever a way to antagonise a country , this would be it . 
  not really . 
  they just are n't . 
  http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement/eea-basic-features  the european economic area ( eea ) brings together the eu member states and three of the efta states ( ** iceland , liechtenstein and norway ** ) . 
  switzerland has a separate set of treaties with the eu . 
  it covers many of the same things as the eea agreement ( to the point of being mostly indistinguishable to the average joe ) , but it 's still not the eea agreement . 
  they are not members of the eea either . 
  technically . 
  iceland is n't a nato-member so that they can contribute monetarily . 
  it 's in order to deter invasion of a strategically very important island in the north atlantic ( nato = ** north atlantic ** treaty organization ) . 
  yes , exactly approximately half . 
  hey now , / r/aww is awwsome . 
   i highly prefer content whose only purpose is not to be readable in a few seconds and garner karma . 
  i guess you meant `` whose purpose is not only to ... '' as it 's written it sounds like you prefer posts specifically designed to be unreadable . 
  it does n't have to be to show up in the list . 
   it ` self that 's a new one . 
  yes , although the map appears to be from march 2010 . 
  country level ? 
  now that 's big . 
  eu * map . 
  but it does n't say < 30 , it says 30 < . 
  they have some claim to h\u00e4ndel though , at least in my mind . 
  i would go with lady godiva , although i 'm sure there 's tons of british art that i do n't know is british . 
  i really liked copenhagen . 
  i know this is tantamount to treason for a norwegian to say , but there you have it . 
  berlin was also really cool . 
  i had a great time there . 
  bern and strasbourg are both amazingly beautiful . 
  honourable mentions to budapest , florence and all those small ticinese and italian towns ( como , lugano ... ) . 
  rome is swamped in tourists , but if you can mentally block them out there 's history to be had there like nowhere else . 
  luzern is up there with bern for my pick of switzerland , perhaps also lausanne . 
  some places i expect would be cool but where i have n't been : istanbul , krakow , barcelona , st. petersburg . 
  that 's not quite the same thing . 
  your data are about actual discrimination . 
  you can suffer a feeling of hostility and unfriendliness without ever being subjected to discrimination . 
  i 've been working and living in switzerland for 4 1/2 years . 
  i do feel unwanted to a degree , though i do n't see much of it since my workplace is full of foreigners , and my social circle is quite accepting . 
  i am absolutely not scared of my neighbours . 
  the development worries me though , and i 'm considering going back to norway or maybe finding work somewhere else , since my contract runs out soon anyway . 
  i 'm very highly educated , but i guess it 's up to the swiss to consider whether that 's a loss to them or not . 
  they are not . 
  they have their own bilateral agreement with the eu . 
  norway is in the eea , switzerland is n't . 
  what is switzerland doing in that gallery ? 
  edit : people seem to think switzerland is an eea member . 
  this is incorrect , although they do have their own bilateral treaty which ( i assume ) covers many of the same things . 
  i just thought it was strange , i 'm not really trying to be pedantic . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_national_transliteration ) is the official ukrainian transliteration into latin . 
  then it 's just a matter of looking up the letters . 
  ** viktor fedorovych yanukovych ** interestingly , his russian middle name is \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 , which should read something like fyodorovich . 
  there are large parties in favour of the eu on both sides of the spectrum , but they 've all agreed to shelve those ideas for the moment after the 1994 referendum . 
  that makes it practically a non-issue for election purposes . 
  with a gigantic lake right on the border i guess that makes sense . 
  edit : turns out , macedonia has a couple , too . 
  does n't imgur reduce resolution if it 's too high ? 
  the modern name for that state is austria-hungary and he was from the hungarian part . 
  the first that sprung to my mind is ignaz semmelweis , but it turns out he 's hungarian . 
  i would nominate [ fridtjof nansen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fridtjof_nansen ) . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.badassoftheweek.com/nansen.html ) a more entertaining account , with some factual errors . 
  ( in particular , 50km skiing is really not that far , and the race is regularly offered . ), 
  i do n't know what 's with your version , but the source looks much better . 
  the uk is not a schengen member . 
  why would they adhere to the schengen rules just got fun ? 
  i need a passport to go there , and the border ( effectively airports , harbors and the channel ) is watched .
