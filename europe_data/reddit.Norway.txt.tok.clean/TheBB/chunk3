  my gf has a schengen visa but could n't travel to the uk for 5 days without filling in an 80-page application . 
  `` ever '' is a long time . 
   why is n't all of europe included in this plan ? 
   we have chosen to offer this service in the entire eu , plus norway and iceland . 
  it is quite possible that we will add more countries in the future . 
  is it just me or did they just not answer the question ? 
  no offense , but you seem to have an extremely warped view of how much data an average person uses , and it scares me a bit how dependent you seem to be on digital services . 
  i rather enjoy being able to hear myself think , and nothing will kill a train ride or a dump like a good book . 
  i was expecting some massive crowds and whatnot . 
  he could just have been unaware of the difference . 
  not everything is premeditated . 
  humour does n't have to be false . 
   it 's not an adaptation to weather . 
  in fact it 's the reverse . 
  til my nose can control the weather !, 
  it seems to me he 's expelled from somewhere every three months . 
  are there any other bans he needs or is he done with now ? 
  http://i.imgur.com/omr3dsc.png not so bad i think . 
  i clicked wrong on nigeria/niger because i tried going too quickly . 
  and your chocolate . 
  of course not , but it 's still the removal of someone 's ( often someone else 's ) body part with no ( immediate ) medical reason . 
  except haircuts and other kinds of shaving . 
  and cutting nails too , i guess . 
  in switzerland people kept asking me how i was , and it took me a while to realise that they were n't actually interested in my long-winded responses as to how i * actually * was . 
  even discounting the fact that it just became independent , it 's probably the least developed country in the world . 
  getting anything in and out of there ( information included , i can only imagine ) is really difficult . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14069082  unlike the predominantly muslim population of sudan , the south sudanese follow traditional religions , while a minority are christians . 
  beats me . 
  actually , christians and muslims are both in minority in south sudan . 
  below 0.2 million euro per square kilometer . 
  it 's nice for once to see a dataset topped by the usual statistical punching bags , so to speak . 
  probably because there are n't very many other norwegian neo-nazi musicians recently arrested in france . 
  i 'll be pulling for iceland now . 
  no question about it . 
  yeah , but ancestry is n't a black-white thing . 
  i have norwegian , swedish and polish ancestry , and probably quite a few others as well . 
  many of those with english ancestry have others , too ( german , french , scandinavian , italian ... ) . 
  this makes it really hard to compare numbers . 
  the map does n't mention anything about `` permanent '' . 
  more than just eu and norway . 
  turkish , albanian and icelandic ports are also there , as well as what i can only assume is basel . 
  also one in morocco . 
  there are ice hotels in several places , in fact . 
  perhaps , but it 's not a venn diagram ( or it would have to show all possible combinations ) . 
  and yeah , as you know it 's now common to name things after the first person after euler ( and gauss ) to discover them . 
  the application process was suspended , not annulled , i believe . 
  so technically i guess it 's still around , though it 's probably outdated now by a fair margin . 
  but no , we 're not a candidate . 
  [ euler graph ] ( http://mathworld.wolfram.com/eulergraph.html ) ? 
  edit : after some research , turns out you mean * diagram * . 
  yeah , flames are pretty hot , it turns out . 
  that 's 44 tons of 500 euro notes , about half the capacity of a boeing 747 . 
   polls close at 17:00 cet ( 16:00 bst ) for maximal pedant points , 17:00 cet is actually 17:00 bst . 
  you probably mean cest . 
  just asking since it totally changes the meaning of the sentence . 
  i assume you mean ** a ** few , not just few . 
  in other countries ... 
  this ca n't be right . 
  is n't london supposed to be in the middle of the purple 0 zone ? 
  it 's far from it on this map . 
  the natural eastern boundary of utc is 7.5 degrees east . 
  you can check on a map yourself , it 's definitely west of denmark . 
  ( but yes , it 's east of the netherlands . ), 
  116 for cologne according to [ yr ] ( http://www.yr.no/place/germany/north_rhine-westphalia/cologne/statistics.html ) . 
  norway actually has higher temperature anomaly ( compared to latitudal mean ) than any other place on the planet . 
  yeah , it 's not the terrain , it 's the altitude . 
  i have n't been 5600 meters high , but i 've noticed short breath near 4000 , and i was n't even hiking . 
  i can imagine walking up elbrus is n't precisely a stroll in the park , although with cable cars there you can probably relax the safety a bit . 
  i actually have a friend who climbed it . 
  maybe i 'll ask him for opinions . 
  the highest peaks in countries are very often at the borders , and nobody seems to mind . 
  this does n't seem so different . 
  most european eurovision video : http://youtu.be/32lpdfs7rpm, 
  `` structural damage plan diplomat '' ? 
  * danuta maria h\u00fcbner ( poland , 87 % ) * centre d\u00e9mocrate humaniste ( belgium ) , fine gael party ( ireland ) and national movement for stability and progress ( bulgaria ) , all 80 % . 
  * group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ( 73 % ) but my lawd , this site is slow as shit . 
  right , sorry . 
  they 're group pictures and it was fairly crowded , so it 's not exactly prime photography . 
  http://imgur.com/a/zxpw3 the princess is the lady holding the right side of the banner on the first picture . 
  the hereditary prince is the bloke under the umbrella on the second ( those umbrellas are the shit , i recommend them as a souvenir , get them from the vaduz tourist office -- mine can stop the niagara ) . 
  the old guy in the back of the last pic is the prince . 
  he was having a grand old time and was the easiest of them to approach . 
  ( also , bonus weird face lady . ), 
  i went to the national day in 2010 and got photos with the whole royal family . 
  a pretty chill bunch . 
  i 've done parties like this before , and it usually ends right around the time the surstr\u00f6mming comes out . 
  war tends to reduce happiness , however . 
  might end up with a net loss . 
   sp - senterpartiet this is the one google translate likes to call `` q '' by the way . 
  at least here . 
  i prefer migros as well . 
  somehow i end up drinking much less ... 
  in fact , nobody does . 
  nynorsk is strictly written . 
  pension fund ( at least it was in 2011 ) , although that classification is a bit wobbly . 
  you should check out the cruise show . 
  http://www.nrk.no/hurtigruten/?lang=en it 's not as speedy though . 
  but that would imply that if all members of / r/europe are subscribed to / r/worldnews ( for example ) , then the / r/worldnews part is the whole pie , so * none * are subscribed to any other subreddits . 
  well , the swedish one does . 
  at least by name in the louise ahlen version , and if not , then i guess in spirit .
