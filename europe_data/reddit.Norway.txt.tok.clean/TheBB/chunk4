  there are no elk ( cervus canadensis ) in europe , although moose ( alces alces ) in europe are sometimes called eurasian elk . 
  applied maths , but eth zurich is pretty solid in most technological fields . 
  i 'll be happy to help , i 've given advice to all the swiss iaeste interns who travel to norway . 
  norwegian in switzerland here . 
  ( trondheim to zurich )  how difficult was learning the language ? 
  german is not a problem , swiss german is another thing entirely . 
  the biggest problem is that my workplace and social circle are pretty much strictly english speaking . 
  ( i do know my fair share of swiss people , i just generally meet them with other foreigners . ), 
   any hostility ? 
  not outright , but i do sometimes feel like the alien . 
   do you feel integrated ? 
  do you have a timeline on when you will ? 
  no , and i will probably leave switzerland before then . 
  although , actually , the foreign population of zurich is so large that integration is almost a non-issue here . 
   how is your new country better/worse than your old one ? 
  switzerland is similar to norway in many respects , being extremely well-developed european nations outside the eu , with high wages and prices and a tourism focus on nature . 
  there is a certain social conservatism here that i do n't much care for , but i believe it 's less pronounced in romandie ( and if i knew a smidgeon of french i would n't mind moving there at all ) . 
  there 's a smashing public transport system . 
  switzerland is also much more crowded , which i do * not * like . 
  overall i think i prefer norway , but i could live quite happily here too . 
   are you planning to settle ? 
   how difficult was it to gain employment in your new country ? 
  pretty easy , that 's the reason i came here actually . 
  i did n't decide to go to switzerland before getting a job . 
   any things you wish you knew before you left ? 
  i had done an iaeste internship here in 2007 . 
  they gave me all the info i needed that time , and coming back went smoothly . 
   is the quality of life better in you 're new one ? 
  yes , but only because i went to switzerland after graduating . 
  since i have a job now , it 's not exactly surprising . 
  if i had stayed , my quality of life would also have been better . 
  and get rid of that apostrophe for crissakes . 
   do you find the culture overwhelming ? 
  not so long as the crowds are small , then it 's manageable . 
  that could just be introverted me speaking , however . 
   how difficult was/is it making new friends ? 
  since i had contacts with iaeste it was not very hard to at least make acquaintances . 
  it would have been considerably more difficult if i had gone it all on my own ( i would probably have stayed within the circle of colleagues ) . 
   what 're your future plans ? 
  i will find a job somewhere after i get my ph.d. 
  exactly where , i do n't know . 
  it 's entirely possible that i stay here , but i would also like to go home , or to my girlfriend in the netherlands ( which is even more crowded , yelp ) . 
   what were your reasons for moving ? 
  i was recommended a ph.d. from a more prestigious or foreign university . 
  yes , they 're in sweden and denmark , too . 
  i think that 's the extent of their european business . 
  i guess the french just consider themselves to be perfect in addition to having the superior culture , so they could n't answer yes ( logical people , as they are ) . 
  we have a book at home dedicated to soviet jokes . 
  it 's hilarious . 
  in eu *, 
  looks very alpine/bavarian . 
  not very representative for a large part of germany i think . 
  it kind of just ... happens . 
  at least in norwegian , they almost always end up masculine . 
  actually , they 're not precisely the same . 
  cvs are longer and more detailed than resumes . 
  presumably they ca n't take it `` back '' to sweden ( a bit of a misnomer since it was never * in * sweden ) . 
  that would definitely violate his will , considering it says expressly that it should be awarded by `` a committee of five persons to be elected by the norwegian storting '' ( translated from `` ett utskott af fem personer som v\u00e4ljas af norska stortinget '' ) . 
  two a week , actually . 
  good point , i do n't know why i missed that . 
  also the ordering is only alphabetical under the primary ordering of eu members first , nonmembers last . 
  what 's similar , except for the shape ? 
  they 're used in different languages and have different names . 
  the greek alphabet has a symbol shaped like an e ( called epsilon ) , and the latin alphabet has a symbol shaped like an e ( called various things in different languages , but never an epsilon ) . 
  there 's really no reason to identify them with each other , especially since the latin small e is e , and the greek small epsilon is \u03b5 . 
  in unicode , the greek epsilon is u +0395 ( greek capital letter epsilon ) and the latin e is u +0045 ( latin capital letter e ) . 
  there is also u +0415 ( cyrillic capital letter ie ) which is also usually styled the same way . 
  a bit of a stretch with greece , do n't you think ? 
  where is the greek e in the latin alphabet ? 
  ( yes , i know it * looks * like the latin e , but they * are n't * the same . ), 
  i 've yet to see the location of these volcanoes on a map . 
  that i would really like to see . 
  the italian re 460 is used heavily in switzerland , and it runs like clockwork , like so much else in this country . 
  it 's not like it never gets cold here , and it 's not like italy does n't have snow either . 
  the new loans have different terms . 
  it 's called refinancing or restructuring of debt . 
  why , switzerland of course . 
  second best chocolate in europe . 
   next installment will be posted on monday . 
  are we skipping one ? 
  same here , although we 've been having this dubai/uae thing to spice things up a bit . 
  i did n't address the point about the eu planning because i do n't consider that part of the discussion , at least not relevant to the point i was initially making . 
  in fact , most of your post is about stuff i did n't really come here to talk about . 
  i 'm not here to defend the eu , just to correct a fallacy you appeared to have . 
  so if someone else wants to debate those things with you then they can feel free to do so . 
  but in any case , the eu does publish a [ fair number of documents ] ( http://europa.eu/publications/official-documents/index_en.htm ) , among them [ this one ] ( http://europa.eu/generalreport/pdf/rg2011_en.pdf ) which you might find helpful if you 're interested in keeping track of eu activities . 
   if you have not developed in 40 years , there is something wrong my point with the romania/germany example was that just because you 're a net receiver for 40 years does n't mean you have n't developed . 
  in fact , it does n't even mean that you 've developed less than the contributors . 
  as far as research goes , i am working in research and i know for a fact that professors in my department have received grants from eu bodies . 
  the names escape me at this juncture because i ca n't be arsed to keep up with the nonpersonal e-mails , but it certainly happens . 
  of course we can argue until the cows come home about degrees , whether the eu are spending ** as much ** on r&d as they should , compared to agriculture , and so on , which i 'm not really interested in doing or prepared to do . 
  i was just puzzled at your insistence that longtime net receivers are necessarily `` bad guys '' for lack of a better term . 
  this is n't the case , since even a world with only good guys must have both receivers and contributors . 
  why should there be an upper bound on how long one is allowed to be a receiver ? 
  if the economy grows equally fast everywhere , in romania as well as in germany , then romania will always be a net receiver compared to germany . 
  moreover , this is a zero-sum game , we ca n't ** all ** be contributors . 
  if you had to be a net contributor after 50 years , then 50 years from now countries will be throwing money into a hole because nobody can accept them . 
  it does n't make mathematical sense for every country to outperform the average of all the other countries . 
  let 's look at a [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gzzokqg.png ) of a typical distribution of wealth that i put together . 
  the horizontal dashed line represents the mean , and anyone to the right of the vertical dashed line will be a net contributor , and those on the left will be a net receiver .
