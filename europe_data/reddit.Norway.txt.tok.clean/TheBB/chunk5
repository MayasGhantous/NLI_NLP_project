  it 's perfectly natural to have fewer contributors than receivers . 
  ( it has nothing whatever to do with being the united states of europe . ), 
  in fact it aids your case just to count countries , but would n't population be a more sensible measure ? 
  the population of the net contributing countries is something like 316 million . 
  the total population of the eu is about 504 million . 
  now the balance looks completely different . 
  thing is , letters are n't vowels or consontants , but sounds are . 
  all the other letters only represent sounds which are either vowels or consonants ( one for each letter ) , the only exception being y , which can represent sounds of both kinds . 
  it is not entirely right to say that y is a vowel , a consonant , or that it is both . 
  i do n't recall . 
  yes , but that was definitely intended . 
  some such cartoons had been printed in norwegian papers as well . 
  you edited that in a few seconds after you posted . 
  if i had been from troms\u00f8 i would have said `` where i grew up the sun would never rise at all in winter '' instead of what i actually said . 
  nah , not that extreme . 
  that 's north of the arctic circle so they have days with no sun whatsoever . 
  i would have said that instead . 
  i 'm from trondheim . 
  go to school , pitch darkness . 
  leave school , much the same . 
  where i grew up the sun would rise at about 10:30 and set at 13:30 . 
  this was so confusing to me at first . 
  bacalao in norwegian refers to a very specific dish , while portuguese seem to use it for a whole variety of dishes ( neither of which is the norwegian one ) , or the fish product itself . 
   their cuisine is extremely different from other mediterranean food well , they are n't strictly speaking mediterranean either . 
   not spain and do n't like it if you talk spanish to them `` because it 's more or less spain '' , they are n't even in the same time zone ( which is a little bit crazy ... come on guys ! ), 
  if anything , it 's spain that 's off . 
  maltese have the most amazing english accent i 've ever heard . 
  there are certain [ criteria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copenhagen_criteria ) that must be met for eu membership . 
  democracy and human rights among them . 
  [ ] ( / ajhappy ) you mean `` fancy , '' i 'm sure . 
  i was wondering that too . 
  what reaction ? 
  there 's no reaction , barely even any faces in the picture . 
  it does . 
  takes two keystrokes though .

  [ us international ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:kb_us-international.svg ) is where it 's at . 
  germany . 
  i 'm not very keen on the culture of fear they seem to be growing over there in the uk . 
  from what i read , norway was close to landing this deal a few years back before liu xiaobo won the peace prize . 
  they did n't take too kindly to that and negotiations broke down . 
  biologically speaking ? 
  at birth there are about 105 boys to every 100 girls ( or so i hear , anyway ) . 
  of course men generally live shorter , so you would expect the population as a whole to be shifted a little bit towards the girls . 
  the cia factbook operates with a 2011 estimate of 1.01 men to every woman . 
  * today * it does . 
  up to now it sure was miserable . 
  works fine in libreoffice . 
  you do n't need excel . 
  norweigan [ national anthem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xtatlzxexe ) and [ royal anthem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6n20ukhpu ) . 
  if you 've ever been here on may 17 or played in a marching band you will be sick of [ this song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umy-lb7expq ) , but there are some more [ exciting versions ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tky0fv6_y7e ) . 
  [ national hymn ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxvrqnu7ag ) . 
  on the whole , not particularly exciting . 
  :-| oh , ca n't forget the football songs : [ a ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgqcmg5qibw ) and [ b ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6cn8gfiz90 ) . 
  while i 'm here i have to mention my favourite : [ til ungdommen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irfb9gudjpe ) . 
  it 's not strictly patriotic for norway , but i guess it fits the bill . 
  [ another favourite . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dtlr4ytatk ), 
   in the picture it looks like the ball representing germany is about 3 or 4 times larger than the one of greece it appears very clear to me that the german ball is much larger than the greek . 
  it 's obvious that area is the guiding factor , not linear size , as is the case with every single such representation ( * except * github 's [ punchcard graph ] ( https://github.com/thebb/aligulac/graphs/punch-card ) , which annoys me to no end ) . 
  i do n't think this is misleading at all . 
  well , it 's a map of what people in the eu think of the eu . 
  anyway , the legend says that it shows the percentage of people who say the eu is good * minus * the percentage of people who say it 's bad ? 
  can i just say what an absurd measure that is ? 
  so if 51 % are in favour and 49 % are against , it will show 2 % ? 
  makes reading this map a bit of a landmine . 
  would i lie to you has me rolling around the floor several times . 
  imo it 's much better than qi . 
  edit : on the whole , i must say i think qi is overrated . 
  as a non-native english speaker it is difficult for me to understand fry . 
  i do n't have a problem with him in anything else he 's done , curiously enough . 
  he does n't let the panel go off on tangents as much , in favour of facts which honestly are n't that interesting . 
  countries send like 5-6 contestants to the imo , it 's not an average . 
  counts people in education looking for a job . 
  are n't they actually swedish though ? 
  it might , but it 's not undemocratic to make mistakes . 
  parties can hold talks with whomever they please . 
  if sd wants more influence they can either soften their policies enough for another party to want to cooperate with them , or simply get more voters . 
  it does n't matter if you 're the largest party if all the other parties are larger as a whole and want nothing to do with you . 
  it 's a mistake , perhaps , but well within the bounds of democracy . 
  interestingly , your post is full of such comparisons . 
  i 've never heard alfakr\u00f8ll , only kr\u00f8llalfa . 
  the post links right to the image , not the imgur page . 
  i went out west , it was brownish in places . 
  it 's from ievan polkka . 
  even i recognize that . 
  i think it 's from the west because that 's where the flanking comes into the picture . 
  i 'm not mad at him , exactly . 
  he can type his comments that way so long as i 'm free to downvote him . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , it 's just jarring to suddenly be exposed to french when i 'm browsing a comment thread . 
  yeah , he posts a translation , but good commenters do n't make their readers work harder . 
  i enjoy languages and multilinguality too , but this really is n't the place or the format . 
  a book where i could only read every other line would n't be interesting . 
  it would just be fucking hard to read . 
  of course this is more about his comments in general than the m\u00e9gathread . 
  one is voiced and the other is unvoiced . 
  hold your fingers on your throat while saying them . 
  you should feel a vibration when pronouncing voiced sounds , but not with unvoiced ones . 
  that 's op 's crosspost . 
  found this caption on a photo .
