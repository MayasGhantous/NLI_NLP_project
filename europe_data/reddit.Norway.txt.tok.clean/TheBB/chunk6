   happy liberation day and veterans day to my norwegian followers . 
  this is the flag i used to wear on my uniform . 
  i used to wear it with pride and i was willing to die for this flag and everything it represents , even on foreign soil and even though norway is n't my country of birth . 
  and i still am , if the opportunity would arise . 
  the reason i have been reluctant to reveal my background , is n't so much because of personal security , but because i know this will create some drama back home . 
  i know my former employer , the norwegian armed forces . 
  wo n't be happy about this , but to be honest , i do n't care anymore . 
  i would n't have gone to the media like i just did , if they had the decency to answere my lawyers calls and not treat me as if i had joined a terrorist group . 
  this is my way of getting some answeres . 
  i 'm also dissapointed that the command of my former unit have told my old colleagues , friends , to break of all contact with me , wich they have . 
  and i know for a fact that certain people in the norwegian armed forces have labeled me as a mercenary . 
  these people should look up that word in the dictonary . 
  i left a well paid job to volunteer here for free , i have spent $ 13,000 of my savings doing so so far , the army is holding back $ 8-9 ,000 they owe me because i 'm with the peshmerga and i have no insurance at all ... if i get injured , i will have to pay for the medical treatment myself . 
  i do n't know if this is a view shared by many or just a few , but that someone thinks i 'm doing this for personal gains , is hurtfull . 
  does n't matter much right now , though . 
  it 's veterans day and i 'm going to spoil myself with the last can of wild tiger i got left and a book i got from one of the guys from the norwegian newspaper i met up with in erbil . 
  fishing regulations is a major point of disagreement both for norway and iceland . 
  it 's a top hit every four years around february or so .

  as far as i can tell you are only * ranked * worse . 
  that does n't mean the numbers themselves are worse . 
  i have german-speaking friends who learned conversational norwegian in three months . 
  makes me envious . 
  i certainly had a tougher time with german . 
  wait . 
  are you trying to tell me everybody 's dead ? 
  i know you can distinguish the breathing patterns of someone who is sleeping and someone who is awake at least . 
  i assume this is not so different . 
  you think that 's bad ? 
  today i was sitting by my usual window . 
  it 's the one right in the front , behind the driver , so there 's a wall in front of me . 
  i sit there because by the time passengers entering through the front door have pocketed their wallet and are looking for seats they have usually walked past this point , so the seat next to me remains free more often . 
  there 's only one button i can conceivably press to signal a stop , and it 's about belly-button height in front of the seat next to me . 
  so this morning , not only does someone sit next to me , he puts his bag on his lap so that it covers the button !, 
  i had to actually excuse myself as i moved his own bag before pressing ... * shudders *, 
  uae is n't on the map . 
  you 're looking at saudi arabia . 
   `` be sure to weigh conflicting armies carefully ! '', 
  it says to weigh conflicting * claims * carefully , which is honestly not such an unreasonable suggestion . 
  as a flag collector , this makes my mouth water . 
  yeah , it 's under heavy load right now i guess . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/snukxe4.jpg ) is what it looks like now . 
  it is i ... leclerc . 
  yes , you can damage your retina , or even go blind in extreme cases . 
  this does n't apply to a total eclipse ( those are fine ) , but since it 's hard to predict when the sun will reappear you 're better off not doing that either . 
  if nothing else , it 's inspired by joik . 
   a corvette is a small warship . 
  it is traditionally the smallest class of vessel considered to be a proper ( or `` rated '' ) warship .

  the whole model is 1.16 km \u00d7 1.16 km . 
  i know you 're not being serious , but ... ;-), 
  this is trampe . 
  it 's in trondheim and is the only one in the world . 
  what are the prevailing winds like in montenegro ? 
  coastal locations with inland prevailing winds are typically a lot colder than those with oceanic winds . 
  almost all of norway gets its weather from the west , originating from warm places in the southern united states , which is why it is so mild compared to places of similar latitude in russia , for example . 
  in fact norway has one of the largest temperature anomalies compared to mean at latitude . 
  people will tell you ( and are telling you ) that the major contributing factor is the gulf stream , but this is a myth . 
  no , the scandinavian elg ( alces alces ) is not the same animal as the american elk . 
  not sure if we have a norwegian name for it . 
  is halloween really that high up ? 
  i 'm still only 30 and easter and nye are orders of magnitude more interesting to me . 
  i ca n't imagine it would be different for people who are older . 
  bless the portuguese , seriously . 
  yeah , screw you pinnekj\u00f8tt-eating half . 
  most `` traditional `` norwegian cuisine is just accidental byproducts of having to come up with creative ideas on how to store things for a really long time , e.g. 
  fermented ( rakfisk ) , salted to death ( pinnekj\u00f8tt ) , or dried and revived with lye ( lutefisk ) . 
  i see \u00d8st-tr\u00f8ndelag made it in . 
  nice . 
  oppland is drunk . 
  well , the british ones look packed too . 
  it 's good , but russia has one of the strongest literature histories of any country . 
  surely books like * anna karenina * and * the brothers karamazov * deserve mention . 
  * some * are , anyway . 
  that list does n't contain all the chains on op 's map . 
  do they call it their `` duty to the party ? '', 
  the front fell off .

  i 've always heard this one with `` and a virgin '' added . 
  tip for you . 
  much of this is accurate . 
  so many swedes have become naturalized norwegian citizens lately ( who can blame them ) that the average iq of norwegians has fallen dramatically . 
  honestly , we deserve all the banter we can get right now . 
  i know it 's kind of abstract , but as a norwegian , this gives me the creeps . 
  what is * crude * rate ? 
  does it have to be refined somehow ? 
  that 's what i 'm talking about : funding for research . 
  i wish . 
  try getting politicians to back that with these voters . 
  it 's a shame though because we have large thorium reserves and it could potentially be a big deal . 
  the best japanese restaurant i 've ever been to is in frankfurt . 
  that 's like getting a certificate of participation . 
  denmark did n't have a whole lot of choice in the matter . 
   2 \u2105 of gdp ... that 's the `` care of '' symbol . 
  it depends a lot on how humid it is . 
  but yes , the difference is usually quite noticeable . 
   the first minister said this meant scotland had been put in a ** very , very strong , strong ** position . 
  #  we 'll get a ** very , very , very ** large trade area , ** much , much ** bigger than the european union . 
  someone get these people a vocabulary . 
  more likely about the border dispute in the arctic sea .
