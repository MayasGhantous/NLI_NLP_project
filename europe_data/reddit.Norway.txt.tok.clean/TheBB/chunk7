  the svalbard treaty is quite restrictive for norway and i think russia is fine with it . 
  at least they signed the treaty . 
  that dispute has been settled , for the record . 
  http://eu-arctic-forum.org/allgemein/delimitation-agreement-a-new-era-in-the-barents-sea-and-the-arctic/ not super happy with the outcome , i guess that might make me an imperialist . 
  3000 and 2000 meters is n't much different when you build lifts to get up there anyway . 
  i might take you more seriously if you had any accomplishments in a sport where gravity does n't do all the hard work for you . 
  so cute to see sweden going on about mountains and you going on about coastline . 
  it says right there in the picture that the uk has 2.5 % , not 1.4 % . 
  where did you get your title from ? 
  are you sure you 're not looking at the hungary slice ? 
  non-martial fertility must be the percentage of births occuring in peacetime then ? 
  yes , landslides , quick clay slides and avalanches make up most of the rest . 
  the mountainside you 're thinking of remarkably did n't collapse and the movement subsided , but it seems to be threatening to fall every autumn as it rains the most . 
  we have relatively frequent floods in norway . 
  it 's just about the only kind of natural disaster we have to worry about . 
  would have liked to see the specifics here . 
  summer anywhere else does n't feel quite as amazing as it does in scandinavia . 
  if it 's milk based , there 's a fair chance it 's french . 
  recent manual cars will suggest a gear to you , so you wo n't be able to escape that for much longer . 
  i prefer the eidsvoll oath myself . 
   united and loyal until the mountains of dovre crumble, 
  presumably you could walk safely on the streets of turkey , a country that respects human rights and democracy . 
  i believe you have mirrored the names . 
  either that , or the us secretary of defense is wearing russian military effects . 
  also i ca n't find any references to itgen grachov . 
  do you mean [ pavel grachev ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/pavel_grachev ) ? 
  few people here would agree that fosen is in northern norway . 
  this is from flat\u00e5sen , actually . 
  but there 's definitely snow in the city . 
  i 'm not sure i get the ordering . 
  to be pedantic , the parliament does n't elect the pm either . 
  the monarch does , while the parliament can effectively veto her choice . 
  eh , we can agree on how to * write * it . 
  you can have bergen for free . 
  we 're not using it . 
  what 's that r doing in there ? 
  do n't you learn to write in denmark ? 
  i see you have the weakling version . 
  put a coin in a cup . 
  pour coffee , strong enough that the coin floats . 
  pour moonshine until the coin dissolves . 
  drink . 
  whops , my mistake . 
  but it should be clear where i got it from ... `` sultan '' is literally part of his name . 
  for you , sunshine : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/begum_om_habibeh_aga_khan?oldformat=true, 
  interestingly , yvette labrousse ( miss france ) later converted to islam and married ~ ~ the sultan of egypt ~ ~ a guy called `` sultan '' . 
  she 's better known as [ begum om habibeh aga khan ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/begum_om_habibeh_aga_khan ) . 
  nowhere near that much . 
  earth * does * have terrain features after all . 
  corsica is about 80 km `` wide '' and its highest mountain is about 2.7 km , so you would expect it to have an aspect ratio ( width/height ) of about 30 . 
  from highly accurate eyeball measurements it looks from the picture to have an aspect ratio of ... 2 to 3 or so ? 
  so i 'm guessing an elevation multiplier between 10 and 15 . 
  `` one of your son '', 
  i would expect op to properly word their title . 
  ladder is more precise i think . 
  there 's nothing paradoxical about that , you 'll just not join . 
  went there on the national day a few years ago and got group photos with the whole royal family . 
  there 's an inconsistency between the map and the table , but it should be noted there was a certain outlier event in 2011 that has been affecting safety statistics in norway for a while . 
  those are not percentages . 
  perhaps , but it would n't be impossible to gain karma . 
  you could do that in other , open subreddits . 
   suck it norway you may be good looking , but you are still swedish . 
  let me paraphrase blackadder . 
  sanity_slipping : `` i 'd like to see the finn who could out-drink me ! '', 
  blackadder : `` in finland there are millions of them . '', 
  it 's like a continous comedy show . 
   1954 : office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees and again in 1981 . 
  i doubt it would matter much . 
  it might make us more likely to join , but it would n't tip the scales . 
  here you go . 
  ** arranged marriage is principially legitimate ** cultural minister hadia tajik is of the opinion that arranged marriages are principially just as legitimate as falling in love . 
  but points out that there are great challenges . 
  by helene kleppe , 29.9.2012 10:49 -- principially i think that arranging marriages is just as legitimate as falling in love and getting married that way . 
  however , it involves greater challenges than many norwegian-pakistanis will accept , and it 's quite problematic to arrange a marriage between someone who grew up in norway and one from , say , pakistan . 
  the tradition is closely related to traditional gender role patterns . 
  as a 29-year-old , i do n't imagine this happening for myself , says cultural minister hadia tajik to dn . 
  tajik denies that she is an immigrant hero . 
  she grew up in bj\u00f8rnheimsbygt in rogaland . 
  the tajik family , who ran `` ali groceries '' were the only immigrants . 
  -- growing up in such a small place gave me some norwegian social cultural codes for free . 
  you realise quite quickly that you eat kvikklunsj on a hiking trip , not after eight . 
  but of course , you are different , i felt that , says tajik in the interview . 
  [ translator 's note : this is a recap of an interview in the newspaper dn , not the interview itself . ], 
  it would also help to know what the numbers are . 
  those look like numbers to me . 
  point is , axes are meant for plotting numerical data . 
  it should be clear from the plot how the parties have been placed and what the relationships are . 
  what does it mean that the horizontal distance between d66 and sp is twice that between d66 and pvda ? 
  percentages wo n't tell me anything . 
  this needs numbers the axes as well as sources . 
  norway , meet albania . 
  albiania , norway . 
  you 'll get along fine . 
   and my favourite `` b\u00e6ttre m\u00e6 l\u00e6n aus '' hey , i know a guy wh -- oh ... 
  also : d e d d e. ( that 's what it is . ), 
  or ... six ? 
  this table lists just summer olympics medals , in spite of what it claims . 
  norway has something like twice that number from winter olympics alone . 
  would probably skew the numbers even more . 
  luxembourg is like the only city where someone has tried to rob me .
