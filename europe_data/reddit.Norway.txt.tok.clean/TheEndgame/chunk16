  what do you suggest ? 
  that we just steal their money and give it to the `` common british citizen '' ? 
  i have yet to see that being done anywhere . 
  around 2025 we will have a deficit if we keep welfare spending like we are today . 
  would hate to be the government who would have to do the unpopular but neseccary cuts in welfare . 
  did n't know he was sarcastic sorry . 
  could be for real though . 
  plenty of people think we have permanent snow and ice bears roaming the streets . 
  not really, 
  you know like 70 % of norway is below the arctic circle ? 
  not really . 
  we are kind of shy , but when you get to know us we are very nice . 
  if you believe this is because of the government you are wrong . 
  our economy is affected by exterior conditions . 
  also our economy is going strong aswell as unemployment is low . 
  this will be the case for a long time . 
  just about . 
  [ we have the same purchasing power as an average brit ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=norway&amp;country2=united+kingdom ) . 
  forecasts expect a tiny increase in unemployment and then it will fall again . 
  also gdp growth is decreasing but still pretty high . 
  i would say we are doing pretty good !, 
  not by a lot and it was actually reduced last month . 
  the forcasts expect a small rise and then it goes back down again . 
  you may have paid the social security tax . 
  i am not entirely sure though . 
  i do n't see the reason why you need a lot of tax brackets if most people earn more than that . 
  it would just make the tax system much more confusing . 
  it is progressive though . 
  the average wage in 2012 was 55713 euros so most people pay more than that . 
  from 54000 to 87670 euros you pay 28 % + 9 % 87670 euros and above is 28 % + 12 % also i should add that there is also a social security tax of 7,8 % for employees and 11 % for people who are self-employed . 
  if you earn between 4730 and 54000 euros per year you pay 28 % . 
  in norway it 's 28 % . 
  in other words a little lower than income tax . 
  nah , us norwegians do n't bother to replace asphalt layers . 
  maybe every 10 years or so . 
  if it really needs repair then they just shovel some asphalt in the pothole . 
  it is managable , but you will have less money for other things . 
  if you assume that a household own a car , it can cost around 425 euros per month on car loans . 
  then you will have to add up the cost of petrol , road toll and repairs . 
  it really adds up . 
  it may be that the prices are n't forming a bubble . 
  prices have gone down a few percent the last months , so i think they may stabilize . 
  i should also mention that there are stricts requirements to apply for a mortgage . 
  among them 15 % equity . 
   can you give us some examples of prices of average houses vs the average salary ? 
  the average salary in norway is 56 600 euros before tax . 
  real estate prices varies a lot between cities . 
  in general oslo and stavanger has the highest prices . 
  i would say you will be looking at a house price of between 420 500 - 601 000 euros on average in most larger norwegian cities . 
   are there any mortgage tax deductions available ? 
  yes there is . 
  it is one of the reasons why prices have increased . 
  investing in real estate gives better returns than stocks and other investment options . 
   what is the mortgage interest rate in norway ? 
  it varies from 3,60 % to 5,30 % depending on the bank . 
  pretty sure that is n't the case . 
  real estate prices has risen a lot more than wages , making the average norwegian loaded with debt . 
  it shows the development in the american and norwegian real estate market . 
  adjusted for inflation , from 1890 to 2010 . 
  [ there is no bubble at all in norway ... ] ( http://static.e24.no/drpublish/images/article/2013/12/03/22654896/1/default/2007559.png ), 
  i find it wierd how the right in the u.k are not pro-eu . 
  in norway it 's the opposite . 
  our prisons are so full that we release prisoners early to make space !, 
   why does this matter , the person is going to pay taxes and what if the person getting the job is a naturalised citizen . 
  true , but it 's kind of worrying when swedish youth is flooding over the border to norway to find jobs because there are none in sweden . 
  the free trade in the eu is good . 
  the euro is bad . 
  that is my stance . 
  it just has n't been prioritized . 
  our main industries has always been at the coast , so they have been shipped out by ship . 
  the main reason is still that the labour party which have been in power for most of the years after the war . 
  they looked at cars and roads as a luxury . 
  they made the roads bad on purpose so people would n't use them . 
  i think they realised the importance of road infrastructure in 2005 or something . 
  we have plenty of money to built roads with , but it has only been prioritized in the last decade or so . 
  it may not . 
  but you would expect a minimum standard especially with `` e '' roads which have lots of traffic . 
  the eu has actually critisized norway because our `` e '' roads does n't meet the requirements . 
  do n't forget that norway has a lot of trailer traffic . 
  it makes for a real challenge in the winters when the roads are slippery and narrow . 
  let us take the e10 through northern sweden and norway . 
  it has loads of heavy traffic as it serves as an enterance for goods to northern norway . 
  [ e10 in sweden ] ( https://maps.google.no/?ll=67.795839,20.594216&amp;spn=0.07629,0.338173&amp;t=h&amp;z=12&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=67.795839,20.594216&amp;panoid=sygz26a_3jzdqzf4wpdzlg&amp;cbp=12,175.93,,0,7.77 ) [ e10 in norway ] ( https://maps.google.no/?ll=68.475894,17.739772&amp;spn=0.037033,0.169086&amp;t=h&amp;z=13&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=68.475894,17.739772&amp;panoid=doeuxgthcgbd0ffshjod5q&amp;cbp=12,248.96,,0,7.58 ), 
  well you can compare it to any country which have had planned economies . 
  when they have gone capitalist the countries and its people have become much richer . 
  china is a perfect example where capitalism raises poor people out of poverty and into the middle class . 
   do you need more ? 
  norway is 5 million inhabitants country and your second city seems to be very small . 
  yes we need more . 
  the road network is slowly being upgraded but it takes its time . 
  bergen and stavanger lies in an area with approx 1 million people and they are not connected by a motorway . 
  you would never see anything like that in the rest of europe . 
  the road between oslo and bergen has lot 's of trailer traffic because of the railway being too unreliable . 
  imagine having meeting trailers in the middle of the winter in a small road where it 's usually slippery . 
  [ here is a rural road in sweden for comparison . 
  ] ( https://maps.google.no/?ll=66.834312,21.751293&amp;spn=0.079415,0.338173&amp;t=h&amp;z=12&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=66.834312,21.751293&amp;panoid=derknxgizgqnbxygefkskw&amp;cbp=12,103.73,,0,12.34 ), 
  the first one seems like a `` good '' road that only needs a new layer of asphalt . 
  in norway the roads are poorly built from the start . 
  low width , no hard shoulder , lots of bumps when the winter is over . 
  the rest of the videoes you show is not national highways .
