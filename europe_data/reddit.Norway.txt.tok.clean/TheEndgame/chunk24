  norway is the country where they have gotten the most orders from after the u.s. 
  it 's because it is `` cheap '' for such a powerful car . 
  it costs like 500 000 nok and a similar petrol car would set you back almost 1 million nok more . 
  adding to this you get free parking , dont have to pay on toll roads and are able to drive in the bus/taxi lanes on the highway . 
  if you are travelling from oslo to trondheim or kirkenes you are most likely going on a plane because the roads and rail are pretty bad . 
  that is why norway have a 48 million passengers a year going through our airports . 
  in norway you can atleast double the price of everything , including the car . 
  another example : price of chevy camaro in sweden : around 50 800 euros , in norway the same car cost 177 888 euros . 
  yup , that is almost 80k euros in taxes . 
  at the same time we have the worst roads in europe . 
  i know . 
  as someone who lives in northern-norway it 's just accepted . 
  another thing is that a lot of trailers drive out to get fish and it really tears down the roads that are allready shitty . 
  the only place in norway with decent roads is \u00d8stlandet . 
  maybe it has something to do with where the politicians live and where you can get the most amount of voters . 
  also , take a look at this [ article ] ( http://ofv.no/presse_1/artikler_2011/norske_europaveier_oppfyller_ikke_kravene/ ) regarding e-roads . 
  they should n't be called e-roads because of the bad condition they are in . 
  haha , no thanks . 
  but i would trade our roads , 
  i doubt it will happen because our politicians are braindead and do n't see the value of this . 
  it took them 24 years to complete a road that could have been built in 5 . 
  it also cost 7 billion nok more . 
  this is because it is built in several small steps instead of building everything right away . 
  [ meanwhile on the road between the two largest cities in norway . 
  ] ( https://maps.google.no/?ll=59.646924,7.806488&amp;spn=0.189798,0.676346&amp;t=h&amp;z=11&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=59.646924,7.806488&amp;panoid=zsjhljod0uo1_xb4fwqzga&amp;cbp=12,10.7,,0,6.74 ), 
  i do n't think we will join the eu for some time . 
  the resistance is very big and often for no reason . 
  they think that we will become greece or that the eu will steal our oil fund . 
  another thing is that some people want out of the eea aswell . 
  do they really think we will be able to get a better deal outside the eurozone ? 
  true . 
  why not go all in instead of paying the same as other countries without being able to influence the politics . 
  also we get no money from the eu when it comes to infrastructure which we really need . 
  we would keep them regardless , 
  wish we had euros here in norway . 
  it seems so cool to see where all the coins come from !, 
  i do think the transition to more industry will go pretty smooth because of what you say . 
  the other problem at the moment is the high labour costs . 
  this should n't be a problem however if we produce very good products . 
  the biggest problem we have right now is the high amount of public workers . 
  there would be a lot of people who would loose their jobs when the oil money stops pouring in . 
  yeah , it looks really bad in those countries . 
  still we see how norwegian shipyards more often loose contracts to shipbuilders in asia . 
  also remember a lot of our onshore industry is producing products to the petroleum industry . 
  well , norway doesnt really produce anything . 
  just take a look at this [ picture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:norway_treemap.png ) . 
  it reminds me very much of dutch disease . 
  just too bad our government is too doped up on oil that they do n't see the issues with companies fleeing the country . 
  no joke , it cost 351 euros for one year here in norway . 
  that 's what you get for having to pay for 4000 employees . 
  norway has approx 4000 employees in our public broadcasting . 
  yeah , it 's basically a way to keep a low unemployment rate ... 
  in norway we also experience corruption and our current government have had some nasty cases . 
  - we had a politician from the sosialist left party who gave a lot of money to the youth section of their own party . 
  - our industry minister from the labour party gave lots of top jobs in state owned companies to friends . 
  - our main labour union 's leader got a place in the council for the company kongsberg gruppen asa ( a mayor state owned company ) which he got 17000 euros even though he did n't show up at the meetings . 
  this was the man who was going to represent the average worker !, 
  they have gotten a new leader , but she has already made a horrible first impression !, 
  still this does n't stop us from voting in the same people we hate ... 
  we have to take advantage of it , it 's the first time in my entire life that we have had so many consecutive days with 20 + degrees . 
  we have also had the most snow ive seen this winter . 
  for someone like me who lives on the coast this climate reminds me of inland conditions . 
  usually we have winters with around -5 to -10 degrees and summer between 10-20 degrees . 
  in the inland it is however pretty common with winter temperatures down to -30 and summers with up to 25 degrees . 
  i think many people would be suprised that we have 20 + weather in the summer so far north !, 
  looking at the forecasts it looks like it will go back to more normal temperatures this week . 
  today it was 26c where i live and it 's going to be 24c tomorrow , then it will start to get colder . 
  my thoughts go out to all the people here in northern norway who has gone on vacation to southern europe where it is colder than here !, 
  the link is in norwegian and it works fine on a computer . 
  you can find the original link [ here ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/karasjok-varmest-i-europa-7217582.html ) . 
  haha , i though you guys knew that fahrenheit is pretty much non-existent outside the u.s. 
  it 's pretty impressive with 34c/93f above the arctic circle do n't you think ? 
  the same in nothern norway and it has been like this almost every day since the 17th of may . 
  you almost get tired of all the sun , in the start of may there was snow on the ground ffs !, 
  the point is that no system is perfect . 
  it may look good from the outside , but on the inside it may not be such a success story . 
  of course the pay is better here as in most of the sectors . 
  but the fact is that our healthcare system is n't as good as people say it is . 
  many patients are having their treatment in germany or denmark , our health minister uses private health care . 
  it 's ridicolous . 
  here are some examples : [ 1 ] ( http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10068950 ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10068780 ) [ 3 ] ( http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10045378 ) [ 4 ] ( http://www.vg.no/helse/artikkel.php?artid=10066845 ) i can dig up even more if you are interested . 
  norway has the same problems with our public health care system so you are wrong on that one . 
  doctors are complaining on to much paperwork , management is horrible and long waiting lists to name a few . 
  it 's not that bad in the summer . 
  i live in northern norway and right now it is clear blue sky and almost 20c !, 
  wish we would do it too . 
  but instead our roads are an absolute embarrassment . 
  i would say at the pumps it 's our governments that are milking us the most . 
  thank you , 
  i think it 's fair to label them as such considering they are the only party in norway that has that as one of their main policies . 
  not that there is anything wrong with that . 
  you are right that they are not the same as sd and the likes , but in comparison to the other parties they are the go to party if you want less immigration . 
  if there is anyone that is experts at excess planning it 's the labour party . 
  i would take it with a grain of salt . 
  but you need to remember that we need 5-10 years of planning before we can put the shovel in the ground and start building one of them . 
  and that is an optimistic estimate . 
  over here rimi is loosing billions every year . 
  they used to be the prefered retail chain , but then the swedes took over and crashed it to the ground . 
  here in norway we are told to prepare for tougher times even though the unemployment rate is 3,7 % and may rise to around 4 % at most ... 
  we actually have an anti-immigration party in government and are still number one .
