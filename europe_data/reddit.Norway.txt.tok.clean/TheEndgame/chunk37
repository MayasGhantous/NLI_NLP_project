  buying a 4th gen fighter over 5th gen when it 's available is just plain stupidity . 
  i 'm glad we bought the f-35 . 
  even though it may have some problems in the beginning , which is expected on a brand new airplane . 
  getting paid 1570 $ per month in countries that are much cheaper than here is very tempting indeed !, 
  in other words making it more undemocratic than it is now ? 
   what would a perfect eu look like a free trade agreement . 
  that 's it . 
  going on erasmus next year . 
  will i get a baby from it ? 
  looks like things are looking brighter for spain . 
  need to get that unemployment level down though !, 
   if switzerland has a high number of millionaire household you got ta wonder how the rest are doing , when 50 % of swiss adults have 95.000 usd or less after debt . 
  [ why not look at financial wealth instead ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult#list_of_oecd_countries_by_financial_wealth_per_adult.2c_2011 ) ? 
  you know , what people have in the bank and is able to use as opposed to wealth that might as well be the result of a housing bubble ( see australia ) . 
  as long as it 's dark and clear skies you have a good chance of seeing it . 
  october to march is the best time . 
  why would n't they support it ? 
  for eastern european countries it 's pretty much guaranteed a good thing as they will end up getting way more eu funds than what they contribute . 
  october and november is pretty hit and miss . 
  at that time you risk pretty hefty storms . 
   how ? 
  average joes still has to be able to buy all the stuff to live and most average jobs simply do n't create enough wealth to pay for that . 
  they have no problem paying for basic living expenses . 
  cost of living here in norway is slightly lower than in switzerland , yet literally no onet has any problem paying for living expenses . 
   you see the same thing in luxembourg where a lot of regular people drive to neighbouring countries just to be able to afford the stuff they need to live . 
  how is this an argument ? 
  if you can buy things cheaper abroad of course you do it . 
  it 's very common for us norwegians to drive to sweden or finland to buy cheaper goods , but that does n't mean we ca n't afford to pay for the same stuff over here . 
  or else people in western norway would have starved to death !, 
   swiss are n't even trying to be rich as it looks like :  but you said billionaires does n't matter for the average joe ? 
  [ better look at amount of ultra-high net worth households !, 
   who cares about absolute wages if you ca n't buy anything with them ? 
  how do you end up with this conclusion ? 
  they have the highest purchasing power in europe . 
  they can buy more than anyone else in europe . 
   great a lot of millionairs move to switzerland to save taxes like michael schumacher that really helps the average joe . 
  getting millionaires to spend money in your country definately helps the average joe . 
  why are germans so jealous of the swiss ? 
  does it feel so bad to be poor ? 
   if you account for debt and remove all the michael schumachers who live in switzerland , but are n't actually swiss and just want to save taxes the median swiss person is n't actually that well off . 
  [ 12,7 % of swiss households are dollar millionaires ] ( https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/financial_institutions_business_unit_strategy_global_wealth_2014_riding_wave_growth/?chapter=2#chapter2_section3 ) . 
  [ even in service jobs the median pay is 4500 chf a month for women \\ ( 4325 eur \\ ) and 5500 chf ( 5285 eur ) for men ] ( http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/03/04/blank/key/lohnstruktur/nach_taetigkeiten.html ) . 
  if you are not well off being paid 4325 eur a month in a no skill job then germany must be african tier poor in comparison . 
  in absolute numbers they are nearly double . 
  when adjusted for purchasing power it will of course be different . 
  the swiss are still richer than people from luxembourg . 
  is this so hard to accept ? 
  if you look at the last link you will see that wages more than make up for it . 
  hard choice , but i think reine is hard to beat .

  [ median wage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage ) [ average wage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) [ comparison between switzerland and luxembourg ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=luxembourg&amp;country2=switzerland ) . 
  wages in switzerland is 78 % higher than in luxembourg . 
  wages are like twice as high compared to germany . 
  wages in switzerland are actually nearly double that of those in luxembourg . 
  hardly just as rich . 
  or norway where you do n't have to pay 50 % income tax , 
  switzerland is the best country in europe by far . 
  people are just jealous . 
  i think we have a similar rule here in norway . 
  you basically can pay large amounts with cash , but you need to have the papers in order from where you have gotten them . 
   how does it work ? 
  do n't know to be honest . 
  probably a database or that the business sector is tied to the account . 
   does it have a built in database of all major stores ? 
  it does n't matter if it 's small or large . 
  it categorizes anything from the large carrefour store i visited in poland to the small local shop in the village near my home town . 
  it does n't matter if it 's in norway or abroad either . 
  really cool system . 
   it would n't work in my case , since i do most groceries at a local mini turkish supermarket . 
  do n't know about that . 
  some transactions are of course not there , but those are easy to manage . 
   it would be nice to have this kind of system at my own bank . 
  i currently have nice excel sheet that does the same , but with manual input . 
  a lot of time that could have been used for other things !, 
   does it automatically sort all the transactions ? 
  yep , i have some examples here from last month . 
  here i have a general [ overview ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qbfrgfp.png ) of income and expenses sorted by category . 
  then i can enter one category , like for example [ groceries ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lt2g3sg.png ) . 
  here i get a list over what stores grocery stores i have spent money in . 
  and if i press on one of the stores it gives me a list of every transaction in that store . 
  super easy and practical . 
  how the does that even work ? 
  dealing with hundeds of thousands in cash must take a lot of time and effort . 
  seems like `` rest of europe '' is a heaven for criminals if this is the case . 
  no need to launder money . 
  ca n't say the quality of the tunnels are great either . 
  they 're being upgraded at the moment though . 
   do you never buy stuff at a market or second hand ? 
  using a card in a bar is also a really big hassle , because it takes way longer then handing over some bills . 
  i rarely buy stuff at the market since they are not very common here . 
  as far as i know most of them have card readers as well . 
  if i buy stuff second hand i just transfer the money electronically . 
  no problem using card in bars either . 
  just dealing with cash is annoying and takes longer time when the price is not round . 
   there are places where electronic payment is better and there a places where cash works much better .
