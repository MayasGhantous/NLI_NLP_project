  thats why it is best to keep both . 
  ca n't think of any place where cash is better . 
  except illegal transactions . 
  here every store goes to the bank with the surplus cash the next day and deposit it . 
  try to pay an institution or business with the same amount in cash and i 'll guarantee you that they will become suspicious . 
  stores over here are required to notify the authorities if you pay with large amounts of cash . 
  that 's the argument i have for banking electronically . 
  my bank even has an option for budgeting where you can see what money you have used on different services . 
  food , clothers , transport etc. 
  we have strong consumer protection laws here . 
  not to mention we do indeed have a large amount of trust for eachother . 
  too bad for the bank as they loose a lot of money by loosing their trust from the customer . 
   what is wrong with the idea of having both side by side ? 
  it 's more the fact that when over 90 % of the population does n't use cash the extra cost of catering to those who do just is n't worth it . 
  i know literally no one here in norway who exclusively use cash for payments . 
  even my grandma only use card when she is shopping . 
  i remember working at a grocery store and dealing with cash is such a hassle compared to electronic payments . 
  i think a lot of time and resources could be used better by having a cash-free society . 
   if power or internet or even the banks servers go down , you ca n't buy food or anything . 
  cash always works . 
  most stores here shut down when there is a power outage . 
  for accounting reasons everything is recorded electronically anyways . 
   this is the estimated cost of five bridges , a tunnel and a stretch where they havent decided what to build . 
  \u00a8 that is the cost for the entire thing including motorway on all stretches . 
  we have the money , just go ahead . 
  too bad politicians want tolls to finance it making a previously good investment a bad one . 
   it 's easy to hate an argument when you do n't understand the point of it . 
  it 's not a good argument when politicians and the state budget have told us for years that the reason for bad roads in norway is not the landscape , but because politicians simply have n't prioritized it . 
  not to mention cars have been called a `` luxury '' item for years making politicians ignore roads to somehow get us to use it less . 
  i am aware of this . 
  the point is that it should have been done years ago . 
  because anything right of centre in politics is taboo on this site . 
  objectivly this is by far the best infrastructure minister we 've had by far . 
  you may not agree with everything the party stands for , but give credit where it 's due . 
  it 's like you say only a real problem if you go away from eastern norway . 
  i now live here in the east and it 's amazing how much of a difference there is . 
  i guess the people in the north and west are very patient people to be content with the situation . 
   where in norway is the first example from ? 
  from helgeland south of saltfjellet . 
  it must be said that the road is in the process of being upgraded , but it 's not done until 2018 or something . 
   we are in a period where there is a shift from building cities and infrastructure to suit cars ( which has been the case from 1965 -  today ) , to building cities and infrastructure to suit people and transit . 
  but why is there parts of the main road between the two largest cities in norway not wide enough for a yellow line ? 
  that 's the least you could expect ... 
   i 've travelled extensively in finland and sweden and the roads are n't that good here either when you get to the roads that just support local people . 
  the e10 through northern sweden is great i must admit !, 
  classic case of `` you do n't know what you have until it 's gone '' . 
  i 've heard danes , germans and brits complaining about their roads and i just have to laugh . 
  never experienced any bad roads in those countries . 
  not in poland either i should mention . 
   this sounds cool , what would you say is the minimum wage in your country ? 
  for people over 18 i would say around 147 nok ( 12,7 # ) / hour since that is what year are entitled to at a grocery store . 
  for people under 18 it 's usually around 100 nok ( 8,65 # ) / hour . 
  the lowest wage i 've heard someone get while over 18 was 130 nok ( 11,25 # ) / hour but she was a waitress so she probably got some tips in addition . 
   do you think the unions are ever disruptive ? 
  not really since employers and trade unions are generally pragmatic . 
   what happens when an industry dies and people need to be fired because it is not cost effective any more ? 
  that 's kind of what is happening now that the oil price has been cut in half . 
  the response from the unions are a general real wage freeze for workers in the oil and gas sector . 
  if the industry is doing bad it 's not much the unions can do to people getting fired . 
  usually the previous employer will try to help them get a new job . 
  on the upside traditional exports are booming because of a week currency so workers in these industries can expect a pay rise . 
   for example what do you think will happen when automation takes most jobs ? 
  i have no idea . 
  employment levels are high and unemployment are low at the moment so i do n't think they have given it much thought . 
  it 's not cheap by all means , but we manage . 
  i agree it was n't the best example . 
  [ but what about the e39 between bergen \\ ( 275 112 inhabitants \\ ) and stavanger-region/haugesund ( population 242 264 ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t9jtfu6.jpg ) ? 
  the roads around oslo are great , but only there . 
  like you said the usd has strenghten a lot . 
  so if you go to a bar you now pay $ 10 for a beer . 
  in the store i costs between 3-4 dollars . 
  so for americans wanting to visit norway , now is the time to do it . 
  it 's 30-40 % cheaper than it used to . 
  they have done great when it comes to infrastructure so far . 
  [ a good summary can be found here ] ( http://www.solvikolsen.com/2015/05/1355/ ) . 
  i did n't even vote frp and yet they are the ones i have been most impressed by so far . 
  let 's go to a road that is more widely used should we . 
  [ the e16 at sandvika has a traffic of 35 000 cars a day , but is still a two lane road . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/onl6hjw.jpg ) the treshold for building a four lane road is 12 000 vehicles a day if i recall correctly . 
   and why are you on about building controlled-access highways specifically now ? 
  you 're right . 
  it should have been done 40 years ago . 
   you do n't take into account the total length of the roads needed to be maintained compared to population size and how that maintainance compared to the danish climate must be quite a bit higher . 
  if we would have built roads properly they would n't need so much maintenance . 
  [ instead you end up with roads like this after 1 winter ] ( http://bil.aftenposten.no/prodtest/article19332.ece/alternates/w780c169/telehiv.jpg ) . 
  norwegian roads are no buil to stand the winters . 
   and how about tunnels , bridges , mountain roads etc. 
  that are all expensive and challenging in it 's own right . 
  they 're expensive , but if you build one it will stay there for 50-100 years with minor maintenance . 
  previous infrastructure-ministers have all admitted that it 's more fun to open new roads than to maintain what 's already been built . 
  the good thing is that we have finally gotten an infrastructure minister with vision and efficiency . 
  [ polish road ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/a2_\\ ( poland \\ ) _ 3_km_east_of_pozna % c5 % 84_komorniki_interchange . jpg ) [ norwegian road \\ ( main road going between north and south \\ ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sj5bevb.jpg ), 
  i hate this argument . 
  [ actually our geography makes motorways cheaper to build in norway compared to denmark since we do n't have to import the stones needed for the foundation ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/--ikke-dyrere-a-bygge-motorvei-i-norge-enn-i-danmark-6992353.html ) . 
  it 's just a shitty excuse for politicans to not take responsibility for bad infrastructure . 
  they 're there but they are badly maintaned and underdimentioned . 
  the world bank have n't been here apparantly . 
  ports , airports , it-infrastructure and the electricity grid is in good condition , the rest is bad . 
  atleast your roads are superior . 
  here both roads and railways suck .
