  so for an average person that equals around 50 000 - 60 000 nok . 
  so the average monthly wage in the whole year is closer to 31000 + nok . 
  this is a totally liveable wage over here . 
  if you have two earners in your household you can afford a pretty nice home , car and of course vacations !, 
  not even being discussed in norway . 
  i do n't know how reliable numbeo is , [ but here is a comparison ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=norway&amp;country2=switzerland&amp;city1=oslo&amp;city2=zurich ) . 
  prices will of course vary a lot depending on area etc , but this only gives a rough picture . 
  the wages in switzerland are insane if this site is correct though . 
  55200 nok net per month is more than most norwegians earn before tax . 
  so it would n't surprise me if the swiss in the end are better off . 
  if you live in the other cities though it 's easy to get roughly the same wages as in oslo while housing is cheaper . 
  in the end that is where the major differences are . 
  so is the case for any major city . 
  the take home pay in zurich is also madness though . 
  the nok has weakened a lot while the chf has strenghten in the last year so oslo is much cheaper now than it was . 
  2 years ago the prices were roughly similar . 
  if you live here though the prices are n't too bad as the higher wages make up for it . 
  well oslo is cheaper than zurich . 
  so if you earn roughly the same your purchasing power should be higher in oslo . 
  it really depends on what part of the country you are in . 
  from trondheim and further south it 's usually pretty alright , with the oslo area being the best . 
  in the north it 's really bad though . 
  but you are right that we are investing a lot at the moment , but it will still take atleast a decade before the roads are as good as they should be . 
  airports , ports and power grid is good though . 
  but i do n't know how much this matters in this index . 
  if only finland had a floating currency this would n't be necessary . 
  norway on 4th place ? 
  this list is horrible ... 
  [ does n't seem to have impacted unemployment at all ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:non-eu&amp;idim=country:se&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=1147125600000&amp;tend=1447023600000&amp;hl=no&amp;dl=no&amp;ind=false ) ...  if we are in the euro zone , we would have a fixed rate towards our biggest markets , which would make our economy more stable . 
  most exporters/importers already have a fixed rate to a certain degree to avoid the volatility . 
  you still do n't understand the major perk of having an own currency ? 
  being able to set the interest rates yourself . 
  you now have an interest rate of -0,35 % , which is lower than the ecb rate of 0,05 % . 
  your central bank was also fast to start a qe program . 
  something the ecb just did recently , and according to many , way too late . 
  you have a free floating currency so a devaluation will happen somewhat naturally like it has been in your case . 
  also you mentioned that you struggled with a high value currency after the crisis ? 
  [ seems like it was the opposite ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=eur&amp;to=sek&amp;view=10y ) . 
  helped to pull you out pretty well i would say . 
  imagine if your rate was fixed and not allow you to lower your costs compared to the eurozone by 30 % + with little impact on standards of living . 
   i believe that to be false since we had issues with a high valued currency after the crisis , since that made our goods more expensive in the euro zone but you were able to devaluate as you pleased . 
  if you were in the euro you would have no such option . 
  the only way to lower costs would be to do like finland that cut wages . 
  to be fair i highly doubt you would be doing so well economically if you had joined . 
  subway is awesome . 
  prefer it to mcdonald 's and the other fast food chain to be honest . 
  the debt is being paid constantly . 
  some debt will have to be paid the next month , while some are maturing 10 years from now . 
  except the ecb and the fed is n't being run by any of those people . 
  and then we can see that the dollar will not be affected at all so everyone can shut up about the petrodollar bullshit . 
  someone has n't been to vard\u00f8 i see . 
  oslo is actually pretty decent . 
  ruined a little by 60 's architecture , but on the other hand you have nice areas like aker brygge and frogner . 
  pretty doable in norway if you are willing to not live in the city center . 
  in small towns it 's totally normal and i know several people who bought a house at a pretty young age . 
  if that 's true then i do n't know what to say . 
  that 's downright dangerous . 
  do n't know about sweden . 
  but here in norway we actually have to work to own a house and get a good job . 
  one would think that the lack of war and terrorism would more than make up for that . 
  `` i was expecting them to give me a house , a good job , so i could have a better life . 
  this is what i was dreaming about . '' says it all really . 
  same in norway . 
  if you need shelter the government will give it to you . 
  so the only people you see sleeping in the streets are drug abusers . 
  i would welcome the uk in the efta . 
  we need more bargaining power and an ally that shares the same values as us . 
  do n't need the eu for that . 
  scandinavia has had a free movement treaty since the 50 's . 
  i 'm kind of surprised that an otherwise modern country like germany still use cash frequently . 
  i 'm surprised every time i see someone pay with cash over here since it 's so rare . 
  do n't know why you are downvoted when you are correct . . 
  that 's up to the irish . 
  if they do n't want the corporate tax it 's their decision . 
  employees pay tax . 
  not to mention these companies attracts a lot of talented people . 
  meanwhile in northern norway the economy is booming with record exports and a decline in unemployment . 
  also here in eastern norway the economy is doing good overall . 
  it 's very local at the moment . 
  ah , yet we still hear how our economy is going down the drain ... 
  things are more complicated than that . 
  ah , so nothing different in other words ? 
   i doubt it . 
  basic income does n't have to be very different from today 's welfare support . 
  is n't the whole point of basic income that you would cut a lot of bureacracy ? 
  30 % of employees in the nordics are employed in the public sector . 
  i would say that even cutting 10 % of the public workforce would cause a radical change in how the state operates . 
  not to mention it would be horribly unpopular with the unions since their members just lost their job while recieving a hefty pay cut . 
  that 's social issues and not related to basic income which would radically change the way the state works . 
  at least in norway people are really scared to change things . 
  we have a really complicated way of building infrastructure for example but this does n't get changed because `` that 's how things always have been done here in norway '' . 
  basic income would be rediculed here in norway if it were proposed as the mentality of working for your money is very strong . 
  just like in switzerland and germanic countries in general . 
  not going to happen in the nordics first . 
  we are too conservative . 
  it 's kind of like japan . 
  people are fast to use new technology , but major changes to how things have always been done is not popular . 
  smaller town outside of oslo . 
  you make due by not spending money on things you do n't need like having a car for example . 
  rent is cheap where i live and that 's the largest exepense for most people .
