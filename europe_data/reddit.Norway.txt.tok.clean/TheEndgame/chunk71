  cutting down on wages and benefits are in general accepted among unions here if that is what it takes to stay competitive . 
  on the other hand trade confederations are willing to increase wages and benefits if the industry is doing good . 
  in general both are willing to cooperate for the common good . 
  here i must say france has something to learn !, 
  i think a lot of this thinking is a result of people believing that the younger people will end up staying in that flexible job that may not have the best benefits or wages . 
  in the long term i am sure that the younger people will get better jobs , and having that valuable working experience from a young age can prove to be very important . 
  my first job was at a grocery store . 
  sure it was n't the best job , but i am forever thankful for the working experience i got there . 
  i can totally see it being useful when i start applying for jobs when i 'm done studying . 
   for the rest , it ranges between fairly hard and extremely hard . 
  you might get lucky , or have a few internships , or get a short term contract . 
  there are a lot less unqualified jobs in france than in germany or the uk by the way . 
  so in france you pretty much need a degree to get a job ? 
  how about regular blue collar workers ? 
  in regards to unqualified jobs , does this mean that more jobs are automated ? 
  i typically think of typical jobs of this type as cashiers , waiters etc. 
  do you think the lack of these jobs is a result of the strict labour laws ? 
   here you can find some shiny graphs showing how our young people are almost sacrificed . 
  that is pretty bad . 
  is this issue even being discussed ? 
  in norway the youth unemployment rate has reached 11 % and there is already discussions that the government is n't doing enough to reduce it . 
   though it 's hard to just apply what works for you , as a small country with an economy based on export , to a country that has 13 times your population with an economy based on a service industry and that imports more than it exports . 
  uk and the u.s would probably be better comparisons . 
  both have more flexible labour laws and lower unemployment rates . 
  my impression is that france is a great place to work if you have been working in a business for many years . 
  for younger people it seems like it 's much harder to enter the market . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong though . 
  that 's a lot for starting a llc . 
  denmark seems to be doing better and they have very flexible labour laws . 
  that a country that has a such high unemployment rate refuses to do something about it is very interesting . 
  how easy is it for young people to enter the job market in france ? 
   5 million nok for an equivalent 2 bedroom apartment that costs 15,000 nok to rent ? 
  just looking at the internet for ads it looks like the price vary a lot even within one area . 
  but as an example i was thinking about these two objects for comparison . 
  [ rent ] ( http://m.finn.no/realestate/lettings/ad.html?finnkode=75590619 ) vs [ buy ] ( http://m.finn.no/realestate/homes/ad.html?finnkode=76033163 ) . 
  both apartments are in better areas of the city and pretty central . 
  you do of course have more expensive real estate if you live right in the middle of the city centre . 
  for example [ this ] ( http://m.finn.no/realestate/lettings/ad.html?finnkode=76036755 ) one or [ this ] ( http://m.finn.no/realestate/homes/ad.html?finnkode=75089416 ) . 
  these are located in probably the best area of oslo . 
  but compare it to central london for example and they suddenly seem very reasonable . 
  i do however have the impression that people buying flats in oslo actually live in them and not exclusively use them as investments . 
   i 'd have thought average incomes would be far higher in norway , but then again , london is higher than the rest of the uk so maybe the income difference is n't too big between oslo and london . 
  the disposable income is indeed quite a bit higher in norway . 
  according to uk statistics the median household income in the uk was [ # 25 700 ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2015#trends-in-household-incomes ) a year . 
  in norway the same figure is [ # 39 400 ] ( https://www.ssb.no/en/inntekt-og-forbruk/statistikker/ifhus ) ( 478 700 nok ) . 
  the disposable income in oslo is [ 110 % ] ( http://www.ssb.no/en/nasjonalregnskap-og-konjunkturer/statistikker/fnr/aar/2015-10-20 ) of the national average . 
  do n't know the figures for the uk in relation to london however . 
  if you build enough flats then renters will have to lower their prices to be able to get a tenant . 
  having a tenant is better than no income at all . 
  the actual figures are : 15 % of gdp , 20 % of the government 's income and 39 % of exports . 
  the swf is worth approx twice as much as total gdp . 
  considering the wages are higher in oslo it really is n't bad compared to other capitals . 
  there is however a shortage in housing so it should be addressed before it gets too bad . 
  that 's brutal . 
  i guess these high paying jobs in it contributes quite a bit . 
  most people in norway wants to own their own apartments which is one of the reasons i imagine it 's `` cheap '' . 
  there are also strict requirements to get a mortage . 
  so if you are going to pay 5 million nok ( 535 000 $ ) you need 15 % of it in equity beforehand . 
  that means to get a mortage you need to have saved up around 80 000 $ in cash . 
  for people already owning homes this is n't much of an issue , but for newcomers in the market that means 5-10 years of aggressive saving . 
  however if you have dual incomes it should be possible without much hassle . 
  you need to have money saved up and/or work . 
  but if you avoid the larger cities it 's possible to live cheap . 
  i pay 3000 + electricity where i live now . 
  that 's true as well . 
  i believe that if city authorities were better at building public transport this would be less of an issue as you can live outside of the city and commute to the city centre . 
  it 's quite expensive however it 's no problem if you have a regular income . 
   the cities you mention as brig affordable seem quite small they are indeed , but even small cities can be expensive here . 
  troms\u00f8 comes to mind where housing is really expensive . 
  [ a 34m2 apartment in the city centre is listed at 2,2 million ] ( http://m.finn.no/realestate/homes/ad.html?finnkode=75826995 ) . 
  that 's more than my childhood home in a smaller town sold for , and that house was over 200m2 and good standard !, 
   that 's interesting . 
  i guess specifically in that field then ? 
  ( oil or whatever ) yes it 's pretty restricted to that field at the moment . 
  municipalities now have an easier time finding engineers however as they used to struggle earlier . 
  working in the oil industry will basically earn you nearly twice as much as in the public sector . 
   from what i 've heard we generally need pretty much all kinds of engineers here in sweden . 
  i 've heard the same . 
  there are some engineers who are looking at possibilities to work abroad in for example sweden . 
   we are in real need of healthcare workers and teachers for example , but general unemployment levels are still high because people are n't educated for those jobs , or at all . 
  yes healthcare workers have no problems finding jobs here either . 
  looking at the university statistics the nursing studies have had a huge increase . 
  on the other hand barely anyone studies petroleum engineering . 
  do n't know if most do , but quite a large amount do . 
  the pay is very good compared to other sectors . 
  hard to find a job . 
  because of the low oil prices thousands of engineers are now unemployed . 
  keep in mind these are the prices in the best areas of oslo . 
  there are quite a few wealthy people living there which helps push prices up . 
  they are however relatively reasonable in comparison to other major cities . 
  the housing market is in general quite expensive in norway because investing in real estate gives you lower taxes than investing in stocks or funds . 
  secondary real estate is valued at 70 % of the market value in comparison to 100 % for financial equities . 
  in addition norway is filled with nimby 's who are against building higher buildings . 
  in oslo this is quite the problem as people do n't want highrises in addition to keeping the city limits as they are . 
  a few cities have been good at providing affordable housing . 
  skien , porsgrunn and kristiansand comes to mind . 
  in the city centre you will be looking at around 15 000 nok ( 1600 $ ) for a 2 bedroom apartment . 
  oslo has great public transport however so you can live outside of the city centre where the prices are lower . 
  edit : if you are looking to buy you will have to pay between 4-6 million nok depending on area . 
  in oslo you can get an apartment pretty much by the day since there are no rent controls .
