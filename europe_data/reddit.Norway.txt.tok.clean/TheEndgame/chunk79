  social democracy is not really `` sosialistic '' . 
  the scandinavian countries are probably some of the most capitalist countries in europe . 
  there is a significant south-north divide . 
  not to mention the scandinavian countries which interests are more aligned with the u.k. 
  i live in a well insulated building and yet you can just smell the coal in the air . 
  never change silesia . . 
  not really , the road in those picures are too wide compared to norway !, 
  in a few years it will not be a problem i think . 
  all newer cars have dab and in my opinion it is vastly superior to fm . 
  way more channels and you do n't get the annoying static noise . 
  in norway spanking your kids has been illegal for some time and we have a low crime rate . 
  actually the current generation is better than the previous generation in pretty much every aspect . 
  they perform better at school , drink less , have a healthier lifestyle and do less crime . 
  oh , and they have a very good relationship to their parents as well . 
  here it is : http://www.scb.se/sv_/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/amnesovergripande-statistik/namnstatistik/30898/30905/behallare-for-press/397541/# most popular boy name is william and most popular girl name is elsa . 
  what if the eu/nato have different views on russia or china compared to your own country ? 
  based on what ? 
  i would sure as hell choose the u.s over italy if i had to move from norway as the standard of living would be higher . 
  wages and living space is in general much higher in the u.s compared to central europe . 
  i would say that standard of living in the u.s is on a western european level . 
  so much higher than in southern or eastern europe . 
  that 's not true in norway atleast . 
  the state owned companies are pretty greedy . 
  mostly because politicians love the dividends they pay out . 
  if the spanish have n't fished it all up that is . 
  if you did like most of the world you gave the banks a loan that had to be paid back with interest . 
  that 's what happened in norway and the u.s atleast . 
  in a way the tax payers actually profited off it . 
  or when switzerland let go of the euro-peg . 
  or maybe the whole situation is blown out of proportion and stockholm actually is safe ? 
  i 've never once felt unsafe in sweden . 
  but according to the media it 's a warzone . 
  a house in ireland would n't even be considered a `` real '' house in norway since it 's not fully detached . 
  the dream here is to live in a large detached house in the suburbs . 
  we 're basically americans in that aspect !, 
  so now ireland has the second highest gdp per capita in europe after luxembourg . 
  interesting ... 
   graduates are usually 21 if you start at 18 and only go for a bachelor degree . 
  however i know in norway it is common to have your conscription for one year and then start on your education . 
  some people work instead . 
  if you work in finance you probably have a master 's degree which makes a graduation age of 24-25 not really unrealistic . 
  now the numbers i can make up from the finance industry at the age 20-24 points to 34 300 nok ( 3215 gbp ) a month or 38 580 gbp a year . 
  so it is still higher . 
   they will be earning a large amount more than that by their late 20s . 
  yes of course . 
  the monthly wage has increased to 55100 nok ( 5165 gbp ) at 30 yrs old . 
  as to be expected !, 
   i ca n't find any data for norway but i would be suprised if graduates are flooding out of london ( as you suggest ) to work in norway 's financial industry due to much higher salaries . 
  according to statistics norway the average wage in the finance industry with workers aged 25-29 was [ 42 200 nok or 3950 gbp a month ] ( https://www.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/selectout/showtable.asp?fileformatid=2&amp;queryfile=20161211203724129714302lonnfinansny&amp;planguage=0&amp;maintable=lonnfinansny&amp;potsize=1 ) . 
  this equals 47 400 gbp a year . 
   operating on this system will always skew average salary statistics upward . 
  wages still rise pretty significantly with seniority . 
  the average wage for employees between 50-54 years old is 23 000 gbp more a year than for employees between 16-24 . 
  that 's nearly one average uk salary more a year with career progression . 
   maybe not quite as high as the u.s , but the u.s and the uk are considered the big two for highly specialized professionals . 
   there 's a reason skilled workers from around the world want to live in those two countries , there 's also a reason why those two countries receive more migrant applications than any other . 
  would like to see what kind of immigrants . 
  those illiterate people chilling out in calais is n't exactly the kind of people you want in your country . 
   un-regulated , free-market economies attract the most talented workers . 
  highly socialized economies attract the most average joe 's tell that to the thousands of foreign engineers and doctors that reside in norway . 
  the oil sector and healthcare sector is filled with them . 
  you also make it sound like the uk only attracts highly skilled people . 
  now is n't unskilled immigration one of the main reasons why you voted for brexit ? 
   but you specifically mentioned financial students go back to norway as the wages are higher , you were n't talking about the job market as a whole . 
  i highly doubt there is a single sector in the uk that has higher wages for graduates than norway . 
  even after several years . 
  the average wage in the uk is 505 gbp per week which is around 2100 gbp per month . 
  that is 230 gbp less than an 18 year old working full time in a supermarket would earn here in norway . 
  and in norway that would be a very shitty wage . 
   my point is that when people get further into their careers and become more specialzed , they have the opportunity to earn more money in more free-market economies like the uk and the us . 
  in the u.s i would agree . 
  but i 'm not sure the uk is at the same level . 
  anyways if you are very good at something you will earn a lot of money no matter what country you are in , atleast in the west . 
  we have our little financial `` elite '' of bankers and business owners too . 
  in fact there are more billionaires per capita in norway and sweden than in the u.s.

  `` leader josefine kitmitto for ansa london shows that norwegian students are increasingly seeing that in the norwegian labor market is an asset to have studied abroad . 
  she believes there are several reasons why students choose to return home when they start their careers . 
  - wages in norway is much higher than here in the uk and many students feel it is easier to start a career in norway , the `` safe '' because , says kitmitto . 
  - london is not a cheap city to live in , and the low wages combined with the high costs make it difficult to start a new life in london after finishing my studies , she emphasizes . '', 
   the more skilled/specialized you are in scandinavia , the less you 'll be earning in comparison to skilled/specialized workers in the uk/us . 
  to a certain degree . 
  norwegians studying finance in london end up going back home after their studies since the wages in the uk is much lower than back home . 
  that combined with the high cost of living in london makes it not worth it . 
  denmark barely have any payroll taxes which is why their gross wages are so high . 
  sweden on the other hand have very high payroll taxes . 
  those tax figures are way off . 
  most people is in the 25-27 % range . 
  [ belgium has quite high taxes compared to norway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_gdp ) . 
  that is despite our large tax revenues from the oil industry . 
  the euro is only the official currency in the eurozone countries . 
  however it is used by eurostat in comparisons . 
  it has a downside though as labour costs in euros can vary greatly in non-euro countries depending on currency fluctuations . 
  no need to be so upset by the way . 
  well a lot of europe do n't use the euro . 
  [ vi gj\u00f8r det allerede ] ( http://eeagrants.org/who-we-are/norway-grants ) , 
  i totally agree . 
  living abroad for some time really puts things in perspective . 
  norwegians have no idea how good they actually have it . 
  even compared to other western countries .
