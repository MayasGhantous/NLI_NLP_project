  reddit is like an archaeological site , where you find all sorts of precious artifacts of the mind . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i was curious about some notions in / r/philosophy , because they are heavily anglo saxon influenced . 
  even when they are mentioning language determinism ( but they do n't discuss ) , anglo-saxon influenced students are convinced they are part of an intellectual elite , that they have lost any ground traction . 
  i found this paper and became an idea about the reason . 
  german academic papers are a different challenge , by using an very specialized related language , which is extreme dense . 
  do n't care because all languages changes in just one generation and norwegian is no exemption . 
  what you are learning today is tomorrow the language of the past . 
  it 's different . 
  to me it 's looking very random . 
  gender word no de -------------------------------- book fem neuter hut fem neuter car masc neuter house neuter neuter women fem ( 1 ) fem color masc fem ( 1 ) exception bergen : masc while german is using articles , norwegian has post fixes examples : for the car : das auto ( from auto ) - bilen ( from bil ) book : das buch - boka ( bok ), 
  just because . 
  the problem with gender in languages is , it 's different from language to language . 
   native germans grew up in this culture . 
  whether or not they know every paragraph , they 're shaped by it ) really ? 
  because i understand german and i 'm curious i ' sometimes lurking around in german forums . 
  when it comes to religious freedom and freedom of speech there is n't much substance . 
  it 's easy : municipality -  traffic -  financing -  law gemeinde -  verkehr -  finanzierung -  gesetz, 
  i do n't agree . 
  this technology in combination with mechanics of the market contribute to a lesser gene pool , which is a real threat in the case of a new developing disease . 
  the press release is mentioning uncontrolled distribution which is a problem . 
  i have no primary concerns as you see , but a concern because of the agricultural industry . 
  submission statement : this press release is n't necessary my oppinion . 
  a discussion is welcome !, 
   europe is the homeland of europeans and european culture . 
  haha , what is this ? 
  christian culture , which that amount of atheists ? 
  is it prohibition of alcohol like in the 1920s in scandinavia ? 
  or is it the tradition of enlightenment ? 
   at the same time , the quran is actually seen as the word of god ask christians in the us about the bible and you get mostly the same answer . 
  as long as christianity will be taught in schools such policies would fast recognized as hypocrisy by the students . 
  this would make the islam more dangerous due to rebellious attitudes in this age . 
  religion does n't should be taught in school at all . 
  oh , a german agent is astroturfing, 
  the [ german article ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/vorab/malmstroem-soll-amerikanische-interessen-vertreten-haben-a-994087.html ) is mentioning an email from the us department of commerce with the content malmstr\u00f6m and the eu directorate-general home affairs `` have similar concerns as we do . '', 
  [ translation by google ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fspiegel%2fvorab%2fmalmstroem-soll-amerikanische-interessen-vertreten-haben-a-994087.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  the germans in their relentless work for more numbers did a good work and made a nice summary which country is net contributor and which country is net receiver of the eu . 
  clicking on the charts gives you a a pdf document with more numbers . 
  all numbers are related to 2012 . 
  first chart : the heros from sweden paid 0.46 of the gnp , while the uk paid only 0.39 of the gnp . 
  it 's called the thatcher bonus . 
  it 's just weird that belgium and netherlands are on the same level as the uk . 
  all of the baltic countries received more than 4 % of the gnp . 
  second chart . 
  while the swedish heros payed per capita 203 euros to brussels and the citizens of estonia received 589 euros per capita . 
  third chart : poland received as much money from the eu as germany paid , while the uk paid less than france . 
  i do n't know why swedish citizens are on the top , but kudos to them . 
  btw . 
  even the norwegians are paying , which is the price being associated . 
  the commissioner g\u00fcnther oettinger wants to prohibit internet provider change of eu citizens to protect investments . 
  some of you have already contracts that are lasting 24 months and oettinger is n't satisfied . 
  as a norwegian i fear this level of competence is infecting our politicians and we will be forced to do the same because of the treaty with the eu . 
  sometimes i 'm clicking links just to take a discovery tour to find something interesting or to find something which is touching the heart . 
  yesterday i followed the link to georgia / r/sakartvelo on the sidebar and found the the thread [ looking for georgian music ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sakartvelo/comments/2mg8ao/looking_for_georgian_music_any_genre/ ) . 
  such threads are always promising and beside an archive with georgian folk music i got the link to nice ad for georgia which is [ welcome to georgia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupfxqehomo ) . 
  looking for more at the sidebar at youtube i found [ this group ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lsf6kzlzwa ) which seems to be georgian as well . 
  and i found nina basharuli with [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu0eel1s7bo ) . 
  the sidebar gave me another direction to the song [ ederlezi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ederlezi_%28song%29 ) which is an old song of the romani . 
  i found many interpretations . 
  the first one is from a eastern european group beirut which lead me to a [ kurdish version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdvhaa-myeu ) , but the to most beautiful version is from [ elis dubaz and \u00c7a\u011fatay azat ( turkey ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=absj83v_is0 ) . 
  the last discovery was a spanish group performing another romani song [ djelem djelem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcuv9w0virc ) . 
  what 's your discovery ? 
  german unions were a long time dominated by a federation of unions which are section orientated called dgb ( deutscher gewerkschaftsbund ) and all of those unions are tight linked to the socialdemocrats since the 19th century . 
  a problem of the last 20 years of those unions was the inefficiency and kindness to demands of the government and employer , which resulted in loss of members . 
  but 4 years ago a court removed the law of only one union per company is allowed and many small unions are flourishing since then and they are more efficient and enthusiastic . 
  of course the employers do n't like such an development and the government as the janitor of the national economy has become allergic reactions . 
  a new proposal from minister andrea nahles is demanding only the union with the most members in a company should have the right to initiate a strike , which would render smaller unions for some years worthless and give the power back to the unions of the dgb at least for a short time . 
  the problem of the government is , the constitution guarantees the freedom of forming a coalition ( union for employees or union for employers ) , which makes this political fight interesting . 
  as a side note i have to mention andrea nahles was for 20 years ago on the left side of the socialdemocrats . 
  when this law will be active for at least 1 year the worker movement in germany should be dead . 
  the unions of the dgb are like zombies looking back at the time , when they were strong which was before 1914 . 
  only a minority take them serious , when the results are lower than the inflation . 
  [ the old critique on unions will be fullfilled . 
  after spain and germany the eu commissioner for digital economy and society g\u00fcnter oettinger is proposing a copyright tax on links . 
  translated : if google is using intellectual property of the eu , the eu should protect these values and require a levy from google for it . 
  it 's looking like the war from germany and spain against google has already begun . 
  [ the letter from the publishers to oettinger expresses concerns for the free flow of information . ] ( http://leistungsschutzrecht.info/download/file/fid/267 ) . 
  ** but this is not a war against google , it 's a war against all europeans !, 
  putting all pieces of information under the regime of copyright would be the ideal tool for censorship better than the chinese firewall , because everyone who is spreading information is threatened by bankruptcy . 
  the eu is becoming a monster . 
  ** ok , i know this has to be acknowledged by the parliament , but since a german lobbyist started the initiative to demand a breakup of google with success but without consequences , we should care about our future . 
  german companies demanding an end of the sanction , because it hurts many of them and us companies are making more profits because of the sanctions . 
  the trade volume of us companies grew from 5.264 to 5.931 billion dollar . 
  one of the problems is , the us sanction list is smaller than the european one and european companies have to follow both . 
  the eu seems to be field of conflicts , where germany is n't dictating but leading and countries like the uk want just a trade union and not the rest like the treaties about human rights . 
  southern europe is n't able to act because of the finances and east europe is split . 
  i 'm really curious how long the sanction will last , when already companies demanding an end . 
  i read [ here ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/23/glasgow-crash-tweet_n_6371428.html ) and [ here ] ( http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/crime/police-cars-in-street-of-sunderland-teen-arrested-over-offensive-glasgow-tragedy-tweet-1-7019833 ) you can get arrested about very bad jokes . 
  is that the freedom of speech in europe for the rest of europe too ? 
  when the government is starting to decide what is a bad or a allowed joke , everyone should be concerned , even when it comes from an asshole . 
  i found this article and i 'm thinking it 's a base for discussion . 
  i do n't share necessary the opinion of the author . 
  france is preparing new laws to control the internet . 
  websites provoking acts of terrorism and or offering child pornography to block them . 
  even commercial services get new responsibilities to prevent such a communication . 
  even when such statements about terrorism is done in `` privacy '' of the social net between friends it will be prosecuted . 
  conspiracy to support or plan a terror attack will be punished with up to 5 years in prison and become this stuff public 7 years are possible . 
  to make this possible , more spying on citizens is necessary . 
  welcome to europe in the 21th century . 
  people in austria , poland , germany and others were so intelligent to get loans in swiss francs .
