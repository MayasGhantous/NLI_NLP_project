  after yesterday the swiss franc is skyrocketing and many of them have to suffer for this decision . 
  until now , they have to pay a raise of ~ 30 % .

  the german pegida movement did n't include the federal state of schleswig-holstein at the border to denmark . 
  some parts of schleswig-holstein were danish until 1864 and i guess some danish nationalists and many redditors are open for this solution to work with the past of germany , just to have a laugh . 
  i love right wing movements for their contribution to entertainment . 
  leftists are mostly too serious . 
  this is a political problem :  i know that we infiltrate large-scale demonstrations with civil officers , who are acting as tactical provocateurs and masked stone throwers . 
  on command they throw stones or bottles towards the police , so that they are legally able to start the eviction . 
  i did n't become a police officer to clear protesters from roads or jerking off by trees . 
  [ in the newest publication of europol with the title `` exploring tomorrow 's organised crime '' ] ( http://www.statewatch.org/news/2015/mar/eu-europol-org-crime-report.pdf ) europol is basically going retard : cite :  the economic crisis has given rise to social movements questioning state authority questioning politicians was until now considered as a bold step towards a better future . 
  some may consider europol statement was mentioning terrorists but cite :  [ movements ] promoting open democracy including indignados and the occupy movement . 
  democracy must be something harmfully especially when people like those from swiss voting direct for laws and are able to make law proposals . 
  and europol is serious about cite :  state authorities and the private sector will rely on biometric information for a wide range of purposes including identification technologies , forming social networks based on genetic similarities which means nothing else , that citizens becoming suspects because of genetics . 
  this is n't in line with scientific knowledge , but who cares ? 
  europol is in need for money and is therefore producing the peace of shit . 
  of course you are a suspect when you have your mobile at home , because the police ca n't detect you . 
  but  criminals may think to leave their mobile phone at home , but the increased integration of connective abilities into a wide range of products will make it more difficult to leave no digital trace behind . 
  as seen [ in comments in this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ygyhs/american_users_of_this_subreddit_why_do_you_post/ ) the world is linked tight together i want to make a post in the context of ukraine . 
  [ zerohedge made a blog public ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-03-09/de-dollarization-encircles-globe-china-completes-swift-alternative-may-launch-soon-s ) which is a little bit concerned about the loss of control of trading transactions . 
  cite :  the final observation to make here is that if indeed it was the obama administration 's brilliant ploy to kick out russia - and by geopolitical affiliation , china - out of a monetary transaction mechanism that is controlled and supervised by the us and force the two biggest challengers to us global dominance into their own ( or joint ) payment system , then well , congratulations : it succeeded . 
  swift is n't a transaction system , but  china has accelerated the pace of yuan internationalization in recent years . 
  the central bank assigned 10 official yuan clearing banks last year , bringing the total number to 14 globally that can clear yuan transactions with china . 
  because of the sanctions against russia and the threat to cut off russia from swift , china made it 's own swift-and clearance system and will be able control transactions in yuan , which gives china an additional access to money and opportunities to introduce threats . 
  even when in this is relevant in the upcoming years for asia only , it has severe consequences in the future . 
  even emerging countries like south africa or south america are going to use this system as a alternative just in case . 
  putin tries to move the focus to asia and already now the economy russian far east is dominated by asia . 
  i have no doubts this will be a threat to the economy of europe . 
  it 's not just the gas , but food and machines too , which were delivered to russia . 
  at the same time asia gets a supplier more ( russia ) which is focusing towards east . 
  this raises the question what happens to ukraine ? 
  the eu that has n't the financial power in southern and eastern europe ca n't pay for ukraine like germany for the former gdr did , because i do n't think merkel want to pay . 
  or the eu is paying by printing money which they already do , when the ecb is buying bonds . 
  putin has annexed the krim because of geostrategic politics and neither eu nor the us is in the position to change this . 
  what can be done or want we to wait until the state of ukraine changes to a turmoil because the citizens are suffering already now ? 
  the newest example of bad propaganda is the newspaper ** welt am sonntag ** ( springer ) with a article about greece stating more than once greeks have 800 billion euro in the swiss . 
  the swiss itself stated it is 800million . 
  several german online magazines spread this number without checking the source . 
  a democracy need a public discussion but with such newspapers a democracy is doomed by media , [ source ] ( http://www.bildblog.de/63487/auf-7992-milliarden-mehr-oder-weniger-kommt-es-bei-griechenland-auch-nicht-mehr-an/ ) ) ps : i got for one week ago the information the polish media market is dominated by german media companies . 
  70 % of the regional press is owned by passauer neue presse verlag and the greatest boulevard newspaper is owned by springer . 
  europe needs better media . 
  cite  the bundeswehr is currently not in a position to fight modern russian battle tanks effectively . 
  [ . . ] the arrow ammunition based on tungsten does not produce enough kinetic energy to penetrate the armor of the latest technologically advanced russian combat vehicles of type t90 and t80 modernized . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article140083741/bundeswehr-kampfpanzern-fehlt-wirksame-munition.html ) it 's looking like the operation barbarossa was n't sufficient .

  [ the european university association made a comment on ttip ] ( http://www.eua.be/libraries/publication/eua_statement_ttip.sflb.ashx ) , because they are concerned such treaties are threaten the existence of public educuation . 
   the ability of elected national and regional authorities to determine the nature of their he ( higher education ) provision is cast into doubt by some of the key features of tisa and , by extension , of ttip . 
  the mechanisms of ` standstill ' , ` ratchet ' and ` future-proofing ' significantly limit the scope of legislative action once agreements have been signed . 
  they require that the level of service liberalisation can never be reduced ,, 
  on my travel through the web i encountered a news message about retired german woman who were singing old songs from their youth every sunday in a group . 
  after they announced the gathering in the local newspaper many times and the german gema found them . 
  the gema demanded a registration and fees . 
  because of the complicated structure only layers know how many fees must be paid , this event was ended forever . 
  legally this is correct . 
  all public singing even when just children are gathering must me registered at the gema . 
  the woman were about 80 years old . 
  after [ yesterday ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/13/counter-terrorism-bill-extremism-disruption-orders-david-cameron ) when cameron proposed new laws against extremism , i found something related . 
  it 's a comparison of the laws of the former gdr ( eastern germany ) with camerons proposals : `` harmful activities , e.g. 
  risk of public disorder or threat to the functioning of democracy '' vs. `` slander against the state '' \u00a7 220 criminal law gdr `` hate speech '' , `` purpose of overthrowing democracy '' vs. `` rabble-rousing against the state '' \u00a7 106 criminal law of the gdr `` a ban on broadcasting and a requirement to submit to the police in advance any proposed publication '' vs. `` treason '' \u00a7 \u00a7 245 , 246 this government will challenge those who seek to spread hatred '' vs. article 18 gdr constitution '' the ddr promotes and protects the socialist culture ... '' , which justified cencorship ok , it 's not a 100 % fit , but europeans have to be vigilant when politicians become more dangerous than common criminals . 
  the ability of producing shit propaganda is n't a monopoly of russia . 
  when the [ the telegraph is relating extensively ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11643847/clear-and-unequivocal-that-russia-faked-mh17-evidence-report-says.html ) to bellingcat no journalists made the job to check the claims . 
  we are lucky to have more than one comment on these pictures http://7mei.nl/2015/06/01/about-bellingcats-claim-russian-sat-pics-fake/ btw . 
  i do n't exclude the likelihood of russian rocket . 
  [ a journalist of the sunday times just said in this interview what he not did ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2015/06/14/tom-harper-nsa-files-snowden-howell-intv-nr.cnn/video/playlists/intl-latest-world-videos/ ) : investigating our journalists are n't better , by copying articles from british media to save money . 
  as a traveler for my company and of course as a norwegian i do n't have any cash in my pockets . 
  at home my bank card is the replacement for my wallet and when i 'm on a journey i do n't want more than 100eu in my pockets . 
  the credit card is for me the tool to pay in europe . 
  because of some weird demands of our customers i pay too often for a taxi more than 300eu . 
  and now i read a blog of a lawyer that berlin 's taxi companies are against paying with credit cards and were enforced to accept them . 
  but according to [ this article ] ( http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/ec--und-kreditkartenzahlung-in-berliner-taxis-berliner-taxifahrer-muessen-kreditkarten-annehmen,10809148,30644540.html ) a half part of the drivers wo n't accept neither ec cards nor credit cards in the future . 
  next time when i 'm in germany i will rent a car . 
  [ the al jazeera journalist ahmed mansour was arrested at a airport of berlin ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/20/germany-aljazeera-arrest-idinkbn0p00ns20150620 ) and got free after 2 days . 
  now the [ spiegel is revealing ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/fall-mansour-experten-werfen-behoerden-versagen-vor-a-1040799.html ) that there was n't an international arrest order from interpol . 
  it was just an arrest request from egypt that lead to the arrest of a journalist in germany . 
  everyone knows that the regime in cairo is arresting political opponents and the journalist is one of them . 
  the german sources can be translated with google translate , which is working from for german to english , but not the other way around . 
  a comment on facebook was  many people misunderstand the police task . 
  police task is not primarily to `` take '' people , or punish people . 
  police main task is to prevent . 
  it is better that the police alerts about increased control , rather than a run himself to death [ source ] ( http://www.nrk.no/nordland/politiet-varslet-rakjorerne-om-sine-egne-kontroller-1.12431214 ), 
  according to this [ article in the der standart ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000018240976/bnd-nsa-affaere-pilz-gigantische-ueberwachung-auch-in-polen ) / [ translation ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fderstandard.at%2f2000018240976%2fbnd-nsa-affaere-pilz-gigantische-ueberwachung-auch-in-polen&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) the bnd as well as the nsa is spying on poland by direct accessing cables . 
  if someone is ringing to europe the bnd was always in the cable . 
  from a point of view of geopolitics this is interesting . 
  it 's like everyone is fucking everyone in the eu . 
  german finance minister sch\u00e4uble wanted to transfer greek property to a organization under his control . 
  the institution for growth ( ifg ) should have got the responsibilities for the properties and the ifg is a daughter of the [ kfw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kfw ) which is direct under sch\u00e4ubles control or at least under the control of the german government . 
  [ source is a mp of the german bundestag ] ( https://www.facebook.com/mdb.klaus.ernst/posts/10153366056126023 ), 
  federalism is poison for basic services like education . 
  federal states are playing against the government and vice versa . 
  an example is germany when the 16 states have different education standards even though they have a commission to solve such a problem . 
  i prefer one standard and one responsibility . 
  while this historians is quite naive and stupid , his statement is based on the perception on chinese history . 
  chinese interpret the times when china was split into kingdoms as the most destructive ones . 
  and so is the present policy to avoid any obstruction of this unity .
