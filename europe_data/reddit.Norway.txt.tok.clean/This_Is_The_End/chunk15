  you do n't know how old they are . 
  some questions may come from teenagers doing homework . 
  norway : my company pays my mobile to save money . 
  i have unlimited talk minutes and texting . 
  my free data is 2gb , which is fucking low for lte . 
  in the case i 'm traveling for my employer outside europe he is paying the roaming too . 
  tethering is no problem . 
  dating here in norway has the spectrum from going into a restaurant to jumping into the bed after a party at the first night . 
  since 50 % of marriages are abandoned over time , it may be a good idea not to get married . 
  getting divorced can be an expensive process . 
  and why should the government have to register your love with a partner ? 
  either you are able to support the partnership the whole life or you are n't . 
  a marriage does n't change anything at all . 
  that 's said , living together without being married is common here in scandinavia . 
  none , because i see movies because of it 's story . 
  the only us productions i remember which is worth the fuzz is ** maria full of grace ** with catalina sandino moreno and ** a prairie home companion ** with several known vips . 
  it 's a great film about this swedish observer who is slowly transformed into the person he observes . 
   i 'm not swedish but persona is my favourite film of all time . 
  i know bergman is n't everyone cup of tea , but still ... bergman is the king . 
  he made basically theater on the screen . 
  some swedish directors like jan troell with `` emigrants '' , `` il capitano '' and `` everlasting moments '' are awesome as well . 
  norway : ** kitchen stories **  a scientific observer 's job of observing an old cantankerous single man 's kitchen habits is complicated by his growing friendship with him . 
  this film is about 2 persons and it has no heroes . 
  rolig ( norwegian , calm , quit ) < -  roligt ( swedish , fun ) rente ( german , pension ) < -  rente ( norwegian , interest ), 
  there is this huge catalog of the european human rights convention , which would be a no go for the us, 
  it 's a boring town in the us in the middle of nowhere . 
  i would prefer seattle or new york for a visit . 
  norwegian here : 1 ) we have a good deal with the eu and we are pragmatic . 
  so fuck the eu , but hurray europe !, 
  2 ) the eu is undemocratic and is fucking over small countries . 
  greece was a good example , when a population was punished for the fuckup of corrupt greek politicians and eu politicians , without any greater involvement of the eu parliament . 
  greece was set under pressure by technocrats . 
  it 's looking like the good old times of the ussr . 
  3 ) another example for a bad eu is the demand from the eu to lower the guarantee of norwegians banks for customers money , because it was unfair . 
  if there is a real crisis it does n't matter , but it shows who gets the priorities in the eu . 
  it 's not the citizen . 
  4 ) we are managing our fishing resources well enough , while the eu is known for it 's unsustainable policies . 
  and we do n't have to share the fishing resources . 
  i remember the discussion with a welsh fisher , who was very upset about the spanish boats at his door and the spanish are n't known for doing sustainable fishery . 
  5 ) anyway because of our good deal we are implementing all orders from the commission and we are almost always the fastest . 
  that is the schizophrenic aspect of the mess . 
  the eu is developing and we may be enforced to beg for membership , when the eu should not longer consider our geopolitical value as valuable . 
  the alternative would be an exclusion from our main market . 
  i do n't have any connection to ours history but for an academic curiosity . 
  because the people from the past are dead . 
  derrick from germany is an eternal hit here . 
  british shows are popular as well dr. who top gear bonder\u00f8ven from denmark beside that , we get some documentaries from the uk , denmark , germany and sweden, 
  [ the news that democrats and republicans are supporting artificial high drug prices ] ( http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/taibbi-on-republicans-and-democrats-blocking-drug-reimportation-w485638 ) is giving me enough information for stating that americans are fucked by right wing extremists . 
  she is literally erdogan, 
  this will never happen , because languages developing fast from each other . 
  the french effort to conserve the national language is a fight against windmills . 
  they tried something similar in norway too . 
  now there is just a committee left to record the changes of the languages . 
  news from foreign countries are copied from british media, 
  what do you want with greenland ? 
  it 's just a black hole for money, 
  - it 's expensive , which is only partially true . 
  electronics , kitchen appliances and food are n't expensive . 
  alcohol , houses and apartments are expensive . 
  - it 's cold : it 's sometimes worse because most of norway 's population is living in a coastal regions with a humid climate between 0c-20c . 
  the awesome regions with a continental climate are much better with low amount of rain , low humidity and temperatures between -30 c to 25c - it 's dark : it 's dark for 2 months in northern norway , while the rest of the year is much better than in the south, 
  the eu and norway have now a regulation in place to avoid that . 
  it 's just for 2 months . 
  the rest of the year is much better . 
  i would n't exchange the grey weather in central europe with snow and an awesome eastern time . 
  drink a beer on the balcony ? 
  no , we are already in the joy for expecting the next spring with long days . 
  norway : storbritannia which translates to great britain, 
  it 's mostly boring pop music , created in an office by a music designer [ like this guy here ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_der_produktionen_von_dieter_bohlen#ann_turner ) for 3rd class artists . 
  it 's not about americans , it 's about a culture fostering stupidity by under financing public schools , not recognizing other cultures and a ridiculous media landscape . 
  trump is n't the bad boy . 
  the damage was long done before . 
  this political system accepts even politicians who are stating that no healthcare is n't killing anyone . 
  many american people does n't even grasp the concept of a modern society , when they talk about universal healthcare as a handout . 
  they are n't getting the point that a modern society is bound together by fulfilling different tasks . 
  the government is a sort of elected dictatorship , while in europe a government is the administration to organize the life together , which makes it possible to commute to the job or simply retiring from work . 
  too many american have n't any idea about modern states , because of a lack of education . 
  yesterday i found this [ gem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhqks1vry5q&amp;list=pljvz8ukcdgulebvodi8pp-z9txb0tdr0s ) . it explains a lot of why so many americans are hostile against thinking beyond the known horizon . 
  and even academics are narrow minded . 
  i had a discussion with the mods of / r/philosophy and my idea of allowing other languages than english was denied even when all sides agreed it is an exclusion of none anglophone philosophy . 
  the concept of / r/europe having many mods and embracing multiple cultures was thrown away because of they want to have control . 
  i judge americans when i meet them according to their statements . 
  but american culture is in my opinion narrow minded . 
  brand from henrik ibsen, 
  almost all nobles were killed in the civil war in the 12th century . 
  i 'm grateful king [ sverre sigurdsson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sverre_of_norway ) did this . 
  turkey is n't any threat , because what is happening now if for the sake of domestic politics . 
  no they are n't bad , just a little bit tooo eager to save money . 
  many of them working more than 10hours a day , getting problems with their body at the age of 40 . 
  norwegian reporting in : as much as i dislike the eu the reality is , we are depending on the eu economically . 
  we have no real choice . 
  norway : norway 's environmental politics is sometimes strange . 
  we have not many deniers , but - hydro power is n't defined as environmental friendly . 
  - governments lost a lot of tax money by paying for research into co2 retention . 
  the energy loss is something about 20 % - we are selling a lot of fossil energy ( oil , gas ) - we have good incentives to buy electric cars , but public transport in the rural regions is n't good , which is a waste of resources - climate change has already arrived . 
  tree are growing again at heights over 800m and some blood sucking bugs are back . 
  - personally i 'm very environmental friendly by walking to and from the job . 
  but this is a luxury not everyone has . 
  most urban areas an planned for the car and this is going to change . 
  i have no pride , but it 's quite interesting .
