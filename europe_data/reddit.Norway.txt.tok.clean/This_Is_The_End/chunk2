  it 's about the markets and nothing else . 
  btw . 
  sweden and norway have sold a lot of services of the state . 
  the problem of eastern europe is different . 
  the globalized markets are already saturated . 
  compete in a saturated marked demands money . 
  what do you call a protest is a request to criminals to behave better . 
  sounds really rational . 
  the point is , they searched for a salvation by fidesz and harvested right wing liberalism . 
  i 'm a little bit sarcastic because similar happened in all eastern european countries . 
  the hole history of hungary is well documented by for example telepolis . 
  my prediction for the future of eastern europe is not good one . 
  eastern europe was the workbench or the eu to achieve lower wages and it worked well . 
  since asia is cheaper the eu has huge problems . 
  and large parts of the production capacity of eastern europe is n't needed anymore . 
  since the voters are denying to think about rational solutions , they want simply a government with a strong hand running former politics with more success . 
  the result will be a lot of orbans in the future . 
  i have no compassion for such a stupidity . 
  i know fidesz changed the rules to make the opposition suffering . 
  but the rules are democratic and similar to other european countries . 
   i wonder if the alternative would have been any better ? 
  that 's not my concern , because so is democracy, 
  no , just you are doing this , because you do n't read, 
  this is the mathematics of elections . 
  this type of rigging is usual . 
  in germany it 's the `` 5 % klausel '' , in norway it 's called the `` 3 % sperregrense '' and in the uk the winner takes it all , which guarantees majorities with 40 % of the votes . 
  where have you been , when hungarians voted for this government ? 
  do you want to tell hungarians how they have to vote ? 
  remembering british and american elections this is n't really bad . 
  some british pm got elected with less than 30 % of all votes . 
  when orban would be seen as the evil guy there would be a sort of revolution in hungary like after 1956 . 
  victor orban is n't an idiot . 
  he is knowing what he is doing and no one wanted to slow him down . 
  his way to power is well documented on european media . 
  orban and his followers are right wing politicians believing in a strong , hierarchical and nationalistic country . 
  everyone who is n't following the line , is an enemy of the nation . 
  electing such politicians has the precondition the voters are ideologically compatible . 
  those who are now a minority are silent . 
  1 beer for 0.5 euro ? 
  happy poland !, 
  thank you and condolences because you are fucked ( not just literally ) . 
  hungarians voted for their own hangman victor orban and harvesting now taxes on network traffic and the government is controlling the last resort of the media by raising the costs for internet usage . 
  in this case of pm victor orban who is ruling like a king with a two-thirds majority in the parliament it 's obvious who is guilty . 
  stupid people voting for stupid politicians . 
  should we show compassion ? 
  no , it 's more an action against the evil internet . 
  it 's better than the chinese system . 
  because people censoring themselves because they ca n't afford the political debate in the internet . 
  hungarians voted for their own hangman victor orban and harvesting now taxes on network traffic . 
  in this case of pm victor orban who is ruling like a king with a two-thirds majority in the parliament it 's obvious who is guilty . 
  stupid people voting for stupid politicians . 
  should we show compassion ? 
  try to write something like `` i love gays '' on your car in alabama like the topgear did . 
  it will be the same result . 
  nationalism is a bad drug , especially in europe . 
  woman are allowed the same stupid things men do . 
  what a huge step forward into our bright future !, 
   heavy catholic influence in polish politics is quite a new thing , mostly of communist-regime doing . 
  the influence of the catholic church was always strong in poland . 
  i saw german documentaries before 1998 and was surprised . 
  even solidarnosk has a strong link to the church . 
  you know that the parliament has n't the right to propose law 's ? 
  it 's like in the 19th century . 
  i 'm not a fan of such `` democracy '' and it does n't help to transform europe into a fellowship of cultures, 
  in my opinion the eu is a dictatorship and countries like norway does n't have an influence anyway . 
  the ukip is promissing better times without the eu , without saying how the dependence on the eu is working after a separation . 
  i like europe , but i do n't like the eu . 
  we are in need of something different like regions solely controlled by it 's citizens and not by politicians . 
  i searched for prints , but all prints are very limited in size . 
  edelfelt 's portraits are awesome . 
  [ beef from whale in a pepper sauce with mushrooms ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6sn2jmj5img/t8sgfmtvczi/aaaaaaaagug/35jlivbo2_i/s640/hvalkj%c3%b8tt+med+peppersaus+2.jpg ), 
  you will be surprised how the eu is hurting the uk when the uk is not longer a member of the eu . 
  the threat of export penalties makes norway obey every word of the eu commission . 
  lets get some facts : 1 . 
  the amount of subsidies payed to edf is something about 17billion euro 2 . 
  edf is getting additional a guaranteed price per mwh of 92.5 pound , which is twice the price of the free market . 
  this guaranteed price will be compensated for inflation . 
  because of the subsidies austria sues the commission . 
  no even renewable energy in germany get that much subsidies . 
  it 's just nice to know how long areva is already building the finnish reactor which costs already more than twice as planned . 
  the finnish government was so smart to pay a fixed price . 
  i have n't that amount of sarcasm for the astroturfers here . 
  when portugal was down rated in 2009 [ spain had a at least 30 % higher unemployement rate ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/3-01032010-ap/de/3-01032010-ap-de.pdf ) and spain was already in a ressesion while portugal was n't . 
  even the [ deficit spending of uk ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mjmwqtpmusk/svab06zv6gi/aaaaaaaaeo8/bu172wts0vm/s640/fiscal-deficits---oecd.gif ) was higher . 
  so the question is what was the reason to run portugal into bankruptcy , because the following down ratings were made with the reason of more expensive loans , which are the consequence of a down rating ? 
  the situation in southern europe is n't unknown for years . 
  the only reason for a new crisis could be a political one , when washington gives hints to rating agencies . 
  the eu is fucked since the ratings went down followed by a politic of austerity . 
  before this process started portugal had pretty god numbers , at least better ones than italy and spain but got bad rating together with greece which triggered expensive loans . 
  my thoughts are this crisis is based on a vulnerable economy and political actions . 
  the latter is interesting because too many countries are interested into killing south european economies to gain an advantage . 
  my candidates of criminals are the us , germany and the uk .

  when the oil was discovered and norway a fucking poor country it offered the swedish a part of statoil to finance the exploitation of oil wells . 
  the swedish government was so friendly to say no . 
  since then norway now is pretty alone with the piles of cash , lucky and is looking to it 's swedish neighbor with a huge smile .
