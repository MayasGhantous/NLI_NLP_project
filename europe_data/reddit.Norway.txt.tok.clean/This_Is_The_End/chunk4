  just to be fair : on both sides the nationalists were active . 
  the danish wished to annex schleswig for good , which was already under the realm of the danish king , but a part of the former heiliges reich deutscher nationen . 
  most of people spoke german and wished to be a independent part of denmark , caused by a ( stupid ? ), 
  danish nationalism demanding being danish for making a career . 
  on the other side , bismark got the idea to expand the influence of prussia and formed an alliance with austria . 
  some german speaking intellectuals like theodor storm were unhappy with the result , because prussia was just another power removing the special culture in schleswig . 
  because of ww1 there was in ~ ~ 1923 ~ ~ 1920 a plebiscite about which parts of schleswig should be german or danish and the result was even accepted by hitler . 
  after ww2 is treaty between western germany and denmark was made which guaranteed a special treatment for minorities . 
  even from berlin or frankfurt it 's not really far away . 
  the real problem is a hotel room . 
  the museum of schloss gottorp in schleswig . 
  this museum is about them times from stoneage to the middelages incl . 
  a collection of viking items and boats . 
  the freilicht museum of kiel-molfsee with a huge collection of houses from the past incl . 
  the interior . 
  the r\u00f6misches-germanisches museum in k\u00f6ln . 
  k\u00f6ln is build on a ancient roman city and many items are in the museum . 
  kiel when the sail boat meeting `` kieler woche '' is ongoing . 
  the medieval city of l\u00fcneburg 6 . 
  a tour with a bicycle in the south of hamburg into the woods of harburg along the river elbe is something different !, 
  the medieval city of l\u00fcbeck 8 . 
  a tour along the kiel canal with a bicycle, 
  norwegian , german , english . 
  i 'm able to understand : low german , danish , swedish, 
  if the eu would be about human rights , the eu should n't be silent and accuse orban since a long time ago . 
  human right are in place to protect us before a government . 
  if you are removing the protection for terrorists , you are removing your protection too . 
  think of the usa where every citizen can be declared as a terrorist or gets on the no fly list , without legal protection . 
  the point here is , al qaeda is against human rights and we should defend human rights , even for idiots bombing others . 
  yesterday it was kiev and tomorrow ? 
  sometime we should remind polish right wing extremists at the [ polish-soviet war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) in 1919 , when the new founded polish nation under j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski tried to get their peace of russia when the russian civil war was raging at the same time . 
  the characteristics of nationalism does n't change on all sides incl . 
  the hypocrisy . 
  europe has no need for such jerks . 
  economic prosperity does n't come from war . 
  removing a nasty dictator and introducing is is fun ? 
  it does n't help . 
  each us company offering data services is under suspicion leaking data to the government . 
  as long you want to make business in the us , the us has jurisdiction . 
  that is a real problem for bnp paribas . 
  they do n't want to pay the penalty , but the consequence would be no clearance in new york . 
  fox news is a unbiased source !, 
  it was part of the 2 +4 treaty, 
  i hate this amount of bad propaganda . 
  all sorts of russians supporting the eastern ukraine which is nothing new and the government in kiew is talking about terrorists to justify the casualties of civilians by shelling into the towns . 
  the nato promissed ~ ~ russia ~ ~ ussr for many years ago not to deploy forces east of germany and russia took the krim . 
  meanwhile the polish and baltic governments are circlejerking by demanding money from the eu because of sanctions their have demanded . 
  this is a civil war with all the terrible aspects included and no one is innocent . 
  accept it and stop being a jerk here . 
  well sanctions are working !, 
  the real challenge is , all members of the eu have to agree . 
  because some members like spain have already problems with the independence of catalunya . 
  i have my doubts that is going to happen . 
  it 's legal because it 's the land of the free . 
  do whatever you want !, 
  it 's just stupid that saudi arabia is one of the best allies of the nato . 
  as long as the nato is trying to gain influence with the help of such allies , nothing will change . 
  being huge is n't an advantage for the democratic participation of it 's citizens . 
  it 's already the case that media moguls are controlling the published public opinion . 
  why should russia risk a war against a power block that has more than 10times the industrial and military power ? 
  a nuclear war would be terminal for all of us . 
  there is no real option for a war . 
  i hope you are able to point on a globe om austria . 
  this is just an reminder that too many americans are so stupid and pointing to europe when they were ask for new zealand . 
  this thread is circle jerking,

  [ helgeland ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/berg_i_helgeland.jpg ) is a mix of hundreds of isles and fjords between br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund and bod\u00f8 2 . 
  [ r\u00f8ros ] ( http://thornews.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/rc3b8ros-kirke-og-hus.jpg ) is a former mining city and most of it 's houses in the core are very old . 
  parts of the old mine are open .

  anyway unions in europe are more or less dead . 
  even when some of them have a lot of members most of the unions are fighting for jobs which make them wake , because they have to make arguments for the success of a company . 
  without the sucess of a company their members are losing the wages . 
  the bosses know that and blackmailing unions all the time . 
  so members are experiencing unions which making agreements that are bad for union members like more work time or lesser wages . 
  [ a better explanation ] ( http://www.ruthlesscriticism.com/unions.htm ), 
  which renders / r/nottheonion irrelevant because more pay walls are arriving . 
   we also have some small , local restaurants that serve food that is better than all of those places and costs about the same . 
  these places will be either mexican ( serving tacos and tortas for a low price ) or vietnamese ( serving sandwiches for a low price and pho or other noodle or rice dishes for a slightly higher price ) . 
  reddit becomes useful !, 
  sorry , you are overqualified . 
   to be honest american or at least my school did n't really teach languages that well you just read a sentence in spanish and translate it on paper unlike i think europe where you probably would have to learn german or english or french to communicate extensively . 
  my experience from europe is different . 
  read stories , learn grammar and translate . 
  this may have changed on some places , but not with german here in norway . 
  it 's easiest to learn a language for me by listen to radio and tv and try to talk with native speakers . 
  in the us you should have good access to spanish radio and tv ? 
  tbh learning a language is for most people hard work , when they ca n't speak and hear the language at least once a week . 
   the european queen mom , merkel , speaks fluent russian :p . . take that and putin is speaking german well . 
  you have your next conspiracy theory !, 
  therefore you have to read reddit/r/europe and other subs . 
  life is always better than any comedian ! . 
  german intelligence tried always to justify it 's existence by exaggerating problems and was involved into scandals like wiretapping the telephone of journalists . 
  i would n't trust them 1mm, 
  from a geopolitical perspective spain ca n't afford to lose catalonia . 
  it 's one of the economically most potent regions .
