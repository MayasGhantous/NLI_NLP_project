  just like the so-called populists they sneer at , they first and foremost care about themselves and their own positions . 
  turns out that they 're not incompetent . 
  they just need to be in imminent danger of losing their jobs before they fix long standing problems . 
  i still hope some of them get a right kick in the ass come next election . 
  lmftfy : how inflated state spending is fueling sweden 's economic boom . 
  quick 3-step way to stop this : 1 . 
  stop giving cash handouts 2 . 
  do n't `` tolerate '' those who are denied asylum but still stick around getting fed by the state 3 . 
  send economic migrants back . 
  no shit . 
  look at the coming population explosion in africa . 
  nigera alone will reach 400 million by 2050 . 
  an increasingly large part of the world population will be living in impoverished sub-sahara countries with unstable governments , little economic growth and poor social structures . 
  combine that with the coming global warming and you have the perfect migration storm . 
  the next decades is going to make the 2015 migration wave look like a light breeze . 
  they do n't even have to enter italian water in order to be dropped off on an italian island when they 're rescued . 
  its absolutely nuts !, 
   you 're comparing british leeches with hard working european citizens well , if you put it like that / s seriously , there is no doubt that both parties , the uk and the eu , will experience some negative developments if eu citizens are forced to leave the uk and uk citizens are forced to move back . 
  i think it 's less clear cut as to who will lose the most . 
  in what way ? 
  we do n't really have that many retirees from the eu settling here in norway due to the cost of living . 
  the largest norwegian retiree `` colonizes '' can be found in asia , such as thailand , and to a smaller degree spain . 
  most norwegian retirees in spain make use of private healthcare centers due to perceived quality or language barriers , there are even private hospitals in several spanish cities with norwegian/scandinavian speaking staff . 
  i 'm quite confident that the average norwegian living abroad put more into foreign state budget than they take out of them . 
  our eea agreement might be up for re-negotiation if on the the most pivotal opposition party ( senterparitet ) get their will , but baring a renegotiation i do n't this its likely that were forced to accept the cost of our citizens in other eu countries . 
  i guess the uk should demand that other eu countries pay for whatever social support their citizens receive in the uk after brexit . 
  unemployment , social support , etc. 
  this negotiation process is going to get fun , at least for us norwegians that get to watch this shit show from the sidelines . 
  labour should indeed start to worry . 
  not that corbyn cares about wining elections . 
   reports of ms james 's resignation sparked speculation that mr farage - ukip leader from 2006-2009 and 2010-2016 - might return to lead the party for a third time . 
  but he told the press association : `` i 'm not coming back , i 'm retired '' . 
  perhaps there is now finally room for [ figel narage ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cmhuvxgwaaamc59.jpg ), 
  some political opponents have likened our [ minster ] ( http://e24.vgc.no/drpublish/images/article/2013/11/25/22645383/1/990/2005091.jpg ) of finance to a dragon , but she seems to be more occupied with using the oil money than saving it . 
  granted , they 've been off in several areas . 
  that being said , it 's still just 2016 , almost 2017 . 
  the decade forecast is valid for , you guessed it , a decade . 
  it 's also unfair/unrealistic to expect every forecast to be correct . 
  stratfor 's forecasts have thus far been way better than anything i could 've come up with in 2010 . 
  sweden , why so angry ? 
  you could always pump it back into the ground ? 
  romania , you seem to be doing well ; care to pay more for our oil ? 
  we 're struggling and the opposition is losing its mind now that the unemployment is a whopping 5 %, 
  had it not been for the editorializing rule , i would have changed it into something more descriptive of the actual content . 
  stratfor 's analysis tend to be pretty good , but i should probably mention to those not familiar with the think tank that they 've been very negative towards the future of the eu for the last 10-15 years . 
  they 've consistently and over a long period of time foretasted the eu 's eventual collapse/decline into obscurity , they 've yet to get it right , but i agree with much of their underlying analysis of why the eu is likely to decline in the coming years . 
  ** the fragile periphery ** by comparison , countries in the eurozone 's periphery tend to support deeper european integration , though they are also among the most vulnerable economies in the bloc . 
  these states , which include greece , portugal and spain , rely on eu subsidies and development funds to stay afloat . 
  they will continue to back the concept of continental integration as long as it means financial aid for their foundering economies . 
  the region has had its own complaints about the european union , but most did not appear until the continent 's financial crisis -- and the austerity measures that followed -- began . 
  even then , instead of the right-wing nationalism that emerged elsewhere in the bloc , these countries largely supported left-wing parties that wanted to increase spending and restructure debt rather than close borders or restrict immigration . 
  ( right-wing nationalism rose somewhat in greece , but it did not rise nearly as dramatically as it did in northern europe . ), 
  the states along the eurozone 's southern edge may leave the currency zone at some point . 
  but if they do , it is more likely to be in response to an unexpected crisis than a planned decision . 
  though these countries have similar visions of what they think the european union looks like in the future , their political and economic weakness will make it difficult for them to form an effective alliance and to take charge of the bloc 's decision-making process . 
  and as weak growth , feeble banking sectors , large debts and high unemployment continue to take an economic toll , these countries ' traditionally pro-europe populations could slowly start to turn on thethe coalition builders the closer euroskepticism creeps to the continent 's economic and political core , the more dangerous it will become for the bloc . 
  northern european countries such as austria , finland and the netherlands are some of the eurozone 's richest and most fiscally disciplined members . 
  these states are largely preoccupied with protecting their national wealth from southern europe , and they have strong euroskeptic parties that seek to defend their sovereignty against the interference of eu institutions . 
  that said , they also have an incentive , given their economies ' reliance on exports , to protect their markets abroad -- most of which belong to the european union . 
  northern european countries tend to coordinate their moves with their neighbors and with larger powers . 
  they are far more likely to collectively push for continental reform or for the creation of regional blocs than they are to risk their own isolation by acting unilaterally . 
  though states like denmark and sweden are not part of the eurozone , they are culturally and ideologically similar to their counterparts in northern europe and could someday join them in a regional replacement for the european union . 
  talk of forming a `` northern eurozone '' or `` northern schengen '' has become common in this part of europe . 
  lithuania , latvia and estonia are in some ways an exception , though . 
  they joined the european union and eurozone to discourage russian aggression by linking themselves as closely to the west as possible . 
  as the home of the european union 's most important institutions , belgium is also set apart from its northern european neighbors , and regional politics often take precedence over national efforts to chip away at the bloc 's influence . 
  each of these countries is unlikely to leave the european union or eurozone of its own volition , though they could become part of a northern alliance should the bloc dissolve . 
  ** the big three ** if the nation-state will be the primary agent of the european union 's coming transformation , it stands to reason that the bloc 's largest members -- germany , france and italy -- will be at the forefront of it . 
  italy has historically seen european integration as a means to tie itself to its prosperous northern neighbors and to preserve the unity of the country . 
  but over the past decade , italians have become some of the continent 's most euroskeptic citizens , thanks to their country 's skyrocketing debt and political instability . 
  italy is therefore one of the countries that is most likely to use the threat of its exit to squeeze concessions from brussels . 
  rome has already leaned on the `` too big to fail '' argument in its negotiations with the european union , and future italian administrations are likely to do the same . 
  but as europe continues to fragment , each threat will become more dangerous to the bloc than the last . 
  france and germany , meanwhile , hold the key to the european union 's future . 
  even the suggestion of a french or german exit from the bloc or its currency zone would risk triggering a massive structural overhaul . 
  by the same token , the two countries ' continued buy-in could be enough to keep the european union -- or some version of it -- together . 
  but france and germany face a paradoxical problem : for strategic reasons they need to maintain a united front , but their national interests continue to pull them apart . 
  france , as both a mediterranean and northern european nation , has found itself torn between a desire to protect its economy and the need to preserve its alliance with germany . 
  paris tends to support protectionist and risk-sharing measures , and it has a high tolerance for inflation . 
  berlin , however , prefers to avoid policies that threaten its wealth and share the risk created by southern europe 's weak economies . 
  germany would only agree to france 's approach if berlin were given more control over the fiscal policies of its neighbors -- something many countries would find unacceptable . 
  of the two , france is more likely to act first in demanding the european union 's reorganization because of its rising nationalism and sluggish economic growth . 
  but germany , hamstrung by its own national interests , would find it tough to compromise with its longtime partner . 
  at this point , reaching a consensus on a path forward has become all but impossible for the european union 's members . 
  to knit themselves even closer together , eu states would have to compromise on issues that are too important to budge on . 
  the alternative option -- reversing european integration -- is gaining ground , but it comes with the very real possibility of leading to the bloc 's complete dismantling . 
  members could take a middle road of sorts by choosing to keep things as they are , but even inaction would come at a price , promising even greater problems for the troubled bloc down the line . 
  the european union 's future has been up for debate since the continent 's economic crisis began nearly a decade ago . 
  but questions about the bloc 's path have multiplied in recent years as greece came close to quitting the eurozone and the united kingdom voted to relinquish its eu membership for good . 
  `` the bloc 's demise is not a matter of if , but when , '' euroskeptics insisted , to which their europhile peers replied , `` the union is irreversible . '', 
  yet like all political creations , the european union is a momentary construction in the vast expanse of history . 
  one day it will disappear , to be replaced by other entities , or it will continue in name only , looking and operating far differently from the european union of today . 
  it is impossible to know exactly when this transformation will happen or just how long the process will take . 
  there are some clues , however , as to how the new europe will come about and , perhaps even more important , what the agent of change will be . 
  if anything , the continent 's current crisis is a stark reminder that despite decades of attempts to weaken it , the nation-state remains the most powerful political unit in the european union . 
  and as it emerges from the rubble of the continent 's latest experiment in integration , it will play a crucial role in charting europe 's course forward . 
  ** a union that 's anything but uniform ** not all eu members are created equal . 
  losing a member that belongs to the eurozone , for example , poses a much bigger threat to the rest of the system than the departure of one that does not . 
  the prospect of greece quitting the currency area in 2015 was probably more frightening to france and germany than britain 's decision to leave the bloc a year later . 
  to be sure , both events would have serious consequences for the european union , but a grexit would have immediately shaken the financial foundation of the entire eurozone .
