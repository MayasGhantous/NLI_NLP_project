  the consequences of the brexit , however , will be more gradual . 
  support for eu institutions likewise varies from country to country . 
  according to the pew research center , 72 percent of poles see the european union positively -- a view only 38 percent of frenchmen share . 
  meanwhile , the latest eurobarometer poll has put support for the eurozone at a whopping 82 percent in luxembourg , compared with a mere 54 percent in italy . 
  the euroskepticism sweeping the continent has assumed different forms wherever it has taken root : france 's national front advocates leaving the european union , while italy 's five star movement calls for abandoning only the eurozone . 
  at the same time , moderate political parties are increasingly seeking to end the free movement of workers and to reintroduce border controls , even as they hold onto their eu membership . 
  amid these varying demands and faced with the prospect of a grexit and brexit , the european union is being forced to consider the process for leaving the union and whether countries should be allowed to remain members of some parts of the bloc and not others . 
  during discussions on the greek bailout last year , some countries argued that leaving the eurozone also meant leaving the european union . 
  others proposed ways to suspend athens ' membership in the currency area while preserving its place in the continental bloc . 
  a year later , the same debates are being had about britain . 
  several eu members have said that access to europe 's internal market comes at price -- namely , accepting eu workers -- while others have proved more open to finding a compromise . 
  regardless of how the talks between london and brussels shake out over the next few years , they will eventually result in a roadmap for leaving the bloc that other members could use to guide their own departures . 
  of course , this raises another question : why would countries want to leave the european union or its structures in the first place ? 
  again , the answer depends on the member . 
  some governments , whether backed by a popular referendum or parliamentary approval , might voluntarily choose to leave . 
  studies like the latest eurobarometer , which showed that the continent 's trust in the european union dropped sharply from 57 percent in 2007 to 33 percent in 2016 , suggest that the british referendum may not be the last of its kind . 
  on the other hand , some governments might be forced out of the bloc , should they become politically or financially unable to accept the conditions attached to retaining their membership . 
  ( athens , for instance , made a conscious decision to consent to creditors ' demands in order to stay in the eurozone . ), 
  still others could depart as the entities they belong to dissolve , either as the result of a consensual decision or because of an existential crisis . 
  ** likelihood and consequence ** which countries choose to renounce their membership in the european union or its institutions will determine the bloc 's fate . 
  the organization could probably weather croatia 's departure , but it would not survive france 's . 
  there is also something to be said for the strength in numbers : the flight of a single , small economy would not endanger the european union , but a coordinated exit of several assuredly would . 
  certain political and geographic factors will affect members ' chances of someday withdrawing from the continental bloc . 
  a large euroskeptic population could pressure its government to opt out of the european union , or encourage politicians to do so in pursuit of higher approval ratings . 
  countries with strong economies or strategic locations on the continent could use their advantages to wrangle a better exit deal -- or to exact concessions from brussels in exchange for staying in the bloc . 
  members with weaker economies , meanwhile , may have less choice in the matter , since they would likely be the first casualties of any new eu crisis to arise . 
  by and large , eu members can be divided into four categories of countries based on the likelihood and consequences of their departure from the union . 
  ** the outsiders ** in recent years , some of the european union 's harshest critics have been central and eastern european members that do not belong to the eurozone . 
  many of these countries view the european union as a pact among states that should remain sovereign , and they have guarded their national powers from brussels ' ever-expanding reach . 
  hungary and poland lead the pack in their resistance to deeper european integration , but states like the czech republic , romania and bulgaria have become similarly skeptical of the eurozone and proposals to increase brussels ' authority . 
  this is not to say that these countries are willing to desert the bloc . 
  all are net receivers of eu aid and subsidies , and they see eu membership as a route to modernizing their economies and attracting foreign investment . 
  some even view the bloc as a guarantee of the west 's protection against russian aggression . 
  the majority of voters in the region , moreover , still support the idea of staying in the european union . 
  nevertheless , central and eastern european states will not hesitate to assert their national rights and advocate weaker eu institutions . 
  their opposition to integration will lend momentum to euroskeptic movements across the continent seeking to renegotiate terms with brussels . 
  over time , persistent anti-eu rhetoric could boost nationalist and populist forces in the region , cornering governments into making decisions that may run counter to their strategic goals . 
  if people are going to accept the relocation quotas , the eu first needs to show that it 's able to reduce the stream of economic migrants and send back those who made it here and that is not entitled to stay . 
  currently far too few economic migrants are returned and end up staying illegally . 
  the first focus needs to be on sending back those that do n't get to stay , and then should we focus on relocation , not the other way around . 
  on the contrary , i care about refugees ; i think we should help as many as them as possible . 
  and that 's exactly why we need to reduce immigration pressure into europe and send back economic migrants . 
  housing refugees in europe costs way too much , and people get tired of seeing their tax money used to house people who obviously should n't be here , either because they 're economic migrants or actual war refugees that bypass dusins of safe countries and seek refugee in those with the best economic support . 
  germany alone is planning on spending more money on the refugees they got last year than whole budget om unhcr , which provides food and shelter for millions of refugees . 
  and yet the eu should have much more leverage than norway did . 
  afghanistan obviously buckled when they realised they 'd not be getting anymore aid . 
  norway is currently deporting about 80 % of all aghanis asylum seekers , and the minister of immigration has made it clear that that number will continue to rise as even stricter deportation laws are put into place . 
  less than 5 % of all iraqi asylum seekers are given asylum , the rest are sent back . 
  the eu needs to stop pussyfooting around and use its economic power to get stuff done . 
  it 's far to slow and impotent to do anything useful without it taking years . 
  which is what we did , several years ago . 
  it 's laughable that the eu struggles to project power outside europe , even on matters were there is a large amount of understanding and agreement between members . 
  whats the point of given up sovereignty when the super-national block is so utter shit at getting stuff done ? 
  norway managed to make iraq , afghanistan and even pakistan to take back their refused migrants , and we 're like 5.2 million people . 
  good , this is what the eu should spend its time on , and not the stupid relocation quotas . 
  norway is already deporting many afghanis . 
  i find it difficult to understand why it took so long for the eu to get the same sort of deal . 
  edit : now the focus should be on creating/retooling frontex an eu-wide deportation agency which is tasked with deported rejected asylum seekers from dublin signatories . 
  they 'll provide the necessary papers , id checks , getting the final go ahead from `` recipients '' and carry through the actual deportations . 
  use foreign aid/trade as a leverage to make countries take back their citizens and get eu-wide deportation agreements . 
  so the options given to the government is either referendum by choice or referendum by force . 
  i remember when the company i worked in went bankrupt during the financial crisis . 
  the ceo had a nice pep talk in the morning , saying all was fine and the everything was under control . 
  we were told to clean out our desks by 14 o clock the same day . 
  the court ( s ) , not the government itself , said no because the legal system was asked to rule on something that is currently a non-issue . 
  snowden basically asked to be given a guarantee that he would not be extradited by norway if someone asked us to do so . 
  the court ruled that it could not do so , as it an extradition would depend entirely on the evidence presented to the court . 
  in a nutshell it 's like asking to be given a guarantee that you can not be found guilty of a crime that you may or may not have committed before the prosecution is allowed to logde a case in the legal system . 
  he probably should n't come , knowing our current , and also previous government , they 'd either hand i 'm over to the americans as soon as he crosses the border or look the other way when a cia van pulls up and `` picks him up '' , approved extradition or not . 
  that 's it then , they 'll let deutsche bank go belly up no matter what !, 
  / s seriously though , they 're incredibly stupid if they let any bank carrying a system risk go under . 
  i get the whole banker need to learn their lessons and not depend on taxpayers when they get too greedy deal , but they simply ca n't let big important banks go under . 
  the eurozone is struggling as it is , and the banking system in most of southern europe is down the toilet already . 
  deutsche bank or another big bank going under is going to make the 2008 crash look nice in comparison . 
  well , of course not , but it 's going to be more difficult politically to force hungary to accept migrants if the government can show that a majority of the population in hungary opposes it . 
  any sort of sanction that would require unanimous support would probably be stopped by poland who banks on hungary doing the same if the eu carries through with threads of punishing poland for its `` non-democratic '' actions lately . 
  gadaffi giveth and sarokozy taketh away . 
  good luck convincing the french that english is the way to go . 
  exactly . 
  their plans will assume that we make rational and well-thought out counter moves , and the the enemy lay their plans accordingly . 
  germany and denmark jointly invading poland by mistake is sure to confuse whoever attacks us . 
  the apparent lack of any sort of coordination is sure to confuse the enemy . 
  we shall find strength in disunity and distrust among members . 
  the fact they germany refuses to change the eu regulations on banking bailouts is preventing italy from saving its banks is not making it easier for merkel to step in . 
  the whole thing is really messy . 
  tldr : european banks went through a hard time during the financial crisis of 2008 , and then again during the euro crisis . 
  the problem has been made worse by the ecb 's extremely expansive money policy that has driven return on safe papers into negative territory . 
  db has been bleeding money for the last years , and may not be able to cover operating costs or build the necessary capital buffer to cover non-performing loans . 
  in addition db keeps being hit by fines for illegal/immoral business practices . 
  they 're currently facing a 14 billion usd fine for their role in 2008 financial crisis . 
  not necessarily , it depends on the condition of the bail ( out/in ) . 
  equity owners will probably have their assets going through nasty a haircut . 
  db collapsing is not an option , it would decimate the whole european banking sector . 
  merkel is in a tough spot , she has repeatedly said she 's not going to intervene , but if db is about to fail she has no other choice . 
  sarkozy is on fire with his election talk . 
  so , what would a new treaty actually entail ? 
  i 'm probably not being totally objective here , but nasams is a great system . 
  it 's small , highly mobile and can be setup in a multitude of configurations . 
  it can be used to cover small individual areas or several launchers and radar stations can be chained together to increase coverage . 
  he 's probably just waiting for more favorable winds .
