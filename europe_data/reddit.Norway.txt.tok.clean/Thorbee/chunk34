  news flash ; eu is not a single country with a single government , the others you listed are . 
  the good old `` forced solidarity '' , sounds like something the soviet union would come up with . 
  i think you mean eu/europe and not eurozone . 
  eurozone is the monetary union and excludes several eu countries . 
  better double down on it then , that seems to be the current tactic . 
  the relocation quota is still a success . 
  well , they all say that . 
  [ no ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/lsu/?uri=celex:32014l0049 ) that is not the case :  deposits are covered per depositor per bank . 
  this means that the limit of $ 100,000 applies to all aggregated accounts at the same bank . 
  for joint accounts ( e.g. 
  belonging to a couple ) , the $ 100 ,000 limit applies to each depositor . 
   some deposits -- such as those linked to life events such as marriage , divorce , retirement , redundancy , invalidity or death -- may be protected above $ 100,000 for a limited period of time ( at least 3 months and no more than 12 months ) . 
  why do you think our minister of finance has been pushing for an extension to the 2018 deadline ? 
  so that we get to keep our 2 million nok limit before dropping it to the , you claim , allowed 2 million nok ? 
  give me a break . 
  the 100k euro is the minimum and the maximum limit . 
  edit : [ here 's more ] ( http://www.bankenessikringsfond.no/report-from-the-board-of-directors/category942.html ) from the banking fund itself :  the deposit guarantee in the eu is eur 100,000 . 
  norway has previously sought to amend to the directive 's text to permit retention of a guarantee level of nok 2 million per depositor per bank . 
  the directive allows a transitional period until the end of 2018 for guarantee funds with guarantee level of more than eur 100 000 ( in practice only relevant for norway ) . 
  i get that those of you with eu flags are tired of the eu getting treated unfairly , but you 've got to accept that the eu can be shitty at times , and this is one example of that . 
  what was untrue about that ? 
  look at the sources i linked further down this thread . 
  bottom line is this ; the eu mandates that the deposit guarantee of norwegian banks is lowered , thus reducing our rights in the event of a banking collapse . 
  [ nope ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/financial-supervision-and-risk-management/managing-risks-banks-and-financial-institutions/deposit-guarantee-schemes_en ) , 100k euro is the limit , both upper and the lower limit . 
  our minister of finance has been trying to get a waiver , arguing that 100k euro is worth more to someone in for example hungary than for a norwegian . 
  no luck there . 
  we 've gotten an extension to 2018 , and we 're now trying to either push it to 2020 , or get the upper limit dropped completely , though the eu is not budging . 
   there , fixed that for you . 
  welcome to the 21st century btw , old noble landholder . 
  nope , the eu is still fucking us in the ass on this one , talking about solidarity and all the nice stuff . 
  edit : [ here is more ] ( http://www.bankenessikringsfond.no/report-from-the-board-of-directors/category942.html ) from the norwegian bank fund itself . 
   the deposit guarantee in the eu is eur 100,000 .

  we 're seeing another excellent example in norway of the eu forcing citizens to accept worse/poorer rights under the guise of solidarity . 
  in the event of a bank going bankrupt , a state mandated and partially run [ fund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_banks%27_guarantee_fund ) ensures that every deposit up to 2mnok ( 220k euro ) is guaranteed . 
  now the eu is forcing us to drop that amount to 100k euro , to adhere to the eu standard . 
  so now , if a bank goes bankrupt , you can end up loosing 120k euro ; thanks to the eu and its asinine regulation of markets . 
  why the fuck do they intervene in fully functioning markets and regulations , forcing citizens , to accept something that gives them less rights ? 
  i can now find solace in the fact that my rights are equally bad to that of a hungarian , thanks eu !, 
  all our rights are now equally bad . 
  must be this solidarity and strength of a common policy the keep talking on about / s, 
  but that creates an overlap between the ep and the council ? 
  that makes it even more messy . 
  i 'm talking about the ones you listed , and not schulz . 
  we get it , they are/were all shitty candidates . 
  does n't stop people from wanting a better one . 
  the commission wants to push whatever changes through without a treaty change , and i have a really hard time seeing that being possible without bending the rules and reinterpreting things in ways that was never meant to be . 
  on the other hand , the commission is pretty good at that . 
  which can work if we 're talking about a two-speed eu . 
  however , if were talking about a multi speed/ala carte eu , the whole thing is just going to get really messy . 
   quite how a top speed group will function when it comes to , as you point out , the eu parliament i ca n't imagine . 
  let me guess , they 're gon na further marginalize the ep . 
  lovely . 
  great , you can order pizza while shitting . 
  truly civilized !, 
  changes in terms of number of seats is pretty small , though enf ( europe of nations and freedom ) goes from 40 to 51 seats . 
  ah , yes . 
  the flawless plan to wean europe off of russian gas ; building even more pipelines to transfer russian gas into the heart of the continent . 
  still , le pen `` only '' getting 40 % in the second round is quite a dramatic rise compared to 2002 . 
  it really shows how fn has become more acceptable to the electorate . 
  le pen might actually have a chance in the 2022 election . 
  she was actually swedish, 
  looks like my ex . 
  i do n't know , pedaling for 8 + hours just to keep the engines going sounds tiring . 
  probably better wait for the election cycle to complete . 
  a le pen victory would mess up the whole thing . 
  well done denmark !, 
  just cut the brake wires of his wheel chair ? 
  the government would probably survive such a move , at least when we 're close to a new election cycle . 
  the last budget negotiations almost collapsed when venstre and the christian 's people party got pissed off at the government for , among things , cutting foreign aid . 
  the largest opposition party , labour , does not want to step in right before an election , it would just get really messy and if would totally throw off their plans for the election cycle . 
  obviously we 'd have to pass a budget somehow , but the opposition does n't really want to topple the government right now , so close to the election . 
  they 'd most likely work out some sort of deal were a budget is passed , with some minor adjustments to please the opposition . 
  nope , they 're on your soil , you deal with them . 
  no worries , it 's just a stupid joke , 
  osloomr\u00e5det is actually correct ( literally oslo area for those of you who do n't speak germanic languages ) problem is that we already have an informal `` osloomr\u00e5det '' , comprising of the area around oslo , though i would be in favor of expanding oslo slightly and splitting `` viken '' into an eastern and western part . 
  [ jarlsberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jarlsberg ) actually used to occupy about half of vestfold . 
  that 's before we outlawed the nobility . 
  and underwater, 
  what , did they forget to attach wings this time ? 
  i messed up the translation . 
  i 'm in fact referring to `` venstre '' , literary `` left '' . 
  turns out their name in english is actually [ liberal party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_party_ ( norway \\ ) ) . 
  not to be mistaken with [ socialist left ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_left_party_ ( norway \\ ) ) . 
  venstre has been really uneasy about the current government , which they support in order to pass a budget . 
  they do n't really like the progress party ( our populist right party ) being in government , but they 've sucked it up so far to gain some political wins . 
  bavaria - the texas of germany . 
  fylker/regions are , among other things , responsible for county roads , public transportation , health/medical related services , though certain parts of these fall under municipal jurisdictions , secondary schools , conservation of historical sites and so on . 
  they 're a weird middleman between the state and municipalities . 
  nope . 
  or , well , actually . 
  there 's a western part of akershus that borders buskerud that is not connected to the rest of akershus , but cut off by oslo . 
  to drive from the western parts of akershus you have to pass into oslo and then into akershus again . 
  currently buskerud and `` eastern '' akershus separated by a 4.5 kilometers piece of oppland wedged between them . 
   and what is the reason ? 
  the conservative party has been harping on about a reform of our municipalities and counties for decades now . 
  they 're in power and need to deliver . 
  norway currently has 426 municipalities , some of which are very small . 
  the theory is that by combining municipalities great cost saving will occur .
