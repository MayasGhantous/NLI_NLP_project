  they 've been under british rule for 300 years , and they 've voted to remain that way . 
  i agree that it 's weird as hell to have a tiny piece of land connected to spain belonging to another island nation far away , but that battle is lost , no need to pour salt into old wounds . 
   breaking the promise at this point is virtually impossible . 
  hence why he could step down if a coalition with pvv becomes the only viable way to get a government  we 're up for a rainbow indeed !, 
  good luck with that , seems like it could become a real circus . 
  then it 's time to brace for a real rainbow of a coalition . 
  ofc , rutte could either break his promise or just step down as leader and let someone else form a coalition with pvv . 
  i like tusk !, 
  a bit rough around the edges at times , but seems like a pretty sensible guy most of the time . 
  he 's also not a never ending pr disaster like juncker is, 
  in my experience , every european male that is not from northern europe are all certified carpenters , electricians and plumbers . 
  pretty impressive . 
  it 's mostly driven by high labor costs . 
  for every krone/crown a worker is payed , the total cost of labor for the company employing them is about double that due to regulations , pension fund payments , insurance and numerous other social and financial costs . 
  why hire a carpenter through a firm , when you can hire the exact same carpenter and pay him `` under the table '' for half of the original cost . 
  the carpenter gets a bigger cut , since he wo n't report it as taxable income , and the ones buying the service will pay less since you wo n't have to pay for the actual labor , the company 's cut and social costs . 
  i remember when we had a huge discussion in norway whether to buy american or swedish jet fighters . 
  we had a guy on prime time television say that we might as well buy american fighters `` as the americans have lots of experience bombing civilians and military forces alike , sweden does n't '' . 
  thanks , i really messed that up . 
  i usually get it right . 
   maybe . 
  they might also use idas , the newer batch of u121as already can launch them from the torpedo tubes and they seem to have some land attack capability . 
  seems like the idas is also well suited for air targets , and i do n't think nsm or any of the derivatives is designed for air targets . 
  using both idas and nsm should yield the capability to take down boats , helicopters/slow aircraft , and ground targets . 
  pretty sweet combo . 
   but it seems that germany agreed to take nsm for the upcomming mk181 frigate class instead of the previously planned rbs15 as part of the overall deal . 
  haha , we 're really trying to push nsm and it 's derivatives for everythning !, 
  bolt them onto stealth planes , submarines , corvettes , frigates , sub marines , ground launchers , it can do everything !, 
  yeah , we 're currently developing a sub launched version of the [ nsm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naval_strike_missile ) , and they 're looking into vertical launches , like icbms , or just plain old torpedo tube launch . 
  one of the possible changes include a vertical launcher for the missiles . 
  it 's already clear we 're buying german ones . 
   [ t ] he eurozone 's rescue funds , have disbursed $ 174bn to greece . 
  we would not have lent this amount if we did not think we would get our money back . 
  lol , do you want your money back by this century , or the next one ? 
   i thought it was already quite clear that this stuff was happening around europe , almost a year ago . 
  it has been happening for decades , and the authorities have looked the other way . 
   why is the eurozone back in crisis over greece ? 
  because the so-called rescue packages did n't solve the fundemental issue ; greece has too much debt . 
  instead they 're throwing even more debt at greece . 
  they need to write off a huge chunk of it for the crisis to be resolved . 
  local authorities in libya 's capital city tripoli and elsewhere are mounting resistance to eu plans to stem migration flows towards italy . 
  the move is likely to further complicate efforts after the eu 's foreign policy chief federica mogherini announced a $ 200 million plan to finance migration projects geared towards libya throughout much of north africa . 
  a large bulk of the money is likely to be shuffled into border control and surveillance in the hope of containing people likely to attempt the perilous mediterranean sea crossing in the upcoming months . 
  but mostafa al-barooni , the mayor of one of the largest cities in the country , told this website on wednesday ( 8 february ) that mogherini 's proposals were unacceptable . 
  `` it is not acceptable and it is not logical that we should solve the problem of europe by keeping the migrants and refugees in libya , '' he said . 
  al-barooni presides over zintan , a city in the north-west of country , which is home to some 20,000 migrants . 
  his views were echoed by ibrahim aribi , a city councillor from tripoli , the seat of the un-recognised government of national accord , the gna . 
  `` it is the european union that is responsible for the illegal migrants , '' aribi told euobserver . 
  `` we do n't agree with these plans , '' he said . 
  aribi said the eu 's migration proposals risked creating `` huge problems for libya . '', 
  `` if all these refugees can not go further and stay in libya , it will worsen the situation , '' he said . 
  the two said eu assistance for libya should instead aim to create jobs and tackle day-to-day issues such as waste management . 
  ** no legal path to eu from libya ** eu leaders , earlier this month in malta , said they would `` stem illegal flows into the eu '' and `` combat transit and smuggling activities '' , but made no mention of helping people to find legal ways to seek asylum in europe . 
  it means that people hoping to reach the eu will continue to rely on smugglers . 
  the eu is keen to cooperate with libyan municipal authorities , which are viewed as being vital to implementing its new african projects , but with local authorities opposing the plans to keep migrants at bay , it is unclear how the european initiatives can proceed . 
  al-barooni and arib 's comments come ahead of a ceremony in malta where mogherini is handing over graduation certificates to 89 trainees in the libyan coast guard and navy . 
  the trainees are among the first batch in an eu plan to get the libyans to pluck migrants from within their own territorial waters and return them to libya . 
  but once returned , they are likely to end up in detention facilities that were recently described as death-traps by the german government . 
  officially , libya has 34 detention centres but sources on the ground say the real number is between 20 and 27 . 
  `` if there is a conflict , migrants are moved to another centre , so it depends , '' said international organisation of migration ( iom ) chief of mission to libya , othman belbeisi . 
  ** failed state and international aid ** another part of the eu plan to keep migrants in place is to enlist international aid organisations like the un refugee agency ( unhcr ) and iom for help . 
  but the unhcr has no international staff in libya . 
  the agency has people working in somalia and afghanistan but refuses to send anyone to libya for extended stays because it is too dangerous . 
  it instead relies on local hires to carry out services . 
  the iom has 81 staff present in libya and 115 dedicated mission staff but faces similar restrictions . 
  the iom 's libya 's mission chief belbeisi , for instance , is based in tunisia . 
  `` even for me , i can not go to libya and stay for a number of days , '' he said . 
  belbeisi said they are able to work around the problems with different contractual agreements for staffing inside the country . 
  `` we are taking some risks trying to have people on the ground under different contractual modalities , '' he said . 
  the iom works primarily with the libyan coast guard and a so-called directorate for combating illegal migration . 
  the organisation wants to set up reception facilities for people rescued at sea where they can receive a meal and quick shower before being released a few hours later . 
  belbeisi said that those rescued are often sent immediately to the detention centres . 
  `` this is something that we advocate that authorities should stop but it continues to happen , '' he said . 
  thanks , i think . 
  not sure if sarcasm or not . 
  i 'm just a bit cynical at times . 
  you can rest when you 're dead . 
  now , pay back germany , you leaches !, 
  i think everyone 's left ear will enjoy [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kekpe05lx2k ), 
  do n't worry , i hear there 's something called `` structural reforms '' that are supposed to fix problems like that . 
  well , my local grocery store does have a sign up saying that they 're sorry for the limited amounts of broccoli on the shelves , due to bad weather in spain , but there 's no rationing , you can buy all the cases of them if you want to . 
   but if everyone starts cutting their own deals on their own terms , you undercut the negotiating power of the union . 
  i totally get that , but the problem still remains ; the eu always makes huge trade deals , because it represents all it 's members collective goods and services , such large trade deals take a long time . 
  for a country that only wants and needs a small trade deal , with focus on certain exports , they can probably get that done in a fraction of the time it takes for the eu to go through all the stages of pre-negotiation , negotiation , feedback from national governments , adjustments and then finally ratification . 
  if you want to export goods form a very limited subset , such a long wait is not very productive . 
   this is one of the major upsides of being in the eu , so that our teeny tiny nation does n't have to make bilateral trade agreements with economic giants like china and usa , getting terrible conditions . 
  but what if you actually want to make one ? 
  if you 're a small country with a limited set of exports and viable imports from a another big nation . 
  we regularly see that the eu wide trade deals take decades to hash out , since they encompass almost everything the collective eu produces and imports . 
  a small country could viable get a deal done in a couple of years for a limited set of goods and perhaps services , and move on . 
  there 's a difference between being forced into making bilateral agreement that do n't serve you well and being forced into not making bilateral agreements that you want to make . 
  this time it 's going to be in the northern direction , and not southern . 
  and it 's not even square !, 
  this will not end well , that 's for sure . 
  ehh ... strudel ? 
  probably not , but the most likely way forward is the following : we embark on an attempt to renegotiate parts of the eea agreement , we wo n't get any big concessions , but labour and the conservative party will try to act like we did . 
  this may or may not work , though i find it most likely that the anti eu/eea side will use it as proof that the eea is not for us , saying that they want us to replace it by a trade deal . 
  the whole thing is going to take time , any renegotiation attempt will probably come after the 2022 election , leaving 4 years to get it done in time for the next election cycle . 
  if that fails the 2026 election would then become about eea or just a trade deal . 
  bottom line is , i do n't see us leaving the eea until the period 2025-2030 .
