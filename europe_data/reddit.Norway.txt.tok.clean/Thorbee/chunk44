  so if they accept this and then raise taxes to compensate for this , who 's the dick ? 
  the one ( s ) who say ( s ) it will not increase taxes for eu citizens is/are the dick ( s ) . 
  there 's no way in hell that nation states will accept to have more of their revenue being passed to brussels without making up for that shortfall somehow . 
  well , that took like forever for them to realize it was a shitty proposal to begin with . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  i 'm saying that they finally get to implement something they 've longed to do for quite a while , whilst blaming the capital shortfall of brexit for its inception . 
  truth be told , it 's a tax as a result of the funding shortfall caused by brexit . 
  calling it a brexit tax , although not what the eu will call it , is not entirely unfair . 
  an increase in vat by 1 % point is 1 % point increase in cost of consumption , it 's not nothing . 
  i 'm not opposed to such a tax . 
  i 'm opposed to people trying to pass it off as literally costing nothing when it certainly does . 
  look at what the treturous brits made us do !, 
   eu officials stressed yesterday that the reforms would not lead to higher tax bills for eu citizens , as they would be offset against national taxes . 
  and what do these eu officials think will happen to the shortfall experienced by the national states ? 
  they 'll recuperate those through new/raised taxes . 
  be completely honest from the start ; the proposed changes will lead to an increase in taxes on the common european citizen . 
  beating around the bush like that is why people are increasingly taking a dislike towards politicians and brussels . 
  imagine if we would actually jail and fine these executives . 
  sad to see them use europe as a safe haven were they can avoid prosecution . 
  ** forecast ** * the euroskeptic party of freedom is polling strongly ahead of the dutch general election in march , but the netherlands is unlikely to unilaterally decide to leave the european union or the eurozone . 
  * in the coming months , the netherlands will face multiple challenges , from brexit negotiations to the reform of the european union and limiting the influence of its southern members . 
  * the netherlands is unlikely to act alone and will coordinate its decisions with its main allies in northern europe . 
  ** analysis ** a series of national elections over the next few months will help decide the future of the european union . 
  the bloc 's two largest economies , germany and france , will hold elections and , depending on the status of its fragile government , its third-largest , italy , may join them . 
  kicking it all off , however , is the netherlands , whose voters will go to the polls on march 15 . 
  in the netherlands , as in many other eu countries , nationalist and euroskeptic parties are performing well in opinion polls . 
  even still , a dutch withdrawal from the european union or the eurozone is unlikely . 
  in recent years , elections in many european countries have shown that popular support for mainstream political parties is waning as anti-system and euroskeptic forces are gaining popularity . 
  the netherlands , one of the wealthiest countries in europe , is following this trend . 
  its parliament is composed of numerous parties , and coalitions are often needed to form governments . 
  according to opinion polls , in the coming election , the ruling people 's party for freedom and democracy of prime minister mark rutte would win from 23 to 28 of the 150 seats in the dutch parliament . 
  this would be a significant decline from the 41 seats it won in the general election of 2012 . 
  similarly , the labor party would win 10 to 12 seats , well below the 38 seats it obtained in the last election . 
  in the meantime , polls suggest that the parliamentary representation of the euroskeptic party of freedom would double , reaching between 29 and 35 seats ( in 2012 , it won only 15 seats ) . 
  that party and its leader , geert wilders , want the netherlands to leave the european union ( a so-called nexit ) and to reintroduce the guilder as its national currency . 
  the party has a strong anti-immigration and anti-muslim agenda , presenting itself as a protector of dutch culture and identity . 
  but even if the party of freedom performs strongly in the election , it would struggle to enter the government . 
  most mainstream dutch political parties refuse to cooperate with wilders and have said they will exclude the party of freedom from the negotiations to form a government . 
  the party of freedom is the only major party advocating a nexit ; the rest of the political establishment remains committed to the netherlands ' eu membership and its role as the heart of the process of european integration . 
  ** the dutch and the eu ** in 1957 , the netherlands joined west germany , france , italy , belgium and luxembourg to help create the european economic community , the european union 's forerunner . 
  in the early 2000s , it was a part of the first group of countries that adopted the euro as their currency . 
  one of the european union 's most important treaties , the treaty of maastricht , takes its name after the dutch city where it was signed in 1992 . 
  this is connected to the netherlands ' geopolitical strategy . 
  its location in northern europe and access to multiple waterways made it immensely rich but also left it vulnerable to militarily powerful neighbors such as germany , france and the united kingdom . 
  because it lacked significant protective geographic barriers , invasion has been a constant threat . 
  so the dutch turned to diplomacy and trade to protect their small country , which became the center of a balance of power in europe that would keep its enemies at bay . 
  after world war ii , this strategy led it to support european integration . 
  but the dutch have doubts about the current state of continental integration . 
  according to a recent survey by the pew research center , 46 percent of the dutch population has an unfavorable view of the continental bloc , with 49 percent disapproving of the way it is dealing with european economic issues . 
  the survey also shows that only one in four dutch voters want their country to transfer additional powers to brussels . 
  the bloc 's political crisis certainly influences dutch views of it , but dutch voters have a history of skepticism when it comes to deepening the process of integration . 
  in a 2005 referendum , the dutch voted against a plan to introduce an eu constitution . 
  but dissatisfaction with aspects of the european union does not necessarily mean wanting to leave it . 
  for most dutch voters , the idea of making the bloc more efficient , more accountable and more democratic is still more attractive than the idea of leaving it altogether . 
  another important factor is that the netherlands ' economy depends heavily on foreign trade . 
  the dutch economy is deeply intertwined with that of europe . 
  germany alone receives almost a quarter of dutch exports , with fellow eu and eurozone members belgium and france as large trade partners . 
  in other words , the netherlands is unlikely to decide to leave the european union unilaterally , because its economy and security depend on preserving free trade in europe and keeping close ties with its immediate neighbors . 
  ** the netherlands post-election ** the coming dutch election will most likely result in a government that calls for eu reform instead of the abolishment of the bloc . 
  the netherlands is likely to side with other northern european countries and push for reforms to reduce red tape in europe , limit the power of the central institutions in brussels , defend free trade within the continent , push for better protection of the bloc 's external borders to reduce immigration , and pressure countries in southern europe to comply with the bloc 's deficit and debt targets . 
  but even though a nexit seems improbable , election results will still present significant challenges for the netherlands . 
  first , a stronger-than-expected performance by the party of freedom would increase its leverage during the negotiations to form a government . 
  even if wilders does not become prime minister , his party could become indispensable in providing parliamentary support to a minority government led by moderate forces . 
  this was the case between 2010 and 2012 , when the party of freedom provided external support to a minority center-right government . 
  should wilders increase his influence over the political process , the netherlands would move to increasingly euroskeptic positions . 
  in addition , britain 's departure from the european union will deprive the dutch government of a key ally when it comes to defending free trade and pushing for institutional reform within the bloc . 
  northern european countries fear that britain 's departure could shift the balance of power in the european union from the north to the south , increasing the influence of countries such as france , italy and spain . 
  the perception that a `` mediterranean bloc '' has taken control of the european union could lead to increased euroskepticism not only in the netherlands but also in countries such as germany or finland . 
  the brexit will also create economic challenges for the netherlands . 
  the united kingdom is one of the netherlands ' main trading partners , and the dutch will support london when it comes to negotiating the broadest and deepest possible access for britain to eu markets . 
  should the united kingdom leave without striking an agreement on tariff-free trade , dutch exports would take a hit . 
  but brexit negotiations will also put the dutch government in a dilemma : if the united kingdom gets a beneficial exit package significantly reducing the pain of its departure , euroskeptic forces in the netherlands will use it as a success story that proves leaving the bloc does not lead to much economic distress . 
  the brexit also offers opportunities to the netherlands , as some financial companies that currently operate in london could transfer some activities to attractive financial centers elsewhere in europe , such as amsterdam . 
  this would , however , probably require changes to dutch laws that limit bankers ' remuneration . 
  finally , the dutch government could also be forced to react to events outside its borders . 
  should a victory in coming months by euroskeptic forces in france or italy precipitate the collapse of the eurozone , the netherlands would seek cooperation with its closest allies ( including germany , belgium and luxembourg ) to plan for a post-eurozone world . 
  in late 2015 , dutch media revealed that the government discussed a proposal to create a `` mini schengen zone '' of visa-free travel that would include only a handful of countries in northern europe . 
  this is illustrative of the kind of thinking that pervades in the netherlands , whose leaders are aware of the country 's limited strategic options . 
  a midsize european country like the netherlands is more likely to seek cooperation with its main economic and political partners than to take dramatic unilateral actions . 
  and why ca n't that be solved through nato ? 
  every time europe faces some sort of problem the answer is always to pile yet another layer on top of the cake consisting of decades of political institutions and frameworks , some of which are hardly relevant anymore . 
  if nato has shortcomings , let 's actually address those instead of creating yet another partly overlapping , competing institution . 
   [ ... ] there is an incredible amount of redundancy , and consequently important projects do n't get enough funding . 
  yes , even with 2 % . 
  we can do that without adding yet another layer to the eu . 
  use nato to strike important standards , like we 've already done on munition calibers . 
  encourage members to place joint orders for material , such as f35 , to reduce cost and increase the homogeneity of the material on the battlefield . 
  that way you do n't run the risk of trying to load a french tank onto a german transport plane only to discover that the french tank is two centimeters too wide to fit . 
  all the problems you mention can be solved and should be solved through nato , and not by adding yet another layer on top of the already complicated political and geographical structures already in europe . 
  the us spends to ensure its geopolitical standing . 
  having russia occupying half of europe is not in its interest , thus it protects europe from russia . 
  they 're obviously not doing it from the good for their heart , but based on their interests . 
  the result is still the same ; the us keeps russia out . 
  because having an european defence project in addition to nato muddles the whole thing up . 
  we run the risk of having countries that are in nato but not in the edp or the other way around . 
  what about standards ? 
  are the edp to adapt the same equipment standards as nato , or will there be a set of different standards ? 
  command structure ? 
  will a nato action trigger an edp action and vice versa ? 
  also , the eu takes so fucking long to decide on something , why the fuck would a country place its protection into the hands of an organisation that spends immense amounts of time to agree on the smallest things ?
