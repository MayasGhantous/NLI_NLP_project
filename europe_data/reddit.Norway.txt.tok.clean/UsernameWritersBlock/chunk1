put it in a salad and serve it to the ioc vips at the opening ceremony . 
  i should move there to lose weight . 
  i guess that 's why we ca n't understand what they say . 
  he was caught red-handed . 
  sounds like norway ( though complaints were louder when labour was in government ) ; people dislike ties between unions and left-of-center parties , yet do n't mention the ties between trade organizations/rich tycoons and the right-of-center parties when they 're voicing their complaints ... 
  i stubbed my toe on that once when i was on holiday . 
  i ca n't tell from this picture if bears shit in the woods though . 
  probably because he lives down south ... 
  and everyone is driving on the wrong side of the road as well . 
  that 's why we hope he 'll commit some in norway ... 
  yeah , if they had paid attention at school they would have known that sweden is the capital of oslo ... 
  swedish police have so little to do that someone made a [ movie ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxc_3jtzoic ) about it . 
  unless you 're from norway ... 
  you misspelled osteh\u00f8vel ... 
   so many musicians playing romania 's capital have mistaken it for hungary 's and come on stage shouting `` how are you doing , budapest ? '' that locals have moved on from amused indulgence to being seriously pissed off . 
  i 'd like to think that a lot of that could be blamed on a tight schedule combined with jet lag and drugs/alcohol ... 
   the rich countries will have to subsidize the poor you mean tax payers of the rich countries would have to subsidize the rich of the poor countries ? 
  most of these poor eu countries are so corrupt that i refuse to believe it had nothing to do with the clusterfuck situation they 're in now ( but of course , blame germany and the imf for all their problems ) ... 
  i 'm gon na put some sprinkles on my butter ... 
  you also wo n't be allowed to bring them to russia . 
  wait for russians to invade 2 . 
  once they cross the border , attack them with slingshots 3 . 
  capture their tanks as they flee, 
  considering how russia fared against finland in 1939-40 , i find their fear to be rational .

  they should figure out how to make sunshine . 
  that 's what they really need during winter in those parts . . 
  hungary and serbia are not in the islamic world though . . 
   norwegian massacre gunman anders breivik stayed in such a penitentiary . 
  wtf ? 
  if this in anything like [ bast\u00f8y ] ( https://youtu.be/01mtkdaka6q?t=4m23s ) , then no , he did not stay in that prison or anything like it . 
  i see that we 're a bit of a gray area ... 
  i 'm assuming by south of norway you mean [ queen maud land ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_maud_land ) ?

  they should have put a roundabout where the 3 borders meet . 
  but in scandinavia we do n't have alligators trying to eat us . 
  every word in the polish language for non-speakers = blue, 
  being drunk is no excuse .

  some random people in china say you were n't , so i 'm going to believe them . 
  that was then , but [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/upwhvzc ) is now . 
  i 'd much rather have this kind of cultural problem than the kind they do in countries where they 're not allowed to drink . 
  but you have to admit , if bill gates gave you a dollar , you 'd be damn proud of that dollar !, 
  but then you also have to consider the size of the people ... 
  i always thought it was woman-carrying . 
  there 's water in the bathroom . 
  people should start bringing onboard kettles and instant coffee . 
  i heard they did n't like gays . 
  or diluted with vodka . 
  probably migrating birds . 
  minimum wage in myanmar was set to $ 2.8 per 8 hour day last year , which means $ 0.35 per hour . 
  people on these kind of wage levels are probably more interested in working 14 hours for $ 4.9 per day than 8 hours for $ 2.8 . 
  does bombs dropped on roads , hospitals and schools in the middle east count ?

  i think one lesson would be to let it have consequences when someone who have been granted asylum one place continues to another to try their luck there because the benefits are better , his friends are there etc. 
  it should lead to immediate refusal of asylum in the last country , obviously , but should also have consequences for the asylum which was granted in the first country . 
  `` oh , this was n't good enough for you ? 
  you wanted to go somewhere else ? 
  well , you had your chance . 
  now it 's revoked '' . 
  and despite all that , `` smug atheists '' are `` the worst '' . 
  worse than islamic suicide bombers . 
  it 's not even noon yet . 
   i ca n't tell if the percentage refers to to total number of criminals caught in norway or just the foreign ones . 
  it refers to people who are caught in oslo for committing `` for profit crimes '' ( burglary , theft , scimming etc. 
  but not rape , violence , vandalism etc. ) . 
  most of the people who are caught for this are foreigners . 
   is 70 % of all criminal activity in norway , oslo done by romanians or does the 70 % refer to the percentage of romanians who do illegal activities among foreign criminals . 
  from the 2013 article , 745 of those apprehended in oslo were romanian citizens , 109 were polish , and 62 from algeria . 
  those were the top 3 nationalities - i do n't know what position norwegians held on the list since it 's not published in the article , but i think it 's safe to say that norwegians who commit these types of crimes are almost always doing it to feed a drug habit , and are vastly outnumbered by foreign criminals . 
   about the racism : i was n't talking in a legal way . 
  i read comments from people on reddit that in closed circles or on the news it 's okay to badmouth romanians while refugees and muslims are tabu . 
  this would depend what kind of closed circle you 're in i suppose . 
  i doubt anyone who would be fine bad-mouthing one group would have problems doing it to the other as well . 
  the news i would have to say are mostly neutral in their language , and will report anything bad regardless of who commits it . 
  as almost anywhere else , the news will sometimes be accused of being biased , but i do n't think it 's a big problem if at all . 
  the debates that pop up on the news sites afterwards are a different story , but after the terrorist attacks on 22 . 
  july 2011 , these have been moderated by the sites more strictly . 
  google butchers the translation to english , but i doubt it will do a better job to romanian , so it 's probably best to run the english translation .
