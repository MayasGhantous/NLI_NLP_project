  too common . 
  many wear too much . 
  i ca n't stand it . 
  luckily there are still a few naturals walking around . 
  that most eu countries use the same currency because it makes travelling a lot easier . 
  tldr ; superior at everything except for bad things, 
  look into it ( or do n't , keep believing msm 's lies because it 's easier ), 
  typical leftists to downvote rather than come with a counter-argument or answer . 
  brilliant, 
  eu = third reich in disguise = leader of germany = leader of eu countries . 
  i do n't see how putin would possibly rule your country , but i suppose it takes too much thinking for a leftist like yourself and your downvote army to see through the destabilizing propaganda from across the pond . 
   ridiculous associations so you 're a troll . 
  makes sense now, 
  so you 'd rather have merkel rule your country ? 
  nice logic, 
  why would there be any anger towards russia ? 
  i prefer czechia because it 's easier to say , the same way i prefer russia over the russian federation and norway over the kingdom of norway . 
  before my mom visits you mean ? 
  no , no i do n't . 
  as in a great place to live , yes . 
  no , coincidentally having a lot of oil on our territory is down to luck and is nothing to be proud of . 
   it means that the problem stems beyond just immigration , it means that something needs to be done for greater assimilation . 
  absolutely spot on buddy . 
  the problem is not immigration , because south/north americans , most asians and fellow europeans cause very little trouble when moving around europe or elsewhere . 
  the problem is islam , the culture most muslims come from and the fact that many of them are unwilling to let go off that culture . 
  i would suggest that we work with finland to take control of sweden . 
  it involves bizarre food . 
  ola nordmann ( male ) kari nordmann ( female ) ola and kari are popular names and nordmann means norwegian, 
  i 've been to asia , na and africa and most of my friends have been outside europe at least once in their life , usually somewhere in asia . 
  it ca n't be blamed on that , unfortunately . 
  if we count only african immigrants who have lived here for 10 ( !!! ), 
  years or longer , around 50 % are still unemployed . 
  i only use my microwave for heating leftover food from the day before or certain ready-to-eat food . 
  by continent norway 's immigrants are coming from europe ( 53 % ) , asia ( 30 % ) and africa ( 12 % ) . 
  also 3 % from south america and 1 % from north america . 
  by country poland is topping the list ( 100k ) , with countries like lithuania ( 40k ) , sweden ( 40k ) , somalia ( 30k ) and germany ( 20k ) behind . 
  39 % of immigrants comes here for family reasons , 33 % for work and 22 % are refugees . 
  in total we have 700-750k immigrants ( almost 15 % of our population ) . 
  personally i 'm quite happy with polish immigrants being the most common . 
  they work hard and do n't cause much trouble . 
  as for who 's the worst , those from african cultures have proved more likely to go unemployed for a long time etc , and that 's obviously costing our beloved welfare state more and more money . 
  in 2016 60 % of african immigrants were unemployed for example . 
  * the numbers are including immigrants with legal residency in norway * taken from [ ssb ] ( https://www.ssb.no/innvandring-og-innvandrere/nokkeltall ), 
  we have some good special forces and we 're one of the highest military spenders per capita , but we 're spending wrong and obviously do n't have an army big enough to stop an invasion from anyone . 
  our entire defence plan is to hold off invading forces until nato gets here ... 
  fair enough . 
  i 'll rephrase to `` bringing a dying war back to life '' . 
  i am not surprised a warmongering country is starting another war . 
  horrible decision , but as long as your beloved petrodollar remains it does n't matter to you how many lives are lost . 
  assad has no reason to gas his own people when he 's winning the war and trump said he will leave assad alone . 
  the rebels on the other hand have used chemicals weapons multiple times over the years and have motive - getting america back into syria to help them overthrow assad . 
  america have done this exact thing many times before and the left are falling for it again and again . 
  after some horrible act by < insert name of whatever person the us wants dead this time  you hear the same things . 
  us : `` we have reason to believe bla bla . 
  such horrible actions must be punished bla bla . 
  waiting for an investigation will take too long bla bla '' . 
  european us puppets : `` oh , well then it 's ok !, 
  bomb away ! '' . 
  history is repeating itself and leftists in europe fail to realise it . 
  leftists in us are orchestrating it . 
  the only witnesses to this chemical attack is a terrorist group who 's fighting assad - the same group who has been proven to use chemical weapons before , but let 's take their word for it even when they have all the motive in the world and assad do n't . 
  it 's rather obvious what 's happening and the fact that certain people fail to see it is very , very scary . 
  now before i 'm downvoted like crazy by this leftist friendly sub , i do not support assad in any way . 
  i do not believe he 's a great guy . 
  however i do believe that doing the exact same things you 've done before in other countries is not the solution - just look how those countries are doing now !, 
  if he 's fighting isis and whatever other terrorist groups are down there , we should do so with him ( or let him do so alone ) and focus on him later - and i do not mean focus as in assasinate because that has not worked out well in the past .

  definitely . 
  i do n't support an eu army , and that 's got nothing to do with my country not being in the eu . 
  i just do n't see the point when we have nato which even includes america and canada . 
  if nato starts falling apart though , then sure some sort of eu or european army would be nice . 
  i would however not go much further than have all countries just sign an agreement to use similar weapons , tanks etc and of course similar agreements like nato has that if one is attacked all will respond etc. . .  frankly , how willing are soldiers to die for a supranational political union ? 
  well , soldiers dying in the middle east is n't really dying for their country and they 're happy to fight there . 
  '' \u00c5 ta en spansk en '' ( to pull a `` spanish '' ) ( ? ), 
  it 's used when you take the easy way out or do n't do something properly . 
  bad example but say you 're putting your shoes on and ca n't be bothered to tie the shoelaces , so you just put the shoelaces in your shoes . 
  one would often say `` dette gidder jeg ikke , jeg tar en spansk en '' ( i ca n't be bothered with this , i 'm pulling a `` spanish '' ) . 
  it comes from back in the days when sailors often used a knot called `` spanish windlass '' that was considered a very simple knot , i think . 
   my final point is that americans eat shit . 
  there is no other way to say it . 
  oxfam has ranked the us 120 out of 125 for quality and health related food issues . 
  / thread, 
  hah , as if i would ever cheer for sweden !, 
  reading is the same , writing is faster as there are more words to choose from . 
  is it really that hard to see why they 're scared of a western invasion ( to use your words , i do n't think they are * scared * ) ? 
  the west have invaded other countries in the name of freedom and democracy , have n't they ? 
  the only reason they have n't assasinated putin yet like they 've done with other dictators ( because the west 's democracy system is the only system that is allowed to exist  ) is because of the massive nuclear arsenal he controls and unlike middle eastern or african countries , russia is very much capable of striking back . 
  norwegian and danish, 
  football, 
  `` jeg er en dame '' ( i am a lady ), 
  many times a day, 
  it 's common in the capital at least . 
  you 'll usually get away with a fine of a few hundred # / $ / $ if you 're carrying below 15 grams . 
  `` norwegian people are some of the kindest people you will ever meet ... . once you know them . 
  until you get to know them , they can quite possibly be the coldest , rudest people i have ever encountered . '', 
  * taken from an american travel blog * it 's just a cultural thing , at least here . 
  in my experience americans are more outgoing and do n't mind small talking with strangers, 
  public transportation in oslo is amazing , so for me a car would be like throwing money out the window . 
  one of our nordic friends would be too embarrassing . 
  i 'd go with switzerland .
