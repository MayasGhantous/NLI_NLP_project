  any country who allows foreign troops to set up base on their land should be embarrassed , imo . 
  i was taught uk english in school . 
  my teachers could never hide their norwegian accent when speaking though , so i only really learnt the written way in school . 
  i write both uk and us english . 
  i regularly start a paragraph with for example `` color '' and finish it with `` favourite '' . 
  it 's not a big deal to me . 
  i write whatever comes to mind first . 
  i speak a mixture of uk , us and australian english . 
  probably more uk/aus than us , but it depends who i 'm talking to and what i 'm saying ... again , i sometimes start the sentence with a us accent and switch to a uk one or the other way around without even realizing . 
  the national team plays there because it 's the biggest stadium we have ( 28k seats ) and it 's located in the capital . 
  there is one other stadium in the capital , but it 's in poor condition and is much smaller ( bislett stadion , 15k seats ) . 
  v\u00e5lerenga moved from bislett stadion to ullevaal stadion for good in 1999 or 2000 , because bislett was in too poor condition for a professional club to play there . 
  v\u00e5lerenga has been renting ullevaal ever since , but in a couple of months our own stadium will finally be finished ( 18k seats ) !, 
  :d [ illustration photo ] ( http://1.vgc.no/drpublish/images/article/2015/07/29/23496879/1/fullbredde/stadion.jpg ) [ actual live photo of it from yesterday ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/21f27bbe3b688da75b129a36fd123cfe.jpg ), 
  of course not . 
  v\u00e5lerenga ( local club ) and manchester united , yes . 
  many of us have a team we support outside of norway too , for various reasons . 
  i have a much stronger bond with my club than my national team . 
  i 've only been to three national team games but hundreds of club games even though they both play on the same stadium ten minutes away from me . 
  [ finn.no ] ( https://m.finn.no/realestate/homes/search.html?filters= ) . 
  it 's the biggest for everything ; homes , electronics , furniture , boats , cars , jobs etc. 
  if we for some strange reason talk about the moon europa , we say `` m\u00e5nen europa '' ( europa the moon ) . 
  otherwise europa refers to the continent, 
  it 's hilarious and dangerous, 
  my interpretation is that yours is ran like a business and ours like a. . . healthcare system ? 
  i pay 70 $ / month for 150/150 mbps and that 's the speed i get too . 
  `` under eu rules , a trader must repair , replace , reduce the price or give you a refund if goods you bought turn out to be faulty or do not look or work as advertised . '', 
  http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/guarantees-returns/index_en.htm so i believe they have to send it wherever in the eu you tell them to . 
   there was a phrase i used incorrectly in spanish for years and nobody told me i was wrong . 
  i was so embarrassed and upset that no one had cared enough to help me . 
  hah yeah i 've had that happen too !, 
  my only grammar rule is to never befriend a person who does not know the difference between your and you 're , there and their , writes should of instead of should 've / should have or uses `` yr '' instead of `` your '' etc. 
  other than that i leave people 's grammar alone , because grammar rules differ greatly from language to language . 
  i often see people complain that someone do n't capitalize certain letters in english , but that 's simply because many other languages do n't do that except for with names so it feels unnatural or is hard to remember . 
  for example `` english '' is not capitalized in many languages . 
  [ a norwegian politician did one a few years ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1aai0g/i_am_trine_skei_grande_member_of_parliament_and/?ref=search_posts&amp;st=izr19ak5&amp;sh=e2d2a489 ), 
  it makes me giggle, 
  for some reason that was a very hard question to answer , haha . 
  should be the easiest question in the world . 
  to live there would n't be too different from living in a very small town on the mainland i guess , except for the climate and polar bears ? 
  to be a tourist there vs on the mainland however is two very different experiences . 
  on the mainland you 'd go to one of the ` big ' cities , climb a mountain or see the fjords vs on svalbard you 'd go dog sledding , get on a boat to see icebergs , polar bears , walruses or whales and perhaps visit the old soviet mining town barentsburg where about 500 russians/ukranians still live . 
  not sure if that helped you at all haha , but hopefully it did  i enjoyed my time there at least . 
  it was something different compared to my usual big cities or sunny beaches type of vacation . 
  yes, 
  i prefer [ this ] ( https://www.google.no/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewip-qua_khsahuj1iwkhuujdqgqyckihtaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dl6cn8gfiz90&amp;usg=afqjcnekihcgbdbbvngwyszwu0fs_5kxia&amp;sig2=epqix-km2hxj1vwace2rxg&amp;bvm=bv.147448319,d.bgg ) song ( perhaps with a few changes ) over our anthem . 
  correct haha . 
  our highest ever temperature was 35,6 in 1970, 
  yeah a few times . 
  no cool stories to share really , as i do n't mind 40 + temperatures unless i 'm in a car without ac . 
  i sms to family and messenger to friends . 
  absolutely not . 
  202 , soon 203 years old .

  may 2016 as far as i know . 
  `` smurf , du skylder meg en cola '' ( smurf , you owe me a coke ) not sure why we say ` smurf ' or even what it means though ... 
  i think it 's more about american filmmakers making english movies and therefore reaching a larger audience . 
  there 's a fair amount of movies made in local languages , but they of course do n't go viral and the producers make less money so it 's often times not worth it . 
  does that mean our generations are getting taller and taller or that old people ca n't stand straight so they lose a few cm ? 
  baseball , basketball and handegg all seems quite dull imo , but ice hockey is alright - if that 's even american ? 
  reminds me more of canada actually . 
  absolutely . 
  i do n't see why they should have a get out of jail free card every time , but europe is happy being americas puppet for now it seems even if that makes us a bunch of hypocrites . 
  buffon seems to know it !, 
  sings it with passion as well !, 
  as of 20th october 2011 you can no longer be punished for burning a flag in norway . 
  here too . 
  circumstantial evidence should n't be enough to get someone convicted imo . 
  provide hard proof or let the guy go . 
  of course i would . 
  castles are awesome !, 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cedobluvbli ) that i can think of . 
  there 's a little english in some parts , but it 's mostly albanian . 
  not really , even though i travel a lot around europe ... 
  but i barely even feel norwegian , so it might just be me . 
  no one knows what a sophomore is mate . 
  i 'm actually thinking about relocating these days but i ca n't decide where i want to move . 
  probably a small town/city with a lot of sun and near the ocean . 
  i 'm not sure what the criteria is for a building to be called a skyscraper but [ these two ] ( http://img.gfx.no/1856/1856657/1200016542_19221.280x187.jpg ) are oslo 's tallest buildings . 
  the brown building is 112m and the silver building ( hotel ) is 117m . 
  [ picture from different angle ] ( https://imbo.vgc.no/users/vgno/images/5eb5141b2f4bc60d3c889d5376d20a9c?t%5b%5d=crop%3awidth%3d4450%2cheight%3d3002%2cx%3d0%2cy%3d285&amp;t%5b%5d=maxsize%3awidth%3d654&amp;publickey=drpublish&amp;accesstoken=ca921d2b3ca7cd480a3a254e68b4783739c37616101ee15e9b91d60d4814ab2b ) . 
  so it 's not very common here , but it is n't really needed anywhere but in oslo and possibly in 2-3 other cities . 
  hopefully we will build a few more in the coming years . 
   oh shit , kids on my lawn !, 
  brb , getting a shotgun !, 
  i just experienced having milk coming out my nose thanks to you, 
  apparently i fly the national flag carrier . 
  had never heard of this national flag carrier thing until now though , i just prefer sas ( scandinavian airlines ) over say norwegian . 
  norwegian obviously , most speak english and quite a few have studied one other language since 8th grade , usually spanish , german or french . 
  a lot of people forget even the basics of that third language a few years after leaving school though , unless they use it regularly . 
  the ural mountains in russia and the black sea is what i consider the border, 
  i prefer debit card , but cash is a solid number two . 
  makedonia or republikken makedonia, 
  do you know why they chose $ 550 ? 
  and the 2 000 people involved , what exactly do they have to do for the duration of this experiment ? 
  is ( islamic state ) . 
  i do n't notice much difference from country to country to be honest , only restaurant to restaurant . 
  oslo fire up fireworks for everyone to watch , but a lot of people buy a few themselves . 
  we 're allowed to use them from 18:00 today to some time tomorrow i think .
