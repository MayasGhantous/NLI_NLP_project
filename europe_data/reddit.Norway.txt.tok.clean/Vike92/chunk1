it 's not . 
  most people just does n't know what it means . 
  high hrothgar is from skyrim . 
  but yeah , looks like you would find [ dunharrow ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8ago8nb.jpg ) at the end of that path . 
  [ relevant map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/world_map_of_civilian_gun_ownership_-_2nd_color_scheme.svg ) it does seem that we have a desent amount of guns in northern and central europe . 
  op 's relationship with guns seems to be the common one in poland . 
  here in norway you can find hunting rifles in any big sport/wilderness shops . 
  oh it 's only a third of muslims that are radical , i guess that 's ok then ... 
  the migrant crisis has only just begun . 
  it can , but it wo n't , sinse so many are already starving . 
  do you really think hunger wo n't be an issue when there will be 4 billion people in africa ? 
  more people will die in the mediterranean . 
  when stories like these spread it will make every refugee want to go to germany . 
  and possibly more people will try to cross the mediterranean . 
  sorry for being cynical but i think it 's realistic . 
  [ ehem . . ] ( http://www.olympic.it/english/medal/id_winter.htm ), 
  then no . 
  you do n't think it 's even problematic that a big portion of muslims do n't support things like free speech and freedom of religion ? 
  these are the cornerstones of western civilisation . 
  but what meaning ? 
  well there 's seem to be clash between a sizable portion of muslims religious belief and western democratic values . 
  poll of british muslims : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/6309983.stm  36 % of 16 to 24-year-olds believe if a muslim converts to another religion they should be punished by death , compared with 19 % of over-55s, 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  do you consider the opinion of muslims being harder to integrate unwarranted ? 
  do you consider this a hate thread ? 
  finally someone makes this point . 
  we have no right to mock sweden for staying neutral during ww2 . 
  does it really ? 
  is this the general opinion on the nordic languages ? 
  have you considered that the one religion which have isis on their side is not he one true religion ? 
  why do you think god or allah made isis in his own religion and not others ? 
  it 's the windmill of friendship , silly !, 
  / r/eurovision for live discussion and such, 
  as a norwegian i 'm offended . 
  a chart we do n't top ? 
  what is this ? 
  i dont believe that . 
  cant an average person even name all the balkan countries ? 
  yeah i guess i 'm being overly pedantic . 
  now look at what you said earlier . 
  buddhists are tecnically atheists , mate . 
  yeah i have watched some debates and trump seems to be the only one that do n't want to fight assad 's regime in syria ( a russian ally ) , but only wants to focus on isis . 
  or `` would prefer trump to lead the states over hillary '' to be even more pedantic . 
  wait , they like saudi arabia more than the eu ? 
  in russia there is no time for jokes , only serving putin . 
  i for one , welcome our new russian overlords . 
  nothing explains politics like dank pepes . 
  until you see any signs . 
  really ? 
  that would be embarrassing . 
  i 'm on my phone now so i ca n't see it . 
  i 've never seen a map of europe not including the russian caucasus . 
  there cant be much of a dispute , surely ? 
  troll it is . 
  good day . 
  this has to be troll . . 
  yes , please . 
  send her to me in northern norway . 
  that thing is just . . 
  majestic . 
  you have to be as north as svalbard for it to be night for 4 months straight . 
  i can not fathom why you still would be able to be a muslim after shit like this happen . 
  there are 100s of religions in the world and you stick to the one with maniacs on your `` side '' . 
  maybe if there was a god he woudnt make a book that can be interpritted in this way . 
  i think we have the origin of trolls . 
  and no , not the internet kind . 
  well obviously . 
  i 'm suprised we are beaten by ireland and spain . 
  this is crossing the line . 
  they 're *, 
  can you show me racist comments on / r/europe that are not downvoted ? 
  i remember when hillary attacked him on this position during one of the debates he actually denied having said that global warming was a chinese hoax . 
  so maybe theres a chance that even he realize how ridicilous that is . 
  we can only hope . 
  i believe they will be proud again after world war 3 . 
  [ here 's one . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cz9foky.png ) legend is road fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants per year . 
  [ from here . ], 
  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/31pt33/road_fatalities_per_100000_inhabitants_per_year/ ), 
   lol, 
  estonia , to be considered a nordic country you need at least 150 metal bands for every million people . 
  so welcome , greece , i guess . 
  best sweden, 
  the new voting system added so much . 
  loved it . 
  how was it terrible ? 
  oh i believe they do , mostly . 
  i think it just gave ukraine the boost they needed to beat australia . 
  people vote politically with their phones as well . . just look at all the people in this thread already that thinks it 's hilarious that ukraine beat russia . 
  with that being said , i think russia 's song was n't very good either . 
  how can this system possibly be any worse than the previous one ? 
  you know that the juries still had their say previously , right ? 
  this just made the differences public and kept it exciting until the very end . 
  i only see positives . 
  this is amazing . 
  i really hope eurovision 2016 deliver with its memes . 
  the only thing i can come up with lately is the polish women churning butter . 
  if it were n't for eurovison i would have moved to canada a long time ago . 
  i must say some of those are hard to guess . 
  are there flags hidden on everyone ?
