  yes , but mostly as crew . 
  my family has a 38 ' sailboat , and i participated in 3 regattas last summer, 
  by norwegian standards :p, 
  i think it could work , even though it would face the obstacles of not being really known as good restaurant food . 
  maybe a steakhouse could do well here , but there is a lot of competition in that segment . 
  or did you think of something more unique ? 
  i trust them , but our former government had a lot of corruption that never resulted in much, 
  like tgif or hard rock caf\u00e9 ? 
  tgif does pretty well in bergen atleast , but both restaurant chains get slaughtered by food critics . 
  or did you mean something else than the big chains ? 
  our constitution was not written by your king .

  you went back on your promise to help denmark against the german confederation in the second schleswig war though , effectively ending the pan-scandinavism movement at the time . 
  it would have been interesting to get a peek into an alternate timeline and see how that could have ended up, 
  classic norwegian fairytales , donald duck , but the ones i remember the most are the german stories by hoffmann , and some by todays standard racist danish children books, 
  many times a week , but i still get kind of surprised when i see women in niqab . 
  some friends of mine actually made a hidden camera video as a school project when we were 14 , where they dressed in niqab and bought vodka in a state run liquor store . 
  the age limit for liquor is 20 in norway , and they always ask for id if you look younger than 30 or something, 
  cyprus , corsica , and greece, 
  i think it was a misunderstanding or something . 
  they said i was welcome to have dinner with them , but they never said when , so maybe they expected me to choose the time and date . 
  i did n't want to be rude and just show up :p, 
  i lived in an apartment over refugees from iraq 3 years ago . 
  one day , the son knocked on the door and asked me if i could come downstairs and help his father with some stuff . 
  it turned out to be that he needed help with his application to the university in stavanger . 
  he was an engineer that had worked in the oil industry in iraq , and wanted to get into the offshore sector in the norwegian oil industry , but the strict requirements here meant that he would have to study again . 
  they offered me tea , some sweet stuff and invited me for dinner . 
  i still regret not `` accepting '' the dinner invitation . 
  august , 2010 . 
  i have been to estonia after that , and never get any shit . 
  i 'm white though , and i avoid drunkards wanting to fight at clubs, 
  we call it vorspiel and nachspiel, 
  some of my friends experienced racism in poland , estonia and lithuania , but then again , it also happened once in copenhagen on the way home from a club at night . 
  edit : i have been called everything from jew to nazi in southern england , been cut with a bottle , thrown rocks at , and been threatened with a knife and bat . 
  shitty people are everywhere , and they mostly come out at night when they are drunk . 
  that being said , i do n't really think you 'll have any problems, 
  many places in europe , there are self-segregated gypsy communities . 
  they keep to themselves , stop their children from attending school , and wo n't get jobs .

  in norway i think h\u00f8yskoler and universities would be the equivalent of us colleges . 
  iceland . 
  if more than one : iceland , denmark , sweden , faroe , finland , \u00c5land , greenland and give us back the orkneys .

  i 'm having a really hard time thinking of any other streets that can be recognized as foreign if we discount scandinavia, 
  karl johans gate , is a famous street in oslo .

  corrupt tourist industry , many involvert in the tourism business refusing/hesitant to accept card instead of cash . 
  lovely and charming , even the ones trying to scam me . 
  i love the fact that i 'm rarely dragged into shops compared to when i 'm in turkey . 
  love the country , but with their use of cash and no/lacking reciepts in the tourism industry , it will be hard to efficiently run the country .

  there has always been debates in norway on how we can avoid pissing off russia , while at the same time protect our oceans and borders edit : as you can read from the article , the norwegian prime minister denies the claim from medvedev about a new cold war, 
  you got it wrong . 
  a strong currency means that you get more for your money from other countries and makes imports cheaper , while a weak currency means that you can export more , as your goods are cheaper in other countries, 
  people suck at using the turn signals, 
  good thing written dutch and norwegian is like 80 % the same edit : i 've mistaken dutchmen for south norwegians so many times on vacation, 
  is it me , or is there no english option when buying train tickets at schiphol from the automats,
