i was trying to get a strikethrough in the title as he claims norway but the man visits sweden and denmark . 
  fta :  it also warns that the us is `` no longer perceived to be the ` land of the free ''' and is placed 21st for the personal freedom , below countries such as uruguay and costa rica . 
  shit !, 
  i should tag him as `` dumb swedish mumitroll '' !, 
  michele bachman is from minnesota and you ca n't find anybody more crazy than that woman and she is in the congress !, 
  nope - this crazy ass stae is the one who has been electing [ michelle bachman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michele_bachmann ) . 
  if you do not know much about her , see [ rachel maddow : best of michele bachmann fails ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chlofa4hfjm ), 
  if you act like the average american abroad , you may have problems anywhere outside the us . 
  remember you are in a foreign country as a visitor . 
  when in rome do as the romans ... 
  actually , the help is a bit overrated . 
  there is a dramatized documentary based upon soviet documents from the time called `` stalin - behind closed doors '' . 
  it gives a bit of a different impression based upon the soviets own documents . 
  yes , the soviets got a lot of equipment but not what they needed the most and not what they often asked for . 
   you do n't think the soviets left norway because the allies said `` hands off ? 
  actually , that was not how it happened . 
  i ca n't find it now , but i had a link showing the events . 
  the soviet withdrawal from finnmark is one of the things that has baffled me the most . 
  look at the geography , had i been stalin at the time , i would have continued down norway and occupied it . 
  this would 've given the soviets an ice free atlantic base rather than murmansk . 
  they would 've gotten many fjords they could hide ships and submarines in . 
  the soviets actually withdrew inside the soviet union without any real pressure from the rest of the allies . 
  the only country this happened in . 
   fuck me , i do n't even have a danish flair , why would you care about my circumcision ? 
  because uneducated morons like you are the ones who continue this disgusting mutilation scam and it needs to be fought wherever it rears its ugly head !, 
  if you are wallowing in middle eastern iron age mythologies that require you to mutilate your kids , those mythologies are shit and should be ignored !, 
  grow up !, 
  hahaha - love your aus-flair - confuses the hell out of geography challenged americans !,

  fta :  `` the europeans are scared because there are a lot of u.s. companies that are making great cheese , '' said jeff schwager , president of sartori cheese . 
  what a moron !, 
   i was n't trying to be an asshole i agree !, 
  you do not have to try being something that comes 100 % natural to you !, 
  usa 1950 's : the great commie scare usa 2010 's : the great muslim scare rinse and repeat !, 
  and here comes an american talking about `` lefties '' . 
  do you even know what that means ? 
  who are these `` lefties '' you are talking about ? 
  there are none in us politics , that 's for sure . 
  [ neoliberalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neoliberalism ) is very well defined and i can understand your anger against it stems from being smack dab in the middle of it and do not like the connotations . 
  and just from your two posts above , i get the impression you do n't give a flying fuck about anyone but yourself . 
  you do not even have the intellectual honesty to review the facts and certainly not to critically and honestly review your own stance . 
  i 'm watching `` live from the ryder cup '' on the golf channel right now here in the us and the mood is not great among the us program hosts . 
  it was hyped up so much before and i think most americans thought this was going to be us year in ryder cup but no !, 
  go europe !, 
  * to the bald eagles , i say we pray no prey for you at gleneagles !, 
  strikes ? 
  lol - the amazon leadership had to look up the word in a dictionary as such things do not happen in the us !, 
  i 'm happy to hear this , about time workers stand up for the rights and lives and not let the corporations abuse them as they see fit . 
   so icelanders probably breed carefully and meticulously . 
  i guess that is why icelandic girls working as nurses etc in norway , always went all in and partied like there was no tomorrow !, 
  i 've spent a more than a few nights at various nurses homes in and around oslo over the years . 
  many moons ago while i was living in switzerland , i happened to watch , in one night , the series dallas with jr who normally spoke with a texan accent , speak in german , french and italian on three different channels !, 
  it was the weirdest thing i 've ever seen/heard !, 
  an american telling a portuguese how their portuguese language is used - / r/shitamericanssay, 
  see [ wardrobe malfunction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wardrobe_malfunction ) and [ super bowl xxxviii halftime show controversy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/super_bowl_xxxviii_halftime_show_controversy ), 
   however do remember the tens of thousands of americans that died there alongside you . 
  the first us combat troops on european soil , landed in italy on september 3rd 1943 , 4 years and 2 days after wwii started . 
  and for your dead , see [ battle of stalingrad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_stalingrad ) . 
  i 'm no big fan of the current russian leadership - they are pure garbage . 
   it 's also easier and cheaper to start a company in the uk than in most of europe . 
  i know this a bit on the side but there may be other places that are even better for startups , see the article with a shitty title : [ in norway , start-ups say ja to socialism ] ( http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110201/in-norway-start-ups-say-ja-to-socialism.html ) :  norway is also full of entrepreneurs like wiggo dalmo . 
  rates of start-up creation here are among the highest in the developed world , and norway has more entrepreneurs per capita than the united states , according to the latest report by the global entrepreneurship monitor , a boston-based research consortium . 
  a 2010 study released by the u.s. small business administration reported a similar result : although america remains near the top of the world in terms of entrepreneurial aspirations -- that is , the percentage of people who want to start new things -- in terms of actual start-up activity , our country has fallen behind not just norway but also canada , denmark , and switzerland . 
  i think you may have your data a bit wrong here . 
  cute !, 
  you think this has anything to do with st. louis and ferguson and is not a symptom of a much larger problem in the us ? 
  why is the world surprised ?

  lol - yeah but we suck in summer sports !, 
  edit : you know it is bad when we , as a nation , still remembers the bronze medal team winner in football in the summer olympics in 1936 !, 
  if you search for `` bronselaget '' ( the bromze team ) , the wikipedia page about the team is the first hit , [ bronselaget ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronselaget ) edit 2 : fun fact : hitler only watched one football match ever , between germany and norway in the olympics and the germans lost 2-0 !, 
  we are # 21 !, 
  yeah - suck on our silver medal !, 
  ok , i 'll see myself out now ... 
  this was hilarious and spot on , thanks for posting it .
