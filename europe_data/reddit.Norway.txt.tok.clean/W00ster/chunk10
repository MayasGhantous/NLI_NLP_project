  are you sure you will not have to take the service after the studies ? 
  that was the case when i did my service , i debated to wait until after university but decided against it and did my service before i started studying . 
  and here is the google translated english version : [ drop in church membership ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2feroakirkosta.fi%2fstatic%2fek-tilastot%2f ), 
  or maybe it is because us portions are at least 2 to 3 times the size we are used to and americans eat it all !, 
  breakfast is the most important meal of the day , it is supposed to get you going , eating liquid fat and sugar along with a healthy helping of cholesterol is not a great breakfast !, 
  you need food you body can function on and not just empty calories . 
  for that , you really need a scandinavian breakfast !, 
  this i many years ago , i was 16 and in paris on interrail back in the 70 's . 
  i was sitting at an outdoor cafe with a coffee and reading le figaro and there was this american couple sitting at the next table talking , not directly complaining , not extremely loud but with a level more than loud enough for me to hear . 
  it was n't specifically about parisians and frenchmen , it was about everything here was crap and nothing like at home . 
  i can tell you they looked puzzled when i lowered my newspaper and suggested they should have stayed home if nothing else compares . 
  the woman did * not * like my comments . 
  she said something about me being something something french upon which i corrected her and stated i was norwegian after which she became more uneasy as she understood a young snot like me spoke both english and french in addition to my native tongue . 
  the waiters liked me and i got some freebees !, 
  i never had any problems in france , even though my french was horrible and more often than not , i had no problems conversing with people in english as i had done an effort in french first . 
  nope , i 'm 1.96 and dark blond ... 
  one word , never travel to asia , i 'm 6 ' 6 '' and there were people staring at me all over the place , not to mention laughing . 
  one thing though - easy to see where you are going , never lost in the crowd !, 
  so ... what are we supposed to say now ? 
  omlg ? 
  that was not a trip i would wanted to have been part of !, 
  i got exhausted just from reading the story !, 
  i have never understood the pack mentality and traveling in groups . 
  i have always wanted to see and do what i want , not what some other have decided i should see !, 
  but then again , my first european roundtrip was at the ripe old age of 15 with a friend on interrail . 
  the 2 of us spent a month traversing continental europe on trains , the next year , i traveled alone !, 
  yepp , at 16 i traveled for a month around europe on trains alone . 
  yepp , great stuff !,

  candidate obama said before elections in 2008 :  `` this election is not about me , it is about you ! '', 
  i did n't really get it until recently since he left out 2 words !, 
  it should have said :  `` this election is not about me , it is about ** spying on ** you ! '', 
  obama just turned out to be another horrid us president in a long row of other horrid us presidents !, 
   i was speaking to one of my friends not too long ago about the cia and south america . 
  he had no idea . 
  see the worst 9/11 in history , the [ 1973 chilean coup d'\u00e9tat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_chilean_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat ), 
  the problem is that the norwegian politicians are way too buddy-buddy with the us . 
  they have been so since wwii . 
  all the way from [ jens christian hauge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jens_christian_hauge ) via [ per \u00d8yvind heradstveit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/per_%c3%98yvind_heradstveit ) , reporter in norwegian broadcasting and various `` secret '' organizations to [ thorvald stoltenberg ] ( http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/thorvald_stoltenberg ) and his son , now the prime minister , [ jens stoltenberg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jens_stoltenberg ) goes long line oif intimate cooperation with us intelligence . 
  norway would hand him over like a hot potato !, 
  jens christian hauge is also heavily responsible for israel having nukes today !, 
  the way this normally is done , is for the local embassy to issue a temporary diplomatic passport in the applicants name and then have him travel to the country in question .

   that picture was supposed to be satire , you will not find it posted in any government buildings . 
  yes , i am fully aware of that !, 
  but the picture does a great job of presenting a lot of american attitudes in a single image . 
  that is what art is all about . 
  it is not an exact depiction , it is a cauldron of ideas rolled into one single image . 
  terrorists ... lolololollo roflcopter !, 
  you created them and you are creating new terrorists every day in numerous locations around the world . 
  you are simply just a useful idiot to the us government .

  it starts at birth !, 
  in the us , you are from birth indoctrinated into the idea that the us is `` the greatest country on earth '' . 
  it is [ `` god 's own country '' ] ( http://jonmcnaughton.com/content/zoomdetailpages/onenationundergod_files/one_nation_under_god_002.jpg ) . 
  in an american 's mind , the us is superior to every one else on this planet and they think that all 7 + billion is having wet dreams each night about coming to the us , `` the land of milk and honey '' . 
  the honestly believe that the us is the `` shining city on the hill '' and the savior of the world . 
  they firmly believe that without the us , the world would end . 
  each day , school starts with a recital of the [ pledge of allegiance '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pledge_of_allegiance ) :  i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america , and to the republic for which it stands , one nation under god , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . 
  american soldiers are worshiped as heroes , if you get injured while in the military , you are given a medal . 
  on tv , you can see recruitment commercials like these : [ army ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glzdzqsvbj4 ) [ navy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvvuozw9diw ) [ air force ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2azxivvg1je ) if you really want an insight into the mind of those signing up , watch the documentary series , [ carrier ] ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=els4bos1wew-s ) , that is if you have the stomach to endure hours of idiots talking about how great the navy is and how little they understand of everything around them and how poor they were before they were tricked into signing on the dotted line in some backwater hell hole of the us . 
  in order to understand what is going on now , you have to understand the mind of the american and how it is colored by indoctrination from birth !,

  thankfully , i have not used a single ms product since windows 95 so personally , i do n't really care what they do !, 
  so , why use it at all ? 
  besides , you have no idea what the cost of bitcoins are in two weeks . 
  it is a yo-yo currency !, 
  well , i lived through the period and remember it well . 
  i 'm not going to bore people with political news from the time but let [ spitting image give you some samples ] ( http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=spitting+image+reagan+thatcher ), 
  and what the heck does this have to do with poland again ? 
  the first ` axis of evil ' was between reagan and thatcher , 2 satanic zombies , hated by the world !, 
  nope !, 
  here is the problem , i 'll use simple numbers so it is easier to understand . 
  let 's assume there are 100 bitcoins in circulation . 
  these sell for $ 200 per bitcoin . 
  however , mining bitcoin 101 will not cost $ 200 but let 's say $ 400 in power and computer cost . 
  in order for this to be interesting to do , the price of bitcoins must surpass the cost of mining the next bitcoin , else one will lose $ 200 on the mining alone . 
  so , the general price of a coin will have to surpass $ 400 for it to be interesting to mine the new coin . 
  how do you increase the cost of a coin ? 
  2 ways : 1 . 
  introduce an artificial scarcity 2 . 
  increase the demand for the coin . 
  now , let 's say the price of a coin , through a combination of 1 . and 2. , has ended up at $ 450 . 
  now mining the new coin will bring a profit of $ 50 and the coin is mined . 
  now the cost of a bitcoin is $ 450 but mining bitcoin 102 will cost $ 550 , hence it will result in losing $ 100 just from the mining alone . 
  price must increase in order for the next coin to be mined . 
  if you came in early in the ponzi scheme , you paid cents for a bitcoin . 
  these people have horded the coin and can easily change the amount in circulation for normal trade and create scarcity . 
  you , coming in on the top , paying a high price , is directly sending you money to the ones who got the coin cheap . 
  it is a pyramid scheme , just a new form and you are all falling for it !,
