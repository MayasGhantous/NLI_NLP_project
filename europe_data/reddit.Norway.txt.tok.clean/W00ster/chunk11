  it is that simple !, 
  bitcoins are finite in amount and mining new bitcoins becomes increasingly more complex and costly . 
  those who got in on the bitcoin scheme early on , got the coins real cheap and those who come in now , pay through the nose . 
  it is a classic ponzi scheme , digital age !, 
  it 's a digital ponzi scheme - avoid at all cost !,

  [ irn-bru ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irn-bru#norway ) :  norway  irn-bru entered the norwegian market in may 2008 . 
  they had to withdraw from the market again in 2009 as a result of problems with production agreements and lack of funding for proper marketing efforts , and irn-bru can not be bought in norway as of february 2010 . 
   they were believed to be sponsoring the adeccoligaclub mj\u00f8ndalen if in 2009 . 
  this later turned out to be fraud carried out by a third party company , and mj\u00f8ndalen if never received any sponsorship from irn-bru , even though the team played the 2009 season with irn-bru marketing on their shirt,

  and which is why i love eurovision - you never know what kind of insanity will surface during each years competition !, 
  this year , montenegro made the top of my list !, 
  i laughed hysterically through the whole performance . 
  the romanian homo erotic `` vampire on a pedestal '' was also brilliant !, 
  and uk 's bonnie taylor ? 
  must have been hanging out with the greeks for some free alcohol !, 
  and my own country ? 
  must be the biggest laugh in eurovision history , not this year but overall !, 
  we have more 0 point and wtf entries than any other nation and i am ~ ~ proud ~ ~ laughing !, 
  there were a lot of national directions of music but it would require you to know a bit more about the countries and it is often very subtle . 
  alexander rybak with [ fairytale ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbffll58utm ) - winner of esc in 2009, 
  usa have always had this inferiority complex toward europe and it often results in overinflating numbers to look good compared to europe . 
  not the same . 
  those are competitions built on a completely different premise . 
  a better comparison would have been if the us had a competition with participants from each state . 
  and here i am , finding myself singing along and liking the gutting of fish !, 
  hey !, 
  hey !, 
  it 's `` knugen '' !,

  posted about this in / r/eurovision last night , [ `` do n't complain , it 's even more expensive in norway !, 
  '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1ecyl8/dont_complain_its_even_more_expensive_in_norway/ ), 
   how do people in norway afford to get drunk ? 
  [ this way !, 
  the * only * way !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moonshine ), 
  as one who has worked in the us now for close to 20 years and make a decent income , most software engineers do not make that much . 
  a lot more than the average american for sure , but nothing stellar . 
  living in florida is cheap , the cost comes first if you get sick or lose you job , unemployment benefits are a joke here , same goes for social services compared to what one is used to in norway . 
  if you are young , starting a family - for heavens sake , stay put !, 
  it is light years better to form a new family and raise kids in scandinavia than in the us . 
  then when the kids have left home , move and enjoy the climate . 
  best way is to get knowledge , experience and expertise that is needed , find a job in a multinational us company in scandinavia and seek an intra-company transfer . 
  in soviet-norway , moonshine drinks you !, 
  norway 's alcohol prices are the direct result of puritan protestant teetotalers and their grip on this policy remains . 
  the result ? 
  moonshine everywhere !, 
  i 've been to parties out in rural areas where the priest , the police chief , the mayor and other `` important '' people was drunk as skunks on moonshine . 
  heck - my brother produced moonshine in his kitchen for years !, 
  so , it is not surprising that where i come from , [ karsk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karsk ) is the most common drink !, 
  and your evidence for this is ? 
   i 'm not sure how convincing your argument is when you 've just shown that the average student in your country gets roughly the average wage of an eastern european worker flawed argument !, 
  the cost of living in denmark i much much higher than in the eastern european countries . 
  you can not compare the amounts directly but in lieu of the average income as a percentage . 
   trust to help learn and understand about the holocaust which we might not have been able to do if we 'd have needed to apply for visas , ect really ? 
  well , sorry to say this but i have traveled behind the old iron curtain and getting visa was a breeze . 
  amunium has a very valid point . 
  i have n't been to turkey in 20 years or so but when visiting the tourist areas on the southern coast , i got the impression of religion often playing the same cultural role as christianity does in norway . 
  yes , there were calls to prayers but in general , life continued uninterrupted during prayer time . 
  and alcohol was cheap , real cheap :-) if the rest of turkey has evolved to be more or less the same , it is a great progress and surely the numbers seems to indicate you are moving in a good direction . 
  turkey - keep up the good work , but do n't forget , kurds are humans too !, 
   r/europe , which country do you feel your country is most culturally similar to : the united states , brazil , or russia ? 
  none of them really .
