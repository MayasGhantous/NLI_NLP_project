  the us has a great influence in pop-culture . 
  since we are unbeaten in football against brazil , that is not a good choice either . 
  well , i 'm 1/8th russian so in many ways , russian perhaps even though that influence stems back over a hundred year , before the revolution . 
  we are more influenced by the surrounding countries than some far away country . 
   biggest news might be that it snowed in parts of the country ... wow - has never happened before !, 
  amazing !, 
  but it would have been news had it snowed where i am now , florida . 
  it 's been a shitty week though , cold and rainy . 
  cold as in below 20 degrees and we had some rain storms that were tornado producing , florida is one of the most active tornado states . 
  her death took way too long to happen !, 
  been waiting on that cruel bitch-witch to go horizontal since the 80 's !, 
  have a lapin kulta for me , will ya ? 
  yeah , turks in the north and greeks in the south . 
  i have n't been to cyprus since the 80 's but yeah , there was a lot of tension between the two parts of the island . 
  south is richer also due to tourism , which is strange in some ways as turkey has a lot of tourism and the south of turkey is a very beautiful area well worth visiting . 
  ikea - but they are difficult to assemble !, 
  or maybe it 's due to more honest reporting also ? 
  that is always a step toward better times , acknowledging the problem and then trying to do something about it . 
  it 's been a long time since i visited romania , it was during the cold war and it was a big shock in many ways coming from hungary to romania even during those days . 
  the difference between the countries behind the curtain were great , romania was one of those who suffered the worst but still , as a country , romania has a lot to offer , esp in the area of tourism and should be able to , with a decent government , to lift itself out of poverty over time . 
  well . . 
  lets be honest . 
  romanians have not exactly had an easy life in the 20th century under ceau\u0219escu and the soviets so i am not surprised it takes time to change . 
  it will change for romania , i 'm sure about that given time . 
   we should be looking for 1gbps in all the major areas by that time if we 're to compete in the emerging high bandwidth economy . 
  meanwhile here in the good ole ' us of a , i ca n't get anything better where i live than 40mbs . 
  one company offers faster speeds but it is impossible to figure out where i can get it . 
  i am in the process of moving and wanted to move to place where i could get faster speeds but in order to tell me if i can get it , i need to know the address . 
  well , i do n't know the address , i just want to know where they have coverage but the company can not tell me this so i have to sit and manually enter hundreds of addresses in order to try to find where their service is . 
  genius !, 
  i am with you all the way to the last statement , there we split . 
  i just do n't care for music in general so i do n't buy or pirate it !, 
  i do n't own any music , neither pirated nor legally bought . 
  that is less than the average speed the space station moves with !, 
  from [ international space station ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_space_station ) :  average speed  7,706.6 m/s ( 27,743.8 km/h , 17,239.2 mph ), 
   `` schatkist '' in norwegian : skattekiste . 
  yeah , a lot of germanic languages have the same word for taxes and darling . 
  i 'm sure it is a trick in order to make us more positive toward paying taxes !, 
  so , why are coca cola and other industries doing well in countries taxing them heavily already ? 
  i hope the catalans told the ambassador to fizz off !, 
  fuck this shite - i am so fucking tired of the us strong arming countries for their stupid companies . 
  fuck coca cola and the ambassador with a broken fanta bottle !, 
  the * only * coke-type product i can drink , is diet pepsi , bot regular coke and pepsi is so sweet i cringe when i drink it . 
  and covered in corn syrup , the staple of american cooking , high fructose corn syrup . 
  it looks even better in an [ hd video !,

  `` do i need a brain ? 
  fuck no ! '', 
  - marcbot, 
  i have seen top gear , i know they have a lot of supercars !, 
  i have no bad feelings nor prejudice against romania . 
  i know it is still struggling to find it 's feet after the years under ceausescu but that is to be expected . 
  it has a long way to go in transforming from an agrarian society to a modern 21st century country , things take time !, 
  radasse !, 
  radasse !, 
  my kingdom for a radasse !, 
  not me !, 
  bunga bunga parties seems something i could be down with !, 
  that is just weired , freaky weired and sounds so fake . 
  as a norwegian , i am not used to dubbing , we use subtitles . 
  back in the 80 's , i was living and working in switzerland and one night , i managed to watch `` dallas '' in three different languages , kind of funny to hear the texan j. r. ewing speak german , french and italian , just not right if you ask me !, 
  please explain how that result in working fewer hours !, 
  i knew it !, 
  cheese makers have to be the biggest goat and donkey fuckers !, 
  if you make any form of brown sauce for food , drop a few slices of brunost into it and let it melt away and enrich your sauce !, 
  brunost is not so bad , it worse when people snort [ `` fucked cheese '' ] ( http://www.sfj.no/cms/sjh/mm.nsf/lupgraphics/pultost4_md.jpg/$file/pultost4_md.jpg ) !, 
  [ pultost or `` fucked cheese '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pultost ) - the word `` pult '' can mean two things really , `` fucked '' and `` desk '' , but i like `` fucked cheese '' better . 
  go away !,

  senor , you are my new best friend !, 
  if it was one thing i hated when i was in school , it was nynorsk or new-norwegian . 
  an artificial , stilted and completely unnatural language . 
  well , snowboard in norwegian is `` sn\u00f8brett '' ;-), 
  i would say dutch is more like norwegian . 
  i had quite an easy time learning it , many norwegians , especially speed skaters because they often compete against dutch , pick up dutch easily and the same for dutch learning norwegian . 
   and danish is a very confusing language for me . 
  yes , it is even [ confusing to the danes themselves ... ;-) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
   i.e that tear gas canisters started the fire there are several types used by lapd , some set off a small pyrotechnic charge , some do n't . 
  the one used here do and should never be used in environment where fire is possible , e.g. 
  indoors . 
  the [ los angeles police department ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/los_angeles_police_department ) has a long and illustrious history of corruption and violence . 
  remember [ rodney king ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rodney_king ) ? 
  us police normally get around a 10-12 week training course before they become officers . 
  cases like [ this one is all too common !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=comwrdbndhs ), 
  maybe they need to be starved to get rid of the crazy system ? 
  well , i had taxi drivers in london refusing to take me where i wanted to go because it was too far away !, 
  in every form where race is an option , hispanic is a separate choice . 
  luckily baltimore ravens became ** world champions ** in american armpitoval last night !, 
  great job , iceland !, 
  if american fbi idiots think they can travel anywhere in the world , act like it is their country and act as police everywhere , it 's time to start arresting them at arrival and charging them with espionage . 
  about time the world starts standing up to the idiots in israel !, 
  this is nonsense . 
  europe needs two eu 's - one for the northern countries and one for the southern countries . 
  putting all of them in one big cauldron , is a recipe for disaster . 
  what did you people expect ? 
  it 's italian for crying out loud !, 
  looks great but falls apart when used !, 
  i got mine for free in the military ( or next to free , think the actual cost was around 10 euros ) . 
  ok , the maldives it is then !,
