   i do understand we have to be moderate and rational and not generalise the behaviour of a minority to an entire group of people , once this groups starts to deal with their own extremists and shut down this behavior , i will be happy to !, 
  cheers !, 
  i really hope that goes without saying !, 
  that was not bragging - that was a statement of facts !, 
  [ i guess this one belongs here ?

  `` where is the ` any key ' ? '', 
  way to go champ !, 
  you just demonstrated your own ignorance about the world !, 
  as a norwegian social democrat i am not interested in getting rid of our monarchy . 
  even though one of the royal family is batshit crazy and is into [ angels and other new age bullshit !,

  german house wife pop !, 
  ranked slightly worse than the swedish equivalent !, 
  or were you people looking for * good * things from germany ? 
   `` the cemeteries are full of indispensable men . '', 
  whoever said this initially should have received free drinks until his death !, 
  lol !, 
  i see we have to go back to 1620 to find one ... not bad !, 
  dear rich frenchies !, 
  shut the fuck up and just move !, 
  you will not be missed !, 
  sincerely , not a rich person !, 
   anyway , i would drink with depardieu . 
  let me ask you this : as a norwegian , i 'm used to consuming rather large amounts of alcohol but are there anyone a russian would ** not ** drink with ? 
  or pee in the lap of your neighbor who is sleeping !, 
  `` his reputation '' is being a humongous douchenozzle of a gasbag !, 
  no , why should you , i agree with hesthest . 
  nationalism this way , is a good thing !, 
  i love res - tagged as `` dumb troll '' in red so next time i remember !, 
  well ... 
  since i currently am living in the us , i hear a lot about aruba . 
  first and foremost , it 's a popular vacation destination with american high school kids just finished with the school as in aruba you can legally drink at the age of 18 while in the us , you have to wait until you are 21 . 
  and all of this brings us to the [ natalee holloway ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natalee_holloway ) case which involved aruba and some dutch aruban boys . 
  then of course , aruba with it 's many casinos are also the home of the [ ultimatebet aruba poker classic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_poker_tour_season_4_results#ultimatebet_aruba_poker_classic ) on the world poker tour which is sent on us tv . 
   i just think that there is too much unjustified hate towards the pope and the catholic church . 
  alas , it is not unjustified at all , i guess it may look that way to those who do not know the background stories . 
  rcc is not exactly a force for good in this world and the pope is the chief thug . 
  most heterosexual guys i know do not spend a second thinking about gay sex , if they think about sex in any way , it is with women !, 
  yeah , but i can tell you the kids are butthurt !, 
  sure , i have . 
  see : [ pope benedict ( ratzinger ) involved in child rape cover-up ] ( http://liberatedmind.com/2010/03/pope-benedict-ratzinger-involved-in-child-rape-cover-up/ ) [ pope benedict stalled child molestation case , 1985 letter shows ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/09/pope-benedict-stalled-chi_n_532073.html ) and not to mention [ pope says child rape is n't that bad -- was normal back in his day ] ( http://birthofanewearth.blogspot.com/2011/11/pope-says-child-rape-isnt-that-bad-was.html ) fta :  '' ... victims of clerical sex abuse have reacted furiously to pope benedict 's claim yesterday that paedophilia was n't considered an `` absolute evil '' as recently as the 1970s . 
   `` in the 1970s , paedophilia was theorised as something fully in conformity with man and even with children , '' the pope said . 
  yeah , your pope is one heck of a dude !, 
  i guess this is really the right time to post this : [ why do all these homosexuals keep sucking my cock ? 
  ] ( http://www.theonion.com/articles/why-do-all-these-homosexuals-keep-sucking-my-cock,11150/ ), 
  but dear pope-a-dope !, 
  [ which of the many biblical marriages do you support ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofkekkszxtw ), 
  good - have him come back in 2016 and then we may care . 
  [ gro harlem brundtland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gro_harlem_brundtland ) maybe ? 
   that 's not what free speech is about . 
  really ? 
  fcc is not a government institution ? 
  fcc have not regulated what you can or can not say or show in us media ? 
  the fcc did n't fine for the `` wardrobe malfunction '' ? 
  me thinks you have no understanding of what `` free speech '' means . 
  it does not mean the authorities can censor speech or make laws to censor speech , even if said speech , by some , is considered indecent , whatever that is . 
   in europe nope , not `` in europe '' , maybe in some countries . 
  that would be like saying `` in montana '' versus saying `` in usa '' . 
  there certainly are no such laws where i come from . 
  good luck - happy to have voted against joining eu in the last referendum !, 
  `` landsfader '' ( father of the nation ) [ einar gerhardsen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/einar_gerhardsen ) - a former road worker and prisoner for his political work, 
  always !, 
  roma often have problems because they are criminals . 
  affairs are still a big deal for most , parents do care what their kids do but kids get more and more legal rights as they get older . 
  one does not wait until 21 and poof !, 
  europeans ( in general , as you say , this differs from country to country ) are way more relaxed toward things that makes people go ape-shit bananas in the us . 
  remember the `` wardrobe malfunction '' during superbowl some years ago ? 
  europeans laughed at americans reactions to a 1 second tit . 
  i grew up on topless and naturist beaches all over europe and i am 55 . 
  and to me , `` free speech '' does not include censorship like we see in the us , bleeping of words and blurring of images are not free speech but censored speech . 
  norway 86 %, 
  well , you danes pissed all over us for 500 years so ... 
  oil and gas only account for 20 % according to the study . 
  well , as a norwegian living in the us but went to the university of oslo , i have never seen any such usage while i studied . 
  there is , however , a humongous problem here in florida among other places . 
  we have what is called [ `` pill mills '' ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/us/01drugs.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ) . 
  these are clinics that do only one thing , write prescriptions on all kind of restricted pharmaceuticals . 
  all you have to do , is show up , pay for the `` consultation '' and walk away with a prescription of your favorite drug . 
  but this is a problem that is so damn easy to fix if there are any politicians with some balls made out of anything but foam !, 
  are you telling me that muslims do n't follow 7th century practices ? 
  of course , they are not in a position in germany to demand that you follow their laws ... yet . 
  but you can take your girl friend on a sunny vacation to saudi arabia and when you are there , go to a beach and have youtr gf sunbath topless . 
  what then happens , will give you an indication as to whether islam has moved into the 21st century or are still stuck in the 7th !, 
  it 's a time machine that would take europe back to the 7th century !, 
  nonsense !, 
  this has nothing to do with `` islamophobia '' but with religious people killing others for failing to abide by their interpretation of said religion . 
  there have been plenty of examples of christian fundamentalist parents killing their kids through refusal to see a doctor but relying on prayers and they have all been discussed on reddit . 
  are you calling us `` christophobes '' too ? 
  well , that may have something to do with alcohol prices in norway leading to many homes having [ one of these ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/pontikkakattila.jpg/220px-pontikkakattila.jpg ) and that leads to a lot of drinking . 
  my brother had one of these and we constantly were testing the product the norwegian way : - 1 empty coffee cup - 1 cube of sugar - hot coffee - moonshine put cube of sugar into the empty coffee cup , pour coffee until cube disappears , pour moonshine until it reappears , mix and drink !, 
  now you are simply not giving yourself enough credit , my friend !, 
  as most norwegians , i love denmark , flat ? 
  sure , but charmingly flat with beautiful little towns and some damn good food and drink !, 
  what is there not to love about denmark ? 
   the biggest sporting event for him is sweden/finland in ice-hockey !, 
  yeah , that 's war !, 
  much like in the old days between the soviets and the czechoslovakian teams !, 
  loved those grunt matches !,
