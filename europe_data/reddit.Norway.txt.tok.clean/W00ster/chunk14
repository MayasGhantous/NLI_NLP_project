  not deep frying everything and snickers and their granddads usually helps a lot !, 
  the italian kitchen is not very fatty besides the noodles . 
  as someone who has lived and worked in switzerland i can tell you are nothing but a dumb racist and has been tagged as such for future references . 
  have a ~ ~ nice ~ ~ day , ~ ~ sir ~ ~ !,

  my friends here in the us call it kentucky fried shit ... 
  i wish but i am not , go to any store such as walmart and you 'll find 4xl , 5xl , 6xl etc and yes , the americans really need those sizes , they really do !, 
  yepp , that is an american . 
  i live in the orlando area in central florida and here there are competitions about who has the best decorated property and people drive to the areas which year after year have the most insane displays to view !, 
  you can send in pictures and tips to the local tv station and they feature one christmas decorated house each day until christmas . 
  it looks so cheap and yucky and tacky and some even put out loudspeakers to play christmas music to the ~ ~ enjoyment ~ ~ annoyance of the neighbors !, 
  edit : [ this is the local news 13 tv stations website with their daily holiday home ] ( http://www.cfnews13.com/content/news/cfnews13/on-the-town/holidays/holiday-homes.html ) here is a really [ goudy and tacky home ] ( http://www.cfnews13.com/content/dam/news/images/2012/11/hh-pratt-family.jpg ), 
  how fat are you ? 
  serious question as you may have problems finding clothes to buy if you are a big american . 
  us sizes are also different . 
  us small is european medium , us medium is european large , us large is european x-large , us x-large and xxl , xxxl , xxxxl , xxxxxl and xxxxxxl in european size ?? 
  do n't think they exist . 
  `` hjemmebrent '' for the win !,

  ask me !, 
  i even have a picture of this strange [ thing called `` the sun '' ] ( http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/realtime/hmi_igr/512/latest.jpg ), 
  there are both norwegian brie and camemberts on the market . 
  jarlsberg is in my opinion the best cheese you can buy but then again in my not so humble opinion , that is ... 
  yepp , svinesund will look like a huge meat market once again !, 
  what 's wrong with responsible whaling ? 
  have you ever eaten whale beef with onions ? 
  it 's damn yummy and tasty !, 
   `` so i had two solutions : give up my salary , and go to germany or sweden or norway . '' no , you could 've gone to any other islamic country and seek refugee there . 
  remind me again in which european country are the means of production owned by the state ? 
  in the us they would just be dumped on the street and told to fend for themselves , no help , no language training , no nothing . 
  i got to see this one !, 
  this is the most swedish thing i have seen in a long time . 
  `` tre kronor '' was just perfect !, 
   what exactly was so crazy about our response ? 
  what was not crazy ? 
  invading two wrong countries ? 
  that was my first thought when i saw the shit go down live on tv . 
  and we will never hear the end of it and millions of peoples lives have been impacted by the american wild west response . 
  mieto and many other great finnish skiers !, 
  for me , the best non-norwegian cross country skier would be [ vladimir smirnov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_smirnov_ ( skier ) - amazing guy !, 
  norway has one olympic medal per 11,000 citizens , the us has 1 medal per 119,000 citizens . 
  we are ten times better than you !, 
  `` hytte '' in norwegian is normally translated with `` cottage '' . 
  you can also see that on wikipedia , go to https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/hytte then look at the english link in the sidebar and you will see `` cottage '', 
  mehhh . . no chance these days ... we 'll just buy sweden and denmark and problem solved !, 
  i was born in trondheim , norway and in my dialect : \u00c6 e i a \u00e6 \u00e5 !, 
  means : i am a member of the labour party too !, 
  can you please give us .2 so we also can be ahead ? 
  no , they do not . 
  they may be good against earth quakes but not much else . 
  here in florida , when a mild storm blows by , houses are hit hard due to shitty building codes . 
  do n't even think about a hurricane - i happened to live in a decently constructed house 10 years ago during charley , frances and ivan , three large hurricanes whos path met right above my head . 
  our house was fine , lost a couple of shingles off the roof , neighbor house had tens of thousands in damage as it was a regular shitty built house . 
  us building standards are crap . 
  it 's such cheap and shitty buildings not built to last but to be cheap and offer as much space as possible . 
  and they are incredibly energy inefficient !, 
   there is a little bit of negligence about the soviet contribution a little ? 
  `` back to back world war champs '' t-shirts seems to indicate otherwise . 
   d-day is seen as the major turning point in europe the turning point in europe was the battle of stalingrad . 
  ca n't be polish !, 
  too few ` z '' s and not enough squiggly lines above the letters !, 
  norwegian : jeg new norwegian : eg, 
   you spanish whores !, 
  you spanish iores !, 
  we 've said that for a long time now ... 
  i guess this is the result of the right wing coalition government and the extremist left wing `` kvinnefronten '' ( women 's front ) . 
  they both have extremely puritan views !, 
  so ... no female police huh ? 
  well , la-di-da !, 
  find every female police officer in the area and post only women to the force protecting the king . 
  if he has a problem , he can go bye-bye !, 
  the north-south divide is extremely obvious for all to see . 
  this is what is going to break eu . 
  an old school friend was doing medical research on , among other illnesses , the 1918 spanish fever outbreak and had been digging up corpses on svalbard as they had been frozen and had tissue preserved . 
  he also took random control samples from people and asked me if i wanted a dna analysis done . 
  hence i got this information . 
  should 've known this 30 years ago ... 
  well , i am immune to hiv/aids . 
  i am one of those with the [ ccr5-\u039432 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ccr5#ccr5-.ce.9432 ) mutation . 
  that 's because nobody understands a sober dane , when you are drunk , your speech is actually understandable , just like norwegian !, 
   i 'm having a hard time sympathizing . 
  ekki taka feel better now ? 
  yeah , my french grammar is horrible these days , i can read it just well and understand it but when it comes to writing it ? 
  not practised for many years !, 
  happy bastille day , ~ ~ mon ~ ~ mes amis !, 
  ( `` it took them only an instant to cut off this head , and one hundred years might not suffice to reproduce its like . '' ), 
  the swedes have something to say about this : [ waterloo ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsvemz1f5c ), 
  nah , have n't been to the bahamas for over a decade , i live in florida btw . 
  brits are easily spotted on vacation resorts along the med - they are pink and drunk !, 
  not all of them ;-) [ my summer view here in florida ... ] ( https://500px.com/photo/114265043/the-look-of-summer-in-florida-by-b-wooster?from=user_library ), 
  [ poll : what is your favourite us mass shooting so far this year ? 
  ] ( http://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2015/06/19/poll-what-is-your-favourite-american-shooting-so-far-this-year/ ), 
  this ( not specifically to greece but to european southern nations in general ) was among the reasons why norway twice voted no to join eu . 
  the differences in economics are simply to big and would cause issues . 
  we were right in 1972 and in 1994 . 
  not hindsight but people simply refusing to accept the evidence before your eyes . 
  now i am just reminded of eurovision 2013 and greece 's entry - [ alcohol is free !,

  portuguese sardines - grilled !,
