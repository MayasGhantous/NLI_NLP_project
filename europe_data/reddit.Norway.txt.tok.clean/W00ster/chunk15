  ok , isis - now you have done it !, 
  you just pissed off putin !, 
  [ this is how he will come after you !, 
  ] ( http://watchmen-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/putin-rides-a-bear-610x400.jpg ) take cover !, 
  left home at 18 , could n't wait to get out !, 
  first to a year in the military , then to the capital for studies at the university . 
  never looked back !, 
  i was given the following tongue twister when learning dutch : ** `` achtentachtig praktische kacheltjes in en kanaal in scheveningen '' **, 
  not so much difficult as scary , we send them to [ hell !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hell,_norway ), 
  i 'm sorry but i can not tolerate that !, 
  sigh ... 
  he was talking about the ones deported , not all refugees . 
  and yes , people like you are the problem , your reading comprehension and reality views are fucked up !, 
  bbc just started a brilliant series on napoleon , see [ napoleon 2015 episode 01 | bbc documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gps9ejcnbes ), 
  the most cringe worthy part of esc - all the local tv personalities wanting to have their 15 seconds of fame !, 
  so ... business as usual ? 
  well of course !, 
  the swedes are , by default , always the ones to blame !, 
   that they do discriminate based on life choices . 
  when those life choices affects the well being of the child , it is not discrimination . 
  then they are just following the law . 
  i do n't know anything about these cases so i will refrain from commenting on specifics but barnevernet has always been seen as someone many people think overreact but i am not always so sure , it is behaving the same way towards `` regular '' norwegians for lack of a better expression . 
  this may also be down to differences culturally in regards to child treatment , norway also has a [ children 's ombudsman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/children%27s_ombudsman#norway ) , norway was the first country in the world to create one back in 1981 . 
  so any such cases can be reported to the ombudsman who will investigate . 
  lol , when i was a teen , i was hunted by knife wielding members of the family of a roma girl i had been busy seducing - they wanted to kill me . 
  that was over 40 years ago and i am still alive !, 
  `` nuclear physicist '' - you should have asked her what she meant about that . 
  if she is a researcher , it depends on the filed of study , if she works for any of the nuclear reactor designers , it depends on how many new will be put in place . 
  i 'm not sure what to make out of that statement as it really says nothing . 
  it was a paella !, 
  the problem with being upset about this , is the fact there is no entry for `` jihadist '' on the application form and in case they satisfy the normal requirements fro assistance , they will get it . 
  i am also equally sure that the assistance was stopped once the conditions became evident . 
  that is one racist piece of shit link !, 
  yeah , i am not sure there is case for blaming sweden here unless it is under the normal `` everything wrong is the fault of sweden '' umbrella !, 
  ahhh well ... sweden has a lot of experience with soviet subs . 
  do people remember [ u137 or soviet submarine s-363 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_submarine_s-363 ) which ran ashore , just outside sweden 's largest naval base ? 
  [ u137 - whiskey on the rocks ( only swedish ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtbikhvuasw ), 
  willy brandt - my favorite german politician , he even spoke fluent norwegian !, 
  i am not surprised the us wants tougher action , they want that with everything , from kids to guns to enemies to prisoners . 
  it is a cultural phenomena not seen elsewhere . 
  all i 'm going to say , is [ `` kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 '' !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  funny - i already had you tagged as `` complete idiot '' so you must have made an impression previously too !, 
  seems deserved !, 
   so do people without children get to take time time off , too ? 
  yes , it is a strange concept most americans are unfamiliar with - it is called `` paid vacation '' . 
  you should look it up on wikipedia . 
  see [ bbc documentary 2015 - caribbean with simon reeve episode 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=caribbean+simon+reeve ) where simon is in venezuela and crosses the border to colombia along with tons of petrol smugglers . 
  well , you 'd have to be inside the ring area when the beam is active but there is already so much radiation there so you 'd die from that rather than the proton beam . 
  difficult weapon to bring with you on an expedition but ... 
  religious people !, 
  sigh . . all the crap you do for your middle eastern iron age mythology . 
  we need to get a room !, 
  well , these are results from searches in english and not in norwegian . 
  completely different when you use norwegian so i am not sure it is representative . 
  when i go to google.no and type the norwegian equivalent : `` hvorfor er estonia '' , it gets nothing . 
  if i do '' hvorfor er tyskland '' ( why is germany ... ) i get `` why is germany such a rich country '' these charts needs to be made based upon what is searched for in the local language . 
  the dutch are our brothers in arms when it comes to speed skating - i hate you some times and i love you other times . 
  damn you are good skaters !, 
  fkl 982 ... 
  it 's 8pm here in florida and it is currently 24 , had around 30 today , it was really nice , not a cloud with a nice breeze . 
  wrong title - correct title should be `` knowledge of the german language in eu '', 
  party hardcore !, 
  `` we lost to sweden in skiing - the end is near ! '', 
  - finns love drinking - alcohol expensive in finland - esti cheap - finn drunk - drunk finn becomes depressed finn - [ ends life !, 
  europe is not a country ... maybe if you were a bit more specific you might be able to get any answers . 
   how about not intentionally targeting muslims with offensive material ( to muslims depictions of their prophets are forbidden ) how about muslims learn that non-muslims do n't give a flying fuck what muslims think about the cartoons ? 
  and that muslims ca n't force their religious rules on the whole fucking world ? 
  never stop making mohhamad cartoons - never !, 
  not sure , could not understand the words as they were sung upside down !, 
  historically the world did n't give a shit about jews either . 
  but today , the israeli fascist regime needs to be overthrown and these crazy ass mf ` ers needs to recede into obscurity . 
  some times i wonder if the world would 've been better off without the jews . 
  and the other half is busy having gay sex !, 
   wan na get some nationalism ? 
  [ sure !,

  i prefer [ shredders ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn80eaikqjs ) myself but hey !, 
   there are many freedoms and sources of funding for companies , so your business will flourish . 
  well , the problem is that entrepreneurship in the us is falling behind and for obvious reasons as it is easier to try and fail in more civilized countries . 
  [ in norway , start-ups say ja to socialism ] ( http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110201/in-norway-start-ups-say-ja-to-socialism.html ) :  in 1998 , dalmo quit his job , bought a used pickup truck , and started calling on clients as an independent contractor . 
  by year 's end , he had six employees , all mechanics , and he was making more money than he ever had . 
  within three years , his new company , momek , was booking more than $ 1 million a year in revenue and quickly expanding into new lines of business . 
  he built a machine shop and began manufacturing parts for oil rigs , and he started bidding on and winning contracts to staff oil drilling sites and mines throughout the country . 
  he kept hiring , kept bidding , and when he looked around a decade later , he had a $ 44 million company with 150 employees . 
  and  this is exactly the kind of pride i often hear from the ceos i have met while working at inc. , but for one important difference : whereas most entrepreneurs in dalmo 's position develop a retching distaste for paying taxes , dalmo does n't mind them much . 
  `` the tax system is good -- it 's fair , '' he tells me . 
  `` what we 're doing when we are paying taxes is buying a product . 
  so the question is n't how you pay for the product ; it 's the quality of the product . '', 
  dalmo likes the government 's services , and he believes that he is paying a fair price . 
  and  norway is also full of entrepreneurs like wiggo dalmo . 
  rates of start-up creation here are among the highest in the developed world , and norway has more entrepreneurs per capita than the united states , according to the latest report by the global entrepreneurship monitor , a boston-based research consortium . 
  a 2010 study released by the u.s. small business administration reported a similar result : although america remains near the top of the world in terms of entrepreneurial aspirations -- that is , the percentage of people who want to start new things -- in terms of actual start-up activity , our country has fallen behind not just norway but also canada , denmark , and switzerland . 
  it is easier to start a company , if you fail , you have a welfare network to catch you so you can try again . 
  well , these idiots call hitler and the nazis left wingers so you know you are dealing with the intelligentsia !, 
   4 ) excellent firearms and firearms culture spoken like a true american !, 
  so insecure without his gun !,
