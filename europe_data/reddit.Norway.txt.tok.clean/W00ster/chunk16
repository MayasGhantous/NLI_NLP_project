  norway !!!, 
  no , wait !, 
  what am i saying ? 
  not norway !, 
  swedes are great !, 
  they do all the low paying jobs !, 
  500 years of that was enough , me thinks . 
  you just want our oil and gas and piggybank !, 
  a philandering flander flanderizing dutchies !, 
  see [ the joys of being a woman in norway ] ( http://afroginthefjord.com/2014/01/05/the-joys-of-being-a-woman-in-norway/ ) :  `` this year my colleague did something really bitchy to us : she got pregnant '' says the guy sitting across the dinner table in my french new year 's eve 2014 . 
  i almost choked on my slice of camembert . 
  i 've been living in norway for 4 years and never have i ever heard such negative comments associated with pregnancy . 
  `` she left for 3 months on maternity leave . 
  i mean seriously !, 
  and then you wonder why employers do n't want to hire women in their 30 's '' . 
  this did not seem to shock anyone around the dinner table , including a guy with his baby son in his arms and my 8-month pregnant friend . 
   norway benefited from well managed oil profit redistribution of wealth . 
  i 'm sorry but that is wrong and if you want to know why it is wrong , see [ avoiding the oil curse : the case of norway | institute of politics / harvard - talk by the former norwegian pm and current nato secretary general , jens stoltenberg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f6geivdwpk ), 
  and when someone summoned do not show up , what happens then ? 
  will an arrest order be issued so they will be arrested if they ever leave their current country of residence ? 
  all news is local news , you idiot !, 
  [ the norwegian labor party 's logo ] ( http://apps.o5.no.s3.amazonaws.com/dna/org/level1_1/level2_1_4/level3_1_4_439/main_site/20150302165930-990-ir4m/1000.jpg ), 
  not european countries but eu countries - there is a difference . 
  no , probably from finnish-ugric . 
  in norwegian it is called `` iskube '' ` kube ' = ` cube ', 
  it is not like guns are rare in norway , there has been a national shooting competition held every year since the 1880 's !, 
  see [ landsskytterstevnet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5ddo1v-lms ), 
   there may be a select group of americans who think that way . . see / r/conservative or better , / r/shitrconservativesays and you find the attitude there all the time !, 
  you did n't have any classes in gammel norsk ? 
  ( old norwegian ) . 
  it is pretty easy to understand most icelandic with a background in it . 
  which is about aligned with the democratic party in the us !, 
  norway has nothing as extreme right wing and fascistic as gop !, 
  and [ here it is !, 
   \u00d6resund bridge \u00d6resund brunell ? 
  [ you think ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qgk1etb-38 ), 
  my cousin was [ ms. universe from hell !, 
  really ? 
  can you tell me what income sa has that could possibly replace the oil incomes ? 
  they really do not have much to show other than oil , which means not just austerity but a complete crash . 
  by making their oil income so tiny that they can not finance the country based upon the oil income alone and with no ability to loan money , bankruptcy is not far fetched !, 
  was n't is some saudi guy who said : `` my granddad drove a camel . 
  my dad drove a mercedes . 
  i drive an aston martin . 
  my son will drive a camel ! '', 
  so ... poland is trying to steal our oil and gas now ? 
  damn !, 
  i hope the norwegian government invites him and take him to visit [ frogner park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frogner_park#vigeland_installation_.e2.80.93_the_sculptures_in_frogner_park ) - the sculpture park is nothing but naked sculptures , the most famous being [ sinnataggen or angry baby ] ( http://m9.i.pbase.com/v3/62/235762/2/45822329.angry_baby.jpg ), 
  [ this is the only area i am nationalistic in !,

  i 'll give you badass !, 
  the most badass norwegian on youtube , is apetor , and he says [ `` merry christmas '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfu-vfrjrhu ) to you , belated !, 
  great video , just one thing ... you flew on red light !,

  did not know about them - thank you !, 
   during the aids crises and other turmoil , americans created both the rainbow flag and the first gay pride parade yet it took until 2015 for gay marriage to be federalized . 
  lol , ok ... of course you had to drag the us into this even if it had nothing to do with them !, 
  both denmark and norway have had gay interest organizations long before that time , see [ national association for lesbians , gays , bisexuals and transgender people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_association_for_lesbians,_gays,_bisexuals_and_transgender_people ) - created in 1948 . 
  cock fight !, 
  in the long run , yes . 
  but you can not say that last winter and this winter is a result of global climate change . 
  ask any climate scientist you want . 
  weather and climate is not the same . 
  last winter was exceptionally cold and snowy here in the us , this year not so much . 
  just like last year was not an argument against claims of global climate change , this winter is no different . 
  freakish weather exists since weather is chaotic while climate is not !, 
  so , what they are saying is that they should have gone to saudi-arabia and not sweden then . 
   personnel having personal contact with customers not everyone in retail have such contact . 
  plenty of retail workers are never having any contact with customers . 
   the swedish-norweigan rivarly is mostly based on historical hate today that rivalry is settled in the ski tracks and with jokes . 
   in what way is it far reaching ? 
  maybe the expansion to ireland and scotland is going to far but the actual nordics uniting is not far off . 
  i have no problems with scotland and ireland , i have a problem with becoming a federal united country . 
  if anything , a nordic union should be modeled more or less on eu . 
  it would be a lot more successful than eu , based on cultures a lot more aligned , with somewhat similar economic and political backgrounds . 
  i 'm not a fan of the idea you are proposing , it is too far reaching . 
  but i hear from americans all over reddit that it is us , the non-americans who always beg the us for help . 
  kim jung erdogan ? 
  really ? 
  as a norwegian i am sure you have heard the expression `` polsk riksdag '' or [ polish parliament ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_parliament_ ( expression ), 
   hamsun [ `` sult '' ( hunger ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hunger_ ( hamsun_novel ) was his great epos !, 
  you are angry at the hand that feeds you ? 
  [ arnfinn nesset ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arnfinn_nesset ) :  arnfinn nesset ( born october 25 , 1936 ) is a norwegian former nurse , nursing home manager and convicted serial killer . 
  his crimes include the murders of at least 22 people , as well as attempted murder , document forgery and embezzlement . 
  he may have murdered up to 138 people . 
  in 1983 he was convicted of poisoning 22 patients and sentenced to 21 years in prison . 
  he served 12 years and 10 years supervision , and is thought to be living under an assumed name . 
   following her remarks , saudi arabia withdrew its ambassador to sweden . 
  it also stopped issuing visas to swedish businessmen . 
  the united arab emirates joined it . 
  the organisation of islamic co-operation , which represents 56 muslim-majority states , issued a statement accusing sweden of failing to respect the world 's ` rich and varied ethical standards , ok then - when will the the organisation of islamic co-operation start ? 
  you can start by respecting the fact of topless sunbathing .
