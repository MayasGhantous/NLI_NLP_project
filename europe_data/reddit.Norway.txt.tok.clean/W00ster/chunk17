  when you allow western women to sunbathe topless on your beaches , you may have a point until then - fuck off !, 
  or something as simple as alcohol or respect atheists !, 
  i get what you are saying . 
  a lot of images are over worked in post processing , colors are way up in saturation , all kinds of filters are used to make them unnatural . 
  i try not to , i do what is called `` urban nature & wildlife '' photography .

  yepp , it 's a catch-all name used for all charter tourist destinations around the med and including the canaries . 
  `` syden tur '' - trip to the south ` syden ferie '' vacation in the south . 
  drunk norwegians or those wants to get drunk , fly to [ `` syden '' ] ( http://afroginthefjord.com/2014/05/30/hvor-i-helvete-er-syden/ ) !, 
   acting like other countries are bellow them and forced to abide by their idiotic world views . 
  if i , as a norwegian , moves to your country , i will have to follow your country 's laws and not norwegian laws - same here . 
  do n't like it ? 
  well , lad-di-da - fuck off !, 
  american coffee ? 
  lololololol that 's a troll article . 
  ** migrant ** - economic ** refugees ** - fleeing from generally unlivable conditions in their home country . 
  goal should always be to return them home when situation changes . 
  ** asylum seeker ** - persecuted individual , most often very interested in returning home when they are no longer persecuted . 
  i 'm not a motorcycle fan , far from it , i have stayed away from them my whole life but i have to say , this was a very cool looking bike !, 
  indeed !, 
  went to university of oslo and it has resulted in a very nice life for the past 32 years of working so i have no complaints !, 
   in your sarcasm do you really think that the middle east was peaceful prior to the invasion of in your understanding of the world , does it start in 2000 ? 
  does iran 1953 not count ? 
  does the creation of israel count as aggressive moves that started the strife ? 
  does the 6 day war not count ? 
  the large problems in the middle east started after wwii . 
  i spent a year as a ski teacher in saas-fe some 33 years ago - they still want snow from me !, 
  great job , americans , in electing president hitler !, 
  you all have at most four years left to live - make the best of the time you have left alive !, 
  the us does n't have what europeans think of when they say `` political parties '' !, 
  the us have political umbrella organizations . 
  neither d nor r goes to election on party programs , each candidate have their own crazy ass program so you end up with a congress that looks more like a [ `` polish parliament '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_parliament_ ( expression \\ ) ) where next to nothing can be done . 
  if you ask any us voter to name the top 5 issues that either d or r will work on in the next period , you will get no answer because no such thing exists . 
  there is no uniform politics behind the letters , each candidate is basically his or her own political party . 
  it is , by far , the single worst political and electoral system i have ever encountered !, 
  adding the green party and some libertarian to the mix is not an improvement but the opposite . 
  the us needs to throw out its outdated antiquated political and electoral system and introduce a new multi party parliamentary system . 
  this way , the current losers will have a voice and not be completely disenfranchised,

  that is a meaningless statement unless you quantify the deaths . 
  it may be down from 100 years ago but it is still order of magnitude greater than any european country thanks to the insane us second amendment .

  yes that is correct !,

  well , it is 17 years since i have seen them since i now live much further south than you do , florida , but if i remember correctly , it is a time of the year when some cold white fluffy stuff falls from the sky and when you pee on it and it is cold , it freezes and makes driving a bitch .

  norway is a communist country ? 
  wow - you should tell that to the coalition government between the conservative party and the libertarian party that has been in government since 2013 . 
  i 'm sure they will agree with you on that !, 
  and when it comes to women , see [ the joys of being a woman in norway ] ( https://afroginthefjord.com/2014/01/05/the-joys-of-being-a-woman-in-norway/ ) :  `` this year my colleague did something really bitchy to us : she got pregnant '' says the guy sitting across the dinner table in my french new year 's eve 2014 . 
  i almost choked on my slice of camembert . 
  i 've been living in norway for 4 years and never have i ever heard such negative comments associated with pregnancy . 
  `` she left for 3 months on maternity leave . 
  i mean seriously !, 
  and then you wonder why employers do n't want to hire women in their 30 's '' . 
  this did not seem to shock anyone around the dinner table , including a guy with his baby son in his arms and my 8-month pregnant friend . 
  and  before living in norway , and previously in denmark , i had never really realised how bad it is to be a woman outside of scandinavia . 
  of course i was experiencing sexism on a daily basis in france . 
  whether it was at work ( i had a student job in a bakery ) where my boss was making comments about how he had the same `` \u00e9clair au caf\u00e9 '' in his pants if i was ever interested in seeing it . 
  in the metro , where i had to make sure i was n't touching any man around because i had found myself several times with men taking an accidental light touch as an invitation to put their hand on my bum or even between my legs . 
  you can imagine how hard it is to figure out whose hand it was when you are in a parisian metro totally packed . 
  when going out at night , i had to re-think what to wear depending on whether i would walk home alone later that night . 
  then i could not wear a skirt or a dress , because i would then be `` asking for it '' . 
  i thought about all this on a daily basis without realising how much space it was taking , and that it does n't have to be this way . 
  and  no matter how much i love my country , i realise now i am not ready to leave the joys of being a woman in norway for any lower equality standard ( that probably means i can never move away from this country ) . 
  i want to continue seeing my male colleagues leave work early to pick up their kids , and hear only congratulations when a colleague is pregnant . 
  i am not really sure what happened here for vikings to become equality champions where men take months off to push their kids prams , but it all sounds good to me . 
  i respect all of those , women and men , who fought and continue to fight for gender equality in norway . 
  if you are n't sure how good this is , take a plane . 
  i can tell you you have come a long way and i am so glad to be part of it !, 
  you mean a black man in sweden ? 
  nobody but the us uses the `` african-nationality '' moniker because it is stupid !, 
  people from africa is white , black and anything in between !, 
  i have no idea what `` african_swede '' would mean beyond a person being born in an african country and then moving to sweden . 
  `` african-swede '' says nothing about skincolor . 
  lol - another american who has no clue what communism means and what europe is !,
