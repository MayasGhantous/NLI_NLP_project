  ca n't exactly say i 'm surprised when you have been brainwashed since birth with this nonsense . 
  in norwegian it can be `` b\u00e6sj '' ... slang for poop . 
  see / r/norwaypics, 
  lol , i looked at norway and it says akp . . akp has in norway been known as `` arbeidernes kommunist parti '' or the workers communist party but then i realized it was the turkish party names, 
  yes , china has started freight train routes to europe as it is some times cheaper and often faster to transport the goods over land rather than over sea . 
  see [ yuxinou railway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuxinou_railway ) :  yu'xin ` ou railway ( \u6e1d\u65b0\u6b27 ) is a freight rail route linking the southwestern chinese city of chongqing with duisburg , germany . 
  and  according to the european commission , as of march 2014 , the eu is china 's biggest trading partner . 
  and  most goods transported via this route are from multinational it companies in chongqing . 
  one of these is technological giant foxconn who supplies hewlett-packard , acer inc. and apple inc. and  from january to november , 2012 , a total of 40 freight trains ran on the yuxinou railway , transporting 1747 containers with 21,000 tons cargo , and worth of 1.15 billion usd . 
  the freight included 3.062 million laptops and 564,000 liquid crystal display screens . 
  [ 7 ] ** in 2012 , the train , `` roughly eight football fields [ 800 yards or meters ] long '' , ran weekly . 
  in early 2014 it runs three times weekly and , `` to accommodate a sevenfold increase volume since 2012 -- soon will go daily '' ** . 
  by 2020 trade with china could top that germany has with the netherlands and france , in 2014 the top two german trade partners . 
  if you really want to know how china is thinking and acting in the economic area , there is a very good documentary series about the topic , see [ one belt one road documentary episode one : common fate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntprkecciu ) . 
  the video quality is a bit iffy for the first episode but the rest are hd . 
  if you are only interested in the pure economics , watch episode five . 
   you have a very poor trade balance with china and if you open the markets to the chinese , it will be eu businesses and citizens that will suffer big time . 
  you have no idea what you are talking about !, 
  see my comment above about the one belt , one road policies . 
  according to the european commission , as of march 2014 , the eu is china 's biggest trading partner . 
  i would like to point people toward a chinese policy called [ `` one belt , one road '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/one_belt,_one_road ) - it is set to recreate the [ silk road ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silk_road ) in the form of an over land route and a maritime belt . 
  [ the trump family group photo !, 
   instead of the debate fully focusing on the issue of malmo and sweden 's issues , we are constantly being told `` it is n't as bad as chicago '' . 
  do you speak swedish ? 
  there is a lot of discussion going on in swedish , you know , the language of sweden !, 
  can be difficult if you do not speak a word swedish to keep up !, 
  see [ in the ghetto !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2en0zyjqgu4 ), 
   and in europe of course . 
  of course but that subreddit is still helpful when it comes to finding names . 
  and yes , since i currently live in florida , mine are local to me . 
  if you wonder what plant it is , you can always post it to / r/whatplantisthis i shoot a lot of flowers and have used them extensively to [ identify my flower images ] ( https://500px.com/w00ster ), 
   at the time it was n't that interesting !, 
  xd tell me about it !, 
  not my favorite topics at the time either . 
  but i got hooked on languages when i started learning german in eight grade . 
  yes , the - a ending is special . 
  i learned both riks and bok in school but no , i spoke pure trondheim dialect , actually within trondheim , a dialect from the rosenborg area . 
  yes , it is true that the current spoken language in the eastern parts of norway is not sounding like danish when spoken but is much more aligned with danish when written . 
  from the link i gave :  the latest writing reform of bokm\u00e5l , made official in 2005 , moved bokm\u00e5l back to its roots in riksm\u00e5l , in such a way that the two language forms are more or less the same . 
  currently , riksm\u00e5l or bokm\u00e5l in a moderate form is the preferred language for around 90 % of norwegians . 
  it 's the favorite vacation area inside norway for many . 
  we call it `` s\u00f8rlandet '' or `` southern land '' simply . 
  a lot of people from the oslo region have `` hytter '' ( vacation homes ) in the area and drive down for the weekend . 
  bokm\u00e5l came from [ riksm\u00e5l ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/riksm%c3%a5l ), 
  it depends on whether you have learned any [ old norwegian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_norwegian ) or not . 
  i find icelandic quite easy after having learned the differences . 
  of course , dating icelandic nurses at ullev\u00e5l hospital in oslo also helped !, 
  all i have to say , is [ kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  example : [ telenor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telenor ) it is currently ranked as the worlds [ 9th largest mobile phone operator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_mobile_network_operators ) , ahead of all the us ones for instance . 
  another one is [ norsk hydro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norsk_hydro ) :  norsk hydro asa ( often referred to as just hydro ) is a norwegian aluminium and renewable energy company , headquartered in oslo . 
  hydro is one of the largest aluminium companies worldwide . 
  it has operations in some 50 countries around the world and is active on all continents . 
  or [ statoil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statoil ) :  statoil asa , ( ose : stl ) , is a norwegian multinational oil and gas company headquartered in stavanger , norway . 
  it is a fully integrated petroleum company with operations in thirty-six countries . 
  by revenue , statoil is ranked by forbes magazine ( 2013 ) as the world 's eleventh largest oil and gas company and the twenty-sixth largest company , regardless of industry , by profit in the world . 
  [ 4 ] the company has about 23,000 employees . 
  yes and in particular in the northern rural areas which have led to those working there paying less in taxes and norwegians may get their student debt paid off by working there for instance . 
  and the lack of nurses all over the country is why i used to speak somewhat understandable icelandic since i used to date a lot of icelandic nurses in oslo !, 
  i have no idea what it is or what caused it . 
  i was just giving some possible origins for the radiation based upon what the russians have across the border from norway where the readings were first done . 
  really ? 
  i had no idea !, 
  shocking news , i 'm telling ya !, 
  but do you know what they are ? 
  very similar in everything !, 
  lol - you might enjoy this russian series with english commentary : [ the baltic fleet ( e01 ) : russian stealth corvette and ` black hole ' submarine get ready for a face-off ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhcgtc4kwdq ), 
  seeing it was first reported from the norwegian-russian border , it may come from [ novaya zemlya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novaya_zemlya ) where russians traditionally have tested weapons . 
  the [ tsar bomba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnye_uawz3u ) was set off there . 
  another possible source may be [ murmansk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murmansk ) , right across the border where the russians have their northern fleet bases , housing nuclear subs among other things . 
  because norway is a very expensive country with a small population spread out over a huge geographical area !, 
  the country actually covers three time zones but only use one . 
  [ in norway , start-ups say ja to socialism ] ( http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110201/in-norway-start-ups-say-ja-to-socialism.html ) :  in 1998 , dalmo quit his job , bought a used pickup truck , and started calling on clients as an independent contractor . 
  by year 's end , he had six employees , all mechanics , and he was making more money than he ever had . 
  within three years , his new company , momek , was booking more than $ 1 million a year in revenue and quickly expanding into new lines of business . 
  he built a machine shop and began manufacturing parts for oil rigs , and he started bidding on and winning contracts to staff oil drilling sites and mines throughout the country . 
  he kept hiring , kept bidding , and when he looked around a decade later , he had a $ 44 million company with 150 employees . 
  and  this is exactly the kind of pride i often hear from the ceos i have met while working at inc. , but for one important difference : whereas most entrepreneurs in dalmo 's position develop a retching distaste for paying taxes , dalmo does n't mind them much . 
  ** `` the tax system is good -- it 's fair , '' he tells me . 
  `` what we 're doing when we are paying taxes is buying a product . 
  so the question is n't how you pay for the product ; it 's the quality of the product . '', 
  dalmo likes the government 's services , and he believes that he is paying a fair price . 
  ** and  norway is also full of entrepreneurs like wiggo dalmo . 
  rates of start-up creation here are among the highest in the developed world , and norway has more entrepreneurs per capita than the united states , according to the latest report by the global entrepreneurship monitor , a boston-based research consortium . 
  ** a 2010 study released by the u.s. small business administration reported a similar result : although america remains near the top of the world in terms of entrepreneurial aspirations -- that is , the percentage of people who want to start new things -- in terms of actual start-up activity , our country has fallen behind not just norway but also canada , denmark , and switzerland . 
  ** the problem you have , is not knowing anything other than the fantasies you have been told !, 
  the us put man on the moon . 
  ratios are good , but not everything . 
  ahhhh !, 
  ladies and gents !, 
  her we can see an example of [ armstrong 's law ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=armstrong%27s%20law ) in action !, 
   armstrong 's law describes the phenomenon observed when discussions between americans and non americans about a variety of topics , where it become apparent america is not the greatest at said topic , the likelihood of the american to arbitrarily bring up the us moon landings as a non sequitur increases dramatically . 
  or with [ norway ... ] ( https://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/us/no ), 
   yes . 
  6 months in germany , 2 years total in europe as a whole . 
  in the military ? 
  if it was the military , it really does n't count . 
  you then lived in an american enclave !, 
   wow , i had no idea common law was such a minority .
