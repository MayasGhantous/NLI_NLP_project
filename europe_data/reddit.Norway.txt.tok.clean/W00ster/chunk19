  [ the joys of being a woman in norway ] ( https://afroginthefjord.com/2014/01/05/the-joys-of-being-a-woman-in-norway/ ) :  `` this year my colleague did something really bitchy to us : she got pregnant '' says the guy sitting across the dinner table in my french new year 's eve 2014 . 
  i almost choked on my slice of camembert . 
  i 've been living in norway for 4 years and never have i ever heard such negative comments associated with pregnancy . 
  `` she left for 3 months on maternity leave . 
  i mean seriously !, 
  and then you wonder why employers do n't want to hire women in their 30 's '' . 
  this did not seem to shock anyone around the dinner table , including a guy with his baby son in his arms and my 8-month pregnant friend . 
  and  before living in norway , and previously in denmark , i had never really realised how bad it is to be a woman outside of scandinavia . 
  of course i was experiencing sexism on a daily basis in france . 
  whether it was at work ( i had a student job in a bakery ) where my boss was making comments about how he had the same `` \u00e9clair au caf\u00e9 '' in his pants if i was ever interested in seeing it . 
  in the metro , where i had to make sure i was n't touching any man around because i had found myself several times with men taking an accidental light touch as an invitation to put their hand on my bum or even between my legs . 
  you can imagine how hard it is to figure out whose hand it was when you are in a parisian metro totally packed . 
  when going out at night , i had to re-think what to wear depending on whether i would walk home alone later that night . 
  then i could not wear a skirt or a dress , because i would then be `` asking for it '' . 
  i thought about all this on a daily basis without realising how much space it was taking , and that it does n't have to be this way . 
  and  no matter how much i love my country , i realise now i am not ready to leave the joys of being a woman in norway for any lower equality standard ( that probably means i can never move away from this country ) . 
  i want to continue seeing my male colleagues leave work early to pick up their kids , and hear only congratulations when a colleague is pregnant . 
  i am not really sure what happened here for vikings to become equality champions where men take months off to push their kids prams , but it all sounds good to me . 
  i respect all of those , women and men , who fought and continue to fight for gender equality in norway . 
  if you are n't sure how good this is , take a plane . 
  i can tell you you have come a long way and i am so glad to be part of it !, 
  oh , that 's the guy who did the same trip some four centuries later ?

  a few centuries ago , i spent three summers doing it . 
  you meet a lot of great people . 
  the first time , about 10 minutes after i left my hometown , i ended up in a compartment with two german guys and three swiss girls , eating cheese and bread and drinking wine . 
  some of my best vacations were these years on interrail !,

  who invoked article 5 of the nato treaty again ? 
  it is just so typical that in a thread that has nothing to do with the us whatsoever , a patriot has to wallow into the thread and interject the us into the thread . 
  it is as if americans can not read a thread that is not about the us due to severe insecurities . 
  i have to admit , i have n't been there in a very long time but it was a go-to destination whenever i was in copenhagen and that was a lot in the 80 's and 90 's .

  i 'm sure sweden is very much similar to norway in that respect . 
  plenty of hunters all over the country but you never really run into them on a day to day basis , equipped for hunting . 
  in norway , [ `` elgjakt / \u00e4lgjakt '' ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%84lgjakt ) is a tradition a lot of city dwelling norwegians get worked up over , don their hunting attire , clean their rifles and set off to the hunting areas , often with an ample supply of alcohol for a week away from wife and kids and out playing hunter with their buddies . 
  but norway is called norge so these are transliteration of the english version of the name , not the actual name of the country as used locally . 
   still , please allow others to decide for themselves how to call certain partnerships .
