  damn santa claus - keep a tab on your reindeers !, 
  btw , reindeer is delicious , my family in finnmark , norway had a lot of reindeer when i was a small kid and we always got a lot of reindeer meat after slaughter . 
  mmm ... reindeer tongue - best cold cut meat you can get !, 
  i just felt like drowning in bureaucracy some times but i guess you are right . 
  i do n't think that is much of a problem in norway either . 
  the problem is more cost than legality . 
  - beer - sauerkraut - cars ( norway 's only [ attempt was just trolling !, 
  ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/troll_%28automobile%29 ) - autobahn - legal prostitution - oktoberfest - sausages - football - efficiency but we have oil and gas ... 
   the source said to interfax : `` the case is about obligatory membership fees to fish sales organizations that russian businesses are not , or do not intend to be , members of . '' well , then . . what the fuck are you complaining about ? 
  sell your fish to mongolia then !, 
  but see ... and this is the problem ... people think that israel can not do anything bad after having suffered during wwii . 
  people forget that this suffering were for around 10 years while the palestinians have suffered for 67 years and with no end in sight . 
   we have way too many people confusing what the israeli government does with the local jews . 
  not really strange when the same people are 100 % in support of israel , they then becomes supporters of the hated politics and perfectly acceptable targets . 
   it 's not the fault of the local jews !, 
  if they support israel , they are just as guilty . 
   it 's not the fault even of all the israeli people !, 
  yes , it is - they elect their leaders just like any other so called democratic country and the citizens must take responsibility for what their leaders do . 
  if not them , then who ? 
   but then , the same happened with the muslims after 9/11 ... and for the same reasons . 
  some things are better in germany . 
  yes , i freely admit that . 
  may i suggest the best documentary on wwi i have ever seen , from 2003 : [ the first world war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zviwcutq5o&amp;list=plf99d52c080463c76 ), 
   at the time , it was very controversial , as it required a tax to be levied to pay for it everything in the us which requires taxes to pay for them , are controversial . 
  mostly because it seems to be a deep hatred toward taxes in the us . 
   ninja edit : does someone know bush gardens in florida ? 
  was amazing 15 years ago . 
  yes , live some miles away from it . 
  still great , gotten a lot more coaster than 15 years ago , well worth visiting again and when you do , also visit islands of adventure in orlando at universal studios and seaworld . 
  both got some really great coasters . 
  in bush gardens , i enjoyed being invited to the media day a long time ago when their new wooden coaster opened . 
  rode it all day long . 
  i am so sick and tired of the israeli/palestinian bullshit . 
  at 56 , they have been going at it all my life and they will not stop until they have the religious control over the areas they want on both sides , something that will never happen . 
  the creation of israel was the worlds biggest blunder after world war ii and we have been paying for this blunder for close to 70 years with no end in sight . 
  these people , on both sides , will not be happy until the other ones are dead . 
  the middle east is a goner . 
  he only drinks coffee with a lot of creamer in it ... 
  i 've not heard that one before . 
  enjoy !, 
   i 'm always surprised when the news finds a young religious person . 
  i would n't ever know where to find them . 
  i started the norwegian version of high school in 1973 - that was when i met my first religious person , a new classmate . 
  he was the only one in my class that was religious and we saw him as a bit of an oddity . 
  no hate for the us team , they have been doing just fine except for today where the team looked more [ like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/plastic_colander.jpg ) than a football team and had it not been for the giant tim howard , the result would 've been a lot worse . 
  that is good for the game in the us . 
  orlando where i live , is also supposed to get a new stadium for football ( soccer ) for [ orlando city soccer ] ( http://orlandocitysc.com/home/ ), 
  he is a world class goalie , one of the best performances i have seen in many years . 
  had it not been for the us goalie tim howard , the us would 've lost 13 - 0 !, 
  wow !, 
  i mean . . are you ... 
  i have no words ... 
  yes , get rid of the protection of sick fantasies . 
   but under what authority are you judging other peoples religious claims ? 
  personally , i call it a sick fantasy without evidence and as such , it should get no special protection . 
  so , the general experience is then that men in balaclavas set off bombs - hence , get rid of balaclava wearing men to reduce the chances of setting off bombs . 
  oh this is rich - an american telling us what to do !, 
  from a country where religious discrimination just was upheld by the supreme court . 
   the issue should n't be framed as us not respecting their cultural values , it should be framed as them not respecting our cultural values . 
  we have a winner !, 
  try to go to saudi arabia and if you are a woman , go topless on the beach like you do at home and see what happens when you claim cultural protection !, 
  we need to stop coddling these clowns . 
  great ruling !, 
  your cultural or religious ideas do not trump a country 's laws !, 
  want to be able to live fully according to your mythology ? 
  move to a country promoting it , not to one which do n't give a shite about you !, 
  and if you want something real amazing and which started the whole porn debacle , see the swedish , by todays standards , pretty tame movie [ `` jag \u00e4r nyfiken -- en film i gult or ' i am curious yellow !, 
  ' '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyjowssu5e4 ) also see the imdb entry : [ i am curious ( yellow ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061834/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ), 
  why ? 
  can you tell me what you imagine would happen if they left and why that would be bad ? 
  1300 years of strife is not solved by us military might ... 
  jesus himself spoke english with a texan accent !, 
  right !, 
  found a picture of him , [ here he is !, 
   tomorrow , everyone is a belgian except the russians ... ;-), 
  and now england is out !, 
  you can watch the whole trip on the sapsan from [ st. petersburg to moscow here !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wr9chfqzsw ), 
  kvinnefronten was an organization that started back in the 70 's and has always had an disproportional effect on norwegian politics . 
  its impact is still felt today and its activities has largely been taken over by [ kvinnegruppa ottar ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvinnegruppa_ottar ) . 
   the swedish and norwegian approach is the most stupid one out there . 
  it is incredibly stupid but it is , at least in norway , thanks to the [ kvinnefronten or womens front ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvinnefronten_%28organisasjon%29 ) - a norwegian marxist womans liberation organization full of crazy women with way too much political influence . 
  but you just did ... 
  human lives were cheap and plentiful in the soviet union during the war , equipment on the other hand not , so people were sent forward with little to no training and equipment and basically either learned to survive real quick or died . 
  the more people you can push forward , the more resources the enemy must use to stem the flood and when resources are scarce , it is a winning tactics , albeit a costly one in human lives . 
  be aware - that sub has just as much bad history as any other sub , if you want real history , see / r/askhistorians, 
   i do n't know , the russians probably could have made it to berlin with brute force . 
  but they did , see [ battle of berlin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_berlin )  the battle of berlin , designated the berlin strategic offensive operation by the soviet union , was the final major offensive of the european theatre of world war ii . 
  [ f ]  starting on 12 january 1945 , the red army breached the german front as a result of the vistula -- oder offensive and advanced westward as much as 40 kilometres ( 25 miles ) a day through east prussia , lower silesia , east pomerania , and upper silesia , temporarily halting on a line 60 km ( 37 mi ) east of berlin along the oder river . 
  [ 14 ] when the offensive resumed , two soviet fronts ( army groups ) attacked berlin from the east and south , while a third overran german forces positioned north of berlin . 
  the battle in berlin lasted from 20 april until the morning of 2 may . 
  yeah , you even dub porn !, 
  that i ind hilarious - thinking about those who do the dubbing , sitting in a room with a microphone , watching porn and laying over german sex talk . 
  the speak `` english in spanish '' . 
  the words may be english but they are pronounced like spanish words . 
  i had to sit through some work training last year with one who spoke english in spanish and one who spoke english in chinese . 
  it is quite tiresome when you have to concentrate for days . 
  they could not have been called anything more incorrect than `` friendlies '' !, 
  it 's all out war !, 
  [ my favorite ` friendly ' !,
