  let me add some fire to that : `` americans invented pizza according to them ! '', 
  and bunga-bunga parties ... 
  let me ask this in all seriousness : - after 65 years of war and unrest in the area and neither of the parties willing to give an inch . 
  do you really think peace is achievable ? 
  i personally have given up on the middle east , glad palestine was accepted but it will really change nothing . 
  there is a key player here and as long as this key player continue to support israel , the war and unrest will continue unabated . 
  the key player is of course the us . 
  nope ... [ gross national happiness ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gross_national_happiness ) and [ happiness economics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/happiness_economics ) covers that topic !, 
  i asked a cow and she said [ `` happy cows are from california !, 
  '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up880afv_qs ),

  in a pub , many moons ago , a gentleman took great care of laying out in great details all the reasons why this was not the case . 
  of course , it took a few pints ... 
  yeah but during july , august and september we can have 35c daily and with 100 % humidity . 
  that 's the time of the year i like to stay indoors as much as possible . 
  it is also prime time for thunder storms which causes us to loose power on a daily basis thanks to the antiquated us power system . 
  a huge battery supported ups is necessary for all computer equipment or else i will have a 10 hour raid rebuild on my storage system every day . 
  this is actually the best time of year , end of october until june , great weather and very little rain and little humidity . 
  the hurricane season ends this week too !, 
  all this talk about natural beauty makes it natural for me to post this brilliant little video of the [ hurtigruta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hurtigruten ) , the video compresses the 134 hour long boat trip through the midnight sun into only [ 37 minutes with some awesome music !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uxzknysqfm ) ( choose the 1080p for glorious imagery ! ), 
   we here at baltic like to think that we are not one of them . 
  you are not . 
  i see you three as part of the real nordic countries . 
  looked depressing !, 
  ouch !, 
  indeed and i can tell you as a climate refugee , the sun is shining here in florida but it is extremely cold here today , only 16c !, 
  today was the first day with a long sleeved shirt since february ... 
  the private prison industries in the us have been called modern day slavery . 
  they are not purdy , inmates are paid 2 cents/hour . 
  well , we have had cleaners at the office here in orlando , florida , who have been working here for years and still ca n't speak a word english !, 
  amazing to me , an immigrant . 
  the problem are often the immigrants themselves , they flock around each other and use their own language , watch native language tv and movies and have no communication with natives as they can not speak the language !, 
  they shop in their own stores and deal only with their own and never learn the language .

  general question : if i happened to be a rich bastard , like say some of the james bond villains and i had my private train , could i use it on railroads around europe ? 
  is that possible ? 
  do n't agree with israel ? 
  anti-semitic !, 
  oh grow the fuck up , this is retarded !, 
  for fucks sake - wwii ended in 1945 , we are writing 2012 , it 's about time germans are accepted for who they are today and i can see no wrong in germany criticizing israel ( or anyone else for that matter !, 
  as i said , i 'm an idiot , it should have been standalone , sorry .

  man , thanks for the laugh - still wiping tears here .

  i mean in a gallon jug !, 
   ok , where 's my nobel peace prize ? 
  [ here ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef0wdkm6g-4 ), 
  thank you for starting it !, 
  ok , it is over midnight in the uk now - who was it ? 
  just checked my bbc news feed and nothing there . 
  i live and work in the us and have done so for 15 years , i follow us politics from us sources on a daily basis . 
  and voter suppression is a lot worse than what you seems to think , inform yourself about the topic please . 
  that is the dumbest thing i have ever heard !, 
  she uses facts and attributed sources . 
  she always give a complete picture of the situation and asks all guests to correct anything she may have gotten wrong . 
  she regularly features segments where she corrects herself over issues earlier raised and where not all facts where known at the time . 
  she is happy to have serious and factual discussions with anyone , including republicans and she treats them all with respect . 
  living and working in the us for 15 years combined with an interest in politics , i think i know far more about us politics than most americans !, 
  yes but voter fraud is not the problem , voter suppression is !, 
  and the explanation is simple - not much to gain from voter fraud and that is not the problem . 
  voter suppression is the problem and the rachel maddow show has been on top of it , here are 5 different segments about the topic : [ rachel maddow voter suppression part 1 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvgvm3kqz8q ) [ rachel maddow voter suppression part 2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf83gekg8bs ) [ rachel maddow voter suppression part 3 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qr8hkpogii ) [ rachel maddow voter suppression part 4 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=praeet4zjf4 ) [ rachel maddow voter suppression part 5 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ierqycaptcq ), 
  i have lived and worked in the us now for 15 years and it is a generic us attitude , not one related to political parties . 
  the us is a horrid bureaucratic mess on all levels . 
  when it comes to creating bureaucracy , there is little difference between the two parties - heck there is very little difference between them in the first place . 
  the biggest problem in us politics , is [ american exceptionalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_exceptionalism ) . 
  americans can simply not fathom they are not unique in every which way , this again creates a barrier against learning from others . 
  the idea is that if things are bad in the us , they must be much worse everywhere else because usa is the best and greatest country on earth , so there ... 
  gop = = golden dawn, 
  it 's not the mindset but the party . 
  libertarianism is the ramblings of zit faced teenage boys !, 
  poland is europe 's kentucky !, 
  hyper-religious and extremely right wing . 
   i do n't care for church but pedophilia is n't funny imho . 
  then maybe you should be aware of how supportive the rcc is of pedophile priests and how they just ship them to a new parish and do n't tell anyone ? 
  `` culture of death '' yeah because rcc does n't worship a dead man and woman ? 
  nope no not at all , they even walk around with a torture instrument around their necks !, 
  is there any group as much focused on death as christians ? 
  `` you will go to hell !, 
  when you die '' is something we hear all too often from christians . 
  just more stupidity from the retards in the catholic church !, 
  in before the israeli downvote kibbutz arrives . 
  about time people stop buying products made in illegally occupied territories . 
  with a 65 year old ongoing war with it 's neighbors ? 
  never !, 
  we 're having one heck of a threesome up in the north !, 
  korporal ... 
  ok , let 's do so . 
  why should muslims get a special court in western countries when we do not get a special court in islamic countries ? 
   ... so there is definetly a basis for them feeling `` assaulted '' . 
  actually it is the exact opposite !, 
  what the muslims want , is to not have to follow the countries laws and legal system but have a special system just for them . 
  that is not being assaulted !, 
  that is demanding special treatment just because they are muslims . 
  want to have special muslim treatment ? 
  move to a damn islamic country since that is what you want !, 
  i would n't get a special atheistic court in saudi arabia , you think ?
