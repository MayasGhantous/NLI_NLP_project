   i 've hear people say jews have a victim-culture but i 'm sure they meant muslims . 
  no real difference . 
  i spent 2 years in unifil and could n't see much difference . 
  i 've stopped supporting any of the parties in the middle east - a bunch of idiots driven by thousands of years old tribal culture mixed with mythology . 
  the middle east could just as well be a different planet . 
  beanfart - now tagged in red as `` racist troll '' for later reference . 
  the political options used in the old one is just wrong , please make sure they fit better with european political landscape . 
  the old one is missing an important group like `` social democrats '' . 
   it 's always a good idea to get an outside perspective on things like elections , for any country !, 
  not for americans , they are offended over the idea since they are so damn [ exceptional ! ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_exceptionalism ) . 
  it 's difficult to find an american who think they have anything to learn from anyone else . 
  as a norwegian living and working in the us and following us politics closely , i will say that it is the way it should be . 
  republican controlled states have been hard at work limiting access for voters and disenfranchising voters all over . 
  it has been going on for a couple of years now and have intensified this year . 
  in many places , the republican pac 's are robo-calling people giving them false information about the voting process in order for the voters who they believe will vote democratic , to not vote . 
  edit : see [ rachel maddow on republican voter suppression ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei6n98i8yb0 ), 
  heh . . my favorite french film is an old one - [ la grande bouffe ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070130/ ) from imdb :  a group of men hire some prostitutes and go to a villa in the countryside . 
  there , they engage in group sex and resolve to eat themselves to death . 
  and these are so called `` moderate muslims '' . 
  i was lambasted in another thread for saying there are no moderate muslims and there are n't !, 
  fuck islam and all their retarded followers , moderate or not !, 
  countries of cargo origins yes , but not the owner of the ships . 
  norway has one of the largest merchant fleets by tonnage , a lot of ships are owned by european shipping companies but operates under [ flag of convenience ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_convenience ) so the actual country is masked due to tax issues . 
  shipping - not tourism !, 
  a lot of european commercial merchant shipping companies uses the panama canal and have to pay fees , now it can be done in euro rather than dollar . 
  people may not know this but there is a class of ships named after the panama canal , e.g. 
  oh the ** pan ** dering ... 
  `` african american '' is amerispeak for black . 
  it 's not accurate of course because you can be an `` african-american '' and be white , black or arab . 
  and in amerispeak whites are still white and not european-american ... 
  the us race issue is humongous , not so much in europe really . 
  in the us , you have ghettos were blacks live in run down areas which for the most part would have been deemed unfit for human occupation on the other side of the pond and leveled . 
  i live in the orlando area in florida and there is an area here called pine hills ( crime hills among locals ) which is almost 100 % black and quite rundown and a place to be avoided . 
  politicians have no interest in doing anything and white american do n't give a shit about blacks and their problems , besides - doing something about the problem will cost tax money , a lot of tax money and if there is anything an american hate , it is the idea of taxes and having to pay for someone else and especially black ones . 
  `` the chicago miracle '' , `` miracle at medinah '' ... ole !, 
  i take it you have never encountered the most famous [ swedish weapon of mass destrcution ? 
   it does n't seem like you know what you are talking about that alone about covers it !, 
  [ i guess you 'll simply love this then ?

  indeed - my favorite brewery is not even there , [ e. c. dahl 's brewery ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e._c._dahls_brewery ), 
   what if they are french citizens ? 
  let them know that if they want to live under islamic law and culture , they should move to an islamic country . 
  give them a choice of which islamic country they wish to migrate to . 
  pay for their travel . 
  give them a choice of islamic countries to migrate to , pay for their move and make sure they know that france will never bow down to islamic bullshit so if you are offended by living in a non-islamic country , migrate to an islamic country as you clearly would be a lot more happy there than in france where you seemingly hate the society and culture and laws . 
   but what if those people are from france ? 
  you ca n't send them back to some place their grandparents came from here france should learn from the americans - create a concentration camp like guantanamo bay and put them there ... / s, 
  norway 's internet coverage is only so high in order for people to find hook-ups for the next one-night stand ... ;-), 
  he was tagged in black as `` racist troll '' a long time ago and so far i have given him 81 downvotes i can see from res . 
  at the movies ? 
  you , sir !, 
  a winner !, 
  your first prize , a copy of the internet , will be sent to you on 434 million dvd 's !, 
   so , wait , you 're saying muslims can worship in exactly the way they wish to and that there are no restrictions in their homes and mosques - absolutely !, 
  so , you would have absolutely no problems with me moving in with you and start to reorganixe how things are done in your household . 
  you would be perfectly fine with that ? 
  i have absolutely no empathy or sympathy for that matter for people like muslims . 
  i 'm sorry , i have run out of my for-muslims-empathy stock . 
  it happened during my 2 years in [ unifil ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unifil ) , the same that made me a staunch anti-israeli !, 
  so , riddle me this ... why would a muslim want to move to a country where they by law are not permitted to display their mythological clothings ? 
  how stupid do you have to be in order for first to move then to complain ? 
  move the fuck to a muslim country if france is so bad , i 'm sure the french would n't mind !, 
  yeah , this is a joke and an old one , that 's why i put it in quotation marks . 
  there is another similar one but i could n't find it ! . 
  and yes , today i 'd take a japanese car over an american car any day of the week !, 
  `` happiness is a french wife , an american car , an english servant and a japanese cook misery is an american wife , a japanese car , a french servant and an english cook . '', 
   it 's reserved mostly for the conservatives and traditionalists . 
  unless you call [ rachel maddow ] ( http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/ns/msnbc_tv-rachel_maddow_show/#__utma=14933801.2092620647.1343583638.1347036790.1347643379.4&amp;__utmb=14933801.1.10.1347643379&amp;__utmc=14933801&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=14933801.1347036790.3.3.utmcsr=reddit.com | utmccn = % 28referral % 29 | utmcmd = referral | utmcct = / & __ utmv = 14933801 . | 8 = earned % 20by = msnbc | cover = 1 ^ 12 = landing % 20content = mixed = 1 ^ 13 = landing % 20hostname =www.nbcnews.com = 1 ^ 30 = visit % 20type % 20to % 20content = earned % 20to % 20mixed = 1 & __ utmk = 178380324 ) a conservative and traditionalist !,

   therefore , to get rid off war , you must get rid off people supporting soldiers and by extension war . 
  i agree but it is literally impossible in a country where the saying `` you can prey my guns away from my dead cold fingers ! '', 
  is normal and said in all earnest by a large swat of the population . 
  the american population have been brainwashed into a permanent state of scared-shitless and they are convinced they can not survive without a ton of guns and as a country without a gargantuan military !, 
  check out who mongolia is friend with !, 
  great stuff !, 
  surprised to see that mongolia 's 4th friend was sweden !, 
  so you ruin coffee with milk and complain about no good coffee ? 
  good coffee should always be enjoyed black and with no additives of any sort . 
  else you could just boil some water , add milk and sugar and be done . 
  but americans do n't think they have anything to learn form anyone so that solves that problem !, 
  not only that , it was a lot of infighting between various viking earls and kings . 
  the most well known and documented fight , happened on [ july 29th 1030 ce , the battle of stiklestad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_stiklestad ) . 
  it was our equivalent of the us civil war in the 1860 's , just 800 years earlier !, 
  in the next centuries , we figured out that trade and not plunder was the bestest thing in da world and we changed our ways and never looked back . 
  i see a lot of comments about oil but this is something that is much deeper in the norwegian soul . 
  it is the strong sense of right and wrong and the idea that everyone should have the ability to live in peace and comfort and not live a life of fear where dying either from bullets or starvation are the options . 
  nansen is a great example of this . 
  his tireless help for the people suffering after world war i. 
  his [ nansen passport ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nansen_passport ) helped almost half a million stateless people find home and migrate to where they wanted to live . 
  this work was formalized later into the [ nansen international office for refugees ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nansen_international_office_for_refugees ) . 
  however , i think the main change came after world war ii when we had to rebuild along with every other european nation where a strong social democratic movement took the reigns and thanks to the efforts from giants like prime minister [ einar gerhardsen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/einar_gerhardsen ) the concept of international solidarity was developed and became a focal point . 
  a clear impact by the [ socialist international ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_international ) organization and the right thing to do , e.g. 
  helping those who have less than you and are suffering from a less democratic rule . 
  and you know what ? 
  i 'm not shedding a tear over it !, 
  iceland , greenland , norway , sweden , finland and russia - not sure how norwayish that is but hey !, 
  european is used in advertising here in the us like the us is used in advertising in europe . 
  basically `` it 's great and it comes from over-there-somewhere and has sold in millions - now you ** must ** buy it too ! '',
