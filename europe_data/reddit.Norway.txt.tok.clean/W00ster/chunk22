  i did n't see anything specific to my country but i still liked it ... 
  you are talking about a handful of universities that most americans will never have anything to do with - we are talking about general education from 1st grade on !, 
  the us education has always been bad , this is not something new !, 
  the only great education in the us , can be found at the top universities , the rest not so much . 
  even back in 1925 , american school children were lied to in school and with [ the courts approval !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scopes_trial ), 
  the world has around 19,000 school districts covering a population of over 7 billion . 
  the us alone has over 13,000 of those school districts covering 300 + million - that 's your problem right there . 
  too many cooks !, 
  it is n't , he is treated just like everyone else but when you threaten to kill someone , society normally reacts !, 
  oh it 's mullah krekar - an insane moron !, 
  i do n't think he sounded danish . 
  as a norwegian i have to say it sounds neither norwegian nor swedish ... 
    i 'd always support my country , whether it was right or wrong . 
   only a moron would agree here ask an american and be surprised !, 
   you are a social democrat . 
  12 percent of the test participators are in the same category and 3 percent are more extremist than you . 
  [ graph ... ] ( http://www.politicaltest.net/test/graphic2/153727_eng.jpg ) not exactly surprising , been a social democrat my whole life . 
  your political compass economic left/right : -8.25 social libertarian/authoritarian : -7.69, 
  do n't worry , my tr\u00f8ndersk is most only used when visiting trondheim , when i speak norwegian these days , it is mostly in oslo dialect where i lived for many years . 
   hairy good , whorer yai so doorly oot ? 
  god , do i sound so bad ? 
  it 's an artificial language invented and made `` popular '' in the 30 's by national romantics !, 
  it sucks !, 
  six will do nicely too ... 
  damn - must have been really stoned !, 
  as 5 individual letters actually . 
  it 's an old slogan from the labor party who 's abbreviation is ` a '' it means `` i am in a too ! '', 
  i do , my native dialect is called [ tr\u00f8ndersk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tr%c3%b8ndersk ) '' \u00c6 e i a \u00e6 \u00e5 ! '', 
  is an example of a sentence in my dialect !, 
  the larger and more powerful a nation gets , the more of it 's resources are used to increase and maintain the power presence . 
  it siphons away resources other countries can spend on all the things you mentioned and which are noble things to spend money on . 
  in the old days of empires , at least there was an economic benefit from being a dominant power , today this has simply gone away and being a superpower today seems to be nothing but a humongous money drain on the country , ref . 
  the soviets and currently the us , who are spending over a trillion dollar per year on national security but next to nothing on the points you mentioned . 
  explain , please ... 
  wrong name - stupid website !, 
  `` living eu '' should be the name , it is certainly not `` living europe '' !, 
  why is it important to be a big power player ? 
  will that do anything to improve the conditions for the people living in the countries ? 
   i guess it must have been the government since you support 75 % of someones earnings going to it . 
  this is the problem when you pull shit out of your ass - you usually get it wrong !, 
  i do actually no such thing but do n't let facts get in the way of your mental masturbation !, 
   if the rich transfer their money into tax havens , then taxing them obviously does n't help . 
  that 's easy to fix - tax any money discovered in a foreign bank with 200 % tax and enact laws against shipping money off-shore !, 
  who earned the money ? 
  the share holder who did nothing but buy a few shares ? 
  you understand that the profits are not split among those who generated it but among the owners ? 
  define police state ... 
  it sure as hell is way more of a police state than norway is . 
  us police often act illegally , heck even some of the us sheriff 's are batshit crazy , ref [ joe arpaio ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joe_arapaio ) . 
  surstr\u00f6mming is classified as weapon of mass destruction so doing so would be pure evil !, 
  this is a useless table . 
  according to [ all-time olympic games medal table ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/all-time_olympic_games_medal_table ) : total number of medals : norway : 447 / 5.000.000 = 1/11816 finland : 456 / 5.410.000 = 1/11864 sweden : 604 / 9.400,000 = 1/15563 usa : 2549 / 310.000.000 = 1/121616 there are 11816 norwegians behind each olympic medal compared to 121616 americans behind each medal . 
   as a red-blooded american , i am solely concerned with the taste of my food , fat and calories be damned . 
  yes . . which is one of the reasons why you , via the tax bill , is paying more than twice for health care you do not get and on top of it , has to pay extra to an insurance company to maybe get treatment . 
  obesity costs americans tons of money - taxes nonetheless and if americans are so upset about their taxes , loosing weight will lead to reduction in overall tax pressure as less obesity related health care is needed and the money can be used to treat people with real illnesses and not i-ate-my-fat-ass-into-a-hospital-type of illnesses !, 
  does n't matter , a country can still enact laws in regards to residency requirements . 
  at least until eu becomes a federal mess like the us , then it is goodnight irene to europe !, 
  easy to fix ... just enact a law stating that you can not hold a major post or be the owner of a french based company unless you live in france . 
  and if they move , tax them 90 % on all assets they want to transfer out of country . 
  of course you did n't and i never hinted at you doing so either . 
  my point is that words have all kinds of unexpected backgrounds and origins and the word itself , may not necessarily say anything about it 's origin . 
  the words you gave , are to anyone with a slightest hint of education in german , obviously german but words like ` window ' , ` admiral ' and ` sofa ' do not reveal an obvious background and often leads the user to think these are native to his or her language when reality is quite different . 
  leave to where exactly ? 
  we always hear this nonsense but none of them tell us where they want to live and why it is better for them there . 
  let me be the first ( or something ) to say they will do no such thing . 
  in 10 years time , we will still see the same nincompoops living in france and complaining about the same things . 
   i challenge any culture to show me a superior meal to start to the day . 
  british breakfast , while tasting good , is health wise , a mess of fat and empty calories . 
  not exactly the type of food you should start your day with , in fact , a breakfast should not contain any fried food . 
  if you doubt this , quick look at obesity rates should set you straight , both american and british breakfast is nutritionally garbage and it shows on the obesity rates : [ health statistics  obesity ( most recent ) by country ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_obe-health-obesity ) rank countries amount \\ # 1 united states : 30.6 % \\ # 2 mexico : 24.2 % \\ # 3 united kingdom : 23 % ... \\ # 26 norway : 8.3 % so , your food sucks health wise !, 
  window ... a word that originated from old norse word `` vindauge '' , which in certain dialects sounded just like an older english version of `` window '' . 
  admiral - from arabic , just like ` sofa ' . 
  words comes from all over the world . 
  let 's bring back slavery - it 's about culture , you know !, 
  fta :  americans and australians may be english-speaking but they are none too keen on english eating , according to a survey . 
   people from the us and australia , as well as norway , voted the uk as having the worst local food , the poll by hotels.com found . 
  uk food is not that bad but it is n't something to celebrate either . 
  fish & chips - brilliant , kippers also cool . 
  not that i should be uppity on this topic , seeing i am from a country which eats [ smalahovud ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smalahove ) and [ rakfisk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rakfisk ) !, 
  ~ ~ circumcised ~ ~, 
  there are actually 5 not 4 !, 
  from [ list of multiple olympic medalists ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists#athletes_with_medals_in_different_disciplines ) :  ** gillis grafstr\u00f6m ** became the first person to win a medal in the same event in summer and winter olympics , winning figure skating golds at the 1920 olympics and at the first winter olympics in 1924 . 
  ** eddie eagan ** became the first person to win a medal in the winter olympics and in the summer olympics in different events . 
  he is the only summer and winter medalist to win gold medals in different events . 
  ** christa luding ** is the only person to win medals at the winter and summer games in the same year . 
  ( this feat is no longer possible due to the staggering of the winter and summer olympic years , though she is also the only person to win medals in successive winter and summer games or vice versa . ), 
  ** clara hughes ** is the first person to win multiple medals in both summer and winter games and holds the highest number of medals of any olympian to win medals in both the summer and winter games . 
  ** jacob tullin thams ** sailing and ski jumping, 
  [ yeah ... ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnwy9d0x5u1qh2mpqo1_500.gif ), 
  ahhh miriam , she was speaking perfect norwegian , what a doll !, 
   if you want a small idea of what winter sports means to norwegians , i suggest looking at the final minutes of the 4x10km cross country relay at the lilehammer olympics in 1994 . 
  the clip is from norwegian tv but just listen to the commentators and you 'll get the point and look at the sea of people cheering : [ 4x10km cross country relay finish ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lajlbdxr4b8 ), 
  i 'm sorry but that website only consider half of the olympics , you do n't have one that contains all of the olympic games ? 
  yepp - this is like americans claiming phelps is the greatest olympian of all time . 
  crazy because phelps , a swimmer , have what ? 
  20 chances of gold medals in each olympics compare to a marathon runner who has 1 !, 
  phelps is far from being the greatest olympian . 
  in my book , the greatest olympian is one of 4 people who has won gold in both summer and winter olympics !, 
  sovereign .
