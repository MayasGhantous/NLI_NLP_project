  why do you think that is ? 
   that you are your own responsibility . 
  incorrect !, 
  you can be as responsible as you possibly can , take every precaution there is , but you can still get killed at the blink of an eye because society as a whole is not doing the same . 
  this is not a personal issue but a social issue . 
  without enacting social change , you will forever be living in fear and were you will never be able to achieve your goal of taking responsibility for your own protection . 
  you can be 100 % responsible but still become a victim because it is not up to you alone !, 
  you do n't think countries with low crime is down to people taking responsibility for their own safety do you ? 
  no , they are down to the social situation in that country !, 
  as long as you have a large swat of your population living in abject poverty , a high number of crimes and often very violent crimes , is to be expected . 
  the best weapon against crime is social change !, 
  `` americans are clinging to their guns and bibles '' that statement is 100 % true to the core and as someone who is living and working i the us , i see it on a daily basis . 
  most americans have been brainwashed over decades to believe you can not survive without guns and a lot of them because either a ) the government will get you or b ) some bad guy will kill you just because . 
  i have never in my close to 20 years living here , had any use for any gun . 
  not to mention , according to most americans you should not survive in a country without guns . 
  this of course is a problem for them when faced with facts but as every great american knows , facts have a liberal bias so they should n't really be take too seriously . 
  and then finally we have the church of nra - the us gun lobby with it 's president , [ wayne lapierre - certifiably batshit insane ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwgabvhamiu ) !, 
  you can complain as much as you like , it will change nothing . 
  this is exactly the outcome i have been expecting since 1972 . 
  as much as i love the pigs , they have a completely different attitude toward economy , work ethics , debt and so on . 
  these are what i call the `` manana-countries '' where everything will not be done now but some time in the future , who really knows when ? 
  not to mention the economic differences between north and south . 
  i 'm sorry but i am not surprised at all of the current situation , just that it took so long !, 
  that was weired in a good way . 
  making real life into miniature models !, 
  here is a real good and funny take on [ the whole debacle ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  sure , that would be mecca - waziristan is just a mecca ... 
  there is only one way to punish companies for bad practices like this - hit them and hit them hard in their bank account !, 
  take how much apple corp internationally has profited from the iphone since it 's launch , then double it and call it the fine !, 
  [ you are a certified idiot !,

  one of my greatest meals was in fuengirola back in the 90 's . 
  the local company rep , a norwegian and their local friends , one of whom owned a local tiny restaurant , invited us on a bacalao night - oh my sweet cod !, 
  un-believ-able !, 
  amazing , never forget it !, 
  oh and they had to throw out the local client\u00e8le on the street so we could eat indoors , that is how small the place was !, 
  but they were happy sitting on the side walk and it was so much food , we simply decided to rotate some of them inside and feed them while some of us `` rested '' outside for a while ... 
  one of the great things about traveling or living in a foreign culture , is the local food and wine ... never understood the concept of traveling around the world for then to seek out the same food you eat at home ... granted , i have been living away from norway for many many years and i always enjoy getting back home and get some comfort food but i would starve if i could n't eat local food !, 
  now i am hungry ... 
  think i `` m going to order some indian vegetarian delivery today ... 
  one of the signs on the wall about the voting registration during one of the interviews had both english and norwegian so yes , i suspect there is a bunch of scandinavians too . 
  a friend of mine bought a house in marbella in the 80 's , it was plenty of norwegians living down there then . 
  i did some work in spain in the mid 90 's and found plenty of resident foreigners in the malaga area . 
  one of the things i have been anal about , has always been to learn the language if i was working in a country for a prolonged period of time . 
  nononononono ... no !, 
   `` when i get out of uni , do these countries even have engineers ? '', 
  no , no engineers anywhere to be found !, 
  no engineers made [ the troll platform ] ( http://oilrig-photos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/123.jpg ) nor the [ world 's longest road tunnel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5na5pzuhyy ) nor [ the bridge between sweden and denmark ] ( http://rejseudbud.dk/rejsebilleder/oeresundsbroen_bro_oeresund_danmark_sverige.bmp ) , so nope - no engineers !, 
  if you have no special skills that are in demand , not too much hope of getting any jobs nor visas i am afraid . 
  you will ** not ** get work visa just because you are american , you will either need a family bond or skills which are in demand . 
  and of course , applying for a job in a country you are not familiar with the local language is basically futile . 
  many countries have websites with immigration information . 
  [ here is the website for norway ] ( http://www.udi.no/norwegian-directorate-of-immigration/ ) ( in english ! ), 
  as long as you do n't bring [ one of these to the fight . . ] ( http://turut.no.24nb.serversenter.net/thumb_450.php?id=bilder_nettbutikk/1cf3e50486cc7deed2099864eae18818-image.jpeg ), 
  which is why your nick is tagged with `` troll '' in bright red !, 
  finn 's on vacation , just like us norwegians , are not capable of starting fights - we are too drunk !, 
  i love germans ... 
  in germany !, 
  i ca n't stand germans on vacation in the south . 
  most people ca n't stand us scandinavians on vacation in the south but we are just drunk - the germans are just assholes !, 
  hmmm no ulterior motif ? 
  `` backdoor '' and `` greece '' in the same sentence ... 
  even the poorest norwegian come across as rich when the average income in the country you compare it to , is below what the poorest norwegian has to live on . 
  context is everything !, 
  ahhh 1 'm a 1 % ... where is my money ? 
  look at that big brain and budget revenue on that lithuanian fellow !, 
  * sigh * not europe but eu !, 
  cultural enrichment does not happen through the mutilation of penises !, 
  this is why i hate religious groups - yes hate !, 
  they are making cutting off a tiny piece of skin into the most important issues ever . 
  these idiots think that some god creature would be pissed off if a boy still had his foreskin intact , for what reasons , i have no fucking clue - religion has always been the idea of the crazies so who knows ? 
  you know what jews and muslims - do n't like the law ? 
  move to fucking israel or some backward islamic country and cut your dicks all you want !, 
  when it comes to losing ( or winning if you like ) , my country has to be the champion . 
  i am not sure how many 0 points we have gotten over the years but we have had some nailbiters where we were praying for the last few countries to not give us any points so we would end up with 0 points !, 
  some of the best party nights have been on such occasions were people celebrated 0 points . 
  i know this may be difficult to understand for an american ... 
  thanks for the clarification , i lived in switzerland back in the 80 's and at that point , it worked the same way as in norway , e.g. , ammo was stored at home but what you are saying makes sense . 
  besides , normally laws require you to store the weapon split and with the sealed ammon in a third spot . 
   to be fair switzerland is armed to the teeth as well this is bullshit !, 
  the swiss have service weapons at home , just like many other countries with conscript armies . 
  these are not weapons to be used for anything and use of them outside of military exercises are illegal and will result in severe punishment . 
  for all practical purposes , the swiss is unarmed and yes , i have lived and worked in switzerland too !, 
   but because they spend so much money on military , we do n't have to . 
  if you had to , you 'd be doing something seriously wrong !, 
  the us needs a humongous military because of all the bullshit they enact around the world , overthrowing legally elected governments , installing right wing dictatorships and so forth . 
  these actions naturally makes people less inclined to support americans and it is easy to understand some person in a foreign country invaded by the us or with an overthrown government , thanks to the us , killing americans and quite frankly , had americans invaded my country , i would kill as many americans as i possibly could , would n't you ? 
  what goes around , comes around but that is what americans do n't like !, 
  they think they should be exceptional !, 
  ai n't that the truth !, 
  i like to call what they are screaming after not `` freedom '' but `` freedumb '' !, 
  oh this was oh so funny !, 
  living in the us , gives me these crappy us recruitment commercials on a daily basis . 
  the fap ` ing to the military here is insane and the commercials are so stupid you have to be mentally retarded to buy the nonsense they spew !, 
  here are some examples : [ army ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq-zvizjai8 ) [ navy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3wtucpwmei ) [ airforce ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fib3vrhpdns ),

  buda or pest ? 
  watch bbc 's great british railway journeys for plenty of interesting destinations . 
  based on [ bradshaw 's railway timetables ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_bradshaw#bradshaw.27s_railway_timetables ) from the 19th century !, 
  how about avoiding bois de boulogne at night time ?
