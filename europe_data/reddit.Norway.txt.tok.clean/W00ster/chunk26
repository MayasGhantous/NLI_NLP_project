  sure , there are a few americans but that does n't take away from the fact that the us as a nation , loves it 's military and basically worship them . 
  for instance , when i drive over to tampa to watch the bucs play , before the game there is a mental masturbation to the military , always !, 
  heck , even the pga tour have competitions where they have uniformed soldiers placed by each green to tend the flag . 
  and every american i see basically call all military heroes and if you do not thank them for their service to the country and the job they do to protect your `` freedom '' , you are viewed as a traitor or a commie/socialist foreigner who hates us liberty and freedom and the american way ( tm ), 
  norway with 5 million people have three official languages - one is so totally different from the two others that i do not understand a word of it !, 
  [ the sami language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sami_languages ) is weired and sounds more like finnish than norwegian . 
  edit : i should have included an example , [ here is norway 's esc entry 1980 : s\u00e1miid \u00c6dnan ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap3_usxkq34 ) it 's a horrible song but it illustrates the language . 
   i 'm sure that the united states is developing diverse cultures amongst it states . 
  not really no . 
  i have traveled to 40 states and quite frankly , the differences are cosmetic !, 
  the mental masturbation to the military in the us is sickening to the core . 
  the us military can simply , in the eyes of an american , do no wrong - they are per definition always the good guys , no matter what !, 
  damn !, 
  no damn !, 
  that was a new way of watching youtube videos i have never seen before - thanks man !, 
  this road is on the north west side of norway out against the atlantic , a very storm prone area . 
  i was born and raised a couple of hundred miles to the north of this area but i have never driven this road and it is the first video i have seen that was this dramatic - fantastic !, 
   we 'd all lose some national sovereignty but europe as a whole would benefit , it 's a zero-sum game . 
  i will accept this once some evidence for the claim has been produced . 
  at face value , it does not stand up to scrutiny !, 
   ... without realizing that it would n't be about a swedish voice , it would be about individual european voices . 
  and that is even worse , sweden with 9 million people against the voting bloc of let 's say germany with over 80 million . 
  a federal europe ala the us would be a disaster !, 
  the bigger richer countries would be in control - why occupy other countries when you can federalize them almost for free ? 
  the only metal i like , is gold . 
  i 'm sorry but metal is crap !, 
  this reminds of another language which can be damn difficult to understand - [ guttural danish !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  would it even be possible to get past the first 10 minutes without passing out from alcohol poisoning ? 
  seems to only cover eu countries so it 's not very accurate . 
  this has nothing to do with whether a culture is superior to another . 
  it has to do with how a culture has evolved toward being less mythology based and with the opportunities of expression . 
  nobody is going to convince me [ this is superior ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndxpyb1e7e4 ) to [ this !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwh3aneknjs ), 
  yes , i certainly do !, 
  finns do not use sexual reproduction but alcoholic reproduction !, 
   because my country is better than yours !, 
  yes , yes - i am pretty sure you country is better than mine in football !, 
  but - we have never lost to brazil even though we have played them 4 times !, 
  yepp , could not read the article . 
  bad idea to submit for-pay content !, 
  whale beef !, 
  my mum used to make some killer whale beef but thanks to eco-terrorists , it is very difficult to find anywhere these days . 
  fried whale beef with onions - yummy !, 
  czech beer !, 
  sorry , as much as i love german beer , no contest !, 
  same in the us where i live , the spongy bread is so full of chemicals it will not get moldy even after a week on the counter !, 
  finland are the balls , norway/sweden the dick !, 
  well ... that depends . 
  not a single blue haired 300 + kg new yorker anywhere around here . 
  there are retirement pockets in florida , such as [ the villages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_villages ) but i live just outside orlando , in [ longwood ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/longwood,_florida ) where it is no different population wise from any other place . 
  well , i currently live in the us and i am faced with this on a daily basis , e.g. 
  `` buy american '' there are [ bumper stickers ] ( http://www.zazzle.com/buy_american_bumper_sticker-128824266366309743 ) , directories for [ american made products ] ( http://www.americansworking.com/ ) , website such as [ `` i only buy american '' ] ( http://www.ionlybuyamerican.com/ ) and [ `` buy american mart ] ( http://www.buyamericanmart.com/ ) , and websites teaching you how to [ buy only american ] ( http://www.howtobuyamerican.com/index.php ) , and the us government even has a law , [ the buy american act ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buy_american ) . 
  i find this immensely stupid just like a `` buy european '' idea . 
  no kidding - my grandparents came from finnmark - cold and dark !, 
  dear portugal - that is not from sunshine but drugs !, 
  lol , that is why i live in florida . 
  `` the sunshine state '' 11am here now and 77f ( 25c ) . 
  `` awwww ... how cute !, 
  solar panels on greek columns ! '', 
  there is already energy transportation networks between the various countries so technically , it should be possible today to transfer energy . 
  some countries buy energy today from other countries . 
  the longer you work - the less productive you get !, 
  all studies done on the topic confirms this . 
  you need to read about [ the scandal of michigan 's emergency managers ] ( http://www.thenation.com/article/166297/scandal-michigans-emergency-managers ) : `` on january 20 the progressive think tank michigan forward and the detroit branch of the naacp sent a joint letter to michigan governor rick snyder expressing concern over public act 4 , the local government and school district fiscal accountability act . 
  signed into law in march 2011 , it granted unprecedented new powers to the state 's emergency managers ( ems ) , including breaking union contracts , taking over pension systems , setting school curriculums and even dissolving or disincorporating municipalities . 
  under pa 4 , ems , who are appointed by the governor , can `` exercise any power or authority of any officer , employee , department , board , commission or other similar entity of the local government whether elected or appointed . '' it is basically a local dictator who can do whatever he or she wants without any concern for the effects . 
  the us is a horribly bad role model to have for anything !, 
   the latest iraq war was not supported by all european countries you are correct on this but that does n't excuse all the countries that did jump . 
  mine included !, 
  but that is really not the point now , is it ? 
  the point is that the european countries basically always does what uncle usa wants us to do , no matter how stupid the activity is and in this regards , putin is correct . 
  and that putin is correct on this topic , does not mean russia is some paradise , just that putin this time was correct !, 
  well , as much as i dislike putin , i have to say he is correct !, 
  european countries compete about who can jump the highest when the us says `` jump ! '', 
  as much as i supported the `` no to eu '' in both referendums , i see no reason to be so uppity about the oil and gas incomes . 
  there are many other things we can be proud of , but remember , there is n't really that much difference between norway and sweden , finland and denmark . 
  when our closest neighbors does badly , so will norway no matter how much gas and oil we have as they are our main trading partners . 
  the oil and gas income gives norway a fantastic buffer for the future but it is not some divine thing keeping norway forever a golden cow . 
  interesting stuff but another author who do not understand the difference between eu , euro countries and europe ... 
  nope - i 've had many similar experiences , this was not unique by far . 
  what i provided here were two examples from the same event , totally unrelated examples , one with telefonica and one with a local company fixing water heaters . 
  i 've got plenty more examples if you are keen !, 
  no , the person worked for telefonica , my contact that is , he was a regional manager for isdn services . 
  the technician was employed by telefonica . 
  it was not an ethernet cable ( it was ibm 's token ring , not ethernet ) , it was several isdn cables and as i said , we had similar experiences with everything we needed to get done at the malaga office - everything took ten times longer and with a worse outcome in quality . 
   although things need to improve your perception that no one does anything is simple not true . 
  it 's not that they are not doing things - it is that whatever it is they are doing - it takes forever and then it is wrong !, 
  this may have improved over the past 10 years but ... microsoft is big too but it does n't mean their products are great !, 
  well , i have some interesting experiences work wise with southern europe and i can say it is in general , a very negative view of efficiency . 
  example : many years ago , i was going to set up a private network between norway and spain based upon ibm 's token ring network over isdn lines . 
  i set up and tested the norwegian side then set off to spain . 
  the spanish phone company , telefonica , had installed the isdn connections so it was working . 
  the problem was the cables we got from telefonica . 
  they were 3 meters in length but i needed several longer ones , up to 10 meters and when i asked the telefonica guy to get me some longer cables , he coudl n't - he only had pre-cut cables . 
  so i asked to get some longer cables made and after a day without any cables , i called and asked where they were . 
  he told me they had to come from madrid , this was in malaga and it would take 4 - four - days !, 
  pissed off around 4 in the afternoon , i called my norwegian supplier and gave him the details . 
  no problems - he 'd make me any length i needed , had them shipped with dhl and arrived before 10am next morning in malaga . 
  around 11 the telefonica guy called and wanted to know if i needed the cables - told him i had gotten what i needed overnighted from norway so thanks but no thanks !,
