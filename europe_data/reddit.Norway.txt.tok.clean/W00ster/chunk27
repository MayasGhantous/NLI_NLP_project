  now , you may imagine this was a one off situation but the office we installed in needed to get the water heater functioning and it needed an airhose from the burner to the wall outlet to let out steam and it was one of those accordion type hoses . 
  also pre-cut so when i asked the guy to go back out to his car and cut a longer one , he only had pre-cuts and it took us three fucking days to get a simple hose cut to the correct length . 
  it 's a fucking nightmare !, 
  i have no idea how businesses survives in these countries , nobody is doing anything and the nothing they are doing is taking an excessive amount of time !, 
  i could only get hold of my telefonica contact between 10am and 2pm . 
  at 2pm , he took siesta and he was never available after the siesta . 
  nobody is perfect - you are excused and hopefully fully cured ? 
   haha in a good way or a bad way ? 
  that my friend , is depending entirely on the amount of alcohol you have consumed prior to the start of the song !, 
  i hear they are classified as slightly worse than waterboarding ... 
  hey look !, 
  a nordic flag tower !, 
   the singer from cyprus standing on a pile of books but the only thing she sings is lalalalalaaa :d sounds like you just described 20 % of all esc songs ever ... ;-), 
  it 's borat 's baby-mama or sister if you like !, 
  `` the swedish music infestation '' - as long as i do n't have to deal with [ these kinds of swedes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq4x6buiwiw ) i 'm ok ... 
  i have never laughed so hard in a looooong time ... 
  the babushkas are amazing in a weired way ... 
  i hear this all the time , please explain exactly what is gay ? 
  all the hot women dressed in skimpily sexy outfits ? 
  or are you referring to the male dancers ? 
  or is it simply so outside of your comfort zone it automatically is labeled gay more out of fear for what you are than what it is ? 
   do people in europe really watch this ? 
  yes , normally we would have a party watching the show with drinking games for bad songs and hot women/men and then we would , if not too drunk , go out to some night clubs after the show ended and continue partying . 
  it 's not gay i have no idea why people call it gay , must be because it is not music they like so to them it becomes gay , stupid !, 
  it 's not music i listen to normally except when esc is on !, 
  and internationally , it has more viewers than superbowl but less viewers than your average formula 1 race . 
   if you equate eu members to us states . 
  europe is not equal to eu !, 
  learn it once and for all , please !, 
   do n't you find strange that the eurovision final is held on saturday night ? 
  not at all !, 
  it is the perfect voerspiel - have a few shots to bad songs , then you go out to party afterward !, 
   okay , something must be wrong with me yes ... you are danish !, 
  the biggest shock for americans watching esc will be the lack of fat people !, 
  challenge : [ try to spot the fat one !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=dch3hdz8eks#t=51s ), 
  oh well - then [ this one may also be to your liking !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04ttpfbfwo8 ), 
  esc is not [ very very gay ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boeph_ic-nm ) , some times you can [ find non-gay gay stuff ! ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsvemz1f5c ) ... 
  but most is [ not really really really gay !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59sxv_7yhrq ) / s, 
  it 's more like hoping americans will either die of laughter or have their heads explode from all the `` fantastic '' music !, 
  absolutely !, 
  we used to have esc parties to get plastered before going out to night clubs - heck some times we never reached any clubs as we got too drunk from drinking games during the contest !, 
  the whole point is to find the worst songs and that is not exactly difficult - i mean , there are so many of them it really ** is ** difficult !, 
   `` handegg '' i call it `` american armpitoval '' as they stick an oval into their sweaty armpits and then nothing happens and they go to commercial breaks !, 
  i 'm telling you it is difficult to be a bucs fan these days !, 
  we need a new gruden !, 
  bill hayden was gerald the mole - a traitor ... ;-) / lecarre mode off, 
  ca n't find a better voerspiel than eurovision !, 
   eurovision on the other hand is universally considered to be a bit of a joke . 
  it 's a perfect show to get plastered to !, 
  and the songs ... [ well , we once had this contestant !, 
  ( please do n't blame me for any mental problems you may get after watching the video !, 
  ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap3_usxkq34 ) but then again we also managed to [ present this one !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxwgzl4zx9o&amp;hd=1 ), 
  i was born and i am still a citizen of norway but for the past almost 20 years i have been living and working in the us . 
  i may have been a bit inaccurate as eu would have been more correct but then again , countries outside eu also feel the impact of the greek tragedy !, 
  [ tysk lekse ( german lecture kind of ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxmqdfwxzsq ), 
   a truly united europe could be much stronger than the us . 
  so , you are in a pissing contest with the americans - one really have to be dumb to do that !, 
  how long is the rest of europe going to suffer because of greece ? 
  it 's the pigs !, 
  it has always been the pigs !, 
  ( ** p ** ortugal / ** i ** taly / ** g ** reece / ** s ** pain ) the `` manana-lands '' of europe !, 
   common sense is one of the worst bases for making decisions . 
  common sense is what makes lynch mobs , and creationists , and global warming denialists . 
  i can not even start to tell you how much i agree and how spot on this is and it needs to be repeated to everyone !, 
  in the us these days , we hear a lot about common sense solutions in politics and i cringe every time i hear this nonsense . 
  almost every thing we previously called `` common sense '' has been shown to be wrong . 
  translation : i just pull stuff out of where the sun does n't shine !, 
  why did you post at all if you have no intention of suppling evidence to support your view . 
  and yes , it is an onus on you to provide evidence to support your claims . 
  and yet , you have n't given a single source as evidence , news.google.com is not a source nor evidence for anything . 
  since you have studied this for years , you should have a great deal of sources you can give us to support your claim . 
  right now , you come across as a religious kook refusing to supply evidence yet demand we accept your claim as gold . 
   personally i do n't understand being against the eu at all . 
  i think the eu is something that is profoundly good and something we should be proud of i do n't !, 
  and the reason is obvious , too huge differences between the member countries . 
  with both poor and rich countries , it is always going to be problems between them . 
  and eu , idealistically good as it seems , is not the end answer , as a matter of fact , it will continue to have an increasing amount of ever larger problems to deal with and the result is not going to be good . 
  wow , talk about going off on the deep end - please do n't stop taking your medication !, 
  austerity is the wrong way to go and will lead to greece going even deeper into recession . 
  working but i 'm free after 22:00 if you hop on a plane and fly to orlando florida , then grab a rental and take i-4 toward daytona beach , take a left off i-4 on sr-434 and you are almost there ... 
   thats a rather crass generalization sure it is ... 
  but it is also based upon close to 20 years of living and working in the us . 
  i have no illusions about norway being a paradise either but there is no doubt that in every aspect of life , from conception until grave , the average american would have been better off having been born in norway ( or any other nordic country for that matter ) . 
  many people point to the us as special and uses billionaires as an example but if one look at forbes magazines list of billionaires , one will quickly realize that a certain amount of people is needed to support a single billionaire . 
  currently the number is somewhere around 1 million people/billionaire . 
  the us and norway have both a rate of less than 1 million/billionaire but the us has a higher rate due to overall paying less to employees in wages . 
  the nordic countries and numerous other european countries are fairly evenly matched in the rate and currently germany seems like the best bet if you are aiming toward becoming the next billionaire . 
  here in the us with a rather high unemployment , they could have benefited from introducing paid maternity leave as it would require more people to be working , lowering unemployment and improving children 's health and future chances in life . 
  but that would be `` european socialism '' as gop and the right is calling it and the democrats are way too spineless to suggest any such thing . 
  well , i read somewhere that norway was the one-night-stand capitol of the world ... 
  must be served in old newspapers or else it simply does n't taste right ... 
  i think something there is something fishy here !, 
  there are only positive sides with a uhc system . 
  the problem with the us is that mythology reigns supreme in politics and we all know that mythology is always wrong . 
  the us is exactly the opposite of what it claims . 
  `` land of the free '' ?
