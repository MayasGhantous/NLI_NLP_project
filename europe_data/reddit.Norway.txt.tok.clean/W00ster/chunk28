  but americans still believe they are the best country in the world in every aspect , the brainwashing has succeeded , the us population are nothing but mindless drones . 
  [ i 'm waiting until may 17th ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nljiyl4gwtg&amp;feature=related ), 
  this is one of many reasons , yes but that link is not very good . 
  a much better link , albeit only in norwegian , would be [ historien om eu-kampen i norge ( pdf ) ] ( http://neitileu.no/media/filer/diverse_filer_for_nedlasting/div_nteu_papirer/historien_om_eu_kampen_i_norge_pdf ) one argument that was used by folkebevegelsen ( i was a member in 1972 ) was also the differences between north and south and it was woven into all the other arguments . 
  greece was at the end of the colonels , spain was railing under franco , portugal did n't look too good and italy was , as usual , in shambles . 
  we also knew the future would n't be better but worse and that they southern countries would become a huge burden for the rest of the countries . 
  except for the fact that the agreement and entrance into the eu would have opened up our fisheries for spanish trawlers and other such `` minor '' issues which would have had a very bad impact on the livelihood of a lot of people . 
  not really , no . 
   i challenge you to come to iceland , experience the northern lights , the never ending days , the amazing nature that can kill you if you are not careful i challenge you to come to norway , experience the northern lights , the never ending days , the amazing nature that can kill you if you are not careful, 
  one of the main reasons for why norway voted no to join [ eu back in 1973 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_ec_referendum,_1972 ) , was the argument that the differences between north and south were too big and that the south would , over time , impose an undue burden on the rest of the members financially . 
  seems like we got it right . 
  the `` machine '' is called a [ vaffeljern or waffle iron if you like ] ( http://www.kelkoo.no/c-100308023-vaffeljern.html ) . 
  and a recipe : you will need : 2 eggs 1,5 dl sugar 3 cups skim milk culture 3.5 dl milk 350 g flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 teaspoon cardamom 150 g melted butter break egg in a bowl and add milk , sift in flour and the add the rest of the ingredients . 
  mix well , let is sit for 10 minutes in a cold place . 
  `` lagom '' is the best word ever . 
   eating waffles is koselig and thank your host for a koselig time . 
  and to all non-norwegians , these are [ norwegian waffles or vafler ] ( http://www.levmed.vgs.no/~toreos/vafler.jpg ) , served with butter , strawberry jam and whipped cram ( not form bottle but whipped from cream ! ), 
  or with [ r\u00f8mme , a form of sour cream ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/roomx/5997259319/lightbox/ ), 
  [ `` nisselua '' ] ( http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/nisselue ) is santa claus hat which was used as a symbol against the germans during the wwii occupation of norway or a paper clip on your jacket , used as symbol against the nazi 's but we also have what we call a `` nisselue '' - culture basically indicating a bit of a naive society . 
  wrong !, 
  wrong !, 
  this is not unemployment in europe but unemployment in eu - not the same for crying out loud !, 
  the only good thing to come out of sweden , is [ volvo amazon ] ( http://driving-dutchman.com/wp-content/gallery/amazon/amazon-1.jpg ) and [ here is a piece of musical love for the car ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfw5ue3pnpa ), 
   please do n't pay attention to our pastors why not ? 
  you have millions of them and hundreds of millions who believe every fucking word that comes out of their mouths , so why should i not pay attention to your insane pastors again ? 
  there is a double warning in the title - `` american '' and `` pastor '' is a dead give away for insanity about to ensue !, 
  i love snow so much i have lived 20 years now in florida . 
   beautiful country , annoying alcohol sales laws . 
  which is why everyone i know , either now or at some period in time , have been dabbling in home production , aka moonshine . 
  and do n't forget one of my family members either - [ henry oliver rinnan - leader of rinnanbandedn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_rinnan ), 
  no not really , but damn i miss some good [ whale beef with fried onions !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whaling_in_norway ) , it is so damn good !, 
  well , it 's glaringly obvious that less access to guns means [ less homicides with firearms !, 
  i apologize for my ear bleeding ... 
  i 'm sure he did among the retarded right wing voters who gladly will vote for someone who will destroy their own lives because it is the right thing to do !, 
  it 's the same people who says `` keep the government out of my medicare ! '', 
   i 'm curious to hear about what romney would 've done . 
  you will never hear that !, 
  mostly because he has no idea what he would have done - romney is a just a walking talking point !, 
  it 's a man who can not put together a simple sentence stating what he actually wants to do and how - only what obama is doing wrong !, 
   i go to england for hookers nobody goes to england for hookers - brazil ? 
  sure but england ? 
  hell no !, 
  only roney and his dumb gop electorate believe anything obama does would lead the us to duplicate greece !, 
  us politics is the politics of idiots , for idiots !, 
  wow - that was painful to listen to !, 
  my ears are bleeding !, 
  til the economist do not know that norway is a country in europe !, 
  i 'm no expert on estonian it but you also have to remember there are two types of it companies , the ones you hear about because their end-product is a mass product , and then you have all the back end companies you never hear about but who 's products are used by other companies such as the front-line companies and are vital to their ability to mass market a product . 
  but , there is also a huge failure rate among startup companies anywhere in the world so it is to be expected that not every company but rather only a very few , end up with a success . 
  [ i know from where it flows !, 
  i 'm already here in the us , taking all your money ... muuiahhahaha ... 
  yeah , that was bad , so bad it deserves a cult following really !, 
  well , my country has a long and outstanding tradition of sending horrible songs receiving 0 points to esc , like [ mil etter mil ( mile after mile ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04ttpfbfwo8 ) it took some time before we , quite surprising i may add , won with [ bobbysox - la det svinge ( let it swing ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_iwb735vfs ), 
  well , i do n't understand the language either , it is sami , one of three official languages in norway and it 's just as strange as finnish to me !, 
  that , my friend , is the single worst entry in the eurovision song contest 60 + year long history and i am `` proud '' to say this piece of shit came from my country . 
  and yes , it will break glass , marriages , spleens , bring down airplanes and disperse protest marches more efficient then water cannons !, 
  hahahaha holy shit zombies ensues !, 
  i hope somebody never shows this guy my [ `` favorite '' esc song ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpcre52vu10 ) - please do n't blame me for any damages you may incur after watching that video !, 
   we 're at least all reading from the same book . 
  are you sure about this ? 
  the differences between north and south , east and west does not seem to indicate we are in the same book much less the same page . 
  it 's more like we are in the same section of the library . 
  i do n't see a european identity , there is little to nothing i have in common with someone from the southern or eastern rims of europe . 
  for most people in the north , the south is vacation land where we go to get sunburns , get drunk and get laid when the weather back home sucks too much !, 
  not pro-eu , voted against joining in the last referendum about eu . 
  and what we have just seen is exactly what we predicted would happen back in 1994 . 
  one of the arguments against eu are the huge differences between north and south , between west and east . 
  what happened to spain and greece was not a surprise to me , i had been expecting it for a long time . 
  also see , [ norway -- european union relations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norway_and_the_european_union ), 
  man i 've always loved to get high to melodi grand prix but living in the us , i really do n't get the opportunity any longer . 
  but it ca n't be that bad ... heads off to watch video ... ok , i was clearly wrong ... & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; not as bad as [ s\u00e1miid \u00c6dnan ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9xlmwbzh_q ) but close , real close ... let me be the first to guess norway close to the bottom this year !, 
   whereas those who tried to walk the road of the market just got richer and richer . 
  that must be the reason why nearly half of the us population either live in poverty or close to poverty . 
   my favorite all-time favorite drink is [ hexenfeuer ] ( http://www.spirits-expert24.com/0cache/mirrored_761528a273015386a24fbf52e845cbb8.jpg ) , esp when it is served in shot glasses with a fire burning on top !, 
  no , i have never had that one , it came into popularity after i left norway it seems . 
  turkish pepper !, 
  yummy !, 
  let 's hope they stop procreating altogether !, 
  greece has had it 's fair share of right wing morons , see [ greek military junta of 1967 -- 1974 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_military_junta_of_1967%e2%80%931974 ) - propped up by the us ... 
  with the bible in your hand - no problem . 
  plenty of support for slavery there , just claim religious discrimination if people tell you you can not own slaves . 
  not communist by a long shot but let 's be honest , the ussr had nothing to do with communism , it was a dictatorship . 
  i can honestly not think of a thing in the former soviet union that resembled communism . 
  no , they are swedes but speak funny  just like many swedes can not understand some of their dialects , so is it also in norway . 
  there are norwegian dialects i have serious problems understanding . 
  frp is the closest thing norway has to the us tea-party . 
  and they speak equally funny !, 
  nobody understands someone from sk\u00e5ne in south sweden !, 
  just ask a swede !, 
  hmmm ... 
  i have quite a few experiences with southern european work culture and quite frankly , it drove me completely crazy !, 
  spain is what i call `` manana-land '' where everything is to take place `` tomorrow '' , but not actually tomorrow but some time in the future and it drove me nuts !,
