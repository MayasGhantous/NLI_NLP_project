  the differences in work culture between north and south is unmistakable and there is a culture clash . 
  i am not surprised at all that spain and greece have such enormous problems - just that it took so long for them to surface and create problems . 
   do you feel nordic pride when norway wins all the gold medals ( fyi , sweden doesnt do that well ) yes ... ;-), 
  what a stupid retarded family - what the heck did these morons expect ? 
  yeah but every time i see something like this and it is very often on us tv to be honest , i can do nothing but think of [ ms. 
  teen south carolina and her `` brilliant '' comment about maps !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqdhmseqhfg ), 
  in sixth grade geography , we had tests were we got a blank map of the us and was told to name each state , state capitol and the major rivers . 
  so , yes , at least i could !, 
  france secret is that it is not the us !, 
   it 's a climate of witch hunt , what witch hunt and by whom ? 
  [ yes , you are !, 
  ] ( http://www.hotels-belgium.com/albums/brussels/fotos/brussels-mannekenpis3.jpg ), 
  i live and work in the us at the moment and have worked from home for almost 10 years now . 
  i simply love it !, 
  nothing beats sitting out by the pool working in january !, 
  lol yeah ... 
  i just love americans who ca n't stop telling the world they have free speech ( tm ) and yet the government will impose heavy fines on your tv station if you dare show a tit !, 
  free speech - my ass !, 
  so , i guess i know were my vacation trips will go for the next years . 
  have to check out the production quality , you know !, 
  lol !, 
  no no no it is a horrible idea !, 
  i was blown away by [ these 2 croatians ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msbyjqmgtau ), 
  this i do n't get , they accept someones text for gold . 
  when are these people going to wise up and figure out how to use webcams ? 
  it 's crazy that trade between 2 european neighboring countries have to use a currency belonging to a country on the other side of the world , just crazy !, 
  the world needs to stop using us dollars for anything in international trade as the us fascists are a problem for free trade !, 
  that was an awesome set of maps , tears are still streaming down my cheeks here , so funny , thanks for the link !, 
  latvia beat norway in hokey ? 
  wait !, 
  everyone beats norway in hokey so i have no idea why you are proud of that !, 
  two of my all time favorite movies : [ sweet movie ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072235/ ) by dusan makavejev [ la grande bouffe ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070130/ ) oh and i ca n't forget one from my childhood and my sexual awakening , the swedish epic movie [ r\u00f6tm\u00e5nad ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066320/ ), 
  of course it does - we are both good looking and good cooking ... and if you look at [ bocuse d'or or world cooking contest ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bocuse_d%27or ) , you will find a lot of scandinavians among the winners and runner-ups . 
  no , sheep - [ electric sheep ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electric_sheep ), 
  and to clean up the mess , in came a social democrat !, 
  why am i not surprised ? 
  it is always social democrats who has to clean up the mess made by the right !, 
  of course , in countries without social democrats , the problems are just getting worse . 
  norwegian living and working in florida for 15 years . 
   who am i ? 
  a good european !, 
  just like me , you are a great mix of many different origins . 
  a true european is a cocktail of origins !, 
  i 'm hungry , so yes , yes i 'd like some '' \u00f8l og p\u00f8lser '' !, 
  well , for someone from norway , it is nice ... we do actually get temperatures down to 0c during winter , esp now in february but not this year . 
  only had one day so far this winter with frost warnings . 
  most of the year , you never have to worry about what to wear when you go out , but the worst time is august - september where the humidity is very high and temperatures can reach easily 35c and to top it off , it is the height of the hurricane season  that si the time of the year i stay indoors in air conditioning !, 
  rest of the year , the climate is perfect !, 
  it 's chilly here today , only 18c , had around 28c the other day ... 
  here is now central florida . 
  my dad 's family were reindeer farmers in the north of norway and we used to get a huge package before christmas each year with reindeer meat . 
  my favorite was reindeer tongue , boiled and pressed and sliced thin , put on some good bread and enjoy !, 
  ate reindeer for christmas every year as a kid , delicious !, 
  but i also enjoyed whale beef with fried onions as a kid , my mom used it a lot . 
   sour-dough crisp black rye bread with a big juicy layer of fatty butter alongside a glass of milk ... that is something all estonians love until the day they die not estonian but that is just yummy, 
  pea-soup ... yummy !, 
  now i am hungry and i ca n't get any pea soup here in the us so i have to make it myself ... 
  the flags should be a dead give away in most cases but yes ... 
  [ here is my favorite dessert , multekrem ] ( http://www.dinmat.no/var/ezwebin_site/storage/images/media/images/multekrem2/619067-1-nor-no/multekrem_imagelarge.jpg ) multekrem = cloudberry cream of normal food staple , my favorite has to be [ kj\u00f8ttkaker med stua k\u00e5l ] ( http://nylonn.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/kjottkaker.jpg ) or meatcakes with cabbage stew and potatoes, 
  the us would have been perfect if it had n't been for all the americans living there . 
  nope , no place to check . 
  the best thing to do , is to treat the us like one treat somalia and similar countries and avoid traveling there . 
  it 's nice to see how right i am on this . 
  the eu is a disaster , too much differences between the northern and southern countries in eu good grief , people , are you really this stupid ? 
  the differences between north and south is there today and norway is not a member . 
  whether norway is a member or not has nothing to do with whether there are differences in the current eu between north and south . 
  there are too many social , cultural and financial differences between the various member countries for it to work in the long run . 
  what we are seeing now , is only the start - there will be more and more serious conflicts and differences in the future . 
  it would have been nice if it had worked but alas it is n't . 
  i have never been a fan of eu . 
  the problem is the large differences between the southern and northern countries . 
  we see this now , spain , italy and greece have problems , all mediterranean countries in the deep south . 
  these countries cost the others quite a bit of dough and the culture is so different it is difficult to get anything done . 
  spain has always been called `` manana-land '' where nothing is done now but manana , meaning not tomorrow but some time in the future . 
  i have some business experiences from spain and i shudder just thinking about them . 
  greece is a great country to vacation in but let 's be honest , i would n't do business with a greek company . 
  what we see now , is the start of the north-south problems in eu and they will not go away . 
  too many under-developed countries with a mentality not compatible with the rest of the countries . 
  all of this was the reason why i supported the no side in norwegian eu debate , twice . 
  do you remember who that was ? 
  an american idiot who can not even read and comprehend a short story !, 
  how unsurprising !, 
  even though norway is on that list , in 1999 the norwegian supreme court ruled in an extradition case that extraditing the person to the us would violate his human rights as no us prison satisfies the minimum standard for human occupation and that the sentences handed out could be compared to cruel and inhumane treatment and not in line with norwegian social norms . 
  first of all , the list is flawed , you are missing a large coffee consumer . 
  secondly , all the information you are trying to provide , already exists : [ list of countries by coffee consumption per capita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_coffee_consumption_per_capita ) : rank country coffee consumption 1 finland 12.0 kg 2 norway 9.9 kg 3 iceland 9.0 kg ( 2006 data ) 4 denmark 8.7 kg 5 netherlands 8.4 kg 6 sweden 8.2 kg 7 switzerland 7.9 kg 8 belgium luxembourg 6.8 kg 9 bosnia and herzegovina 6.2 kg 10 austria 6.1 kg 11 italy 5.9 kg 12 slovenia 5.8 kg 13 brazil 5.8 kg ( 2009 data ) 14 canada 5.7 kg ( 2006 data ) 15 germany 5.5 kg ( 2006 data ) 16 greece 5.5 kg, 
  besides , english , what other languages are you fluent in ? 
  it is a lot more difficult to get a job in a non-english language country if you have no grasp of the language . 
   extreme as in `` most anti-establishment '' rp is not `` anti-establishment '' , only anti federal establishment , he loves state establishment and wants each state to be able to decide whether they want slavery or if blacks should be allowed to vote and there should be no common laws for the country , each state is free to be as dumb as they possibly can be and they will under his nonsense rp wants the government in your lives , in every aspect of it , just not the federal government , it must be the state but then there are no limits to what rp will allows the government to do to you . 
  the us today is doing a reverse robin hood - stealing from the poor in order to give to the rich !, 
  do n't forget this is also a nation that elected the idiot ronald reagan twice !, 
   to be honest , i do n't think the politicians in questions are as dumb as they sound . 
  well , easy to figure out , just watch some speeches given when they are not campaigning . 
  unfortunately , after having watched us political tv for 13 years , i have n't found anyone who does n't sound like a complete moron . 
  wait , no that is not correct . 
  rep. weiner was a great guy , pressed out of the congress for no good reason over some pictures of himself . 
  the former rep from my district , alan greyson is also not bad . 
  the 99 % would have been much better off having been born in most european countries and certainly all nordic countries . 
  interestingly enough , the number of billionaires per capita is more or less the same between the us and the nordic countries .
