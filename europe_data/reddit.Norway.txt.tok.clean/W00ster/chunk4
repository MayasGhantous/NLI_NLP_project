  yeah , your post was lagom !, 
  it is my favorite swedish word - `` lagom '' * is * sweden !, 
  i guess it is the dutch word for what we norwegians call `` koselig '' , translates to english as `` cosy '' but it does n't even start to meet the real meaning . 
  could be similar to what we norwegians call [ `` lapskaus '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapskaus ) . 
  thicker than soup yet not a stew . 
  it is also used in the language to mean a big mess . 
  ( they made a bit of a lapskaus out of it ! ), 
   so , is there a translation anywhere ? 
  you know you can do that yourself , right ? 
  no they are not called that `` everywhere '' - only in the us . 
  only sparkling wine from the district of champagne , france can legally be called champagne . 
  there is no champagne produced in the us , so why not ? 
  well , when you of to a us store , you are more likely to find `` imitation cheese '' rather than the real deal !, 
  most of the so called cheese people buy , has been pre-cut into slices and wrapped in plastic , is not cheese but a chemical mix that looks not entirely unlike cheese !, 
  boston was a hotbed for ira support , both politically and financially . 
  many of the bombs set off by ira and many of their operations , were funded by bostonians . 
  a bit of poetic justice i guess , the boston bombing !, 
  geography is [ difficult for the average american !,

  oh come on !, 
  not bad for a blond !, 
  no , from selling company i started which adds nothing but money to the owners , of course . 
  i am east europe ladies man !, 
  i think the word you are looking for , is `` freedumb '' !, 
  me , living in the us for close to 20 years . 
  norway : discovered some growth , went to my doctor , he took a biopsy sample , sent it to lab , called me some days later said it had to be removed , bad skin cancer , he called around 8pm , had gotten outpatient procedure scheduled for next day at the local hospital at 1pm , i showed up , got it done in less than 1 hour . 
  2 weeks later , got a phone form the hospital , said they had not gotten it all and i had to come back , got a time , showed up , had it done and went home . 
  cost : 0 us : slipped on a wet floor , fell , crushed nose . 
  someone called ambulance , taken to hospital . 
  cost ambulance : $ 625 . 
  no major work at hospital , cost $ 1200 . 
  later needed a procedure to break the nose back into position , had to show up early at a hospital and then waited and waited and waited . 
  and while waiting , the staff called my insurance company to get permission . 
  last was covered by insurance so i just paid like $ 150 . 
  and i pay around $ 3000/year in insurance . 
   sure , i 'll get obama and boehner on the phone and fix it right now . 
  thanks for your helpful suggestion . 
  so , you think a uhc system in european countries happened after somebody called a politician ? 
  cute !, 
  you need to organize , actions needs to be taken , strikes may have to be done and you certainly need a movement and you need to engage people but then again , this usa so mcdoanld 's have a new dollar menu and desperate housewives is on tv so americans ca n't be bothered !, 
   he vast majority of americans know the healthcare system is garbage and yet - you do n't do shit about it except complain and feel superior !, 
  and the so called obamacare has just pushed a decent uhc system another 50-100 years down the road - good luck !, 
  may i recommend for those interested the excellent documentary made by bbc : [ berlin history - dangerous ideas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7n2hlkhevo ) [ berlin history - ruined visions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90w6dyxotdc ) [ berlin history - ich bin ein berliner ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g63fw1wfcpg ) if you are interested in berlin in the past century or so and the events related to east-west , see the last episode . 
  it has a piece about people escaping via micro planes !, 
  the former norwegian prime minister [ per borten ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/per_borten ) said , when his coalition government had to step down that it had been like trying to [ `` \u00c5 b\u00e6re staur '' ] ( http://www.slaattekurs.no/kapittel6/staur.jpg ) ( to carry a collection of rods ) . 
  the prime minister was also pictured in british newspapers working on his farm [ two days before the official visit by queen elisabeth !,

  there was an hour long tv program last week where they showed only super bowl commercials . 
  but since this is us , it was of course , interrupted by ... commercials !, 
  i guess you do not subscribe to / r/eurovision ? 
   i 'm still trying to figure out if that dude from last year was a vampire . 
  and therein lies your problem !, 
  eurovision is not something that should be analyzed , it should be watched , in a semi-drunken state and laughed at and all the countries you do not like , ridiculed . 
  when it is over , we wait another year - rinse and repeat !, 
  i 'm so sorry ... ;-), 
  yeah , they have changed a bit over the years !, 
  anyone remember top gear 's richard hammond [ racing a man with a jet pack in a skoda fabia 2000 rally car ?

  our only attempt , failed miserably !, 
  it was a car called , aptly so , [ troll !,

   hmmm ... depends on the average breasts size . 
  i heard good stories . 
  advice : never fall in love with a bra-size !, 
   \u0160koda when i was a kid back in the 60 's and 70 's , we had a joke in norwegian about \u0160koda :  hvorfor kj\u00f8re \u0160koda n\u00e5r du kan g\u00e5 da ? 
  in english it does n't sound funny but it means :  why drive a \u0160koda when you can walk ? 
  the pronunciation of '' \u0160koda '' and `` g\u00e5 da '' rhymes and it was seen as a better proposition to walk than to attempt driving a \u0160koda as their reputation was far from stellar !, 
  are you working for the tourist authorities ? 
  because now , after watching all those beautiful pictures - i do want to visit !, 
  not norway ... 
  kalkun ... and the country is called tyrkia . 
  did it fell good fucking andorra ? 
   you think that 's bad , we 're orange . 
  hmmm is it now i am going to be a racist ? 
  you know - orange is the new black ? 
   there must be a reason ... quia sculpsit illud caesaris !, 
  you two - get a room !, 
  i think you will find it is an old chinese proverb and not klingon . 
   what the hell do you do in +45 ? 
  well , we do not have that high here in florida but the summer can be hot in the 30 's and with very high humidity and the best thing to do , is to stay indoors with the ac running . 
  i treat it like i did treat winters in norway - stay out of the weather and indoors as much as possible . 
  for florida this means july - september being indoor time , my ` winter ' !, 
  hear !, 
  hear !, 
  i now live in florida - two days this winter , i 've had to put on the heater and a long sleeved shirt !, 
  that should be two words : ` sauna ' and ` vodka ' !, 
  [ that question is difficult to answer !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cehma1q-ssm ), 
  i drink like 2 pots a day . 
  i could not survive without coffee and a lot of it !, 
  of course , some sweets to go with it , is just mandatory . 
  i 'll think i have a butterfinger bite right now ... 
  it is evidence for the one true god - the flying spaghetti monster !, 
  round them up and send them all to the land of the free !, 
  we could call the camp `` the roman empire '' ... 
  it is meant as a reserve for the future , see [ the government pension fund of norway ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_government_pension_fund_of_norway ), 
   it might not be perfect nobody are but you dutchies are among my favorites , great place !,
