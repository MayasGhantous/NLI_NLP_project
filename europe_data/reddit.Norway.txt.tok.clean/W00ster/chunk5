   i personally like the right to bear arms in the us why ? 
  i have lived here almost 20 years and have not a single time in all those years had any need for a gun . 
  you have lived in europe ? 
  wow , really ? 
  i suppose you then also would know that europe is not a country so your comparison is shit . 
  i 'd rather live in the us than many other places . 
  how many other countries have you lived and worked in for comparisons ? 
  i have lived and worked in 6 different countries , currently in the us . 
  the us is great if you are white , have a great education and a high paying job with little to no debt and are healthy . 
  if you do not fit into this category , the us is a shitty country and most other civilized countries are preferable to live in . 
  welcome to the land of fascism !, 
  so ... michael ... 
  the terrorists won then ... 
  i will never - never - bend over backwards for these illiterate morons wallowing in mythology !, 
  the world needs to stand up to religious extremism and terrorism and say enough !, 
  if you are so fickle about your mythology that you can not stand anybody criticizing it , ** you ** are the problem , not me !, 
  i 'm moving my assets to this bank !, 
   a greedy army of lawyers getting a 30 % cut from the winnings plus all costs reimbursed . 
  another one who extrapolates the us garbage system onto the rest of the world . 
  are you really this stupid ? 
  sorry i have to ask but this is crap . 
  in civilized countries under civil law and not common law , enormous settlements are not seen for many reasons . 
  we do not want the us retarded judicial system , it 's that simple . 
  your system sucks . 
   should n't you have a chance to get redress from your own national courts ? 
  case closed - such a system would be an international judicial nightmare . 
  it is pure bullshit !, 
   the small guy sticking it to the large corporation fantasy !, 
  the large corporation comes with an army of lawyers and millions of dollars to burn , what do you have ? 
   edit : can somebody explain why this comment of mine is being downvoted ? 
  because it is insanity for an american to sue a foreign company for her own stupidity and inside the us where no us courts have jurisdiction over an austrian company . 
  she should have sued in austria , not the us . 
  imagine , this dumb cow , visiting iceland and breaking her foot in an ice crevice , returns home and then sues you in a us court because it was on your property and you are found guilty by a court in a land you have never visited and have to pay a us $ 20 million settlement ? 
  i live in central florida , the [ greater orlando area ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_orlando ) with around 2.1 million people , [ this is the central train station !, 
  ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/14286748.jpg ), 
  i was almost killed , twice , in london bombings by the ira , bombings enabled by money collected in the boston area . 
  bostons usa was a staunch supporter of ira . 
  so , it really was kind of poetic justice to see the boston bombing . 
  so , who do i sue ? 
  city of boston ? 
  state of massachusetts ? 
  the us government ? 
   keep in mind that all that she has won is the right to sue a us court can ** not ** give her the right to sue ** in usa ** a ** foreign ** company . 
  us courts have jurisdiction over what happens inside us territory and austria is not by a long shot , an american territory so the us has no jurisdiction and can not sue the austrian railways for anything . 
  this is a ridiculous us bullshit joke , another one !, 
  this is what really makes the world laugh at the us and shake their heads at us idiocy at its finest !, 
  well , what the fuck do you expect ? 
  on the outside mirrors on us cars it says '' the objects seen in the mirror appears to be further away than they are ! '', 
  you get usage instructions on the most banal things here and trains are a bit of a mystery to americans so i am not surprised she had no clue how to use one !, 
  and some of us prefer meatballs in an [ even more `` correct '' way !,

  ahhh it is a `` handy guide to british politicism '' . 
  sigh ... 
  i wrote :  it is ridiculous of course . 
  more a jab at our swedish brothers . 
  lol no , rather that immigrants are happily integrated in norway but in sweden , not so much ... 
  it is ridiculous of course . 
  more a jab at our swedish brothers . 
    traditional dish is lye-treated codfish . 
    we eat cooked salted codfish , but it 's seems to be the same when i searched the wiki page [ 1 ] . 
  also we have so many ways to eat codfish . 
  and it is not swedish but norwegian . 
  not surprising portugal use a lot of the food , we sell you a lot of [ klippfisk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klippfisk ) , who does n't love a good [ bacalhau ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bacalhau ) ? 
  i have n't followed the debacle closely but as a loose guideline , i would say : 1 . 
  politicians ? 
  no problem , they are public figures and should stand by what they are saying . 
  a normal medel svenson ( regular joe ) - not so much , no matter how racist they are . 
  a modicum of privacy has to go along with freedom of speech . 
  once they go from speech to action , the picture changes . 
  there is no reason why immigration and its problems/benefits should not be discussed seriously in public but that also should mean all the overt racist slur needs to stop for a serious discussion to take place . 
  yeah or more accurate , the difference in sound and pronunciation of `` ch '' , `` sch '' and `` g '' just like `` de muis is in de doos '' teaches the difference in pronunciation of `` muis '' and `` doos '', 
  yes , i have worked and lived in 6 countries , currently in the us and yes , learning and using the language is a definite plus . 
  so , yes , does n't matter from where you come . 
  i guess it is to learn the sounds . 
  i learned the following one :  achtentachtig kacheltjes in een gracht in scheveningen if you are dutch you will know which sounds it is trying to teach you . 
   if you are n't able to practice it , you will forget it in an instant i learned dutch back in the 70 's . 
  i can speak it but i 'm much more comfortable with reading than speaking dutch . 
  a few weeks in the netherlands would change that undoubtedly . 
  well , the [ danish language is weired !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  you move to a country with a language you do not know . 
  you do no effort to learn the language . 
  the jobs you will get are shitty jobs paying nothing and you have no future . 
  it should be mandatory for every immigrant to learn the language . 
  and as an immigrant to a new country , why would you not want to learn the language ? 
  i agree 100 % with a demand to pass a language test before you are afforded residency and citizenship . 
  if immigrants are not willing to comply , they are free to move wherever they want and are accepted . 
  nobody is forcing them to stay in the netherlands . 
   what ` ya yelling about up there in them mountains norwegian is my citizenship and for the moment , i live in the `` mountainous '' florida !,

  to be honest , it 's so flat it 's not difficult to be blown away !, 
  i 'm not up to speed on the ukrainian-moldovan-georgian relationship . 
  can someone more knowledgeable explain why this important ? 
  i 'm happy they are pro-europe but what direct impact can they have on their countries relations to europe and russia ? 
    even though they talk funny . 
   that i can agree with . 
  that is funny coming from a finn !,
