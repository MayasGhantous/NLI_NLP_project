  we are really happy with you thinking you are and we continue to enjoy our money while you enjoy being the `` scandinavian powerhouse . '', 
  that was weired to look at , the flags and the countries made it strange . 
  but i agree , that looks pretty correct when it comes to making jokes . 
  140kph is a very strong [ category 1 hurricane or tropical cyclone if you lie . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tropical_cyclone_scales ) not something to ignore for sure but not really that bad . 
  i 've been through much worse hurricanes here in florida . 
  and as always , it is not the wind that kills , it is debris and the storm surge . 
  which is why it is night in vladivostok but time is noon !, 
  edit : ok , why is this downvoted ? 
  moscow time is standard time in all of russia . 
  the trans siberian railway runs on moscow time . 
  right now it is friday , december 6 , 2013 at 10:09:40 am but in moscow it is friday , december 6 , 2013 at 3:10:03 am . 
  officially , the time in vladivostok is the same as in moscow , e.g it is not 10 in the morning but 3 in the morning . 
  better hurry up before they [ get too heavy !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/obesity_in_the_united_kingdom ), 
  europe is divided north-south . 
  they are two very different cultures and set of languages . 
  i simply think the difference between north and south are too big for a union including both to succeed in the long run . 
  i know this is not a popular attitude to hold and some say it is elitist but this has nothing to do with one being better or worse but with reality . 
  the economic differences between north and south are too great . 
  this is not a suggestion based upon feeling better or different but based upon economic , cultural and social differences . 
  hmm . . 
  so , let 's say the uk left eu , teamed up with the nordic countries and the baltic states for the nu ( nordic union ) ? 
  one northern and one southern union ? 
  no , no ... not at all ... 
  the british vomitpire is all over the world . 
  and that 's your problem right there !, 
  just wait until romania has been invaded by pink brits who are drunk 24/7 , vomiting all over the place and demand british food . 
  romania - i would suggest a trip to europe 's vacation destinations first before you invite them over . 
  might not have the result you were hoping for !, 
  i guess it is time to post [ this pearl again ?

  good !, 
  its a practice that needs to disappear !, 
  using iron age mythology as justification to continue the mutilation , is simply ridiculous !, 
   ` english tea ' in milan , that 's your problem right there . 
  but then again , `` english tea '' is in itself disgusting so i do not understand the problem . 
  what is wrong with tea ? 
  why do you have to ruin it with adding copious amounts of sugar , lemon and milk ? 
  me neither but [ mediterranean cyclones ] ( http://www.pandowae.de/en/research/high-impact-weather/mediterranean-cyclones ) says it 's the perfect time now for them and there have been some before but i can not say i 've heard of them . 
  oh that 's a brilliant subred !, 
   aaaw , good old propaganda , fodder for the stupid , cheap and effective . 
  it 's like an artist rendition of the world according to a russian rush limbaugh !, 
  should be treated the same way also . 
  hahaha yeah , swiss-german is not easy . 
  i lived in the saas-fee/saas-grund area back in the 80 's so i have a lot of experience with it , she was cute btw :-), 
   but the accent is such a mess for german ears ( at least germans from the north ) ehhh . . [ plattdeutsch ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/low_german ) is not always easy to understand for a foreigner even if they have background in german . 
  lol - thanks for the laugh !, 
  what a joke he was .

  is the last line all from the same language ? 
  looked like a mix of mandarin and japanese btw . 
  how do i know your publication is pure garbage ? 
  simply because you dumbos think europe equals eu . 
  fuck you , morons !, 
   but do you really learn english watching subtitled stuff ? 
  yes !, 
  yes , you do !, 
  i always listened to the original conversation and the subtitles were just a support for words i had not heard before but which became obvious and easy thanks to the subtitles . 
  i absolutely loath dubbing !, 
  many many moons ago , when i was young and hot , i worked as a ski teacher in switzerland and one night , i watched the then hot series `` dallas '' dubbed in german , french and italian , the same night !, 
  watching jr speak french was just stupid when he is a texan . 
  it was vomit worthy !, 
   i could n't tell if the person was swedish or american . 
  just look at the size !, 
  i 'm speaking english in norwegian !, 
  of course not !, 
  you are drunk all the time so ... ;-), 
  spot on !, 
  you hit the nail on the head . 
  it is not mentally ill people seeking asylum , it is people who has mental issues as a result of the problems they are seeking asylum from !, 
   ok tell me this . 
  why do we not have some sort of mental test that asylum seekers need to pass before they can enter the country ? 
  because their mental issues are often directly related to the reason why they are seeking asylum . 
  hmmm [ are you sure ?

  south korea is ranked 50 with a score of 24.48 and japan is ranked 53 with a score of 25.17 .

  i do n't like this map at all . 
  it is designed to give certain countries a better look than is warranted .
