   how easy is german to understand for a norwegian ? 
  pretty easy . 
  german grammar is different . 
  dutch is even easier to learn for a norwegian . 
  as a kid , i remember i was so surprised when i heard dutch speed skaters [ ard schenk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ard_schenk ) and [ kees verkerk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kees_verkerk ) speaking fluent norwegian . 
  i later learned the language and lived for some time in [ haarlem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haarlem ) outside amsterdam . 
  [ scandinavism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavism ) , aka `` nordism '' sounds good ...

  once , i was hit by shrapnels , the other time , i was less than a minute away from having been killed as i was walking toward the place were the bomb was . 
  both bomb attempts were made possible thanks to financial and political support from irish descendants in the boston area .

  my hometowns cathedral was started in 1030ce and was completed in 1996 , a year before the city 's 1000 year jubilee . 
   they were lucky to jump on the train when they did and did n't have a system in place that made it difficult to innovate .

  what are you afraid of ? 
  and he is 100 % correct in his observations of the us , he has been living here and know the country . 
  in many areas , the us is so ridiculously far behind technologically that it ai n't even funny . 
  banking is one area where the us is basically still using 19th century technology such as paper checks .

  people must not forget the us [ has been in continuous military actions around the world since 1775 !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_united_states_military_operations ) some also mentioned , getting rid of assad would enable a pipeline from the oil fields in the middle east to europe , competing with the russian pipelines .

  when the markets crashed in 2007 , many americans saw their retirement savings disappear or being halved or worse . 
  many americans now work well into the 70 's because they can not afford to retire . 
  i find the whole idea that the health of wall street should have a direct impact on your retirement to be disgusting !, 
  it is better to keep you mouth shut and let people wonder if you are an idiot rather than to open it and remove all doubt !,
