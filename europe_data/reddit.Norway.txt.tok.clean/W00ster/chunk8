  do n't forget , hamburg 's greatest tourist attraction - [ reeperbahn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reperbahn ) . 
  hamburg 's `` sex-paradise '' ... 
  you must never have visited norway - we may be happy but we sure love to complain !, 
   what an obnoxious problem . 
  `` oh , my country is so wealthy and egalitarian that i have trouble thinking of reasons to complain . 
  you have no idea how hard it is . '', 
  well , it is better than the us model : `` oh , my country is so wealthy and unequal that i have no troubles thinking of reasons to complain . 
  you have no idea how hard it is . '', 
   dutch here . 
  this makes me happy . 
  i 'm happy - you are happy !, 
  that is until some damn russian beat us in speed skating !, 
  see [ skiing in australia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skiing_in_australia ) . 
  worked as a ski teacher many many moons ago in switzerland alongside aussies and kiwi 's !, 
   norway in hockey ok - just rub it in !, 
  neutrality , sweden , neutrality ? 
  where is it ? 
  * only * 36 ? 
  ahhh . . rip david !, 
  you 'll be sorely missed !, 
  [ nixon interview with david frost ( 1 of 6 ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c4dbxfdotg ) is a brilliant example of what journalism should look like !, 
  yepp , sounds about right . 
  the first word is the description of an apparatus used to measure the distance between particles in crystalline materials . 
  the second word describes positions of leadership related to traffic safety in a county . 
  i ca n't get myself to call them roma - that is the name of the italian capital and not the name of bums - at least to me !, 
  [ a norway passage - the most beautiful voyage ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_vujwfzeg8 ) - about the coastal ship called [ hurtigruten ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hurtigruten ) - norway 's coastal `` highway # 1 '' and the breathtaking scenery found along the 5 day trip !, 
  because it is simpler my way . 
   but 143.5 ( sincos2 ( 10 \u00b0 ) ) ? 
  i think not . 
  agreed but then again , that is not really topics for the grades discussed . 
  however , you should be able to square half numbers without the use of a calculator . 
  e.g 2.5 ^ 2 or any n. 5 ^ 2 . 
  it is easy . 
  in order to avoid any embarrassment for those who has never learned how to : n \\* ( n +1 ) +.25 is the correct formula . 
  2.5 ^ 2 is 2 \\* 3 +.25 or 6.25, 
   because only far right ideologies can lead to violent actions , amirite ? 
  another one who knows very little about european terrorism i can see !, 
  most terrorism in europe from the 60 's onward has been left wing , remember [ red army faction or baader-meinhof group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baader-meinhof ) and [ brigate rosse or red brigades ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_brigades ) ? 
  i completely agree !, 
  well , i have used linux as my main os since 1995 and i have never , not once in my work , gotten any documents i could not open with an open source alternative . 
  last windows machine i owned was running windows 95 . 
  well , that is easy to fix and one of the first things you do after install , e.g. 
  to remove the lenses that are a problem . 
  $ sudo apt-get remove unity-lens-shopping unity-lens-music unity-lens-photos unity-lens-video and it is gone !, 
  blame the roma . 
  what are they doing beyond traveling around stealing and begging and polluting ? 
  i 'm sorry to burst your bubble , but those changes have very little to nothing to do with the overall idea of how americans see themselves . 
  each generation go through the same , some areas are shifted socially but overall , the same old same old persists . 
  the internet have in reality done no such thing unfortunately . 
  if you look at what an average internet user do on the net , i can assure you it is not geared toward `` lessening isolationism '' but toward watching cat pictures and reinforcing what they already believe . 
  edit : let me include some actual evidence for this . 
  yes , on some social issues , there have been a change , but in many other , equally important areas , no change and this is from over 65 years of polling . 
  see [ long-term gallup poll trends : a portrait of american public opinion through the century ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/3400/longterm-gallup-poll-trends-portrait-american-public-opinion.aspx ), 
  yes , but this was back in the 90 's and telefonica was the only one who delivered isdn connections , which we needed in order to route token ring network packets wrapped in tcp/ip and then in a wan protocol and routed over the isdn data channel . 
  now , i do n't know about you but i have lived and worked in the us now for near 20 years and yes , americans all over the country , i have visited most states , have the same idea of themselves . 
  and just have a quick look [ at this one , will ya ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hecwqwx2yu ), 
   they all speak the same language they do n't . 
  tens of millions americans more or less only speaks spanish and can barely get by in english , if at all . 
  asian immigrants very often speak very little english , even for the second and third generation as they tend to live in ghettos where everyone are from their home country and nobody uses english other than to converse with other americans in their jobs and then not very well either . 
  not many years ago , i could not communicate with the people who cleaned our offices as the lady spoke no english at all . 
   you need to read some literature to even begin understanding what ways americans believe this . 
  all you * actually * have to read , is the wikipedia entry on [ american exceptionalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_exceptionalism ) . 
  but be careful - that page may make you want to vomit . 
  well , my experiences with spanish work culture has been rather abysmal to say the least . 
  we call spain `` manana-land '' where nothing is done today but some time in the future . 
  the difference between the northern european countries and the southern ones in questions like this , are staggering . 
  which is why a friend of mine , a plumber who ran his own plumbing company , after having bought a vacation home in spain , got totally frustrated with the spanish lack of urgency and the lack of ability to fix things on-site , opened his own plumbing company in spain . 
  he was a success because they came when they said , had all the tools and equipment to fix the problem there and then and he charged slightly more . 
  made tons of money !, 
  and do n't get me started on telefonica - i hate those idiots . 
  it was faster for me to buy the equipment i needed in norway and have them send it with dhl over night to my location in spain . 
  telefonica promised me the parts in 3-4 days because they had to be sent from madrid to malaga !, 
  top that off by never being able to track down my contact in telefonica because he spent the afternoons with his mistress !, 
   have you ever met a frenchman that did n't think his culture was vastly superior to anyone else in history ? 
  tons of them !, 
  but then again , i have , probably contrary to you , spent quite a bit of time in france and speak the language while you probably base your opinion of the french based upon the cartoonish portrayals in us media . 
   it looks that the younger generation is a lot less nationalistic than the older generations . 
  yes - but that is 100 % wrong !, 
  if you had gone back to the , let 's say , 1970 's and asked the same question , you 'd see the same distribution . 
  you make the logical fallacy of looking at one poll and drawing bombastic conclusions based upon it . 
  * that * is about the worst thing you can do !, 
  the young generations change their views as they get older . 
   germans are n't that bad imo well , as much as i like germany , from my first vacation on gran canaria back in 1977 , one experience still lingers . 
  a german tourist pestering a poor hotel waiter for a bottle of piccolo , something the waiter had never heard of and the german got more and more irate . 
  but yeah , germans on vacation can be difficult , some brits too but you can easily recognize them with their bright pink skin or if they have been there a few days , their heavy sunburns and avoid them . 
  i do n't know if this is anything but negative but [ this is how we norwegians see each other !, 
  ] ( http://images.uncyc.org/no/d/d7/ola_nordmann.jpg ) he is called [ ola nordmann ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ola_nordmann ) !, 
  and would you know ? 
  wikipedia has a page on [ national personification . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_personification ), 
  the 90mbps service will cost around $ 90 + but you will most likely never be able to see an actual speed of 90mbps according to hundreds of users experiences . 
  well , i currently live in the us , central florida to be specific . 
  they are working on improving to the blazing lightning fast speed of 90mbps . 
  i asked them when they thought they would be able to offer me the same speed as my brother was getting in stockholm , 1gbps - crickets !, 
   france : almost as good as the worst scandinavian country . 
  interesting because i have always viewed france as a bit of a pioneer in telecommunications . 
  misleading title - eu not europe . 
  what if i told you that homosexuals are natures way of regulating the health of our genetic material ? 
  the more unhealthy a population groups genetic material gets , the more people become homosexuals ( e.g.
