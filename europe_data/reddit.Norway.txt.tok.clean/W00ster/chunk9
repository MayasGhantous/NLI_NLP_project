  they should be your heroes !, 
  what would you say then ? 
  why ? 
  how does it affect you personally ? 
   go see what kind of reactions you get when you say `` i do n't like them gay parades '' my reply will then always be the same : do n't go to one and do n't watch it . 
  how difficult is that ? 
  but i will never allow you to oppress them just because * you * do n't like them !, 
  if you are a straight man , allowing gays to marry will not affect you one iota . 
  it will have a great positive effect on the gays however that they are allowed to marry . 
  even more inexplicable are the cries from the family crowd , that is exactly what the gays want to be , a family , legally recognized as one . 
  why is it so difficult to afford other groups the same legal rights you yourself have ? 
  is it [ `` the `` last place aversion '' paradox ] ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=occupy-wall-street-psychology ) raring its ugly head ?

   medvedev : russia does not like baltic nato membership me : i do n't like a lot of what russia does either - so what now ? 
  if you become more passive-aggressive butthurt now , i would think your name is obama . 
   people begging has n't existed in oslo ? 
  say what now ? 
  i lived in oslo for 20 years , of course there was begging but not in the amount seen . 
  i do n't * blame * anybody - i am just saying it is not acceptable . 
  this time it happened to be lithuania - should we not mention it because of that fact or ? 
  in general , i am a big fan of the baltic states , they have all done so many `` right '' things after the break up of the soviet union and i just want them to continue down that path . 
  oh an in case you wonder , i upvoted your comment . 
  and that is exactly why i see what i see . 
  my family also had one of norway 's worst fascists and torturer , [ henry rinnan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_oliver_rinnan ) , the leader of [ sonderabteilung lola ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sonderabteilung_lola ) and my mum was a nazi whore it turns out , had a child with a german soldier btw . 
  yes , my family has suffered from fascism so do n't give me that bullshit . 
  your nation is heading straight toward fascism and you love it !, 
  somebody got to stand up against us fascism and who better than a country with a deep traumatic past in regards to fascism ? 
  go germany !, 
  it 's part of the schengen agreement and have a say in this . 
  not that i blame the opposition , the roma problem is starting to increase in norway . 
  all of a sudden having heaps of poor people begging and stealing and living in abject slum , something that has never existed even in the capital , makes the people take notice and become upset . 
  it is not norway 's job to feed and house these groups of people . 
  that is the task of their countries so yes , i can understand the irritation over these criminals . 
  true - i recognized myself in many places such as raadhuspladsen and nyhavn . 
  there is another great series called `` the thirties in color '' which i recommend for those so inclined . 
  np , my pleasure !, 
  i noticed them when i watched the video `` train driver 's view : malm\u00f6 to helsing\u00f8r '' and thought it was the coolest thing . 
  see the video i posted in another comment here . 
  i know right ? 
  i often use these as toke-videos to chill with . 
  search for `` train cab copilot '' and you 'll find a lot of amazing ones . 
  one of my absolute favorites , although a bit more vigorous , is [ sydney cab ride central - blacktown ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--qpmcqxzx4 ),

  ok , i get it !, 
  usa is wetter , whether the real data supports it or not . 
  bergen , norway : 2,250 mm also [ see this map of annual precipitation in europe ] ( http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/average-annual-precipitation/map_5_1_annual_precip.eps/image_original ) edit : [ precipitation in switzerland ] ( http://www.currentresults.com/weather/switzerland/average-yearly-precipitation.php ) [ and in ireland ] ( http://www.met.ie/climate/images/climate_rainfallmap.gif ),

  have you seen the size of an average american ? 
  well . . you are doing a great job to hide as a dutch to the quick eye . 
  maybe / r/vexillology would be an appropriate sub-reddit for the newspaper ? 
  no , i was making something we adults like to call ' a joke ' . 
  if the concept is unknown to you , i suggest trying to look it up !, 
   cough you need to see a doctor ... oh that 's right !, 
  you do n't have a uhc system !, 
  aftenposten is norway 's oldest and largest conservative newspaper , in general , it is seen as a tool for the conservative party . 
  on the content ... must see the numbers first . 
  on the comments ? 
  what i 'd expect from frp fans and the more right wing groups , small as they are , have some vocal members . 
  this is correct !, 
  [ apricot computers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apricot_computers ) had probably what was the best pc design and technology i have seen on the pc front . 
  and then you had the [ bbc micro ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bbc_micro ) . 
  siemens , olivetti and several others also produced pc 's . 
  european manufacturers were much more successful in the mini-machine market than the pc market . 
  alas , you are wrong , my friend , see [ cpu bugs , cpu backdoors and consequences on security ] ( http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2f978-3-540-88313-5_37 ), 
  and the result of this is glaringly obvious for anyone to see . 
  americans may have the latest gadget but 1/6th of the population is living in poverty , tens of millions are without easy and cheap access to health care , infrastructure sucks and is crumbling , the education system sucks , the justice system is a joke . 
  maybe you should take a note ? 
  because of issues like : [ nasa 's metric confusion caused mars orbiter loss ] ( http://www.cnn.com/tech/space/9909/30/mars.metric/ ) your system sucks , it is confusing and overly complicated while the metric system is poetic simplicity !,

   was n't windows 95 basically an improved os/2 ? 
  nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo !, 
  hell no !, 
  so far away from that that i do not even know where this idea comes from !, 
  os/2 and windows nt shares a lot of intrinsics as it 's chief developer was the same guy . 
  you can run windows nt programs under os/2 . 
   it 's going to cost companies a lot of money to up and change architectures . 
  not necessarily !, 
  it depends on what they are doing , for most companies , there is actual saving involved rather than cost . 
   this is n't exclusively an issue with microsoft and unfortunately they are obliged to comply with fisa rulings . 
  correct !, 
  this is a problem with us companies not ms specifically . 
  well , i have used linux as my main os since 1995 and use it every day for work and private stuff . 
  the last windows version i had on any machine , was windows 95 and i can tell you , i have not missed ms products one single day !, 
  i have never been a fan of neither ms nor apple but then again , i have followed these companies from the start onward . 
  i loved os/2 from ibm , was part of their beta testing team and it was light years ahead of windows but alas , ibm never got it to become a seller and i 'm sure it would have had spyware today anyway so ...
