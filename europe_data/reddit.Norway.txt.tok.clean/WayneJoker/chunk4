  oxford : blackwell publishing , 1992 * many linguists have tried to link albanian with illyrian , but without clear results . 
  albanian belongs to the satem group within indo-european language tree , while there is a debate whether illyrian was centum or satem . 
  on the other hand , dacian and thracian seem to belong to satem .

  - the cambridge ancient history by john boederman , 2002 , page 848 * according to georgiev , although some albanian toponyms descend from illyrian , illyrian toponyms from antiquity have not changed according to the usual phonetic laws applying to the evolution of albanian . 
  furthermore , placenames can be a special case and the albanian language more generally has not been proven to be of illyrian stock .

  and on the subject of illyrian traces in other peoples : * `` it is now generally agreed that the people who lived in the balkans after the slavic `` invasions '' were probably for the most part the same as those who had lived there earlier , although the creation of new political groups and arrival of small immigrants caused people to look at themselves as distinct from their neighbours , including the byzantines '' .

  pg 169 _______________________________________________________________ there you go . 
  you wanted counter-arguments . 
  also , sources please ? 
  two things : 1 . 
  illyrians vanished as a people over 1000 years ago . 
  if any trace exist among people today of illyrian ancestry , i 'm willing to bet it 's not just limited to albanians , considering the illyrians mixed and were assimilated by those people who came after or who already lived there ( slavs , greeks , bulgars , romans/latins etc ) . 
  so i 'm sorry to disappoint you and your delusions , but you people do not have the right to claim an ancient people and culture who have been gone for over a thousand years , just because you 're butthurt over greeks/serbs/macedonians and want to feel special . 
  and your point is ? 
  that you are illyrians ? 
  is n't katie melua from georgia ? 
  huh , never considered it . 
  i like reading books , but i may give that a try . 
  yes it is . 
  currently reading assassins 's creed : the secret crusade . 
  i 'm a big ac fan , and i love stories set in the middle ages . 
  before that i finished reading a historic book by john fine about the bosnian church , which is a subject i find incredibly interesting . 
  as well as the gunslinger by stephen king . 
  i began reading the iliad by homer , but since i 've never really read such poetry , i had trouble understanding a lot of it , so i put it on hold for now . 
  next on my list , after finishing assassin 's creed , is either war and peace by leo tolstoy , or neuromancer by william gibson . 
  holy shit that 's depressing, 
  is there somewhere i can see the results from the last census ? 
  according to the one from 2000 it 's more or less 50/50 muslims and christians . 
  i 've seen old pictures taken in bosnia during austria hungary , and there are a few where women are completely covered , whether it 's burka or niqab i do n't know . 
  so there definitively were covered woman , but i guess during ah and yugoslavia more and more woman opted to not wear them . 
  example : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:mostar_mahomedan_woman_herzegowina_austro-hungary.jpg, 
  i feel good knowing that there are people in the world who dedicate much of their time to help certain species from becoming extinct . 
  to me , the preservation of animal life , and nature , should become something all nations should work for . 
  why ? 
  we 're a european folk , in a european country . 
  i 'm sure most people in bosnia would rather join the european scene and work their way up to become a well-developed , prosperous european country . 
  why go to a country that has laws against criticizing the president and/or `` turkishness '' . . ? 
  the last thing we need is more influence from you guys . 
  so , i 'm very curious to hear what your reasoning is . . 
  hopefully the country will join sometime in the near future , and i hope this will inspire or lead to change in a lot of things in bosnia . 
  you fuck shit up more than you fix them . 
  source : those 500 years of ottoman cruelty and oppression . . 
   were you under the impression that a bunch of wahabi arabs decided to move to the middle of bosnia for some reason ? 
  they came during the war , and some of them stay i would guess , continuing to spread this shit . 
   but it 's a free country so as long as they do n't try to pull some caliphate shit here there is n't much we can do about them . 
  these sick fucks are fucking jerking off to this idea . 
  it would be a dream come true for them to live in the caliphate . 
  how the hell did they manage to create such a foothold in the country ? 
  how many of them showed up ? 
  and were n't most/all of the sent back right after the war . 
  they should never have come to bosnia . 
  they only know how to spread poison wherever they go ... 
  well , at least bosnians got that coast they always wanted . 
  beautiful picture , i especially like the first one . 
  pretty powerful with karadjorde in the forefront and the cathedral in the background . 
   muslim majority actually , half the country is christian . 
   pave the way for the revival of the turkey/idea of europe . 
  it 's a shame people think that . 
  i consider bosnia to be european , while turkey is not , despite eastern/turkish thrace . 
  yea i 'm done with this . 
  you 're obviously not interested in having a discussion . 
  also , i do n't see how i 'm being arrogant . 
  i even apologized for assuming wrong . 
  you 're apparently more interested in arguing . 
  way to go swiss cheese !, 
  he never should have become the leader of anything . 
  a more secular one would have been the better option . 
  illuminated manuscripts are some of the coolest , and most beautiful artworks in the world . 
  three reasons : 1 . 
  the war . 
  alija ` the islamist ' izetbegovic fired everyone up with some new islamic renewal . 
  his bastard is keeping to this same ideology . 
  saudis dangling piles of cash in front of people to lure them to wahabism . 
  financing the building of new and larger mosques , filled with their own chosen preachers . 
  turkish influence . 
  turkey has been a major player in bosnian politics , always backing up the bosniak muslim side . 
  their nationalism and ottoman-pride has spread into bosnia with many muslims exhibiting fierce loyalty to turks . 
  erdogan is especially popular . 
  islam has is seen as the binding element here . 
  wait , you can change the name of a country ? 
  why of why has n't someone changed bosnia and herzegovina to just bosnia ? 
  much easier . 
  erdogan can erdogag on my balls . 
  shameful . 
  a war criminal walks free . 
  how ` bout you stop trying to control others peoples health and sex life , ok ? 
  jesus , are these people sociopaths or just very apathetic ? 
  interesting, 
  what claim ? 
  heh , my ancestors were n't norse barbarians , but sure let 's battle some frost giants ( snow men ) . 
  yeah , the old slavs are an interesting subject . 
  more information about the lives of these tribes would be incredible . 
  unfortunately , these tribes did not develop a literary language , but stuck with oral tradition . 
  always happy to introduce fascinating historical articles to new people !,
