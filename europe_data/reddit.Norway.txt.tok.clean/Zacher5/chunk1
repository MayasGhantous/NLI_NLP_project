trophy wife, 
  `` sign up for cia today ! '', 
  always good to have a plan b. 
  if the eu collapses , lets make a nordic + baltic federation . 
  and czechout, 
  eea is not part of cap . 
  paying membership dues and having our regulations written in brussels without having a vote on them is the price we pay for having general access to the single market , while being allowed to put up tariffs on foodstuffs and subsidize inefficient farmers more than the eu . 
  whether we 're in the eu or eea also makes no difference on immigration . 
  taiping rebellion led by christians . 
  jesus was a jew . 
  taiping rebellion jewplot 1800 years in the making . 
  eu camps do n't have to be in turkey . 
  they could be on eu soil or in e.g. 
  libya . 
  so , what exactly is the problem ? 
  they do have a backup . 
  it 's called england . 
  so they want to annex andorra ? 
  i 'm okay with this . 
  was there one on here too ? 
  i only saw it on r/geopolitics, 
  well , the uk for instance has [ deep-fried mars bars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deep-fried_mars_bar ), 
   will the french kill you ? 
  yes . 
  350 million drachma , that 'll be almost half a billion zimbabwe dollars !, 
  wow !, 
  twice https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1972 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_european_union_membership_referendum,_1994 ninja edit : four times , actually . 
  forgot that france veto 'd the first two . 
  * implode and head north, 
  eh , they 're not going to invade polen with an aircraft carrier . 
  britain tho . . 
  english , like in nato . 
  this is not a problem in the real world . 
  no but finland is, 
  what 's with the sudden u-turn ? 
  is junker on his period ? 
  thinking about the climate in spain makes me miserable by proxy . 
  how anyone can enjoy that heat i 'll never know . 
  15c or colder is ideal . 
  electric heating/heat pumps are the standard here . 
  source ? 
  at least we 're not simply grey this time . 
  natural uranium is a mix of ~ 0.7 % u-235 and ~ 99.3 % u-238 . 
  u-235 is fissile and is the stuff `` conventional '' reactors can use . 
  u-238 is not fissile , but it can absorb a neutron ( to become u-239 ) , then decay into pu-239 , which is fissile . 
  fast-breeder reactors can produce pu-239 faster than they consume it , so they can tap into the energy reserves of the 99 % of mined uranium which currently goes unused ( and makes up most our spent nuclear fuel ) . 
  i do n't know , i think i 'd see that as a major benefit . 
  mena climate is insufferable imo . 
  what did the reporter do and what is he accused of ? 
  neither is switzerland . 
  and romania is . 
  ... they 'd starve, 
  nothing ? 
  it 's fine as a de facto nature reserve right now . 
  nah they 're pretty good, 
  trillion *, 
  zog is that you ? 
  it is n't . 
   parenting is really expensive yes , this is true , but . .  single parent for all of eu would be a game changer . 
  this might not be a good idea, 
  you were also `` allied '' with austria and hungary both times, 
  also keep in mind that the uk pays for membership , development funds , and also cap funds . 
  norway pays just as much as any member state for membership and development funds , but we do n't pay into cap because we have our own , separate farm subsidies scheme . 
  that 's why norway 's contributions are lower , despite the higher gdp per capita . 
  just a nitpick : nuclear is not a fossil fuel . 
  there 's two denmarks and germany is missing . 
  53 days `` masticating an animal phallus '', 
  [ the osteh\u00f8vel !,

  even iceland ? 
  label your axes !, 
  it 's the votes of the meps . 
  * official anthem, 
  it goes only slighly east of moscow , so it 's still missing some . 
  nice dog . 
  still looks a bit wierd , better throw in czechia and poland too . 
  there are regional differences , of course , the map just does n't show it because the scale does n't go high enough . 
  why ? 
  or just post it here ? 
  sometimes , yes , but it 's not nearly as bad as r/worldnews, 
  username checks out, 
  that article is about asylum applications , not immigration . 
  but you see that 's a problem for politicians and diplomats , so it 's just `` lack of political will '', 
  neoliberalism is keynesian . 
  i 'm more miffed about not being included in all the cool maps and stats :(, 
  you could say that about any european country . 
  seriously though , what 's the submarine for ? 
   a submarine what, 
   sagrada familia  finished ha , good one, 
  it was a huge net importer of food during the famine . 
  although they could have imported more if not for the corn laws . 
  currently [ 4.70 % ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/measures.jsp?lang=en&amp;simdate=20170707&amp;area=jp&amp;taric=9503002190&amp;langdescr=en ), 
  so more like jessie , beli or kyanna ? 
  if you 're not happy with what you get then do n't buy their products . 
  get your cars and phones from other brands . 
  they 're both competitive markets with perfect substitutes . 
  [ according to this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/measures.jsp?lang=en&amp;simdate=20170706&amp;area=jp&amp;taric=21012020&amp;langdescr=en ) , if i 'm reading it correctly , the current import tariff on tea is 6 % i could n't find any conclusive information on whether that tariff will be removed or not . 
  the eu talks a lot about removing barriers to agricultural exports to japan in this deal , i assume the opposite is true as well .
