yeah , shot some hunting rifle when i was like 14 iirc . 
  pretty fun , wan na try hunting in the future . 
  our pension fond is fucking enormous so yeah i reckon i 'll get some but not sure if it will be as much as people are getting now , adjusted for inflation ofc . 
  eh , i just about never see that brand so idk what 's that all about . 
  finnmark and svalbard . 
  i would n't be totally against living in the north if it 's not that far from a 7-8k + city . 
  my middle school had one, 
  i think so, 
  yeah of course . 
  not defending it , the road administration agency likes to go ham with toll booths on brand new roads . 
  must suck extra much if you have to go through multiple toll booths on your daily commute , must get very expensive in the long run . 
  yeah pretty much . 
   i was going to recommend going to the far north of norway , sweden or finland , but that 's more for the beautiful nature than fine dining and social stuff . 
  you wo n't find a metropolis up there of course it 's not a metropolis but troms\u00f8 is n't too bad , about 75k population . 
  brilliant place to spot the northern lights and it 's a relatively good sized city for arctic circle standards . 
  a city around the size where you got pretty much everything you need , heard many people that have loved living there . 
  it 's fucked up , kids being brough up in labour camps and living there to the day they die , watching their parents die in the meantime and the 3rd generation punishment system is abseloutley terrible . 
  i wish something could be done to save these people but when the big powers refuse to cooperate it makes things pretty difficult . 
  as long as you do n't commit crimes you should be fine going there . 
  they 're letting in more and more western tourists every year and it 's quite rare that they imprison tourists . 
  there are n't many highways in general . 
  usually just outside some of the biggest southern cities . 
  they 're narrow , curvy and the speed limit is often just 90-100 . 
  we have a few highways with 110 as the limit , however that 's not many . 
  suppegj\u00f8k - soup cuckoo might sound really weird but this is a swear word in norwegian , and a criminally underused one . 
  definitely one of my favourites . 
  visited 17 countries to date , not too bad for a 18 year old i think liked the most : japan . 
  my 17/yo birthday present was to pick any destination in the world within a certain budget to go to . 
  picked tokyo and it was really interesting . 
  my favourite mainly down to just how different it was from anything i 've ever experienced in europe . 
  interesting history , culture and a beautiful country with great people . 
  liked the least : eh dunno , maybe finland . 
  was n't terrible or anything but probably one of the lesser interesting places i 've been to . 
  basically just a more boring version of sweden but i must say i did n't really do a lot while i was there and the weather was pretty shitty so it did n't really help . 
  ssx on tour was so fun , forgot about that game . 
  definitely one of my favourite ps2 games . 
  ** nintendo 64 ** * super mario 64 * f-zero x ** ps2 ** * crash bandicoot : twinsanity * tony hawk 's pro skater 3 ** ps3 ** * fifa 12 ( best ever fifa game imo ) * far cry 3 * battlefield : bad company 2 * gta 4 * red dead redemption * skate 3 * need for speed : shift ** ps4 ** * gta 5 ** pc ** * runescape * tribalwars ( browser mmorts game , dead now i think but used to be the shit ) * civilization v * counter-strike : global offensive * just cause 2, 
  the backsides are a bit different to the ones in the picture . 
  the 200 note is [ like this ] ( http://www.norges-bank.no/globalassets/upload/sedler-og-mynter/images/sedler/utgave-viii/200back_viii_specimen.jpg ) . 
  less pixelated and better colour choice . 
  agree its not the best backside but the frontsides make up for it imo . 
  they 're really nice imo , could have been a lot worse . 
  the 500kr note is just beautiful , only 100 and 200 released so far though . 
  yeah people love to criticize low-cost airlines but you get exactly what you 're paying for . 
  a seat and no more , if you expect some fancy ass spacious seat with free drinks you 've chosen the wrong airline . 
  i like low-cost airlines because they offer the cheapest flights possible and no more . 
  i want to live abroad one day , not sure if it will happen though . 
  requires a lot of planning and dedication and it 's not like i dislike living here or anything . 
  most likely will just end up studying a year abroad as an exchange student if i do end up emigrating but i would n't mind staying abroad for a bit longer . 
  however i do n't want to leave the country for good . 
  if i 'm ever emigrating i 'll probably end up coming home within 5 years as i do like living here . 
  father had 1 , mother 2 . 
  i 'd personally want 1-2 kids in the future . 
  erm . 
  never heard that myself . 
  maybe a company you 've had bad experiences with but it 's hardly a widely shared opinion i think . 
  how was kamchatka ? 
  seems pretty remote but heard it 's very beautiful . 
  we do n't have to follow every eu rule/regulation . 
  most yes but we get a pass on certain areas which are extremeley important to norway . 
  fishery being one of them , if we were to join the eu we would give up most of our fishing rights to the eu and ships could come from other countries and fish in our territory . 
  we want to keep this for ourselves as fishery is quite important to us . 
  the few areas we get a pass on are enouh to make us overall benefit from the deal . 
  and if we actually were to join how much of a say would realistically a country of 5 million people get ? 
  not much . 
  to be fair while it does sound like a bad deal we most definitely benefit more from it than we would if we did n't have the deal . 
  no do n't actually have them . 
  i think we 're one of the few countries in europe that does n't have one because i believe we wanted to make our own fancy thing instead of following what most countries use or something . 
  that 's why it has taken so long , apparently gon na come next year though . 
  i like meny , good quality stuff but only seem to find them in cities . 
  yeah , i 've played football for like 13 years now , and still playing . 
  currently in my last season for the u19 team of my local club . 
  when i was little my dream was always to become a pro but i got a pretty bad injury when i was 12 that fucked up my legs . 
  i was n't too bad to be honest , most likely never would have become a pro regardless of the injury but would have been interesting to see how far i could come if i did n't get that injury . 
  still have it to this day which limits how much football i can play . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're trying to pull a joke i do n't get but i 'm talking about alanya , turkey if it was confusing :p, 
  magaluf , ayia napa , rhodes , alanya for partying, 
  because unless you live in the uk or ireland you 'll have a hard time getting by only with your native language if you want to travel abroad or understand the world around you better . 
  learning a 3rd language in school is often a waste of time imo , people rarely learn the language to a good enough level that they will be able to speak it once they 're done in school . 
  but learning english besides your native language is crucial . 
  you were offered chinese in high school ? 
  yeah but being part of the oslo region does n't mean you 're a part of oslo . 
  i apparently live in the `` oslo region '' despite my municipality being nothing like oslo and we do n't consider ourselves a part of it , even drammen is in the oslo region . 
  i agree you can totally put asker/b \u00e6rum under oslo though which is why i said it was kinda cheating but just included it either way . 
  most of the funding comes from a mandatory annual license fee , pretty much if you own a tv you have to pay the fee . 
  it 's about 3000 nok ( $ 320 ) . 
  they have a few other channels as well in addition to a dozen or so radio channels . 
  do n't think they 're that common . 
  only know 1 guy that has one . 
  snus is the alternative to smoking here and it still seems like people prefer that . 
  no idea if vape shops exist . 
  huh ? 
  what has that got to do with it ? 
  could n't find any numbers but assume it 's something like this . 
  by participation in a sports club 1 . 
  football 2 . 
  handball 3 . 
  cross country skiing, 
  city of stavanger and its surroundings is pretty rich due to it being the hub of the oil industry . 
  b\u00e6rum municipality is the richest in the country , it 's located slightly outside oslo in the west .
