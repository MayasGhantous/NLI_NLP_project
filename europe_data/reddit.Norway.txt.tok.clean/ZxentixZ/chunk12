  because clash of ideologies and ideas compared to the east . 
  it 's pretty obvious that when the soviet union was created on the bases of communist rule and economic structure they were never going to get along well with a much more capitalist/demoratic west with the us and the uk in the lead . 
  right before the soviet union was created this was also a time where the us and uk really started proper collaboration and experienced belief in the same ideologies and thoughts . 
  during the cold war the hatred between soviet and the west escalated and this is what has set the foundation of todays relationship . 
  nato was created after the ww2 as a ** western ** military alliance and when soviet collapsed they had lost a lot of land and it became worse when the baltic states joined nato , which was previously their territory . 
  also do n't think the creation of the european union helped much either . 
  this has moved the `` west '' closer in on russia 's territory , today only belarus and ukraine are seperating the eu and russia . 
  i could understand russia in a sense , they obviously feel threatened and they have two huge western alliances closing in on them . 
  this was very much the reason why russia even invaded crimea in the first place , they wanted to keep the `` west '' near them and have a `` buffer zone '' in between . 
  they obviously feel threatened , in the same way the west feels threatened by russia . 
  most parts of new york are probably just like normal cities , only very certain touristy area will be over populated and `` hectic '' . 
  i 've lived my whole life in a small town with 2.500 people and i went to tokyo last year . 
  was n't really hectic at all apart from a very few famous areas . 
  apart from like broadway and some other areas most of new york will probably be reasonably alright in terms of volume of people . 
  i 'd love to visit new york personally , a lot of famous landmarks and the whole atmosphere seems interesting . 
  i think it would be a cool visit and i 'm hoping to go there one day . 
  american road trip is definitely on my bucket list . 
  hoping to do that one day , would be a interesting experience . 
  i like driving for long distances but that would be long even for me . 
  still wan na do it though, 
  as a cs : go player this made me sad lol :(, 
  probably what where gon na live off after the oil is empty . 
  it 's mainly what has made us rich and we honestly do n't really have that many good alternatives to it . 
  that combined with poor integration of immigrants . 
  we take in quite a lot of refugees and immigrants from poor countries every year but many of them are not getting integrated into society and live off social benefits . 
  this will hurt our country and economy long term and is why we should take in less in my opinion . 
  many experts are predicting our oil fund ( worth over $ 800 billion ) will be gone in 50-60 years time so it will be nothing left for the current youth . 
  this is very much threatened by all the money we spend on people who do n't contribute . 
  for the most part , yes, 
  they 're definitely quite popular . 
  anyone who follows winter sports know kjetil jansrud and aksel lund svindal . 
  svindal is the most famous , won a lot of races and is one of our most famous winter sport athletes . 
  jansrud is the better skier currently and is defintely also quite famous , albeit not as famous as svindal . 
  most people know who they are but they 're not as famous as lets say alpine skiers in austria i believe . 
  sort of difficult to rank . 
  probably [ marit bj\u00f8rgen ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/marit_bj%c3%b8rgen ) ( female cross country skier ) . 
  got 6 olympic gold medals and 18 gold medals from world champonsship . 
  only a few weeks ago she won 4 out of 6 gold medals in the 2017 championship . 
  easily the best in the world at what she does [ petter northug ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/petter_northug ) is also very popular as a male cross country skier but he has had really bad results the last couple of years and he is somewhat controversial . 
  a few years back he was probably the most popular norwegian athlete , known for mocking the swedes and beating them in finishes . 
  loved by norwegians but hated by the swedes if you count him as an athlete [ magnus carlsen ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/magnus_carlsen ) would be up there as well . 
  best chess player in the world but i would n't put him as a sport athlete myself . 
  very very rarely . 
  ca n't remember the last time . 
  probably 1 + year ago . 
  i live in a rural town where you never see the military . 
  the closest base is like an hour away but they mostly stay inside the base which you ca n't really spot unless you 're in there . 
  i might have seen like a jeep within a year which i ca n't remember but nothing more, 
  you could make some fancy maps using some other software but i 'm not very experienced so paint works fine, 
  yeah it 's pretty ridiculous . 
  even if you have straight a 's from high school in many instances that 's not even enough . 
  you often need straight a 's in addition to extra points gained from chosing specific subjects etc. 
  yeah , my comment was obviously mostly stereotypical things which is how i guess a lot of people look at tr\u00f8ndelag . 
  it 's the same with '' \u00d8stlandet '' really . 
  i come from a small town an hour from oslo , we 're really nothing like them and speak quite differently but whenever i 'm in other parts of the country i 'm always `` that guy from oslo '' even though we 're very different . 
  the endless flat farmlands is what i know tr\u00f8ndelag for , do n't know much about the area at all . 
  driven through there a few times but not stayed there for more than a day at a time . 
  definitely the region i know the least about, 
  it 's your choice of course but it 's still a little strange in my opinion . 
  i would n't do it but if it makes you more comfortable go for it i guess . 
  it 's still quite unlikely you will face any major discrimination here though, 
  i 'd keep it . 
  no offense or anything but i find it a tad strange when a foreigner who does n't even speak the language ( i assume ? ), 
  switch to a very typical norwegian name . 
  it just comes across as a bit fake , people will still see that you 're not ethnically norwegian . 
  it 's unlikely you will face any major problems or discrimination , most of the racist people wo n't have the balls to be racist or show their ideology to you personally . 
  you should be fine with your current name . 
  can confirm , great idea !, 
  found a empty version of the map and then just filled in colours using paint . 
  we have 5 regions , these are some extremeley stereotypical descriptions of each area but most have some truth to them ** s\u00f8rlandet ( southern norway ) : ** very maritime , most people live near the coast and experience good temperatures in the summer . 
  also the bible belt of norway , lot of christians here . 
  they talk somewhat similar to danes and share more similarities with denmark than the rest of norway . 
  consists of a lot of archipelagos and a bit more hilly terrain inland . 
  ** vestlandet ( western norway ) : ** bunch of different people with their own distinct dialect that believe they 're different and better than their neighbours . 
  most of the most beautiful fjords and mountain areas are located here . 
  quite a lot of rich people live there due to the oil business being based there . 
  also rains a shit ton ** \u00d8stlandet ( eastern norway ) : ** western part is mountainous while the rest is quite flat and filled with farms and decently sized towns and cities . 
  most people live in and around oslo . 
  where most political stuff happens and people from all across the country hate the people living here . 
  most of the immigrants in norway also live in the oslo region . 
  people from outside of oslo look at them as very self-centered ** tr\u00f8nderlag ( central norway ) : ** dont really know much about this part but it seems sort of like the texas of norway , distinct people from the rest of norway with their own weird accent , they also seem to be pretty proud of their homeplace . 
  quite flat with a lot of farmland . 
  they 're also quite cocky ( not sterotypical at all lol ) ** nord-norge ( northern norway ) : ** beautiful region with tall mountains and nice scenery . 
  sort of more crazy version of the central norwegians . 
  people swear in every sentence , drink a ton and are crazy in general . 
  personally i love this part of norway . 
  they sort of live without rules and do what they want , very liberal place in terms of how they live from my experience, 
  not sure yet but i know for a fact i will not vote for a social democratic party . 
  most likely i 'll vote either h\u00f8yre ( conservative party ) or venstre ( liberal party ) , in norway they 're quite similar , center to centre right . 
  22 of july 2011 attacks by anders behring breivik . 
  first bombing the government offices killing 8 people and then shooting and killing 69 people at a political youth camp , which as the name suggests consisted mainly of very young people . 
  it was just examples , i do n't really know a lot of the differences between the northern states . 
  montana , wisconsin etc would probably be nice aswell . 
  i just listed some of the northern states for example purposes . 
  the north would be preferable because of the climate and the people seem to be more down to earth than in the south east . 
  reason i used minnesota as an example was probably just because it 's kinda known to be the `` norwegian state '' over here lol, 
  canada , new zealand , australia or us ( certain parts , like washington , oregon , n/s dakota , minnesota or perhaps new england ) i do n't mind the us as much as many other people on this sub but from what i 've heard the working culture does n't seem too great . 
  i 've heard that a lot of people in the us are scared of taking holidays and just end up working the whole year around without much time off . 
  this would be horrible for me as i appreciate having time off work, 
  it 's not that important .
