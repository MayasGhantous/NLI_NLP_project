  exact same thing here . 
  feel like that is sort of how people feel about their capital in most european countries tbh . 
  runescape was a huge factor in me learning english . 
  of course we started learning it in 2th-3rd ? 
  grade but the internet definitely was what i learnt the most from . 
  runescape was the first online video game i started playing in the mid 2000 's that required me to learn english . 
  learnt so many new words and it helped a lot having to communicate with other players . 
  then you had the start of youtube which further developed my understanding of the language . 
  this on top of the english lessons at school was what helped me the most . 
  it very much depends on the person and his/hers age . 
  kids that come here before they 're 15 usually learn fluent norwegian quite quickly . 
  in elementary school we had this russian kid who learnt fluent norwegian in like 3-4 months , seriously better than native kids . 
  it was ridiculous . 
  but most kids are usually pretty fluent in a few years maximum . 
  it 's usually 20 year olds and up that struggles , many adults who come here as refugees/immigrants often have big problems learning the language and many do n't even learn it after 5 + years . 
  it 's a pretty big problem in the integration process because it makes it very difficult for them to get a job and be a contributing factor in the society in general . 
  in my town we have a lot of burmese families , the kids speak norwegian well while the parents still have n't learned it after years . 
  pronunciation is what most foreigners struggle with , a lot learn plenty of words and vocabulary but they often struggle having a good flow and pronouncing correctly . 
  sounds like `` kj '' sj '' are especially difficult because in many other languages they 're not really used , even some native speakers struggle with those sounds . 
  yeah that 's actually a nice song , but it 's far too football centric . 
  would have to make it more neutral . 
  suprised snus is n't more used than only 9 % on a daily basis . 
  however it is increasing compared to smokers, 
  tbh i did n't even know estonian was non indo-european until now . 
  not really a coffee person yet , will probably end up drinking it later though . 
  right now i usually opt for a glass of ice tea in the morning . 
  sami is pretty cool, 
  well sami is non indo european and recognized in both norway and sweden . 
  bet you 've had some experiences of it as well ? 
  at least in norway we have it on the television quite frequently . 
  well it 's illegal so i guess you get a hefty fine, 
  we 've honestly stepped up a bit recently but most of what is produced is still quite poor . 
  however lilyhammer and nobel are both good tv series that we 've produced somewhat recently . 
  i do n't watch skam myself but it has recived stupidly good reviews for such a low budget series . 
  `` kongens nei '' or `` the king 's choice '' in english is a movie that came out late last year and also got good reviews . 
  i think some of the new stuff that is getting produced definitely is good and an improvement over previous years but the average quality is still not good enough and way below denmark as you mentioned . 
  in terms of content ? 
  it 's a pretty decent channel , even though they 're state owned and all that they 're very independent and really do whatever they like . 
  i guess they 're somewhat similar to the bbc in the uk . 
  they have news , tv shows/series , entertainment and certain sporting events . 
  it 's the biggest tv channel alongside tv2 which is quite similar , they each have their own tv series that they make and compete against each other for the most viewers . 
  there are only 4 nrk channels in total . 
  nrk2 is for local news and lesser popular tv series , nrk3 for even more series and shows and nrk super is a childen 's channel . 
  some of the shows are pretty interesting and of good quality , i definitely do like nrk, 
  free tv does n't exist . 
  if you have a television and get signals in on it you must pay a tv-license that all goes to the state owned channel nrk . 
  it 's about 3000nok / $ 330 every year . 
  the only thing you get for that is the nrk tv channel and a few other subchannels that are connected to it . 
  it 's been debated quite a bit and if i 'm not wrong it might actually be gone soon, 
  like all movies i 've ever watched bar 1 % of them who are norwegian . 
  norwegian movies generally do suck but whenever one comes out and gets good reviews i might watch it , but that is n't too often so like 99 % of the movies i watch are foreign, 
  for me ** ursk\u00e6ving ** - someone from the very small town outside of oslo that i 'm from . 
  ** \u00d8stlending ** - someone from eastern norway , however i do n't really feel very connected to this part ** norsk ** - someone from norway ** skandinavisk ** - someone from scandinavia ** nordisk ** - someone from the nordic countries ** europeer ** - someone from europe, 
  no offense but there are so many cities of that description in the uk , scunthorpe , hull , milton keynes , luton , wycombe , stoke etc , so many more i could name aswell . 
  we also had a lot of snow ball fights , i believe it got prohibited though when people started adding stones and ice into the snow balls and throwing them , some people actually got seriously hurt and one guy even got blind at some other school . 
  remeber it was taken very seriously and every teacher had to explain to their class how dangerous it was and that it was n't allowed with normal snow balls anymore . 
  in the summer : ** football ** - definitely what we did at our school the most as kids . 
  [ these ] ( http://www.fjt.no/frapapir/article12017485.ece/2rengc/alternates/w980-default/20spo060919hf101.jpg ) are quite common in norway at elementary schools and they 're nice to play football in . 
  in the winter : ** king of the hill ** - my school had a somewhat large and wide hill that we used to climb on top of and play king of the hill . 
  it was usually two years against each other , like year 6 against year 7 for instance . 
  the oldest usually won and it could get a bit violent . 
  it was basically a mini war of trying to throw someone from the other year down from the hill and then `` capturing '' it . 
  it was usually only played in the winter though because less people would get hurt and it was more suitable in general . 
  it was really the perfect game to give someone you did n't like some beating because it was accepted by the people participating that most things was allowed . 
  there were however some instances of kids getting hurt , the teachers were n't always too happy with it . 
  what on earth is that `` opplanda '' dialect , honestly could n't get more than a few words out of that . 
  this [ tr\u00f8nder ] ( https://youtu.be/62xgnx0oy-q?t=17s ) dialect is also incredibly difficult to understand and it 's also quite funny imo, 
  northern norway is massively underrated by southernes . 
  having grown up in southern norway but with family up north i 've been in lofoten and northern norway in general many times and seen the incredible scenery . 
  it 's amazing and definitely a must see if you go here . 
  foreign tourists also tend to prefer the fjords and western norway , while that 's also very beautiful northern norway is just as worth visiting , especially lofoten . 
  some foreign tourists go there but many people from southern norway have never been up north , which is totally something everyone should do . 
  football is the biggest sport and after that it 's mainly winter sports . 
  cross country skiing , biathlon , ski jumping , downhill skiing etc. 
  handball is also big in certain areas and cities . 
  where i come from for instance it was almost 50-50 between football and handball, 
  yeah i 've got some stick from him aswell by pm . 
  he called me a cunt for writing `` favorite '' instead of `` favourite '' lol edit : here it is https://gyazo.com/2b5a2a408137fc437364c1845d06ac8b, 
  the monarchy is accepted here as the way it `` should '' be and most people are completley fine with it . 
  i very rarely hear people that want to abolish the monarchy and start a republic . 
  norwegians first settled in iceland and they used to be a part of our country so they have significance in our history . 
  j\u00e4mtland and h\u00e4rjedalen ( two swedish provinces ) used to be a part of us for over 450 years , from the 12th to 17th century . 
  bohusl\u00e4n was a part of us from the 11th to 17th century . 
  they were n't vital to our existence or anything but they were certainly important and big areas to have control over . 
  it 's from 1814 after we got independence ( sort of ) from denmark . 
  we got in a union with sweden the same year but we got to keep the constitution apart from some small adjustments that were made . 
  at the time it was regarded as one of the most modern and democratic constitutions in all of europe . 
  made people stand more together and created a stronger bond between the regular citizen . 
  everyone came together to show support against extremism, 
  mabye breivik 's terror attacks in 2011 ? 
  totally unexpected event which shocked the world and us especially . 
  we never thought anything like that could happen here and it did , everyone was in shock and it was a difficult period . 
  we had no idea how to respond or how to recover . 
  when 1 single teenager here is killed , for whatever reason , most newspapers will write about it and it will be a fairly big case . 
  imagine when 77 people ( mostly very young ) are shot and killed all at once . 
  it was truly a gruesome period for the whole country . 
  live about in the middle of oslo and the swedish border . 
  not been properly cold for a good while . 
  it 's floating around 0 degrees and has been like that the last week or so . 
  it snowed a lot yesterday which was nice , probably the most i 've seen this winter and it 's still laying on the ground .
