  but almost gets a bit boring when driving for long distances without many stops . 
  i do n't mind manual and the first car i buy will probably be a manual , seeing as they 're cheaper but automatic is very nice when you 're bound to be stuck in long lines every morning . 
  there is . 
  far more comfortable to drive when ur stuck in traffic . 
  long lines can be really tiring when driving a manual . 
  we say `` krone eller mynt '' meaning `` crown or coin '', 
  i 'm not saying it will happen or anything , i do n't think it will but the possibility is certainly there . 
  they could invade you if they really wanted and it 's difficult to understand russia and their logic . 
  russia do n't give a shit , they just want territory and global power , and seeing as you 're not a memeber of nato you would be one of the few countries they would have a chance of potentialy invading . 
  russia are scared of nato and do n't want new countries joining . 
  that was one of the reasons why they attacked ukraine , to stop them from becoming a memeber . 
  they could potentially attack you if they feel threatend , the general nato/russia border is getting closer and closer . 
  you used to be a part of them aswell so they probably would n't mind having you back , all territory is good territory according to russia . 
  it would also bring them a bit closer west which they would like . 
  wtf is a discover card , you 're talking about hearthstone ? 
  all of them , can do most in the world in general . 
  pretty interested in geography ... 
  yeah thank god for that . 
  i would honestly be scared if i was living in eastern finland or something . 
  we 're also a very close ally with the us so i see it as unlikely russia would try something on us . 
  yeah it 's really scary to think about . 
  we do n't really have a lot of personnel on the border either so if russia really wanted to invade they totally would be able to . 
  we are however a memeber of nato though which makes things a lot more difficult to russia if they wanted to attack , so i do n't think we would be the first country they would invade . 
  the baltics along with possibly finland are more vulnerable, 
  for us , russia . 
  we 're neighbours and they 've clearly shown agression towards us ( and the other nordic countries ) the last few years . 
  they 've done a lot of spying and not far from the border they even had military exercises where they practiced an invasion of northern norway . 
  it does n't mean much , we 're not as crazy about is as americans but it 's definitely very cool and interesting imo to find out where you 're ancestors came from . 
  my grandfather is very much into geneaology and has put a ton of time and effort into it . 
  he has found out we have ancestors 200-300 years back from scotland , hence why my middle name is scottish . 
  i also have ancestors from germany and denmark . 
  it 's very interesting imo but yeah you should n't believe you are from that country or whatever just because your ancestors were , that 's just silly . 
  i like our flag , would n't really want it to change . 
  you could say it 's not very distinct as the whole nordics has a flag with a cross but i guess it 's kinda cool at the same time and puts us all in a little flag group . 
  we 're also not very christian anymore but i do n't really care about the cross part , i see no point in changing it . 
  i usually just fly the cheapest one . 
  sas ( our national flag carrier ) and norwegian ( most popular low-cost ) are the two only i use for domestic flights , which one is cheapest depends on destination and time of year and i always go for the one that is cheapest , not really a huge differnece in the quality between the two so ... 
  i 'd say people just do as they like here , with no real stigma attached to not following certain parts of our culture . 
  for instance people that do n't like skiing are n't frowned upon , if you do n't want to be patriotic and shit talk our country you 're mostly free to do so and if you choose to be very patriotic i would say most people accept that too . 
  though i have n't experienced a lot of super patriotic norwegians . 
  we have a pretty liberal view when it comes to our culture , just do as you like, 
  lol , i always mix up ljubljana and bratislava and can never remember which one is in slovenia and which one is in slovakia . 
  most of them are pretty small though , do n't think i 've ever seen a spider bigger than 3-4cm, 
  ah , was one swede from j\u00e4mtland here , thought it was you lol . 
  that would be cool but a bit weird seeing as you guys speak english while we have our own language . 
  but it certainly would be an interesting country, 
  i 'm going to move in a years time from where i currently live in eastern norway so i would probably live here through 2017 and then move as planned in early 2018 . 
  western sweden is a fairly nice place and very similar to where i live 1 hour from the border so i would n't mind living there for a bit but not for long . 
  i want to stay as a norwegian citizen and live in this country . 
  are n't you the guy from j\u00e4mtland ? 
  that was stolen by sweden to begin with so you better come back and join us :p, 
  cs : go it has kinda destroyed every other game for me . 
  2 + years ago i used to be someone who played a lot of different games from like civ 5 to fifa to fps games but after i got into cs : go 1.5 years ago it 's pretty much the only thing i play , so addictive and competitive . 
  i was seriously considering romania at 3rd . 
  would probably be in my top 6-7 . 
  would like seeing your country one time, 
  ** italy ** - beautiful landscape and nature , interesting cities , culture and history . 
  also love the food , would want to taste the food i eat back home in the way they do in italy . 
  ** iceland ** - also got incredible scenery and i love isolated places like iceland who are quite some way from the rest of europe . 
  it 's also quite interesting seeing as they share a lot of similarities with us , and it would be cool seeing what differences can be found 3 . 
  ** greece ** - love greek food and their history , would like to see some of the ancient stuff that there is to see there . 
  they also got some nice beaches and islands i would love to explore . 
  edit : i would freaking love to visit ** georgia ** aswell , did n't think of the country when i made the list but not sure if it really would count as europe , some people do and some do n't . 
  it would probably get my 3rd place on the list if it 's considered europe . 
  average in norway is 45.000 nok ( $ 5000 ) per month or 540.000 nok ( $ 60.000 ) annual . 
  they seem high , and they are obviously compared to many other countries in europe but we have very high taxes and are one of the most expensive countries in the world so we should have high salaries to compensate for that . 
  i definitely feel some salaries are too low still , for example police officers and firefighters , they are heavily underpayed, 
  bus every day, 
  we are the country where new shit that is going to get built is planned in 2015 probably will be finished in 2027 at best . 
  it 's ridiculous how long certain things take here , especially when it comes to deiciding on certain projects , goals and what not . 
  it takes forever, 
  i live in a small town with only a few thousand residents so we do n't have that many immigrants but we do have some from pakistan and myanmar ( burma ) . 
  the pakistanis at my age who went to my school etc were all very wannabe gangster types , talking with a foreign accent even though they 've lived here their whole life and they were n't all that nice tbh . 
  i 'm not going to say everyone is like this but in oslo aswell the pakistani children / teenagers very often end up like this for some reason . 
  there were however a few families from myanmar who lived in the house straight over the road from me where i grew up , they were quiet but nice people who mostly kept to themselves and did n't communicate much with locals , i grew up with some at my age and they were pretty nice people tbh , never did anything wrong and were generally cool, 
  that guy was just completley fucked in the head was n't he ? 
  killed several of his family members and when he was young he dropped cats and dogs out of the kremlin to watch them die . 
  seems like a pretty insane guy, 
  for me they never really cared , my father comes from northern norway where swearing is basically a part of every day speech so i do n't think he has ever said something about it , and i swear a fair bit and started quite early . 
  my mother has mentioned my swearing a few times but i try not to swear that much around her but once i became 17-18 she did n't even seem to care that much either, 
  fix the `` norwegian '' subject . 
  in high school in norway you get at least 4 grades in norwegian when you graduate ( in most other subjects you only get 1 or 2 grades ) and you can risk getting even more . 
  we have two written standard forms of norwegian here and the one we do n't use we have to learn at school . 
  abseloutley pointless and a waste of time , people can easily understand the other written form but it 's just pointless having to use time and a lot of effort to study the other one . 
  while the vocabulary is pretty similar in the two the grammar is quite different and it 's such a pain the ass having to study and learn the other form . 
  for people like me who grew up hating the norwegian subject it fucked me over getting so many grades in the subject . 
  i also do n't understand why the `` music '' subject exist in secondary school and why `` religion '' exist from elementary to high school . 
  both are pointless and a waste of time, 
  the trust that people have in each other here is something i love . 
  when i was younger i remember my mother taking 3-4 garments from a clothing store home without paying for any of them and letting me try all of them at home and then returning the other ones and pay up later . 
  i come from a fairly small town so stuff like this happened all the time , people just trusted each other and it made for a very nice community . 
  it really makes me appreciate that we have it like that here when looking at other parts of the world where that would never in a million years be possible . 
  ye we have the same thing . 
  love it, 
  viking age is probably the most interesting period of our history . 
  had control over iceland , greenland , faroe islands , shetland islands , orkney islands , islands to the west of scotland etc at one point, 
  no one likes us :(, 
  i know it 's not only used in america or anything but whenever i see a pickup truck i always think of america and the southern region especially . 
  seems very american to me, 
  well according to wikipedia the town/city has 500 residents , and a few shops .
