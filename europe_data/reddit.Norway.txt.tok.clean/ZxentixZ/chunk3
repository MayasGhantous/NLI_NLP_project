  if you 're exactly on the 80 you will get overtaken by just about every car . 
  japan is amazing on so many levels but the work culture just makes it unbearable to choose . 
  i 'd probably go for some western english speaking country as it would be easy to integrate . 
  canada , new zealand and parts of the us would be nice . 
  australia has never really interested me for some reason but i guess it would be an alright place to live . 
  i 've been to japan and loved it but the work culture seems abseloutley awful , would never live there purely because of that reason . 
  shame they 're so far behind on certain issues because it 's such an amazing country expect for those issues , but they ca n't be ignored sadly . 
  they 're all nice blokes , well exepct a certain government of a country that we border in the far north-east . 
  my internet is and has been down the whole day . 
  ended up playing cities : skylines and i 've now sat up until 05:20 ruining my sleep pattern whilst playing that game and totally forgetting the time . 
  rip me, 
  yeah , and my problem is that pretty much my entire family on both sides live on the other side of the country , western and northern norway respectively . 
  literally my mother is my only family member that work inside a 50km radius of where i live . 
  and where she works they do n't need any workers . 
  this sucks because most people around my age get jobs exclusively because of family and other connections , while i do n't have that advantage . 
  i 'll honestly have to go through the standard application process like a normal person, 
  i was accepted there this year but as i 'm going in the military in january i 'll take a couple of years break before further studies . 
  but most likely i will end up there when i 'm done in the military, 
  going in the military in january . 
  basically just waiting until then , should try and find a job until then but i 'm lazy as fuck when it comes to jobseeking . 
  working itself is fine but jobseeking is a pain in the ass , ca n't get myself to write a application . 
  will probably have to apply for some jobs sooner or later though, 
  it does n't taste exactly like paprika but i do n't care since it 's hella good . 
  it 's the same with many things , pretty much anything with strawberry flavour tastes nothing like actual strawberries but some of it is still quite good . 
  bergen is really beautiful and i 've heard its a nice city to live in . 
  great scenery and plenty of possibilities for hikes and other outdoor activites . 
  i 'll probably end up in trondheim in a couple of years time , a city i also do n't mind moving to , heard it 's nice there as well . 
  honestly i just want to live in a city and experience something new , i 've lived in a rural area my whole life ( 2.5 k pop town ) and it 's not the most exciting place to live . 
  1 or 2 will most likely be dictated by my future so 's wishes and our economy . 
  so with all these variables it 's difficult to say for certain yet, 
  could get behind that . 
  paprika crisps is the best flavour . 
  yeah true i guess , i live in that region so did n't include it . 
  h\u00f8yre ( conservative party ) . 
  despite their name they 're not that conservative like other conservative parties in europe . 
  they 're considered one of the more liberal parties we have . 
  i 'd probably vote for venstre ( liberal party ) if it was n't for their naive attitude towards immigration , they basically just want to take everyone in . 
  i do n't agree with h\u00f8yre in everything , not even close but i prefer their stance on immigration and certain other cases so i 'd say them probably . 
  quite partial . 
  they use `` we '' during the game and they do n't hide the fact that they 're supporting the norwegian team . 
  it 's far worse in other sports though , in cycling we have 2 phenomenal but extremeley partial commentators . 
  they 're known for screaming in joy when one of our riders win . 
  eastern inland : thick accent , peasants , slow , isolated south coast : everyone own boats . 
  ( not funny but feels like it 's true ) south-west : christians stavanger/sandnes : rich , bitchy accent bergen : arrogant , very proud of their city fjord people : slow , old , isolated , retro , miser sunnm\u00f8re : miser tr\u00f8ndelag ( central norway ) : arrogant , heavy drinkers , get pissed off easily northern-norway : proud , hates everyone south of bod\u00f8 , inbred , uneducated , they all secretly fuck fish and they drink especially much to forget how shit it is to live up there :d, 
  never, 
  nkp ( norwegian communist party ) there may be some parties i simply have n't heard of that i agree with even less but of the ones i know nkp is my least favorite . 
  they 're not really relevant anymore though with no seats in parliament and county councils . 
  of the somewhat relevant parties probably r\u00f8dt ( red party ) , which is basically communists as well . 
  yeah by european standards at least we 're quite big , 6th biggest country in europe . 
  but compared to the world we 're quite average in terms of area , however not many people live here so it makes us one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world . 
  holy shit your ** least densely ** populated province has a density of 180 / km2 ? 
  i live in the 2nd ** most densely ** county in norway and the density is 107 / km2 , almost half as dense . 
  that 's insane and shows how bloody dense the netherlands is and how sparsley populated we are :p, 
  the northernmost county of finnmark . 
  remote and it seems like there is nothing to do and few people live there . 
  in the winters you also go for months without seeing the sun , depressing stuff . 
  f\u00e5gelturken is pretty awesome though, 
  does airsoft guns count ? 
  i have one that i bought some years back , rifle that literally looks identical to the real thing , weighs the same as well . 
  with no orange tip or other way of telling the difference . 
  so i 'm not sure if there are any rules concerning that . 
  definitely hear similarities with australian english in those videoes you posted . 
  i 'd like to say i hear a general difference but i 'm not completley sure if i would be able to tell them apart in a blind test . 
  in all honesty i 'd probably not be able to tell them much apart with the little new zealand accent i 've actually heard . 
  guess you have to spend more time listening to the accents independently to start hearing the differences . 
  australians and most americans are easy to distinguish from their english counterparts imo . 
  scottish and irish english is also easy to spot out . 
  i honestly do n't even know exactly how new zealand english sounds like , rarely hear it . 
  sometimes i mix up canadian with american . 
  yes . 
  especially in the public sector , there it 's pretty much impossible to get fired in many instances . 
  di do pi\u010di that 's all i know :p, 
  barneskole - elementary ( 6-12 ) - 350 ungdomskole - middle school ( 13-16 ) - 180 videreg\u00e5ende - high school ( 16-19 ) - 600, 
  [ norwegian rally driver accent is also quite funny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcmauwpa-5o ), 
  the secretary general of the council of europe thorbj\u00f8rn jagland is worse imo, 
  not very common i believe . 
  rarely hear about them anyway, 
  we 've had a strong relationship with the us for a while , close allies . 
  however now with trump i question if they can be trusted , with obama i honestly thought our relationship was good and healthy but i do n't trust them nearly as much anymore . 
  we have more beautiful nature :d but in all honesty it 's pretty damn similar . 
  well they 're still very much in use in the nordics , just they 're not legal in most countries ( i believe ) here . 
  firework rockets and some other types of fireworks laser pointers certain weapons ( electroshock weapons , pepper spray , butterfly knives , brass knuckles , throwing stars and certain swords ) reptiles and many other exotic animals ( snakes , lizards , turtles etc ) , however from august certain types of reptiles will be legalized ) segways were also illegal until just a couple of years ago, 
  through history we 've pretty much been an island but do n't think anyone uses that term . 
  as the us is one of our closest allies the government would never dare to question or stand against the us . 
  we defintely suck them off way too much . 
  have n't heard much about their approach to erdogan tbh, 
  i live in a house with a pretty shitty wooden floor so to avoid splinters in my feet i use socks . 
  love his country reviews, 
  [ varg vikernes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varg_vikernes ) is probably the best example . 
  i so often hear foreigner mention him but he really is n't nearly as famous in norway as compared to abroad . 
  he is known in norway of course but mostly for his criminal record , he seems to be quite well known outside of norway , i guess mostly for his role in black metal ? 
  yeah , i 'm related to an american guy who won a olympic silver medal in wrestling . 
  my grandpa who is very into genealogy spends a ton of time tracing and finding people we 're related to . 
  he contacted some of that olympic silver winner 's family and they came over here to visit him and share knowledge . 
  it 's pretty common to have extended in the usa/canada here . 
  as so many norwegians fled to the northern us/canada a while back . 
  my parents are not married so they have seperate last names . 
  my middle name is from my mother 's side and my last name from my father 's . 
  my middle name is scottish , rooting back to some ancestors we had 250-300 years ago from there . 
  my whole mother 's side have this middle name from an old scottish clan .
