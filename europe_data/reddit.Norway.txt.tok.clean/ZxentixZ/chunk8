  no never , my parents would never do that to me . 
  born in 98 and i did do some bad stuff as a kid . 
  visited japan last year and it was amazing . 
  probably the most interesting place i 've ever been to . 
  ca n't wait to visit other places far away , no hate towards europe but going to places on the other side of the planet is just a different experience when i 've grown up here . 
  can highly recommend it to anyone who has n't been outside europe . 
  visited egypt as a kid aswell but it was more or less like the typical beach holiday so i did n't see much of the real country . 
  been to the asian part of turkey 4 times as well but i hardly count them as a proper `` outside europe '' trips as they 've been beach holidays and they 're not very far away . 
  so in total only 2 proper times outside europe . 
  ca n't wait to go on more trips like those though . 
  i like living in my country however the town i live in is pretty dull . 
  it 's a tiny town of 3k people where i 've lived almost my whole life . 
  nothing ever happens here , whilst its a nice place growing up i ca n't really wait until i move out next year ( still living with my parents lol ) . 
  moving north of the polar circle and it 's something i 'm really looking forward to . 
  i really like living in this country , i just need a change within it, 
  maybe norway under haakon haakonsson , [ we owned all this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/norway_about_1265.png ), 
  it 's definitely tradition . 
  it dates back to the early 1900 's and most people if you ask , even elders have been a part of it at some point . 
  it 's mainly in the last 10-20 years though when it has blown completley out of proportion and it 's often criticized because it 's become such a big thing . 
  what is especially common nowadays is for 10-30 students to go together and create a group . 
  buy an old bus or van ( depending on how many members ) and then pimp it to fit the groups custom design/slogan . 
  they spend an awful lot of money on the bus , songs ( which they buy from artists ) , clothes , alcohol and a lot more . 
  while this whole thing is tradition it has been heavily criticized because of the money some students use in this period . 
  one group this year had a budget of 3.2 million nok ( $ 350.000 ) which is ridiculous considering we are talking about 20-30 18 year olds with little financial understanding and income . 
  this whole period is also before/during the most important exams of high school students so it 's not exactly great timing . 
  ca n't be arsed to explain but the article does so fairly accurately . 
  basically just a period during your final high school year where you dress up in coloured overalls and get drunk every day . 
  does n't interest me at all , i 'll stick to the proper football, 
  fuck - sweden kill - sweden marry - iceland, 
  what about nikel or norlisk ? 
  some of the industrial cities in russia are some of the worst i 've seen . 
  those two look abseloutley terrible , ca n't imagine living there . 
  my county ( akershus ) is i believe generally considered by others to be quite densely populated and urbanized . 
  however only a small portion of the county is like that in reality . 
  most of it is agricultural focused and consists of small towns spread across the county . 
  by people in the south-east that know the region better my portion of the county is known to be farmlands filled with angry peasants . 
  we 're looked at as sort of uncivilized and people rarely go here . 
  that 's how a lot of people in the oslo region look at us at least . 
  many of those stereotypes are not really true though . 
  do n't think most people know much about us honestly ... 
  she is sort of a boring leader but doing a decent job . 
  even though i support her party i actually think our last leader from the opposition party is a better leader , just his party 's politics were n't the best imo . 
  but it 's not like you really see that much difference ... 
  we do n't have any huge current problems , we do have some that will come in the future though and we need to start solving those soon . 
  like what we 're going to live off after the oil . 
  it 's not going to last for that much longer and we do n't really have a clear natural alternative . 
  immigration could also be a potential problem considering our welfare state is vulnerable . 
  if we take in as many as we do currently it will likely be a problem down the line . 
  nah , i like our flag and we do n't really have any potential alternatives, 
  never heard most of these , only lapper , spenn , gryn and cash, 
  we have [ bunad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bunad ) and they 're very popular , many are also very pretty in my opinion . 
  there are distinct bunad 's for different parts of the country , for instance the [ nordlandsbunad ] ( https://www.norskflid.no/fileshare/cache/0_800_false_false_1_85__fileshare_filarkivroot_bunad_nordland_nordlandsbunad_nordl%20bl%c3%a5_nordlandblaa_helfigur.jpg ) and [ \u00d8st-telemark ] ( http://www.bunadrosen.no/bilder/damebunad/osttelemark-bunadrosen-prinsesse-01.jpg ) , they also exist for men like [ this one ] ( https://www.norskflid.no/fileshare/cache/0_800_false_false_1_85__fileshare_filarkivroot_bunad_hordaland_voss_herrebunad%20voss_herrebunad_voss_helfigur.jpg ) however , they are more commonly used by women . 
  about 72 % of women own a bunad while only 20 % of men have one themselves . 
  they can also be quite expensive , the cheapest are around the 20.000 nok ( $ 2100 ) mark . 
  they also get quite a lot more expensive than that . 
  30.000 nok ( $ 3200 ) to 50.000 nok ( $ 5300 ) is about the average price if you want to get one . 
  as someone who lives in a norwegian county bordering v\u00e4rmland its the exact same thing here . 
  we call them `` r\u00e5nere '' , driving around in their volvo 240 's ... 
  kebab is quite popular , i love it a bit too much, 
  same here , you ca n't really say the word now without being considered a racist but it was common before . 
  it 's quite common here , i know many people that does it . 
  i despise it myself though , never done it and probably never will . 
  do n't really see the point when you have tomato sauce already on it . 
  * ** copenhagen ** - seems like the `` best '' city in the nordics of the big ones , beautiful , great atmosphere , lots to do , great resturants and generally good in most ways . 
  would n't mind living there * ** bergen ** - never been there actually but from what i 've heard and seen it seems like a really nice city . 
  beautiful location and not far to the fjords and high mountains . 
  weather is shit but that has to be a sacrifice , probably one of the cities i most want to live in , in norway . 
  * ** manchester ** - my favorite football team is from there and playing there , would love to be able to go to every home game . 
  also a nice city all around , few shabby areas but generally quite nice with good nightlife . 
  i 'm quite happy with living in norway though , not sure if i would want to move permanently to another country . 
  we call it `` dugnad '' , it 's very common and sort of an integral part of norwegian society . 
  it 's usually a pretty local thing and especially in rural areas we value it highly and it 's often expected you take part in it , not sure if it is as common in big cities . 
  in smaller sports clubs its often used to finance trips or to help the club in one way or another . 
  at youth level within a football team the parents of the players often do work for the club , for instance operating a kiosk ( selling food/drinks etc ) or do charity work so the club can send the kids on a sport event . 
  in small towns its also often used to get things done . 
  people within for instance a neighbourhood will meet up and do some work for the society that will benefit everyone together . 
  the weather along the coast is mild during the winter , which is also where most people live . 
  however in the inland where i live we can have pretty bad winters with really cold temperatures . 
  it was pretty bad in many cities , especially the ones up north , here are two pictures from [ narvik ] ( https://gfx.nrk.no/tmhivhjtkjzsy9z2haxwxgjl5hylslq5du3rs-snzfha ) and [ kristiansund ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/bombingen_av_kristiansund%2c_1940%2c_riksarkivet%2c_arkivreferanse_pa_1667u2_050.jpg ) during the war . 
  a lot of cities were completley destroyed . 
  i 've been to many decently sized cities where only 1-2 buildings remained after the bombings . 
  large parts of northern norway have signs in both sami and norwegian . 
  [ example ] ( http://img8.custompublish.com/getfile.php/2043542.758.cvwwaufudr/kaafjordkommuneskilt.jpg ) apparently oslo are also getting some sami signs soon which is pretty ridiculous tbh , i understand up north but it seems like a waste of money and time setting them up in oslo . 
  [ stalin ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/stalin_1902.jpg/220px-stalin_1902.jpg ) looked like a model in his early years but perhaps not as attractive when he became a ruler, 
  i eat it with normal bread i get at the local supermarket , nothing fancy . 
  i fry the eggs and have them on the bread with bacon on the side . 
  i do n't use normal bacon from the supermarket but rather some other really tasty bacon from my local butcher , bit more expensive but amazing in taste . 
  eggs and bacon , pretty much what i eat every week-end for breakfast . 
   skiing - but the real skiing where they ski down a mountain . 
  not the fake kind where they need to use their arms to push themselves because it is so flat triggered :d, 
  eeew, 
  well napoleon was the leader of the first french republic so in his first times as leader he was sort of a dicator . 
  do europeans do that ? 
  i 've never once in my life seen anyone eat french fries with mayo, 
  yeah i know several people . 
  it 's not uncommon studying a year over in the us or australia . 
  would n't mind doing that one year myself if i ever get the chance . 
  we 're very similar countries , does n't really matter which one you pick . 
  norway will be a tad more expensive but sweden is n't exactly cheap either . 
  wherever you pick you 'll probably have a nice time .
