  [ made a map some months back ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dvbl4xi.png ) seen a fair bit , more than most people i know . 
  been to 16/19 counties , unfortunately not seen that much on the south-western coast , hopefully will one day . 
  might go to finnmark ( northernmost county ) this summer and see the very north . 
  also spent a fair bit of time in many of the areas i marked on the map . 
  i 'm not really worried about muslim immigration in particular . 
  too much immigration by people who struggle to integrate no matter background is scary in the long term . 
  i 'm not really worried about terrorist attacks , extremeley unlikely to hurt me as i 'm living in a tiny town where no one would ever come to commit such an act anyways . 
  just curious . 
  what do you do the whole day ? 
  i sometimes feel like i have nothing to do in my time off . 
  surely you need something to occupy your time with when you 're never working ? 
  any hobbies or things you do ? 
  a somewhat recent one that i can remember very well was norway 0-1 hungary in the play offs for the euro 2016 football championship . 
  i was in the stadium as well which makes it more memorable , we had not qualified for a major football event in 16 years ( since 2000 ) and finally looked to end just that . 
  we played fairly well the qualifiers but could n't qualify automatically so we ended up in the play offs against arguably the worst team that was even in there , hungary . 
  there was actually some positive hype around the national team for once and we looked like the favorites before the game but then we lost both home and away and did n't qualify . 
  as a huge football fan this made me pretty sad . 
  i 've never seen my nation play at a major competition , was only a few years old in 2000 so it would have been huge if we qualified . 
  about 10 days ago we had a ton of snow , was literally more here one day than any day in the last winter . 
  many people had to change back to winter tires after having used summer ones for a good while . 
  it was also a bit cold . 
  we have had great weather the past week though , it 's currently around 15-20 degrees and sunny where i live which is perfect . 
  it 's more about spending money in neighbouring countries where a lot of refugees/people are located . 
  lebanon for instance , a country with millions of refugees but not enough infrastructure and money to help those that need it . 
  as a start we need to establish decent quality living standards for the people in those areas . 
  we 're not going to be able to save syria alone but when the situation there is stable then obviously help them back and help rebuild the country . 
  as things stand currently the money should be spent in neighbouring countries to help them handle the migration crisis . 
  of course we can take in some , like children in need but we ca n't take everyone . 
  hehe . 
  honestly that would be pretty damn cool , i 'm sort of sad that we did n't stick to a norse type language and i 'd honestly not mind myself having icelandic as our main language . 
  only problem would be no one here speaks it and it 's still quite a bit different from norwegian . 
  so we would need 5 million people to immediately learn a new language and adapt to it . 
  would n't ever happen but it would certainly be a very cool and interesting union . 
  if norway and iceland ever were to reunite it would probably be with both languages having an official status and both being offered to students in schools . 
  i 'd always be up for merging with iceland . 
  they are our long lost brothers who we need to unite with :d, 
  yeah pretty much . 
  instead of spending enormous resources on taking people in to our countries let 's spend that money in those areas where the people come from . 
  it 's a lot more cost-effective , we help many more people with spending the same while at the same time not threatening our own countries . 
  i live in norway if my flair does n't already show . 
  we have huge problems with people not integrating well enough, 
  negative . 
  statistics are not lying , a ton of immigrants struggle to adapt and integrate into society . 
  in a country like ours with heavy emphasis on the welfare state this will ruin it in the long term . 
  the welfare state essentially operates as a company and when a ton of people come in and do n't contribute while sucking huge amouts out of it that 's terrible in the long term . 
  i 'm not against helping people , we definitely should send a lot of money to areas that need it but i think it 's more benefical to both sides if we spend the money where the people live . 
  the money will help a lot more people and it wo n't impact our welfare state . 
  some immigration is fine i guess but far from as much as it is currently . 
  true . 
  some say polar bears guard the royal palace . 
  we got polar bears :p, 
  remember when i was a kid i really wanted to work in lego . 
  can pretty much understand 95-100 % swedish . 
  live close to the border , been there many times and my accent use some swedish words you do n't see in most other norwegian accents . 
  understand most of it apart from some few distinct words . 
  i could speak a sort of shitty mix of norwegian-swedish if i tried but it would n't really be swedish . 
  i could easily learn to speak it if i really wanted to though , it 's just not really worth it . 
  i can also understand spoken danish to an extent , totally depends on the speaker . 
  someone that speaks slow and clearly with a copenhagen dialect are understandable for the most part but danes in regular speech are difficult to properly understand . 
  written danish i understand pretty much 100 %, 
  those are nice areas but the whole of russia would n't be a bad addition to the norwegian empire :p i guess we could turn to reuniting norway at its peak when we had iceland , greenland , faroe islands and the areas you mentioned when we 're done with russia . 
  we would be a world superpower :d, 
  would n't mind that . 
  finally the whole of the uk under norwegian rule . 
  our dream since 1066 :d, 
  we will easily invade through our border with them . 
  take over the north west then move into st. petersburg and moscow before an annexation of siberia . 
  when we have all that we 'll just take the far east and we 're done . 
  totally realisitic :d, 
  i 've seen quite a lot of 240 's when i 've been up north . 
  but yeah it 's true its not unique for northern norway . 
  they 're just as common in the south . 
  240 's are especially common in \u00d8stfold which is another sort of redneck area . 
  generally speaking the 3 or 4 northernmost counties , nordland , troms and finnmark . 
  drinks quite a lot , distinct dialects and laws seem to apply and be tolerated less than in the south . 
  also quite a lot of people ( mostly young ) who drive around in volvo 240 's . 
  in norway this is sort of the sign of a young redneck . 
  the 3 northernmost counties are also the least educated . 
  i do n't have anything against these regions though , far from everybody are like this and even most people considered `` rednecks '' are cool people all around . 
  few are like the rednecks people think about in america . 
  17-18 degrees sunny with next to no wind is perfect . 
  any warmer than that and i 'm dead, 
  first sip i guess 13-15 , ca n't really remember . 
  first time i properly drank was at 16-17 . 
  currently 19 and alcohol does n't really interest me , i drink a 0.5 l maybe a couple of times a month at most . 
  never ever been drunk either ... 
  yeah we have that and the variety is pretty good . 
  you get a different type of competance in your diploma according to what path you choose , these are the two main groups of paths , `` preperation for further studies '' and `` vocotional '' with more specific paths below . 
  ** preperation for further studies ** these ones all give competance for further studies at a university etc and some of the paths share a lot of similar subjects . 
  * `` further studies '' - most common one and it is for people who want to study at a university , often quite specific things at a university that require particular subjects . 
  this path gives you a lot of variety between choosing subjects . 
  * `` sports '' - pretty self explanatory , path for people who want to pursue a sport or just people that like a particular sport in general . 
  it shares some subjects with `` further studies '' but it integrates sport as well * `` music , dance and drama '' - for people who want to work with one of those mentioned * `` media and communication '' - graphic design , photography , journalism and creating stuff in general like short films etc * `` art and design '' - painting and art etc ** vocational education ** then there are a bunch of paths that do n't give you the chance to pursue higher education unless you take some add on subjects . 
  these paths give you a quite restricted but specific path towards a vocational career . 
  there are seperate paths such as `` resturant and cooking '' , `` building and construction '' and essentially one for `` farming '' . 
  there are quite a few more . 
  within all of the paths you can chose there are even more specific paths within the main paths you can choose between . 
  for instance within the `` sports '' path you can choose between studying and playing particular sports , like football , handball or skiing . 
  `` further studies '' also gives you a lot of choice between subjects . 
  it 's pretty poorly handled , at least that 's the way the media is portraying it .
