i believe them being nazis and hating people of colour is a huge exaggeration . 
  there were people wearing the nazi eagle necklace , people with nazi tattoos , large groups of people chanting '' * blood and soil * '' a translated nazi slogan '' * blut und boden * '' , they were doing the nazi salute and chanting heil trump , and they beat up poc with poles . 
  how is that a `` huge exaggeration '' ? 
  past what prime ? 
  the one where we fought some of the bloodiest wars in our species history against each other ? 
  where we colonised other nations ? 
  or the prime where we did n't have any of the rights/benefits/quality of life that we enjoy today ? 
  i think europe is about to enter it 's prime in the coming decades . 
  i saw few people wearing new balance shoes , mostly kids wearing the trainers and skaters wearing their `` skating '' shoes . 
  i saw a lot more people wear blinking trainers or geox than i saw new balance trainers . 
  the skaters wearing new balance quickly replaced them with dc shoes . 
  are you sure you 're not confusing it with vans ? 
  because they were extremely popular there . 
  soju and body odours . 
  yeah , and we pay less taxes in december , so there 's more money to be spent . 
  it 's because of christmas , it gives people more time to do their christmas shopping . 
  the roads get ploughed frequently , so getting there is n't an issue . 
  korean food . 
  especially korean bbq . 
  it 's a shame we do n't have it back home . 
  you mean those rolling skies ? 
  when i travel to sweden i usually buy johnnys for mustard and bbq sauce . 
  i think american english is simpler than british english . 
  a lot of letters are dropped or written differently in american english , which makes it easier than british english imo . 
  as someone who learnt english as a fourth language , i found american english to be simpler than british . 
  that 's just my opinion and it 's up to each individual whether they agree with me or not . 
  but what i do n't understand is why you think my opinion is ignorant and arrogant . 
   what is your favorite american accent ? 
  what is your favorite native anglo accent ? 
  favourite american accent is the one used by harvey specter in suits , i do n't know what it 's called . 
  favourite anglo accent is received pronunciation . 
  what is your favorite american accent ? 
  what is your favorite native anglo accent ? 
  received pronunciation for both . 
  i lived in b\u00e6rum , i never heard or saw anyone do that there . 
  i did n't know people would skied to work in other places , til . 
  i never heard of anyone who did that at least . 
  skiing to work just seems like a hassle to me . 
  when i visited iran i was asked by some older people if we had to ski to school/work . 
  a few people also asked how i deal with the polar bears roaming around . 
  i have gotten a ton of dumb questions about norwegian or swedish girls . 
  these days i do n't get asked that many dumb questions , i hear/read about people making dumb statements a lot more . 
  the mall near my village also extended their opening time by an hour in december . 
  both are very rare . 
  i have n't heard anyone get cat called in a long time . 
  the few times i saw/heard it , it happened in oslo and it was done by young immigrants trying to act cool/tough in front of their friends . 
  every civilized person think they 're obnoxious and annoying af . 
  for street flirting i have seen it happen before . 
  one time there was this spanish guy who tried to hit on/flirt with my classmate . 
  it was just weird to watch and it made me cringe , she kept telling him no and he kept nagging saying `` only one cup of coffee '' . 
  other than this i saw it happen once more by some weirdo in a full bus and once by a mentally ill person . 
  wait , you do n't use butter for cooking steak ?? 
  damn , you 're missing out bro . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_european_framework_of_reference_for_languages#common_reference_levels ) is an explanation of it . 
  ** c2 proficiency : ** english and norwegian ** b2 proficiency : ** swedish , danish and arabic ** b1 proficiency : ** turkish , assyrian , german , korean , farsi , kurdish ** a2 proficiency : ** japanese ** a1 proficiency : ** spanish and french i am a lot better at speaking/listening than i am at reading or writing for most of the languages i know . 
  languages like kurdish , assyrian , farsi and turkish i suck at reading & writing , because i learnt them by talking with family members while i was growing up . 
  i never got any lessons on how to read or write for those languages . 
   not just on a world scale , but also between european countries . 
  like can someone who is french look at someone and think `` ah he is italian '' for me it 's kinda difficult to differentiate based on their facial features , how they walk or dress alone . 
  it 's much easier to judge on their behaviour . 
  but even then , it 's hard to know their specific nationality without hearing them talk . 
   wow . 
  you must be tall and/or quite striking then i suppose . 
  i am not very tall or striking . 
  i dislike talking about this because it makes me feel like an arrogant cock . 
  if you really want to know , i can talk about this with you in pm . 
   umm , so are you approached much more in sweden , or was it just about the same to the us girls ? 
  i have n't spent much time in sweden . 
  but i got approached a lot more in the us . 
  i think it 's because of the dating culture . 
  nobody approaches you in say a cafe in norway . 
  but in the us that happened many times . 
   have you ever been out to any other regions or only in cali ? 
  i was on the east coast , minnesota , texas , wisconsin as well . 
  but i did n't spend too much time in those places with the exception of the east coast . 
  it was the same in the east coast as it was in cali . 
  i got approached a few times in minnesota as well . 
  i think the reason i was getting approached a lot in the us was because of the `` features '' i have . 
  sure my looks helped , but i imagine being different from the local guys made them more interested in me . 
  i watch very little norwegian tv . 
  i mostly watch reruns of a show called `` mot i br\u00f8stet '' . 
  i like american , british , korean and japanese ( anime ) tv shows . 
  there are shows from other nations i watch as well , but they 're few and far between . 
   hey , thanks for the personal attack , wish i was cool as you :d it was n't meant as a personal attack , apologies if it came across that way . 
  and i just re-read your comment now , i misunderstood it a little . 
  i 'll edit my comment , my bad . 
   however my 3 out of 100 comment is true for many attractive guys i know . 
  for me , it must be 0 out 300 . hopefully i can be half as hot as you in my next life though . 
  ;d well i got approached quite a lot when i did an exchange semester at berkeley , that 's why i made the comment . 
  and i am not a 10 either , according to what people have told me i 'm a 7-8 . 
  there were certain ` features ' that i have which girls in the us liked a lot . 
  maybe that 's why ? 
  to answer your question , in norway i get approached by girls a fair amount , say like 15-20 % of the time ? 
  i do n't have an exact number though . 
  i approach the girls myself most of them time . 
   i remember i tried to be a part of the denmark joke on r/sweden but i just got hate that 's because it 's similar to sibling love . 
  we will make fun and joke about one another , but if anyone else does it we 'll defend each other . 
  that 's how i feel about it at least . 
   for dudes in america ( that i know ) , it must be less than 3 times out of going to clubs 100 times that girls have come up to them with the intention to hit on them . 
  you must be unattractive then .
