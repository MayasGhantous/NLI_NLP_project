  i have been to busan . 
  favorite part was the seafood and visiting the markets . 
  my favorite place has been jeju . 
   i have lived there for a while with a sk citizen if you know what i mean . 
  i 'm not really catching your drift , sorry . 
  you were married to someone , living with a partner or living with a roommate ? 
   also i recommend you to visit / move to the little-big 6 as i call them cities . 
  i have travelled around the country for festivals and other attractions/activities . 
   what else do you want to do during nightlife ? 
  maybe i worded my sentence poorly . 
  i meant that the nightlife is mediocre , and that there is n't much to do besides partying/drinking in norway . 
  not that the nightlife is mediocre because of partying/drinking is the only thing to do . 
   sorry i meant what is the reason for you being in seoul ? 
  do you study/work there ? 
  oh , my bad . 
  yeah i am an exchange student here . 
   i am `` almost '' native to sk as i had conducted some business there in the past . 
  i am not quite sure what you mean by that . 
  were you born there or did you move there and settled down ? 
   what do you do in seoul ? 
  the nightlife is amazing and it 's cheap . 
  i visit palaces , memorials , museums , shopping districts , markets , find new and unique restaurants , different types of cafes . 
  i recently visited a raccoon cafe , it was amazing . 
  sometimes i visit pc bangs with my friends , we attend various festivals , and visit amusement parks . 
  lotte world is my favorite . 
  escape rooms are also quite fun to do . 
  we also go to the han river from time to time . 
  just sitting there talking , eating , and drinking . 
  i also really like to just take the tube to random places and explore different parts of the city . 
  i enter a random tube , go off at a random station and start exploring it . 
  it technically is n't seoul , but i visited the dmz with my friends . 
  it was a very interesting trip . 
  that 's your opinion and you 're entitled to it . 
  but saying that there 's nothing to see there besides ` failed states ' is ignorant . 
  why is taking a vacation to the middle-east going the wrong way ? 
  there are lots of beautiful places , and historical places to visit . 
  the food is good , and the people are warm and welcoming . 
  just because you 're going on a vacation does n't mean you 're leaving europe for the middle-east . 
   well i do n't give a shit about nightlife . 
  so maybe you should say that there 's little to do for some youngsters , not all . 
  if you reread what i wrote . 
   another negative thing *** for me *** is that it can get quite boring for young people . 
  in terms of nightlife . 
  sure there are lots of outdoor activities and sports you can do , but besides that there is n't much to do . 
  doing the same activities over and over gets repetitive and boring imo . 
  i currently live in seoul and there 's just so much more to do here compared to back home . 
  on top of that , it 's very expensive in norway for a student . 
  i am currently living in seoul , and it just blows everything back home out of the water . 
  in norway i live close to oslo , but it 's just incomparable . 
  there is so much more to do and it 's most of it is open at any hour . 
  norway is an amazing place to grow up and an amazing place to raise children , but once you hit your 20s-30s it gets very boring imo . 
  the nightlife is mediocre , there is n't too much to do outside of partying/drinking and it 's very expensive as a student . 
  oslo also gets stale and boring quickly imo . 
  i currently live in seoul right now , and oslo ca n't hold a candle to seoul when it comes to activities available . 
   such dissmebling bullshit , anything to protect your precious immigrants eh ? 
  acid attacks in the uk were so common it even had its own name at the time : vitriolage . 
  it has even shown up in a [ sherlock holmes ] ( http://bakerstreet.wikia.com/wiki/the_adventure_of_the_illustrious_client ) story . 
  but hey , continue blaming immigrants for everything wrong in your society , and i 'm sure blaming them will solve it . 
   the only negative thing i can think of is the weather and the fact that we live so far away from the rest of europe . 
  another negative thing for me is that it can get quite boring for young people . 
  there is n't much to do . 
  i never hated my ethnicity , but it did cause me to go through an identity crisis when i was younger . 
  for me it was more dislike towards my family 's religion and the cultural aspects that came with it . 
  as i grew up , i started disliking almost all religions though . 
   however , some people do argue that it was originally brought here by muslim/indian immigrants and then later adopted by all the other gangs , but i do n't know enough to say whether that 's true or not . 
  acid attacks have been fairly common in england for a very long time , it was n't originally brought there by muslims/indian immigrants . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/11/acid-attacks-victorian-britain just one story about it but there are lots of historical articles floating about if you want to google `` it was common enough , as late as 1938 , for graham greene to have his sinister protagonist pinkie carry a small bottle of acid in brighton rock . '', 
  gangs used acid as a fairly common weapon in victorian england . 
  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xkr4k2bpqhwc&amp;pg=pt240&amp;lpg=pt240&amp;dq=acid+gang+weapon+england+victorian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qivk6yvbva&amp;sig=o1rhoeroevh3pxpzj0js_b6h7d0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewinmas6xojvahwcl1akhvwgdm0q6aeiszag#v=onepage&amp;q=acid%20gang%20weapon%20england%20victorian&amp;f=false `` nitric acid was a horrible weapon used by criminals '', 
  it depends . 
  it 's not just mena immigrants . 
  here 's a list made by a redditor in a thread about a acid attack . 
  yes i am from b\u00e6rum . 
  i knew a lot of people with vacation homes in either spain , greece or thailand . 
  i am from one of the richest districts in norway though , so it might be a different for me . 
  i do n't know how common a vacation home is in other districts . 
  almost everyone i met had a cabin they 'd visit with their families though . 
  it depends on where i am . 
  in norway i showered every morning during summer and 3-4 times a week during winter . 
  i am currently living in korea and it 's warm and humid right now , so it 's not uncommon for me to shower twice a day . 
  [ 80 % of our exports go to the eu ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/nor/ ) , we need them . 
  i do n't think there would be a big difference if we joined the eu . 
  we 're already part of the eea and schengen area . 
  still seems like the same thing to me . 
  one is here short term the other is here long term . 
  but that 's just me . 
   but seriously , they 're in a different socio-economic bracket and as such have different levels of privilege , one such privilege being how much they 're expected to adapt to the host country . 
  that i can understand , but it still seems like it is the same thing to me tbh . 
  but that 's just me . 
  they seem like the same thing to me tbh . 
  i do n't see how earning more or working for a foreign company is any different than earning less and working for a local company . 
  what 's the difference between expat and immigrants ? 
  i never understood that . 
  i know this is kinda late , but i just want to say that it 's very similar in norway . 
  there was a story in the news about how a somalian boy applied for over 200 jobs but was never called in for an interview . 
  then one day he uses a fake norwegian name and applies at a store they rejected him from , and the day after he sent in his application he was called in for an interview . 
  after they found out he was black they made some bs excuse about not being able to give him the job . 
  i am still a student so i have n't experienced any myself , but it did seriously affect what career i wanted to pursue . 
  personally i really wanted to become a diplomat or a judge , but my dad said that i should n't pursue those careers as they 'd never hire me . 
  after listening to his arguments , experiences of his friends and checking online i realized what he was saying is true .
