  translation : we call her ` aisha ' , but that is not her real name . 
  she will not reveal her identity , and will not show her face . 
  but aisha , who is a woman in her 50s , tell about how she went forward to come to norway :  it is said that norway is the best country for refugees . 
  so i visited some websites that explained details around asylum applications to norway . 
  that 's why i went . 
  on facebook and other websites are many posts in arabic promoting asylum travels to norway . 
  here it is said that you get 3,000 nok a month ( 340 euros ) as an asylum seeker , and an apartment . 
  ** came to finnmark , northern norway ** aisha is from syria , but moved to dubai in the united arab emirates several years before the civil war in syria began in 2011 . 
  when she decided to travel to norway , she first went to the capital of the uae , abu dhabi , to get russian visa . 
  she then followed the popular route to russian-norwegian border . 
  tickets and stay in moscow cost her 60,000 nok ( 6,600 euros ) . 
  she also had pay an additionally 40,000 nok ( 4,400 euros ) to the smuggler who brought her to the norwegian border . 
  from storskog she was sent to the emergency asylum centre at tingnes in hedmark - then brought to ordinary reception in sj\u00f8vegan in troms . 
  the stay there did not meet her expectations . 
   honestly , i was shocked . 
  i thought norway was more modern and more civilized . 
  it was so cold there . 
  cold in every possible way . 
  we stayed in a very small village , with only two supermarkets . 
  we had to walk for an hour to get there . 
  and then you had to carry all the heavy groceries back to the reception by yourself . 
  it was very tough for me . 
  ** - not enough food ** sj\u00f8vegan state reception has so-called self catering . 
  residents get 3,000 kroner ( 340 euros ) a month , but must buy and cook their own food . 
   the food !, 
  it was the biggest problem . 
  it was neither organic or unprocessed . 
  we had not enough vegetables , and not enough food . 
  and the meat !, 
  it was full of blood . 
  during the two months i was there , i never ate meat . 
  at the reception you live in apartments that can accommodate six people , with its own kitchen and bathroom . 
  each applicant shares with another . 
   we were six women , and the rooms were very , very small . 
  and the beds were for children . 
  if one turned to the right or left you would fall out . 
   it was very bad conditions at the asylum center . 
  this camp was not suitable for people . 
  i could not stay there . 
  ** received money to leave norway ** so aisha said goodbye and left , and withdrew his asylum application . 
  for the journey back home she received 20,000 nok ( 2,200 euros ) from the norwegian government , through the organization international organization for migration ( iom ) , which distributes repatriation money on behalf of the norwegian authorities . 
  anyone traveling home from a reception center before they have been rejected can get this amount in travel support . 
  back in dubai , she could finally return to the life she was accustomed to . 
   we have a completely different lifestyle here in the gulf . 
  we live a life of luxury here . 
  the main thing i learned after the stay in norway was that you are not any richer than we are here . 
  ** new apartment in dubai ** aisha sends us pictures of her new flat , with a beautiful kitchen and living room . 
  and a huge bed . 
  when she goes to the supermarket there are always people who carry the groceries to the car . 
  she says that she knows many syrians who have traveled to norway to seek asylum even if they come from the uae , saudi arabia or kuwait . 
  all which are peaceful and prosperous countries . 
  many of them have now returned from norway . 
   i came to norway to be a norwegian , to get another passport . 
  you know , with a syrian passport it 's not so easy to travel these days . 
  everyone wants to get a european passport , not only me ** - following the requirements of the norwegian authorities ** sj\u00f8vegan reception has sent nrk this comment to the statements of aisha : `` sj\u00f8vegan reception center is a well-established reception with extensive experience , and follows udi requirements and guidelines . 
  according to udis requirements receptions should be simple and offer proper accommodations ensuring resident 's basic needs and security . 
  sj\u00f8vegan reception , on a par with most asylum centers do not serve food prepared by chefs . 
  each asylum seeker will be paid benefits and retain responsibility for the procurement of food and must prepare their own food . 
  all udi demands are fulfilled . '', 
  ** lures asylum seekers to norway ** one of the arab facebook pages promoting asylum travels to norway has also used an image from a refugees welcome demonstration in front the norwegian parliament which was organized by the norwegian people 's aid in september this year . 
  smiling young people holding posters with text in arabic , `` welcome to norway . '', 
  at the bottom of the poster is the logo of the norwegian people 's aid . 
  above this picture stands an invitation in arabic from the people behind the facebook account : `` asylum in norway . 
  only serious . 
  get in touch ! '', 
  i think most norwegians actually has n't cared too much about immigration .
