it is n't just the internet though , it 's been covered in the mainstream media as well . 
  see ? 
  that 's what the weather further south does to your mood . 
  that 's what it 's like . 
  tropical , but it does n't kill you . 
  i guess you get a bit fed up with the wind when living on a barren rock in the ocean . 
  to be fair , they do have [ certain things ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8305/7772272194_7028d54143_b.jpg ) weighing up for it . 
  also , it 's not really true . 
  the north gets seriously cold , and there 's regular flooding all over the south , where it 's also reasonably chilly . 
  oh , i could n't possibly, 
  that we 're obscenely rich and somehow resistant to anything the weather gods decide to send our way . 
  oh yeah , and that everything is expensive ( which is true , and i like it . ), 
  this is really a conspiracy to coup the west end . 
  kult !, 
  also because we can afford it . 
  i believe this was also true for germany and austria earlier , but i think austria has changed theirs . 
  ^ but ^ i ^ was ^ referring ^ to ^ our ^ neighbour 's ^ blatant ^ disrespect ^ for ^ norwegian ^ traditions , ^ although ^ that ^ is ^ nothing ^ new . 
   e.g. 
  the uk and norway what, 
  i 'd say [ kenwood house ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_k4tmjhjuajs/tlocqvwj8ti/aaaaaaaabhs/nw2eaxxv2jw/s1600/southside+063.jpg ) on hampstead heath in london . 
  it 's quite small as far as mansions go , but it 's so pretty inside , especially [ the library ] ( http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/remote/www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/properties/kenwood-house/gallery-for-kenwood-house/_g2v9266_flattened_edit.jpg?w=1144&amp;mode=none&amp;scale=downscale&amp;quality=60&amp;anchor=middlecenter ) , and its rembrandts and vermeers and turners do n't hurt either . 
  i would easily move it from oslo to saint-tropez . 
  i would certainly not mind some of that sweet riviera weather around these parts . 
  i 'll go for the [ faroese clothes for women ] ( https://kvf.fo/sites/default/files/foroysk_klaedir.jpg ) . 
  from europe , still not actually danish . 
  then we would leave immediately , taking greenland and the faroes with us this time around . 
  i did n't notice too many differences while i was living there last year , but perhaps the most glaring one is that the rich are a lot richer and the poor a lot poorer than they are over here . 
  i also thought that the uk was more obviously capitalist than norway , i felt like there were very few places i went where i did n't have to think about money in some way . 
  yeah , we do , but it does n't really do the same thing . 
  * `` surely he 's too old '' * would mean that you are of the opinion that he 's too old and that it 's close to fully certain that he is , but * `` han er sikkert for gammel '' * is just a guess , an assumption that he 's too old . 
  we have another construction : * `` han m\u00e5 da v\u00e6re for gammel ? 
  '' * which is sort of close , but i still think that 's too vague , and it does n't always work out , especially when you 're using * surely * on its own . 
  the one that bothers me the most is the word * surely * . 
  there 's no way to translate that one accurately into norwegian . 
  so , for a brief overview , we have : * * nrk * is the national broadcaster , running online sites , radio stations ( lots ) and traditional tv . 
  they 're sometimes accused of leaning to the left , but they 're generally trying their best to stay neutral . 
  i 'd expect these guys to have the best reputation among our major outlets . 
  * * tv2 * , the other major tv channel ( s ) , doing mostly as the above , but in my view in a slightly more tabloid way . 
  ( leaning to the left myself , i 'd say they 're slightly right-leaning , but i 'm obviously biased ) . they run our only pure news channel on tv . 
  * * verdens gang * is a major newspaper , generally considered to be more tabloid than it used to be , and definitely more than it needs to , but it 's still well-regarded , i 'd say . 
  not easy to say where they 're leaning at the moment . 
  probably the most neutral or undecided among our national newspapers . 
  * * dagbladet * is another major ( although sharply declining ) newspaper , traditionally associated with the labour party . 
  they 're often ridiculed for being too tabloid and have been losing credibility for some years now . 
  * * aftenposten * is currently the largest newspaper , respected and reputable . 
  they 're firmly seated on the right , with the party currently in power ( h\u00f8yre ) . 
  * * dagens n\u00e6ringsliv * is another right-leaning paper , mostly focusing on trade , economics and the stock market , and probably our best source for that kind of news . 
  * * klassekampen * , literally * class struggle * is a traditionally communist newspaper , although they 're not quite as stalin-loving as they may have been a couple of decades ago . 
  by some , it 's considered a staple of your political ideas if you even touch this one , but it 's still got a good reputation . 
  i think this one is our best daily newspaper , and it has also been the only national news outlet with growth these past few years . 
  * * dagsavisen * is historically attached to the labour movement , but has been losing importance over the years . 
  i do n't know too many who read this one anymore . 
  * * morgenbladet * is a weekly newspaper which used to be quite conservative , but in the last decades , it has oriented itself towards academics ( and therefore more liberal and radical people ) and has become our most important intellectual paper . 
  this one often has amazing stuff going on . 
  probably the most famous one is about arne treholt , who was an official at the foreign office during the 80 's . 
  in 1984 , he was apprehended and the following year sentenced for treason , allegedly having handed over confidential documents to the kgb . 
  he was released some years later and has been campaigning for a retrial ever since , claiming that the evidence against him was fabricated by the government , but it has n't happened yet . 
  the case resurfaces from time to time with new arguments from both sides . 
  and he currently lives partly in moscow and partly in cyprus , trading in russian bonds , so there 's that . 
  it 's not that they 're hard to get to , it 's just that i ca n't see how they 'll get in my way , as it were . 
  the only reason i 've been to andorra is that i was going from france to barcelona , and i thought it 'd be nice to take the detour . 
  i will definitely visit them all at some point , or at least i hope i will . 
  if not , i think i 'll be most likely to never go to liechtenstein , san marino and monaco . 
  nytt p\u00e5 nytt is far and away the most popular show on tv and it has been for many years , with consistently around a million tuning in every friday . 
  it 's a panel show with a presenter and two teams , each consisting of one permanent member and one famous person of some kind ; politicians , comedians , musicians etc. 
  it discusses ( mostly domestic ) news in a satirical tone , resembling the style of hignfy in the uk ( by which it was originally inspired ) . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://tv.nrk.no/serie/nytt-paa-nytt ) the program from yesterday , featuring our minister of defence . 
  surely it 's not ? 
  would help out if i could afford to even enter a liquor store . 
  we 're not the only ones to have mountains either , but i sure do like ours . 
  yes . 
  * vinmonopolet * , literally the wine monopoly . 
  good call , it really is n't . 
  i 'm just sad and accepting, 
  '94 is also important because of the olympics , which are remembered with only slightly unhealthy levels of pride . 
  well , maybe 793 and 1397 , but i 'd say 1524 is a stretch . 
  i do n't think many would be able to identify anything special about that year . 
  if 1524 is on that list , then there would surely be many more ( 995 , 1319 , 1660 , 1884 , 1972 , 1991 , to name some ) , and that 's not really what the question was about . 
  yeah , you did n't come across as the most thoughtful person, 
  the point i was trying to make was that we still remember many things that happened in 2011 , but in the future , say 20-30 years , it may become more synonymous with the 22.07 attacks than it currently is . 
  exciting things happen every second if you 're prepared to look out for them , 
  all magnificent though slightly inferior to us . 
  so for norway : 872\u00a01030\u00a01066\u00a01349 1537\u00a01718\u00a01814\u00a01905 1940\u00a01994\u00a02011 may become one of these in the future, 
  i do know , but i also observe that u/eurovisionist7 answered op 's question in a way which suggests he does not . 
  asking about the `` american natives '' wo n't resolve that . 
  he has already answered what you are asking in the way he understands it . 
  a * native american * is a person of the indigenous populations of the us . 
  an * american native * , not so much . 
  what you want to ask is : * `` so you were n't taught about any of the native peoples of the us ( or at least of what is now known as the us ) '' *, 
  you know , in continental europe , american means * from america * , i.e. 
  from [ this place . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/n%26samerica-pol.jpg ), 
  yeah , we also do n't . 
  but apparently we have the easiest time understanding the two others . 
  i think it might be the law, 
  what happens ? 
  the most likely thing to happen would be the abolition of the monarchy and imprisonment of the crown prince . 
  well , it is n't really that simple . 
  you 're right , we did agree to the kalmar union , of which denmark came to be the dominating power . 
  when norwegian sovereignty ceased to exist around the reformation , it did n't happen with unanimous consent , though .
