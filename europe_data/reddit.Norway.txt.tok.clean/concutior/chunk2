  christian iii went in with force to depose the clergy and sent the archbishop into exile . 
  at this point , there really was n't a lot of opposition left . 
  the absolute monarchy was introduced largely because everyone was broke . 
  and you ca n't call us equals . 
  every bureaucrat was danish , every decision was taken in copenhagen . 
  and christian frederik was elected by the norwegian assembly , the danish king had no say in that . 
  there 's a reason it 's remembered as the 400-year night . 
  i guess you 're forgiven , now that we buy all our flesk from you , 
  is something voluntary if everyone agrees , but only those who agree are allowed a say ? 
  i 'm not so sure . 
  i think the difference is basically what that imperialist swede said . 
  i realise our education in literature is lacking , because we certainly did n't read as many books as some in this thread did , but these are the ones i remember : ** norwegian class : ** * * gunnlaugs saga ormstungu * * * erasmus montanus * by ludvig holberg * * et dukkehjem ( a doll 's house ) * by henrik ibsen * * hedda gabler * by henrik ibsen * * en folkefiende ( an enemy of the people ) * by henrik ibsen * * n\u00e5r vi d\u00f8de v\u00e5gner ( when we dead awaken ) * by henrik ibsen * * synn\u00f8ve solbakken * by bj\u00f8rnstjerne bj\u00f8rnson * * pan * by knut hamsun * * victoria * by knut hamsun * * de svake ( the weak ) * by ronald fangen ( optional ) * * \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu * by marcel proust ( very optional ) * * don quijote * by cervantes ( also optional ) * * bikubesong * by frode grytten ( very norwegian ) * * the alchemist * by paulo coelho ( very possibly the worst book i have ever read ) also a considerable amount of poetry . 
  ** english class : ** * * romeo & juliet * by shakespeare * * animal farm * by george orwell * * 1984 * by george orwell english classes are somehow not centred around literature over here . 
  ** latin class : ** * * de bello gallico * by caesar * * in catilinam i * by cicero * * menaechmi * by plautus * * electra * by euripides also some horace , juvenal , martial , virgil and ovid . 
  you know . 
  that 's harsh , tbh, 
  seems probable . 
  they have been keeping him out of contact with others for several other reasons too , though . 
  my knowledge of america is pretty limited , but were i to judge from what i 've gathered , there 's a big difference . 
  let 's just say that using god as a political argument here would put you permanently out of business . 
  very . 
  it 's everywhere . 
  tv shows , movies , music , literature , everything mainly british or american . 
  we even follow your headless presidential election down to state level . 
  some things we do n't really care for , though . 
  classical music and art are still heavily european . 
  to be honest , i do n't like it . 
  i think it 's narrowing the culture and marginalising the language . 
  artists will sing in english , for instance , because norwegian is ` too small ' or ` too close ' . 
  i 've never done this , and i ca n't really think of many instances where i 've seen others do it . 
  never had problems with it . 
  no , i actually have n't , but i 'm very familiar with the story . 
  it 's one of the most important and well-known stories we have from the war , i reckon . 
  i think we 're not as good at this as we ought to . 
  it seems like the syllabus is oriented towards history made by norwegians more than history happening around these parts , so we focus on independence , worker movements and public debate more than wwii , for example . 
  mentioning pearl harbor , mentioning the bombs , and that 's pretty much it . 
  if you are n't interested , then that 's all you 'll ever get from public education . 
  but the eastern front is pretty poorly handled too , in my experience . 
  i guess there are a few things at play : 1 . 
  everything in norway is rather expensive compared to most other countries . 
  prices will naturally be higher in the capital than anywhere else ( though it certainly is n't cheap in other cities ) . 
  prices have been increasing ever since the early 90s , not even influenced a lot by ' 08 , and most importantly : 4 . 
  in oslo , there are regulations on where you can build stuff , so it 's illegal to build in recreational areas to the north , west and east ( mostly ) . 
  as of now , there are people living close to that limit all around the city , which means that you have to build where there are no regulations , meaning long travel times to the city centre . 
  so what is available more centrally will increase in price . 
  this is also why oslo is growing in a [ strange triangular shape ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@59.9075548,10.7143867,11z ) , not the more usual circular . 
  there 's also a real resistance against building in empty pockets in the inner parts , because people sure love their leisure space . 
  in oslo you 'd get a studio close to the city centre or in the west or a small family apartment in the eastern parts . 
  last year there was this hilarious case about a 10 square metre apartment sold for around # 120,000 . 
  i 'm not sure too many of us would be happy with calling him king of denmark . 
  did he finish the work for you guys ? 
  i 'm sorry to have let down everyone 's expectations . 
  i love the fact that norway technically extends further north , east , west and south than finland . 
  edit for funnier fact : in the 13th century , king haakon of norway gifted a polar bear to henry iii of england . 
  it was kept on a leash in the tower of london and swam in the thames . 
  i 've also heard ` venice of the north ' about arendal . 
  fishing is something you do with your grandfather . 
  everyone has done it a couple of times , most claim to like it , very few actually do it . 
  hunting is something you do if you 're from rural areas . 
  hunting deer , moose etc. 
  has always been a part of the culture , but nowadays many ( especially urban areas ) have never even seen a gun . 
  other outdoors activities include hiking in the summer ( been popular for probably a hundred years and increasingly so ) and skiing in the winter ( nov-apr ) , sometimes in the mountains , sometimes just around where you live . 
  an idiosyncrasy about us is it 's very common to have a cabin in the ( nuclear or extended ) family . 
  generally , you have one in the mountains if you live by the sea , and vice versa . 
  many use these as bases for outdoors activities . 
  this is how it works here as well . 
  bringing red wine is generally seen as a bad move for parties because of mess , and the white is often drunk from the bottle ( although some try to seem civilised by borrowing the host 's wine glasses ) . 
  drinking beer from a cup is just not worth it . 
  yes, 
  well , of course it depends , but i 'm mainly used to people bringing their own . 
  otherwise it 's just find whatever 's in the kitchen and try not breaking it . 
  the bottle ? 
  no , i agree . 
  the story seems to have formed from a fairly broad consensus . 
  what gives it away for me is that germany itself has worked very hard towards uncovering the truth . 
  details are mostly what 's left of contentious issues , it seems . 
   ... is viewed as history and therefore there is little to discuss . 
  he ca n't have been more than a few years old during the war , so he certainly was n't directly connected , but there are rumours that he sympathised with his father . 
  how true they are is hard to tell , as the villagers ' opinion was cemented a long time ago . 
  if they are , it 's quite understandable he 's become an outcast . 
  regardless , it 's astonishing how hard it can be to get rid of such a reputation . 
  no , not really . 
  taught extensively in schools , sometimes even a source of national pride ( though of course we did n't stand a chance ) . 
  the touchy issues i can think of is the quite voluntary deportation of jews by the police , and other instances of norwegian collaboration . 
  i do n't think anyone has held a grudge against germany for decades . 
  forgiving our own has been a lot worse . 
  in the village my family comes from , there is a guy most people avoid speaking to , because his father was a member of the nazi party . 
  i think it 's fundamentally wrong to talk about * all syrians * in the way you did . 
  many syrians came to europe before 2011 , and not all people coming to europe as refugees ( atm ) are from syria . 
  of course there are difficulties with integrating that many in such a short time , but i have absolute faith that we will get through it , as we have done plenty of times in the past . 
  incorrect . 
  not to mention that it works relatively well right now . 
  in norway i 'm only in contact with cash when relatives give me money for christmas . 
  otherwise i try to avoid having it . 
  here in the uk i feel like it 's still necessary to keep cash on me , especially when paying small amounts in stores . 
  some shops have a lower limit for card payments , which i ca n't remember having encountered in norway . 
  i like it . 
  hopefully it 'll be everywhere soon . 
  football , skiing ( nordic and biathlon , and also downhill ) and probably handball , but it really depends on what time of year and in what year . 
  for example , there was a bit of a fencing craze during the london olympics .
