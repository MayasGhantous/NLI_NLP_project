it 's still leagues better than voice over . 
  i once had the joyful experience of getting polish tv through my cables and watching famous shows like friends or mac gyver with that same , tired polish voice over was something straight out of dystopia . 
  probably not gon na happen . 
  these incentives are currently being investigated by the eu/eec for interrupting competition . 
  norway might have to abort them . 
  not to mention you pass toll roads for free , can use the bus/taxi lanes on highways and get easier parking with free chargers . 
  it is quite a bargain . 
  i guess so . 
  if you look at the used car classifieds , the [ teslas go for about the same price ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/car/used/result?sort=0&amp;keyword=tesla+model+s ) as the new cars . 
  it says something about the temperature in the market . 
  it 's ridiculous how popular that car is here . 
  not overall , no . 
  but every month a shipment comes in , it tops that month . 
  female genital mutilation is barbaric , male genital mutilation sacred . 
  need any polish for that mirror ? 
  i had a feeling i had read about something on this matter . 
  i think it might have been the [ pied-noirs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pieds_noirs ) . 
  so you 're right . 
  it seems france is very eager to grant citizenship to immigrants , however : `` france accepts about 200,000 legal immigrants each year . '', 
  and `` in 2008 , france granted citizenship to 137,000 persons '' . 
  ex-colonials have french passports , non ? 
  and peanuts are [ beans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peanut ) . 
  if it was overpriced , you 'd buy someone else 's oil . 
  [ we are ] ( http://www.dr.dk/tv/se/detektor-tv/detektor-68#!/ ) . 
  jump to 8:40 . 
  we pay eu just about the same as the brits per capita . 
  without the benefits . 
  i 'm norwegian and would also like to know . 
  american microbrewing surpassed british quite a while ago . 
  you should really try some of _ their _ ales , 
  it turned into a bad sitcom . 
  could n't watch it anymore . 
  i hope it will return to the good side soon and that this will somehow be announced so i 'll get the memo . 
  but until then i 'll leave it . 
  it 's about time muslims got their [ life of brian ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exwfh6sgyso ) . 
  all caps off !, 
  finally i must mention our sense of humor . 
  it 's so confusing natives ca n't detect it from serious lectures . 
  when someone is making a joke it can be perceived as pure educational fact delivery and when the president speaks , everybody laughs . 
  no , they 're not . 
  they just ... sit there . 
  trying hard to be deep and all , but not really fooling anyone . 
  i forgot : the population is undereducated , monolingual and intolerant as fuck . 
  well most of it is , that is . 
  tourists . 
  the exact wording might have been a little different , it 's twenty years ago , but with pointing to a pile of salami with a price tag with a number and the letters `` hg '' next to the franc symbol , i actually did expect her to at least try to make sense of what i was fluttering about . 
  yes . 
  i actually desperately tried this at the market in paris while on interrail back in the 90s . 
  had little time before the train left for norway ( well , hamburg , but we were heading home due to a drained budget ) and could not for the bare life of me get the woman behind the counter to understand that i wanted a hectogram of any of her salamis or hams . 
  resorted to this pseudo-french accent thing ... and it worked !, 
  was her reply , all smiles . 
  later got the technique confirmed a lot of times . 
  works in italy too . 
  norway is overpriced/overcrowded/underwhelming and has bad weather to top it off . 
  do n't come here !, 
  what 's that ? 
  a blonde ... over there in the forest ... yes !, 
  there just over the border !, 
  she 's calling you !, 
  go to sweden instead . 
  they have inga . 
  and m\u00f6\u00f6se . 
  i find speaking english with a heavy french-like accent works too . 
  in particular when you do n't know any actual french . 
  if there 's pictures of the food , continue walking . 
  you never know . 
  it 's a joke , really . 
  the one , warm and sunny day , i would think . 
  mark your calendar . 
  denmark stole those islands from us . 
  sincerely , the norwegians . 
  as an on-paper idealistically supporter of a functioning european union and a pragmatic nay-saying norwegian , i can only stand behind the question being begged here . 
  edit : also keep in mind : [ esc ] ( http://www.eurovision.tv ), 
  yes . 
  but i prefer them being collapsed into single units . 
  it 's correct , albeit in a schwarzenegger manner : brutal and without grasping the meaning . 
  my word means i dare challenge you at a safe distance , and is normally used only by young teenagers . 
  it is also a construct of three words , like google suggests , and makes my point that english is a simplistic language . 
  yes , and you should by no means listen to my bullshit . 
  i make most of this up . 
  just checked , and it seems `` deck '' is a rather new word . 
  dutch even . 
  it might be we got that one from them at the time you got it . 
  ceiling is `` tak '' . 
  i guess `` dekke '' would be derived from `` zudecken '' , as we have the same word , `` tildekke '' . 
  or maybe the other way around , as the `` dekke '' would be the item with what you were `` tildekke '' . 
  at sea , we have the word `` dekk '' , meaning the outdoor flooring . 
  on cars and other rubber wheeled items of transport , the same word means `` tyre/tire '' . 
  we say `` dekk ! '', 
  to our dogs to make them lie down too . 
  '' - now you see me ! , now you do n't ! '', 
  '' - uhm , yes ? '', 
  we call that `` skydekke '' . 
  `` dekke '' means cover or blanket , making the word `` cloud blanket '' . 
  but it 's long and was probably too difficult for the one-word-at-a-time brits , so they cut of the redundant part and made the word apply for everything between them and the heavens . 
  ... because it 's always cloudy . 
  i can verify it 's rather easy to understand swedish and danish as a norwegian . 
  there are norwegian dialects that are harder . 
  danish is similar in writing but impossible in speach : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk danes attempting norwegian : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tw49lk2ghw&amp;f, 
  to top that , the nok is skyrocketing after the swiss tied their franc to the euro and the norwegian currency became a safe haven .
