considering erdogan is not a german citizen , how would german laws even apply to him ? 
  had the `` crime '' happened in turkey , i could understand ( even though i would ' t agreed ), 
  and they would have saved tax money , that could have been used on more important stuff, 
  i envy you for your roads !, 
  they are amazing, 
  well , have you seen our roads ? 
  til norway is not in europe, 
  yeah we are facing economic crisis true . 
  and that is yet another reason why we ca n't afford mass immigration . 
  luckily , kebab is a turkish dish , 
  yes i have , and history have unfortunately proved me right , time after time . 
  and still , most the cultures you listed there are way closer the western european culture then the arabic culture . 
  i 'll take 100 poles rather then 1 arab . 
  that 's because sweden , like many other european countries teach english from primary school and up . 
  so most people 50 years or younger will be mostly fluent in english, 
  where did you go wrong dear neighbours ? 
  yup exactly . 
  yes exactly what i said . 
  `` ja vi elsker dette lander '' is the unofficial `` official '' anthem that everybody uses . 
  but it is in fact not official . 
  yeah , just for fun though . 
  scandinaves are like best buddies who shows their love for each other by talking shit to each others . 
  we have a category of jokes in norway called `` swedish jokes '' where we just make fun of swedes . 
  and the swedes do the same . 
  `` ja vi elsker dette landet '' is actually not the official song . 
  it is the de facto anthem , sung on sporting events , but it was actually never considered official . 
  `` s\u00f8nner av norge '' is the true official anthem in norway, 
  in norway `` ja vi elsker dette landet '' is the de facto national anthem . 
  but the official anthem , `` s\u00f8nner av norge '' does in fact not mention the word `` blood '', 
  in norway we have * [ hell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hell,_norway ) * [ hamburgersmauet ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/place/nedre+hamburgersmauet,+bergen/@60.3957133,5.3256644,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x463cfea7cac39b01:0x4b95f05d824e647e ) ( hamburger alleyway ) * [ mikrob\u00f8lgen ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/place/mikrob\u00f8lgen,+oslo/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x46416f36666a3d5b:0x7c4c8aaf97270935?sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjrn6ws59llahvljxikhxxccceq8geivjak ) ( the microwave ) * [ komediebakken ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/place/komediebakken,+5010+bergen/@60.3922162,5.3139112,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x463cfc0309baf83b:0x715076410952613e ) ( comedy slope ) * [ krinkelkroken ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/place/krinkelkroken,+5014+bergen/@60.3908466,5.3208682,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x463cfea9d993fcef:0x2f57cc967eb064df ) ( nooks and crannies ) * [ p\u00f8lsesvingen ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/place/p\u00f8lsesvingen,+4012+stavanger/@58.9595914,5.7446943,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x463a353b5f8f89d3:0x5b6fb4cf6264f60f ) ( sausage turn/bend ) * [ syreveien ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/place/syreveien,+4015+stavanger/@58.9643745,5.7596463,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x463a3526290b7895:0x275d0e518b5c9b4f ) ( acid road ) * [ r\u00f8vsholen ] ( http://kart.gulesider.no/s\u00f8k/volda-r\u00f8vsholen ) ( ass cave ), 
  sorry , towns might have been the wrong word . 
  i meant areas like malm\u00f6 etc. 
  in sweden you have several towns that has become like that . 
  shits fucked up, 
  [ mfw ] ( http://imgur.com/disrzpz ) i realize that i live in norway, 
  i totally agree . 
  when breivik did his attacks in norway , many people was immediatly talking about all kinds of violent things . 
  luckily , he got a fair trial , and i hope this terrorist get it too . 
  that is what separate us from them, 
  thats the american way . 
  luckily , we are more civilized here in europe ( for the most part ) . 
  a death penalty would actually be doing him a service . 
  imagine how shitty it must be to live in total isolation for the rest of your life, 
  sorry if i am being ignorant . 
  but from watching the tv broadcast , how come it seems like there is a muslim ghetto there ? 
  how could this even happen ? 
  jesus christ mate , you need help, 
  why do you call me a racist ? 
  i have said nothing racist , and you have no reason to be rude . 
  what racism are you talking about ? 
  have i said anything to offend you ? 
  how dare you insult people by calling them racists ? 
  do you even know the definition of the word racism ? 
  surprise , `` eastern european '' is not a `` race '' . 
  it is sad that you feel like that . 
  i do n't think the west hates the east . 
  i think it 's more of a case of misunderstanding . 
  russia especially scares many western countries with their politics . 
  that does n't mean that we hate russia , or any other eastern countries , it just means that we do n't like the russian government for the way it leads it 's country . 
  latvia is an exciting country !, 
  i visited riga a couple of years ago , beautiful city , 
  maybe the swedish government wakes up soon ? 
  mostly tourists i would guess . 
  amsterdam is the party capital of europe, 
  how about heroin ? 
  i have heard that bergen , norway might be one of the `` heroin capitals '' of europe, 
  til only 5.5 % of europeans are female, 
  i think most countries have skeletons in their closets . 
  does n't mean they ca n't be proud of it 's history anyway . 
  `` those who do n't know history are doomed to repeat it '', 
  nothing in particular . 
  just used wikipedias europe map . 
  my bad !, 
  i just used wikipedias europe map as a base . 
  cyprus is `` kypros '' in norwegian, 
  / r/softwaregore, 
  regarding point 2 , i do n't know . 
  the drugs are just as expensive , but since the government pays most of it ( from tax money ) , we do n't notice . 
  what we have to pay is mostly just a symbolic sum . 
  the drug companies ends up with just as much though . 
  * prescriptions are relatively cheap , the state subsidized it heavily . 
  regular drugs are also relatively cheap . 
  * yes . 
  in norway everyone gets assigned a gp . 
  if you do n't like that gp , you are free to change doctor once a year . 
  i have always been treated well . 
  * absolutely . 
  it is awesome to never have to be afraid to get sick . 
  if i feel bad one day , i just call in sick , contact my doctor , and get the help i need . 
  in norway , you can be away from work up to 4 days with pay . 
  if you still are not better , your doctor will put you on sick leave , and the state will cover your lost income . 
  * sorry , i do n't have any experience with us healthcare . 
  in norway we watch it every 23rd december , weird i know , but traditions man ... 
  great !, 
  i hope many more countries follows switzerland 's example, 
  if this is true , how the hell did turkey even manage to warn russia `` 10 times '' before shooting ? 
  do they want to start ww3 ? 
  because this is how you start ww3 :(, 
  but , if it affects turkish individuals , maybe they would rise up against erdogan . 
  we ( the western countries ) are basically doing the same against russia , and it too affects the russian individuals , even though it 's the government we really want to `` punish '',
