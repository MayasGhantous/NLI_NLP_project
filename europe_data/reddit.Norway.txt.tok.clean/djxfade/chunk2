  russia is also part of europe, 
  no , not at all since 2004, 
  yup . 
  same here . 
  we get only the downside of the eu , and none of the benefits . 
  its stupid, 
  technically only sweden , denmark and norway are part of [ scandinavia ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavia ) . 
  but we still love you iceland, 
  great !, 
  one down , many to go . 
  the sooner the better, 
  we would always have [ schengen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area ) anyways , so the eu is not really neccessary for open borders . 
  afraid of russia ? 
  join nato :p i do n't think russa fears the eu . 
  yeah ... 
  i 'm from the only scandinavian country that is not a eu member . 
  i know that most norwegian 's are eu sceptic because they are afraid of jobs that would dissapear ( farms , fishing etc ) , because they would ` nt be able to compete with other eu countries . 
  me personal would love for norway to become a eu member , but mostly just because of all the benefits regarding cheaper goods , and an `` umlimited '' duty free quota . 
  aah , those where the days , amirite ? 
  great !, 
  haha :p, 
  it 's disgusting . 
  why the hell should germans be haunted by their past ? 
  the word nazi belongs to the past . 
  no one alive today can be blamed for what happened that time, 
  ylvis ( what does the fox say ? ) . 
  i cross my fingers for you, 
  til : norway is a uninhabited country in europe, 
  welcome to sweden ... 
  i totally agree . 
  sadly in norway i ca n't say what i mean , because then i am a `` racist '' ... 
  it 's hopeless, 
  im getting real tired of this shit . 
  if you move or migrate to another country , you should adapt to the local customs and culture , not the other way around , poor woman . 
  yeah , that one is an embarrassment for us . 
  i actually thought we where just as early as you guys, 
  it 's from the cult movie `` euro trip '' :p http://nb.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fl\u00dcgg\u00c5\u04d8nk\u0431\u20ac\u010chi\u0152\u00df\u00d8l\u012e\u00can, 
   has norway been in any conflict since ww2 yes , un and nato operations , like bosnia , afghanistan etc. 
  but primarily for peace keeping purposes, 
  as a bergenser , you have my vote . 
  yes that is correct . 
  on paper everyone must do the service , the last few decades ot has decreased, 
  also note that in norway there is conscription . 
  all people above 18 has to serve 1 year in the army/navy/airforce . 
  so almost all males have undergone basic training . 
  recently conscription also became mandatory for girls . 
  yeah , he probably played the violent pokemon go or minecraft, 
  and the home of paulaner , my favourite wei\u00dfbier !, 
  it 's the same in norway . 
  suicides are rarely covered , to protection the family left behind, 
  same thing happened at an army base in norway . 
  the local hells angels broke in an got away with several fully automatic rifles, 
  nope , that has nothing to do with this . 
  they can still observe the source and destination ip , and they have the timestamps, 
  just like the us, 
  norway here . 
  https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/bibelbeltet#norge we do have that . 
  mostly in the south , and south-west . 
  bergen ( the major city in western norway is an exception from this ), 
  not in norway . 
  even the poorest people have the same access to public healthcare and education as you . 
  private clinics and schools does not count . 
  i have been in dublin , 10/10 would recommend !, 
  nicests people i have ever met, 
  excuse me ? 
  yeah , i am sick and tired of the abuse of the word `` racist '', 
  it is n't racist to wish immigrants to go back their own country . 
  it is n't racist to want to stop immigration . 
  it is racist to wish black people back to their own country . 
  it is racist to deny jewish people to immigrate . 
  and also , islam is a religion , not a `` race '' . 
   the uk is still within ** nato ** and the un ftfy, 
  this ^, 
  i hereby appologize to britain for the viking raids , on behalf of all norwegians, 
  yes they did , and they paid the price for it . 
  germany has gone all out at offering their appologies . 
  germany took full responsiblity for it . 
  great !, 
  greece needs this . 
  hmm , that is really interesting . 
  i was always told otherwise . 
  but , what did we make money from before the oil ? 
  well , it 's not wrong, 
  norway , ice hockey ? 
  what about all the various ski sports ? 
  `` norway is a swedish city '', 
  you had one job germany ... good job . 
  i suggest that as many people as possible , gathers and performs a public reading of it . 
  i think this might be related to the antenna sabotages that happened recently .

  sorry to be `` that guy '' , but europe is a continent , eu is the union . 
  we are not celebrating the liberation after ww2 , we are celebrating our independence day , the day the norwegian constitution was written, 
  i have only listed the countries that i know have a different name in norwegian . 
  * austria - \u00d8sterriket * belarus - hviterussland * belgium - belgia * croatia - kroatia * cyrpus - kypros * czech republic - tsjekkia * denmark - danmark * estonia - estland * france - frankrike * ** germany - tyskland ** * greenland - gr\u00f8nnland * hungary - ungarn * iceland - island * ireland - irland * lithuania - litauen * macedonia - makedonia * moldova - moldovia * netherlands - nederland * norway - norge * poland - polen * russia - russland * scotland - skottland * spain - spania * sweden - sverige * switzerland - sveits * turkey - tyrkia * ukraine - ukraina * vatican city - vatikan staten, 
  heey , we use stammkneipe too !, 
  at least in bergen . 
  i wonder how that would look like if all european countries where included, 
  the longer they avoid it , the worse the problem will become, 
  why the hell is n't anything done about it ? 
  cat = mjau dog = voff cow = m\u00f8 sheep = b\u00e6 duck = kvakk,
