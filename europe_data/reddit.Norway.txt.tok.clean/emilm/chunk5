  it 's not only interest rates either , but also a ton of other policies , like forcing banks to lend out to customers that could not otherwise get a mortgage and so on . 
   the hoarding comes from individuals who want to save money , cause  they think that future prospects are not so bright . 
  individuals do not save money , cause they think that they can influence prices with it that 's what any responsible person would do . 
   or they are calculating that the money will gain value in the future no . 
   why . 
  if you see that money loses value due to more money being on the market , you will be more likely to spend it . 
  why is that a good thing if it 's not purposeful ? 
   why would that happen , tho ? 
  you do not give out money for free , your are lending money to the banks for  low/negative interest . 
  so only people who need/want money will borrow it . 
  this is what i am talking about : misallocations in the economy , bubbles etc. 
  it 's a boom/bust cycle created by this train of thought . 
  money is very very cheap . 
  the cheaper the money is , the more risks people take . 
  and that 's what 's happened . 
  if you compare , maybe , but http://www.nationaldebtclocks.org/debtclock/spain -  99 % of gdp is not good . 
  and yes it has everything to do with greece . 
  both countries have spent more money than they can afford . 
  in a keynes world it is a nasty problem . 
  but in a healthy economy it would n't be . 
  it would just mean that people got more productive . 
  no , it forces people to invest , and often it ends up being bad investments because the money are so cheap . 
  how 's that working for europe ? 
  the economy has been `` boosted '' by low interest rates for a long time , but sooner or later you will hit a wall . 
  inflation / money printing leads to huge misallocations in the economy and can allow a bloated public sector to live . 
  once it tries to clean itself up , or slows down , you will get deflationary effect . 
  because it rewards spending and punishes saving and production . 
  the value of money is watered out .

  you know you have a screwed system when you `` need more money printing '', 
  source ? 
  and i would like a historical one from 1950/69ish-present, 
  in short - they consume more than they produce !, 
  and faking numbers and loaning money lets them continue doing that . 
  and that is true for a lot of countries . 
  that is not what a government should be doing . 
  i am talking about what got greece in the hole to begin with - debt !, 
  they got goldman-sachs to forge fake numbers to get more loan than they should have . 
  and it 's not only greece , but portugal , spain etc etc. 
  it 's like `` if those people can do it , then i can '' , and it spreads like cancer . 
  methaphorically speaking : there is no nice way to get a drug addict to go cold turkey . 
  no , it is really that simple . 
  you simply do n't spend money you do n't have , and certainly not money you ca n't pay back . 
  true , and it shows how violently it grows without them . 
  even they could n't stop the spending ... 
  of course they say this , they have to defend their own policy of endless money printing . 
  yes, 
  funds ? 
  what funds ? 
  i thought the * whole point * of reddit is to be an * alternative * to mainstream media among other things ... good luck waiting for a mainstream media to report it ... 
  you can appeal , the flair is now `` removed - lacking credible source and low quality '' . 
  now you have the `` credible source '' and low quality = ? 
  thanks . 
  so it 's not a `` forged '' video . 
  the dangers of sharing from the `` wrong '' youtube account . 
  i have been there , 
  did you find that video there from them ? 
  ok i traced the video to the fb page `` f ** k you im from skaune '' . 
  in the description it says this : `` the video is part of a global campaign launched on april 15th 2016 entitled , `` muslim youth : pioneers of real change '' and organised by the women 's section in the central media office of hizb ut tahrir that seeks to address the identity crisis facing many muslim youth internationally today . '', 
  right , so let 's find this site . 
  https://www.youtube.com/user/therevivalproduction/videos the swedish one is nowhere to be found . 
  someone must have gone through a great deal of effort to fake the video since the intro etc is identical . 
  here 's a `` legit '' uk example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txkdvpnhjh4 - pretty similar message !, 
  it 's stupid if it 's a setup , no other sources ? 
  does that change the video though ? 
   i alle \u00e5r ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoouy4p4ray denne forklarer i detalj om hvordan velferdssystemet i usa fungerer . 
  men i de aller aller fleste tilfeller s\u00e5 er private alternativer soleklart best . 
  usa er intet eksempel p\u00e5 et fritt marked . 
  hvilke lovlige alternativer eksisterte det ? 
  nope . 
  for \u00e5 sette det p\u00e5 spissen . 
  la oss si at du er slave . 
  du kan le , men det er faktum !, 
  i am not opposed to healthy environment , it 's just like idiots like `` mrjonas '' think that i am opposed to something that 's not a law . 
  too bad the constitution we celebrate has been butchered recently . 
  i totally agree , 
  i am just saying that since they have in-group preferences and the west does n't , they will gradually influence our society and not the other way around . 
  which is obviously happen if you take a look around . 
  it 's always about europeans having to adapt to them by having separated pools etc. 
  imagine having 2 football teams . 
  where team a only pass to their own , and team b pass to the other team sometimes . 
  who is likely to win ? 
  are you high ? 
  look what 's happening in europe . 
  they stick to their own . 
  yes exactly !, 
  the point is that they do n't welcome other cultures warmly and prefer their own . 
  so within these countries you have factions and movements of islam which oppose eachother . 
  not even within their own countries they are friendly to diverging cultures and views . 
  mostly all other cultures than the modern western one . 
  ethnocentrism is natural . 
  it 's biological and human nature . 
  acting against it by forcing multiculturaism through government programs is immoral when it acts against what 's natural for us . 
  using force itself is immoral . 
  depends what morals you have but that 's another discussion . 
  i am just saying that what we have now is clearly not working well with parallel societies . 
  even 2 villages in the same country europe may view eachother as strangers . 
  the statement is still true though . 
  labeling the expression as `` far-right '' does n't make the glaring problem go away .
