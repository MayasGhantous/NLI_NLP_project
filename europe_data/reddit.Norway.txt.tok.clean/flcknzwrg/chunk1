fjords and mountains help , 
  that was n't what i was thinking about tbh - norway is infinitely more beautiful . 
  houses and certainly apartments are smaller though ( just my gutfeel , i have lived in both countries ) . 
  i think the german health care system overall performs better , although it admittedly comes with more inequality . 
  other than that ... nothing major comes to mind . 
  which is n't to say that germany does worse in all other respects . 
  ca n't think of any in norway :-(, 
  we need a language everyone can use , and english seems to be it . 
  i can count myself lucky that 's it in my native language 's family , that made it easy to learn for me , 
  danish , hands down . 
  granted , it 's hard to understand for me ( german immigrant in norway ) , but it sounds hilarious and nice at the same time . 
  like norwegian , spoken while having a potato in the mouth , according to norwegians . 
  legend has it that danes ca n't even understand each other . 
  never heard of money being a purely capitalist concept either . 
  troms\u00f8 , northern norway - the statue of king olav was painted red by `` russ '' - kids who soon finish school and do stupid stuff for a couple of weeks every spring . 
  - people fear that gypsies will again camp beneath one of the city 's bridges . 
  after this being an issue last year , many people are wary of them . 
  as a related news item , the populist right wing seems to be happy to agitate against beggars - it 's election year after all . 
  - a regional airline ( wider\u00f8e ) was struck by a worker 's strike . 
  as a consequence , postal deliveries might be delayed . 
  - a swimming elk delayed a ferry landing nearby so , not that much happening at the moment . 
  i think the people are gearing up for the national day ceremonies on the 17. , and summer is not far . 
  the weather is splendid , and we are busy getting sunburned , 
  troms\u00f8 in northern norway here . 
  we had unusually ( though not exceptionally ) much snowfall and lots of avalanches lately . 
  some people died in avalanches because they were stupid , spurring public discussion about safety when being out and about in the mountains . 
  also , a road connecting a part of the island i 'm living on had to be closed for almost two weeks because a series of huge avalanches buried it in several meters of snow . 
  it opened again this afternoon . 
  politically , the local government is divided and threatened to fall apart because one ruling party ( h\u00f8yre , the conservatives ) agreed with the sami parliament ( representation of indigenous people from the european arctic , living partly in norway ) to collaborate more in the future . 
  the party that rules troms\u00f8 together with h\u00f8yre , the right wing populist fremskrittspartiet ( progress party ) is not amused about this and basically threatens divorce . 
  posnania is a horse . 
  they are after him, 
  run, 
  still does n't matter , does it ? 
  i bet you can configure these things to either only ask for your pin , or ask you for amount of money first . 
  does it matter ? 
  all card terminals i have ever used in restaurants and such ask me to type in the amount of money i want to pay , and all card terminals i have ever used in supermarkets do n't do that ... 
  i have to do no such thing at , say , the supermarket . 
  so , no , this is not an issue . 
  i am with you , it is a disgusting practice . 
  i 'd much rather do away with that . 
  but people here still tip , and it is expected of people to do so . 
   there is no tipping culture in norway why , then , do i have to type in the amount of money i want to pay in a restaurant / caf\u00e9 myself ? 
  i agree that we do n't have as much of a `` tipping culture '' as , say , the germans , but still ...  there has never been a implicit contract between consumers and businesses in norway that they the former * should pay a part of the emplyees salary through tipping * . 
  that much is correct , i did n't mean to imply anything different . 
  ( i added the emphasis here ) . 
  i do , however , still say that it is bad manners to not tip anything . 
  as you say , good service should be rewarded , and i think it is expected of the customer to do so . 
  me neither , before i moved to norway . 
  top voted comment says you do n't tip in germany ? 
  i grew up in germany , and i can tell you that while you do n't need to tip much , not tipping at all for example in a restaurant is just rude . 
  huh ? 
  when you pay with your card at a restaurant or caf\u00e9 , you usually type in the amount you want to pay yourself . 
  that , my friend , is where you are supposed to tip . 
  it 's not a must ( the waiters do n't depend on tips as much as they do elsewhere ) , but i would say it 's rude to not tip anything when the service was good . 
  as for how much ? 
  i usually round up to something in the area of 5-10 % . 
  if i got bad service , i tip less or nothing . 
  edit : who do i tip ? 
  restaurants , caf\u00e9s , pizza delivery guys , that sort of thing . 
  i do n't think i tip anywhere else ( like taxis or doctors ) - usually you do n't even have the option to do so : we pay most things with card , and when there is no option to type in the amount you want to pay , there 's no possibility for tipping . 
  it 's a great dane i guess ... 
  he could at least have painted a pair of skis or something . 
  just ... something . 
  i am disappoint . 
  good point !, 
  edited my post . 
  you 'll find many clips on youtube . 
  there also seem to be complete ( ? ), 
  airings available . 
  i did n't check , because i. . . ca n't , but here 's the link for you : http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=videos&amp;search_query=musikantenstadl&amp;search_duration=long&amp;uni=3 edit : do n't click the first search result , it 's not the real thing . 
  the real thing is a major tv production . 
  edit 2 : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmjhuibzooa here , this will do . 
  nobody has recommended a norwegian game show yet , so here is the only one i know that is sometimes actually funny : * `` 71 grader nord '' * ( `` 71 degrees north '' ) . 
  it 's sporty people doing sporty things mostly in the norwegian wilderness . 
  and while we 're at it : google * `` lars monsen '' * . 
  he 's the norwegian bear grylls , except he does n't drink piss and he 's of course much better . 
  he made several different nature programmes / shows / entertaining `` documentaries '' . 
  another noteable ( ? ), 
  norwegian production ( not game show ) is * `` lilyhammer '' * . 
  it 's about an italian american mafia guy ( played by an actor from `` the sopranos '' ) who is exiled to lillehammer , norway . 
  it 's semi-funny at best sometimes , but there are lots of funny norwegian stereotypes in it . 
  as a plus , much of it is in english . 
  edit : pmatthew8 points out that i should include `` hurtigruten - minutt for minutt '' . 
  it 's the complete trip of one of our coastal steamers , all the way from bergen in the southwest to kirkenes near the russian border . 
  71something hours of madness . 
  and you can watch it all for free online !, 
  here : http://nrk.no/hurtigruten/, 
  i grew up in ** germany ** , so here are a few recommendations . 
  since others have already pointed you to scripted productions like crime series , let me add some actual shows as in `` game show '' or `` talk show '' - there are some very popular ones that do , i believe , convey lots of ... well ... german-ness . 
  * `` wetten , dass ... '' * ( `` i bet that ... '' ) - used to be the by far most successful `` saturday evening live show '' in german television for several decades . 
  it 's mostly older people watching it now . 
  * `` schlag den raab '' * ( `` beat stefan raab '' ) - a rare example of a more recent game show that has actually been invented in germany and not licensed and adapted from somewhere else . 
  * `` hart aber fair '' * ( `` hard but fair '' ) - one of the most important political talk shows . 
  it always strikes me as very ( present-day ) german . 
  in an altogether rather good way . 
  the downside to all of these shows is that you will probably not find subtitles for any of them ... but here 's a bonus . 
  it 's also all german , but it is so * whacky * you can probably `` enjoy '' it even if you do n't understand a single word : ** `` musikantenstadl '' ** . 
  you have been warned . 
  will you join us ?
