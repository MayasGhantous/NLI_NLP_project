yes . 
  i teach high school . 
  one year there were two boys in one of my classes who had a crush on a girl in another class . 
  they did n't know her name , so they 'd just call her `` the pretty muslim girl in [ class ] '' . 
  i finally figured out who they meant , and pointed out that she almost always wore a necklace with a cross on it - which had to mean she was christian . 
  but she was african , you see , and they just assumed all africans are muslim . 
  it used to be `` grekenland '' , and the change is fairly recent - 1960s or '70s maybe ? 
  and the cars pulling camping trailers are all on norwegian roads , primarily those clearly marked on maps , `` camping trailers not recommended '' . 
  ah , but not all of those young swedes are totally jobless . 
  a lot of them are just working at a coffee shop in oslo for a year , to gain a little experience ... 
  and `` london derriere '' is n't funny ? 
  you were ten years old once , were n't you ? 
  how do you know that * is n't * an oil rig ? 
  the waves in the north sea get pretty nasty ... 
  danes are just happier , drunker norwegians . 
  you must watch it . 
  as it happens , the psychology class i taught this year had just finished learning about propaganda the week before christmas break . 
  i showed them `` joyeux noel '' and to start with they were all checking their phones and acting bored , the way high school students usually are when they know this movie wo n't be on the test . 
  by the end the phones had all gone dark and there were many sniffling sounds around the room . 
  it 's a beautiful story and well told . 
  yeah , but your economy would collapse without half the population of norway popping over to buy cheap chicken filets . 
  if we get a few hours ' notice , we could quietly evacuate the whole country anyway . 
  ... and the song spoke to a lot of people who have felt like outcasts and freaks , and lived to tell the tale . 
  the fact that it felt like giving the middle finger to a rising tide of intolerance in some parts of the continent was of course a bonus . 
  the beard is real , the eyelashes are not . 
  conchita wurst is the performance alter ego of tom neuwirth . 
  the body you see on stage is male . 
  for the spirit inside that body ... the situation is more complicated . 
  aww , poor france . 
  i thought the song was entertaining ... 
  it would normally be illegal in norway , too . 
  for some reason no one reacted to the unmarked butter . 
  it was a `` crisis '' , after all . 
  fixed , thanks !, 
  reduced supply , increased demand , and inflexible agricultural policy . 
  lightly sprinkled with panic buying . 
  reduced supply : the weather was awful that year , so the crops that were supposed to feed the dairy cows basically got rained out . 
  farmers were buying lower-quality feed to supplement it , and as a result the milk had a slightly lower fat content . 
  that meant less milk fat to use for butter . 
  increased ~ ~ supply ~ ~ demand : tine , the dairy farmers ' cooperative , blamed `` low carb diets '' , for some reason . 
  it appears that the increased demand had more to do with norwegians having more disposable income , thus not feeling they had to buy cheaper margarine rather than butter ( especially for christmas baking ) , more people choosing to bake their christmas cookies at home ( as baking your own had become fashionable ) , and perhaps most important , margarine no longer being seen as the healthier alternative . 
  it 's important to note that margarine was easy to find during the entire time . 
  agricultural policy : norwegian agricultural policy makes it somewhere between difficult and impossible to import dairy products other than cheese . 
  at first the government , with the backing of the farmers ' cooperatives , was n't going to lower tariffs on butter at all . 
  eventually the government figured they had to , but dairy companies elsewhere in europe were skeptical about selling to norway , when they figured the tariffs would go right back up as soon as christmas was over . 
  ( and they were right . ), 
  panic buying : people see signs in supermarkets `` limit two per customer '' , they figure , `` i better buy it then ! '', 
  a lot of norway 's butter supply ended up in people 's freezers , hoarded against a shortage that the panic buying had helped to create . 
  as for me ... 
  i knew which supermarket in my area had the best imported foods section , therefore the best connections with suppliers in other countries . 
  i went there and , sure enough , they had their cold case full of french butter even when other nearby stores were empty . 
  i do n't know much french , but a clerk told me which was salted and which was unsalted , and i bought what i needed for my christmas baking , and went home feeling very smug indeed . 
  five minute walk from my front door to the light rail station . 
  if i 'm feeling very lazy or the weather is very bad , i can also take a bus for two stops . 
  twelve minute ride on light rail . 
  ten minute walk from the light rail station to the school where i teach . 
  quite a few of the pupils at the school are on the same route , so i keep an eye peeled for signs of bullying or other problems . 
  i rarely see anything interesting - everyone is usually half-awake and focused on getting to class on time . 
  if i decide to drive , the whole thing takes about fifteen minutes . 
  those trees took more than a day to grow . 
  in terms of number of people who die or need to be hospitalized , that would be the wasp , due to allergic reactions . 
  boring , i know . 
  other than the polar bears on svalbard , norway 's big animals mostly stay away from people . 
  yep , we have bears and wolves , but not many , and they mostly prefer prey that does n't fight back . 
  big herbivores like moose and musk oxen can ruin your day , too , but most of the time you really have to scare or provoke them . 
  basically , nature kills unwary people in norway , but usually because they 're doing something they should n't . 
  walking off cliffs ( * how do you do this ?!? 
  * ) , drowning , base jumping off places that are off-limits precisely because they 're dangerous , getting too close to the edge of a glacier that 's about to calve . 
  so what would you suggest ? 
  a separate set of laws ? 
  because you have the current world champion . 
  i suppose it would be in bad taste to ask if the earth moved . 
  copying my reply from / r/askreddit , because it applies here , too - eur300 ,000 is more than usd300 ,000 , but a search reveals the same thing : i live in b\u00e6rum township , in what we can call greater oslo . 
  what you will find in this area for ~ ~ us$ ~ ~ eur300k would be one-bedroom or studio apartments , possibly something a bit larger if you look further from the city or are willing to do some renovation and redecorating work , or ideally both . 
  [ example of a nice , though small , one-bedroom apartment in a pleasant neighborhood for the specified price .

  both these places are in the southeastern part of the city , not exactly the most fashionable district , and quite a commute to the areas where most people work . 
  plenty of apartments , too , of course , but i was looking specifically for things that were house-like though not actually houses . 
  i teach english as a foreign language in high school . 
  i 'd give these two men a pretty average grade . 
  nearly the same in norwegian except for small spelling changes : forglemmegei . 
  as an english speaker who learned norwegian as an adult , i found that word remarkably hard to learn to say without sounding like an idiot . 
  never eat at a place called mom 's , never play cards with a man named doc , and never fight on the side of a guy who 's been exiled to an island once already . 
  the orkneys and the shetlands . 
  both were norwegian , both came under the rule of denmark when the rest of norway did , and both were pawned by christian i of denmark when he could n't pay the dowry for his daughter when she married the james iii of scotland . 
  since he never redeemed them , they passed to the scottish crown . 
  so as with so many other things in norwegian history , it 's clearly all denmark 's fault . 
  yeah , well , we were n't the ones who decided that backing napoleon sounded like a good idea . 
  and just maybe , if your kings had n't been so awful for so many years , it might have all worked out in spite of that little mistake . 
  today most of the russ are more hungover than still drunk . 
  though not all as badly as [ this guy . 
  the difference : guinea pigs are n't very bright , but they are social and affectionate creatures . 
  hamsters are just neurotic little assholes . 
  i thought it was a tablecloth . 
  plus we 'd have sweden surrounded . 
  and we 'd whip their butt at every winter olympics . 
  let 's do this thing !, 
  we ca n't mock swedes that much any more . 
  they 'll spit in our coffee . 
  we 're doing it out of the goodness of our collective heart , of course .
