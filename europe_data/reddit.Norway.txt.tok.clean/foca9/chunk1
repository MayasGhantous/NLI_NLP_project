i was originally under the impression that it is the east/central areas of turkey that voted for him , but iirc he got a lot of votes in istanbul as well . 
  are there any clear demographics in favour of him ? 
  like do religious people support him , and seculars do n't , or something else ? 
  ( although you can perfectly well be secular * and * religious , but you probably get what i 'm trying to say ) . 
  or is it other reasons people vote for him ? 
  if you 're norwegian , how did you know about the irish tradition before the scandinavian one ? 
  [ vamp : `` tir n ' a noir '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzcorqlfszw ) ( norwegian ), 
  anyway , [ * lilyhammer * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1958961/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) is probably the most famous one . 
  of more news type programmes , i really like * urix * ( news from the whole world , 20 minutes four days a week ) and * dagsnytt atten * ( basically a radio debate show showed on television ) . 
  oh , yeah , that exists , of course . 
  we call it * hjemmebrent * ( alt . 
  * heimbrent * , lit . 
  `` home burnt '' ) . 
  and make [ * karsk * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karsk ) . 
  thank god alcohol is not included ; it would have been even worse . 
  when we drove through germany this summer , they played `` au revoir '' all the time on the radio , and i still kind of like it . 
  [ opinions like this are not uncommon ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2hcs2v/muslims_vs_isis_day_of_protest_in_germany_against/ckrika1 ) . 
  people complain all the time that moderate muslims do n't stand up against muslim extremists/islamists , and when they do , it 's `` a waste of news space '' ? 
  he was danish in the book , although nikolaj would be great even if the character was norwegian !, 
  these few guys get as much attention from media ( probably * more * outside of norway ) than the much , much larger anti-is demonstration we had in oslo a couple of weeks ago ... 
  i feel i agree with the general consensus in this subreddit on almost everything , and i 'm genuinely surprised that people think this should be illegal . 
  [ * fl\u00e5klypa grand prix * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073000/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) ( 1975 ) * trolljegeren * ( [ * troll hunter * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740707/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) ) ( 2010 ) * hodejegerne * ( [ * headhunters * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=nv_sr_fn&amp;q=headhunter&amp;s=all ) ) ( 2011 ), 
  not surprising , 'cause you make good television . 
  i 'm looking forward to this . 
  hopefully it 'll be on norwegian television shortly after the original airing . 
  you should try / r/askeurope . 
  [ nrk ] ( http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/1.11198338 ) is streaming something from bbc right now . 
  no idea about restrictions , or if we can watch the same thing on their own site . 
  this is fun , either way . 
  good luck , scots and other brits . 
  i have to say i think it would be interesting with a yes vote , and what that will mean for scotland , the ( r ) uk , and the rest of europe and the eu . 
  just slightly related : i remember some british nature show from norway a couple of years ago , where the narrater said : `` this is like scotland on drugs . '', 
  * ell\u00e1da * , `` greece '' in greek . 
  hey , we had wildfire during last * winter * . 
  damn !, 
  i know eastern turkey have a lot of mountains ( and snow ) , but i 'd never , never guess this is so close to the parts of turkey where `` intolerable heat '' comes to mind . 
  ** norwegian : ** probably some the other scandinavians know , especially the danes . 
  * n\u00e5r man snakker om sola , s\u00e5 skinner den * ( `` speak of the sun and it shines '' ) and its funnier sibling/slang version * n\u00e5r man snakker om driten , s\u00e5 renner ` n * ( same , only with `` shit '' which ... well , you know ) . 
  both mean `` speak of the devil '' . 
  * rosinen i p\u00f8lsa * ( lit . 
  `` the raisin in the sausage '' ) which means `` the best ( of something ) '' or `` the highlight '' . 
  `` to shit on the leg '' ) , to fuck up . 
  i 'd consider this one as slang . 
  `` to jump after wirkola '' ) , to follow and do better than a world champion . 
  wirkola was a great norwegian ski jumper . 
  `` to sit with the beard in the mail box '' ) . 
  to be tricked or conned , and then you 're left with your beard in the mail box . 
  `` to scream for the elk/moose '' ) . 
  to puke , which often sound like the sound the animal makes . 
  used when drinking too much . 
  and every norwegian 's favourite word : * dugnad * . 
  no idea how to translate it , so here 's [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dugnad#dugnad ) . 
  wow , where did you get that number from ? 
  if we take the beer most people are drinking ( carlsberg , etc. 
  ) , it 's ~ 30 kr for a .5 l can . 
  a sixpack is then 180 kr , which is about $ 22 . 
  my hometown 's closest airport . 
  by just my generalisation and stereotyping , i 'd say people around there are pretty crazy about it . 
  the duty free shops are ridiculous , in my opinion . 
  this is not just oslo . 
  we also have the most expensive everything . 
  it was pretty well-known even before that , was n't it ? 
  is n't deflation bad , period ? 
  they are trying to get us to join the eu . 
  some of that make the finns sound like the best people . 
  `` independence '' sounds nice , but i do n't think that 's most important now . 
  maybe it was in 1994 . 
  although the word is thrown around like other buzzwords by the no campaign , i do think people are more concerned with the financial situation currently . 
  and if we 'll fuck up , and need the eu in the future , i think that will be more important than the vague concept of `` independence '' . 
  it 's not like we are completely independent now , with schengen , eea , etc. 
  was in istanbul last year right before the protests . 
  fucking awesome city , one of my favourite cities now . 
  i 'll certainly come back !, 
  everything was just great , so much cool stuff to see , and the food was n't too bad either . 
  did n't meet many turks there . 
  they spook such good english , i did n't learn any turkish words either . 
  i know one norwegian-turkish girl , and she 's awesome , and pretty beautiful . 
  started to read orhan pamuk when i was in istanbul , and i 'm reading * snow * now . 
  really like him , he looks to be one of my favourite authors . 
  not part of the european union , so do n't know if i 'll answer this . 
  as it only takes one member country to veto it , i think the chances are slim . 
  turkey should at least be an important ally/friend . 
  as of the protests and some other shit that has come out , i 'm not that big a fan of erdo\u011fan . 
  anyway he is not my politician to vote on , but i do n't think he 's helping how turkey is viewed in the rest of europe . 
  do n't know much about atat\u00fcrk , but hear good things about him !, 
  he and his turkey probably has and can be an important ideal for secular muslims in other countries . 
  i 'm not that old to really remember the reasons for 1994 referendum , but now i 'd say the financial crisis , which have hit eu countries more than norway . 
  whether you blame the eu itself or not , it does n't look intriguing for us to join when the eu countries have their problems . 
  [ look at how the polls have decreased since 2008 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norway_and_the_european_union#opinion_polling ) . 
  ** short answer : ** `` we are doing well on our own right now '' . 
  * my personal view on it , if you 're interested : * with the eea we 're basically an eu member , we only keep our fisheries and agriculture out of the deal . 
  we 're one of the best at implementing eu legislation . 
  we 're part of schengen , europol , the battlegroups , follow your russia sanctions , pay for access to the single market , etc. 
  but we have no representation . 
  some say the eu is undemocratic . 
  at least representation in the ep is more democratic than this . 
  we 're not realistically going to get a bilateral agreement . 
  i think we should join the eu . 
  actually the big parties , arbeiderpartiet ( labour party ) and h\u00f8yre ( conservatives ) , are the strongest advocates for the eu . 
  either of them is usually in government ( h\u00f8yre currently ) , but the public is so strongly against right now that they would n't pursue it .
