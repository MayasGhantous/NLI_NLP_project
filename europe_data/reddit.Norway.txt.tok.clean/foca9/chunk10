  yes , it is . 
  no , because * kids * do n't `` totally deserve '' to get kicked in the head . 
  race and/or religion is totally irrelevant in this one . 
  in a way , you 're right , but it 's not like `` who won '' will be a discussion . 
  it 's just how it works . 
  there 's two quotes from last night i really like . 
  helle thorning-schmidt yesterday when she resigned : `` we won the election campaign , but we lost the election . '', 
  when lars l\u00f8kke rasmussen left his house , a journalist asked him : `` l\u00f8kke , did you win or did you lose ? '', 
  though there are some interesting differences . 
  df is bigger than v-dk . 
  one of the reasons our current government was possible , was because h\u00f8yre ( with pm ) was bigger than frp , which meant that krf and v-no could support it ( contrast with 2009 , when they would n't agree to a pm from frp -- the bigger party ) . 
  the parties also generally agree on economical issues ( frp is closer to v-dk and la on economy they are to than df ) . 
  as i 've gotten to understand it , la might not support a government that follows df 's economical politics ? 
  but this is really exciting stuff . 
  better than borgen !, 
  it 's not that big of a difference if you look at it from the outside , i guess . 
  they 've had some problems agreeing to all of those things that a populist/wing party will have to accept when the parliamentary majority is based in centre and centre-right -- which wing parties seem to be bad at , like when a party openly disagree with the government ( we call it * sv-fella * , `` sv trap '' , after the ( left ) wing party sv in the former government , which have lost and still keep losing in the polls ) . 
  as they 've been losing in the polls ( election : 16 % , now ~ 10 % ) , the party has been trying to ride two horses : one as a government party ( leader siv jensen and ministers ) , and one more like a opposition party ( second in command per sandberg and * grasrota * -- grassroots ) . 
  an example is that while the government probably will have to follow through on a refugee quota from syria agreed by the other parties in parliament , while per sandberg has proposed a referendum on the issue . 
  it 's also been pretty heated between him and the krf leader ( one of the parties supporting , making the parliament majority ) . 
  i does n't really look pretty , but i have to say it makes for interesting politics . 
  and i admire them for taking the responsibility and joining government , especially as we all saw what happened to sv . 
  it 's the first time our progress party is as well , the election is just longer ago ( 2013 ) . 
  how will that fly with their voters ? 
  yeah , it 's the same here . 
  i was thinking more of forming a government , say , if a bloc alternative did n't work out or something . 
  have a few questions for you , danes ( or ever feel the need to answer ) . 
  how cemented are the blocs ? 
  could n't , say , radikale as easily cooperate with parties like venstre and la as enhedslisten and sf ? 
  radikale seems to lose half their seats . 
  do they continue in government even with that loss ? 
  enhedslisten seems to be the second largest party in the bloc -- likely that they would want in ? 
  df , el are strongest against eu . 
  what about sf , c and la ? 
  i 've seen people on / r/denmark complain about radikale on * offentlighedsloven * . 
  * god valgdag !, 
  `` dpp party '', 
  yup , it does . 
  apparently * kost * comes from the same word as * kvast * , which we seem to have gotten from german through swedish . 
  no worries , i just wanted to point out the difference . 
  in contrast , both / r/sweden and / r/denmark are their main subreddits and ( mainly ) in swedish and danish , respectively . 
  / r/norway is in english , while / r/norge is in norwegian and our main subreddit . 
  i 'll do to english : * ku-kost * = `` cow broom '' * kuk-ost * = `` cock cheese '' ( i.e. 
  well , you used the english language subreddit for norway . 
  how representative is that one for norway ? 
  not much , i 'd say , last time i checked it was a mix of a travel agency and an immigration office . 
  in / r/norge the top post is ... uhm ... [ this . 
  * nederland * , though a lot of people say * holland * ( mostly older people , is my impression ) . 
  what 's up with so many former radikale ( social liberal ) politicians leaving and starting new parties ? 
  would radikale have done better if margrete vestager still was their leader ? 
  correct , most of this !, 
  though iirc , * our * bid were n't vetoed in 1962 , but we withdrew ours because uk 's bid was vetoed . 
  after wwii we looked closely on what the uk did , especially in foreign politics . 
  in the later years the u.s. ( militarily ) and the eu ( economically ) have taken over more i guess . 
  we call it * loff * . 
  weird to call luxembourg `` the richest duchy in the world '' , as it 's the only duchy in the world . 
  as some norwegian guy tweeted : `` to bad russia did n't get to host europride 2016 . '', 
  i thought yours was by far the best . 
  one of the few eurovision songs i 'll keep listening to . 
  actually it 's the swedes that keep settling in norwegian towns . 
  yeah , i do n't know much about english legal wording , but the tag `` illegal '' seems a bit dramatic . 
  `` banned '' might be better . 
  what the opinion of the population ? 
  the map on the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_europe ) -- which is basically the same -- says it means `` constitution limits marriage to opposite-sex couples '' . 
  i really like this . 
  makes sense though !, 
  more of this type of pictures/posts !, 
  yeah , / r/norway too . 
  do n't usually frequent that anymore , but here 's a [ random visit a few weeks ago . 
  ** favourite ** : latvia ** probably gon na win ** : sweden ** kind-of-like-it ** : iceland , switzerland ** not-boring-and/or-ballad points ** : israel , slovenia ** native language points ** : portugal , montenegro, 
  agree . 
  and it becomes so boring when all sing in english . 
  if i voted , i 'd vote for you guys ( so far ) . 
  though , when we 've sent norwegian songs , we 've ended with 0 points ... 
  `` maybe you 're just listening , and looking at another screen ? '', 
  uh ... nope ... 
  okay , i know the songs are usually shit and so on . 
  but at least it usually is * entertaining * . 
  so far it 's just been plain boring . 
  when someone sings/says something not in english nor in their native tongue . 
  i just turned off todd terje . 
  yeah , this better be good . 
  was n't planning on it , but i think i 'll join you too . 
  i heard it was the favourite , and expected something relatively good -- `` euphoria '' sprang to my mind , naturally . 
  nope , this was pretty boring and predictable imo . 
  i really like de molen citra . 
  also hoegaarden ( wit ) , the is the only witbier i 've liked so far . 
  [ `` i dovregubbens hall '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xriyt-mrvai ) is pretty cool , while [ `` morgenstemning '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcezh3mwily ) might be his most famous work . 
  yup !, 
  though there 's potensial for other types , such as wind and tidal power here , and there 's been some talk about us being a `` green battery '' , especially if eu continues to work towards an energy union . 
  poor finland and iceland . 
  at least * some * part of norway is on here ... 
  although not even oslo is covered . 
  task completed !, 
  interesting . 
  the norwegian and swedish ones seem to have changed the name from `` lambsbottom '' to * rumpbottom * ( sw . ) and * rumpelbottom * ( no . 
  ) , where * rumpa * ( s ) and * rumpe * ( n ) means `` bottom '' or `` butt '' ( possibly related to the english word `` rump '' ) . 
  on the other hand , the danish one have changed it too * langballe * , a common surname that can be translated into something like `` long balls '' , and is pretty hilarious . 
  admittedly i do really like the danish change , because it is a name that can be funny the same way any - bottom name is ( if you think bottom is a funny word ) . 
  in fact , neville longbottom was changed to * nilus langballe * in the norwegian * harry potter * books/films .
