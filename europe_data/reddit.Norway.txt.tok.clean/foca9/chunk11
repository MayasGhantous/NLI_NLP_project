  another digression here is that in said norwegian * harry potter * books `` quidditch '' was translated into * rumpeldunk * ( * rumpe * again ) , which we 're had fun with when we were kids . 
  when got a bit older , we laughed at the `` golden snitch '' , 'cause its name , * gullsnoppen * , sounds like a nickname for a dick ... 
  does n't the president have more power than parliament-elected presidents such as the german , italian , and greek ones ? 
  edit : nope . 
  what , are you saying sweden is n't the pc muslim socialist gay utopian shithole non-swedish redditors is telling me it is ? 
  i found [ this ] ( http://wordofman.blogspot.no/2008/08/christianity-tenth-plague.html ) . 
  seems to some guy ( eivind ) translating it , and not an `` official '' one . 
  is n't that a pretty well-known place in england/the uk ? 
  you do n't follow football , perhaps ? 
  looks like this is even more unpredictable than people have thought , even considering that has been tirelessly repeated for the last months . 
  i love it . 
  those exit polls though honestly took me by surprise considering the earlier polls , but i think it 's even more exciting now . 
  libdems probably want to continue a coalition , but would they consent to losing influence in the coalition in relation to their loss ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  a bit less , but not nowhere near ~ 1/6 ( exit poll ) compared to what they 've got now . 
  interesting to see , especially how many mps they 'll get . 
  is that supposed to mark kristiansand ? 
  also , arendal is apparently also a ubc member city . 
  most centrist parties will work both ways . 
  it usually works that way in a multiple party system , and pretty much the definition of a centrist party . 
  pretty interesting election !, 
  so many open questions before ( and after ) the vote . 
  question for brits ( or others who feel they can contribute ) : how likely do you think any decision towards an election reform is in the next parliament ? 
  edit : reform , not form . 
  the association version is basically like what we 've got today ? 
  of what i 've read , * seierherrene * by roy jacobsen springs to mind . 
  it does a good job of depicting how norway has changed through the 20th century . 
  we follow a three generations ' journey from a rural , farming and fishing-based life to a modern , more urban existence in ( post ? ), 
  industrialised society . 
  ** but ** afaik it 's only translated into swedish and danish -- which does n't make any real difference ( if you can read either of them , you 'll probably manage the original ) . 
  i love pamuk and * snow * especially for these reasons !, 
  it 's really interesting to get to know turkey by his novels . 
  the east/west divide is interesting . 
  i went out and bought all his other books after i read * snow * and * black book * -- which kind of disappointed me after hearing great things . 
  i learned a lot about turkey , atat\u00fcrk , etc. , but it was n't as good as * snow * imo . 
  so i have some questions : are any of the books `` best '' at depicting turkey , or more committed to depict turkey and its citizens ? 
  or does all of them do a good job at that some way or another ? 
  how much do we non-turkish-speakers lose ? 
  i 've heard the language is quite poetic , and there might be some wordplays ? 
  like ka , * kar * ( `` snow '' ) , and kars seem to be one in * snow * ... which book should i read next ? 
   have you seen and/or have thoughts on [ * winter sleep * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2758880/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt ) ? 
  the summary reminded me so much about * snow * . 
  but you 've kept watching ? 
  ca n't say it has changed much it that sense ( still a slow-paced character drama ) , but it 's certainly just getting better and better as it goes . 
  wow , it sounds like a really cool festival ( ? ), 
  or whatever it can be called . 
  and it seems there 's * a lot * of great shows there !, 
   tl ; dr : the right balance between `` the americans '' and `` chuck '' . 
  the right balance between * the americans * and anything ** is ** * the americans * . 
  imo clearly the best show on television now ( although i 'll wait to see what * hannibal * and * rectify * do in the summer ) . 
  ** on these shows ** have heard mixed opinions on * jordskott * . 
  anyone seen it and have thoughts ? 
  i see * 1992 * is in their selection as well . 
  currently watching it , and i really like it . 
  about * [ mani pulite ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mani_pulite ) * in italy in 1992 . 
  as is * the affair * . 
  kind of liked it , but mostly because of the four main actors ( ruth wilson , dominic west , joshua jackson , maura tierney ) who do great work , the plot not so much . 
  * game of thrones * speaks for itself . 
  i do n't know about the others , but * okkupert * ( * occupied * ) has n't aired yet . 
  it says `` premiere '' on * deutschland 83 * and * false flag * as well . 
  i use safari \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  i 'd try / r/askeurope if i were you, 
  are n't they pro-eu ? 
  how is the public view on that nowadays , since the withdrawal of application ? 
  oh , that explains it !, 
  pardon my french , 
  and even though i zoomed in more than i did with the others ( mostly because switzerland and austria were empty if i did n't ), 
  it 's almost like if not every library in europe has the word `` library '' in its name, 
  luckily we ditched the 50 \u00f8re ( 0.50 kr ) coin recently . 
  i collect the smallest coins -- 1 kr , 5 kr ( and earlier 50 \u00f8re ) in a glas jar which i bring to the bank every other year . 
  10 and 20 kr i * can * keep in my pocket if i bother . 
  mostly use card anyway . 
  those small eurocent coins though , they 're a pain in the ass . 
  usually i just throw them in the next fountain i come over . 
   i am not even american ok .  if you do not get your facts from actual footage like these ones and many others then you are nothing but idiot . 
  sorry , but using youtube as a source is reason enough direct that insult ( `` idiot '' if you did n't catch that ) straight back at you . 
  here , take a [ youtube video better suited for you . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urglg3wimha ), 
  you know , your dear fox news has [ apologised for the no-go zone remarks ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/01/18/fox-news-corrects-apologizes-for-no-go-zone-remarks/ ) . 
  also , great sources you come up with . 
  an american conservative -- with low credibility -- news network and an conservative american think tank . 
  the fact that you say `` europe has been defeated by islamism '' as europe 's any single political entity shows how little you know about anything . 
  this as an awful example of `` let me tell you about your country '' . 
  good bye and fuck off . 
  your first mistake is using fox news as a source for ~ ~ anything ~ ~ a debate . 
  urban vs. rural is always a debate . 
  * we have the same centre party as you ( * senterpartiet * ) . 
  they 're originally agrarian ( literally called farmer 's party ) , and they mostly cater voters in rural areas . 
  * agriculture is not exactly perfectly suited for norway . 
  subsidies and toll barriers are a huge demand from rural farmers , while urban people would probably like cheaper food . 
  * we 're going to have a municipal reform ( * kommunereform * ) . 
  so far mostly talks , but it 's going to happen . 
  how much power should be held locally , and how much in oslo ? 
  * urban vs. rural is part of the ( currently non-existing ) eu debate , with agriculture being one of the reasons . 
  more power further away is another . 
  people in the cities are more pro eu ( if any can be said to be nowadays ) . 
  * general oslo vs. * periferi * / * bygda * / the rest rivalry/dislike / `` hate '' . 
  * example of the last one was apparent during the 2018 and 2022 olympic bids ( i 'll try to explain ) . 
  troms\u00f8 was chosen in 2018 as candidate , but it was shut down by the sport organisation itself . 
  when oslo was decided for 2022 , this was quite unpopular among many people outside oslo , among northerners especially .
