  now it was suddenly okay among the decision-making leaders , 'cause it was in oslo ? 
  factor in negativity in the public in general ( especially non-oslo ) , the insanely huge amounts of money it costs , and the levels of corruption , this bid did n't get support from the government . 
  one local newspaper in oslo wrote `` it happened because people hate oslo '' afterwards . 
  * should we have wolves or not ? 
  a big city -- rural debate , and the centre party argues most against the animal . 
  is the locals safety or national environmental goals and preservation most important ? 
  currently there 's a trial of several illegal wolf huntings in rural areas . 
  speak : * ** norwegian ** ( and by extent , swedish and danish ) * ** english ** half-way , not fluently : * ** spanish ** . 
  learnt a lot of grammar and conjugation , but still really need to expand my vocabulary , and learn idioms and such . 
  trying to read bola\u00f1os ' * los detectives salvajes * now for that exact reason . 
  just started learning : * ** german ** . 
  probably easier to learn for me . 
  barely started . 
  planning on learning : * ** french ** want to learn : * ** arabic ** , ** russian **, 
  so , do you have trouble when you 're speaking with norwegians or swedes ? 
  we apparently are getting worse at understanding each other ( i believe i understand both the others pretty well ) . 
  if you 'd like to improve , my advice is seeking out some interesting podcasts . 
  kind of passive learning , but still get the needed `` daily '' interaction . 
  my favourite probably is * europa lige nu * , as it also covers europe better than any norwegian media . 
  holy shit , that comment section gave me cancer . 
  it 's youtube level idiocy . 
  honestly i do n't think that much has changed . 
  you could say the 2011 terrorist attacks , but imo not much has changed because of that -- for better ( `` this shall not change us '' ) or worse ( you could argue there were/are problems with police and public safety , for instance ) . 
  maybe the 2013 election is one , it 's the only governmental change since 2005 . 
  a government with the progress party for the first time . 
  actually i 'd add the fall in the oil price , which can mark the beginning of a bigger change for us in the future , 'cause i think it 's safe to say it 's only going one way for the oil industry now -- although it will take time . 
  history ( especially around wwii ) also include a lot of bad stuff done by norwegians , which seems to only been talked about in greater detail the last few years ( might have to do with people of the period are nearing their end ) . 
  my impression up until now is that our national view has been `` la la we were on the right side '' and `` the bad things were done by germans '' . 
  ( i 'm mainly thinking about holocaust , and norwegians ' participation in the deportation of jews . 
  but also the treatment of , as you say , minorities ), 
  you 're right . 
  i looked at a small mobile screen first . 
  yeah , it seems more like goode or a hybrid of two projections . 
  i think they 've taken a projection like the robinson or winkel-tripel with the americas in the centre -- to get less distortion on the u.s. -- while they 've made it eurocentric . 
  i understand that they 've taken the americas as the centre , it 's natural ( as we naturally use a eurocentric one ) . 
  but why not keep the americas in the centre ? 
  it looks so much better ( although to split the map over asia/india is n't ideal ) . 
  though i 'm happy as long as they do n't use mercator . 
  looks like they 've `` distorted '' northern eurasia so that north america can look `` straight '' . 
  the norwegian word for hen ( as in female chicken ) -- * h\u00f8ne * -- is slang for female genitalia . 
  this meaning is also noted in the dictionary . 
  true , and this year 's [ abel prize ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abel_prize ) -- named after him -- was announced today !, 
  * you forgot / u/dclauzel !, 
  well , i guess ylvis and nico & vinz nowadays . 
  last summer `` am i wrong '' was played in every european country we drove through . 
  apparently also ole gunnar solskj\u00e6r is a name you can say in the middle of a rainforest and people will know him . 
  by the ( ridiculous ) number of articles in norwegians papers you would think martin \u00d8degaard , but probably just a hype we created ourselves . 
  jo nesb\u00f8 has been all over as well . 
  i found one of his books in a book shop in betlehem , and a guard on the israeli -- jordanian border could not shut up about his books when she saw my passport . 
  i think i got that , i 'm just giving what i believe is the reason . 
  i do n't really care much about marriage myself ( at this point , at least ) , but other people might think it 's a big deal . 
  if you do n't get what the deal is , just allow them to get married ? 
  it 's probably not a big deal to * get married * , the important part was that * they were n't allowed * ( or are n't allowed , depending on country ) . 
  then they are not treated equal as opposite-sex coupes , and i understand completely that gay and lesbians ( and other , me included ) would want that discrimination abolished . 
  northern ireland has n't , though ? 
  only england , wales , and scotland . 
  edit : no need to downvote , just read [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/same-sex_marriage_in_the_united_kingdom ) . 
  maybe it 's illustrating that i just wrote four paragraphs which i then deleted and tried again ... it 's complicated . 
  here are my two cents : i think we can generalise into to points : \u00b7 we do n't talk with strangers in public , on the street , bus , etc. 
  it 's a social norm . 
  doing it feels foreign . 
  but just a `` reason '' -- someone need directions , or someone else breaks the ice , we 'll hold a perfectly fine conversation . 
  maybe we only say something when we feel it 's necessary , and contributing to the conversation . 
  \u00b7 we stick to people we know . 
  a stranger with a group of friends will most likely feel left out . 
  it 's not done with intent , we 're not mean , it 's just that we usually rather talk to , and be with , friends . 
  it 's not that we 're directly excluding people , but the * barrier of inclusion * -- the way into a status a member of a group , as a friend -- can be really long and difficult . 
  as you might know yourself , these kinds of norms and internalised conventions are n't as important when you drink . 
  we 'll probably talk to * anybody * , 
  were they drunk ? 
  seriously though , we usually are , but you need to get past that first barrier , which can be difficult . 
  a party ( or * vors * ) , a sports club , or something social to do often works . 
  any speculation/rumours/etc . 
  on which parties might make up a coalition ? 
  or would the largest party try as a minority government automatically ? 
  ( i see the article says no-one will announce any plans , but feel free to speculate ), 
  really liked him on * borgen * and * sherlock * too . 
  you 're doing great in the international ( anglo-american ) tv landscape with him , mads , and nikolaj !, 
  i kind of enjoyed it , but i agree it was n't very good . 
  cool for the european aspect of it , i guess . 
  do you get automatic benefits for being married ? 
  if yes : what about straight couples without children ? 
  that 's in principle the same as gay couple without children . 
  otherwise , gay couples can raise adopted `` taxpayers '' ( i find it weird to characterise children as `` future taxpayers '' , though ) . 
  easy solution to the problem : let the benefits follow the * child * , not the * marriage * . 
  honestly this really just sounds like a bad argument for keeping gays from getting married . 
  yes . 
  do you ? 
  `` marriage '' is not an absolute thing . 
  traditionally it meant a union between a man and a woman . 
  now ( at least here , and in the more progressive countries ) it means a union between * two people * . 
  `` marriage '' is not set in stone . 
  traditionally it was decided by the parents of the two . 
  now it 's often done by two people who love each other , or two consenting people who want the advantages , the ritual , and responsibility that follows a marriage . 
  i respect that not everybody shares or want that . 
  but i find refusing other people to do the same thing to be petty . 
  thanks !, 
  should have guessed , with cdu 's name ... 
  i 'm interested in germany , switzerland , and austria : is there a debate ? 
  is it politicians or the public that 's `` holding back '' ?
