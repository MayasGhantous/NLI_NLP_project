  powerful religious people and/or a powerful church ? 
  or is it decision for local jurisdiction/states to make ? 
  whole europe should be dark blue . 
  nothing less . 
  yeah , the green politics has mainly been kept by venstre ( liberal ) and sv ( socialist left party ) on each wing . 
  they 've sometimes even said themselves that `` if you are on the left wing and want green politics , vote sv . 
  if you are on the right wing , vote venstre '' , so they 've split the green voters between each other . 
  also krf ( christian democrats ) have catered the green voters . 
  we honestly take great pride in our environmental politics , just not by doing something with the oil * in norway * -- e.g. 
  we support third world countries , pay for saving the rain forests , try and take a leading role during the world conferences ( been asked to , too ) . 
  sounds hypocritical , i know , probably is too , but that 's how it is . 
  the greens are now stealing voters from sv ( they 've suffered after their time in government ) , but also the other parties with no green traditions . 
  mainly from people that was disappointed with the red-green coalition 's green politics , but did n't think the former opposition would be any better . 
  the green have stated that they will support those with the best environmental policies -- i.e. 
  free of the `` bloc politics '' . 
  they 're still growing , it seems . 
  * activism * ? 
  ** activism ??? 
  ** you must be * really * mistaken on who that is , because that 's the only sensible way you characterise his actions as `` activism '' . 
  the music in nrk 's ones are made by r\u00f6yksopp, 
  so they 're gon na ban all the videoes of [ himno del pp versi\u00f3n latina ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmgfcoszcge ) ? 
  yes !, 
  we changed from `` two-and-twenty '' to `` twenty-two '' as the norm in the 50s . 
  it takes time . 
  personally i can do both , if needed , but certainly prefer the newest . 
  it 's generally a generational thing -- most young people only use `` twenty-two '' . 
  you should try it up here in december \u263a, 
  looks like a james bond villain hq, 
  the fact that russia has invaded georgia and ukraine does n't mean that armenia 's best strategy is to avoid russia ... they neighbour turkey and azerbaijan , you know , their best friends . 
  sure , but that means `` scandinavian humour '' works with even more people than just italians !, 
  roy andersson 's latest film won the golden lion ( venice ), 
  lol , the uk would 've blocked anything close to a common border defence , so that 's not weird at all . 
  well that 's unrealistic for the time being . 
  lol . 
  no need to tell me that . 
  what do you care , being swiss and all ? 
   ( if you 're serious : we 're in efta and eea , a lot of eu policy and decisions affect us , if not directly then we 're willing participants ( schengen , migration policy , climate policy ) . 
  i certainly care about eu working well , even though that phrase was said jokingly ) . 
  honestly it was more tongue-in-cheek . 
  if you want my literal opinion , i would think `` make the eurozone work better '' is more like it . 
  i 'm not so certain . 
  if we 're gon na save the euro , and fix migration and stop terrorism we need to work together in europe ... you could even say all of these are due to * lack of * european cooperation ( lack of fiscal union , lack of outer border control and/or real cooperation on migration , lack of better security cooperation ... ), 
  is n't this a huge problem for the eu ? 
  there 's no one really out there to take credit for what they do -- especially not here !, 
  currently all the telecom companies in norway brag how * they * are removing roaming charges in the eu -- still have n't heard anyone mention how this is because of eu regulation . 
  politics have a lot of spin doctors already , but eu need to spin these things in their favour , it will show people that they actually do something fruitful in brussels ... 
  do anyone else but the anglosphere ? 
  weirdly it 's same argument as in eurovision !, 
  so if we 're going to learn something from letting everyone sending english songs to esc , i guess it means we 'll get a bunch of similar-looking , boring politicians who speak english . 
  i guess i could live with that !, 
  i found out there 's accents/dialects of english where the h is not pronounced in some of these words . 
  ( apparently ) the most common example is `` herb '' , which brits call * herb * and americans call * ` erb * . 
  therefore the first sound is a vowel , so if you say * ` istory * or * ` erb * , `` an '' is a natural consequence and correct grammar . 
  it 's all about what sound comes after . 
  probably this `` an h -- '' sounds better when said out loud , though , and similarly might look weird in writing , depending on what you say yourself . 
  this sounds like advice that just works for native or fluent speakers . 
  if you 're still learning it , it makes no `` intuitive '' sense . 
  also if you do n't pronounce the h in `` hotel '' , an hotel is correct ( `` an ` otel '' ) . 
  * a when the following * sound * is a consonant * an when the following * sound * is a vowel . 
  the tricky part is that , in english , the letter y can both be a vowel or a consonant , or when the word has an invisible `` y '' - type sound at beginning ( in ipa , and in my language we would write `` j '' for that sound ) -- like ( y ) uniform , ( y ) uropean ( there 's a reason / r/yurop is written that way ! ) . 
  examples : * an apple * a red apple * an english apple * a european ( `` yuropean '' ) * an old european * a tired old european abbreviations can be tricky as well , and depends on `` word '' or `` letter-for-letter '' pronounciation : * an eu referendum ( `` ee-yu '' ) * a nato summit * an nhs doctor ( `` en-aitch-ess '' ), 
  lol , the result in itself easily proves that the opposite is just as true ( brits hate europeans ) . 
  we 're part of the single market through eea, 
  you say that like no president/speaker of a parliament is not voted in by members of said parliament . 
   it 's just his opinion yes . 
  a politician , even an elected one , voicing his opinion ? 
  crazy, 
  he 's elected to the ep by german citizens . 
  did n't think about you being caught in the middle more than `` liberated '' from one side or another !, 
  for us it 's still `` victory '' and `` liberation '' as we like to think we were on the `` right '' side of the war . 
  though it has been nuanced in the last few years , which i think is good . 
   sure there is the yearly drama of may 9th what is it ? 
  that europe day is celebrated the same day as liberation day ? 
  so is this some spanish meme i 've missed out on ? 
  i like it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdg3tcobaea, 
  `` take back control '' trust me , i 'm norwegian , i know how this works . 
  we rather want the illusion of `` independence '' than actual influence in brussels . 
  the title sounds so weird in english, 
  [ `` experience '' ] ( https://youtu.be/hn_q-_ngv4u ) is my favourite of his . 
  it 's so greatly used in xavier dolan 's * mommy * . 
  man , i 'm happy this has n't happened here . 
  our 17th may celebrations could look crazy for people of countries like yours ( i guess germany too ) . 
   over the last month it has become very clear to me and my environment that the pvv had no chance at all to become the biggest party it 's pretty obvious if you know how a proportionally parliamentary system works , with the fact that all/most other parties does n't want to work with them -- pvv would obviously need a lot more than they were polling to get in power/the pm . 
  media covering the election should be able to understand and find this out ( if they 're not complete idiots , and especially coming from a similar system ) , and should be able to write this in these news articles !, 
  it was crazy reading `` wilders might be pm '' and `` will the dutch get their trump ? '', 
  no matter what the polls showed . 
  i do n't think it 's just anglo media . 
  norwegian media has had wilders as the centre point in every article about the election . 
  even the main news an hour ago was `` wilders does n't look to win '' . 
  at this point i 'm very certain more people know who wilders is than the man who 've been the dutch pm for over six years . 
   70 \u2105 / r/unexpectedcareof, 
  lucky !, 
  i remember we only lost our pe class because the indoor sports arena was used for polling station . 
  ketchup is tolerable om burgers and hotdogs . 
  that 's it . 
  how anyone eat it on anything else is beyond me . 
  afaik the norwegian one is a remake of the danish one, 
  i guess it 's just a mashup of german stereotypes . 
  in sweden and norway it 's common to say german tourists steal the moose signs, 
  [ we have your back on this one !,
