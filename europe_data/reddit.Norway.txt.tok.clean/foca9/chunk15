  in reality people might consider `` standard \u00f8stnorsk '' ( basically oslo ) to be a standard * spoken * language , but people speak whatever they want everywhere . 
  people are proud of their dialects , and will use them as much as possible . 
  to mix-up , or water down your dialect , -- * \u00e5 knote * -- is not a positive term . 
  dammit !, 
  read through it several times , but that one slipped . 
  iirc it was part of the creation of our language . 
  when we did names of cities , countries , etc. 
  the goal was to ** do what the people do themselves ** , and not copy danish/german ( you could see how this was important to landsm\u00e5l / nynorsk ) . 
  greece is * hellas * ( < - * ell\u00e1s * ) , not * grekenland * ( < - ger. , * griechenland * ) latvia is * latvia * ( < - * latvija * ) , not * lettland * ( de/da/sv ) it 's generally more noticeable when talking about city names , where german/danish/swedish uses an `` old '' common name of a city , while we use the `` native '' . 
  this is easy to see when using old proverbs that uses this old name . 
  `` all roads lead to rome '' , * alle veier f\u00f8rer til rom * , even though we call it ** roma ** today . 
  shakespeare 's * merchant of venice * is translated to * kj\u00f8pmannen i venedig * even though we call it ** venezia ** today . 
  english | de/da/sv | norwegian | * native * : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- rome | rom | roma | roma venice | venedig | venezia | venezia naples | neapel * | napoli | napoli prague | prag | praha | praha lisbon | lissabon | lisboa | lisboa belgrade | belgrad * | beograd | beograd ^ ( * danish uses napoli and beograd too ), 
  yes , and our relations were frozen up until recently , when said agreement was made . 
  actually there 's an agreement a while back where we agreed not to criticise china 's `` internal politics '' which got the `` market back open '' . 
  when liu xiaobo got sick our government went awfully quiet , and there 's been a lot of discussion about it -- especially as the eu had a blatantly different stance . 
  it 's from 2005 . 
  source : see it before christmas every year, 
  19 cents ? 
  it 's ~ 2 $ for the 0,5 bottle i buy, 
  buy bottle of sparkling water . 
  drink it . 
  fill with still water from faucet . 
  ( anyway that 's what i do . 
  could 've drank more sparkling , but shit 's expensive yo ), 
  ca n't you get the arctic ocean coast back ? 
  then we 'll lose the russia border . 
  also we 'd get rid of those annoying `` til there 's only one country between north korea and norway '' posts . 
  have we done `` trains of europe '' yet ? 
  is that ararat ? 
  our pm was invited , as was rajoy iirc, 
  it 's close to the harbour . 
  kind of a welcoming landmark whenever we went there by boat , 
  the people who were at [ eidsvoll in 1814 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_constituent_assembly ) , maybe ? 
   like the german model ? 
  did you mean council of europe ? 
  that 's the one georgia is part of . 
  relevant username, 
   create their own inflation policies is n't that what a lot of euro countries does n't want their country 's politicians to be able to do ? 
  not to be confused with [ this murnau ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/f._w._murnau_circa_1920-1930.jpg ) , as [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/nosferatushadow.jpg ) is not paradise . 
  you have no idea , our news papers have been bursting with wordplay in the last few days, 
  hey , i did n't say that 's want * i * wanted , i 'm just pointing out what 's gon na happen . 
  when the brits actually leave ? 
  it 's no surprise ; we 'll be up for anything as long we keep `` sovereignty '' and our agriculture and fishing out of it . 
  really happy we 're in on this !, 
  i liked it , i thought it said something true about politics and especially populists ( like universal criticism , not able to actually govern ) , but i did n't think anything like trump would actually happen ... 
  it 's crazy to look back and see how much of it came true ... 
  visited four years ago . 
  really great place , one of my favourite cities i 've visited . 
  though happy i went then and not now ( or near future ) . 
  i think most people expected some of the not-so-dumb people around him to make sure he did n't do this . 
  which elected official do you believe is as bad as your orange fucker ? 
   keiserlig og kongelig that 's what i call it , yes, 
  how many on the picture have careers ? 
  macron 's wife works with him , no ? 
  stoltenberg 's wife is the norwegian ambassador to belgium . 
  i thought it rather was because it is in brussels , so it makes sense that the king ( and the queen ) take part ? 
  our king is also commander-in-chief , but it 's the pm that 's at the summit . 
  i would think that 's the case for other countries ' kings/queens/president with the pms present . 
  thanks , now that 's in my thoughts as well !, 
  wtf did n't think of her !, 
  good thing it 's friday, 
  should be white shoes on black tiles and vice-versa as well, 
  majority men though . 
  i guess if mr. may or mr. merkel were there it would be more easily seen as `` spouses '' . 
  neither of them are very interested in being a public person for their country afaik ? 
  which other female leaders were at the nato meeting ? 
  croatian and lithuanian presidents , i think . 
  what do you think the eu is ? 
  the member states made this decision , together , as the european union . 
  tbf those `` multi-letters '' are n't hard to learn either . 
  how could i forget that franz-walter steinmeier was elected directly by the people , and that the german parliamentary election is n't the most important ? 
  i said german instead of the us for a reason . 
  good argument there bud . 
  really winning me over, 
  i 'm not gon na answer ; my comment was n't meant as a critic of the us ( i can see how it seemed that way ) . 
  i just think it 's not a system the eu should copy -- i do n't think it 's suitable . 
  i think a parliamentary elected `` pm '' ( juncker/merkel ) with a symbolic president elected indirectly ( steinmeier ) or by the countries through the council ( tusk ) fits better in a european context . 
  sure , it 's not perfect . 
  though in any case it 's the idea of the system that i 'd like , for the eu it will be a different discussion because there 's different powers in play than internally in germany . 
  i think a federal eu system will base its luck on whether or not the powers of eu vs. nations are well distributed . 
  is anyone saying we should copy the us ? 
  i 'd say that 's a really bad model . 
  if anything the eu should copy the german federal system . 
  that 's not exclusive to the u.k. , though . 
  you guys are unhealthily insular : you need to burst that bubble you live in , this is the reality for most western european economies . 
  do n't you think you 'd rather adopt the euro unilaterally right away ? 
  i 'm perfectly aware . 
  i 'm just saying that `` netherlands '' is not universally used in norway , even if it 's the correct name . 
  i thought more of the fact that it was a bit boring on stage . 
  i would 've thought she needed a better live show to get votes . 
  i thought there were some great songs this year !, 
  did n't think portugal was one of them , but it 's much better than many of the higher places songs like sweden or australia . 
  surprised belgium did so well , even though i loved the song -- it just seemed so out of place . 
  also loved bulgaria and italy ( hoped they won ) . 
  lot of people , especially old people , use `` holland '' though, 
  what about the french republic ? 
  anyways , afaik virtually every language has a `` czechia '' type name , so i do n't find it so weird that people want that form in english too . 
  how are those two even comparable ? 
  if you 'd say `` kingdom of norway '' it would be similar forms,
