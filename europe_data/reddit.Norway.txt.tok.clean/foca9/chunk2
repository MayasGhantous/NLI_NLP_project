  since it would need to go to a referendum , this is n't really a subject that people think of when they vote anyway . 
  i think the majority of the voters of arbeiderpartiet , and maybe also h\u00f8yre , disagrees with their party . 
  most of the smaller parties are either against or divided : centre party ( agricultural party , mainly ) and socialist left party are strongest against , and wants us out of the eea too . 
  the christian democrats are also against , but are comfortable with the eea . 
  the liberal party is * very * divided , although the youth party is for , so maybe they 'll be pro eu in the future , who knows . 
  both the progressive party ( right wing , part of government now ) and the greens have n't taken any position . 
  do you guys even try ? 
  / s on a more serious note , it 's amazing we 've held on to 1st place ( since 2001 , while 2007 and 2008 with iceland first , but with the same score as norway ) for so long , considering the placing behind have changed quite a bit each year . 
  although i guess us dodging the worst consequences of the financial crisis has helped . 
  fucking love [ ours ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ja,_vi_elsker ) ( * de facto * anthem , read more about that in the article ) . 
  a lot of god , lord , and religion in the second verse we usually sing ( we use 1 , 7 , 8 normally ) , which i 'm not that big a fan of , but i 'm okay with it . 
  i just realised how cheesy the title sounds in english . 
  that 's council of europe 's flag . 
  the eu just use it as well . 
  not that i 'm aware of , but i was barely born when the last referendum was held ( 1994 ) , so i have not much memory to back to . 
  it bare barely a no majority ( 52 -- 48 ) , and it was pretty narrow around that time , i guess . 
  since the financial crisis , it has just gone straight towards a practically total no to the eu . 
  even the pro-eu organisation kind of gave up a while back , waiting for the tides to turn . 
  agree on the feeling of how people seem to be on the left here . 
  although the majority norwegian redditors seem to be voting for our social liberal party , i think the social democrats are second . 
  fair enough . 
  i just dislike when our politicians call the us `` our greatest ally '' . 
  i think our greatest ally should be the eu ( `` europe '' ) , and in many ways it is . 
  but the eu is not a positive association for the moment . 
  i really , really dislike the weather we 've been having for the last couple of weeks . 
  it 's too hot , i 'm not made for this . 
  thankfully , it 's winter soon enough . 
  might not be the most unpopular opinion on a site such as this , though . 
  i want norway to join the eu . 
  ( * certainly * unpopular in norway . 
  no idea if it is between norwegian redditors , or other people in this subreddit ) . 
   i like merkel and voted for her . 
  is this an unpopular opinion ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  maybe we could just make that `` people '' ? 
  what about a mandatory tag of '' [ * language * ] '' if the article is not in english ? 
  i strongly think we have to have non-english articles , as we need other sources than just british and american news sites , but i agree that there should be a summary and/or a translation if it 's not in english . 
  your comment reminded me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh7zrf6znoc ) . 
  ** never **, 
  let 's associate all people with their religion or cultural group 's stereotypes and/or extremists . 
  nothing has ever gone wrong with that . 
  interesting to see what they 'll do with norway cup . 
  other than that , most of norway 's still in summer mode , i guess . 
  also a bit funny that we 're warned that `` we 'll see a lot of armed police '' . 
  it 's originally a norwegian production and every season is viewed on nrk before netflix . 
  though netflix were asked to join during production of season 1 ( iirc ) , said yes , and been part of production since season 2 onwards . 
  they are responsible for the growing budget they 've gotten , and surely the success outside norway . 
  since everybody 's totally against him , i kind of felt sorry for the guy . 
  then he opened his mouth . 
  demand , maybe ? 
  how does that have anything to do with my point ? 
  we were n't talking about soccer , were we ? 
  i was talking about the different interpretation of the word `` football '' . 
  now i love living in the city , but if my future wife wo n't move with me to my hometown , it 's going to be a problem . 
   remove the two-headed bird from our flag . 
  why ? 
  i think you have one of most beautiful flags . 
  although it may be just as nice without it . 
  just the bird , but keep the `` shield '' , or remove the whole coat of arms -- a `` plain '' flag ? 
  i think eu politicians -- and national pro-eu politicians -- need to talk about * what * they want when they say they are for a federal europe . 
  people need concrete examples of what it means , like the cut of roaming charges -- as an example of a positive change the eu is enforcing . 
  because no matter how well your intentions are when you say `` federalism '' , people are going to think of their own definition of the word -- either if that means a totalitarian stasi-superstate or the most free , perfect , and wonderful place on earth . ^ ^ norway, 
   words mean what the general public decide they mean and in the uk at least the term `` federalism '' refers to the idea of the creation of a single european state in the place of the current nation states so everytime an american says `` football '' , you assume he 's talking about what * you * ( and i ) call football , and not take into account what he may think is the meaning of the word ? 
  are n't there also 50 millions romanians and bulgarians ready to take uk jobs ? 
  jeez , dude . 
  yes , they 've said stuff like `` only south american and european teams left '' , `` south american teams are playing aggressively '' , `` south american teams have done well with the 5 back line '' , but still i 'm certain they ( the tv people working with the wc ) could place costa rica on a map . 
  it 's just the differentiation between latin america and south america that 's confusing things . 
  many norwegian might say `` north america '' is just canada and the us , while in this case concacaf is the caribbean , north and central america . 
  and that said , norwegians can be as ignorant on general knowledge as anybody else . 
  i 'm the first to be annoyed of people 's lack of basic science , important facts , or awful grammar . 
  i 've cut out a question in the paper about why we have leap year . 
  how many knew the answer ? 
  none . 
  our education system is mainly targeted to give everyone * a fair chance * at -- not forced to -- getting higher education ( and most people do ) , but that does n't mean everybody has a higher degree , quite the opposite . 
  it 's impressive how many times costa rica -- directly or indirectly -- is called a south american team , at least by the norwegian broadcasters . 
  i hope that includes the whole eea . 
  you might get better answers in / r/askeurope -- you 'll probably get downvoted here . 
  i was in argentina last year , so for me it 's buenos aires ( where i went ) , wine and steak . 
  damn , that meat was good . 
  i actually first heard about the white/european thing just recently , but now it 's baader-meinhof-ing for me . 
  other than my own visit , it 's the falklands , maradona , and that your current president is cristina fern\u00e1ndez . 
  well , if they 're `` religious nut jobs '' or '' * new age * religious nut jobs '' does n't really matter to me ; although mine were maybe a bit to mild to be called `` nut jobs '' ? 
  at least compared to your carlos jes\u00fas . 
  just `` crazy '' maybe suffices . 
  edit : both * sn\u00e5samannen * and m\u00e4rtha louise have a solid basis in their christian/lutheran religion , so they 're actually not entirely new age . 
  i do n't know if this is what you 're looking for , but we do have [ * sn\u00e5samannen * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joralf_gjerstad ) ( `` the man from sn\u00e5sa '' ) . 
  he claims he 's healing people with his `` warm hands '' , and several famous people ( including politicians ) believe he does . 
  it 's kind of annoying , because he 's all over the news papers , and especially the tabloids , and a lot of people seem to believe in him . 
  our dear [ princess m\u00e4rtha louise ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m\u00e4rtha_louise ) believes she can talk to angels , and have started an `` angel school '' . 
  sounds pretty surreal , but people believe that stuff too . 
  because of doing business with the angel school , she has now ( partly ? ), 
  given up her royal titles . 
  i 've found a report from [ university of oslo ] ( https://www.jus.uio.no/ikrs/forskning/prosjekter/holdningertilstraff/rapporten_lpo.pdf ) . 
  it 's in norwegian , and i 'll mention the graph on page 50 : people generally ** believe ** the sentences are a way , way ** lower ** than they are . 
  they usually propose ** a bit lower ** sentence than they are . 
  so in general sentences are harder than people think they should . 
  look further on some of them ( * straffeniv\u00e5 * = `` sentence level '' , * antatt niv\u00e5 * = `` expected level '' , * foresl\u00e5tt niv\u00e5 * = `` proposed level '' ) : * gatevold * ( `` street violence '' ) : people proposes a punishment just slightly harder than it really is . 
  * voldtekt * ( rape ) : slightly less than what the sentences really are . 
  hope that answers your question . 
  ** ps ** : [ this article ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/straffenivaet-bor-ikke-heves-7372916.html ) talks about this result , and may be easier to google translate than the whole report .
