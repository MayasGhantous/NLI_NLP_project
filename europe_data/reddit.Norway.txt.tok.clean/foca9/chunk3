  ** btw ** : sorry if my english is bad here , i 'm not really familiar with talking legal stuff in english ... 
  i might have heard it several times , but i 'm certain i 've heard in on the radio programme * ekko * on norwegian radio . 
  i 'm looking for it . 
  do you think there is a possibility that the conservative party will split up ? 
  or do the british parties ( as they exist in a fptp system ) have enough room for colliding views internally that it will keep together ? 
  the thinking thing sounds interesting . 
  would like to hear more about that . 
  and by the way , barnevernet is n't actually robbing kids for no reason . 
  in my view , the problem is that they get shit whatever they do ( damned if you do , damned if you do n't ) . 
  if people are asked `` should the sentences be longer ? '', 
  they answer `` yes '' , but are people asked `` what should the sentence be ? '', 
  for a particular offence , they answer a shorter sentence than you actually get . 
  it 's difficult to say , but i think this shows it 's pretty on the line on what people experience as good punishment . 
  heard an interview with his nephew yesterday . 
  he was proud of his uncle , and found it funny that it is the story of the loser who 's stuck , although he was n't bitter , as he 's had a good life . 
  the end of the interview was interesting ( reciting from my memory , of course ) : interviewer : `` how do you keep peace the next 100 years ? '', 
  the nephew : `` i can tell you how to keep peace the next 500 years . 
  by economical and cultural co-operation , protect the minorities , and we will live in peace and harmony . '', 
  i do n't really have a meaning about gavrilo princip anyway , nor do i feel i should ; as always , one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . 
  just because `` no one '' / you have n't heard of the meps , does n't mean they 're not democratically elected . 
  just because some of them are far-right , does n't mean they 're not democratically elected . 
  just because some of them oppose federalisation , does n't mean they 're not democratically elected . 
  that some of them oppose federalisation might even be evidence for it -- everyone can vote for whomever they want , regardless if they oppose the body of government they voting to . 
  whether or not `` it sounds democratic '' ( to you ) is totally irrelevant . 
  if you go by which sounds more democratic of `` republic of korea '' and `` democratic people 's republic of korea '' , you 're gon na get disappointed . 
  because a backroom deal between merkel and cameron is the more democratic way of choosing the comission president . 
  have been a big , big fan of germany since 2006 . 
  although they 'll end up losing in the semi finals , and win the third place match , hopefully we 'll still see results like 4 -- 0 against argentina ( 2010 ) , several goals from thomas m\u00fcller , and miroslav klose surpassing ronaldo as world cup top scorer . 
  then i 'm pleased , although i 'd love for the team to win . 
  they 've been extremely consistent ( 2nd , 3rd , 3rd in the last three world cups ) . 
  i 'm also a fan of mexico . 
  this year i did n't expect much of them -- considering the qualifications and all the manager changes -- but damn , they 've been great . 
  so that 's how you 're going to get yourself into the nordics . 
  i think i agree with you . 
  out of curiosity , as a fellow norwegian : do you want stronger european cooperation between the nation states , or a combined eu army of some sort ( and/or norway in the eu ) ? 
  you know , there might be a third option between nato and putin 's eurasian union . 
  for example , an eu army . 
  no american troops does not equal whatever putin does . 
  it does in norwegian too ( * fagott * ) . 
  i 'm going to guess that some version of * fagot * is what more or less everybody calls it , except in english ; much like pineapple / * ananas * . 
  yes , sir . 
  as the female singer is from my hometown , i feel we 're partly responsible . 
  `` it costs too much '' is not exactly the only argument against monarchy . 
  and what you mentioned may be the only two arguments * for * monarchy ( `` it 's good to have a non-political symbol '' and `` people want it '' ) . 
  the highest power in norway is hereditary . 
  the members of the royal family lacks normal rights like the right to vote , ca n't work with whatever they want , have no religious freedom , marriage needs the king 's consent . 
  the monarchy is based on a referendum in 1905 , where only men had the right to vote . 
  the money stuff is the last thing i care about , but sure , that should be an argument as well . 
  the king is `` holy '' , ca n't be held accountable . 
  m\u00e4rtha 's angel business , mette-marit 's surrogate thing . 
  for me , it 's no doubt . 
  the monarchy is anachronistic , and does not belong in a modern society . 
  but of course , he 's ( they 're ) hugely popular . 
  and the kingdom of norway is going to stand as it is for many years more . 
  but that does n't make it any more `` right '' , in a principle , liberal and democratic sense . 
  you 're free to think it 's nice to have a royal family , but in my view , there are n't any sensible , objective arguments to keep the monarchy . 
  we by the way already did write a new constitution this year : made some changes , and then translated it into two new versions . 
  i meant that a monarchy debate should have happened as we 're celebrating a constitution that were extremely liberal and modern in 1814 . 
  i think it 's more or less the same in norway . 
  surely has to be a referendum to support it , and to change the constitution , a proposition has to be put forth in one parliament ( during its four-year period ) , and be voted through by a 2/3 majority in the next parliament ( after an election ) . 
  i 'm sure , if a referendum says yes to abolish the monarchy , it will happen . 
  and i think a referendum is the only way to abolish it ; no politician would touch the royal family unless the public wants it . 
  they 're very popular , and a clear majority want to keep the monarchy as this point . 
  a monarchy debate never catches on , and is usually just among ( individual ) politicians , commentators , etc. 
  i hope a referendum , or better , an abolishment of the spanish monarchy , will spark a debate here . 
  i 'm all for the republic of norway . 
  we should have had a debate about it in this 200 year anniversary for our constitution . 
  btw : the most republican party , socialist left party ( and additional individuals ) , always proposes abolition of the monarchy each year when the storting meets for the first time in the autumn . 
  ** edit : ** btw 2 : i 'm currently reading a new book , * republikken norge * ( '' * republic of norway * '' ) by political commentator kjetil b. alstadheim , which explores the debate . 
  i 'm already republican , so it 's not exactly changing my view , but i still find it interesting , and it 's well written . 
  for me , it 's [ nrk ] ( http://www.nrk.no ) or [ aftenposten ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no ) . 
  i really dislike the tabloids . 
  although , at least [ vg ] ( http://www.vg.no ) is better than [ dagbladet ] ( http://www.dagbladet.no ) . 
  do n't really want to read about tics and how i 'm gon na die * all * the time . 
  damn , that second spanish republic flag is really beautiful . 
  i wish so many people wanted the end of the norwegian monarchy . 
  i 'd love for spain to change , which would spark some ( more ) debate over here too . 
  our recent 200 year celebration of our constitution and a new book on the subject did something , but it 's mainly individual commentators or politicians who speaks up about it now . 
  the book club sounds interesting , but i 'm a practitioner of [ * tsundoku * ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/\u7a4d\u3093\u8aad ) , so i have enough to get through first ... 
  eea members are basically eu members . 
  we just do n't have a say . 
  ( okay , we also control agriculture and fisheries ourselves . ), 
  is n't melilla an ** ex ** clave ? 
  yeah , it 's scary that elderly are such a important demographic , when they are n't going to face problems like climate change anyway , 
  sure , i was just trying to explain that that 's what happened here . 
  clear majority against in norway , but oslo said yes , and the referendum only took place in oslo . 
  which means they said yes to something we all have to pay for , but they 're the only ones that want it . 
  would you think the result would be fair if the whole country is against , but cracovians said yes ? 
  yes , of course , association fallacy goes both ways . 
  that still does n't make it more correct in any sense . 
  hitler wanted a part of poland . 
  stalin wanted a part of poland . 
  hitler = ( literally ) = stalin, 
  you know , right-wingers are literally hitler . 
  left-wingers are literally stalin . 
  and as you know , hitler was a national socialist , which means he was literally a communist . 
  so ** everyone ** 's a communist !, 
  although the biggest party in government is currently for the oslo olympics , and we could get a majority in another way . 
  but i do n't think it 's likely , especially with the public opinion . 
  the whole process just stinks ( especially the process from troms\u00f8 2018 to oslo 2022 ) , and a lot of norwegians are really tired of the corrupt ioc .
