  the referendum we had , was for oslo only . 
  the majority of norwegian is against , and it 's growing , but we do n't directly have had a say in the matter . 
  but one of the parties in government has said no , so we 'll see . 
  yes , that 's correct , but the referendum we had , was * only * for people in oslo , and it was a narrow yes lead . 
  therefore the bid is sent , but the government has to agree to it as well later . 
  luckily one of the parties in government has said no . 
  to whom ? 
  jeez , what is even this ? 
  guilt by association ? 
  this is such an awful logic . 
  damnit , then we 're closer to oslo 2022 . 
  so you mean anti-israel = = anti-semittism ? 
  most people criticising israel are not hating jews . 
  maybe he had responded to [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/rtorvelainen/status/470493744933142528 ) ? 
  sitting at home wo n't exactly do anything either !, 
  i always wonder if non-voters rather want to have a dictator . 
  any special , slovak reasons for the low turnout ? 
  are they ( this ) low in national elections too ? 
  well , it is the evening of the european parliamentary election ! ^ ( ^ go ^ eu ), 
  i should n't , but : english is not the only thing that 's hard in the evening ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  yeah , sure , i 'm not a big fan of wing parties of any kind , but we hear about the rise of the far right now . 
  a rise of both wings are better than just a rise of one wing , because that means that the centre of the political spectrum is still at the same place . 
  thanks for the answer !, 
   the eu are just not considered to be important to the lives of french people that could possibly be said for most of eu citizens , it seems . 
  do you know of any recent polls of the french people 's view of the eu in general ? 
  you and denmark are kind of the closest we are to have european representation , so i 'm happy ( for you ) to see that the greens are doing well , although alde have lost some . 
  interesting that the feminists did as well as sd . 
  do you think the turnout would be higher if you had one national list , which for you meant you had a pirate party representative to vote for ? 
  or do you prefer to have the electoral districts ? 
  yup , and we were ** two ** minutes away from a 1 -- 0 atl\u00e9tico madrid victory . 
  we * also * ca n't have an honest debate about immigration because a lot of people ( you seem to among them ) just screams `` political correctness '' every time somebody disagrees with them and/or argues against them . 
  we 're 5 million . 
  the danish population spread out on the area of germany . 
  in addition it 's very mountainous . 
  it 's getting better , but we do n't exactly need autobahn everywhere . 
  wrong , german meps have more votes behind them than the smaller countries . 
  sure , sure , language is not the issue it that sense . 
  of course this also involves rights to the films and tv series . 
  it should be a `` common market '' of that type of rights in the eu . 
  i guess it 's not because languages and tv channels are usually divided between or based in the member countries . 
  if the entertainment industry is to `` stop '' illegal downloading , i think they have to change this type of restrictions . 
  hbo nordic have it available the day after the us , but of course only in the nordic countries . 
  i think they do one relatively small group of countries at the time , and go for a few things : language , ability to pay , and the `` technology density '' ( a great norwegian word i just translated , * teknologitetthet * , do n't know if it exists in english ) . 
  when they launched in the nordics in 2012 , the logic behind was that they are relatively rich countries , and we have high internet capacity and accessibility , and a high percentage of people own laptops , tablets , etc. 
  the netherlands , 2013 , is also a country were people use the internet a lot . 
  although the language part is n't that relevant in the nordics ( four different languages ) , you could attribute it to this expansion . 
  they probably want to access the big countries here -- germany and france -- while the others -- austria , switzerland , belgium , and luxembourg -- are natural countries to include because large proportion of those countries ' people speak german and/or french . 
  i get your point ( and now really take it seriously because of that reply ) , but you 're probably only downvoted because of your tone in the comment . 
  if you were `` more patient '' , more people would , as i will , remember to think about the colours if they ever post a map here . 
  even if you are colour blind , that tone makes you ( sound like ) an asshole . 
  but you 're a bit happy if scotland beat england ? 
  i think you should vote . 
  at least vote for me !, 
  i ca n't , even though eu legislation affect me too . 
  i do n't exactly watch eurovision for its quality ... 
  ugh , no . 
  you should be a candidate . 
  it was n't totally undeserved . 
  i think that 's all you can hope for in this competition . 
  i still think it 's hilarious when serious news presenters , in prime time on television , say `` pussy riot '' . 
  i agree with you . 
  reminded me of the opening ceremony of the 2008 olympics . 
  during georgia 's entrance , dead silence . 
  russia 's , there were booing . 
  i think it is ignorant to say that there are no politics in this . 
  it clearly is . 
  just look at the voting . 
  austria winning also made this whole thing really interesting . 
  now i actually want to see the reactions . 
  will russia not participate next year ? 
  yeah , it was pilou asb\u00e6k that was funny . 
  and the average dane speaking english . 
  the accent is n't bad , it just sounds funny ( to me , or to us ) . 
  but fogh rasmussen is really hilarious . 
  yeah , it was n't * that * bad . 
  especially not in this context . 
  when we had a funny commentator , people reacted like crazy , and she were n't allowed to continue . 
  we now have an okay , but kind of boring , guy . 
  he good at it , but nothing more . 
  that 's cool !, 
  i actually want to do my year abroad in germany ( engineering , so not understandable , and i want to learn german ) , and i 've heard lots of great things about erasmus !, 
  we do n't have any , either . 
  * kleint * is more the mood between people when it 's embarrassing . 
  we also have the idiom `` embarrassed on his/her behalf '' which might be the closest . 
  the problem with your finnish words is that they 're impossible to remember ... , 
  ** by the way ** , how did you know ? 
  we you studying in trondheim last fall , or are you still there ? 
  hey , maybe estonia * can * into nordic ? 
  that word exists in norwegian !, 
  the only * skadefryd * i get from this is when the uk gets 0 points . 
  and maybe denmark and sweden , but we kind of love it when they win too . 
  i saw it now !, 
  they should 've used it for something . 
  if it helps , the german song is one of the few songs i could listen to again . 
  i really liked it . 
  like-liked it , not eurovision-liked it . 
  it reminded of an awful cover of '' [ hopeless wanderer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rid6pkldxeu ) '' by mumford & sons . 
  i do n't know about you , but to me/us danes speaking english sound hilarious . 
  though not as funny as anders fogh rasmussen . 
  hahaha !,
