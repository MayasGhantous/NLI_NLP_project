  i missed that , but i 'll be sure to check the short clip later !, 
  [ i 'm just posting this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd0yab-zjog ) . 
  german song on `` eurovision '' in a norwegian revue last autumn . 
  this would have won the real thing . 
  ^ ( ^ i ^ just ^ learnt ^ this ^ word ^ earlier ^ today ), 
  i think there 's moron parties in every country . 
  yours are just easily spotted because everybody understands english , and you have a lively debate on eu right now . 
  but i 'll agree , you have some moron parties , no doubt  edit : okay , that video was worse than i thought . 
  well , it wo n't get * more * attention by parties not sending a candidate . 
  but the euroskeptics or populists are probably better off by not participating , and then complain about lack of democracy and lack of an anti-eu candidate . 
  they wo n't get the commission president anyway ( and juncker does n't want their support , it seems ) , so they 'll rather gain more by not showing up . 
  if they really were serious about want they think is wrong in the eu , they would try to get the power that could change it . 
  but what do you expect from a populist . 
  ... and beer ? 
  you 're not doing that bad , 2nd , 3rd , 3rd the last world cups ? 
  2nd and 3rd in the last euros ? 
  * always * among the best ; it 's not many that are so consistent . 
  but yeah , you 're often best during the group stage . 
   * fremdsch\u00e4men * that 's a great word !, 
  always loved how you watch a game in public like that . 
  as a germany fan , it would be cool to try it during the world cup . 
   public viewing like you do with football matches ? 
  is n't that exactly how ioc works as well ? 
  not all the groups have/will put forward a candidate , so they 're naturally not a part of the candidate debates . 
  the left ( eul -- ngl ) has also a candidate , alexis tsipras , but he has n't participated ( yet ) . 
  not sure why . 
  do n't forget danish and norwegian !, 
  bokm\u00e5l is pretty far away from danish now anyhow . 
  our constitution , on the other hand ... 
  yes , a political union consisting of freely participating countries is certainly going to cause the same conflict as the europe pre-1914 and pre-1939 . 
  if the chinese sees the peace prize ( to liu xiaobo ) as the norwegian government 's opinion/award , it should be their problem , not ours . 
  is it just my view , or has this government has caused more controversy -- even in the general public -- its first six months , than the last caused in eight years ? 
  a lot of people online also claim that climate change is a hoax , chemtrails , illuminati , vaccination causes autism , etc. 
  read it at 16 . 
  kind of became a pacifist after that . 
  ^ ( ^ hush !, 
  ^ it 's ^ supposed ^ to ^ be ^ a ^ secret ), 
  i think it 's easier for a person editing the map , so they just know that that island belong to that country , and do n't have to look it up every time , i guess . 
  i 've seen it on a lot of maps on wikipedia . 
  svalbard is often connected to mainland norway , so they both `` change colour '' when editing . 
  i 've also shared bed with my best friend , who is of the opposite sex . 
  not any family member over the age of maybe 10 , although i do n't think it would be that awkward . 
  this is [ glorious ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gzdv14r.png ) . 
  i think the only thing we can do is make dialects normal , encouraged , and not be frowned upon . 
  the worst is when people change their dialect because they 're embarrassed or do n't want to draw attention , rather than to be understood . 
  world news is not fond of the eu ? 
  not really familiar with the subreddit . 
  ah , did n't cross my mind . 
  i saw that when i was a kid ( i 'm 20 , so not exactly the original airing i guess ) , so i do n't remember much from it . 
  it 's still on where the [ live feed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhafgcpexes ) was . 
  i saw the first half or something . 
  i 'm biased too , but verhofstadt seemed the most interested , and actually wanted to win some voters . 
  he argued very well for most of his views . 
  he also put out new subjects which won me even more over ( * surely i ca n't vote anyway * ) . 
  the people in the room seemed to be young people , which may be the people he wanted to speak to the most anyway , more than the others ? 
  keller too , perhaps . 
  [ do n't mention the war . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3yyzr6el3m ), 
  we do n't receive babies and make them our own kind !, 
  wait . 
  adoption . 
  you were first on gay marriage ? 
  and people often point at you when talking about drugs . 
  because romanian is a romance language , so i 'd guess it rather means ` sea ' , as * mar * in spanish ? 
  most people learning norwegian as adults never quite learn the `` singing '' , because it 's so complex . 
   i think president of the commission should select their commission themselves which i guess you also mean the commission should n't necessarily consist of a commissioner from each country ? 
  just enough to make sense ( for the president of the commission ) . 
  agree with you on the rest . 
  is n't some of problem people have with the eu that the commission does n't exactly `` answer '' to anyone today ? 
  like i were n't angry/sad enough by the dalai lama thing , this did n't help . 
  are voters of the independence party ( or the party itself ) pro-eu ? 
  or will this mean that they 'll `` move '' to a pro-eu party ? 
  * [ ignorance intensifies ] *, 
  for a second i thought i was on my front page and this was a / r/nottheonion post . 
  a question to test people 's definition of europe . 
  fellow students of mine did a revue last autumn , in which there were a parody of eurovision . 
  the spanish song was something like this : '' * por favor , mi amor * do n't vote for us we ca n't afford to win this year . '', 
  children do the giant rabbit thing , or at least go looking for the candy hidden somewhere . 
  i 'm 20 , but i still get candy in a big egg , but do n't do the hunt . 
  i do n't complain . 
  you 're at home ? 
  i 'm skiing in the mountains this easter ( well , * every * easter ) , and the largest nationality here are swedes , behind you are us norwegians , and danes ( who can blame them and their ~ 170 metres ) . 
  and all the employees here are swedish , of course  easter is solely an opportunity to go skiing , cross-country or slalom . 
  celebration includes more or less eating candy labeled ` easter ' . 
  thursdag , friday , and monday are all ` red days ' or holidays , which means most people have some time off even if they do n't take the whole week/monday -- wednesday off as well ( which is pretty normal ) . 
  my line of thought : i think contraceptions are important . 
  a less ` modern ' and/or a more religious country would also mean less contraceptions are available . 
  that way the rate of abortions may go up instead . 
  i did n't know it exists !, 
  i think i just found my favourite subreddit ( after / r/europe , * of course * ) . 
  you deserve more upvotes . 
  i agree with that . 
  we get all the legislation , but no say in making them . 
  still do n't get how people think the eea is a good thing ... 
  it began telling how i think it 's unnecessary , but if that was n't clear enough , then i 'm sorry . 
  i just found it weird that you were attacking me for dst , i just do n't really get how one hour messed up people sleeping schedule . 
  i really do agree with everything you said in that comment . 
   although i think we do n't need it anymore your whole comment was about how we should abolish it . 
  i agree . 
  why are you telling me this ?
