  it clearly seems we agree . 
  although i think we do n't need it anymore , i agree , i do n't really get the argument about sleeping schedule . 
  it 's night to sunday , * one * hour . 
  should not be a big deal for most people . 
  go to sleep * one * earlier if it 's a problem for you . 
  the newspapers think this is really funny , while i do n't really know many people doing any jokes or pranks . 
  this routine every year : 1 . 
  newspapers have an article about the best april fool jokes of all time . 
  newspapers have an awful and/or easily spotted april fool joke . 
  newspapers report the good april fool jokes other newspapers or tv or radio channels have done today . 
  also norwegian , have never tried it . 
  do n't know if any of my friends have , but some most probably have . 
  but agree , i would n't exactly oppose it or freak out if i knew someone who did it , or if somebody brought it to a party . 
  it changes so much it 's not worth it anyway , in my opinion . 
  southern norway : around winter solstice the sun 's up from 9 to 15 , and during the summer the sun just dips under the horizon at night and it does n't really get very dark . 
  above the polar circle , it 's completely dark in the winter , and midnight sun during the summer . 
  from what i 've read ( which is norwegian media ) , it 's that there 's still a high unemployment rate , and the fact that hollande and the government has n't really been able to fix the economy . 
  i do n't about britain , but the norwegian monarch has legal immunity , and he vetoed a proposed change in the constitution a couple of years ago . 
  that kind of privileges should not belong to any person in a liberal democracy , and that kind of powers should not belong to a person * who is not even elected * . 
  okay , haha !, 
  i always try and look presentable for exactly that reason : in case you meet someone you wish you 'd look presentable for , and/or find the love of your life ( i wish ) . 
  do n't do the fashion show , though , 
   many voters are pretty stupid . 
  amen . 
  wow . 
  that 's just like our king . 
  just you actually got to elect your head of state . 
  do not really like people in power having that . 
  yey , they know we exist !, 
  we 're part of things !, 
  it 's normal to keep plastic bags from a grocery store to use as in trash cans here as well . 
  and `` dressing up to go to the store etc. '' ? 
  is n't it normal to look presentable and freshen up when you are in public ? 
  this sounds like it belongs in / r/nottheonion ... 
  why not scotland and northern ireland ? 
  okay , wikipedia tells me scotland is later this year . 
  did scotland ( the parliament ) have its own legislation , and that 's why they 're doing it later ? 
  northern ireland ~ ~ do ~ ~ does not want ? 
  religious protest ? 
  that 's the impression i had before and/or got tonight . 
  farage is a good rhetoric and always good at debates . 
  clegg was better with facts . 
  and i think i would agree with people saying both won . 
  farage may have won the debate , but the real losers are tory and labour -- which probably benefit clegg . 
  now that 's a more logical train of thought than what i understood . 
  thanks . 
  any thoughts on the debate from you brits ? 
  how do you view farage and clegg compared to how they usually do it in debates ? 
  as a pro-eu outsider * and * liberal , i 'm biased enough . 
  though that may be true for everyone in a eu debate ... the arguments are at least recognisable from the debate here . 
  farage thinks the eu/europe has blood on its hands in ukraine because you/they ( / we ? ), 
  angered putin ? 
  okay . 
  immediately reminds me of sosialistisk venstreparti ( sv ; * socialist left party * ) in norway and socialistisk folkeparti ( sf ; * socialist people 's party * ) in denmark . 
  while sv never left the stoltenberg ii coalition ( 2005 -- 2013 ) , some members heavily opposed parts of its politics , and many `` experts '' expected them to leave . 
  in denmark , sf left thorning-schmidt 's coalition earlier this year . 
  it is not certain that he will be , though i agree he is very popular , and my favourite too . 
  giske is popular among nho , for example . 
  and i do n't know about unions . 
  he has been the leader and prime minister for ~ 10 years . 
  no way a change will * strengthen * them . 
  if stoltenberg had continued until 2017 , i 'm certain they would win the election . 
  now they have to change , adapt . 
  it can be all good , of course , but i do not think so after so many years of one leader as good and uniting as stoltenberg . 
  exciting to see how this will affect norwegian politics . 
  it will possibly weaken arbeiderpartiet towards the 2017 election , and the party in general . 
  and exciting to see who the new leader will be . 
  i 'm not sure , but the last time i saw this , it did n't . 
  i really hope it will . 
  edit : norwegian sources : [ e24 ] ( http://e24.no/digital/eu-vil-fjerne-roaming-utgiftene/21604636 ) does n't write anything about eea , but [ tu ] ( http://www.tu.no/it/2013/05/30/na-skal-roaming-utgiftene-vekk ) and [ nrk ] ( http://www.nrk.no/livsstil/eu-vil-kappe-roamingprisene-1.11238037 ) says it will . 
  it 's not just that perspective . 
  it 's also the whole process . 
  * all the people voting for troms\u00f8 the last round against oslo , were sacked to the next `` idrettstyret '' . 
  * only the people in oslo were allowed to vote on this , while * everybody * else have to pay for it as well . 
  * the oslo games are supposedly more expensive than the troms\u00f8 games would have been . 
  in addition : * we spent 12 million nok on a house in sochi where the members of the ioc could eat , drink and look a pictures of norway ( e.g. 
  northern lights * from troms\u00f8 * ) . 
  * the ioc is an awful organisation : for example it takes all the income from companies sponsoring it , while the host is stuck with paying for the whole thing . 
  no , thank you . 
  no worries . 
  your description is the kind of poll that should have been presented with the characterisation used here . 
  you 're completely right , by the way . 
  because * this is not an official poll * . 
  it 's a poll from a news article ... my numbers are n't that good either , but taken from what i remember from some official one a month ago or so . 
  the ioc ( and gerhard heiberg ) has made norwegian turn against them and oslo 2022 during the sochi games . 
  you 're completely right , but this is unfortunately a poll from a news paper article . 
  so it 's not exactly a good scientific study . 
  there was 51/49 vote in * oslo * , while in the rest of the country people against are in strong majority , and it 's stronger the further away from oslo you get ( i.e. 
  in the rest of country , maybe ~ 35 % is for ? 
  i would say massive opposition , though i agree this poll is not a good statistic to justify that characterisation . 
  edit : ... because it 's a poll from a news article . 
  it was cool . 
  it showed how the eu needed norway ( when it 's actually the other way around ) . 
  do n't feel bad for `` scandinavian '' at least , it 's practically the same language . 
  as you might know , we can speak to each other in our own language . 
  we are best at understanding danish * and * swedish , while they both think norwegian is the easiest to understand . 
  this has a natural explanation , considering our history ( norway 's been a part of both of them ) . 
  i speak some spanish , so i can easily know if it 's spanish or catalan . 
  but then again i know what to look for . 
  i would think a lot of norwegian could recognise ( as a lot of people are in spain on vacation ) if it 's not spanish , but e.g.
