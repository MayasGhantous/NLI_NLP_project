  catalan . 
  also because spanish is probably the most popular choice as the third language we are taught in school . 
  would like to hear what a non-spanish speaking and non-spain traveling scandinavian would answer , though !, 
  `` why should i vote , my * one * vote does n't make any difference anyway . '', 
  i would vote for the european party of my party in norway ( * obviously * i ca n't vote , of course ) , but it also depends on how you view each party 's politics . 
  you can agree on radikale venstre 's politics on national matters , and pes on european matters , i would think . 
  although you probably know more about this than me anyway . 
  hypothetically i would vote for the norwegian sister party of radikale venstre ( venstre ) , which means alde . 
  but you 'll have to look into it by yourself . 
  you could think more tactically as well . 
  i would guess socialdemokraterne/pes will get meps anyway , so it 's more important to help radikale get one ? 
  * perfekt * svar . 
  norway approve this . 
  man , if i may say so , this is so beautiful . 
  iirc , bergen was bigger when oslo was chosen as capital , and since then oslo has grown bigger . 
  sweden , please . 
  we have a party practically dedicated to eradicate wolves , 
  as a norwegian learning spanish , i 've always loved how noruega sounds , too !, 
  there 's actually a lot of beautiful words in spanish in general . 
  of the top of my head , the seasons has amazed me ( of course one of the first types of words you learn ) , like primavera . 
  view it as a complete joke -- unless your country win . 
  everybody says they do n't watch it , but the majority do . 
  that 's my impression and/or personal experience ... 
  first , i do n't really care about the tourism . 
  that 's not why i do n't want it . 
  it 's more about all the stuff leading up to this candidacy . 
  i can expand later , if you 'd like ( on my phone right now ) . 
  i agree on the tourism part , but i feel your point is a bit contradicting ? 
  should n't a country that would appreciate the tourism host it rather than a country that can host , but does n't appreciate it ? 
  on the other hand , why should now norway host it ? 
  we 're a small country , and the olympics our second time in 1994 . 
  your country had it in 1992 . 
  germany in 72 . 
  switzerland ? 
  sweden ? 
  is it really our turn ? 
  i do n't want/trying to bitch about this , 'cause i really do get your point , but i do n't really feel that we 've never done our bit . 
  that 's one of the reasons i 'm against . 
  that whole business . 
  i 'm not against the olympics in norway in general , but everything so far about the oslo 2022 has been so much bullshit i do n't want it . 
  hope we do n't get this . 
  plz . 
  i apologise for my countrymen / - women who do this . 
  i hate them too !, 
  maybe ? 
  i do say `` hi '' and `` goodbye '' * if * i get on/off at the front door ( where the driver 's seated ) . 
  but i do n't think the majority do even that . 
  we are all [ * same * ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/same.jpg ) ? 
  ( same in norway ) . 
  we just do n't . 
  people will think you 're weird . 
  you only sit next to a person if there 's no free two-seaters . 
  we do n't even say anything when we 're going off the bus . 
  we just give subtle hints . 
  agree with everything you said !, 
  and perhaps the us would have `` won '' if they were included . 
  yeah , for the most part , maybe , but that does n't make me dislike russians * in general * . 
  i 'll gladly dislike any russian ( or person of any nationality ) if s/he proves her - / himself to be an asshole , 
  some [ norwegians ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ) . 
  i think people do n't like your * country * ( putin , anti-gay legislation , some corruption , etc. ) . 
  i do not think people dislike russians in general . 
  [ reminded me of this . 
  germany is most people 's favourite country ? 
  nice . 
  you deserve it , though , it certainly is mine as well !, 
  ( norway in 2nd , tied with france . 
  love you too ! ), 
  i might have been exaggerating , but it is a concern . 
  on the other hand , the oil fund ( pension fund ) is our way of dealing with the dutch disease . 
  [ this speech ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f6geivdwpk ) from our former prime minister ( and the creator of our dutch disease avoider , [ the budgetary rule ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_budgetary_rule ) \\ ) is a good explanation , i think . 
  we 're doing a lot of renewable energy ; our electricity is ~ 100 % hydropower , but also wind , researching other types , etc. 
  we can be a `` green battery '' for europe 's wind and/or solar energy , because we can store energy in our hydropower dams/plants ( or what they 're called ) , which wind and solar ca n't . 
  so i think i 'm not that concerned about our ability to adapt , i 'm more concerned that we 're not ** willing ** to do enough fast enough , especially in concern of the environment and climate change , or maybe if the oil prices would fall * rapidly * . 
  ( sorry , my comments always seem to become this long ) . 
  ** edit : ** errors and clarification . 
  no , i do n't think so , but we 're ( 1 ) more concerned about oil not being the world 's biggest source of energy anymore , and losing to renewable energy . 
  our economy is quite split between the oil business and industry working for/with the oil , and the rest of our economy , the `` on-shore economy '' ( which i think would be the best translation ) . 
  the problem is that so many people are employed in , and so much of our income is based upon that oil economy , that we would get in trouble if it oil prices decline or we ca n't adapt fast enough to a renewable based energy market . 
  even though we do a lot of renewable energy , oil and gas is still very important . 
  and ( 2 ) , we are , especially young people ( young politicians , maybe ) are concerned our oil fund ( formally called pension fund ) will run out . 
  this is estimated to happen in 2060 , which means when people of age ~ 30 will retire . 
  today 's `` grown-up '' politicians wo n't really touch this subject , even though it 's their prediction , because it will mean we 'll have to cut our spending , which means cut in welfare . 
  and nobody would dare do that . 
  sorry for the long post , hopefully i somehow managed to answer your question  these are important for me , at least ( being 20 and want to work in renewable energy ) , and i 'd guess this would make us more interested in joining the eu . 
  norway ** was ** one of europe 's poorest countries 100 years ago . 
  and it 's important to say both eu referendums were * very * tight !, 
  we already had that , did n't we , right after the election when international media was horrified that we elected the old party of you-know-who . 
  as you might read in my comment , i absolutely agree on what you say . 
  we 're just like any other eu member , but all our influence ( ~ nothing ) is only based on lobbying . 
  i 'll add i think many norwegians underestimate how positive the eea is for us . 
  i do n't know if this includes you ( sorry for generalising !, 
  ) , but where would our construction business be if not for the polish and lithuanian immigrants ? 
  these arguments ( i 've heard some of them from habermas , i think ) is the reason why i 've gone from unsure/no , to unsure/yes . 
  ... while we 're one of the most integrated countries , more so than many of the eu members . 
  and it 's not that we want to leave the eea , we 're happy with that . 
  we just do n't want to have a say . 
  in norway that 's not good enough . 
  we are ~ average , which is only bad in norwegian politics and general opinion . 
  i do not completely agree with that statement , but of course we could improve significantly . 
  i finished in 2012 , now a student .
