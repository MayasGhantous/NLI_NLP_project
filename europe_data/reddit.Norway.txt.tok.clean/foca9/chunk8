  what do you not like ? 
  my answer in the other comment was that i think we agree , but i do not agree with the sentence you wrote . 
  it 's not bad , but it could absolutely be better . 
  curious to know what 's terrible ? 
  we possibly agree on education . 
  i 'm amazed by the infrastructure thing . 
  how good can it be with population of denmark ( ~ finnmark ) spread out in the area of germany ? 
  agreed . 
  iirc norway 's one of the best countries to start a business in . 
  could absolutely be better , though . 
  [ found this . 
  agreed . 
  bonus : agreed . 
  edit : number 1 further explained : i think we might agree on this , but i do not agree with it being `` bad '' . 
  mostly history : * czechoslovakia was one of the few democratic states in central europe between the world wars . 
  * how it was born out of austria-hungary after wwi . 
  * we learned about how and why today 's czech republic was betrayed , occupied and split by nazi germany ( after the munich agreement ) . 
  * soviets troops going into the country sometime during the communist era . 
  * peaceful divorce with slovakia in 1993 . 
  other : * franz kafka in norwegian class ( as a part of literature periods ) . 
  i think it 's rather than norway contributing even more to climate change is not something we want to hear . 
  we 're doing enough already . 
  i thought 2nd place was the first of the losers ? 
    norway found oil in the adriatic sea , we 're gon na be rich !, 
  we did ? 
  nothing about this in norwegian media !, 
  i 'm ( we 're ) not a part of the eu , but i think it 's great you 're starting negotiations , and hopefully will join  do serbians in general want to join the eu , or is it just the politicians ? 
   denmark may become the first country to ban non therapeutic circumcisions of boys . 
  hopefully norway will follow . 
  we 've almost gotten no snow this winter ( and still is n't much ) , and as a norwegian that makes me depressed :( and christmas is not the same without a meter of snow . 
  yeah , this went better than the man one . 
  debatable . 
  * i like that you do !, 
  wish i 'd bother doing it myself ( and learning french ) . 
  i 'd rather not bring him and his actions to your mind , but [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders_behring_breivik ), 
  i really wish he was n't :(, 
  uhm , i 'd say it is * both * an anti-tax and anti-immigration party . 
  initially a anti-tax party , yes , but they 've changed since its founding . 
  many of the voters , and many of their politicians view immigration as their main most important issue ( i recently heard christian tybring-gjedde say that immigration * is the most important political issue in our time * , interview with danish radio programme * europa lige nu * yesterday ) . 
  granted , they 're not against * all * immigration , but to say that they 're * not * an anti-immigration party is n't correct . 
  from [ this * aftenposten * article ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/innvandring-viktigst-for-frp-tillitsvalgte-7313497.html ) , from after the election in 2013 : 61 % of people in the party says immigration is the most important , while 16,6 % says lower taxes . 
  yes . 
  the country 's split into the 19 * fylker * ( counties ) as voting districts , which has proportionated amounts of seats to the population ( it 's a bit more complex , as it takes area into account too ) . 
  i addition we have 19 leveling seats which gives seats to parties where the seats are n't corresponding ( enough ) to the national popular vote . 
  see the [ 2013 election result . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_parliamentary_election,_2013#results ) percentages are pretty close . 
  fair point . 
  also happy cakeday !, 
  i do n't know if it 's true , but hadia tajik ( labour party ) said that we could have built some in the existing prisons if they bothered , but rather we spent the time and resources trying to buy from sweden , and later the netherlands . 
  that would have been faster than a whole new prison would take . 
  afaik we just managed to remove the queues of people waiting for a place in prison ( i.e. 
  we built a lot of prisons ) before the terrorist attacks on 22 july 2011 . 
  then that type of policies in the ministry of justice was n't that interesting , now it was ( public ) security , anti terrorist laws , etc. 
  that was more important . 
  to illustrate this , the name of the ministry changed name from `` ministry of justice and police '' to `` ministry of justice and public security '' on 1 january 2012 . 
  in the last years the queues have grown back into a problem . 
  when / r/europe became a default subreddit ( for europeans ) , maybe ? 
  i do n't know if that was necessarily `` just '' german propaganda . 
  i 've heard norwegians talk about how they saw the future as a fight between two strong men ( hitler and stalin -- the others were weaker , i guess ) , and they felt like they had to choose . 
  that scene is so fucking scary, 
  this is one of the best , like , ever . 
  and the music !, 
  i can ( try ) spanish -- i 'm ~ ~ reading ~ ~ trying to read roberto bola\u00f1o in spanish right now . 
  * what 's a book ( novel ) you feel says something about spain , its history , its soul , its people and what it means to be spanish ? 
  ( for the interested , here 's [ portugal ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dya6h/portugal_country_week_thread/cta6bw5 ) , [ ireland ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ggvcg/ireland_\u00e9ire_country_of_the_week/cty5a5w ) ) * 1 ) \u00bf o `` diga '' ? 
  how 's the eu flag useless ? 
  some people here have two or more nationalities , or have lived in so many countries that a country flag does n't feel representative . 
  is puglia on level with ... equatorial guinea ? 
  holy shit . 
  that 's what i 've heard too, 
  ( i 'll repeat the question i had for the portugal one . 
  and probably will for all of these ) what 's a book ( novel ) you feel says something about ~ ~ portugal ~ ~ ireland , its history , its soul , its people and what it means to be ~ ~ portuguese ~ ~ irish ? 
   jesus what a bunch of useless people wished that was a more common view around here ... * leve republikken !, 
  yes , let 's give them several decades long sentences under harsh conditions , that 'll make them good people when they come back to society . 
  why should n't i believe all the non-swedes who tell me it 's a pc nazi feminist leftist muslim shithole ? 
  to be honest , i think this sub kind of has a problem with too much focus on the uk at times ( think anything eu referendum/brexit ) , because `` everybody '' can read those news . 
  not everybody can read about all those articles in norwegian media about 22/7 yesterday . 
  only articles in english would mean that we get focus on , the angle from , and the agenda set by ( mostly ) british , american , and irish newspapers ( exception : politico , maybe , though american ) . 
  the arguably most influential countries of the eu ( and therefore europe , i 'd say ) are france and germany . 
  nothing from these two countries ' media ? 
  the biggest news nowadays are greece and russia . 
  nothing from the greek newspapers ? 
  nothing from greeks ? 
  nothing from former eastern bloc countries on their feelings/fears of russian aggression ? 
  nothing from russian media except rt ( * dear god * ) ? 
  not to mention more vague concepts as diversity and multilingualism , which at least i see as important european values ( and / r/europe values ) . 
  i think it 's amazing that we can come together here in this subreddit and talk together ( in the same language ) , but this is the wrong way to go imo . 
  ( * i 'll applaud you for bringing it up , though , even if we disagree -- it is a debate we should have * ), 
  i have actually bought * the bridge on the drina * recently . 
  can i ask something ? 
  is ivo andri\u0107 considered a yugoslav writer or bosnian writer ( or both ) ? 
  how are culture such as this from the yugoslav period considered now ? 
  a joint , common history , or are the modern countries `` wanting '' to claim him or others as their own ? 
  i 'm thinking about how serbo-croatian is now serbian and croatian and bosnian . 
  a norwegian encyclopaedia is putting him under bosnia-herzegovinian literature , but says he 's a `` yugoslav author from bosnia '' . 
  combination of classics , popularity , and personal favourites ( i have n't read all ) : knut hamsun : * markens gr\u00f8de * ( eng : * growth of the soil * ) jostein gaarder : * sofies verden * ( * sophie 's world * ) sigrid undset : * kristin lavransdatter * lars saabye christensen : * beatles * dag solstad : * gymnasl\u00e6rer pedersen * i think knausg\u00e5rd 's * min kamp * ( * my struggle * ) and per petterson 's * ut og stj\u00e6le hester * ( * out stealing horses * ) could perfectly well end up on such a list in some time . 
  i also have a soft spot for gert nyg\u00e5rdshaug 's * mengele zoo * , but i do n't think it belongs on here . 
  great thread !, 
  i read this and recognise a bunch of films i want to see , and find even more .
