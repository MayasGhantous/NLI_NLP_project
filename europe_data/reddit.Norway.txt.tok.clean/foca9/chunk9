  then i remember why the list never gets smaller -- maybe two or three are available on the three streaming services i pay for . 
  is this the kind of stuff a digital single market could help improve ? 
  sure hope so . 
  one of mine are mentioned ( * der untergang * ) , but i 'll add * el orfanato * and * ex machina * . 
  and if it 's allowed : * the grand budapest hotel * -- at least partly funded by , filmed in and set in europe , and influenced by the works of stefan zweig , who * certainly * can be called `` european '' . 
  still remember first hearing about the explosion while at work . 
  still remember reading the first rumours about `` shooting on ut\u00f8ya '' . 
  still remember the first images of the island with bodies by the shore . 
  still remember waking up to the news of `` possible 100 dead '' the next day ( and how sick i felt right then ) . 
  still remember the speeches , especially by jens stoltenberg . 
  still remember the * rosetog * and [ * rosehavet * . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vj4rbrb.jpg ) ------- one thing to remember is that the camp consisted of people from all across norway . 
  everybody knew someone . 
  * `` vi er s\u00e5 f\u00e5 her i landet , hver fallen er bror og venn . '' * `` we are so few in this country , every fallen is a brother and a friend . '', 
  kind of more related -- i strongly hate national flags with wrong proportions ( this oftentimes happen to the belgian flag ) . 
  do you know any older/classic works that might fit ? 
  it does n't have to be recent -- especially not for a old country as portugal . 
  this is just a small project of mine , and for example the ( current ) choice for the u.s. is * great gatsby * ( from 1925 ) . 
  i 'm open for other opinions , even if they may go against my `` rules '' , 
  it has frequently come up in my searching , so i know of it , and i 'm certainly going to read it . 
  but as you say , not what i 'm looking for here . 
  thanks anyway , as i understand it pessoa deserves all the praise he gets !, 
  what 's a book ( novel ) you feel says something about portugal , its history , its soul , its people and what it means to be portuguese ? 
  i 've been looking , and jos\u00e9 saramago 's * the year of the death of ricardo reis * is my current choice ( reading it now ) , but i feel it might be too lisbon-centric . 
  sidenote : i had the pleasure to visit your country for the first time this summer , and i really enjoyed it . 
  loved lisbon , and algarve was really nice , though a bit too hot for my taste !, 
  i 'm a sucker for historic stuff ( i.e. 
  old buildings ) , so castelo de s\u00e3o jorge and sintra was my favourites . 
  at least this one 's got a separate norwegian text . 
  usually we 're just lumped together with danish , if we are mentioned at all . 
  if you have n't seen it already , [ check out him on * folkeopplysningen * ] ( https://tv.nrk.no/serie/folkeopplysningen/kmte50007212/sesong-2/episode-2 ) from last year ( from about 15:00 ) -- i wanted to include this , but afaik it 's only available in norway . 
  anyway he mostly just talks . 
  he says he used to wear the metal jacket when he sat in fylkestinget ( county council ) . 
  [ here 's a youtube video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7fudre8_q ) from the same programme , where he says ** `` it 's better to sit in a room where everybody 's smoking than in a room with radiation . 
  ** tor andr\u00e9 johnsen ** , mp from hedmark since 2013 ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tor_andr\u00e9_johnsen ) , though not much information ) . 
  he claims he suffers from electromagnetic hypersensitivity . 
  he gets a headache , gets dizzy and feels unwell when he is affected by radiation from mobile phones and wireless networks . 
  he also uses a metal shirt to shield himself . 
  ( [ source : * vg * ] ( http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/frp/frp-topp-bruker-metallskjorte-for-aa-unngaa-straaling/a/23309518/ ) ) ------ * bonus story * to make / r/europe love him even more : he 's been warned by pst ( norw . 
  police security service ) for having too close relations with what they believe are russian intelligence officers . 
  additionally he wanted to support a russian resolution in osce , which everybody else in the norwegian delegation was against ( * likely also against his own party , as they 're in a government which has joined eu 's sanctions * ) . 
  short story of the rest : he signed the resolution , and while in baku managed to piss off some lithuanian delegates as well . 
  ( [ source : * vg * ] ( http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/frp/pst-advarte-frp-er-paa-stortinget-for-naer-omgang-med-russlands-ambassade/a/23466955/ ) ) with this and some smaller stories ( [ he refused to live in the east end of oslo -- nrk ] ( http://www.nrk.no/ho/_-jeg-er-ingen-bygdetulling-1.11332256 ) ) , he 's become a controversial and/or ridiculed mp over the last few years . 
  also interesting to mention that the police now carries guns , which they 're been allowed since august last year because of `` risen terror threats '' . 
  this is special permission , as the police normally do not carry guns . 
  the debate now goes whether they should be allowed to carry it at all times , and if this special permission is a plot by the government to `` sneak implement '' ( ? , better translation of * snikinnf\u00f8re * ) this -- both of the coalition partners are pro armed police . 
  i have really have no issue with the danish on it . 
  even if you have so trouble with it , you might adapt pretty quickly . 
  they of course see it from a danish perspective , but i honestly feel it 's only because they sometimes interview danish politicians or danish meps ( or commissioner ) . 
  most episodes are reports from news in europe . 
  though during the summer they 're doing interviews with danes in brussels , which might be more danish oriented , but i do n't think the show suffers from this in general . 
  i have n't heard the one you mention , so ca n't answer for the likeness . 
  i listen to politico ( europe ) . 
  the news site/paper is focused around brussels , and so is the podcast . 
  they do a weekly `` in the loop '' talking about what 's happened in brussels , sometimes more close on the people ( meps , etc. ), 
  than regular news do . 
  in english . 
  additionally they ( irregularly ) do episodes in other european languages ( iirc polish , italian , spanish , german and french so far ) . 
  i really like that -- even though i only speak of them . 
  i also listen to danish radio show * europa lige nu * on podcast , which is more about news all around the continent , but also eu . 
  not in english , though . 
  also we 're happy because we are a small country which does n't have say in big matters anyway -- and would n't expect so inside the eu -- both of which i ca n't see the uk agreeing to . 
  ( can you see them be happy with no influence if they get what they `` want out of europe '' ? ), 
  i 'm a bit surprised about the wind ( though it 's not surprising due to the location ) . 
  but it 's fantastic during the hotter hours to have some cooling wind . 
  yes , i do , actually . 
  i got it from spanish i think , but i do n't remember why or how i chose it . 
  probably i just liked the sound of it . 
  oh yes !, 
  it 's perfect -- or , actually it 's a bit to hot in the middle of the day for my taste . 
  but i was pointing out the weirdness of it , not complaining  i 'm going to algarve soon , though . 
  hope i 've adapted well enough so it wo n't be so big of a difference . 
  and here i am in lisbon with 25 -- 30 degrees . 
  source in spanish ? 
  i 'd be more interested in the most popular character * in * ( and from ) each country . 
  this is obviously not picked by their own people . 
  is this meant to criticise some ( clich\u00e9 ) type of european `` super-state '' ? 
  what 's your preferable alternative to a united/co-operating europe ? 
  uhm , if the eu/europe split up , we would probably be even more influenced by and reliant on the us ( capitalism ) system . 
  i was gon na say that sounds like arne torp . 
  yup . 
  i think comparing them is problematic . 
  the explanation for their rise ( tl ; dr globalisation ) might be the same , but they are pretty different parties with different origins . 
  siv jensen 's biggest hero is margaret thatcher . 
  yes , the parties share anti-immigration sentiment , but i think it 's too easy to `` blame '' immigration alone . 
  they gain because of the same structural changes that happen all over europe . 
  globalisation , herein loss of traditional industry , outsourcing , shift towards service jobs , and feeling neglected by labour/social democratic parties . 
  immigration is a part of it , but not the only reason . 
  you could also point to parties all over europe , not just the nordic ones . 
  though the four parties might operate in the same overarching structural environment , their origin is different ( i do n't know much about the finns , and know frp best , naturally ) . 
  i 'll ramble a bit : progress party ( frp ) started as a liberalist movement . 
  they were literally called `` anders lange 's party for a strong reduction in taxes , duties and public intervention '' . 
  though they are also more populist now , they still have a large amount of liberalist politicians with neoliberal policies , especially on economy . 
  danish people 's party ( df ) are anti-immigration , but the rest of their politics is more like a social democratic party -- they 're heavy on welfare and public spending on such areas . 
  sweden democrats ( sd ) have a more right-wing origin , in fascist milieus which still haunts them , and the other parties still use against them . 
  these origins , our different political `` atmospheres '' ( the other parties wo n't touch sd ) , and their differences all contribute to the different behaviours in parliament and government . 
  frp have wanted to be in government for ages , df seem to avoid it at all costs , and sd probably just wants to be taken seriously by the others . 
  also important to point out that the parties does n't really want to be seen with each other , either . 
  frp and sd do n't really like each other . 
  frp want to align with liberal parties in denmark rather than df .
