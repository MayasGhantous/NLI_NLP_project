  do you think they even get citizenship ? 
  in lebanon , they get a place to place their tents , everything else including the tents is provided by the international community . 
  that 's not even remotely the same as immigration to the west . 
  900 a year , plus their family reunification , plus their children and grandchildren ... add a couple multipliers to it and it adds up . 
  see britain for an example : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/11/muslim-population-england-wales-nearly-doubles-10-years, 
  eu parliamentaries are some of the most bureaucratic face-in-the-sky people out there . 
   seriously , dude ? 
  kosher or halal how is that an issue to anybody ? 
  it 's an issue with sikhs , whom have a prohibition in their religion against eating halal meat . 
  [ eating meat killed in a ritualistic manner ( kutha meat ) : sikhs are strictly prohibited from eating meat killed in a ritualistic manner ( such as halal or kosher , known as kutha meat [ 6 ] ) , or any meat where langar is served . 
  [ 7 ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prohibitions_in_sikhism ), 
   the research we have shows that immigration has had a positive effect on economic growth in europe overall . 
  this remains true in economists ' most sophisticated forecasts for the future . 
  bullshit , lies etc. 
  maybe he lumps european immigration with nonwestern immigration ? 
  that 's a common trick to make it appear profitable . 
  another is to look at `` economic growth '' while ` forgetting ' that the relevant statistic is * economic growth per capita * . 
  but , i 've documented on the past that ( quoting myself here : norway : the central bureau of statistics ( roughly equivalent to the congressional budget office ) calculated that the cost of each non western immigrant was 4,1 million nok during their lifetime ; equal to 665 000 usd . 
  there are variations between the groups , with somalis costing twice that . 
  reference : ssb reports 15/2012 , makro\u00f8konomi og offentlige fi nanser i ulike scenarioer for innvandring ( macro econmics and public finances in different immigration scenarios ) http://www.ssb.no/a/publikasjoner/pdf/rapp_201215/rapp_201215.pdf in denmark they were as in all things ahead of us , making the survey in 2008 . 
  more specifically , the central banks third quarterly report of 2008 , noting that all immigration except for high skilled western ones were a massive loss . 
  in 2005 this loss per immigrant was estimated to be negative 2,6 million dk , equal to 461 000 usd . 
  mind you , the inflation means the real value today is higher by 20 % if the [ online inflation calculator ] ( http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?a=100&amp;c1=dkk&amp;indice=dkcpi2013&amp;dd1=31&amp;mm1=01&amp;yyyy1=2006&amp;dd2=18&amp;mm2=08&amp;yyyy2=2014&amp;btnok=compute+actual+value ) is to be believed . 
  source : [ report velf\u00e6rdskommmissionen march 2005 ( the welfare commision ) page 26 . 
  well , statistics like this would get you exiled pretty quickly . 
  but we do know that , according to the central bureau of statistics in sweden - statistiska centralbyr\u00e5n or scb - 57 % if `` foreign born '' immigrants age 21-61 work , whereas 87 % is the number for natives . 
  for africans the number is 39/48 for women/men , for asians ( mid easterners realistically ) it 's 46/54 . 
  source : [ statistiska centralbyr\u00e5n integration : rapport 6 ] ( http://www.scb.se/statistik/_publikationer/le0105_2013a01_br_be57br1301.pdf ) so there 's no reason to think the expense is any lesser in sweden than in other countries . 
  i could go on and on and on . 
  the main problem is low labour participation rates , with a secondary problem of little higher education in the second generation . 
  i have yet to see anywhere this does n't hold true . 
  also , mind you , that in norway atm the unemployment rate looks like [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:no&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) and an economy per capita of twice that of germany and france . 
  free school , university , highly subsidized childcare . 
  in other words , ideal conditions . 
  if it does n't work here , how do you think immigration works in countries with 6 + % unemployment ? 
  the fact is , if you * actually care * about helping people , you should advocate spending money in their home countries because god knows how many africans you could save for 500k $ . 
  certainly more than the one you can save through immigration - and it ends up being more than 500k a piece too , once they start bringing their family members in . 
  ---------------- honestly i 'd be surprised if the numbers were n't even worse in the uk . 
  [ some attempts at making calculations have been made ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11209234/immigration-from-outside-europe-cost-120-billion.html ) and they show that immigration cost 120 billion # . 
  of course , it will be much worse once these grow old and their labour participation rate plummets ( further ) . 
  this is another common trick to make immigration look profitable : you count the incomes without adjusting for age . 
  immigrants tend to be younger , and thus get less pensions . 
  of course , this does n't last ... 
  immigrants will eventually age . 
  all of the above calculations are optimistic estimates , as they assume the children of immigrants are integrated 100 % and wo n't incur additional costs . 
  they also do n't take into account that in many cultures second generation immigrants will bring spouses from their old country , thus incurring additional costs . 
  it 's a pity that our collective establishments have tried as hard as they can to deny these facts for decades , but eventually the bubble will burst . 
  it can happen sooner or later , but the later it bursts the worse it 's gon na be . 
  is it still holodomor in ukraine ? 
  i mean i like slim girls , but starving is pushing it . 
  if anything , the voting age should be increased . 
  the brain is n't fully developed at 18 at all . 
  in addition , very few 18 year olds have tried living on their own , seeking a job , trying themselves at life without some sort of imposed structure ... used to be voting age here was 21 . 
  that was a good age . 
  should n't be any lower , though i may be convinced it ought to be higher . 
  the brain is fully developed at 25 , which would make a more natural cut-off point . 
  used to be that lefties worried about the race to the bottom due to globalization . 
  i 'm not old , but i remember that was a talking point . 
  today they are more likely to support just that . 
  what kind of immigrants do you have ? 
  mostly east asians right ? 
  east asians perform ok in europe as well . 
  it 's the africans and middle easterners ( + pakistan ) whom perform abysmally . 
   what 's to stop them being deported back to stable african countries through legitimate channels ? 
  unless they qualify as refugees under international law afaik they are illegal migrants and can be deported asap . 
  because it is very hard to check whether they are refugees or illegal immigrants . 
  and they are trying as hard as they possibly can to create a good cover story , and the rumour mill is extremely efficient among refugees ... 
  the idea that legitimate channels would `` fix '' immigration is retarded . 
  the amount of people who wants to go to europe so far outweighs the amount of people who can reasonably come ( and as africa is doubled in population in 2050 , it 's even worse ) , legal immigration wo n't do much to stop smuggling ... and of course it does n't change the underlying problem , which is that nonwestern immigration to europe is costly and antisocial , and is at unsustainable levels already . 
  and of course there is a second factor : legal immigration would presumably pick the best , based on some kind of criteria ... and the boat people are likely the last people in the world to qualify . 
  in se asia , there are many people whom are desperately poor , but who have better education than what is common in africa . 
  lastly , they will compete against the entire world including the ones not in africa , so unless we discriminate against non-africans in our selection ( as well as africans from regions whom are locked out of smuggling routes to europe ) , most of the people coming wo n't even be from the areas currently sending boat people ... really , it 's a non-solution and if anyone pretends to believe it they are either a fool , or playing you for one . 
   the solution to illegal immigration is regulation and stabilization of the source countries . 
  people do n't take life endangering trips because they have options . 
  hm , so all we have to do is fix the entire world ? 
  why did no one think of that ? 
   occam 's razor says that i should interpret it as the first that 's ... not really what occams razor says no . 
  occams razor says you should pick the least complex solution , * when both are equally likely * . 
  in this case you actually have the answer right in front of you , so the two different answers are n't equally likely , in fact one is wrong and the other is right . 
  also occams razor is n't really a formal logic principle , more like a rule of thumb . 
  what can i say ? 
  i blame public education . 
  if it makes you feel better , it is just as poor in my country . 
  communism is the final stage of history according to marx ; it is a classless , stateless society with no division of labour . 
  socialism is the second last ; it is one in which the public ( usually interpreted as the state ) control of the means of production , in order to smash the capitalists and the class system , and gradually distribute the means of production to the workers . 
  the soviet union was communist ideologically , in that they believed in communist theory , and that the world history would eventually turn communist . 
  but it was socialist in name and practice , because they believed the socialist stage would have to happen * before * the communist one , and that was the stage they were in . 
  for proof , read either wikipedia or a dictionary . 
  most of them are n't even libyan , they are african and syrian . 
   there is no `` truth '' when it comes to which party british people should vote for . 
  `` which party should you vote for '' is a subject for an op ` ed , which is the genre of this economist article . 
   to pretend that this is a question of truth is dishonest . 
  no , but * journalism * is . 
  imagine you 're reporting on , say , the baltimore riots . 
  is it ok to make up bullshit stories because lel its not about truth ? 
  or lie about an event because hurrr all journalism is biased ? 
  of course not . 
   journalism has never been neutral true  never should try and be neutral this is completely incorrect . 
  good journalism tries to show the truth , not just the truth that supports their narrative . 
  of course you ca n't be 100 % impartial , but it is possible to make an honest attempt ... and that honest attempt is what separates good journalism and trash-tier journalism .
