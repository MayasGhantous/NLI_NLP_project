  and to add to this , the left would oppose such moves with all they got . 
  in short , temporary asylum is not an option anywhere in europe . 
   asylum applications it 's not the asylum applications that 's the problem , it 's the illegals . 
  why the jews ? 
  extremist communities that really have nothing in common - the muslims , the nazis , the afro-centrists ( nation of islam ) - all hate jews for some reason . 
  when they are fighting the entire world , do n't they have more to worry about ? 
  just remember to pay the piper the agreed price . 
  megalomaniac , impossible , insane , are a few adjectives that comes to mind . 
  does ireland have white guilted sjw politicians ? 
  i mean , ireland were not since medieval times times slave traders or colonists , they * were * the slaves and colonies . 
  seems to me that the standard sjw fare should be unconvincing in ireland . 
  or are they repeating sjw shit because it 's what 's hip in england ? 
  i 've always had a soft spot for latvia , they are the birthplace of dr doom after all . 
  we need more supervillains in todays society . 
  we ( russians * and * the west ) need to expand our list analogies ... 
  i hope you did n't soil your tracksuit . 
  amusingly , the lefties used to lionize the working class . 
  the working class were the good people and the nazis and authoritarians were the rest , they said , with the middle class being nothing but hitler enablers and sleeping fascists . 
  then when it seems the working class did n't go along with their ideas they were now the new nazis after all . 
  the world is weird . 
  the idea that the euro needs to be divided in two , one for the poorer and one for the wealthier countries , has been spoken alot around here . 
  in particular among the lefties . 
  i do n't understand why it is now super controversial and evil . 
  what happened was : she visited a rescue boat , they asked if she wanted to try to be rescued , and she said yes . 
  that 's it . 
  and no , that 's not really objectionable in any way . 
  the rest is agenda and spin from her political opponents . 
  it 's a stupid claim to make , but * prosecutors * really should n't involve themselves in academic debates . 
  they are bad for your health in many ways outside of just the calorie intake , and sugar also makes it harder for you to eat responsibly because sugar stimulates the appetite . 
  it 's pretty horrible that you * ca n't * abort below 16 , really . 
  imagine being a 15 year old fucking up and getting pregnant but your insane parents thinks being a parent is good for you somehow , now gg your education and career . 
  [ type it into google ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=48%3a2\\ ( 9 % 2b3 \\ ) & rlz = 1c1asrm_enno601no601 & oq = 48 % 3a2 \\ ( 9 % 2b3 \\ ) & aqs = chrome . .69 i57 .3431 j0j7 & sourceid = chrome & ie = utf-8 ) and get a different result . 
  but as i said , it 's ambiguous . . 
  did you make that post before i edited in an elaboration in my post ? 
   the same goes for his infinite sums vids , but he 's got a master i ' physics not maths so it 's understandable you realize that people with master in physics needs a * preeetty * good understanding of maths right ? 
  not only maths but applied maths . 
   ever read a cook book and go in a rant : put the parenthesis !, 
  how should i know if it 's no , because i 'm not autistic . 
  also the cook book is n't actually an authority on mathematical notation , believe it or not . 
   the question is valid and has a simple answer . 
  it 's people who do n't understand how indo-european grammar works that get confused . 
  hahaha , mathematical notation is not actually based on indo european grammar . 
  [ does n't it require some letters in there to be algebraic ? 
  ] ( https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics/core-algebra-expressions ) i see simple arithmetics really . 
  it 's a troll question that is intentionally ambiguous . 
  questions of the type have been around for a couple years . 
  whenever you see such a question , post this youtube video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9h1oqv21vs i suppose i should go more in depth on this since people tend to get really cocksure and quarrelsome about this topic : in college level mathematics , and hopefully high school level if you 're in a mathematical track , people tend to see division as multiplication with a fraction , and as such the division sign \u00f7 is very rarely used . 
  for example 3 \u00f7 2 is 3 * ( 1/2 ) . 
  as a result it 's not very well defined where \u00f7 is in the order of things . 
  if you type the question into different calculators for example , you 'll get different answers . 
  in primary school however you learn some mnemonic to help you remember the order of operations , and since what you learn in childhood = truth forever , most people are very stuck in their ways . 
  it gets worse because most mathematics teaches what we call `` the algorithmic mindset '' , that is , the idea that mathematics is about taking one set of instructions and carrying them out perfectly , and that any deviation is wrong . 
  the truth however , is that mathematical language is like normal language , and that that grammar is more or less arbitrarily chosen . 
  whether 48 \u00f7 2 ( 9 +3 ) is 48 / ( 2x ( 9 +3 ) ) or ( 48/2 ) x ( 9 +3 ) is like the question of whether the word is written `` labor '' or `` labour '' . 
  the questioner must either define his terms - is it uk or american english ? 
  - or accept both answers . 
  you see this concept of mathematical languages very well in programming . 
  you 'll find different programming languages have defined different ways of interpreting numerical inputs , and lots ( most ? ), 
  do n't use pemdas or whatever kiddie mnemnonic you 've learnt , and all of them * work * to some degree or other . 
  the answer to the question is that it 's ambigous , and the person asking the question is either ignorant or a troll . 
   story tellers are the secret legislators of mankind . 
   the scene where luke tosses his lightsaber away rather than using it in righteous wrath to smite the evil emperor may have only been a scene in a kid 's space opera flick : but the majority of the american public regards exactly that same maneuver , preemptive self-disarmament , as the only moral and right thing to do in the face of the appalling evils of our present war , a war they dare not admit exist , lest they feel a split second of anger , and like a lightswitch being flipped , turn entirely evil themselves . 
  that is what they think will happen if we fight back . 
  if you smite a sith , you become a sith . 
  http://www.scifiwright.com/2015/12/the-force-awakens-and-hits-the-snooze-button this is pretty much what happens . 
  there 's a meme going around , seemingly having it 's origins in the bible and star wars , that fighting is per definition useless and unfruitful ; and it was reinforced from one single instance where it had backfire effects in pakistan . 
  people have since generalized that situation and believe some bizarre mix of ghandi , jesus and star wars ideology when it comes to fighting . 
  belgium was a high-trust society just a few decades ago , it makes sense that their security institutions will need some time to adjust to their new low trust reality . 
  do n't judge them too harshly . 
  and do n't worry , they will get plenty of training . 
  so is buying dogfood to your pet when you can rather donate that money to starving children in africa . 
  some level of selfishness is ok . a perfectly altruistic person is pathological and ca n't survive at all . 
   because news outlets would never fiddle with the truth or put some light on situations that benefits their clickbaity headline . 
  the truth is that for over half a year , everyone and that includes the leftists , has believed that merkel invited and wanted this refugee crisis , that she 's their champion , and that refugees coming is a good thing , and that it 's only a crisis because rightard egoists . 
  now that this is shown to be transparently false , suddenly they stick their fingers in their ears , pretends it never happened . 
  the brazenness is unreal . 
  i 'm linking it because i do n't bother typing it out again . 
  but what i write is true . 
  i do n't see how a person who 's been even present during last years news cycle can say otherwise . 
  well it [ is germanys fault ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/d14jirj ), 
  it might be merkel was misinterpreted the first time . 
  however , the second , third , fourth , fifth time from the beginning until now , she has : used every opportunity to make a photoshoot chided every german wanting to restrict the flow , going so far as to make crazy statements about how [ germany is n't really worthy of her if they do n't do as she says ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/merkel-refuses-to-apologize-for-welcoming-refugees-a-1053253.html ) ( and that 's far from the only time ) chided every foreign country that wants an end to the refugee crisis , including threatening poland and the v4 lastly , abstained from making any correction that is considered as such by the media . 
  since then , there are literally dozens of opeds writing about kind hearted merkel taking leadership in europe by accepting every possible refugee and essentially driving this entire thing ... 
  if it was n't true , how come merkel never fucking corrected it and even actively encouraged that thinking ? 
  if it was n't her policy to invite them in the beginning , she definitely did run with it and it definitely is her policy * now * . 
  yes germans you did do this . 
  lend-lease contributed roughly 10 % of the output of russia during the war . 
  a sizeable contribution , but one i think you 're overstating . 
  http://twistedsifter.com/videos/24-hours-of-flights-through-europe-visualized/  on a typical july day there are around 30,000 flights across european airspace sound quite feasible . 
  particularly because the migrants can be flown at times that are outside of the normal times people travel . 
   under stalin , `` order '' and national prestige trumped human rights or civil liberties . 
  understatement of the century ... 
   because we 've still got an open door policy to all eu migrants do you see that as a problem ? 
  the open door , that is ? 
  then you have to concede that closing it to the non-eu people is a significant step up from not having it closed . 
  end of story . 
  might be the eu door should be closed too , but how does that contradict what i said at all ? 
  no that 's not what he said , what he said was  the structural reforms economists often have in mind ( i.e. 
  liberalization and deregulation of markets ) lead to lower wages and prices in the short-term , which does not help inflation normalisation which different from saying `` trickle down economics '' ( a word that is only ever used as a perjorative , and is as such about as accurate as ` god hating commies ' ) does n't work '' . 
  he actually explicitly says that  structural reforms are essential for long-term potential growth what he says is that in this particular scenario , the reforms are n't good .
