* swedish, 
  i 'm talking about iceland and norway , which are very much a part of europe , and geographically so is some parts of turkey . 
  you need to check up on what europe is . 
  that 's like saying `` why is canada on the map of north america , they 're not even part of the us ! '', 
  why should we join the eu ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  why should a gang of corrupt assholes in brussels have power over me ? 
  if you want to keep living a traditional sami life , you should be able to do that . 
  persecution and forced sterilization was also going on up until 1975 as far as i know . 
  if you had read the link i just provided you would have seen that :  norwegianization was the official government policy carried out by the norwegian government against the sami and later the kven people of northern norway to assimilate non-norwegian-speaking native populations into an ethnically and culturally uniform norwegian population . 
  basically the sami were forced into a hostile and unwelcoming society . 
  many of them had to hide the fact that they were sami to even get jobs . 
  the norwegianization of the sami population went on far into to the 20th century . 
  [ 1980 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegianization ) , to be specific . 
  sure , [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sami_people#discrimination_against_the_sami ) . 
  the [ sami people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sami_people ) are n't really a separatist group . 
  they have been badly treated , though . 
  [ preikestolen ] ( http://natgeo.se/files/bonnier-ngm/bp_photo/preikestolen.jpg ) in norway . 
  i 've heard you have to stand in line to get to the top , and there 's garbage everywhere . 
  never been there myself , though . 
  maybe somebody here can confirm/infirm ? 
  yes , all eu citizens are european , but not all europeans are eu citizens . 
  which makes these kinds of headlines and titles weird , because it excludes countries . 
  also , the brains of the eu could very well move and work outside of the eu . 
  a lot of proffesionals work in norway , for example , because of the eec . 
  no idea , you 're the brit . 
  could probably say something like `` where the brains of the eu move '' , but whatever . 
  eu \u2260 europe, 
   r/europe should be a club for people living in nations within the european union . 
  why ? 
  could n't you make an eu-sub instead ? 
  feels weird to be excluded just because we 're not in the eu . 
  what, 
  not even slightly . 
  i ca n't imagine how terrible it would be travelling around the world and everyone understanding everything you say . 
  i love having a `` secret language '' with friends and family when i 'm abroad . 
  this is a good one . 
  but north of the wall there are no surnames . 
  and as you can see [ here ] ( https://www.google.se/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;docid=lbndqo0hgjgcsm&amp;tbnid=1eqe5shbsa4jwm:&amp;ved=0cauqjrw&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2flemill.net%2fcontent%2fpieces%2fsatellite-image-of-finland-in-the-winter-of-2002&amp;ei=h2fcu7z9oswkywom6ohqaq&amp;bvm=bv.65397613,d.zwu&amp;psig=afqjcnegdgnvhjtrybjmqluhbzdaorsbug&amp;ust=1398649497027281 ) , we 're clearly wildlings . 
  quit the stuff a couple of months ago after nine years . 
  first two weeks were hell , but i can finally go a couple of hours without thinking about it . 
  after food is the hardest . 
  not in malm\u00f6 either . 
  i 'll take it !, 
  i really do n't know . 
  i mean . . have you ever won a competition in your life ? 
  how much better does it feel than getting 2nd place ? 
  i 'd rather win once than always getting 2nd place . 
  i do n't know really , but i do think a gold medal is more prestigious than two silver medals . 
  that does n't make sense . 
  how is two silver worth more than a gold medal ? 
  analjunkie is full of shit . 
  obviously he does n't even know that oslo is in norway . 
  and , as it turns out , that whole crime spree he 's talking about was nothing but [ media hype ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/krim/forsker-ingen-ransbolge-7383333.html#.usw9i7qucta ) . 
  the progress party is also a norwegian party , not swedish ( and while i do n't like them , i would never compare them to sd ) . 
  yes , we let a lot of people into scandianvia , and it has its problems , but why the fuck should that stop us from trying to build a better world ? 
  giving a new life to people from war-torn countries ? 
  letting women get an education ? 
  letting children have a chance to have a decent life ? 
  the world is getting smaller and smaller . 
  people of every race and religion are almost everywhere . 
  what are you suggesting ? 
  stopping this globalization ? 
  let people fend for themselves , dying of wars , droughts and famines that us westerners are responsible for ? 
  most people here have no idea what they 're talking about . 
  take it from a guy from oslo living in malm\u00f6 ( the ` worst ' cities in both sweden and norway - immigration wise ) : we 're doing perfectly fine . 
  it 's not our fault the rest of europe ca n't see that . 
  i think it is very ironic that another post on the front page of this sub is talking about nationalism as [ bad thing ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1umgtr/is_the_european_union_just_another_form_of/ ) ( which it is ) , and in this post people blame the swedes for not being nationalistic shut-ins like themselves . 
  i 'd argue that [ avaldsnes ] ( http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/avaldsnes_kongsg%c3%a5rd ) was the first norwegian capital . 
  yeah man ... we 're so lonely . 
  haha , did you really expect anything else ? 
  too lazy to look all the countries up , but it would 've been cool to see which are constitutional monarchies and which are other forms . 
  you mean sept-april , right ? 
  that 's what i was taught in scouts . 
  fire is allowed in every month with an r in its name . 
  i 'd love to do this . 
  norwegian living in sweden here . 
  i 'll try to get you both , as i am going home to the motherland for a weekend pretty soon . 
  edit : how are you going to hide this from her ? 
  i 'm guessing she 'll be quite suspicious if you deny her mailbox-checking privileges for a month . 
  should we put them in a envelope and address it to you ? 
  that means you wont get the stamps and all that . 
  hmm . 
  haha , and thank god for that . 
  europe still . 
  this is a skyrim joke . 
  you guys obviously have n't been to norway . 
  anyone care to explain ? 
  what 's the deal with the t-shirt ? 
  i 'm norwegian and moving to sweden in a week . 
  am i doing it wrong ? 
  yes , of course , how could i forget our eastern ski warriors ? 
  every winter olympics or world ski championships ever . 
  it 's funny , because we know no one other than us ( and the swedes ) care about cross-country skiing , but we still celebrate each win as a world happening . 
  does n't sound very touristy . 
  `` there is no way you will * not * make australia home '' . 
  again . . 
  source ? 
  ah man , you almost got me . 
  yeah , let 's force them to wait with caring about politics until they 're adults .
