  she 's straight up sending him out to die . 
  and gloating over it in public . 
  agreed . 
  you should probably use bing for that kind of searches . 
   `` second kalmar union '' klii it with fire . 
  we 'll wait until both the imperialists have fought each other to exhaustion , then plundrer the remains . 
  i should probably admit that i have no idea what reverse anschluss would be in * actual * german ... 
  know the feeling ... 
  i mean if the eu is willing to compromise on the uk not joining the full schengen in the negotiations , the uk will most likely have to compromise on something else in return . 
  could be money , could be something else . 
   wellington 's olive branch came alongside an offer to discuss a trade agreement with the uk , which would help britain get out of the starting blocks and begin replacing the trade access lost as a result of the brexit vote . 
  so nz is going to negotiate a trade agreement with the uk . 
  meanwhile and completely unrelated , nz offers the uk kiwi trade negotiators . 
  ^ sneaky ^ little ^ hobbitses, 
  i would think that this is one area where the uk could get a deal similar to what it already has with the eu . 
  free movement , but with border controls . 
  but not without giving something back . 
  he should drag his papist terrorist ass back to wroclaw !, 
  of course not . 
  they 'll have to pay more for market access now . 
  and probably more bank bailouts . 
  it was not produced as a response to the crimea crisis . 
  they started with the writing process it before that happened . 
  they may have deliberately chosen an unlikely scenario , to avoid stepping on too many toes and be accused of fear-mongering . 
  but the scenario became even more far-fetched because the world changed while the series was in production . 
  then again , without a russian invasion of crimea , i 'd doubt there being any export marked for the series at all . 
  they 're not ignoring it , looks like they 're just hanging around in other subs and brigading the shit out of the `` new '' queue . 
  what do they mean by `` us leadership '' ? 
  and in what timeframe ? 
  if they 've made it into a running joke , it might be too late to stop them . 
  correct , althougth there are probably many different beliefs within pentecostalism . 
  also , lets never forget `` jesus camp '' is the source for [ raptor jesus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zmtdawnd18 ), 
  try some of these : https://www.nrk.no/emne/barnevernssaka-i-naustdal-1.12773033 http://www.dagbladet.no/tag/barnevern from a christian norwegian newspaper : http://www.vl.no/meninger/kommentar/do-not-use-the-word-persecution-lightly-1.668127 norwegian penecostal publication : http://korsetsseier.no/2016/01/13/lederradet-pinsevenner-forfolges-ikke-av-barnevernet/ norwegian anti-barnevern group : http://www.hra-n.no/ english and norwegian wikipedia , with some sources at the bottom : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barnevernet https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/barnevern_i_norge, 
  the family is [ pentecostal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pentecostalism ) , and there are no laws against religious indoctrination of children in norway . 
  physical correction of children is n't enought to warrant foster care in itself ( unless we 're talking about regular childbeating ) . 
  typically , parents are informed that physical correction is illegal , and typically , they agree to follow the law . 
  but if the parents say that according to their religionus beliefs , it 's ok to use physical correction , and their religious beliefs overrides the law , then their religion can be said to be the indirect cause for foster care . 
  that may or may not be what happened in this case . 
  okay then , one landmark lit up for london . 
  i 'll give you that . 
  but that could only happen because the light sources at brandenburger tor had a union jack template at hand . 
  most monuments in europe do n't have the resources to display colours like that in a spontaneous reaction to an event . 
  it takes planning , time , and even worse : a budget . 
  warzaw stadium could put up polish colours , but evidently not german ones . 
  if there was minutes of silence , and church services in most major cities after london and berlin , then i 'm sorry to say that did n't take place in my city . 
  there probably were candles , though . 
  it matters locally of course . 
  but the absence of light does n't send a message in the same way , because it 's less specific than displaying it the right combination of colours . 
  yeah absolutely . 
  the reason why so many places were able to put the french flag up so fast in so many places was because all they needed was colour filters . 
  just the fact that russia and germany have horizontal colours rather than vertical makes a huge difference , because the light sources are usually on the ground , pointing up on the landmark . 
  which makes for vertical light stripes . 
  nobody lit up any landmarks for london a couple of weeks ago . 
  nobody lit up any landmarks for the victims from the attack on the christmas market in berlin either . 
  sympaties were expressed here on reddit , however and by heads of state in the real world . 
  just the same way it happened yesterday for st. petersburg . 
  solidarity and all that aside , i just do n't know if i 'd trust everyone in turkey to be able to spot the difference between me and other germanic-speakers . 
  it 's not like people over there have n't made mistakes before . 
  i really wan na go sailing in the gulf of freedom this summer . 
  nothing new , thought . 
  in the 1930 's militant nationalists were vocal about other parties being under foreign influence . 
  when the nazis invaded , they lined up to serve the occupiers . 
  thanks , that was what i was thinking about . 
  such a weird thing to discover . 
  was n't there also a thing about hand grenades falling into a weird legal loophole under swedish law ? 
  not good . 
  sounds like the bodyguard should face some sort of legal consequences for that . 
  at the very least be sued for slander or libel . 
  what was the context ? 
  apparently it 's a specific person called petter pilgaard . 
  not at all . 
  he 's simply taken time off his busy schedule to enjoy a traditional skiing trip through the scenic forests of hedemark wearing a traditional wolfskin cloak . 
  the us has a military base on svalbard ? 
  also , mauretania , somalia and indonesia are nowhere near russia . 
  gulf stream and coastal climate helps , as others have said . 
  but yeah , it really is unseasonably warm here right now . 
  nobody * expects * anything , they 're merely stating a public position . 
  reposting / u/tigranater commenting on this map in / r/mapporn a year ago :  i wish those labels would go away on this oft-reposted map . 
  to clarify , those labels have no scientific meaning . 
  they are what the original creator of the map assigned as ethnic labels to haplogroups , but are just plain misleading as haplogroups are haplogroups and nothing else . 
   for example i 've seen this map used to argue `` poland is more aryan than germany '' , which makes no sense as the r1a haplogroup is n't an aryan haplogroup , it 's just the r1a haplogroup . 
  interestingly enough , the r1a haplogroup is found primarily around the proto-indo-european homeland and in india , so in the case of that particular haplogroup there is a definite correspondence between descendants of indo-europeans and the haplogroup . 
   but the case of r1a is the exception not the rule . 
  almost all of europe speaks ie languages yet the haplogroups are so diverse . 
  not quite . 
  we wrote a constituion in between , and declared independence . 
  that constituion meant that we were a lot better off than under denmark , and mostly ruled ourselves . 
  but union with sweden was a step down from full independence , and differences in the interpetetation of norway 's position within the union was never fully resolved , which effectively wrecked the union by the end of the 1800 's ( the consulate crisis ) . 
  i 'm not a fan of erdo-bob and the current turkish regime . 
  but honestly , the actors in the region probably already knew . 
  you ca n't really hide a deployment like that . 
  who would have guessed they 'd concentrate around airfields , for example ? 
  pretty much everyone . 
  you have to wonder if a few hungarians will be slightly confused when the election comes , and they ca n't find soros ' name on the ballot . 
  ~ ~ jet fuel ca n't melt polystyrene foam ! ~ ~, 
  i had to look it up on [ wikipedia ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurodance#norske_eurodance_grupper.2fartister ) , but apparently there were some : [ reset - blue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6onidkoyz5w ) [ trancylvania - tender heart ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4oxzznjnqc ) [ la verdi - vinger ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pipa63kqfa ) [ stella getz - friends ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mu-l6tsbh8 ) [ devotion - makes me feel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrmd1diwypu ), 
  i think those are just the requirements to be accepted into the course . 
  it 's fairly basic stuff . 
  not really any point in having trade talks with the uk until we know what their relationship with the eu will look like post-brexit , or what kind of changes they will make to their laws as a result . 
  looking at wikipedia , there seems to be two new classes of frigates , as well as more corvettes and submarines .
