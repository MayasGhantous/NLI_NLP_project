  started in the world cup in 1988 as a 16 year old and is still going strong now at 44 . 
  lofoten , closely followed by the fjords on the west coast . 
  artificial and commercial as shit . 
  never been to the states , and florida is not among the states i want to visit the most . 
  it 's something only edgy kids care about . 
  because they are so few compared to americans . 
  horse racing on ice ? 
  not enough snow . 
  we 'll take back j\u00e4mtland and h\u00e4rjedalen . 
  all the - y names ( jonny , tommy , ronny , harry , roy etc. ), 
  the knug, 
  the two biggest events that happen annually are the holmenkollen weekend ( cross country skiing and ski jumping ) and the norwegian cup final ( football ) . 
  northern norway was hit hardest . 
  when the soviets came across the border and the germans had to retreat they burned down basically everything , including entire towns . 
  [ our current pm ] ( http://www.mauranger.no/image/pageimage/huge/nyhendefoto_2009/erna01.jpg ), 
  [ harald fairhair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harald_fairhair ) , who united norway to one kingdom and became the first king of norway . 
  the area he ruled over was n't as big as norway is today , though . 
  we also have [ einar gerhardsen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/einar_gerhardsen ) . 
  he is the longest serving pm since parlamentarism and is known as `` father of the nation '' for rebuilding the country after wwii . 
  complaining about various stuff , like the weather . 
  cross country skiing . 
  i think many of them do n't try to integrate and just live in their little expat bubble with other americans . 
  absolutely . 
  you 'll see loads of them on may 17th . 
  yes , we call it `` luftlinje '' here . 
  no official leader , but currently the leader of the labour party , jonas gahr st\u00f8re , is the most prominent opposition leader . 
  2011 terror attacks . 
  [ according to spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det ] ( http://www.sprakradet.no/svardatabase/sporsmal-og-svar/hvor-kommer-kul-og-kult-fra/ ) it has both swedish and english roots . 
  it 's just `` kul '' . 
  i think it comes from `` cool '' . 
  absolutely . 
  with all the mountains , deep valleys and fjords a lot of small villages were quite isolated back in the day and did n't have a lot of contact with other people . 
  that led to very local dialects . 
  nowadays many of these smaller dialects are under pressure as the connections are better and people are moving into the cities . 
  but to use one 's own dialect is widely accepted , perhaps even encouraged , even in more formal settings like national tv , radio and politics . 
  eating liquorice as candy . 
  turns out it 's just normal in certain north european countries . 
  and le tour de france . 
  i 've been using czechia since it became an official name . 
  i meet many germans too , but i have n't noticed that they are more awkward than other foreigners . 
  their english skills tend to be a little weaker , though . 
  i enjoy meeting foreign tourists when i 'm hiking in the norwegian mountains . 
  lunch is for eating . 
  i guess football is growing as a girl sport , but i 'd still say that football is the typical boy sport , while handball is the typical girl sport . 
  we do n't have that major/minor system . 
  but these ten studies had the most applicants this year : 1 . 
  master of science in business administration ( literal translation is `` civil economics '' ) , nhh , bergen 3 . 
  law , uib , bergen 4 . 
  no , i want the commentators to be as neutral as possible . 
  it 's growing , but not significantly . 
  it 's a million miles away from being mainstream . 
  i would n't go to a nfl game . 
  also , we have [ peder \u00c5s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peder_%c3%85s ) that 's used in law studies . 
  that 's not a typo . 
  maybe you 're confused since kari is a female name in finland ? 
  i do n't drive in stop-and-go traffic often since i usually bike to work , but when i do , i actually like playing with the gas , brake and clutch to try to keep a steady roll going and never have to completely stop ( except in intersections ofc ) . 
  how can a road be more adapted to one kind of gearbox ? 
  i get that automatic is preferable if you drive in a lot of slow-moving/start-and-stop traffic , but that 's not about the roads themselves . 
  i 've never seen it at bars/pubs/clubs , but some stores sell budweiser . 
  same + some microwave popcorn now and then . 
  cool . 
  you can make your own beer and wine in norway , but not hard liquor . 
  allemannsretten ( right to roam ) . 
  hiking , tenting etc. 
  are important hobbies to me , so i really appreciate that right . 
  it would be such a hassle if i had to check if i legally can hike and tent where i want to go . 
  [ that time when a truck with 27 tons of brown cheese caught fire in a tunnel and it burned for five days ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21141244 ) and [ the norwegian butter crisis of 2011 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_butter_crisis ) . 
  never forget . 
  my grandmother lived through the occupation of norway . 
  she did n't talk much about the war or what she thought about germany or germans back then or since , but i remember that she did n't like the sound of the german language . 
  she said it sounded so sharp and evil . 
  when i watched telly with her and there was someone speaking german on the news for instance , she would often comment on that . 
  hard liquor too ? 
  in norway stores ca n't be open on public holidays ( including sundays ) . 
  as always there are some exceptions . 
  some make sense ( like gas stations ) , but for some reason there is also an exception for stores that mainly sell flowers , plants and other gardening stuff . 
  so now during easter there are many days where you wo n't find an open store to shop groceries * , but you can go to a garden centre to buy some seeds and a lawnmower . 
  \\* there are some exceptions . 
  small grocery stores ( 150 m2 limit ) and grocery stores in typical tourist places can keep open . 
  never seen one or heard about it . 
  from the image i ca n't even tell what it 's used for . 
  after they are resentenced ? 
  sorry , i 'm not sure , mate . 
  would n't surprise me though , i do n't think we have that many high security prisons , where i guess most of those inmates are . 
  if they ca n't be rehabilitated they get resentenced ( `` forvaring '' ) . 
  i want our prisons to be places for rehabilitation , not revenge and a place that bring the inmates further into the criminal world . 
  also , the newest and most modern prison , halden prison , has got a lot of attention in international media , but that prison has higher standard than other prisons since it 's newer . 
  it would be weird if they built it in an old-fashioned way . 
  i do n't have a problem with certain nationalities , but many tourists that come to norway to experience the nature are not prepared , neither physically or equipment-wise . 
  a hike like trolltunga is 8 hours ( not including breaks ) back and forth for someone in decent hiking shape , but many tourists will use 10-12 hours . 
  when you hike in the norwegian mountains you should always be prepared for all kinds of weather since it can change really quick . 
  many tourists show up in shorts and t-shirt if the weather is nice at the starting point in the morning , with no extra clothes in their backpack . 
  the inbetweeners too , 
  old people want comedians like leif juster back . 
  i 'm not german , but i know that pretty much all bundesliga clubs and players on the national team are from the brd part of the country . 
  yes , for shorter distances . 
  not if you go from the city centre to the edge of the city for instance . 
  strawberry and raspberry . 
  no , but i usually say `` bye ! '', 
  as i leave the bus .
