  that 's a lot of work if op likes hundreds of bands . 
  i thought it was zlatan ? 
  in fact , someone posted some `` zlatan facts '' the other day in / r/soccer , which inspired me to make this post . 
  zlatan seems like the perfect guy for such `` facts '' . 
  edit : i 've seen a lot of those knugen memes since i visit / r/sweden pretty much daily . 
  they are quite funny !, 
  back in the days too or just recently ? 
  in norway it 's [ lars monsen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lars_monsen ) , an adventurer known for long and tough solo expeditions ( the longest was over 2.5 years in canada ) . 
  he films these expeditions and many of them have been shown on the biggest tv channel in norway , so basically everyone knows who he is . 
  einar gerhardsen , the prime minister for most of the 1945-65 period , a time where the modern norwegian welfare state came into existence . 
  he 's called landsfaderen ( `` the father of the country '' ) . 
  i 've heard norwegian sounds like singing . 
  i 've also heard some swedes say that norwegian sounds funny at that you ca n't sound angry in norwegian . 
  no dining table or chairs for guests ? 
  polar bears . 
  you can be a tourist in your own country too . 
  at least we use the word that way in norway . 
  not very common . 
  i live in the eastern part of norway . 
  it 's quite flat here and just forests and fields , so foreign tourists do n't spend much time here . 
  the few tourists that go here are mostly norwegians . 
  yes , some nescafe stuff from a jar . 
  i boil the water in a water boiler . 
  i make a cup of instant coffee since i 'm a poor student . 
  lol , i do n't know . 
  just for fun in this skit , i guess . 
  the two guys shooting are actually real biathletes and among the best in the world , while the dude driving is just a reporter/comedian . 
  [ relevant video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nya6gsrdb1c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m53s ) ( with english subs ), 
  a mercedes benz sprinter . 
   fun fact about him : he said to an austrian newspaper that he is more known in austria than in norway . 
  i guess that could be true . 
  he 's not even the most famous alpine skier in norway , that 's lund svindal . 
  he was n't as dominant as fourcade is now , but he was one of the best in the early 2000s . 
  he was also married to one of the best female norwegian biathletes of all time , so he 's quite famous here . 
  was rapha\u00ebl poir\u00e9e big in france in his heyday ? 
   however i 'm under the impression it 's mostly the older generations who watch and do it . 
  that 's the impression i get too when i see pictures of the crowds at the arenas . 
  i see . 
  congrats on the slalom gold today by the way . 
  too bad kristoffersen could n't really put up a fight today , it 's one of my favourite duels in any sport at the moment . 
  rastorgujevs had a badass start at the relay yesterday !, 
  you guys have a pretty strong team , though . 
  too bad they are n't more recognized at home . 
  is alpine skiing way bigger than ski jumping too ? 
  you guys dominated that sport for a long period . 
  thanks !, 
  and congratulations on the relay victory !, 
  yes , this championship was a bit of a downer for norway . 
  and `` det er det det er . '', 
  are proper sentences/phrases in norwegian and they are quite usual too . 
  they translate to `` is that what it is ? '', 
  and `` that is what it is . '' . 
  so in these cases `` det '' is used for both `` that '' , `` what '' and `` it '' . 
  not in the shadow . 
  the highest i 've experienced is probably 32-33 degrees c. 18-22 degrees c is my ideal summer temperature . 
  warm enough for shorts and t-shirt but not so hot that you do n't have energy to do anything . 
  the newspaper aftenposten . 
  amerika is also much used . 
  bergen and troms\u00f8 . 
  we do n't get ads that are just about guns , but at least one big sport/outdoors chain has guns and other hunting equipment in their ads from time to time . 
  [ \u00d8yafestivalen ] ( http://oyafestivalen.no/en/ ) in oslo . 
  and norwegian . 
  yes , another redditor just suggested another book in the `` concise histories '' series . 
  thanks !, 
  turns out there is an `` concise history of [ country ] '' series of books . 
  that 's helpful !, 
  thanks . 
  but are there any better books in danish ? 
  i have no problem reading danish . 
  is n't that pretty american-centric ? 
  how do you fit that in your garage ? 
  i 've never heard that . 
  must be a regional thing . 
  i know a-ha is big abroad , but the indivdual members ? 
  did you write hattestad separately since he 's in a relationship with visnar ? 
  lol , is n't she just reddit famous ? 
  is he big abroad ? 
  he 's not very famous here . 
  it 's some bullshit . 
  but i think scientology is quite small in norway . 
  whenever i hear about it in the media it 's scientology news from the states . 
  i can only think of one famous scientologist : hans-erik dyvik husby , aka hank von helvete , former singer in turbonegro . 
  living : martin \u00d8degaard , kygo , magnus carlsen or ole gunnar solskj\u00e6r dead : henrik ibsen , edvard grieg or edvard munch, 
  i do . 
  and he still does many danish movies even though he 's been part of some big hollywood movies . 
  jan oblak and anze kopitar . 
  lech walesa , carpenters and other tradesmen that come here to work , beer , holocaust . 
  tesla in norway . 
  i do n't know what cheese you usually eat , but for the most popular cheeses in norway ( yellow cheese like norvegia and jarlsberg and brown cheese ) a cheese slicer is much easier to use and you get more even slices . 
  the cheese slicer . 
  i 've never tried automatic transmission and i do n't really want to . 
  we have swedes for that . 
  are n't dark tranquillity swedish ? 
  the music itself is too extreme for most people , so it 's not part of the mainstream music scene in that sense . 
  i doubt people without any particular interest in music have heard about even the big bands like mayhem and immortal . 
  but it 's not feared and totally underground music like in the 90s with the church burnings and murders . 
  for instance [ dimmu borgir had a concert with kork ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjxprd70vua ) ( the official orchestra of the norwegian broadcasting corporation ) in one of the biggest indoor concert arenas in the country and it was broadcasted on the biggest channel in norway . 
  [ satyricon did a concert in the oslo opera house ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwu22xcdij4 ) with the opea choir . 
  when i think about it , dimmu borgir and satyricon have had some commercial success in norway in the 2000s , so they have more well-known names than other bands .
