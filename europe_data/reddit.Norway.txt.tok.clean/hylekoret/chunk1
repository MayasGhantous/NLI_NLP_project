i could n't find the stats , but if i remember correctly norway has topped it since about 2000 with the exception of 2007-2009 ( i think ) where iceland topped the hdi . 
  weirdly enough after their economy was destroyed by the financial crisis . 
  norway has a pretty decent `` lead '' . 
  0,010 over second place which is pretty much in the hdi . 
  # 2 is tied between australia and switzerland and downwards it 's pretty little that separates countries . 
  huh , i thought for sure finland was among the top 5 . 
  i think sweden is pretty low in nordic standards . 
   and ground into ~ ~ burgers ~ ~ ikea meatballs ftfy, 
  a picture recently went viral in norway where a guy wrote it with the `` f '' and `` j '' close to each other and it looked like adolf . 
  many people believe that 's why he chose that name . 
  norway a landmark shaped like a penis called `` trollpikken '' = troll dick broke thanks to some unknown vandalizers . 
  the press have been having the greatest time of their life with non-stop wordplay and naughty jokes like `` local community pledges to maked the dick rise again '' . 
  this marks the beginning of `` cucumber-season '' in the news . 
  [ troll dick ] ( https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/pressen-har-ordspill-fest-etter-odeleggelsen-av-trollpikken-623924b.html ) the troll dick has pretty much dominated the news this week but other than that someone have been setting cars on fire in oslo , he eventually got caught . 
  this have been used as right-wing rhetoric by the right wing party frp = the progress party , a picture of a burned car along with the text `` do we really want this in norway ? '', 
  has set the tone for their campaign . 
  [ car fire ] ( http://www.vg.no/nyheter/meninger/frp/den-brennende-bilen/a/24081565/ ) other than this it has been mostly foreign news and different angles on the troll dick . 
  well it 's a party where the members choose the policies , not st\u00f8re . 
  he can feel however he wants but he has to represent what the majority votes for . 
  and they recently had * landsm\u00f8te * and i bet it 's after this the new , harder view on immigration was adopted . 
  i forgot the `` the '' in english , which is not my own language . 
  whoops , forgot that, 
  yup , byen is norwegian for the city so it 's actually the longyearcity . 
  not that the year is any longer there . 
  it 's for some reason named after an american that had longyear as his last name and we just slapped `` byen '' on the end . 
  should 've included longyearbyen , wonder if any city can match that latitude . 
  there are tricks to get in front of the line in every city though so it 's not really a problem for me and other people who know this . 
  but if you studied in ntnu i guess it 's a special case because it 's a huge university compared to other universities in norway . 
  and i would guess it 's ntnu you have read about in \u00c5lesund too as they have their main campuses in \u00c5lesund and trondheim . 
  stipend in norway is more than enough to cover apartements rented out by studentsamskipnaden though . 
  and recently the government ruled to increase it significantly to make it cover 11 months instead of 10 . 
  it 's not about winning , it 's about beating the swedes . 
  never heard of that brand before , ca n't recall seeing them either after googling them . 
  i just googled `` fun facts norway '' and this showed up as one of them . 
  wiki also lists us as second . 
  i 'm only quoting . 
  j\u00e6ren and bergen . 
  oslo , ca n't stand the dialect . 
  i had never heard it either . 
  but it makes sense , the cia list is from 2008 and in 2011 kartverket ( the organisation responsible for map data in norway ) updated the norwegian map by making it more detailed . 
  adding 240 000 islands and more details in the fjords , making the coastline 103 000 km . 
  at the narrowest norway is only 1,6 km across and at the widest 431 km across . 
  also we have the worlds second longest coastline .

  in my experience the royal castle has great customer service , you could probably give them a call or send a mail and you would get a fancy royal letter . 
  as for the prime minister , she is n't exactly hard to get . 
  i 'm noone special ^ ^ ^ :( and i have met her three times . 
  theres probably loads of autographs from her online at low prices , or you could just email her or the office and ask nicely . 
  none , i 've always thought of europe as either west or east - as we are taught in school . 
  it was n't until i joined reddit i was told otherwise . 
  well that probably explains it . 
  a municipality that big closing the roads due to snow would be unheard of . 
  huh , it 's fairly common the places i have lived . 
  where i grew up we often had no choice as the plow trucks could n't handle all the new snow . 
  the parking lots was often filled with * sparker * and * pulker * . 
  last year someone even made ski tracks all the way to the university i go to . 
  if you 're finished in high school you either start your university degree and if you do the government will provide you with cheap housing . 
  if not then you probably went vocational school and already have a stable job with a solid income by the age of 20 . 
  tbf plenty of people ski to work/school in norway . 
   is it usual to approach on the street/cafes/shops other public places during day ? 
   does the complicated `` dating rules '' that we have in america exists ? 
  i do n't know what dating rules you have in usa . 
   how common it is for even go to formal dates , or do people just jump to relationships ? 
  it 's not like we meet and are instantly a couple . 
  we date in europe too . 
   what kind of game your country 's women respond to ? 
  what ? 
  no games , approach , mingle , get number and plan a date when you 're sober . 
   is it easy to approach girls in your country ? 
  if you have problems approaching women it 's probably you and not the country that is the problem . 
  so just as hard/easy as anywhere else . 
  norway as capital and knugen in oslo . 
  basically the northeners love russians and russians love northeners . 
  norway ? 
  is that the capital of sweden ? 
  would 've been a great joke if he was n't dead serious . 
   are there a lot of places to see live music ? 
  three that i know of in my city , probably more . 
   what kind of music are they playing ? 
  metal/rock , jazz and trending acts . 
   how often do you personally go to see live music ? 
  at least once a week . 
  nearly all the scandinavians + h2ppyme , raicopk , idkfa_cz , springinberlin , 19dja ... 02 , and non-rhetoric off the top of my head . 
  i often only look at the flair though so the one with the nk flair is just nk-guy in my head . 
  i have problems spelling all the weird names so i 'll just give it my best shot without regard for numbers etc.

  i can name a few others , but these are the ones i would also consider regulars . 
  also i recognize far more than i can name .

  all new houses for both rich , poor and middle class are in this style so yes they come in all prices . 
  it 's complicated , we have very few and the few we have does n't really last long . 
  the highway in my region takes about 30 minutes from start to finish .
