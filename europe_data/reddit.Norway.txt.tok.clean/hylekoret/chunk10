   the un claims there 's too much racism in norway , but according to you racism does n't exist ? 
  i read the link you sent on this , the report they reffered to and the source of that ( sketchy ) newspaper and it 's pretty clear that it have been taken out of context . 
  the committee on the elimination of racial discrimination never criticized norway , they asked critical questions on how racism is being handled relative to how they want racism to be handled and all they concluded was that they want statistics so it can be measurable , which it at the moment is n't in norway . 
   i am just interested in how or why you drew those conclusions . 
  are you a minority speaking from personal experiences ? 
  yes , i am a minority . 
  i was born and raised in norway and have never been thought of as any less of a norwegian than any other norwegian i 've ever met . 
  this would n't have happened if i was exposed to a stereotypical way of acting for my `` race '' , or if my friends knew any stereotypical way we should be different . 
  people who do experience discrimination are people that resent the norwegian culture and keeps holding onto their own , and i both understand the hatred towards them and them wanting to keep their original nations culture as part of their individuality . 
  but they are not races , they are groups of people like roma or muslims . 
  a muslim is n't black , white or yellow . 
  a muslim worships allah . 
  a gypsy is n't black , white or yellow either , he is part of a traveling family with roots somewhere in northern india . 
  this is why i said we do n't have racism , because hatred in norway is towards people of different cultures = discrimination . 
  this i believe goes for most of europe . 
   because multiple sources dispute what you wrote . 
  if you 're sources is that paper you linked me , i read their sources again and they are loosely based on articles made by real news . 
  the local is more like a propaganda media outlet than a serious newspaper . 
  you might want to check out www.aftenposten.no or www.vg.no if you want real insight in what 's going on here . 
  those two are reliable and big newspapers in norway . 
  i think both have english versions , if not then in my experience that google translate button works like 80 % so you would understand most of it . 
  well clearly you did n't read everything i wrote . 
  i 'm leaving it at this , i will only repeat myself if i continue . 
  if youre really that interested read again . 
  we have an incredibly talented rap duo that lately has gone political and released a ridicolously amazing album last year . 
  i could n't find a video with english text but for any scandinavians interested : [ karpe diem - lett \u00e5 v\u00e6re rebell i kjellerleiligheten din ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f1e7qnm_sc ) is probably their most political song and is very relevant to the political climate in norway now . 
  scandinavia has no cultural difference and is basically the same language , we should just merge already into [ kalmar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalmar_union ) 2.0 . 
  i have no idea why hanne is famous and tone damli is famous for participating in idol . 
  it would be mentioned , but it would n't trend on twitter . 
  it would n't turn into a movement like the black lives matter stuff . 
  it would probably be mentioned , forgotten and then hardly repeated ever again . 
  when you keep making every little case into a huge deal it 's not exactly easy to put it behind you and move forward when it turns into the battlecry of an entire ethnicity . 
  that 's what this enormous public backlash does to a cause . 
  statistically we have had enormous immigration since the end of ww2 and during the decolonization , it goes hand in hand with racial differences and i do n't see how that has anything to do with your point of view on this matter ? 
  because we have an increased number of hate crimes therefore we are downsizing ? 
  let 's say we have gone from 1 to 5 in number of hate crimes in two years . 
  us would still sit stable at 30 . 
  show me statistics of actual hate crimes happening relative to population and then us vs eu . 
  let 's see how big of a matter it really is then and who is downsizing/upsizing . 
  racial issues exist in europe too , but in a different way . 
  first of all you should n't compare europe to usa because usa is a country and europe is somewhere between 44 and 60 countries , depending on who you ask . 
  each country with their own history , culture and attitude towards immigrants and races etc. 
  each country has handled it differently . 
  while we in norway might not experience racism at all , but it could still be a problem in lithuania ( example ) . 
  in norway we do n't have a history with slavery , colonies etc. 
  but we have an awful history with jews and are kind of going through a roma-phase now . 
  but they arent races , it 's more culturally/socially differences and that is the cause for hatred in europe , not race . 
  so i would argue racism does n't really exist , but discrimination definitely exist . 
  and yes , i think to have such a huge dialogue on racism is a bad thing . 
  when a man is `` hanged '' for saying nigger on tv , a man who has stood up for equality for a decade at least , it says something about how sensitive this issue is for you . 
  how obsessive the american people is on racial matters ca n't be healthy for a country , how can you `` bury the hatchet '' when it 's still in use ? 
  just look at you , probably american and in here asking questions about racism that would n't struck an europeans mind in a thousand years because this angle on racism does n't exist in among the majority of modern western countries except for usa . 
  i think it 's very unhealthy to be so obsessed about anything race-related , it leads to further separation and only keep reminding people of different color that they in fact are a different color and belong to a given category of stereotypes that the usa exports in huge amounts to europe through social media . 
  this black people love watermelon , chicken etc did n't exist at all 10 years ago in norway , probably europe . 
  now my cousin at 7 years is aware there is a stereotypical separation between black people and white people . 
  stuff my generation did n't know about until vine came along . 
  if your media would just shut up on these matters it would seize to exist . 
  when the whole of usa goes off because bill maher said nigger it makes the whole country seem obsessed about it . 
  and if this is first page news in usa then it 's easy to perceive usa as `` insecure '' about racial matters because of these types of overcorrections . 
  i would say this is why a guy like you might be thinking we downsize , because in us culture ( media in particular ) you upsize and overcorrect , at least from my perspective . 
  it 's hard to stay unbiased , we are taught from the allied point of view on ww2 . 
  no , they discuss the japanese empires imperialism and the genocide on the chinese people . 
  i do n't even think we are taught at all about the pacific theatre . 
  typical adolf . . 
  norway at least , i do n't know about denmark but i would assume they too . 
  i asked why too when i heard and this is the answer i got in [ that other thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6eurmw/in_theoretical_federalized_europe_how_would_you/did6f3m/ ) :  even simple things like death penalty . 
  and mandatory paid time leave . 
  maternity leave . 
  unemployment benefits . 
  really , really simple things . 
  i recently learned on this subreddit that the eu has certain demands that not even usa meets and that 's why they wo n't be able to join . 
  i doubt russia are any better . 
  same that happens if you google `` norway nature '' , judging from google image search we 're nothing but fjords and lofoten . 
  in reality i would say a majority of norways nature looks like that sm\u00e5land-landscape in sweden . 
  if you scroll through the poland results it will eventually show places looking like sm\u00e5land , same with norway . 
  thx , that picture crashed my browser when i tried zooming in ... 
  i would say your equivalant of this might be larger but most european countries has this type of countryside . 
  i 'm impressed , it looks exactly like where i live and i love it here and live here because of that look . 
  i 'm just pointing out that it 's not that `` special '' and that might be why you got downvoted because people might want to see something unique here . 
  like sarek that other swedes have been posting here . 
  i had no idea you guys had nature as mighty as this , it 's a shame that type of nature is buried by sm\u00e5land-style being called the most beautiful by most swedes on threads like this . 
  i can literally take 20 steps outside and i 'll be standing a place like [ this ] ( http://www.camping.se/imagevaultfiles/id_1542/cf_244/st_edited/gyzhumtusq-lx1naek75.jpg ) . 
  looking out the window right now im looking at a scenery like [ this ] ( https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/grazing-cattle-old-rural-area-th-century-landscape-scenery-sweden-smaland-33281388.jpg ) still when people ask me what 's the most beautiful places in norway i answer [ this ] ( http://www.classicnorway.no/upload_images/b09930f8d75444c9ab164a3fee3495d3.jpg.ashx?width=1200 ) because i know the landscape where i live , and apparantly you too is quite common and most people are not that blown away by it . 
  but by all means , it 's pretty damn beautiful . 
  i agree , we are pretty damn lucky with our nature . 
  holy crap , that 's like 1/5 almost of our population . 
  also i 've actually googled that team before because it caught my attention with that name , and thanks to marshal from himym . 
  pretty cool . 
  i will make sure i give them my american football game virginity as a sign of respect the next time im in usa . 
   no , but my point is , what does `` i support the palestinians ! '', 
  mean then ? 
   who do you actually support if you support the palestinians ? 
  that you support the people who lost most of their country during the first arab-israeli war . 
  that you support the people that lived in the palestine mandate for hundreds of years until the un declared the partition plan in 1947 . 
   and support them in what exactly ? 
  most people who support them , support them in getting the originally deisgnated area that they lost in the first war . 
  many people also support them in getting the entire old palestine mandate territory . 
  if you believe your view from your car on the highway represents the majority of europes nature well that 's just nonsense . 
  write any european country name followed by `` nature '' in google image search and you 'll get thousands of picture showing the same type of nature you linked . 
  scroll through these examples and you 'll se it 's not really a special look : [ poland ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=poland+nature&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjr_oq7z67uahumopokhfm-dgmq_auicigb&amp;biw=1824&amp;bih=1076#imgrc=_ ) [ czech republic ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=poland+nature&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjr_oq7z67uahumopokhfm-dgmq_auicigb&amp;biw=1824&amp;bih=1076#tbm=isch&amp;q=czech+republic+nature ) [ england ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=poland+nature&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjr_oq7z67uahumopokhfm-dgmq_auicigb&amp;biw=1824&amp;bih=1076#tbm=isch&amp;q=england+nature ) any random place that 's not mountainous in norway also looks like that .
