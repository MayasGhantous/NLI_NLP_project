  probably downvoted because it 's not really a `` special '' look , at least half of europe looks like this . 
  no , not anything special . 
  just another singer . 
  viking , which the local ** football ** team is already called . 
  traditionally speaking most parties are pro eu , it 's mainly the people that are against . 
  recently more and more have been dropping it from their programs as it 's not considered relevant due to norways economic position and the people not ever wanting to join . 
  the suicide part is kind of true too , they do n't bother mentioning their stance on eu-membership because it would scare away potential voters . 
  recently the biggest party , [ ap ( labour ) dropped it ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/norge/politikk/ap-dropper-a-sla-fast-at-partiet-er-for-eu-614607b.html ) from their program after being pro-eu for decades due to it not being relevant to the `` current situation '' . 
  center, 
  it 's not a notable date . 
  the day the soviets kicked the nazis out of norway though is marked . 
  ca n't speak for why he believes this , but why we most norwegians believe this is : we have a long history with strong local democracies . 
  initially the main argument against was that it would lead to centralisation in br\u00fcssels . 
  in 1972 we voted against and a famous slogan from the no-side was `` it 's far to oslo , but it 's even further to br\u00fcssels '' . 
  in 1994 when we had a new vote on membership and we had a new big argume n't against , we had now found oil and were filthy rich , membership would n't really benefit us . 
  with the pre-existing argument and now being filthy rich we again voted no . 
  some common arguments against eu-membership : * since 94 we have only been getting richer and richer so economically eu-membership would n't affect us as we already are connected to the inner marked through the `` e\u00d8s '' - agreement ( do n't know what it 's in english ) . 
  * the farming industry would n't survive a membership . 
  * our sea would be a common eu-sea without norwegian control . 
  * eu is a `` rich mens club '' that protects itself behind high tariff barriers against others and poor countries * we would have minimal influence because of our size * we would stand freer outside the eu to pursue a different and independent policy * the democratic deficit in the eu is problematic . 
  for example , the european parliament is the only institution directly elected by the people . 
  however , parliament shares the legislative and granting power with the council of ministers and the council of ministers consists of government members from the eu countries . 
  the members of the council of ministers are therefore only indirectly elected by the people . 
  the same can be said of the eu summit , which also consists of many indirectly elected members . 
  * the eu means greater power and freedom for capital forces [ source ( in norwegian ) ] ( http://ndla.no/nb/node/8362?fag=36 ) is the norwegian digital learning arena - ndla . 
  this is some of the common arguments against in norway . 
  i think most of them would fit iceland too . 
  i think one of the reasons for iceland are fish-related , same reason greenland and the faroe islands got out and one of the many reasons i belive norway never will join . 
  i ca n't imagine that ever changing . 
  norway : introvert/reserved - like any scandinavian in this thread already has explained rich - most people are rich , and the country is among the richest in the world tall , blonde and blue eyes - most men are between 185-200cm and we have plenty of blonde people and blue eyed people . 
  same goes for scandinavia vikings - our ancestors were vikings , like the test of scandinavia socialists - mostly left leaning political history , same goes for scandinavia melodic - only the eastern norwegians speak melodic . . and sweden are n't we sweden ? 
  - no , ffs ... patriotic - compared to our size we speak loud and proud about our nation and flag often the law of jante - another scandinavian one , the law of jante is a huge part of our culture not sure how this will look on pc , writing on my phone . 
  sorry if it 's messy . 
  goes for all of scandinavia, 
  7 days is too long for most cities i would say . 
  you could cut it in half and take the second half in paris though ? 
  so having a part in historic events = connection ? 
  if so i would say only a handful people can claim to feel connection to their nations history . 
  to me it 's how you feel the history leading up to today affects you and how you affect the course to come . 
  as in voting , paying taxes etc , basically existing in any democracy makes you connected to their history . 
  [ surstr\u00d8mming ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqe8iujmlds ), 
  i feel a great connection to our history . 
  i ca n't imagine how one would not feel a connection to their nations history . 
  do n't you feel some way about the paradigme shift that trump is representing ? 
  the aftermath of the financial crisis ? 
  how 9/11 affected your foreign policy ? 
  i bet he would be one of two potential prime ministers if he ran for election in autumn . 
  i find it more unsettling that you do n't have a real representative for the left wing of politics . 
  you guys almost struck gold with sanders ... 
  probably center-right to right i agree , probably the equivalant of h\u00f8yre in most cases ? 
  democrats would be placed at center in norway and are the `` sane '' ones . 
  the republicans , if they were in norway , would be hard right and considered extremists in many cases . 
  that 's generally how they are viewed . 
  new york , rome or barcelona probably, 
  i 'm stereotypically scandinavian looking . 
  yeah , went to disneyworld , gatorland , key west and universal studios . 
  great place , surprised by the weather though . 
  like rainy and thunder for 20 minutes and then blue sky and 40 degrees again . 
  and when it rains it ** pours ** . 
  in my field , student without a job it 's about negative 6000 euros yearly . 
  a good salary in norway is around 120 000 euros yearly and upwards i would say , after taxes . 
  same, 
   the union has some fairly strict entry criteria like what ? 
  if any norwegians emigrate it 's mostly to escape the cold , long and dark winters and get some real summers . 
  most people buy a villa in spain and move when they retire . 
  it 's like our florida . 
  sweden : i admire how many great companies/brands that actually are from sweden . 
  i hate that sweden is the comic sans of countries . 
  finland : i admire their school system and i do n't know enough about finland to pick something i hate . . russia : admire russians for bringing us the best [ entertainment on the internet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ktlbqyxklm ) , i hate the human rights violations etc. 
  if sea borders count iceland : love that they are so close to the original norse language , hate that they are n't a county in norway . 
  denmark : love their design , hate their accent . 
  at least we 're not sweden, 
  we use it alot , it 's mainly a symbol of joy here too . 
  we flag whenever we are marking a special event , mostly good things like end for the war , birthday of the king , birthdays in general , 17 . 
  may - constitution day , christmas etc. 
  if you go for the international verizon thing you might not get much use of it . 
  in my experience mainland europe is pretty far behind technologically . 
  4g is not a given across the countries and you have to be in a city to get signal . 
  if you go for wifi i ca n't imagine an airbnb without wifi in 2017 . 
  and mcdonalds , starbucks etc usually have free wifi . 
  odin , lucas or ola for a boy . 
  abortion if it 's a girl . 
  jk , probably jenny or cecilia . 
  good old german efficiency . 
  i would find it amusing if a foreigner tried norwegian . 
  i would n't assume the reason he continues in bad norwegian is because he thinks i have trouble with english . 
  i would assume he just wants to practice his language skills . 
  that 's atleast what i do whenever i 'm in germany and talk shitty german to people . 
  it 's for my sake and not because i do n't expect people to speak english . 
  they are also great for partying without having to spend that much money . 
  well that 's interesting , i answered all the questions ( not other/no words for this ) and my dialect is either new york , yonkers or honolulu . 
  do they speak `` new york '' in honolulu ? 
  or do they just happen to share those words ? 
   reddit thread literally called `` what is one flaw ** your ** country has ? '' . 
   a ** frenchman ** i 'll admit this triggers me when it 's the basis of our modern culture . 
  the fact that everyone does it etc is basically what norway is about and why the people of norway have been voting mostly socialist , social democratic and even communist parties in the last hundred + years . 
  because groupthinking and non-indivduality is a vital part of he scandinavian mindset . 
  [ example : the law of jante . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante ) when a foreigner comes along and calls this a flaw he might trigger a few norwegians/scandinavians .
