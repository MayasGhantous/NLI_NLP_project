  thrashiest city is drammen . 
  ridiculous, 
  i like our [ current national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suayojmtbyq ) , but i would much rather have [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_wm0mfatk4 ) which i know many norwegians want too , but the main argument against has always been that it 's * too * nationalistic , and it would make immigrants feel uncomfortable . 
  not too many years ago they stopped singing it in music classes across the country and even on the national day march some places it has been avoided because of this . 
  both links have texts in english . 
  in norway you go through two schools before you choose if you either want to pursue a `` vocational path '' or academic . 
  when you take this choice you are in your last year of `` ungdomsskolen '' ( youth school ) and are 15-16 years . 
  if you want to be a mechanic then you apply to `` mechanic school '' and study for two years and then two years of paid internship until you graduate with a `` vocational '' diploma . 
  if you want to pursue academics then you apply for high school after `` ungdomsskolen '' and attend high school for three years , get a diploma and then apply for university . 
  only people with this diploma can attend universities . 
  i believe all of europe has variations of this kind of system . 
   are there some careers , ( i 'm thinking pedagogy in particular ) , that are considered `` vocational '' in your country that are not in the us ? 
  no , pedagogy is a university class . 
  vocational is only work like carpenter , mechanic , electrician , nurse ( a kind of nurse ) , receptionist , security guard etc is vocational . 
  you could probably attend a vocational school and become a teacher assistant though . 
  but if it 's teacher you want to be then you have take a five year masters to be it , in norway . 
   is there less of a stigma about it in your country ? 
  people with several years less school are radically different than people with masters and phds . 
  they both think some way of eachother . 
  this is n't an american thing . 
  this goes for norway too . 
  that would be cool . 
  i do n't think we will though . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://www.tuil.no/images/artikler/bj_rnar_russ_hviler_i_gresset_1148137417.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://dbstatic.no/61592596.jpg?imageid=61592596&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;cropw=100.00&amp;croph=100.00&amp;width=1024&amp;height=576 ), 
  and the faroe islands, 
  theres little written from the actual time 790-1050 , the written history is mainly from a couple hundred years later . 
  like snorres edda etc. 
  now i 'm having trouble defining ancient history , it seems to be the antique period from google translate . 
  but from logic it seems to mean old history . 
  the viking age certainly is ancient history as in old history , but it 's not ancient history as in the antique period . 
  it 's the early middle ages and the oldest written history for any scandinavian country . 
  so it 's the oldest written history we have - the most ancient we have . 
  it 's not ancient or old relative to other countries though . 
  vikings, 
  never seen a full game . 
  but from what i 've seen , no . 
  preaty much this, 
  france , italy or the uk . 
   i have a norwegian mother and a danish father , and speak both languages everyone can speak danish , just gag on a potato and make some sounds . 
  i get free food if i work here , [ right ? 
  how about we take all the colours ^ except ^ yellow ^ because ^ fuck ^ sweden . 
  now it 's perfect . 
  norwegian has butchered vienna for me , it 's called wien and is as unsexy as every other german word . 
  would never go there over paris or rome . 
  btw rome, 
  any motorsport are pretty much nonexistent, 
  religion - like . . culturally yeah , spiritually ? 
  agnostic probably , dunno food - love it all , except for [ smalahove ] ( http://media4.origo.no/-/cache/image/2681997_hc5fe00fd465f73892f67_v1412856715_800x.jpeg ) fashion - i recently learned there is a thing called scandinavian fashion or scandinavian minimalism in both clothing and general design . 
  i guess subconsciously i 've followed that fashion gestures - do n't understand what you mean by that ? 
  if it is physical norms then the ones i can think about is not looking people in the eyes in public , not greeting strangers , [ not sitting next to people on the bus ( those two in the front are clearly tourists ) ] ( http://forskning.no/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/329154_buss-bredde_none.jpg?itok=pbvuu-hw ) etc. 
  then i 'm definitely a norwegian in those terms . 
  if it 's gestures like the italians talking with their hands then no , we do n't do that in norway , and yes that goes for me too . 
  so overall i guess im quite traditional by your definition ? 
  danish, 
  i used to expect everyone to speak english as a second language in the western world , learned the hard way that it 's not the case . 
   i heard that some people will appreciate it if tourists try to speak their languages i rarely meet a tourist who knows any norwegian phrases , when i do i respond in english because my dialect is basically another language than the dialect foreigners learn , but i find it really amusing though and appreciate the effort . 
  most , if not all norwegians know english pretty good or fluently and are happy to get to use it once in a while . 
  so if you 're ever in norway you can talk english to whoever you want without worrying about offending them . 
  when i test my language skills as a tourist in germany ( took german in high school ) it 's often met with enthusiasm , and sometimes they do n't even bother . . 
  but mostly positive reactions . 
  in my experience people from benelux also does n't care if you approach them in english or their native language . 
  the people i have met from the baltics and poland are not as good in english but they do n't really care as long as they are understood , which i think is a healthy relationship with foreign languages . 
  it 's mainly in germany and france in my experience that i have to approach in their language and ask if they speak english before continuing in english . 
  especially in france , the stereotype that they are cold and distant if you do n't make an effort is very true in my experience . 
  i agree with the brit here , if anything the most democratic thing is to let the people control their country . 
  what could be more democratic than removing a representative government and replacing it with the people ? 
  that 's communisms ultimate goal , which unfortunately has n't been achieved * yet * . 
  but it 's still what communism is defined as . 
  keep in mind that communism is more of an umbrella term for different variations of socialist systems . 
  only some of them has revolution as a core belief . 
  like for example trotskyism . 
  other variations of communism can be achieved through democratic elections , like it has in scandinavia where it started out as communism and developed to democratic socialism . 
  not really much good music from norway on an international level in my opinion , i ca n't stand the kygo/alan walker-type of music . 
  the metal in norway is too hard and a-ha have a couple of `` fun '' songs . . 
  but if you 're into hip-hop i think lately we 've had a boom in really great rap in norway ( and norwegian unfortunately ) . 
  karpe diem did a politically charged album last year which still baffles me how relevant and smart the lyrics are . 
  if you understand norwegian i recommend [ karpe diem 's album `` heisann montebello '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ll3_eyzkym&amp;list=pl9xmzveortuuzej8xunj8cs_gvfotyehw ) ( song number one is more of an intro , number two is a normal song with heavy meaning and the rest is top notch rap ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya3h9pkwvze ) you might have heard [ sigrid - do n't kill my vibe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzonqoon9eo ) on the radio , it 's annoyingly catchy and really big at the moment . 
  other than hiphop and the possibly one hit wonder sigrid , [ i think ary might be onto something ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-tkbnakmk8 ) with a couple of great songs already made . 
  mildly triggered by communist being mentioned in the same breath as neo-fascist . . actual extreme opinions is legal and all , but if you were to practice hatred of any sort towards someone you could be fined or jailed for personal attack . 
  example : a hairdresser in norway talked alot of shit about muslims in general and their religion , she refused women with hijab to enter her saloon and nobody cared until a muslim woman entered , got thrown out and took her to court for discrimination . 
  she lost , appealed and lost again , sued some people for calling her a nazi , lost that too . 
  they last you your whole life , they are full of jewelry/silverware . 
  men have a knife of silver and they are all handcrafted . 
  and 5k euro is n't as much to a [ norwegian ] ( http://statisticstimes.com/economy/countries-by-projected-gdp-capita.php ) as it is to most other . 
  keep in mind a beer on a pub in either major city is between 10-30 euros each . 
  and often a bunad is given as a gift on confirmation day from the parents ( christian tradition , dunno if other countries practice this as a tradition ) . 
  but still it 's a pretty steep price even to a norwegian , but it 's kind of worth . 
  yup , more like languages or variations of scnadinavian/northern-germanic . 
  my dialect has as much in common with lets say oslo as it have with faroese , danish or swedish . 
  pretty cool that we still understand each other . 
  firstly i think norway , and all other countries in nato that already is n't - should spend their fair share of 2 % . 
  if there were a `` euto '' instead , i feel that even more of a contribution should be made . 
  usas ridicolous military spending makes up 73 % of nato . 
  if we were to remove them and team up in europe/eu we would have to replace their share so we could `` rival '' them and have a say in global geopolitics etc. 
  yeah , definitely with some k\u00e5lrabi on the side and a good jule\u00f8l . 
  [ bunad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bunad ) is our formal party wear . 
  mainly used on 17 . 
  may , two days ago ( still hungover ) . 
  our constitution day .
