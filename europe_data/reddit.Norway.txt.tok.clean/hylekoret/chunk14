  most are pretty awesome and super expensive , they usually cost around 50 thousand nok which is 5 300 euros ca . 
  i love some of them , others are just ugly . 
  there are several bunads for different regions , in my opinion the [ telemarksbunad ] ( http://bunaderoslo.no/upload/iblock/72a/beltestakk_lilla15.jpg ) is the prettiest one . 
  mens bunads do n't vary as much as womens and usually looks something like [ this ] ( http://akbloggen.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/mannsbunad-rogaland.jpg ) here is some more bunadpictures [ a guy and a woman ] ( http://www.bunadbutikk.no/hurdal%20herre%20og%20dame%20bunad%20scalert.png ) [ another guy and woman ] ( https://www.norskflid.no/fileshare/cache/0_800_false_false_1_85__fileshare_filarkivroot_bunad_telemark_ost-telemark_raudtroyebunad_osttele_rodtroye_hel.jpg ) [ people in bunad on a car doing hallingkast ] ( http://www.vest-telemark.no/var/visitrauland/storage/images/vest-telemark/aktoer/oeyfjell/kva-skjer/hallingkast-under-raudsinutan/200957-4-nor-no/hallingkast-under-raudsinutan_lightbox_image.jpg ) [ jumping bunads ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ee/14/c5/ee14c537b380bc427839a64431731c00.jpg ) [ kids in bunad doing hallingkast ] ( http://www.midtsiden.no/files/files/styles/nodeimage/public/cisv09_2686.jpg?itok=pcsxcjlk ) [ more kids doing hallingkast in bunads ] ( http://www.midtsiden.no/files/files/cisv09_2688.jpg ) [ moar !,

  may march wearing bunad , probably 2016 . 
  btw the guy to the right is the princess ' ex husband ] ( http://blogg.tv2.no/kongebloggen/files/2013/05/sz367a15.jpg ) i could go all day , still super patriotic after 17 . 
  may . 
  get rid of that filthy flair , fooled me too . . 
  pinnekj\u00f8tt , no idea how to translate that . 
  it 's very salty lamb . 
  same as your days , only intelligible . 
  we have like a billion accents thanks to the mountains and fjords so * huge * generalization here . 
  but : * northern-norwegian : swears * alot * * eastern norwegian : ( probably the type of norwegian you guys associate norway with ) pretty melodic and feminine . 
  * western norwegian ( northern-j\u00e6ren ) : rich and loud * western norwegian ( bergen ) : loud and thinks they are special * kind of middle norwegian ( tr\u00f8ndersk ) : weirdest accent in norway , also everyone has a mustache . 
  * southern norwegian : christian * my part of norway ( j\u00e6ren in western norway ) : probably the texas/alabama of norway , only most people are really rich . 
  also the only dialect to have subtitles on norwegian television ... 
  most people work either offshore on platforms or in the oil business onshore if not they are farmers . 
  highest concentration of tractors in norway . 
  [ found this pretty accurate list of stereotypes based on regions if you would like to read more in depth . 
  * note the author is from b\u00e6rum , aka thinks everyone else is `` a bit behind '' or peasants , except for that this list is pretty accurate . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/2f689n/norwegian_regional_stereotypes_2214x2352/ ), 
  holy crap thats a big genre . 
  all i know myself is that many people learning norwegian is learning it because of our metal . 
  the same reason i took german in high school , so i could sing along to rammstein . 
  i wrote a similar post on r/askanamerican a while ago and got blasted for our social culture in europe . 
  in that thread we concluded that americans move alot more than norwegians in their lifetime and have to be extrovert to maintain social relationships in new places . 
  i do n't know about the rest of europe , but this explanation on the small talk/politeness made sense to me . 
   nice city yeah it 's a nice city , really beautiful . 
   cheap depends on where you 're from . 
  as a norwegian everywhere is supercheap compared to norway . 
  but i bought a bottle of really good whisky at about 25 euros which would be 70 + euros in norway , so you can compare that to your home country . 
   party clubs/bars do n't know about party clubs , but lots of great bars . 
  hard to find dark beers though , unfortunately ...  girls only place outside of scandinavia where the majority of women are really beautiful , in my opinion . 
   brothels dunno , i 've seen some shady places with some sexual advertisement outside , probably some sex-service . 
   drugs i do n't do drugs so i have no idea . 
   quicktrip to amsterdam that 's possible , and i would recommend it . 
  really beautiful ciy with a chill vibe and great nightlife . 
   how 's the food ? 
  basic , nothing special . 
  desserts are out of this world though , chocolate capital of the world . 
  and again , the beer is basically only belgian ale/golden ale etc. 
  nothing special . 
  saw a comment saying the traffic is awful , i disagree with that . 
  compard to other major european cities it 's nothing special . 
  in norway too , horse is just another source of meat . 
  it was n't until that [ ikea scandal ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/world/europe/ikea-recalls-its-meatballs-horse-meat-is-detected.html ) i found out horse meat was taboo in other countries . 
  if i were in a country where dog is considered food i would give it a taste , but definitely not something i would pursue . 
  they have the best colors though, 
  blonde , tall , rich , socialists , heavy drinkers , melodic language ( that 's sweden ffs ) , superior at skiing ( true ) . 
  i do n't listen to metal myself , but according to my metalhead friends norway has the best metal ? 
  dunno , but i know about kvelertak and glittertind , i do n't know if glittertind is metal though . 
  i used to call them all england , until an irish guy got triggered and threatened to beat me up whilst giving me a history lesson ... 
  in norway though , we either call them all england or by their separate names , except for wales , most people think of wales as england unless you pay attention to football . 
  uk/gb is n't really used , at all here . 
  most people i know doesnt speak of it like a union , more like if they all were separate states . 
  skottland is scotland , england is england etc. 
  wales is england too unless you watch footbal . 
  i rarely or never hear storbritannia ( gb ) . 
  italian at the moment , after that i really should freshen up my german before i forget it all . . 
  i bet most norwegians know little or nothing about portugal , if they know anything it 's that ronaldo is portugese and it 's not spain . 
  thrown out . 
  a couple of weeks ago a bosnian guy just randomly sprayed pepper spray at the linesman during a football game and he got a fine of about 1500 euros and got deported . 
   traditionally the farm is arranged with the buildings in a square . 
  if it 's a smaller one then just the barn opposite the house . 
  it depends on where in the country it is , some places they are scattered and other places they are in a line . 
  i have n't seen it myself yet , but from what i 've read on imdb and what my friends have told me it seems plausible . 
  all our parties are going green to a more or less degree , the green party itself is growing significantly and many people and parties feel we have enough money and shutting down the oil production would n't really affect us . 
  including myself . 
  my friends in the military that guard the russian border always brings this invasion from russia up as a concern they actual have . . 
  for most jobs : $ 40-60k ** at least . 
  ** i havent decided what my field is going to be after my bachelor , but probably political science and the numbers there are $ 50k . 
  as a country we are anti-eu , but we are far from pro-russia ... 
  they constantly `` spits on us '' by flying in our airspace etc and even simulates attacks on us . 
  i have a couple of friends in the military that regularly has to shut down all electronics due to russian espionage etc. 
  they have a tendency to annex countries , which frankly also scares me a little bit due to our strategic coastline , oil/gas and territory in the arcitc sea . 
  before trump that would n't scare me , but that guy changes opinion on nato like a woman changes clothes ... 
  i would love for putin to just chill the fuck down and let us breathe , then we can talk pro-russia . 
  scandinavia , basically color blind up here . 
  this midsummer of yours , is n't this called st johns day and is completely consumed by christianity ? 
  atleast thats the case in norway , we still have the bonfires though . 
  you 're no better . 
  every time i talk with swedes they do some weird melodic thing while talking , so annoying !, 
  the state tv-channel has a facebook page dedicated to satire , nrk satiriks on facebook . 
  absolutely hilarious animations . 
  i highly recommend checking out the ones that have english texting . 
  no , i ` ts not your fault your system is crap . 
  first to discover america , noone is asking who discovered the territory later known as usa . 
  you wish, 
  how we discovered america before columbus , how columbus rediscovered it , slavery , racism , political system , independence/american revolution etc , and the cold war is all i can recall . 
  it 's pretty much non-existent . 
  i managed to find some numbers and it seems to be between 23 thousand and 41 thousand weekly viewers at the most i could find .

  stein and bj\u00f8rn which means stone and bear . 
  volvo 240 are really popular in the agder counties and j\u00e6ren among the youth . 
  my region , j\u00e6ren . 
  lots of drinking , only dialect with subtitles when it 's spoken on norwegian television . 
  in the heart of the `` bible belt '' and most people have at least a shotgun , including myself . 
  the parking lot in high schools are also full of tractors and we have a potato-festival each year .
