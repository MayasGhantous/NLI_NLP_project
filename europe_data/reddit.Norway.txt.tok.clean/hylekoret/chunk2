   are they in good conditions ? 
  if yes , are there often roadworks to repair them early on ? 
  it 's almost a meme by now that there will always be roadwork on the highway . 
  so yes , good conditions and always someone working on it , either cleaning or construction . 
   do you have to pay to use them ? 
  ( and if yes , in what way ? 
  tolls like in france , or vignette like in switzerland , etc ) kind of , you do n't pay to use the highway specifically . 
  you pay on normal roads as well whenever crossing into a new municipality/region etc. 
  all tolls are automated , either you have a box in the windscreen that get 's scanned somehow or an automated camera that identifies your car license and bills you each month . 
  ( i think this is how it works , i drive an electric car so i do n't have to pay any tolls so i might get this part wrong ) . 
   what is the speed limit on highways in your country ? 
  80 , 90 , 100 and 110 . 
  majority of the highways are 90 . 
  they are automatic . 
  somewhat true maybe , i 'm out drinking every weekend ( student ) and groups of women always join me and my friends in our booth . 
  but we do the same , with enough alcohol in us . 
  so probably a 50/50 split ? 
  the nordics are magical during the winter , snow and cozy-frenzy . 
  christmas markets are easy to find , food is great and we have wine too . 
  history is event -  reaction . 
  for example : pc culture -  trump . 
  1 ) he has done a great job in making politics exciting , which unfortunately is something a democracy in this day and age has to be to engage the youngest . 
  so i bet the next election will have among the highest turnouts ever . 
  other than that it 's to early to tell , but he sure has done a great job stirring the pot so far . 
  2 ) you are the super power , have been for quite a long time now and all of nato looks to usa as their guardian . 
  3 ) i think from kims perspective it 's all propaganda for brainwashing nk , i read somewhere that the more he talks the more domestic problems there probably is inside nk . 
  if that is true then trump is just ignorant for taking the bait . 
  4 ) we do n't care about drug politics and there is little to no movement to get it legalized , real issues eclipse the 420 blaze it campaigners . 
  i do n't think we have much hemp based products , do n't really know . 
  5 ) from my perspective : not a nice place to live , you do n't have your shit together and absolutely not a country to look up to . 
  but lovely nature and people though . 
  6 ) i think it 's ignorant to claim we are alone , it 's nearly mathematically impossible . 
   have they been here before ? 
  i do n't think intelligent life has ever visited as portrayed in hollywood . 
  but i 've read that we might come from single-celled organisms that have travelled on asteroids . 
  if that theory is true then i guess we kind of are visiting aliens ? 
  if so then that answers your second question on point 6 too for me . 
  i do n't believe any other hollywood-like aliens currently co-exists with us here on earth . 
   the first name that does n't end with - sen is berg at 14th place . 
  i never noticed that , and here i 've been making fun of my balkan friends who all have names that end with `` ic '' ... 
  every single new house is a [ funkishus ] ( https://www.google.no/search?biw=1824&amp;bih=1076&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=funkishus&amp;oq=funkishus&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.12...0.0.0.15.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1..64.psy-ab..0.0.0.3cmqamsrqsg ) , old ones are in [ this style ] ( https://iec-hus.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/diana_thumb-768x432.jpg ) . 
  if i swam to the deep part of the local lake [ n\u00f8kken ] ( https://annikenroil.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/ng_kh_b_03202.jpg ) would drag me under and drown me . 
  that scarred me for life , i still get anxious when i ca n't see the bottom while swimming . 
   it 's a thing . 
  when your card expires and a bank sends you new one , you get a contactless one . 
  they might send you a new one , but how many terminals accepts the new contactless card ? 
  here it 's nearly every single one . 
  most places i 've been in europe either have the old terminals or no terminal . 
  as for the coverage . 
  large parts of europe are n't covered , even urban areas outside of cities , highways and the countryside . 
  never been to slovenia though so if you claim otherwise i believe you until proven otherwise . 
  well if you lose your card and someone steals money you can just contact your bank and tell them and you 'll get your money back , no hassle at all . 
  as for the contactless , i have n't exactly been to the baltics ( yet ) but in norway nearly every single terminal accepts contactless and compared to the places i 've been in mainland europe we seem to be pretty far ahead , although several places had them though . 
  we can do everything online in norway too . 
  contactless card payment , mobile pay and card payment in general most other countries seem to be a bit behind on . 
  also 4g everywhere is a thing that 's missing from many mainland european countries . 
  yugoslav wars, 
  the local kebab is unlike every other kebab i 've tasted . 
  if you 're ever in stavanger then do yourself a favor and buy rullekebab or stor norge at happy time . 
  what made norwegians bad ? 
  this one is not to my language but to my dialect ; `` daonakk ( j ) e '' or in bokm\u00e5l : `` d\u00f8nakke '' . 
  directly translates to dead neck . 
  the closest english word for it would probably be slacker . 
  another fun one in my dialect is sjiddstomp ( bokm\u00e5l : skittstump * ( ? 
  ) * ) translates to shitty ass . 
  a pretty broad insult that fits most situations . 
  subtitles , family and kids movies are often dubbed though . 
  i 've been to 20 countries , i liked italy the most because of obvious reasons like food , wine , nature , ruins and history . 
  i enjoyed sweden the least , but that 's not swedens fault , it 's just that i 've only been over the border to buy groceries/alcohol , never been in sweden as a tourist . 
  username checks out . 
  dictatorship , minsk and pro-russia sums up my knowledge . 
  by nautical miles . 
  i think swedish is beautiful , like the french of the nordics . 
  so swedish and french . 
  it 's only a big thing if we do well . 
  * probably *, 
  you 're probably better of looking around the us for a place like that . 
  norway is among the most modern and developed countries in the world . 
  also you should look up some documentaries or read some wikis on scandinavia/nordics or norway , you seem very misinformed . 
  the suvs are often the ones rich people buy , along with range rovers .

  shotguns and rifles for hunting and target practice .

  which next to the vatican passport is the nicest looking passports in my opinion . 
  damn , i skim read for norway . . 
  oslo : [ slottet ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_palace,_oslo ) the top historical stuff to see in the most `` historical '' cities in my opinion . 
  keep in mind that there is a bunch of more stuff to see in each city , especially oslo . 
  bonus , driving from trondheim to bergen to stavanger you will drive by places like [ this ] ( https://t1.daumcdn.net/thumb/r1280x0/?fname=http://t1.daumcdn.net/brunch/service/user/spl/image/th7hdrovmg8wislbnx0etukuvzg.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_upwvwaxwxum/tgkqw-jnn8i/aaaaaaaaew4/yez9rtuy9te/s1600/atlanterhavsveien.jpg ) and a bunch of [ these ] ( http://www.nasjonaleturistveger.no/no/turistvegene ) . 
  the obvious ones ( ferrari etc ) + some range rovers , some mercs and some lexuses are upper class in norway . 
  i 'll do the cars ferrari , lamborghini , koenigsegg , some porsches , some range rovers , some mercs and the rest of the sport/super/hyper cars . 
  i meant honey lager , and the name is just honey blonde lager . 
  i doubt they ship , it 's mainly a restaurant that brews their own beer on the side . 
  absolute shit customer service , unless you look like a million dollars you will get treated like shit by them . 
  i know a lot of people that initially wanted mercs but got turned off by the `` snobbiness '' of the dealerships . 
  very taboo in large parts of europe . 
  you can own a gun if you hunt big game and use it to execute wounded animals . 
  if you 're not a hunter then you would have to be in a gunclub . 
  but owning a gun is n't normal at all in norway .
