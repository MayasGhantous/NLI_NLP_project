  but i sure as hell think it should be legal , would take some of the pressure of the ridiculous drinking culture . 
  i just adressed this ( and more ) in the comment above ( or below , idk ) so quoting myself : this would depend on when you last visited norway , since 1998 the state are required by law to make sure new buildings/bridges etc contain a certain percentage of art . 
  only in the last 5 years i have noticed a visual change in the architecture landscape . 
  when i grew up most of norway looked like the 70s ( in the 90s ) with commie blocks etc. 
  now large parts of norway , most cities and even roads are clean , `` polished '' and beautiful . 
  take [ this ] ( http://www.nasjonaleturistveger.no/en/routes ) for example , some roads on the west coast that contains some tourist attractions have pitstops built along them that are architectural marvels . 
  oslo in the last 5 years or so have gone from good old oslo to a city booming with postmodern architecture like [ this ] ( https://avinor.no/contentassets/d59a292031a84f5193bded848a7533ff/barcode-oslo.jpg?preset=700 ) and a lot more .

  but as you say , `` average rich nordic country that accidentally became extra wealthy somewhere in the last century . '', 
  seems to be totally fitting for this development . 
  while norway have always been rich , lately we 've been dubai-rich and that has finally started showing in the landscape as well . 
  you could n't breathe the wealth ten years ago , but now you can in every single county of norway . 
  also i 've only visited one part of switzerland ( ticino ) , not even containing one of the larger cities so i could be wrong in saying that switzerland as a whole has that vibe to it , but ticino does at least . 
  if i 'm wrong then they fit the class i consider norway and denmark part of . 
  with us being one of the least densely populated countries in the world ( 14 pr km2 ) there should be a lot of places like that . 
  none,

  probably a very unpopular opinion , but nevertheless my opinion from my experience that i know i share with many norwegians . 
  i do n't know if this is a thing in other countries , but in norway we call countries u-land and i-land meaning utviklingsland ( development countries ) and industriland ( industry countries ) . 
  u land is the lesser and i-land is modern , developed etc. 
  so u-land generally includes african countries for example . 
  coming from norway to a foreign country , * almost * any country in the world feels like a u-land compared to norway . 
  the only exception i can think of would be denmark . 
  now i have n't been to all the countries , but i 've been to nearly all of europe and north-america and to me scandinavia as a whole is several steps ahead . 
  even switzerland has that u feel to it . 
  i 'm not saying germany , uk etc are like somalia . 
  but if there were more classes than `` u '' and `` i '' , something above `` i '' then we would fit in there while the rest of the modern , western world would fit the description i-land . 
  now this is purely subjectiv and something many norwegians agree on but also a thing that 's not at all spoken about because it 's an unpopular meaning . 
  if you look at the past 17 [ human development indexes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) you 'll see that norway is mostly in a league of it 's own with not even number two being close so there is some hard facts to back this up too . 
  so yes , [ it 's extremely taboo to say in norway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante ) but i feel that i live in a better country . 
  ** regarding the oil money ** i see many people here crediting norways success to . 
  we 've been among the top countries in female rights , gay rights , progressive laws , `` democracy '' , gdp per capita and several others for the last 200 years since the union with denmark seized and we stopped waging war and started building our country while the rest of europe continued fighting eachother and themselves . 
  the oil money have n't been used directly either since 2001 . 
  so to say it 's thanks to the oil is just wrong , look at the rest of the nordics with similar history , similar culture and similar constitutions - all have succeded with or without oil . 
  edit : typos, 
  even earlier too , at least in norways case . 
  same goes for social security , `` democracy '' , progressive laws etc. 
  statistically we 've been among the top countries since the 1800s .

  fridtjof nansen land also known as franz josef land are some islands next to svalbard that were part of norway from 1926 to 1929 .

  there is small a western separatism in norway , it 's far fetched but i believe most western norwegians would like it if it ever became a serious matter . 
  the main argument is that almost all of norways money is made in western norway and should stay in western norway . 
  also there are some minor cultural differences too . 
  but this has never been taken serious and it 's not a real separatist movement like in scotland or catalonia . 
  had to google it , but by the looks of it i would assume some kind of dessert . 
  breakfast is supposed to be relatively healthy , this does n't seem healthy . 
  some norwegians does n't like swedes because of the whole neutral thing during ww2 . 
  but those who do are n't exactly the brightest people and should n't be taken serious . 
  several times , it used to be the top vacation destination for norwegians until hell broke loose . . 
  a couple of beers and a burger is the usual at the local sports pub . 
  i do n't see how i can be proud of something i have n't affected in any way . 
  but i am impressed by their marketing skills and advanced technology . 
  no we do n't have any special holidays for them . 
  gas and electricity , which is mostly made by hydropower so gas and water . 
  we have a lot of bunkers left from the occupation during ww2 and most villages have at least one nuclear bunker left from the cold war . 
  most of the ww2 bunkers are either abandoned or used for tourism . 
  the cold war bunkers are mostly repurposed into storage etc. 
  it was pretty much non-existent up until the winter olympics im vancouver , because the team used some weir , colorful pants and did fairly well too . 
  after that they have pretty much faded away again , unfortunately . 
  sure was fun to watch . 
  it 's not building roads that 's the problem , but maintaining them . 
  low temperatures makes roads crack and most of norway has temperatures below 0 for half a year during the night which means that every night for about 6 months the ground freezes and cracks . 
  most of norway freezes during winter , which also is far longer in norway than countries further south . 
  because of this instability weather-wise we have to use winter tires for half the year which is n't exactly healthy for roads . 
  add on top of this a shit ton of rain and snow , a mountain to drive around , through or over every now and again it 's pretty understandable that roads are shit here . 
  the only way money could solve this is by inventing some asphalt that does n't crack in low temperatures and can withstand our weather . 
  my bad , i meant ferjefri e39 . 
  most of the new e39 will have 110 . 
  i do n't know the tunnel but probably less , which is understandable . 
  but yeah , super excited as it will be part of my daily commute when it 's done . 
  [ nordmannen by ivar aasen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_wm0mfatk4 ) . 
  the main argument against it being our national song is that it 's too norwegian . 
  i need my beautiful nature , so probably wyoming , montana , alaska etc. 
  cross-country skiing and womens handball . 
  also most other ski-related sports are pretty big . 
  luckily the new highway ( rogfast ) will have 110 most parts between kristiansand and trondheim . 
  and east of kristiansand there already is 110 km/h ( i think ) so hopefully 90km/h will soon be a thing og the past . 
  you try building roads in a country as mountainous as norway with winters at -30 and summers at +25 degrees . 
  keeping 90 km/h on the highway , you can easily cruise along in 100 or 110 without anyone batting an eye . 
  ( highways in the west have a 90 km/h limit ) . 
  i 've heard that if you drive like an asshole in safe circumstances your punishment will either be mild or non-existent .
