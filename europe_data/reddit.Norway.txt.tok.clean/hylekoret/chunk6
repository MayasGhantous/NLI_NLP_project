  switzerland truly is something special . 
  very different , but probably one of the most alike in mainland europe . 
   i get that they are simply different cultures , but in which way ? 
  probably in most ways but a few , it might be easier to ask what they have in common . 
  which beyond ranking on top of statistics is n't much , in my experience . 
  knut hamsun , one of the top authors in the world during the 20th century supported the nazis . 
  it 's often overlooked because his works are too amazing to dismiss because of his political views . 
  but many people consider him a a bad guy and a national treasure at the same time . 
  listhaug , the immigration and integration minister . 
  she is norways answer to trump . 
  also carl i hagen used to hold that title but he is retired . 
  i do n't see why people should downvote opinions , we 're not kids . 
  i agree on the northern feel , though this is more cultural than geographical and does n't change a nations geographical place on a map . 
  i wrote this about an hour ago to another guy arguing the uk was northern :  i 've always thought relative to the nordics the uk , netherland etc is n't really northern countries ... 
  but relative to the rest of europe sure , you are pretty northern . 
  i guess it depends on your perspective . 
  * fyi on the language bit , you should check out the norwegian dialect [ stavangersk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-jcik307dw ) ( most people in this video speak stavangersk ) . 
  people always assume i 'm dutch when i speak it abroad . . also if you can read danish you can read norwegian , in case you did n't know . 
  not a viking or a viking festival goer nor do i care about such festivals . 
  it seems okay , i guess . 
  for future reference scandinavia = sweden , norway and denmark nordic = sweden , norway , denmark , finland and iceland ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ estonia northern europe = complicated, 
   and i assume that you know that the largest viking festival that isnt in norway ... is in shetland . 
  this actually made me laugh irl . 
  no i certainly do n't know that and i bet 99 % of norwegians has no clue about viking festivals as well . 
  but yeah i see that the uk could be northern . 
  i 've always thought relative to the nordics the uk , netherland etc is n't really northern countries ... 
  but relative to the rest of europe sure , you are pretty northern . 
  i guess it depends on your perspective . 
  yup , as u/tetroxid said it 's not really a lot . 
  ~ ~ it 's actually officially considered poor . ~ ~ edit : i checked the statistics , the average is about 41k euros for full time shop assistant and therefore not considered poor . 
  the poor limit is 32k euros . 
  lifestyle philosophy ? 
  i believe everyone appreciates nice quiet time with family/friends . 
  in scandinavia it 's accompanied by coffee/cocoa in front of the fireplace . 
  in france/italy etc it 's a glass of wine , in finland it 's a couple bottles of finlandia in the sauna . 
  and so on , i do n't think having it cozy is a nordic phenomenon . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ he ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ protec ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ he ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ attac, 
  not that difficult , about 500 000 nok / 54 000 eur i believe is the official number a household needs per year to live a decent life . 
  the average was 70k eur and rising a couple of years ago when i read about it last time . 
  it 's near impossible to earn less than 30-35k eur yearly when working full time and most students start at between 35k-45k eur yearly when they get their first job . 
  most jobs pay at least 45k eur so add a wife/husband to that and you will live more than comfortably . 
  so to summarize , no matter the job you end up with you will likely be above the comfortable-life-yearly-wage . 
  i 've always been amazed by this , when i was young i worked in a warehouse where poles with masters in engineering etc settled for driving a truck or cleaning the floors . 
  the problem in norway is that teens feel they are above that sort of work and get useless masters instead and expect a job to land in their lap . 
  we sure could need some of that polish workmanship mentality . 
  i 've never been nuked either , just a precaution because i 've heard he gets trigger happy in the later stages of the game . 
  we have too many people taking higher education and too few ( norwegians ) doing actual physical work . 
  if it were n't for the baltics and poles we would n't have houses , roads etc. 
  to fight this the left want to make it harder to hire people temporary ( poles , lithuanians etc usually work periods in norway ) . 
  i do n't know what the right has said on this issue . 
  but other measures that are being taken is heavy marketing towards high school kids to choose vocational school or engineer school . 
  i always play as norway and i always get rid off gandhi before he gets his hands on some nukes . 
  not that common , it 's a shame because we have so much to offer . 
  race does n't determine you 're identity here . 
  know the language and you 'll be good . 
  huh , that 's weird . 
  i 've always been told it 's the nordics that are northern . 
  but okay , the more you know !, 
  i 've always heard nordic = northern and by logic countries between northern and southern should be central/western/eastern . 
  therefore i guessed netherland was central , but western would fit too i guess . 
  i thought netherland is ~ ~ central ~ ~ western europe ? 
  never heard anyone call it northern . 
  edit : in retrospect western seems more fitting . 
  it 's pretty damn great to live in a society where everything works as it should and a state that genuinly cares about everyones well being . 
  the only negative thing i can think of is the weather and the fact that we live so far away from the rest of europe . 
  the fact that a butter shortage a couple winters ago is one of the biggest scandals we 've had tell volumes on how lucky we are . 
  something that 's not that often told in media etc that to me is just as important as any other statistics is the scandinavian identity . 
  the fact that i feel at home in three countries is just amazing . 
  whenever i meet danes/swedes abroad in party places like ibiza , magaluf , napa etc we bond instantly and i think it 's truly amazing that three countries can have such good relationships . 
  b\u00e6rum france, 
  student , apartement through studentsamskipnaden and buy most of my food/beer in germany twice a year . 
  same , always fun when someone gives a shit about tiny norway . 
  where i 'm from most people have at least a family cabin , many have two cabins - one in the mountain for skiing and one in the south for warm weather . 
  many of them even have a third house in southern europe too . 
  so unless you 're from the west coast this trend seems to concern more than b\u00e6rum / asker which i 'm guessing you 're from . 
  france went all in and after a couple of hundred years they are n't even included in the credits anymore ... 
  only two families in norway with my last name . 
  my middle name might be one of the most common middle names . 
  i think it 's somewhat true . 
  in southern europe the smelly-people ratio is definitely higher than the rest of europe , in my experience . 
  it might be because of the warm weather or maybe deodorant is less common ? 
  would n't trigger me , but i 've triggered a lot of norwegians by saying the national football team were n't that good during the 90s . 
  transgender man who have n't done surgery yet ? 
  does that mean you are physically a man and mentally a woman or the other way around ? 
  i do n't think it 's taken seriously , it might even be illegal ? 
  ( children ) . 
  as for adults , nobody cares i would say . 
  so much , but to sum it all up you live in a two party `` dictatorship '' controlled by corporate america yet most americans swear that they are the best country in the world with the best democracy and the most freedom . . 
  i wish usa would wake up and demand a system that benefits the people and not corporations . 
  i am fuming :(, 
  no , but a * [ stamp ] ( http://dagalifjellpark.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/stamp-storm-vinter-dagalif-fjellpark-2015.jpg ) * is not uncommon outside cabins . 
  i do n't know if it has a real name , but a mall near a border , mostly used by the bordering people as their day to day shopping mall for groceries etc to save money . 
  i speak ( bad ) german too , just thought it should be made more of an effort in a `` border mall '' to speak at least english or the bordering language . 
  i met some germans in flensburg once that worked in a `` border mall '' , they did n't speak any danish or english . 
  pretty frustrating , should be mandatory to some degree when you work places like that . 
  i read spanish teacher as in a teacher from spain . 
  somehow the colombia part slipped my mind . 
  but yes , i know . 
  fixed it now , thx . 
  i would pick norway .
