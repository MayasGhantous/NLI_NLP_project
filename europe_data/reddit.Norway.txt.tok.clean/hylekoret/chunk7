  if a latino said this it must really be bad in the us . 
  latin countries are generally stereotyped to have `` clingy '' family relationships and it seems te be one of the more correct stereotypes . 
  as for me growing up in a normal norwegian family in norway : ** pick clothes : ** to some degree since i could point , did n't really care until i was a young teen though so not really a restriction from my parents ** make food ** : i would say when i stopped fucking around with spoons and everything else in my path so probably 5-6 ? 
  ** play outside ** : at 2 years i was put in the local playground with other kids . 
  but i grew up in a small , safe village though . 
  ** friends house alone ** : probably around 2 , my neighbour who lived just by the playground ** shop alone ** : at about 8 we would go to the local store and buy candy , at 12-14 we took the bus to the closest city for the cinema and more candy . 
  ** friend/shop without asking ** : when we got cellphones at ca 13 so we could contact our parents if something happened . 
  ** be in a relationship ** : no restrictions ** intimate relationship ** : no restrictions , just be safe . 
  does n't mean i was a 12 year old fuckboy , sex was a non-issue until i naturally wanted it and by that time i was a young teen and it was perfectly normal . 
  as for kissing etc then no age restriction . 
  ** leave campus/high school ** : it was allowed from 8th grade and upwards . 
  8th is the first grade of middle school to you , i think . 
  ** bathroom without asking ** : 1th grade in videreg\u00e5ende / 11th grade and upwards they stopped caring if we snuck out . 
  ** general freedum ** : 16 i would say , that 's when me and my friends started going on party trips around in europe . 
  i feel most are very free , but not as free as other european countries though , like denmark and germany . 
  kenya or cuba ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ norway, 
  i love the us and americans though . 
  i just said why i think you get such generalizations . 
  i would be fed up and mad , i get why you might be that because of this . 
  it 's just my understanding of why this generalization happens . 
  it 's bound to happen with 300 + million people in the states vs norway for example with 5 million , our dumb people hardly has a voice compared to the us . 
  says the dane . 
  if you 're not planning on seeing oslo or the eastern part of norway then i would n't bother since the norwegian foreigners learn is almost always eastern-norwegian . 
  the dialects vary so much that a 3 hour drive west from oslo would sound like a new language to you . 
  from where i live and 50km north there is at least 10 dialects that vary more than languages even . 
  also it 's true that most people are fluent in english , and especially in the west it would be easier for a native to switch to english than to eastern-norwegian ( me for example speak better english than eastern ) . 
  but then again , if you 're gifted it 's like 3 for 1 with danish and swedish and it even opens up for faroese . 
  icelandic is n't that hard to grasp either with a little practice . 
  learning norwegian would also let you read a bunch of old literature too as you mentioned so it depends what you want to use your norwegian for , a backpacking trip or further development . 
  your dumb people are very vocal . 
  oatmeal with either strawberries , black currant , raisins or banana in a bowl of milk/yoghurt . 
  it 's a bunch of more ways too to eat it , i know some people even find a way to throw sugar in the meal as well . 
  well not just fish and potatoes , ofc something green on the side and some kind of sauce . 
  i thought that was implied . 
  that kind of food is widely consumed in my circle , do n't know about the country but i would assume it 's common on the dinner table in norway . 
  breakfast : oatmeal and milk * lunch : slices of bread with shrimp/caviar * dinner : salmon/trout/cod and potatoes supper : a few slices of bread with mackerel in tomato a glass of either milk , water or juice goes to all of them . 
  this is what i perceive as a norwegian healthy diet , also in my opinion lunch is often overlooked or breakfast to many people . 
  i know some still use `` til vallhall '' as a warcry , which is about 1200 years old . 
  same, 
  pros : fish , oil , fjords etc cons : rough weather, 
  could n't find anyone walking around in the city as the nearby nature is marketed so heavily it eclipses the city , but : https://youtu.be/qf8vzi6tv30 and this one is a slideshow of the city : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=myxz7boyuns the first 15 seconds and then again at 1:31 they show some typical stavanger streets . 
  i like most of the clothes in urban outfitters , unfortunately that store is n't in norway as far as i know . 
  thanks to the tv-show how i met your mother i have to say minnesota vikings . 
  never watched a game of american football though but eventually i will and i will make sure it 's a vikings game . 
  it 's only the eastern dialects that 's melodic in norway , and that 's thanks to swedish influence . . 
  but yeah , danskj\u00e4vlar . 
  it 's covered by voluntary work actually , they travel in 10 . grade and from 8 . to 10 . 
  they work their asses of to earn enough money . 
  if a class does n't get enough money usually some rich parents steps in and donates the rest or they all chip in and donate . 
  yeah most kids cry at least once during the visit to auschwitz , and then again when they visit sachsenhausen on the drive home through germany . 
   there is much more to poland than auschwitz but it might be hard to find ... 
  i edited and added some more stuff but you replied before i was done . 
  so i 'll just quote myself . 
   during the stay in krakow most schools arrange a polish dinner with folk music , dance and traditional polish clothes . 
  i think this trip serves as a door opener to many people , poland is a very popular destination for weekend trips here in norway . 
  we send them to auschwitz . 
  / edgy s it 's become a tradition that when it 's time for ww2 and the cold war in history class we go for a school trip to auschwitz to see the horrors ourselves and not just read about them in books . 
  we also visit krakow and the salt mines + some places in germany as well . 
  during the stay in krakow most schools arrange a polish dinner with folk music , dance and traditional polish clothes . 
  pff , we 're the neutral ones . 
  you guys sing norwegian and danish people dry heave norwegian . 
  haha , people do swim in fjords . 
  it 's not that common though because it 's not that accessible to cars and it 's often freezing . 
  almost all norwegians go to poland on a school trip during middle school and prior to that we are obliged to do research and write papers on various places we are going to visit , even prepare questions for guides . 
  so your theory checks up . 
  it would probably be met with laughter as it 's hard to get the various cadences and dialects correctly and most foreigners who gives norwegian a go just sounds funny to us . 
  if you speak norwegian you can choose which language you want to use , most if not all norwegians speak english pretty well , people under 30 often fluently . 
  so it 's really up to the tourist what language he wants to speak . 
  but there is huge variations in dialect though so i bet most norwegians would answer in english as it 's easier than making their dialect clear enough for a foreigner to understand . 
  what 's so great about the national parks in your opinion ? 
  pff , that phoney thing is a vik . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.fjords.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/dsc_9011.jpg ) is a real fjord . 
  ** swedes ** are the biggest group , ** danish ** people are the second biggest . 
  basically the same people as norwegians only with a `` different language '' . 
  so yeah , obviously i like them . 
  ^ ^ ^ despite ^ ^ ^ danish ^ ^ ^ being ^ ^ ^ weird ^ ^ ^ as ^ ^ ^ fuck ** poles ** are the third biggest immigrant group . 
  i love them , they bring so much `` energy '' with them . 
  it 's impossible to go out drinking with a polak and have a bad time . 
  also they are notoriously good handymen , whenever a house needs painting , or any other manual labour we call up the local polaks and they will do a damn good job both fast and cheap . 
  * in oslo * - where is the fjords ? 
  usually with friends/family , and mainly to buy food/alcohol . 
  yeah i know , it 's even common in africa too i 've read . 
  but still it 's just so nasty to me . 
  almost dissapointed it was n't la libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple . 
  but yeah , i see how this might be a contender . 
  i see where theodor kittelsen got his inspiration from when he painted [ this ] ( http://harriet.nasjonalmuseet.no/ukenskunstverk/images/20091125173422_uke49.jpg ) now . 
  i agree it would be difficult , maybe even impossible to do this with the uk in particular , unfortunately . 
  but your round up does a good job though . 
  i think you can , this is just a what a guy who works for kilroy and has travelled a lot proposes . 
  i think we might have even nastier food . 
  blodpudding and other blood based foods makes me ill just by thinking about them . 
  no , it 's more geography that determines what the `` fancy food '' of your region is . 
  smalahove is mostly eaten in western norway , especially in the region hordaland . 
  still , during december it 's eaten all over norway as one of the three meals served to celebrate christmas . 
  i would 've bought me one of [ these ] ( http://travels.kilroy.no/flybilletter/jorden-rundt-reiser/mortens-megapakke ) world trips , this one is only 149 000kr = 15 700 euro . 
  which is cheap enough to live like a king while travelling too . 
  [ smalahove ] ( https://images.matprat.no/529888ccccbb73537a8b49bb-jumbotron/large ), 
  the israeli conflict does n't really have anything to do with religion . 
  yes , this is well known at least in my circle of norwegians . 
  there probably exists uninformed ones as well so i do n't know what `` the country '' knows about syria and its people .
