  [ j\u00e6rstrendene ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=j%c3%a6rstrendene&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjut_qrunnuahuiejokhf1ob1sq_auicigb&amp;biw=1824&amp;bih=1076 ) is a bunch of beaches along the south-western coast that all of rogaland goes to the few days we have good weather . 
  a neutral dialect in norway does n't exist . 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/3lmjippbvta?t=1m17s ) guy takes the dialects from fredrikstad with the swedish border , through oslo and along the coast to stavanger in west and then to the north . 
  the dialects are even more different further into the country . 
  if you find something here that sounds like the one you heard you could tell me the time it 's at and i can tell you what dialect it is . 
  i could n't find a video of spoken bokm\u00e5l though , simply because it 's only a written language . 
  we speak our dialect and write in either bokm\u00e5l or nynorsk , sometimes in dialect . 
  some oslo-dialects sound a lot like bokm\u00e5l though . 
  i do n't think it takes much to be more sexually open than usanians though . 
  they seem very conservative on all fronts , including sex and nudity . 
  btw are they really more religious than the us ? 
  every festival in norway is just a pop-shitshow . 
  so i 'm gon na pretend we 're still in union with denmark and tell you about [ roskilde ] ( http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/arts-events ) . 
  roskilde is a really artistic , hippie approach to a festival . 
  i feel it 's like the european equivalant of burning man . 
  there is probably more going on artistic-wise in norway , but i do n't know enough about it to really speak on it . 
  i do n't hang around there often enough to know the general inside jokes . 
  but judging by a quick glance it seems like corny wordplay makes up 90 % of the subreddit . 
  i thought scandinavia , germany and netherland was notorious for the chill attitude towards sex and nudity ? 
  at least that 's what i 've heard foreigners say about us . 
  i myself has always seen the southern part of europe as more religious and traditionally not as sexually open . 
  but i 've always perceived southern europe + france as more romantic though . 
  you can say whatever you want , but as soon as it 's directed towards a person it 's personal attack and can be fined/jailed . 
  ** which is a good thing ** . 
  well we have * a lot * of dialects in norway , even within oslo there is a bunch of dialects/sociolects , could be your teacher spoke a more neutral one ? 
  could also be that she spoke bokm\u00e5l , which is n't a dialect but is the most used written language . 
  when foreigners learn norwegian they tend to learn bokm\u00e5l first and then build some accent on top of that to make it sound like an eastern dialect . 
  extremely easy, 
  statistics from 2015 shows that 55 % lives in houses . 
  every post you post here i get the impression that you actually are just trying to tell us your opinions . 
  this does n't fly well on an ask-subreddit . 
  try cutting out your long descriptions , ask a question and do n't tell us all your thoughts around the subject and maybe you for once will be taken serious . 
  i would be shocked if i met a person who did n't know this . 
  yeah , it 's pretty fascinating . 
  oslo or eastern is closer related to english than western dialects which are closer related to icelandic and faroese . 
  bergen is probably the easiest western as it is heavily influenced by eastern dialect though . 
  reaaaaaally hard to choose just one , but gun to my head , probably the jimi hendrix experience . ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ rammstein, 
  well you 're tough to get through to . . breivik himself has said he is not christian , and has never been . 
  his thoughts is backed on islamophobia and far-right politics . 
  isis uses their interpretation of the quran as motivation and grounds for terrorism , their end goal is an islamic caliphate . 
  they are two different types of terrorists . 
  one is nationalistic/white supremacist motivated and the other is religious + kind of nationalistic motivated . 
  if you still do n't agree with facts then you can look it up on wikipedia or any encyclopedia . 
  there breivik is defined as a right-wing extremist while isis is defined as a salafi jihadism group - which in short means physical violence backed up by their perception of the quran . 
  they even explain why you might think breivik is/was or recognised himself as christian on wiki , at first he was broadcasted as a christian terrorist on the news but it has later been changed because it simply was n't true , it was a snap judgement in the heat of the moment that lead to a series of false news being spread . 
  i ca n't make it any clearer than this so i 'm gon na leave it at this . 
  thanks , changed it now . 
  you said he considered himself 100 % christian . 
  he does n't but in the manifest he defends christianity in a way that i understand is easy to perceive as him defending it from a christian perspective . 
  but he is defending it from a nationalistic perspective , as he has said himself later when this exact discussion was brought up in norwegian media . 
  so again , isis is a religious fanatic group and breivik was a righ-wing extreme = nazi . 
  as long as i understand the language it does n't matter , the first one i see in either language i understand is the one i will buy . 
  i 'm currently reading a danish book and the last one i read was in english . 
   do you think your response is similar for the country as a whole ? 
  i sure hope so , i think it 's healthy to read in other languages . 
  i know the younger ones have no language barrier when it comes to english . 
  when the newest harry potter book came it got sold out in a couple of hours even though it was in english . 
   for fun : what kinds of books do you read ? 
  i think overall it would be philosophical ( fiction ) like nietzsche , kirkegaard , sartre etc. 
  i 'm not a big fan of normal fiction but if any bookworms have any recommendations i am very interested in expanding into some other genres , i 've been stuck in philosophical works for quite a while now . 
  i like bergensk because it 's just so ... raw i think ? 
  also southern , mandal-ish is beautiful . 
  [ bergensk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i99q3k18t6c ) - the girl probably speaks an oslo-dialect and the man speaks a bergen-dialect , just goes to show how incredibly different dialects can be in norway . 
  ( also ignore the weird `` hallaien !, 
  '' , never heard it said like that ever . ), 
  [ southern , mandal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca7pjoqwwwq ) - widely recognised as the most beautiful dialect by most norwegians , including me . 
  no , he sees europe as a monotheistic christian continent . 
  in norway we have above 80 % members in the church . 
  among those 80 % i believe it 's about 80 % who consider themselves non-religious ( last time i checked ) . 
  it 's part of our culture and a tradition to be `` christian '' in norway . 
  therefore breivik as a fanatical nationalist values the norwegian christian culture and considers himself culturally christian just as almost every single norwegian does , regardless of their actual personal belief . 
  he has said this himself several times that he is n't christian , but think europe and norway should be christian and only christian continent/country . 
  so in short , breivik is a non-religious nazi . 
  isis on the other hand is short for ** islamic ** state of irak and syria . 
  to claim they are not islamic based extremists is just ignorant . 
  i think your system is ancient , undemocratic and unequipped to handle stuff like this and if a revolution is what it takes then it might be the healthier option in the long run . 
  our biggest internet/telephone company is owned by the state , we have 4g connection everywhere . 
  whenever i travel outside of norway i feel like im going back in time . 
  it 's baffling that just outside a big city in most other european countries you hardly get a signal . 
  now this may not have anything to do with the fact that the state owns the majority of the shares but it goes to show that it does n't exactly fuck it up either . 
  breivik is n't christian . 
   i come from one of the most nynorsk-speaking places in norway me too , and i have absolutely no problem with faroese . 
  especially spoken , it 's like a weirdly pronounced nynorsk based dialect . 
  icelandic on the other hand is harder , but if you read/listen closely you should get the general theme * at least * . 
  i know i do . 
  young people tend to be more polarized . 
  either they hate * insert nationality * or they love them . 
  since there is a lot of young people here i bet this contributes to this issue with online-hatred on reddit . 
  we refer to any sketchy driving maneuver as `` en spansk en '' which means `` a spanish one '' . 
   those surveys are always biased how ? 
   enjoy the darkness and cold . 
  darkness ? 
  it 's summer , which means 20 hours daylight where i live , even further north the sun never sets . 
  knut hamsun - sult ( hunger ) henrik ibsen - et dukkehjem ( a doll 's house ) brother robert - tristan og isolde ( the norwegian version ) and the basic viking sagas from norse mythology + some of the icelandic sagas . 
  all of these i believe every norwegian study extensively during high school . 
  [ yeah , it 's hard to be happy in the north . 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/worlds-happiest-countries-united-nations-2017/index.html ), 
  no , not yet . 
  although they want their football team to be recognised by fifa and uefa and are working towards that . 
  that 's pretty cool , i was only wondering because i 'm knee deep in a history degree myself , without any real goals or plans .
