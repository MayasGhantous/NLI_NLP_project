  always relieving to hear others that have managed to land jobs afterwards . 
  the show was completely remade into a norwegian equivalant , not translated like you are implying with your harry potter-analogies . 
  i only intended to answer the op , not claim national ownership over a tv-series original screenplay and lyrics . 
  how did that turn out for you ? 
  regardless of who wrote the original versions , they are songs from my country in `` engrish '' which is what the op asked . 
  if you listen closely the few words that are norwegian is in the most ... * special * dialect we have - tr\u00f8ndersk . 
  how a dane can think this is danish just goes to show how messed your language is , 
  [ the julekalender - it 's hard to be a nissemann ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7kj8pwa8pa ) [ the julekalender - the st\u00f8vel dance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sspsvhncykc ) they probably have a bunch of more songs but those are the two i could remember now . 
  where i 'm from in norway we call this tastaengelsk , named after a borough in stavanger where everyone stereotypically speaks shitty english . 
  [ til vallhall ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qp9eapa8dg ) - to vallhall * a * alt for norge - everything for norway for fedrelandet - for the * fatherland ^ ? 
  * for konge og fedreland - for the king and * fatherland * for konge , fedreland og flaggets heder - for the king , * fatherland * and the flags honor also the classics like hurra/hoorah , fremad ( charge ) etc. 
  norway in a nutshell, 
  nothing out of the ordinary . 
  i like the most of your culture , but the black stereotypes i ca n't stand . 
  i 've actually heard black norwegian women adopt ghetto/ratchet-slang and eat more chicken etc because that 's what their american counterpart seems to do . 
  it 's complicated . 
  i hate it , i love it and i love to hate it . 
  ideally i would like a climate where i only need one set of tires and never worry if it 's summer or winter the next day . 
  i ca n't remember , but from what i could find on google they were all built in case of nuclear bombs so i guess that 's what the drill was for . 
  i could only find ingrid , nora and aksel in the top 10 from 2016 that i feel is typical old-people-names . 
  fire drill is the only recurring one . 
  once when i was young we also hid in the school bunker as a drill . 
  never, 
  a little bit mixed , nobody cares . 
   it 's like calling a ~ ~ soccer ~ ~ ** football ** player ftfy, 
  i try, 
  kongsberg group from norway might be somewhat the same kind of corporation ? 
  best username i 've read in a while , made me laugh a little bit irl . 
  i thought i wrote it , but yeah those too . 
  i would migrate to the north pole if temperatures ever got so high here . 
  everyone , if cars in norway were as cheap as in almost any other country i bet ferrari would be one of the top selling cars here . 
  just to illustrate the extreme difference : mustang gt in sweden = 45 000 euros mustang gt in norway = 134 000 euros even though most cars are expensive as fuck to begin with , we make alot of money on average in norway so porsches , range rovers , teslas , bmw ( 5,6,7 , x5 and x6 ) , and the biggest audis are a fairly regular sight . 
  king k\u00fcngen loves strip clubs . 
  they go to oslo expecting to see fjords and mind blowing nature . 
  the fjords and everything beautiful is on the west coast and in northern norway . 
  it really irritates me that tourists wanting to see norway actually visits oslo at all . 
  ole gunnar solskj\u00e6r probably, 
  well liked , i guess . 
  they make the country work and we should all respect that . 
  this reminded me of [ this ] ( http://www.side3.no/motor/pris-i-norge-1296000---pris-i-sverige-428400-/3423221944.html ) article that shows the incredible difference between car prices in norway and sweden . 
  i envy you guys ... a mustang gt in norway : 1 296 000kr = 134 000 euros a mustang gt in sweden : 428 000kr = 45 000 euros, 
  67 % in favor of the monarchy last time they checked , january 2016 . 
  they are nice to have around for ceremonies etc , other than that i do n't care and probably not the rest of norway either . 
   is there any country in the european migration area do you mean schengen ? 
  in norway it 's not a guarantee to get a job , but it 's fairly easy to make it without any skills ^ ^ ^ ^ * listhaug * ^ norwegian_joke . 
  you are guaranteed financial support from the government until you find a job which they will help you with so it 's almost guaranteed . 
  so to answer you 're question , norway , sweden , denmark , finland and probably iceland as far as i know are all a part of schengen and can almost guarantee you a decent life with or without any prior skills . 
  being next to sweden . 
  how i used to experience swedish too , until [ zlatan completely shattered that perception ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbvdzq7uvpc ) . 
  swedish can be pretty badass if sung correctly . 
  well , neither of them are speaking finnish . . 
  but both guys always put a smile on my face because of their ridiculous accent though . 
  binge drinking , goes for all of northern europe . 
  it has gotten a bad rep lately , a popular `` saying '' in norway is `` fuck janteloven '' , usually by the same people that are vegans , pro third-gender option , feminist etc. 
  so take from that what you want . . 
  i personally believe janteloven is both nasty and great . 
  it 's vital to the nordic model though so i hope this bad rep is just a trend . 
  finnish is stereotyped , at least in norway to be something like `` hikki pikki ikikakikiki '' . 
  you always sound extremely happy , i ca n't even imagine how angry finnish would sound . 
  like even the word `` perkele '' sounds like a good thing . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akjf0md1kg8&amp;t=42s ) that went viral in norway when it came out accurately describes finnish to most norwegians . 
  [ hell ] ( http://images6.mygola.com/042ce35dbd7ebce84d8b8350fc183d64_1394232091_l.jpg ) on earth is in norway . 
  is there a big difference between catalan and spanish ? 
  those are some great words though . 
  and those guleb\u00f8j jokes you guys need to export more . 
  i had to google it although i feel like i already should know . . 
  hylekoret translates to screaming choir literally and means kind of whining choir . 
  our version of le pen/trump used this name to refer to her haters and generally anyone who disagrees with her . 
  it was really funny and got a lot of media attention when she said it so it was just the first thing on my mind when i made my reddit account during that period . 
  it 's also kind of cool that if im `` hylekoret '' then im agains listhaug ( the woman who said it ) and that means im probably not right leaning , and that i am sane . 
  i hope this will turn into playful banter sometime in the future . 
  theres nothing greater than fucking with swedes/danes . 
  i hope europe and usa too can have that kind of relationship in the future . 
  thank you so very much . 
  danish is basically norwegian so there you got two languages for one . 
  well it 's true , doubt all you want . 
  nynorsk is closer related to west nordic languages than to bokm\u00e5l . 
  being born and raised in a nynorsk municipality in a nynorsk county speaking a `` nynorsk dialect '' it 's a given that west nordic languages are easier to understand for us in western norway than those in east , north or south . 
  i ca n't speak them but i can understand much of it either written or spoken . 
  is there a lot of similarities between those languages ? 
  is it like danish , swedish and norwegian basically being the same language ? 
  no , i like that there is ice in drinks when it 's so extremely hot . 
  not british ? 
  never met or even heard of a norwegian jew . 
  we have [ tusenfryd ] ( http://tusenfryd.no/en ) in norway . 
  it 's the norwegian equivalant of six flags , a park focused on rollercoasters . 
  we have spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det ( language council ) , who often butcher english new words in hilarious ways . 
  like when segway became popular they named it `` st\u00e5hjuling '' in norwegian which literally translates to stand wheely and kind of translates to stand beating . 
  the typical norwegian has a villa in spain , a cabin in the mountains , drives either a cayenne or a tesla and still somehow worships [ the law of jante . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante ), 
   being barred from bars/clubs is n't racism ? 
  this is illegal in norway . 
  if you 're talking about europe you would have to ask people from the countries it happens in . 
  recently in norway a hairdresser lost three court cases and got some pretty hefty fines because she wanted to ban people with hijabs from her hair saloon . 
  if you 're talking about the guys that did n't get into nightclubs because of the dresscode that you linked . 
  this has nothing to do with their races and again goes to show how media can bend anything to fit their agenda . 
  several high profile clubs have very strict dress codes and will stop people at the door for wearing a hat , striped suit etc. 
  these people just happens to have another skin color . 
  these kinds of over sensitive interpretations can only be made when everthing is made into a racial matter and a huge public backlash is seen as positive . 
  that article would 've never been written in a mainstream norwegian newspaper because it 's like trump likes to call it , fake news .
