all i said in that comment is what someone might have said about the suggestion to create a jewish state there back in the day . 
  a bunch of european immigrants had no right to settle and take control over the land against the wishes of the locals and their neighbours , no matter what had happened back in europe , just because some of their ancestors lived there 2000 years ago . 
  someone had to be of that opinion then . 
   and give them which country ? 
  they have no land ... ~ ~ just a small piece that belonged to egypt ( gaza ) and another small piece that belonged to jordan ( west bank ) ~ ~ . 
  they have no modern history ... most of them have n't lived there for more than 2000 years ( check the immigration to the jewish so called territories in the last 50 years ) . 
  just because they happened to be on the lands where mandatory palestine was legally established it does n't mean they deserve a country . 
   - probably some guy when they suggested making israel . 
  norwegian : - nn : hjarte ( not included on the map , boo ! ), 
  lule : ts\u00e5hke pite : v\u00e1jbmo north : v\u00e1ibmu skolt : \u010d\u00e2\u00e2\u02b9\u0111 kildin : k\u016btt ' k ter : k\u0268dd ` ke, 
  to show it kinda differently , here 's old english . 
  let 's take a simple word , like `` stone '' . 
  old english `` stan '' . 
  x | singular | plural -- | -- | -- nominative | st\u0101n | st\u0101nas accusative | st\u0101n | st\u0101nas dative | st\u0101ne | st\u0101num genitive | st\u0101nes | st\u0101na in modern english it has two-four forms , depending on how you count . 
  either * stone-stones * or * stone-stone 's - stones-stones ' * . 
  old english have more !, 
  where modern english would use the same word in * `` from stones '' * and * `` stones gave me x '' * old english would use * `` from st\u0101num '' * and * '' st\u0101nas \u0121eaf m\u0113 x '' * . 
  i love the suspense , and kinda want to see trump win just to see what would happen . 
  only for a while . 
  - s\u00f8n was normal until around 1800 , and after 1850 - son became popular as well , along with - sen. 
  how can sweden and russia have less than estonia ? 
  han sei `` native language '' s\u00e5 vi sku nu egentle ha skrivvi dialekt kanskje ? 
  but here it seems everyone says `` mandag '' , which is not at all true . 
  adding both shows some of the variations at least . 
  it 's much closer to the dialects . 
  besides , the same can be said about gaelic . 
  1,1 % in scotland can speak it . 
  nynorsk have a higher percentage than gaelic , and a higher amount of users than icelandic . 
  they came from the north german-south jutland area , but they were primarily west germanic peoples . 
  not north germanic . 
  in norway there is of course two standardized forms . 
  so including only one does not give an accurate picture . 
  makes us seem closer to danish than swedish . 
  know of it . 
  have n't really been there though . 
  oh i have no such thing . 
  studying archaeology and old norse philology in oslo , currently in iceland for the autumn . 
  i 'm just quite interested in dialects . 
   most likely . 
  i guess ipa in / ... / instead of [ ... ] suggests a looser definition . 
  yeah . 
  / . . / is phonemic , [ . . ] is phonetic . 
  never seen that symbol used before , but looking at wikipedia it says this :  note : the low/low-mid vowels may be indicated differently : / \u00e6 / = / \u025b / / \u0252 / = / \u0254 / / \u0251 / = / a / so maybe different traditions ? 
  for the l i am no expert , but i imagine that a dark l would be just an allophone of l. 
  in norway and sweden the opposition to eu was/is a left wing thing . 
  conservatives love the eu here . 
  it 's not my opinion !, 
  it 's what everyone else says . 
  i took extra care to make sure to include dialects and minority languages even though they are n't national languages or majorities . 
  it 's everyone else in this thread who keeps complaining about skanian/bavarian/silesian words not being said any more , and are `` old fashioned '' . 
  i disagree !, 
  well everyone always says your language is almost dead and irrelevant . 
  replaced by castillian . 
  occitan might have been a better example though , if the 100k speakers wikipedia mentions are correct . 
  it 's the same as some say about the swedish dialects . 
  either i should include both or exclude both . 
  so many people are complaining that the dialects and/or minority languages i include are irrelevant or old fashioned . 
  estonian swedish . 
  the ricul dialect . 
   since literally no one speaks like that anymore . 
  surely there must be some . 
  in northern sweden i know plenty of people speaking quite heavy dialects . 
  is the north/south divide that strong ? 
  from what i see on dialect themed facebook pages they seem alive there at least . 
  still though , if i wanted to include only the most common form i would n't add estlandssvenska or asturian and such . 
  i 'll include a traditional form , as long as it has existed after 1900 . 
  glad i got something right :p, 
  according to wiktionary . 
   silesian : \u015bniyg m might be old fashioned though . 
  it 's not * completely * wrong . 
  i just chose an archaic word by mistake . 
  `` snjo '' you mean ? 
  no one says `` snlo '' . 
  but you 're wrong about `` nothing else in sweden '' !, 
  * sneyg\u02b7\u02b0 -  * sn\u00edg\u02b7\u02b0s  * sniks  nix  nivem/nive  neve latin word was `` nix '' , with accusative and ablative nivem/nive . 
  dialectal words . 
  i decided to add as many in sweden and denmark as i did in norway . 
  in denmark i could n't find much , but swedish has a bunch . 
  such as here : http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/sprak/dialekter/syd--och-vastsvensk-dialektdatabas/sok-i-databasen.html, 
  i was indeed thinking about the noun when i made this . 
  i was thinking about the noun when i made this . 
  french one was a mistake . 
  probably not much . 
  but `` schn\u00e4\u00e4 '' was listed as bavarian so i added it . 
  it 's from the northernmost municipality there , so it would n't be too weird if you use sn\u00f6 further south . 
  when it comes to \u00f6 vs \u00f8 i just copied what the book said . 
  thank you !, 
  snej is from a tiny german dialect . 
  vilamovian or whatever it was called . 
  i made the map . 
  and one of them is from a tiny german dialect . 
  i made the map . 
  most of the info is from here : http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/sprak/dialekter/syd--och-vastsvensk-dialektdatabas/sok-i-databasen.html \u00d8 vs \u00d6 depends entirely on the source i got the word from . 
  some prefer \u00d8 . 
  i 's not . 
  http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/sprak/dialekter/syd--och-vastsvensk-dialektdatabas/sok-i-databasen.html i made it . 
  if you search for the archaic swedish word `` bir '' in dialectal dictionaries you get stuff like : * normaliserad form : bir * dialektal form : bi\u00e4 * normaliserad form : birakimma ( \u00f6lk\u00e4rl ) * dialektal form : bietjimma both in sm\u00e5land , allbo h\u00e4rad . 
  if it 's imported from german or a variation of `` bir '' i am not confident in saying though . 
  here . 
  really useful dictionary .
