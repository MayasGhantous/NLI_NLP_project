  a nisse is kind of like a gnome of elf . 
  the name is likely related to a latin name , and not nordic . 
  old names include `` gardvor '' and `` tomte '' like in swedish . 
  it is directly evolved from various elves and such in norse belief . 
  some live in farms , barns and cellars . 
  others live in old burial mounds or such . 
  it 's common to sacrifice porridge or other food to the one on your farm . 
  `` the nisse '' is different from a normal `` nisse '' though . 
  he is just the one . 
  a santa-figure imported in the late 19th century . 
  before that we had goats and more horror than presents . 
  everyone slept on the floor christmas night , leaving out food so the dead may eat it during the night and not bother them . 
  and poor soul who got taken by the wild hunt . 
  there 's a lot of dialectal and cultural variations . 
  largely you have 4 main regions . 
  north , west , east and tr\u00f8ndelag / middle . 
  ( the last 100 years the south has kinda been counted as one as well ) . 
  a lot has been shaped on history . 
  which medieval bishopric we belonged to etc. 
  which 18th century administratory unit and such . 
  sometimes tribal names like raumar , tr\u00f8ndar , hadar and stuff go back to the viking age and beyond . 
  you also have a strong differences between coast/valley/lowland / city and such . 
  or just rural/urban . 
  urban is right wing , rural is left wing . 
  there are stereotypes abut everyone . 
  both between the main regions , and withing areas in the regions . 
  arcitecture has some differences . 
  [ here 's one from south-west on top , and tr\u00f8ndelag at the bottom ] ( https://www.miljolare.no/fagstoff/by/bilder/kkk_1.jpg ) . 
  * in eastern norway houses were often arranged in [ squares ] ( https://qa.landbruksdirektoratet.no/no/miljo-og-okologisk/kulturlandskap/utvalgte-kulturlandskap/oppland/_image/10619.png?_encoded=2f66666666666678302f35382f&amp;_ts=1297e9db680 ) around a yard in the hillside . 
  * in southern norway houses were placed in '' [ lines ] ( http://www2.geoatlas.no/wp-content/uploads/ga_legacy/9243.jpg ) '' , and usually close to others by the sea . 
  * western norway often had more `` simple '' houses , with stone roofs and planks on the walls . 
  arranged in '' [ clusters ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/havre01.jpg ) '' . 
  * central norway had the houses arranged in a '' [ square ] ( http://www.tronderbladet.no/incoming/article11596774.ece/dfp9j/alternates/w980-default/gammeltunet%20haanshus%202012.jpg ) '' , sometimes almsot completely closed . 
  the characteristic long '' [ tr\u00f8nderl\u00e5n ] ( http://www.kreativetrondelag.no/upload/kulturminnearet_2009/bilder/drivstua%20hovedbygning%202005.%20tr%c3%b8nderl%c3%a5n%20oppf%c3%b8rt%20i%20tre%20etapper%20-%20%20foto%20finn%20damstuen_1.jpg ) '' house was ( [ and is ] ( http://bloggfiler.no/hus22.blogg.no/images/657118-8-1409307719539.jpg ) ) almost universal here . 
  * northern norway varied , with houses similar to those in tr\u00f8ndelag in the south , but with clusters similar to western norway often . 
  also the most northern parts have strong influences from sami buildings , and from the cononists from other parts of norway going there in the 19th century . 
  for the way of life there are some differences , but often not on a regional level . 
  by the coast they fish . 
  in the inland they farm sheep , and in the lowlands they farm grain . 
  that 's true in all of norway . 
  as i said in the start language is the biggest marker . 
  you can tell where someone is from by the way they speak quite easily . 
  sometimes down to the valley . 
  for example the word for `` i '' is j\u00e6i , eg , e , je , ei , \u00c6g , \u00c6 , i and eig . 
   what do you think about this term ? 
   is it a term that is also used in your country ? 
  more or less same in norway . 
  very fitting i think . 
  most people do n't care about religion too much . 
   because if you want to be an atheist you have to not celebrate any obviously religious holidays , like christmas , ~ ~ easter ~ ~ , st. johns day and evening , fastelavn besides easter , all of those have long pre-chistian traditions in scandinavia . 
  celebrating them as an atheist purely for cultural reasons should not be problematic , especially if you tone down some of the newer religious traits and focus on fun , horror/evil and partying . 
  all heathens and atheists i know like christmas . 
  important part of history class , and seen as a indirect source of lots of political and cultural things . 
  i am not sure how much people feel connected to it though . 
  we were never a part of it or anything . 
  only alliances/trade . 
  christianity gave us most of the roman thing , not the romans themselves . 
  so maybe we sympathise more with the barbarians they conquered and enslaved ? 
  or that might just be me . 
  the forced assimilation of sami people . 
  making their language illegal in schools , sometimes even taking their kids away to make them grow up `` properly '' . 
  forcing them to have a `` norwegian '' name to do certain things . 
  it has gotten much better , but some languages seem too far gone to save . 
  south sami has only 500 speakers left scattered in norway and sweden , and just a handful students going to sami-language school . 
  would n't that be more of a dialect than an accent ? 
  various rural areas hit hard by depopulation hand out cheep or even free areas to build on if you move there . 
  often you need to have a family . 
  even more places have really really cheep houses . 
  also some places in the north are except from certain taxes to make people stay there . 
   ( not many people have nicknames in norway ) you have n't been much to tr\u00f8ndelag then !, 
  always just a plain `` du '' or `` you '' . 
  or first name . 
  neither titles like `` herr '' or polite forms of the pronoun like `` de '' feels natural to me . 
  though i guess you could do it . 
  of somewhat common food . 
  in no particular order , depending on my mood : * roasted chicken . 
  or maybe deep fried ? 
  that 's rare to find though . 
  * smoked/grilled trout , charr or salmon * klubb & duppe ( barley/potato dumplings , served with a whey sauce , syrup and bacon .

  eaten on thursdays !, 
  * [ f\u00e5rik\u00e5l ] ( http://www.helleskitchen.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/img_9285.jpg ) . 
  national dish . 
  sheep and cabbage boiled with some salt and pepper . 
  no need to improve what 's already perfect . 
  * cured meats . 
  sausages , dried hearts and legs . 
  served with potato salad and flatbread . 
  always awesome . 
  never heard about them !, 
  what 's the use of them anyway ? 
  are there masses ? 
  or is it just a place to pray or something ? 
  i ca n't see the use in any case . 
  you are rarely far from a normal church . 
  that 's kinda their point , being placed centrally and all . 
  usually close to the main paths . 
  same in norway !, 
  but usually at christmas , actually . 
  personally it i find it hard to choose between northern and western norway .
