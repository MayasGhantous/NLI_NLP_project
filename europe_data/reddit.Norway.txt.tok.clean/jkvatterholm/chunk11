  with fjords and valleys . 
  [ pic ] ( http://www.smp.no/incoming/article8483555.ece/binary/w980/indre%20nordfjord.jpg ) . 
  m\u00f8re og romsdal and hordaland are also pretty places . 
  and [ tr\u00f8ndelag ] ( http://www.beetlebee.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/20140720_165100.jpg ) and the [ inland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/skutelen.jpg ) is also underestimated . 
  * ** norway ** ( home ) * ** sweden ** ( many times per year ) * ** denmark ** ( many times . 
  but only jutland . 
  copenhagen once last month ) * ** iceland ** ( lived there ) * ** estonia ** * ** germany ** ( barely south of the historical danish border ) * ** england ** ( only london ) * ** bulgaria ** * ** portugal ** ( only as a kid ) * ** turkey ** ( asian part ) never been further away than that . 
  i liked all of them though !, 
  bulgaria and portugal were really kinda boring trips with family just for the beaches and sun , but i have no doubt they would be more fun if i travelled around more . 
  estonia is probably the one who went above my expectations . 
  tallinn was lovely !, 
  wear a good outer jacket and a insulating layer of wool close to your skin usually does the trick . 
  and good shoes and a hat of course . 
  but we live kinda rural , so we do n't stay out that much when it 's that cold . 
  mostly just move between the house and car and store . 
  i remember waiting for the school bus one day in that cold , and it never came though . 
  that was n't fun . 
  had to walk half an hour back to the house without winter pants on . 
  do n't think i 've been out for long in anything like -30 . 
  * * spring * : somewhere in between . 
  lots of rain . 
  can have nice weather or cold weather . 
  * * winter * : usually +5 to -10 degrees . 
  periods of snow and no snow . 
  coldest in january usually , with down to -20 where i live . 
  up in the valley it can be -30 . 
  rain during the warmer periods . 
  sometimes dry winters with no snow , only frost . 
  * * summer * : rain or sunshine . 
  usually between 5 and 20 degrees . 
  can get up to 30 sometimes in july . 
  * * autumn * : pretty colours . 
  usually not freezing until november , with the first snow . 
  otherwise much rain . 
  sweden by far !, 
  i live a couple hours from the border to ~ ~ illegally occupied norwegian territories ~ ~ sweden , while denmark is far away and speak weird . 
  usually various cakes mostly . 
  in some old saying you should make 7 kinds for christmas .

  you have to carry id ? 
  just for going to town to buy milk or whatever as well ? 
  absolut vodka , 700ml : sweden : 239kr norway : 314kr it adds up !, 
  we go to sweden many times a year to buy cheep liquor and bacon . 
  as `` m\u00e6kdonals '' . 
  which is kinda the same as `` mac donalds '' i guess . 
  not even in schools and such ? 
  ours always had that . 
  it 's in the corner most of the time , we just pull it out to the middle when it 's time . 
  it 's mostly for the kids anyway . 
  we hold hands and walk around it , singing some songs . 
  kind of a broad question , but : on the 23rd we put out porridge for the `` nisse '' and other elves . 
  then we wake up the 24th , having cleaned and decorated earlier . 
  we then watch cartoons ( [ usually this horribly dubbed czechoslovak film ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbav5gyyw0m ) ) and eat a nice breakfast , getting ready for dinner later . 
  usually at home . 
  a few go to church . 
  sometimes breakfast gets late , so we only do dinner . 
  then we either go to where the family gathering is , of prepare to host it . 
  we drink coffee and stuff , and at some point walk around the tree . 
  then the americanised santa comes with a few presents , most already there , and the kids can open them . 
  then more coffee and cakes while the kids play . 
  we watch the king 's speech on tv , and [ this traditional film ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky3ynobhi88 ) . 
  then comes the christmas night , which has traditionally been a dangerous night full of magic and dead people , though no one cares about that any more . 
  then there is various customs on each day until new year . 
  i never knew you even had them there !, 
  i always thought of it as living far from humans up in the mountains . 
  does n't seem to fit in the netherlands . 
  * [ mountain grouse ] ( https://media.snl.no/system/images/3639/standard_fjellrype__e2_80_93_1_1.jpg ) * [ forest grouse ] ( http://birdphotos.jalbum.net/bird%20photos/h%c3%b8nsefugl/lirype/slides/lirype%20skalstufjellet-0753.jpg ) * [ black grouse ] ( https://www.miljolare.no/innsendt/bilder/artstre/1323/thumb/orrhane_liten/320x240.jpg ) * [ and `` capercaillie '' ] ( http://img8.custompublish.com/getfile.php/1235108.758.ptpdcdyyaa/632x0/4784903_1235108.jpg ) and some goose and duck and stuff in the seasons for that . 
  some less common species to hunt are doves and crows and that sort of things . 
  the law says you have to hunt ? 
  i quite like this one i took from a hill . 
  it 's not my list , it 's just the cities mentioned most often in other threads . 
  i did n't think anything special of it . 
  it 's not ? 
  damn , i just googled it for a picture . 
  only been there once . 
  after some googling , some towns came up often in each such thread : * [ narvik ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/norway_narvik_3.jpg ) . 
  * [ odda ] ( http://gfx.dagbladet.no/labrador/216/216827/21682752/jpg/active/978x.jpg ) . 
  * [ sortland ] ( http://www.nfk.no/handlers/bv.ashx/i2dd271b2-7656-48ae-b1e0-6416deee4bcf/prosjekter_i_sortlands_sjoeside.jpg ) . 
  * [ molde ] ( http://www.campusonline.no/bilder/bilder/miljobilder/molde.jpg ) . 
  common complaints : soviet brutalist or modernist architecture , and dead or dirty town centres . 
  i do n't know what my personal opinion is is . 
  i 've been to multiple of these . 
  probably just used to it . 
  i love the way various other north germanic dialects like finnish-swedish , icelandic , faroese and v\u00e4rmlandska . 
  some others not so much . 
  but that 's all bias . 
  [ sami ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntnqi7xjlzs ) and finnish is also pretty . 
  outside the nordic countries i love welsh and various romance dialects . 
  some dialects have even more or less merged the two , except in nouns related to mass . 
  in western jutland . 
  very visible in norway in many cases . 
  kinda the same way in sweden ( and maybe denmark/finnland ? ), 
  in the cities you have liberals/conservatives , and in the countryside you have more left-leaning people . 
  at least in the economical side of things at least . 
  labour ( and agricultural parties ) almost always win rural norway and northern sweden for example .
