  [ swedish election map by majority ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/st%c3%b6rsta_parti_efter_kommun%2c_riksdagsvalet_2014.png ) . 
  [ here 's the votes for the conservative party ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/norwegian_parliamentary_election_2009_map_h_votes.svg/952px-norwegian_parliamentary_election_2009_map_h_votes.svg.png ) in norway . 
  rural areas barely vote for them . 
  [ here 's the 1994 referendum ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jvjvwc2.png ) on joining the eu . 
  the right-leaning people and leaders were for it , while the left-leaning and agriculture/fishing people were against it . 
  compare that to [ the population density . 
  ] ( http://67.media.tumblr.com/9e099623ccc2ddcaa7b683bd28cbc475/tumblr_n3affhmbcp1rasnq9o1_1280.gif ) they fit almost perfectly together , down to each municipality !, 
  do n't know how `` official '' it is , but [ here 's one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkug_jzbm4 ) for my region . 
  i 've seen a few of these from various rural areas of norway . 
  [ here 's a bit longer one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bxzum5ft7w ) from gausdal . 
  i think it 's the municipality who makes them . 
  most towns in norway are n't that old . 
  a few medieval , some 16-1800 , and most later than that . 
  most places i know have various regulation . 
  mostly it has to do with simple things such as the height of buildings , unless it 's in a particularly distinct area with old houses . 
  [ here 's a typical street ] ( http://www.t-a.no/incoming/article10490493.ece/nqxp0q/binary/w980/levanger.jpg ) with houses from the 1800 's . 
  the houses are protected , and changing them is rarely allowed . 
  but no one copies them , so most new houses are modern . 
  a few words is totally fine !, 
  it 's it might be recommended even . 
  it only gets weird when they start changing the entire grammar . 
  and i can understand having problems after living here for ages . 
  maybe a bigger part of the problem for me is that the ones i know who are like that does n't do it very well . 
  i only have problem with the `` change on day one , trying ( failing ) to sound like you are from oslo no matter where you actually are '' - types . 
  i just ca n't see the point . 
  i understand swedish perfectly well , and you 'll sound swedish almost no matter what . 
  changing a couple of words is okay , but trying to pull off a oslo-accent while speaking with someone in another part of norway just sounds weird . 
  most do n't . 
  some do . 
  and i agree that it is cringey when they do . 
  your average swedish sound , well , swedish . 
  there is this notable accent that is so easy to hear . 
  even for swedes who have lived in norway for years , it 's still easy easy to hear that they are swedes . 
  just speak swedish !, 
  you wo n't get rid of that accent anyway . 
  there there is of course big differences from area to area . 
  scanian , or v\u00e4rmland for example . 
  v\u00e4rmland sounds like eastern norwegian to me , with weird words . 
  and some dialects in dalarne and j\u00e4mtland which sounds like more central norwegian mixed with other stuff . 
  and [ dialects from \u00d6sterbotten ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ltg6xyzbtu ) which sounds like it could have been spoken in norway , just a little finnish . 
  there 's not * that * much in norwegian , but it would be enough for most things . 
  forums , wikipedia that sort of things . 
  but there is just so much more in english !, 
  especially if you 're like me and like things like langauges and maps . 
  if i want to look up a random island in the middle of the ocean i 'll always open the english-wikipedia article because it has much more info . 
  european, 
  no way . 
  i probably could n't hear the difference between frisian even . 
  i do n't exactly heard dutch every day . 
  similarly i doubt you would know the difference between southern and northern norway . 
  all the nordic ones easy . 
  english , spanish , portugese , french , italian , greek , welsh , hungarian , dutch and german would be easy . 
  finnish-karelian-estonian would be harder . 
  same with most slavic languages . 
  romanian i have little experience with . 
  latvian-lithuanian i know nothing about . 
  same with albanian . 
  irish-scottish gaelic same . 
  smaller romance languages would be impossible . 
  by looking at the average commercial we can see : * all announcers on fancy thin , stone-baked pizzas get italian accents . 
  * thicker pizzas with stuff like jalape\u00f1os and such stuff get american voices . 
  * generic norwegian frozen pizza can get whatever . 
  not even petrol stations ? 
  it 's their main hot meal here by far . 
  and of course , everyone eats them on the national day . 
  preferably with [ thin potato bread ] ( http://www.adressa.no/familieogoppvekst/article9669481.ece/alternates/w980-default/pristest02-h9uhirozjp.jpg ) . 
  really ? 
  here it 's seen as a more danish/german thing . 
  barbecue ribs and that sort of thing . 
  maybe various tex-mex . 
  food like hamburger , pizza * and other such fast food things are too common and everyday meals . 
  they are not really seen as foreign any more . 
  ** not the kinds we think about as `` italian '' pizza . 
  only the very `` american '' ones . 
  apparently 98 % jill stein , though many questions were too american . 
  all the parties seem to be too much right wing for me . 
  if it says fine wheat flour then i doubt it would change much from time to time and brand to brand . 
  same with sugar . 
  how about things like flour and sugar ? 
  we always use that by volume . 
  everyone has one , but at least we rarely used it . 
  most recipes are in litres or other volume units , and the butter has weight markings on the packaging , so no reason to measure that . 
  maybe used a bit for baking more fancy things . 
  we use measuring jugs like [ this ] ( http://galligani.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/m%c3%a5lebeger-1l-175-.png ) and [ this ] ( http://images.biltema.com/paxtoimageservice.svc/article/xlarge/85958 ) all the time though . 
  there 's a load of names for them !, 
  * klubb/kl \u00f8bb in central norway . 
  * palt in northern sweden and central norway . 
  * raspeball or just ball : western and eastern norway * kumpe : west and south norway * kumle : south and west * klot : some places and then there are differences if there is blood in it or not . 
  it 's not eaten in easten norway though , for some reason . 
  [ klubb og duppe ] ( http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/11849444_883134911741111_1029936732_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=mta3njezmtq5oti3nza1odk5nw%3d%3d.2 ) . 
  a regional dish made from dumplings of potato and barley , served with sweet whey sauce , bacon and syrup/sugar !, 
  traditionally eaten thursdays . 
  and [ rotgraut ] ( https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/11356529_917510501624990_254168829_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=njy4odmzndg0ode1mtg2mtcw.2 ) . 
  it 's mashed [ rutabaga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rutabaga ) / turnip , potatoes and carrots . 
  mixed with broth and served with meat . 
  it 's amazing and filling . 
   how american do you feel ? 
  about as much as i feel english , greek or russian . 
  not very . 
  well , your elections are very entertaining to watch !,
