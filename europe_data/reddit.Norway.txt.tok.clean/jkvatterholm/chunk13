  it 's still a queue even if it 's 5 people wide and 3 people deep :(, 
   like i said , i 'm on my phone ... that 's okay , no haste . 
   fredrik lindstr\u00f6m 's svenska dialektmysterier can act as an introduction , but far from complete analysis . 
  https://youtu.be/qjsndhwrd58 to me , it could might as well be yiddish or afrikaans . 
  i 've seen that episode before . 
  it is quite difficult to understand for me to , but not any worse than sk\u00e5nska . 
   that 's the thing , they differ from swedish and norwegian , and even differ from old norse . 
  every dialect differ . 
  and it looks pretty similar to every other dialect descending from old norse . 
   and yes , they have the nominative / dative cases , just like \u00c4lvdalska , etc. . . 
  the question is does it / mark / the accusative case ? 
  only icelandic/faroese and \u00c4lvdalska / orsm\u00e5l actually mark that case . 
  but a whole lot of dialects mark the dative as different from nominative/accusative ( which is the same ) . 
   the oldeat roots ( i believe ) are some traces from proto-norse in the form of differences in diphtongs and vole sounds , that evolved elsewhere between proto - and old norse ... and some odd few very old fashioned words ( or word roots ) the diphthongs are preserved in most of north and east swedish though , just like norwegian . 
  just seems like something happening the last 1000 years . 
  it 's just ei , ey and au + secondary diphthongs , right ? 
   then there some verb cases that has been preserved from that time . 
  accusative / dative , like in icelandic ... and other small stuff . 
  do you really separate accusative from nominative ? 
  as far as i have seen you just have the difference in nominativ/dativ , just like my dialect . 
  i have only found \u00c4lvdalska + orsam\u00e5l to still have accusative in the mainland . 
  i 'd love some details . 
  i 've looked up that dialect before , but did n't really see anything special that does n't look like a recent invention . 
   including some bonschka dialects which are remnants of a nordic language seperate from old norse . 
  with some rare traces or proto-norse ... 
  i 'm not so sure it 's that old . 
  you 're the first one who has ever claimed that , and i 've read quite a bit about them . 
  what things are different from east and west norse ? 
  * kindergarten , optional . 
  i had 1 year . 
  * elementary school at age 6 . 
  classes 1-7 . 
  * lower secondary starts at year 8-10 . 
  these are a bit more centralised . 
  my area has 6 elementary schools , but two of these . 
  * then you start upper secondary school . 
  this one is not mandatory , but everyone has a right to it . 
  it is 3-4 years , and can be various lines . 
  study-preparation , sports , singing , electricity , farming , it , and all kinds of trades . 
  each school only have some , or are specialised for one . 
  especially farming schools , due to need for equipment and buildings . 
  after finishing a trade , you can take one extra year of generic maths and language to prepare for study . 
  if you learn a trade you usually do an internship 2 of the years . 
  * many do a '' [ folkeh\u00f8gskole ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/folk_high_school ) '' before university . 
  i did n't . 
  these are not free , and private , but teach anything from refreshing your maths , to building and sailing ships . 
  i was kinda jealous of my friend for choosing that . . * university is free and you get grants and loans to pay for housing and food . 
  getting in to a program depends on your grades , so `` everyone '' can do generic history in most places , but only a few can do more specialised programs . 
  some courses also require specific high school courses beforehand . 
  kinda this lost relative that we for some reason does n't talk much to . 
  i mean , we have had a lot or relations with them through history . 
  and their climate * kinda * similar . 
  * the rus * fishing and trade along kola . 
  murmansk is named after `` northman '' !, 
  * russo-norwegian pidgin language up there . 
  * bordering them from 1500 up to today ( except 1920-1944 ) . 
  * helped us during the war . 
  my great grandfather was a part of the soviet campaign into northern norway . 
  and a lot of `` personal '' stuff , such as how we every year honour the local soviets who died as german prisoners of war in my town during the war . 
  the russian ambassador has come many times . 
  it 's one of the few soviet graves that were n't dug up and destroyed during the cold war , due to locals protecting it . 
  but still they always seem so secluded to us , due to our goverments ' politics . 
  especially in the cold war and in the most recent years . 
  sorry , must have misread . 
  according to wiktionary ( `` general american '' ) : / b\u025dd / , / \u0261\u025dl / , / w\u025dm / these are `` r-colored vowels '' . 
  they are still vowels , are n't they ? 
  / brd / would be impossible . 
  well , here we never really focused much on the pacific , so obviously the soviet union gets a much bigger part of the honour . 
  also they actually fought in norway , after the french and british pulled back years earlier . 
  my great grandfather was a part of the soviet campaign in northern norway after getting training in sweden , so this also influences it a lot . 
  not that the allies did n't do anything . 
  they had our government in exile , and landed in france and italy . 
  but my teacher was of the opinion that the soviets would and could continue to the british channel if not . 
  but what about / \u025c\u02d0 / ? 
  you must be mistaken something . 
  / b\u025c\u02d0d / , / \u0261\u025c\u02d0l / , / l\u025c\u02d0n / etc. 
   it 's not like an accent/dialect thing where they just drop it because they 're lazy that 's not how dialects work . . 
  it 's not used a lot any more . 
  and it was only really used as a name for the meal or time for the meal . 
  probably a rural thing . 
  the 1873 dictionary calls it `` pretty common '' . 
  i have never even heard anyone talk about bitcoin irl . 
  doing some googling it seems a few online stores accept it . 
  other than that it 's more or less unheard of . 
  there is almost no way to get around without a car . 
  walk or bike or ski , and who wants to walk an hour ? 
  if you get to town there is a train going north-south , but other than that you are depending on cars to get between towns . 
  i think there are a bus that goes once a day . 
  and some expensive taxis . 
  yeah , `` non '' is around 15.00 in norway . 
   terminology differ with dialects and such . 
  to me `` middag '' is a fancier dinner ( for gatherings , festivities , and such ; banquets etc. ) . 
  what do you call a normal dinner then ? 
  i think they got off around 15 . 
  did n't get back until around 16 usually . 
  my mother is a secretary , so she starts quite early . 
  father came a bit later . 
   i do n't see what the amount of salt has anything to do with it . 
  a little more salt and it would be saltfisk . 
  a bit less and it would be rotten fish .
