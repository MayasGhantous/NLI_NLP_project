  and you 're right . 
  you could argue even h\u00e1karl is kinda the same . 
  i did put it in the fridge , but it stayed for about two months . 
  is that too long ? 
  i 've tasted plenty of nordic fish-dishes . 
  ranking those that may apply from good to worst : 1 . 
  [ dry fish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockfish ) . 
  i can eat this as snacks . 
  no problem . 
  [ gravlaks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gravlax ) : rakfisk `` light '' . 
  good fish . 
  eaten as you would smoked fish . 
  dry fish watered out in a solution with lye . 
  i 'm not the biggest fan , but i eat it . 
  usually with healthy amounts of bacon along with the fish . 
  texture is the worst . 
  [ rakfisk ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/rakfisk ) . 
  kinda the same `` ferment it with * just * enough salt not to spoil it '' mentality as surstr\u00f8mming . 
  just better . 
  i prefer smoked fish , but it 's good . 
  also is usually trout . 
  [ h\u00e1karl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%a1karl ) . 
  icelandic fermented shark . 
  this one is pretty bad , but the urine-smell is the worst . 
  chew it for a wile and it just tastes of dry fish . 
  texture is normal . 
  surstr\u00f6mming . 
  the worst . 
  the smell is the worst part , but the taste is no good either . 
  just salt and horrible . 
  the look is the worst though . 
  if it was just filets it would probably be better , but with that grey gunk inside . . no thanks . 
  yeah , there might be a few frp and rhe like , but other than that it 's always : ap , sp and a few h\u00f8yre . 
  at least where i live . 
  i think most of the ap-voters would love sv , but disagrees on wolves , environment and such . 
  ( left wing , not that many socialists . 
  though there are quite a few ! ), 
  moonshine , cars , hunting , left wing , anti-eu , pro-agriculture , r\u00e5narar / raggare , different kinds of country music and old dialects ? 
  and probably many other parts of norway and sweden . 
  i really like [ nordmannen/millom bakkar of berg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_wm0mfatk4 ) . 
  written by ivar aasen himself 1863 . 
   let the others fight for greatness , let them thrive with power and wealth , amongst gentlemen i do n't belong , amongst equals is where i feel at home of course there are a bunch more . 
  but this is the one that comes to mind . 
  if you by `` european military '' mean an eu military then i 'm not sure what to think about it , but then i am not in favour of getting any closer to the eu , so hopefully it would n't affect us much in any case . 
  i 'm not particularly in favour of nato either , so i ca n't really support the idea . 
  that 's not at all what i 've seen from tourists . 
  most of them go to [ trolltunga ] ( https://res-4.cloudinary.com/simpleview/image/fetch/c_limit,f_jpg,q_64,w_800/http://media.tellus.no/images/%3fd%3d72%26p%3d5214%26t%3d4&amp;.jpg ) , [ preikestolen ] ( http://v.imgi.no/qprfatfzkf/ ) or some fjord or other famous mountain . 
  northern norway is also very popular . 
  but more or less only the area between bod\u00f8-lofoten-troms\u00f8 . 
  oslo is popular just because it 's the capital and big . 
  the rest of tr\u00f8ndelag , \u00d8stlandet etc. 
  are boring in comparison . 
  ( with exceptions !, 
  but no one goes to rondane or fosen and all that ) but i guess it 's a much shorter travel for swedes . 
  same reason we go to j\u00e4mtland , dalarne and norrland in the summer i guess . 
  central norway . 
  we get 3 kinds : * foreigners visiting friends . 
  * foreigners travelling to another part of norway . 
  mostly russian , polish , baltic and russian . 
  they are a good addition to the income the one month you might see some i suppose . 
  well , nato have military exercises here in northern norway , in the county bordering russia . 
  it 's not something only they do . 
  besides norwegian : english and icelandic . 
  living as an exchange student . 
   nordic ( most notably icelandic and norwegian ) does the dialects matter anything in this ? 
  or is that hard to hear for foreigners ? 
  it really depends on who speaks it and how . 
  any language can be amazing or ugly based on that . 
  i do love welsh , scots , finnish and a few others a whole lot though . 
  not really . 
  just park the wagon the same way you might put a bike up against a wall . 
  maybe if i talk to someone from america or something . 
  my region is the most important , then norway and the nordic nations . 
  yeah . 
  could have clarified a lot of stuff . 
  we do have writing , but it 's only stuff like :  hadulaikar ek hagusta ( l ) dar hlaaiwido magu minino `` handulaikaz ( lies here ) , i hagustaldaz , buried son mine . '', 
  not exactly too much help , besides the state of the language . 
  many farms have had the same name and location for over a thousand years . 
  possibly much longer . 
  it 's impossible to prove or disprove , but many claim ancestry from people mentioned in sagas at those farms , or from the guy it 's named after . 
  such as `` the king stayed at x farm with y person in the year 967 '' . 
  though gavelkind often split them up , only for them to merge again later . 
  we do n't really have castles :(, 
  norway , but since no swede has answered yet some might apply :  do people really leave their babies outside of cafes ? 
  if so why ? 
  are the cafes too small for strollers ? 
  or it because it is an adult only space ? 
  are there heaters outside of cafes for the babies so they do n't get too cold ? 
  it happens here too . 
  i rarely go to cafes , but we often leave them outside houses and such where it 's more quiet and cool . 
  especially when many people will be talking loudly . 
  cold is rarely a problem . 
  they have blankets . 
  i always slept on a sheep skin , in wool clothes . 
   where in sweden can you find lesser known places that have nice scenery ? 
  j\u00e4mtland has a lot of nice places . 
  but it 's kinda out of the way from most who are n't ski-tourists . 
  lots of forest and mountains . 
  it depends on what kind of scenery you want . 
  farmland ?
