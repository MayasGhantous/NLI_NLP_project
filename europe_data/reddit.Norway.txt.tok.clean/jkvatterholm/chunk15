  old buildings ? 
  mountains ? 
  no , we 'd probably think you were crazy if you did that here . 
  we mostly ate slices of bread for breakfast , lunch and supper . 
  but sometimes cereal as well . 
  usually [ oats with milk ] ( http://atrium.h.uib.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/havregryn.jpg ) and jam/banana . 
  or cornflakes with oats ( pure cornflakes was not allowed by my parents ) . 
  my siblings ate some [ chocolate ] ( http://www.rollut.no/prestashop/11000366-434-large/weetos-sjokolade-375g.jpg ) cereal thing often . 
  those sugary rice things are also common . 
  still mostly the same today , though i do n't eat breakfast that often . 
  kinda boring part . 
   `` article 112 if experience shows that any part of this constitution of the kingdom of norway ought to be amended , the proposal to this effect shall be submitted to the first , second or third storting after a new general election and be publicly announced in print . 
  but it shall be left to the first , second or third storting after the following general election to decide whether or not the proposed amendment shall be adopted . 
   such amendment must never , however , contradict the principles embodied in this constitution , but solely relate to modifications of particular provisions which do not alter the spirit of the constitution , and such amendment requires that two thirds of the storting agree thereto . 
   an amendment to the constitution adopted in the manner aforesaid shall be signed by the president and the secretary of the storting , and shall be sent to the king for public announcement in print as an applicable provision of the constitution of the kingdom of norway . '', 
  in norway there are tons of dialects , although not quite as far removed from each other as some dialects in sweden ( sk\u00e5ne-kalix ) . 
  but they are way more common to hear in the day to day life than in sweden . 
  none of them are truly impossible to understand for others , but they can be challenging if you 're unfamiliar with that area . 
  * [ setesdal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n02lzgz7guo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=92 ) . 
  quite conservative grammar in many ways . 
  also has many vowel changes that makes it hard . 
  * [ innherred ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8iwzznjtic&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=119 ) . 
  a bit conservative in some aspects , also a lot of innovative changes from old norwegian . 
  * [ nordfjord ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olkhcd1ccqw ) . 
  same as the two above . 
  and of course many more , smaller ones . 
  - gon na ignore icelandic sagas , as that 's iceland , and many modern books - assuming the content would be lost without them : * norsk grammatik ( 1864 ) by ivar aasen . 
  first grammar ever published about / all / the norwegian dialects since the old norse period . 
  a very important work . 
  * konungs skuggsj\u00e1 / speculum regale ( ca . 
  the biggest and most monumental of the old norse texts produced in norway . 
  a hand-book for a king , teaching him what 's worth knowing . 
  norwegian folk tales and fairyltales . 
  other strong candidates are the collection of norwegian ballads and the dictionary . 
  and then all the more modern literature , that i 'm less familiar with . 
  you have people such as snorri sturluson who wrote many medieval sagas . 
  that was in iceland mostly , but the language was the same back then so it applies . 
  many if them started as oral traditions , and has unknown authors . 
  others are adopted from mainland ballads under the rule of king sverri . 
  through the danish period we do n't have that much that are as famous . 
  in the late 19th century there are the `` 4 big ones '' . 
  [ bj\u00f8rnstjerne bj\u00f8rnson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bj%c3%b8rnstjerne_bj%c3%b8rnson ) , [ alexander kielland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_kielland ) , [ jonas lie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jonas_lie_\\ ( writer \\ ) ) og [ henrik ibsen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henrik_ibsen ) . 
  many also want to add writers such as [ amalie skram ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amalie_skram ) and such . 
  if you are looking for that particular period though , then maybe someone like [ peter dass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petter_dass ) or [ ludvig holberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ludvig_holberg ) , though they are much less known . 
  there is also [ draumkvede ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/draumkvedet ) which is a late medieval tale written down in the 19th century , preserved in rural communities . 
  it has strong catholic themes , and must have been made before the 1540 's . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avuup3smys4 ) . 
  that 's from old high german b\u016btil . 
  so does n't seem likely . 
  * rug = uncertain . 
  maybe related to rough and modern german rau ( `` rough '' ) ? 
  * rag = from old norse * r\u01ebgg * . 
  closest german word = ? 
  * mug = similar to north germanic `` mugge/mugga/mugg '' and low german `` mokke '' . 
  original language unknown . 
  * bag = from old norse * baggi * . 
  closest german word = ? 
  * peg = from proto-germanic * pig - , * pag - ( `` peg , stake '' ) . 
  same as low german pig , pigge . 
  it 's usually english who has reduced vowels in the end of words . 
  as a norwegian i do n't really have much experience with sub-national `` states '' . 
  they are mostly just seem like a administrative division thing . 
  no one really know much about internal differences in germany/usa/mexico and such . 
  the countries or `` land '' are n't that clear either . 
  basques and sami people have their own land/country . 
  at least in the norwegian language . 
  but then france is also a `` land '' or country . 
  or russia as a whole . 
  it seem to be both connected to nations and regions , as well as a synonym for sovereign state . 
  independent states are a bit easier . 
  nation states , federal states and everything . 
  the biggest unit more or less . 
  the basque country has no such state , while norway does . 
  it 's complicated . 
  easiest solution : split up sweden first !, 
  do you still speak the older dialect there ? 
  '' \u00c6 hus '' instead of `` huset '' and such ? 
  is n't poato in both danish and german `` kartoffel though ? 
  also that 's probably the worst example you could choose . 
  just look [ at norway ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lv4rwyl.png ) :p, 
  i meant that swedish has comparatively more french than danish has . 
  they both have a load of german , such as `` bliva '' , but you seem to have french instead many places . 
  this is not based on anything but what i 've personally seen ofc . 
  i do n't have any statistics to compare the two . 
  danish seems to have more similarities with german than swedish have . 
  in loanwords swedish tends to have a bit more french than danish has after what i see . 
  but danish is still closest to southern swedish and norwegian than other languages . 
  there would be a at least partial continuum , but it 's more or less extinct . 
  * german * ( other dialect ? ), 
  * low german * ( north frisian maybe ? ), 
  * south jutlandic * ( other dailect ? ), 
  * danish, 
  a grain-silo like this : http://g.api.no/obscura/api/dynamic/r1/ece5/tr_1080_716_l_f/0000/ring/2015/11/29/15/1448806701900.jpg?chk=5eec2f, 
  scanian + bornholm and a couple others shared by denmark and sweden are called `` east danish '' or `` south swedish '' dialects depending on who you ask . 
  they have a bunch of features in common with danish ( words , often `` bl\u00f8de '' konsonanter , the r and some gramatical stuff ) . 
  they also have a bunch of similar traits linking them with swedish dialects . 
  ( such as the pronoun `` jag ( jao ) '' and the infinite ending of verbs . 
  they also have various traits only some dialects have , that they have in common with only a few other dialects . 
  or are unique . 
  such as the belt of diphtongs going through the area .
