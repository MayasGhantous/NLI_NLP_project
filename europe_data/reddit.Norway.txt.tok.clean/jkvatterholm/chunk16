  not really anyone in norway . 
  we got some who are mostly jokes , such as helgeland/nordland ( north norway ) going independent again , which they have n't really been since norway was united . 
  contrary to popular belief there is n't really any saemie/sapmi independence thing going on . 
  many of them want more autonomy as a people , but independence would never work as much of the area have been shared by sami and norwegians for thousands of years , not belonging to only one group . 
  there are n't really much info about germanic religion . 
  even the texts about norse religion and questionable in ways , but at least we have them . 
  i 'm from norway , and while we probably have some wicca and whatever the most popular are probably the various norse-based groups . 
  everything from right wing extremist who does n't really know anything about the myths but just think they are cool , to the more common casual groups , to the `` seid and shamanistic magic is for women and also odin '' kinda groups . 
  * the biggest group i believe is \u00c5satrufellesskapet bifrost , which has a burial place in oslo , their own ceremonies and stuff , and can marry people ( heterosexual or homosexual ) . 
  it has many sub-groups . 
  been around since the 80 's , but really started in 1996 . 
  * `` foreningen forn sed '' is another group , that i know farily little about , but it seems quite similar . 
  * then you have various fringe `` odin-ist '' movements , that are in general viewed as more racist and violent , though they themselves might not agree . 
  i 'd like to join for fun , but i ca n't convince myself or others that i actually believe this stuff . 
  so i just keep it as a hobby , and keep some of the old folklore my grandmother taught me about elves and such alive . 
  support for the eu has gone down over the years , and i do n't see it changing any time soon . 
  i ca n't speak for the `` never '' part , but the `` yes '' side wo n't win another referendum for a long long time . 
  in norwegian and northern swedish the genitive is dead too ( except in telemark and around oslo where they use a posessive-s like english ) . 
  which has lead to some interesting constructions . 
  * `` peder sitt hus '' - from low german or dutch . 
  used in the west and north , getting common in the east as well . 
  * `` huset til / \u00e5t peder '' with a preposition ( `` to/at '' ) . 
  using dative when applicable . 
  * `` huset hans peder '' - using `` his '' . 
  common most places . 
  * `` huset manna '' - `` the house the man '' with `` man '' in dative . 
  common in northern sweden . 
  * `` peders hus '' - with a posessive s. 
  my dialect is `` innherredsm\u00e5l '' , which is a part of the inner tr\u00f8ndish dialects of norwegian . 
  grammar : - dative case !, 
  at least for people above 40 . 
  '' \u00c6g gav h\u00f8y \u00e5t hestom '' ( `` i gave hay at the horses '' ) for example . 
  where the horses are in the dative case . 
  same as german or icelandic for example . 
  also in pronouns and such . 
  phonology : - how some words have changed : old norse | me | standard | english -- | -- | -- | -- ek | \u00e6g | eg/jeg | i s\u00e6ngin | se\u00f1ja | senga | the bed m\u00fdsa | mussu | myse | whey hvat | ke | hva/kva | what noregr | norri | noreg/norge | norway sl\u00e1 | hl\u00e5 | sl\u00e5 | hit hvalp | kv\u00f8lp | kvalp/valp | whelp vera | v\u00e5rr\u00e5 | vera/vere | to be also ever adjective gets a gendered form based on what it is in relation to . 
  this is more or less how i sound : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i055kq2zksi, 
  i could see `` international english '' fossilise itself and remain as a lingua franca spoken natively by no one while american and british english drift apart . 
  kinda like latin or old arabic . 
  i 'm not saying we should invent more . 
  just help keep what we have of dialects and languages healthy . 
  i guess we should just remove small languages and dialects then ? 
  can you give me a single negative aspect with everyone speaking dialects ? 
  why not ? 
  diversity is always good , and feeling your mother tongue is less important than the `` standard '' language is n't healthy for a community . 
  luckily that is n't that much of a thing here as some places , as we are very good at preserving dialects and most speak their own one . 
  but go back 50 years and northern norwegians speaking their one was discriminated against . 
  and then you have minority languages like south sami getting almost no media or exposure to their language , having to use a norwegian dialect instead , threatening to kill their language . 
  speaking differently does n't split people up . 
  every valley has their own grammar , but it 's still norwegian . 
  and honestly if you think dialects are no good then you could make the same ( but more extreme ) case to remove a `` small '' language like lithuanian to make communication easier . 
   is it a second native language ? 
  a really well known foreign language ? 
  something in between ? 
  not a native language . 
  it comes easy to me , but i learned it through a whole lot of god damn memorising words in school , helped and improved tenfold by the internet . 
   would you ever want english to be official in your home country ? 
  it should not be an official language in norway . 
  i can see no reason for that . 
  i 'd rather increase the status of minority languages and dialects . 
   also , do you wish your mother language was more used , or that there was more media in it ? 
  norwegian is used a whole lot . 
  i mean , everyone speaks it and there are tons of media . 
  but more media in general could n't hurt i guess . 
  depends what you want . 
  the coast from nordm\u00f8re to ytternamdalen are all very pretty , but kinda far away from everything . 
  the land around the fjord is much more flat , but then i do love a nice `` kulturlandskap '' with open fields . 
  trondheim is worth a stop in any case , and if you are interested in that kind of thing or catholic then maybe stiklestad and various other historical places . 
  fishing and agriculture are the main points . 
  the poor state and depopulation of the swedish countryside currently also helps convince people . 
  eu is n't very friendly to medium-small farms . 
  it 's definitely a thing in rural norway , similar to sweden . 
  as i 'm norwegian i 'll try to argue for my region of north-tr\u00f8ndelag , and not western and northern norway and oslo that everyone wants to go to . 
  true , we are a bit flatter and have more forest and farmland than the amazing landscaped in the west and north . 
  but we still have a lot of pretty things and fun activities !,

  and much more !, 
  in norway the big majority do not want eu . 
  the conservatives and urban people are the main force driving us to join them , including the leadership of the labour party but not most members or voters . 
  they are the only reason we joined the eea and the various other eu institutions many people are against . 
  the elite wants us to join , something like 70 % of people do not . 
  with all kinds of bends and stuff . 
  you do n't see that back home , but they are everywhere once you cross the border . 
  as norway , counting food , language , architecture , and general way of life : 1 . 
  sweden .
