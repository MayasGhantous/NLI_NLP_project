  almost no difference when crossing the border , which is an hour away . 
  except that they have weird roofs . 
  and are way worse at keeping their countryside populated and healthy . 
  bread is n't as good . 
  denmark/iceland/faroe islands . 
  this one will depend on where in norway you live . 
  i do n't feel that much similarities with denmark . 
  it 's all flat and have weird houses !, 
  same with iceland in a way . 
  they all speak weird . 
  finland . 
  ca n't understand what most fins are saying , but their land / looks / pretty much like home . 
  finnish people seems kinda normal too . 
  no idea . 
  germany , britain , netherlands and baltics maybe ? 
  a few parts of russia ? 
  north america ? 
  depends what part of culture you look at i guess . 
  climate shapes a lot of it . 
   i 'm honestly not sure which sound \u00f6 represents . 
  however , there are several vocals ( more `` closed '' ones ? ), 
  that younger people , including me , do n't use . 
  i 'm not too sure either . 
  i think they have it down in sol\u00f8r . 
  it 's a more open \u00d8 , many use \u00c6 instead . 
  `` h\u00e6le i d\u00e6ra '' vs `` h\u00f6le i d\u00f6ra '' . 
   i 'm not sure if this has been part of the dialect where i live , but i know it is common further north . 
  i was quite unsure as well . 
  i ended up not including you on the final version of [ my map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gtgiody.png ) . 
  the `` easy '' comment was sarcasm . 
  i know and i still ca n't figure out how much anything is unless i have a few minutes !, 
  which dialect is that ? 
   ( for example , 97 is basically a slightly contracted version of `` seven-and-half-fifth '' , because reasons ) syv og halv-fem-s ( ind-s-tyve ) . 
  easy !, 
  thank you !, 
  yeah . 
  gon na be dead within a couple generations . 
  made a [ map of it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4tcvhkj.png ) a while ago . 
  norwegian is too diverse to say something like this about anything but the spelling , so i 'll do my dialect instead . 
  it seems very few people care to master the various older features of my dialect any more , and defaults to the the urban way of speaking . 
  i 'm aware that languages change , and i 'm not angry at people for not getting these things . 
  it 's totally understandable . 
  i just find it fun to point out !, 
  * no one under 40 uses the dative case correct any more . 
  they just throw it in kinda randomly where it might fit , part of the time . 
  it should be '' \u00e6g gav h\u00f8y \u00e5t * hestom * '' * overuse of `` d\u00e6m '' . 
  it should be `` d\u00e9 husa '' , not `` d\u00e6m husan '' . 
  * hen , den and der . 
  `` den '' should only be used for things within pointing distance , not the same as `` there '' in english . 
  then there is some sound changes . 
  * we have the vowels \u00f6 , \u00f8 and \u00e6 . \u00f6 and \u00e6 is not the same !, 
  there is a differenc between sj\u00e6l , sj\u00f8l and sj\u00f6l . 
  * and then the palatalisation of velars in the middle of words . 
  skog  skojen , v\u00e6gg  vedjen , v\u00e6g  vejn this one is doomed for extinction by my parent generation . 
  then sorry , but you 're occupied . 
  maybe man . 
  the weslh can keep \u01eangullsey though . 
  sounds a little bit different from this . 
  it 's not svalbard itself but the travel . 
  and [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w9lry6spjy ) an old swedish dialect from finland . 
  i hate how that video has become a famous example of my dialect . 
  he does n't actually use any weird words or grammar , he just speaks fast . 
  how is [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpn8s2xhbhy ) in a slower tempo sound ? 
  from right on the swedish border . 
   but i have a lot of friends from were i grew up ( southern sweden ) who find danish easier to understand than norwegian and i 've got friends from v\u00e4rmland who find norwegian easier to understand than than the scanian dialect of swedish . 
  i quite like the idea of a scandinavian dialect continuum , rather than individual languages , because in reality some dialects are more similar to another language than dialects of the same language . 
  exactly this !, 
  people in norrland and jamtland especially speak much more similar to me than people in southern norway and sweden do . 
   danish and norwegian are considered separate yet are almost entirely mutually intelligible . 
  yet me a doric speaking aberdonian when having a phone conversation with a a very scouse sounding lady it took us about a minute and several repetitions for us to parse each other sentences . 
  i think that 's just depending on how used you are to dialects . 
  many danish and norwegian dialects are not very close at all . . 
  i can not understand some of the danish ones . 
  my cousin could not understand any danish . 
  you 're reading to much into it . 
  these tourists i think about probably have no idea what svalbard is . 
  they just assume we 're a land of ice and snow and polar bears . 
  also tourists to svalbard need a visum , as it 's not part of schengen . 
  norwegian citizens are allowed with a simple id . 
  and gibraltar is the only place in europe with monkeys . 
  salvbard has a population of 2600 . 
  500 of them russians . 
  as well the access there is quite limited as you need a visum and stuff . 
  it is a beautiful place , but it 's a bit like going to england and expect to see the monkeys from gibraltar since they are both parts of the united kingdom . 
  england has no monekys , the uk does . 
  norway has no polar bears , the kingdom of norway does . 
  give jamtland/herjedalen/idre / bohuslen/faroe islands/orkney/iceland back !, 
  fun fact : * `` the north pole '' * and * `` north poland '' * is the same in norwegian . 
  that 's a bit like going to england and expect to see the gibraltar monkeys though . 
  who cares about svalbard though ? 
  i 'm more of a medieval guy myself . 
  maybe vendel period . 
  let 's keep away from politics , and rather talk about the weirdest things i repeatedly hear * some * tourists think of norway . 
  * there are polar bears here . 
  * the `` midnight sun '' is a different sun that you can only see up here . 
  yes . 
  someone actually thought so . 
  * no you ca n't take a two day trip to the other end of the country . 
  * we have more history than the viking age you know . 
  we have burial mounds from the bronze age and medieval buildings still standing .
