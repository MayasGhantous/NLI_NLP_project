  no , they are n't pagan . 
  in norway everyone * must * have a name and one or a double surname . 
  middle name is optional . 
  * a double surname must be connected with a line . 
  * johnson-smith * . 
  * you can not choose last names which fewer than 200 persons already have unless you get their permission or have a reason . 
  ( like if you want to be named `` redfarm '' and live on `` red farm '' ) * you can not use a registered surname as a personal name . 
  * you can not use surnames as personal names . 
  ( except foreign names ) * any name you can use as surname can be used as middle name . 
  * various rules to allow you to take surnames of relatives , forefathers or areas . 
  * only the norwegian alphabet is accepted . 
  latin with the adition of \u00c6\u00d8\u00c5 . 
  a swede named `` f\u00e4n '' or whatever would be registered as fan or f\u00e6n or whatever in the system , but may sign as something else . 
  this also applies to other official languages in norway , such as sami . 
  though they have more letters . 
  now , these naming rules was what killed living patronymics like `` olavson '' in norway . 
  everyone had to have a last name , and such the patronymic was frozen as a surname . 
  if you want a patronymic today , the easiest solution is to add it as a middle name , as those are freer and not as important as surnames . 
  you ca n't stop my mead brewing that easily . 
  yeah . 
  the parts where norn was spoken until recently . 
  former parts of norway . 
  central norway , home region . 
  bordering regions in norway and sweden . 
  the rest of norway and most of sweden . 
  denmark , iceland , swedish speaking finland , sk\u00e5ne , such places . 
  northern europe in general maybe ? 
  all of finland , estonia , parts of germany and uk . 
  germany , uk , ireland , benelux . 
  maybe squeeze in some parts of russia like murmansk . 
  further away but kinda similar places like portugal , greece , russia and stuff . 
  maybe america . 
   do you believe in one or more god ( s ) ? 
   are you a member of a religious society ? 
  ( church of england , folkekirken , etc. ), 
   do you ever say a prayer , meditate , etc ? 
  i sometimes small minor offerings to `` farm elves '' and gods , just for fun . 
  tradition mostly . 
   whether or not you go to a church/mosque/temple etc. 
  or not , do you perceive yourself as ... 
  confident atheist, 
  i do not feel much of any `` european '' identity . 
  a nordic identity maybe , but i am norwegian , and i do n't feel any closer to greece or belarus than to america or something . 
  the further i move away from home the more different things become after all . 
  i 'd feel foreign long before i reach the bosporus . 
  in fact i feel closer to some regions of sweden than to some further away regions of norway . 
  been talking to my grandparents on how they grew up in the 50 's and early 60 's eating mostly salted fish , potatoes and porridge from barley , though the diet was changing to a more modern one . 
  kinda curious which staples would be common around other places in europe back then . 
  what i have gathered from my area : * ** salted fish . 
  ** mostly herring or cod . 
  more salt than fish after a few months according to my grandfather . 
  * ** potatoes ** . 
  boiled mostly , or used in bread . 
  * ** barley porridge ** . 
  made with water or milk . 
  butter common topping . 
  often roasted in a pan the day after for breakfast . 
  sliced or [ flat ] ( https://images.food52.com/6d4406u4b74eickpksg7_zuetda=/fit-in/1200x1200/23100b51-6609-4004-8698-ba6669e41fb7--lefse_bfast_2.jpg ) . 
  what and rye were getting more common for `` proper '' bread . 
  many toppings were rare , especially meat . 
  butter , fish , syrup or granulated sugar were common , as they were kind cheap . 
  * ** [ dumplings ] ( http://www.haaland-kjott.no/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/komle350.jpg ) ** . 
  mostly from barley and potatoes . 
  [ sometimes wheat ] ( https://martesmatogslikt.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image.jpg ) . 
  often bacon , salt meat or fish inside . 
  served along potatoes to fish , meat or whey-sauce . 
  sometimes boiled in milk and served with something sweet . 
  * ** other roots ** . 
  carrots , '' [ rutabaga ] ( http://www.bama.no/lisesblogg/img/1036x486/kaalrot.jpg ) '' and turnip . 
  often mashed . 
  it 's still popular to pick turnips and eat as if they were apples . 
  at least around here . 
  vegetables in general were n't common except those , cabbage and peas . 
  * ** milk products ** like [ m\u00f8ssm\u00f8r ] ( http://www.melk.no/sitefiles/site6/files/artimg/prim38.jpg ) , cheese and '' [ skyr-cheese ] ( https://itaktmednaturen.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/okologisk_skjorost_fra_rorosmeieriet_web_foto_geir_foden.jpg?w=450&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1 ) '' were common . 
  from cowmilk and goatmilk . 
  how would people in your area eat back in the day ? 
  we always started whenever we got home from school , and usually had it ready for when my parents got back . 
  so around 15-16 .00 . 
  if it was a nice dinner we could do it a bit later , like around six or seven . 
  then we 'd eat supper later . 
  usually cereal or some bread . 
  norwegian for dinner is `` middag '' after all . 
  literally `` mid-day '' . 
  back in the day it was eaten at 12 and was the only hot meal of the day , and the separate meal at around 15.00 was called `` non '' , same as english `` noon '' . 
  for me it was the local dialect of norwegian , and then all the other norwegian dialects of people who moved here . 
  a teacher or two from another part of norway for example . 
  you can tell who 's a local and not by the way they speak , and where they come from , even if they 're only from a few kilometres higher up in the valley . 
  then the swedish border is an hour away , so you get the dialect from that swedish region , as well as standard swedish . 
  english was taught , but no one used it . 
  maybe except with some foreigners . 
  other foreign languages probably were used , but i never heard much of it . 
  maybe some polish . 
  there were a number of polish workers there . 
  south sami exist in the area , but they are so few that it 's not really heard . 
  sadly a dying language . 
  same with scandoromani . 
  probably just a handful of speakers of either , if that . 
  i live in rural norway , so it 's very common . 
  every farm almost own a gun , and elk ( moose ) is shot within 500 meters of my house almost every year . 
  smaller animals like mountain birds are also hunted a lot .
