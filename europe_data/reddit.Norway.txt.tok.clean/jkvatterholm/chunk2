  if they could only get it done already . 
  all of these seem to stop somewhere around letters j-t . http://kaino.kotus.fi/fo/?p=article&amp;word=bir&amp;fo_id=fo_097aa81a695442a142032ae8b24b6ce1,

  and you have the archaic word `` bir '' that 's a cognate of german and english and comes from old norse `` bjor '' . 
  it should be nagu . 
  it 's a swedish dialect . 
  it should be nagu . 
  it 's a swedish dialect , preserving the old norse `` bjor '' in the form of swedish `` bir '' . 
  i made the map . 
  yeah . 
  it 's just `` possibly '' from an turkic language , due to the similarities with kazakh and such . 
  i made this map . 
  nice to see it 's popular !, 
  that 's what i found when searching the depths of swedish dialectal dictionaries . 
  the standard swedish form would be `` bir '' . 
  i added it anyway to show the relationship . 
  i was a bit unsure about how exactly it was used , and if it varied by dialect . 
  that 's what the etymology section stated when i looked it up . 
  not exactly detailed but the only thing i had to go by . 
   possibly from a turkic language . 
  in old norse it would be / \u0254\u02d0l / . 
  same vowel as many english speakers have in `` not '' or `` thought '' . 
  in old norse it would be / \u0254\u02d0l / . 
  same vowel as many english speakers have in `` not '' or `` thought '' . 
  thank you !, 
  they are both swedish dialect that use either imported from german or remains of old norse bjor . 
  it 's a swedish dialect . 
  simialr to the spot in southern sweden . 
  i made the map . 
  in norway and sweden it was rural people , left-leaning people and industrial workers . 
  you make it sound like a negative thing . 
  no worries . 
  it just seems like one of those `` sami people live in the north of scandinavia , right ? 
  let 's just split it north/south . '', 
  maps . 
  why is lofoten different than the rest of nothern norway ? 
  seems like one of those maps where the lines are drawn at random . 
  seems the map could be quite different if i chose to show nn  dn/nnj instead of ll  dl/llj . 
  maybe i could do that in the future . 
  do you speak jamsk ? 
   what 's the exact pronounciation in tr\u00f8ndelag ? 
  is it really a falling ao and not a rising diphthong ( like in faroese ) ? 
  `` baot me ' aora '' is the most common sentence to demonstrate it . 
  `` ao '' seems like the best way in the south , while the north of the area has '' \u00e5o '' . 
  similar tone as we say `` au '' . 
  not quite sure how i 'd write it in ipa though . 
  i do n't have it myself . 
  also \u00e9 has become `` je '' in some of the area , similar to iceland . 
   btw , do n't parts of norrbotten ( \u00d6verkalix etc. ), 
  that might be , but i have not seen any into on that . 
   worth mentioning is that j\u00e4mtland most likely once had palatalized ll and nn , proven by the fact that a in front of nn are fronted : hann  h\u00e4nn , land  l\u00e4nn etc. 
  that makes j\u00e4mtland a `` remains of ... '' area ? 
  maybe . 
  map is of ll though . 
  do they say `` b\u00e6ll '' and `` k\u00e6ll '' for ball/karl ? 
  they have something similar in lierne . 
  there it is , if i remember right , `` l\u00e6nn '' and `` m\u00e6nn '' , but `` pi\u00f1\u00f1 ' '' . 
  but i 'm not saying it 's west norse . 
  just present in that area among the other changes . 
  also the area in jamtland likely could get it from tr\u00f8ndelag in norway , which had more of it earlier . 
  but true about the other areas . 
  i made a map if it a few months ago : [ \u00e1  ao ] ( http://i.imgur.com/euiyacf.png ) [ ll  dl ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o2oasnz.png ) ( nn  dn has a bit wider range , including hallingdal . ), 
  the diphtongs most likely are later developments . 
  happening many places . 
  namdal got only \u00e1  ao while setesdal got [ almost everyone ] ( http://www.vallemal.no/frames.jsp?menu=2 ) but \u00e1  ao . 
  no , nothern norwegian is n't particularly close . 
  hardanger-inner sogn dialect in the west should be the closest . 
  they share the development from norse ll  dl , nn  dn and \u00e1  ao with icelandic . 
  as well as being a bit archaic ( though not as much as some other ones ) . 
  not sure too sure , but hardanger might have inherited the dual form instead of the plural form of personal pronouns as well . 
  vit-okkar instead of v\u00e9r-oss . 
  one did not branch off from the other . 
  they split . 
  sounded more understandable than normal german to my norwegian ears . 
  i 'm not saying every little `` husmansplass '' split out from the main farm in the 19th century need to survive , or other minor farms like [ this on ] ( http://nubdalseng.net/img/big/fjordblick_big.jpg ) . 
  that hope is already gone . 
  but normal farms are also having a hard time , somewhat depending on the current government . 
  [ like these ones . ] ( http://verdalsbilder.no/cpg1410/albums/userpics/10023/sulbygda_2400_05112011.jpg ) . 
  the first mentions of them are from 1030 , and they have been important ferry points across the mountain long since then . 
  if such farms go away the result is that food production droppa , and we 're only at about 40 % sustainability in norway . 
  will farms be limited to superfarms in tr\u00f8ndelag , j\u00e6ren and hedmarken in the future ? 
  the nation would not look similar at all , the tourit industry would suffer . 
  some think that 's fine , and we should just import and trade for oil . 
  i do not agree with that at all . 
  we need a secure food source . 
  in each of the last wars people starved , especially in 1814 , when we already were depended on imports , but they could n't come because of a blockade . 
  we ca n't just ignore food production or leave it to some far away country and focus on oil and services . 
  farming is more than just any other industry . 
  it does n't just create jobs and money . 
  it shapes the landscape and creates work where no other work exists . 
  i wanted to include it , but i could not find any info . 
  hard to search for when you do n't speak finnish .
