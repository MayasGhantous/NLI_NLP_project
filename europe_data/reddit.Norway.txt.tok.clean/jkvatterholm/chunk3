  ( christians/conservatives ) * nature conservation groups . 
  * fishing and farming organisations . 
   the main themes of the `` no '' campaign were loss of sovereignty if norway should join the union , as well as the fundamental differences in economic structure between norway and the eu , as norway has an economy based heavily on natural resources ( especially oil and fish ) , in contrast to the eu 's more industrial economy . 
  the problems with communities getting ruined is still there though . 
  you ca n't have such big farms in norway . 
  they wo n't spend half the day driving between the small patches of land , who 's scattered through the valleys . 
  and thus no one would live there . 
  they also have a tendency to overuse fertilizers and antibiotics and similar . 
  less overview of the situation on the farms . 
  which also lowers the welfare for the animals ( according to farmers ) . 
  at least that 's the view here . 
  norway already has a very low use of antibiotics and such , but the need for it would increase with more animals for example . 
  this really depends on what you 'd call big and small farms though . 
  i 'm not saying small farms are nessesarily good . 
  but big factory farms are n't exacrly good either , not for the animals and not for the community around the farms . 
  there should be a balance . 
  the problem is that many places you ca n't merge farms if they are `` too smal '' . 
  they just move away from them and let them get overgrown . 
  most places in norway simply can not have big enough farms to compete with the mainland . 
  because we try to limit it . 
  and it has worked better than sweden 's policies . 
  you cross the border and there is barely anything there . 
  only old houses and abandoned or overgrown fields . 
  taking care of the cultural and historical landscapes are important . 
  yep . 
  farming communities further from the population centres are loosing people . 
  i live in the countryside , and farming was really the big thing here . 
  small farms have been selling out even without joining , and whole communities are hurt by it . 
  [ just look at this map . 
  in norway the countryside is generally more left-leaning while the cities are liberals . 
  [ left is red , conservatives are blue . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/comparison_results_by_municipality_norwegian_parliamentary_election_2009.svg ), 
  average farms luxembourg : = 60 hectares . 
   the average holding size increased from 46.5 hectares per farm in 2000 to 59.6 in average farms norway : = 17 hectares . 
  yep, 
  mostly that farmers and fishers , and by extension most rural people did not/do not like the eu 's relevant policies . 
  also the countryside tend to be a more left-leaning , and those parties did not support the eu either . 
  that 's a very simplified answer though . 
  more or less the same as norwegian and danish . 
  i think you mean 1658 :p, 
  some historians ( not sure how serious it is ) calls it for the tr\u00f8ndish genocide , since the swedes forcefully enlisted the majority of the men , sending them east to never return . 
  that mixed with losses in the wars and a failed harvest reduced the population greatly compared to other regions of norway . 
  no idea, 
  we 're still not bound by the [ agriculture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_agricultural_policy ) or [ fishing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_fisheries_policy ) policies though . 
  they are switched [ in the map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r3lsco6.png ) i posted on / r/mapporn . 
  no reason really , just that i made this based on an earlier map which had light blue as the extreme and did n't think about it . 
  joining would be bad for out agriculture and fishing , and in turn most of the communities around norway . 
  as you can see it is cities and right wing places that are most for it , while more left wing and rural areas are against it . 
  this is also the main reasons the faroe islands and iceland has kept outside . 
  we still are eurosceptic . 
  at least in norway , and most northern swedes i know . 
  i could not seem to find that they ever had a referendum about joining . 
  why is that ? 
  you 're right . 
  i had to colour in by hand and seems i removed the national border and left a county border in its place . 
  this is the most detailed statistics i were able to find . 
  for some nations that means municipalities , for others only counties . 
  i took a few days to find the data in any case !, 
  malta and greenland also had referendums , but i forgot . 
  those were 53,6 % yes in malta vs 46,98 % in greenland . 
  some places like austria the dark blue counties are almost always 69,5 or something . 
  almost feel bad not marking them light blue . 
  edit : here 's [ an alternative version with `` fixed '' colours and belgium ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r3lsco6.png ) . 
   no one says english is romance , a good part of the vocabulary is romance but the syntax and common words are germanic i 've met people who claim it is . 
  it is ofc . 
  just based on loanwords and spelling . 
  at half those latin words would also be used in languages like norwegian as well , and no one claims we 're romance . 
  germansk , vokabular , majoritet etc. 
  not too late to get one !, 
  even in norway they were `` extinct '' most places , only getting back into use after 1850 . 
  at some places they based them on old pictures and such , while in other places like my region it is kinda fantasy . 
  in the old norwegian calendar it could be covered by the months torre and gj\u00f8 / go . 
  some use the name `` gj\u00f8 '' for the entire month , but this is rare nowadays . 
  `` marsi '' or `` massi '' is also a common variant of the name . 
  you at least put it on the potaties though , right ? 
  how could you eat any meatballs/kj \u00f8ttkake without sauce ? 
  it 's awesome !, 
  it 's mashed potatoes . 
  you need that nice fried outer layer though !, 
  as others have said the danish/swedish/norwegian - s ending does n't really count . 
  similar to how it does n't count as a proper case in english . 
   in parts of central and northern scandinavia ( both sweden and norway ) we dialectally still use four ( 4 ) cases ( like in icelandic and old norse ) : nominative , accusative , dative and genitive but only 2 of them ( nom/dative ) are regularly marked outisde pronouns . 
  indeed . 
  genitive is more or less dead everywhere but iceland , unless you count the swedish/danish - s ending . 
  but that 's not really a case . 
  there is a difference between keeping some mild sound traits like uvular r or such and speeking what you sometimes call `` genuina folkm\u00e5l '' though . 
  most genuine dialects are threatened . 
  the grammar for example . 
  the situation has improved , but it 's still going to wrong way . 
  same in norway kinda , but here you do n't change to a standard norwegian , but a watered down regional dialect . 
  maybe . 
  but it applies to everyone . 
  just people i hear talking on the street and such . 
  i mean that when i go to sweden i mostly see people speaking standard swedish or close to it in the bigger towns ( jamtland-dalarna ) . 
  the genuine dialects are more or less gone many places . 
  how many people in northern halland still says `` ick/eck '' for `` jag '' nowadays ? 
  i 've seen that the retroflex sounds can be confusing , and that western and southern norwegian is easier than the inland-east . 
  here 's a transcription of them speaking `` the norhtern wind and the sun . . '' * standard swedish : [ \u02c8nu\u02d0\u0256a\u0271\u02ccv\u026an\u02d0d\u0259n \u0254 \u02c8su\u02d0l\u0259n ] * oslo norwegian : [ nu\u02d0\u027e\u0251\u02cc\u028bin\u02c8n\u0329 \u0254 \u02c8su\u02d0ln\u0329 ] * hardanger norwegian : [ nu\u02d0\u0270\u0251\u028bindn\u0329 \u0254 \u02c8su\u02d0l\u025b ] * tr\u00f8nder norwegian : [ nu\u02d0\u027d\u0251\u02cc\u028bi\u0272\u02c8 \u0254 \u02c8su\u02d0\u027d\u0251 ] could n't find any danish !, 
  exactly . 
  dialects are often more similar to those just across the border than those further away .
