  denmark and sweden also has a lot of dialectal variation . 
  sweden may have even bigger differences , but they are less commonly used compared to norway . 
  germanic is the family , split into north ( scandinavian ) , west and east germanic . 
  english and german are western , not northern germanic . 
  biskop from english , from greek . 
  the origin of `` finn '' is debated though . 
   it has been suggested that this non-uralic ethnonym is of germanic language origin and related to such words as finthan ( old high german ) ` find ' , ` notice ' ; fanthian ( old high german ) ` check ' , ` try ' ; and fendo ( old high german ) and vende ( old middle german ) ` pedestrian ' , ` wanderer ' . 
  [ 28 ] another etymological interpretation associates this ethnonym with fen in a more toponymical approach . 
  yet another theory postulates that the words finn and kven are cognates . 
  op probably went with the last one . 
   still in use in parts of northern norway central norway as well . 
  that 's not sweden . 
  that seems to be various sami groups/tribes/clans whatever 's the best word . 
  it is way more accurate that i expected , but has some quite big errors and weird things in some other regards . 
  * the names range from historical ones , to modern ones instead of old ones , to fantasy ones like `` fjordland '' for fjordane . 
  * why is my region independent 1030-40 ? 
  innherred was not independent back then . 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'd know . 
  * leaves a lot of gaps for areas and times we know little about . 
  hard to fix though . 
  * how they got info about the sami divisions back in the 12th century i have no idea . 
  * why is akershus shown as different than the rest of norway ? 
  i 'm kinda sceptical about the decline . 
  there probably were many people and farms there , just less noticable and rich . 
  if they were there already before the viking age , how could they expand there there in the 9th century ? 
  king olaf raided in finland . 
   after this they sailed to finland and plundered there , and went up the country . 
  all the people fled to the forest , and they had emptied their houses of all household goods . 
  the king went far up the country , ... however , they made but small booty , and saw no people ; and as it was getting late in the day , the king turned back to his ships . 
  now when they came into the woods again people rushed upon them from all quarters , and made a severe attack . 
  the king told his men to cover themselves with their shields , but before they got out of the woods he lost many people , and many were wounded ; but at last , late in the evening , he got to the ships . 
  the finlanders conjured up in the night , by their witchcraft , a dreadful storm and bad weather on the sea ; but the king ordered the anchors to be weighed and sail hoisted , and beat off all night to the outside of the land . 
  the king 's luck prevailed more than the finlanders ' witchcraft ; for he had the luck to beat round the balagard 's side in the night . 
  and so got out to sea . 
  but the finnish army proceeded on land , making the same progress as the king made with his ships . 
  there were certainly an agricultural population there before then , around the central lakes . 
  they have burial mounds and hill forts older than that . 
  it is kinda debated how old norse sounded in that regard . 
  it may have had the pitched accent at least , since danish used to have it but most ( but not all ) dialects have lost it . 
  so have some norwegian and swedish dialects . 
  and icelandic ofc . 
  the expansion in inland and northern scandinavia is bullshit . 
  the population pattern in norway stayed more or less the same through the period , reaching north to troms . 
  best of luck !, 
  break free from the evil danes like we and iceland did !, 
  ^ ^ then ^ ^ join ^ ^ us . 
  the faroe islands are not . 
   as explicitly asserted by both treaties of the european union , the faroe islands are not part of the european union . 
  the faroes are not grouped with the eu when it comes to international trade ; for instance , when the eu and russia imposed reciprocal trade sanctions on each other over the war in donbass in 2014 , the faroes began exporting significant amounts of fresh salmon to russia . 
  not if we get there first !, 
   these soils are not suited for grain crop production without important inputs of conservation management . 
  in fact , no grain production must be contemplated in the absence of a good conservation plan . 
  lack of plant nutrients is a major constraint . 
  soil degradation must be continuously monitored . 
  productivity is not high . 
  risk for sustainable grain crop production is 40-60 % . 
  it is probably the lack of detail , but this does n't sound right at all for lowland central norway . 
  we produce tons of grain , and have for some thousand years . 
  why does it say we have to take such care not to mismanage when we are in the highest category of resiliance ? 
  luxembourg has natural resources ? 
  countries can be on multiple continents though . 
  siberia is n't europe just because most russians live in europe . 
  it just complicates things to call greenland europe . 
  would n't that make places like french guiana part of europe too ? . . 
  so kinda both ? 
  * in * the * end * of the sausage . 
  tons . 
  i say `` sy '' , and there 's su ( d ) , sy ( d ) , sye , s\u00f8 , syr . 
  germanic * big difference . 
  an estimated 20-40 % of the bokm\u00e5l-norwegian dictionary comes from low german . 
  less if you use the much bigger 2014 nynorsk dictionary . 
  do n't forget herjedalen , idre and s\u00e6rna !, 
  how it works in norway at least , i imagine it is roughly similar in the baltics : iron age : 500bc - 1030 ad . 
  middle ages : 1030-1537 smaller units : * stone age -- 1800 bc * bronze age 1800 -- 500 bc * early iron age 500bc - 500 ad . 
  * merovingian time 500 - 793 * viking era 793 - 1030 * early middle ages 1030 -- 1130 * civil war 1130 -- 1240 * high/late middle ages 1130 -- 1537 * refomation/absolute monarchy 1537 -- 1660 * absolute monarchy/kiel peace 1660 -- 1814, 
  we depended somewhat on grain from denmark , so the blockade hit us hard . 
  bark bread and such became a staple , and the blockade created unemployment and starvation . 
  there are famous tales of people rowing small boats over to denmark to try to get grain . 
  i know some maoists who 'd probably vote her if it meant the eu might crumble . 
  but then they would not vote in the first place . 
   i 'd like to meet the people who first went macron and switch to le pen a lot of left leaning people dislike the eu . 
  i know some maoists who might have voted for her just to make the union crumble . 
  but then my experience is from norway . 
  it 's not really that common where i 'm from . 
  we use `` t\u00f8ff / t\u00f8ft '' the same way . 
  which is also loaned from english . 
  we must reform it a bit then . 
  with influence from old norwegian . 
  more fair for us !, 
  with long vowel marking being optional , ofc . 
  apparently it 's from a news article about a store doing so illegally :p, 
  [ on sale . 
  it 's still better though . 
  that 's why `` vorspiel '' and `` nachspiel '' is so common . 
  basically drinking a bit at home , before and after going to the bar , to save money . 
  unless i am mistaken and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9ztwtfobpu ) or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eze_6zfiw8k ) is n't actually elfdalian , then this is quite easy . 
  they share some of the features with us . 
  like dative , and some sound changes . 
  people speaking standard swedish wo n't understand them maybe , but i am sure some other dialects would . 
  many places 0,5 liters of beer costs 100kr/10 ,5 $ / 11,6 $ or more .
