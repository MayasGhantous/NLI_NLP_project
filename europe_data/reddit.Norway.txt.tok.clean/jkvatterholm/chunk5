  the best price you can hope for is half that . 
  so it can get expensive quite quick . 
  it 's also the reason many ( where i 'm from at least ) start out getting drunk with moonshine instead of beer before they turn 18 . 
  ** spoken ** : any swedish and most danish . 
  single sentences and many words of faroese , and a bit of icelandic , but not as much . 
  more unique dialects like gutnish , elfdalian , orsam\u00e5l etc. 
  are also fairly easy for my region . 
  maybe not sk\u00e5ne . 
  ** written ** : any swedish or danish . 
  a lot of faroese and some words and sentences of icelandic . 
  some words of german and dutch , if they speak slow . 
  mostly due to loanwords . 
  but what about jamtland , idre/s \u00e6rna and bohuslen ? 
  norwegians use around 11 % of our pay on food . 
  much less than previous years . 
  the food is somewhat expensive , but then we also get high pay . 
  going to sweden or denmark for alcohol and bacon used to be quite common , but the prices there are n't that favourable right now . 
  protectionism and taxes on imports are meant to help us use local products when possible . 
  eating out is not that common , and when it happens it is mostly a social event with friends or family . 
  that 's also reflected in the price . 
  my family did it less than once per week . 
  maybe every second week . 
  but there might be variations . 
  well , it is the one `` dialect '' with the most users , and it seems to be used far outside oslo nowadays . 
  more or less the same anyway . 
  i know people from both \u00d8stfold and hamar that speaks almost exactly like those in oslo . 
  the trondheim dialect is spreading similarly in tr\u00f8ndelag . 
  i was kinda late , so only got drunk around 17 or 18 . 
  the old tradition here is to allow it after your confirmation , so around 16 . 
  but many start at 14 and 15 . 
  this is complicated in norwegian . 
  there are two + written norms of the language , but not true spoken norm . 
  * nynorsk was compiled by taking the common least danish traits in dialects and mixing them together . 
  in grammar it is close to most of central , eastern and western norwegian , but in the * looks * it is most similar to eastern dialects in western opplanda and telemark , and certain western dialects , due to not having the endings reduced a lot . 
  * bokm\u00e5l descends from danish . 
  around 1900 there were many changes to it , to make it closer to how posh people in towns like oslo and bergen and trondheim spoke . 
  later in that century more reforms came to make it more similar to norwegian in general , though most similar to dialects around oslo , who also became more and more similar to it . 
  * spoken norwegian is not supposed to have a standard , but various patterns have emerged . 
  spoken bokm\u00e5l and nynorsk are read with many dialectal traits like retroflexes intact . 
  a mix between he old posh speak in oslo and the oslo dialect have emerged , and become one of the most common ways to speak . 
  it is usually what immigrants learn , for example . 
  and how many think `` spoken bokm\u00e5l '' sounds . 
  regional `` close to the written language '' dialects in for example trondheim are getting rare . 
  * [ moster gamle kirke ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/moster_gamle_kirke_b%c3%b8mlo_h.jpg ) or [ v\u00e6rnes kirke ] ( http://kunsthistorie.com/w/images/9/97/2009_03_16_trondheim%2cskatval%2c_m%c3%a6re%2c_v%c3%a6rnes_3169711.jpg ) might be the oldest stone church . 
  from the 1100 's , with a tradition going back a few hundred years . 
  * [ urnes stave church ] ( https://www.fortidsminneforeningen.no/media/zoo/images/urnes-02-2002-07-24-134444-foto-jorgen-kirsebom.jpg_d72a40146127828e02952acdae9342cb.jpg ) is the oldest wooden church . 
  built around 1140 . 
  * [ vindlausloftet ] ( https://www.telemark.no/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/kulturminner/maanedens-kulturminne/vindlausloftet/67778-1-nor-no/vindlausloftet_responsive_12.jpg ) is the oldest non-church . 
  from just after 1167 . 
  there are tons of other churches from the 1100 's , but wooden buildings from that age are n't that common for obvious reasons . 
  after 1600 we have way more preserved . 
  some of the oldest from northern norway : [ stabbur , 1528 ] ( https://gfx.nrk.no/ifa03qki-mrcfwrsiwmluqkkq8nq1-7qi_oncndw6mhw ) . 
  all of this not counting ruins and unusable buildings . 
  yes , to a degree . 
  most high schools have multiple `` routes '' . 
  you start in year 11 in a path you have chosen . 
  there is : * preparation for study . 
  languages , geography , etc. 
  prepare for university . 
  * sports . 
  almost the same as above , but with extra gymnastics and related theory . 
  * music dance and drama . 
  see above . 
  * land management ( farming ) * building and etc. 
  * restaurant and food . 
  * designs and crafts . 
  * electrics . 
  * service and infrastructure . 
  * technic and industrial production . 
  my school had many of these , but not ones like electrics , farming and music . 
  you would have to go to the neighbour municipality for those . 
  i tried changing it , but nothing happened . 
  this time it seems to have though . 
  weird . 
  i do n't care . 
  it only bothers me when people start associating him with the actual god , or imagine the god to be anything like the comic one . 
  edit : can anyone explain why my norway flair does n't work ? 
  been to turkey , and across the continental plate in iceland . 
  it 's quite common to have visited places like turkey and canary islands . 
  further away is less common . 
  usually thailand or new york based on people i know . 
  i have many friends who have never left scandinavia . 
  surstr\u00f6mming was way worse than h\u00e1karl imo . 
  tons of them . 
  all songs are by definition sung in a dialect , though many of them are pronounced pretty close to a oslo-bokm\u00e5l . 
  * pr\u00f8ysen is one of the ones who everyone knows . 
  [ most of his songs are in dialect , and often famous . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmciqmjvolq ) * [ this guy is popular and have a few very well known songs . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yajy2medlsw ) * [ this song 's famous . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpudmy6esx0 ) * i * think * [ this christmas song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-xfm_o7iu4 ) from my area is famous . 
  that 's weird . 
  it worked a while ago . 
  norway . 
  you start english in school almost at once nowadays . 
  usually starting seriously in second or third grade . 
  how i dreaded getting 10 words to learn between each class . 
  memorising them was hard enough , but learning to spell them even worse . 
  and the grammar !, 
  most people my age and younger learned most through games . 
  i learned it through runescape .
