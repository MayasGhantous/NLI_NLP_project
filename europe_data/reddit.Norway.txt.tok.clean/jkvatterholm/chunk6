  you continue with english until somewhere around high school depending on your choice of education . 
  so most people are familiar enough with it . 
  there 's also a lot of english media , and no dubbing for adults ( also true for german and such ) . 
  in norwegian `` mem '' , pronounced with an e like in `` america '' . 
  in an internet context many adopt the english pronunciation and say `` mim '' or `` meme '' or something . 
  in our second ( the old ) bathroom , along with a dryer , toilet and sink . 
  seems quite common . 
  many have an utility room or have it in the cellar as well . 
  not the main bathroom though . 
  you could argue that iceland is half in america . 
  and that icelandic and norwegian are just dialects of ( old ) norwegian . 
  but . . yeah . 
  well yeah . 
  norwegian had n't been `` invented '' yet . 
  anything not protestant . 
  other churches was n't allowed , and jews were banned until 1851 , monks until 1897 , and jesuits until 1956 . 
  in the early 20th century many smaller christian `` independent '' churches became popular , but everything else is post-1970 . 
  weird . 
  the app shows country signs for me . 
  maybe a different one . 
  no , it 's norwegian !, 
  like i said , you call ugly ( which is `` ful '' in swedish ) angry !, 
  ( `` ful '' in my language ), 
  yeah . 
  it has plenty of meanings . 
  indh . 
  hard . 
  od , os , b\u00f8l ) . 
  yes , and i say `` ful '' for angry . 
  `` han var ful p\u00e5 meg '' = `` he was angry with me '' . 
  like a weird dialect . 
  some mix of eastern and western norwegian . 
  when i was a kid it was the false friends that always confused me . 
  you call ice cream `` glass '' and `` angry '' means `` ugly '' !, 
  i think he 's be reasonably popular in rural norway where i 'm from at least . 
  are n't you norwegian ? 
  surely you know [ those i put up ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/63fcxn/does_your_country_have_folktraditional_songs_that/dftrisw/ ) . 
  [ kr\u00e5kevisa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqz9nwn_b0q ) was the most common medieval ballad even when writing them down in the 19th century . 
  popular all over , including sweden and denmark . 
  there were many versions , but this one is most famous . 
  other famous old songs are [ p\u00e5l sine h\u00f8nor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqzy9jqspxa ) and `` tordivelen og fluga '' . 
  it 's the most common way to pronounce bokm\u00e5l , since it is the way people around oslo pronounce it . 
  it is only `` standard '' in that it is the way people teach immigrants to pronounce bokm\u00e5l , though it is close to how many people there speak these days . 
  must not be confused with the old dialects in the area . 
  it 's still a dialect and not official . 
  and it 's important to not that it is mostly a written language . 
  people still speak dialects most of the time . 
  \u00a8 even when reading loud the pronunciation depends on your dialect . 
  there is many differences between the bokm\u00e5l in bergen and oslo , and the nynorsk in tr\u00f8ndelag and j\u00e6ren . 
  they are only written languages , and the way you 'd pronounce them depend on your dialect . 
  although bokm\u00e5l is getting more and more localised to oslo and bergen . 
  the spoken `` posh '' speak in many other cities have been merged more with the street language , like in trondheim . 
  maybe something along the lines of a positive thing brings along another negative thing/danger ? 
  or maybe it 's just practical advice and i 've misunderstood . 
  i like weird old sayings . 
  like : * `` h\u00e6stn g\u00e5r te sies fer fr\u00e5skja '' - the horse steps aside for the frog . 
  be wary of those smaller than you . 
  * `` v\u00e6rgjen riv itt attme hie '' - the wolf does n't hunt by its lair . 
  * '' \u00c6g e s\u00e5 tr\u00f8yt at \u00e6g skj\u00e6l itt katta fr\u00e5 galsf\u00f8lkji '' - i 'm so tired that i ca n't tell the cat and the people apart . 
  * `` n\u00e5r e bli mat i hagra gjeng bj\u00f8nn i \u00e5kra '' - when the grain is grown the bear walks in the field . 
  never seen anyone do it `` in the wild '' . 
  only read about it . 
  a button . 
  universal still . 
  `` knak '' means a cracking sound in norwegian . 
  but that 's probably from german ( knakken - break ) . 
   b\u00e1d that actually comes from english . 
  even old norse got it from english . 
   none of those words are currently used in irish really ? 
  the irish words are '' * cr\u00f3 * '' and '' * sceathash * '' . 
   i wonder if any of those words are still used in scandinavian languages or just remnants of a long ago past as well . 
  post some and i 'll find out !, 
  i 'd bet all of them are in use * somewhere * . 
  sjeaks means making you dizzy . 
  `` sjeakst \u00f8l '' = beer that makes you dizzy . 
  sorn means an oven for drting grains . 
  from latin `` furnus '' or something through irish . 
  kruv ( i ) is a small fenced off area for sheep or reindeer . 
  * f\u00e5rik\u00e5l : sheep and cabbage soup with black pepper * sodd : sheep soup with ginger , dumplings and potato . 
  * klubb og duppe : potato/barley dumplings served with bacon , sauce of whey and syrup . 
  maybe . 
  norwegian only has a hanfull irish words like * skjeaks * , * sorn * and * kruv * . 
   well , iceland was settled by norwegians , and norwegians are germanic , so i 'd go with yes . 
  ireland , not iceland . 
  was going to say this myself !, 
  i bought it and even though i * am * nordic i find it useful , especially for foreign ( finnish , faroese ) dishes . 
  it has an excellent and almost complete selection of traditional and slightly newer dishes . 
  from fermented fish and blood bread to lamb soup and roasted meat . 
  now i like to make traditional food , so it may not be completely representative . 
  * ** fats ** : butter/margarine and rapeseed oil is most important . 
  some other oils as well sometimes , and i always spare bacon and other fat for frying use later . 
  * ** fruits ** : i like having some oranges and banana . 
  rarely stocked up on others , though i often buy some . 
  * ** vegetables ** : potatoes , onion , garlic , carrots and turnips/rutabaga . 
  * ** starchy carbs ** : always have some rice , and usually some beans or lentils . 
  potatoes ofc . 
  often oats and barley as well . 
  * ** types of bread ** : flatbread and [ normal ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pcnaivf4tji/t85fhlxndgi/aaaaaaaabxg/1glqgr7yrdy/s1600/001.jpg ) bread . 
  * spices : all of them !, 
  but most important is salt/pepper , garlic powder , thyme , oregano , juniper , chilli , paprika , rosemary , allspice and ginger .
