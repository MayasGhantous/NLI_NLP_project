  * ** types of meat ** : anything i find at a nice price . 
  i only buy local meat , so it varies a bit . 
  i often buy `` weird '' meats like legs and hearts to get the price down . 
  usually pig , sheep and chicken . 
  sometimes horse , game or cattle . 
  * ** nuts , seeds , etc. 
  ** : not really any nuts . 
  lots of grains and a few seeds like sesame and sunflower . 
  * ** types of cheese ** : the `` generic '' white cheese you get here , brown cheese , and sometimes cheddar or mozzarella if i make something special . 
  * ** pre-made sauces and dips ** : soy sauce , bbq sauce , `` taco '' sauce , mustard , and a ton of home made things or stock for making them . 
  i do n't use much ketchup . 
   `` $ name , please let x in ! '', 
  `` the man/woman '' , or just `` he/she '' really . 
  or his name if we know him . 
   `` x , please help me , i 'm lost ! '', 
  `` could * you * please help me , i 'm lost ? '', 
  * central norway * most of norway and some of sweden * nordic countries * northern europe maybe ? 
  not much more after that . 
  last year probably . 
  happens from time to time for the internet and electricity . 
  phone is never completely gone , but i got a really bad signal at home . 
  central and north-east norway . 
  to be fair , there is a lot of forest and few cool mountains compared to the west and north , but they are there if you look , and lots of historical places . 
  it should be mashed peas !, 
  herecy !, 
  some parts of western norway apparently eats it in waffles according to a friend . 
  lutfisk without bacon or other appropriate side dishes . 
   but another 14 % eats meat only a few days every week . 
  is fish included in that ? 
  south jutland also has remains of the pitch accent . 
  i think it 's ringsaker the guy 's from . 
  northern end of mj\u00f8sa . 
  it 's just that he uses weird words , like `` dugurdskvila '' where dugurd is a meal , `` okkle '' which means `` ankel/okle '' and `` hannom '' which is dative of `` han '' . 
  if he had used normal words it 'd be easy . 
  he tied to speak weirdly . 
   this tr\u00f8nder dialect is also incredibly difficult to understand and it 's also quite funny imo eh . 
  it 's just that one guy , who speaks quickly . 
  his dialect is n't that weird . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fggpi2uqh04 ) has kinda the same dialect , but speaks way clearer . 
  easy to understand . 
  when it comes to a * funny * dialect , i 'm not sure . 
  i 'm not laughing at how anyone speak , but that might be because [ my dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyywrqghvtg ) is often considered weird by others . 
  some may say the dialect in \u00d8stfold as well . 
  most charming i find certain dialects from [ opplanda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qib8t4_7lko ) and [ gudbrandsdalen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky8j-dfktac ) , or maybe [ old fashioned dialects form hordaland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd8c7ni15zm ) . 
  ola and kari nordmann ( northman/norwegian ) here . 
  probably varies then . 
  it 's very popular to go hiking at the smaller mountaintops here . 
  what if you get lost in the wild ? 
  i remember reading a few . 
  * anything by astrid lindgren . 
  * anything by roald dahl . 
  * charlie and the chocolate factory , matilda * , etc. 
  * anything by thorbj\u00f8rn egner . 
  * some by tove jansson . 
  * alf pr\u00f8ysen also has some books . 
  we do n't have any street sweepers or whatever , and the roads are only cleaned when volunteers and school children do it , but it 's not too bad . 
  people generally use the trash cans . 
  according to a friend that was there roads in scotland were much worse . 
  all the bigger towns tend to be more liberal/capitalist than the surrounding countryside . 
  farmers and rural/small town people are more left leaning . 
   i 'm denmark there 's something called `` ris dansk '' [ rigsdansk ] ( https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/rigsdansk ), 
   edit : someone seems to be downvoting all the new comments in this thread ... loads of new posts at 0 points currently . 
  it tends to happen when speaking about language variation for some reason . 
  no idea why . 
   i think together with italy we have the most dialects per square km . 
  i think scandinavia would be high up too . 
  look at the [ `` main '' sub-dialects of jutlandic . 
   i do n't think any swede has trouble understanding any swedish dialect * [ orsam\u00e5l ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yobyvduzlra ) * [ \u00d6vdalsk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2pxzj6ufvg ) * [ \u00d6verkalix ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgt0h0riol8 ) * [ \u00d6sterbotten ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph-h1uydyju ) * [ j\u00e4mtland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebbfjzjrnui ) i think some urban people may have trouble with some of these . 
  a lot !, 
  just like in denmark and sweden . 
  though the dialects here are much more common to hear in public here , and even on tv people usually speak their dialects or a milder variant of it . 
  compare relatively far apart [ tr\u00f8nder ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyywrqghvtg ) ( lim\u00e5l ) and [ vestlandsk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n02lzgz7guo ) ( setesdal , the guy ) . 
  [ here 's a simple map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ypjdz8m.png ) of how you 'd form plurals in dialects for example . 
  not too many miners in norway . 
  nowadays we earn more `` mining '' sand , gravel and stone . 
  but probably labour or centre ( rural ) party . 
  i think he messed up the number . 
   it contains more than * half a million * lithuanian headwords , and is 20 volumes ( 22 thousand pages ) long . 
  - wikipedia, 
  i do n't know if you are wrong , but that wikipedia article says :  it contains more than half a million lithuanian headwords , so , 500 000 + or so words ? 
  sure that is n't the total number of words used to write the book or something ? 
  not a thing any more , kinda . 
  if you 're born before 1971 then the 1905 rules apply . 
  i 've you 're born before 1990 then men go before women . 
  for anyone born after then it 's completely equal . 
  whenever there is a swede in any kind of commercial or short message here , he will be from sk\u00e5ne . 
  i would n't know how to describe those things . 
  only superficial things like i wrote above , since they are basically the same as us . 
  they are friendly at least , but making the friends can be difficult in the start . 
  you have to distinguish between north swedes , swedes and south swedes ( scanians ) . 
  how people in central norway might see it : northern swedes are fine . 
  good people who speak good dialects , struggling against the eu even though they voted no ( like us ) . 
  from about dalarna or even v\u00e4rmland and up . 
  especially those just across the border , who 's considered better than some norwegians . 
  swedes are most other swedish people . 
  the ones you see on the news , pippi and in emil i l\u00f6nneberga . 
  lots of jokes about these , but probably nice people . 
  they better not bring up the invasions though . 
  then there is sk\u00e5ne ( and areas close to ) . 
  people around where i live usually does n't like the dialect there , probably because it 's the go-to choice in commercials and such for some reason .
