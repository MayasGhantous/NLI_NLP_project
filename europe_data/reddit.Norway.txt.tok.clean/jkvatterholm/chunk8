  no one ever goes that far south either . 
  second oldest in the world after usa if i 'm not wrong . 
  not common in norway on a county level , because most of them does n't fit with actual cultural regions that well and are mostly administrative . 
  on a smaller scale many valleys and towns have their own though . 
  and [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkcet4riwtm ) is sometimes called the national song of northern norway . 
  you have [ j\u00e4mtlandssongen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aixso-r1giw ) !, 
  a version in [ the local dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bama8hg3ukm ) also exists . 
  it really is a problem . 
  you got the only sizeable population of wild haggis left after the scandinavian subspecies ( * haggis korvkaka * ) died out . 
  you 're only considered norwegian as long as you speak good norwegian ( among other things ) , so the diaspora is mostly people who moved out to foreign places recently and a few stubborn norwegian-americans . 
  speaking to first and second generation emigrants is kinda interesting , but most norwegian-americans are just normal americans with a norwegian grandmother . 
  moving to london for work is `` meh '' , moving to spain to form norwegian ghettos full of old people close to the beach is kinda looked down upon . 
  there is [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q-qfnlep4a ) with actual scenes from a smaller but similar landslide . 
  at 8:20 there 's whole houses just floating away before breaking apart . 
  quite haunting . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wov01r6dgdw ) low budget documentary in norwegian . 
  i 've tried to translate [ a couple of accounts from that night ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onstqmzhwoc ) to english . 
  in my area it was by far the landslide of 1893 . 
  we get them all the time , since the ground is `` quick '' - clay , but that one was a deadly one . 
  after midnight 19th of may 105 farms , 116 people and countless animals were taken . 
  it is still clearly remembered and taught , with some quite haunting stories of people losing family and homes . 
  [ flooded farms ] ( http://www.t-a.no/incoming/article8970551.ece/binary/w980/18lok23janne_pauline_bruhei-1.jpg ) . 
  [ the crater ] ( http://verdalsbilder.no/cpg1410/albums/userpics/10004/rasetmorguddingsbakkan.jpg ) . 
  a [ deep crater ] ( http://verdalsbilder.no/cpg1410/albums/userpics/10004/huspaaraskanten.jpg ) . 
   camping outside a camping ground without permission is not legal . 
  this includes using a car instead of a tent . 
  even in the forest or such ? 
   not allowed why is that ? 
  here it 's encouraged to stop and sleep rather than drive tired . 
  * central norway and central sweden . 
  * norway and parts of sweden . 
  * nordic countries . 
  * northern europe . 
  i 'd just find it interesting . 
  it would n't affect me in any way , but if people want it it would be interesting to see . 
  though , can you actually leave the us legally as the laws are now ? 
  i 'm really interested in germanic languages . 
  north germanic mainly . 
  one of my favourite hobbies it to learn about them . 
  uralic ( mostly sami ) are also interesting . 
  i do n't really feel much connection to `` europe '' . 
  nordic for sure , but beyond that it feels quite foreign to me , and could just as well be canada . 
  it 's far away as well . 
  well , you got the l\u00e6stadianerne as you said which are popular especially among northern sami people . 
  and various other smaller churches who did n't feel like the state church was enough . 
  historically movements such as [ haugean movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haugean_movement ) for example . 
  very very few catholics and jews historically . 
  jews were banned until 1851 , monks until 1897 , and jesuits until 1956 . 
  we have our own `` bible belt '' , which is the southern part of norway and dots in the west . 
  most of them are just `` normal '' church of norway , while some are weirder sects . 
  not very common at all . 
  most town are too small for them anyway , and the ones who might be big enough does not quite fit with that kind of architecture . 
  it might just be my friends , but it seems most people think about new buildings like `` ugly grey steel , concrete and glass things '' . 
  i 'd prefer the countryside . 
  if not then either reykjav\u00edk or a northern swedish town . 
  you can use the norwegian word both for `` stay '' and `` become '' . 
  bli her - stay here bli med - come with ( me ), 
  you have `` bliva '' with kinda that meaning in a naval context . 
  * `` hann bleiv p\u00e5 sj\u00f8a '' - he died ( stayed ) at sea . 
  * and you can use it for `` stay '' . 
  `` bli her '' = stay/be here . 
  `` han vart igjen '' = he stayed behind/he became behind but that is also true for the native word . 
  though , i am not sure if that was true in old norse , or if it is an influence from the imported word . 
  [ klubb ] ( http://cdn.mytaste.org/i?u=http%3a%2f%2fbloggfiler.no%2fhemgjort.blogg.no%2fimages%2f1452595-9-1360331533250.jpg&amp;w=330&amp;h=270&amp;c=1 ) . 
  boiled potato dough with bacon and whey sauce . 
  eat it every thursday . 
  not quite the same , but there is and has always been a movement to leave the eea , but it does n't seem likely to grow too much yet . 
  mostly popular among farmers , leftists and far right . 
  one as basic as `` to become '' . 
  - it comes from older bliva , from middle low german bliven . 
  the old norse variant is '' * ver\u00f0a * '' , which is still in use a few places . 
  the funny thing is the way it has been adopted though . 
  most dialects do n't use either or , but a mix of the two . 
  like `` kruvi '' is used in my area only . 
  it means a fenced off area , and comes from irish . 
  i kinda sigh when people make songs in english . 
  i get that they get access to a much larger audience , but still . 
  it is n't really the same . 
  not really norwegian , just another foreign song . 
  most people speak okay english . 
  you do get a few [ cringe-worthy ones ] ( https://youtu.be/dcmauwpa-5o?t=24 ) though , or people who use it when not necessary . 
  what do you mean ? 
  do you mean france ? 
  basque country is in spain and france , not portugal . 
   that 's not a stave building , it has been supported later with staves when the log wall has started to crumble from rot . 
  might just be a different kind of `` stave build '' then or some error in translation . 
  the barn is an old design though . 
  more or less the same as [ finnloftet ] ( https://oalannblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_8616.jpg?w=648 ) from the 13th century . 
  i 've got nothing against stave buildings . 
  i really like them actually . 
  but the style in skyrim looks nothing like anything ever used in norway . 
  look at [ these ] ( https://ryanglover92.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/whiterun.jpg ) or [ these ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/elderscrolls/images/b/b5/chillfurrow_farm.png/revision/latest?cb=20141014114036 ) . 
  inspired by norse buildings for sure in the decoration , but no building like that has been built in norway . 
  it 's pure fantasy . 
  and this is not the same as the stave churches . 
  stave churches are stave buildings built on stones to keep them off the ground . 
  buildings in skyrim are more primitive , and the poles go into the dirt . 
  more similar to norse longhouses . 
  stave buildings have been used into modern times , like this [ barn ] ( https://oalannblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/helleve-c3b8yjord-under-fjose-to-107.jpg?w=648 ) . 
  to say it 's the only native architectural style in scandinavia seems kinda wrong .
