  we had or developed other styles , like [ grindbygg ] ( https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/images/2004-05-28-ytsteskotet04b.jpg ) and [ l\u00e5n ] ( http://verdalsbilder.no/cpg1410/albums/userpics/10028/molaanaoppsetting1955haa.jpg ) . 
  the roads get cleared ( hopefully ) , so 10 cm or 50 cm does n't make much difference . 
  so just normal cars . 
  cold hard snow is a good surface to drive on , when mixed with gravel . 
  ice and wet snow is much worse . 
  i 'd rather have it snow a lot and stay at -10 than hover around 0 . 
  a lot of the mountains would fit somewhat better there , but skyrim has trees and land animals . 
  iceland does not . 
  i just think they wanted a generic `` norse '' feel . 
  i 'm pretty tired of being compared to skyrim actually . 
  personally i do n't even see the similarity . 
  the terrain is just all wrong , it does n't feel norwegian at all . 
  the mountains especially feels more like the alps or something . 
  and do n't get me started on the weird houses . 
  * various [ salticidae ] ( http://www.edderkopper.net/bilder/salticidae/evarcha%20arcuata%20hunn%20c.jpg ) * various [ philodromidae ] ( http://www.edderkopper.net/bilder/philodromus/philodromus%20margaritatus%20male%20juvenile%202%20febr%20600.jpg ) * various [ sparassidae ] ( http://www.edderkopper.net/bilder/sparassidae/micrommata%20virescens%20on%20nose.jpg ) * various [ agelenidae ] ( http://www.edderkopper.net/bilder/agelenidae/tegenaria%20atrica%20male%20side%20febr%20600.jpg ) and many more . 
  i think around 550 species registered or something like that . 
  biggest is probably [ tegenaria atrica ] ( https://www.fhi.no/globalassets/bilder/x-gamle-bilder/natur-id1116ny-mappe/stor-husedderkopp2.jpg?preset=mainbodywidth ) , with a leg-leg span of up to 10cm . 
  well it was the 13th century . 
  you did join us about then . 
  excluding the works done in iceland , the most famous norwegian work might be konungs skuggsj\u00e1 , or the king 's mirror from around 1250 . 
  it is a handbook about how to be a king , basically . 
  and arts of warfare and natural knowledge . 
   there is a fish not yet mentioned which it is scarcely advisable to speak about on account of its size , which to most men will seem incredible . 
  there are , moreover , but very few who can tell anything definite about it , inasmuch as it is rarely seen by men ; for it almost never approaches the shore or appears where fishermen can see it , and i doubt that this sort of fish is very plentiful in the sea . 
  in our language it is usually called the `` kra - ken . '', 
  sometimes in older book , or older people or sayings . 
  though even they use metric almost always . 
  we 've used it since the 1870 's or something after all . 
  boats are in feet , and some stuff in inches/thumbs , but other than that it 's rare . 
  where i 'm from : either the sketchy biker place , the overpriced new place , or wait until some special occasion or community feast either in the town or in some community house up in the valley that allows alcohol . 
  most common is coming home to someone , then eat and drink moonshine and beer in smaller groups . 
  you usually know all the people showing already , unless they are the typical stranger from another valley that comes to all parties anyway . 
  yeah . 
  anything but people who speak too quick in some of the weirder ones . 
  those usually work out just fine too as long as they do n't speak too fast .

  how often do you see the lights though ? 
  no reason to go there for op if you only see it a couple of times per year . 
  i 've been in northern norway and iceland . 
  of the two i think norway is more acessible , with more proper towns up there , but both are really pretty . 
  sweden/finland/russia i 'm not sure about . 
  i 'd look at the things you can do/see besides the lights . 
  maybe skiing ? 
  we do n't learn any norse , besides looking at just a very general overview next to a sample text during like a single day . 
  though we usually read at least one saga and learn language history . 
  not really any runes either , as far as i could remember . 
  the period 1349-1800 is almost empty . 
  no norwegian language texts , only danish , and not anyone we really read . 
  maybe except some danish text from writers such as ludvig holberg and peter dass , often modernised or side-by-side . 
  19th century texts are read as-is , though partially modernised versions exist . 
  this was also the time when norwegian dialects was gathered to create a new written standard ( nynorsk/landsm \u00e5l ) and the danish standard started to change to better fit as a norwegian standard ( rigsm\u00e5l / bokm\u00e5l ) . 
  my parent generation got to learn norse at school . 
  wish they brought that back . 
  120.000 people came to watch a-ha play in frognerparken in 2005 . 
  it was free . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqigcl-a3uq ), 
  lorry , apartment and rent . 
  i 'm all for more support going to sami culture and language , as well as their right to self determination in many matters . 
  but this seems mostly to be done to get attention of for fun by the group . 
  i know it ca n't be very serious . 
  maybe similar to how `` jra '' and [ the republic of jamtland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_jamtland ) was created as a semi serious semi humorous parody of ira ? 
  ira did `` terrorist '' things as well . 
  and then the central parts/tr \u00f8ndelag with a mix of everything . 
  very similar to norway !, 
  except pickles and pumpkin . 
  though we usually do n't put it out at once in a `` buffet '' like that . 
  the saga where the the christian king h\u00e1kon is forced to celebrate christmas/yule when he came to my area . 
   [ ... ] the first full goblet was filled , earl sigurd spoke some words over it , blessed it in odin 's name , and drank to the king out of the horn ; and the king then took it , and made the sign of the cross over it . 
   then said kar of gryting , `` what does the king mean by doing so ? 
  will he not sacrifice ? '', 
  earl sigurd replies , `` the king is doing what all of you do , who trust to your power and strength . 
  he is blessing the full goblet in the name of thor [ ... ] '' [ ... ] the bondes pressed the king strongly to eat of horse-flesh ; and as he would on no account do so , [ ... ] they insisted he should at least taste the gravy ; [ ... ] earl sigurd came and made peace among them , by asking the king to hold his mouth over the handle of the kettle , upon which the fat smoke of the boiled horse-flesh had settled itself ; [ ... ]  but neither party was satisfied with this . 
  [ ... ] the bondes insisted hard with the king that he should offer sacrifice , and threatened him with violence if he refused . 
  [ ... ] the king took some bits of horse-liver , and emptied all the goblets the bondes filled for him without the sign of the cross ; but as soon as the feast was over , the king and the earl returned to hlader . 
   the king was very ill pleased , [ ... ] saying that the next time he came to throndheim , he would come with such strength of men-at-arms that he would repay the bondes for their enmity towards him . 
  popular around here !, 
  as always i look at norway/sweden first , and it actually does the border well for once !, 
  even the norwegian/russian border seems right . 
  but it shows jamtland as being part of sweden until 1178 , it should be an independent area more like . 
  i go to sweden every 2-3 months to stock up on cheep but sinful ( at least among farmers ) eu meat and alcohol . 
  live an hour from the border . 
  2 hours to the closest store . 
  then my family always used to go to either northern sweden or jutland in the summer on holyday . 
  great beaches and stuff there . 
  holiday to `` the south '' in the summer . 
  maybe every second one . 
  by `` the south '' is ment any place with cheep beer and warm beaches . 
  from portual to bulgaria and egypt . 
  i did the genographic one , which is not quite the same but still fun . 
  * the paternal line is i-z73 , shared by 0.6 % of the world . 
  * i 'm 2,3 % neanderthal and 3,6 % denisovan , a bit above average . 
  * i am about 48 % `` northern european '' . 
  a couple of % less than the average , though i am like 20 % `` south asian '' , which is about 4 % more than the average . 
  no idea why . 
  it was expensive , but interesting . 
  dunno about those ones made to find relatives or whatever . 
  credit to / u/ostehoevel for [ this masterpiece . 
  i think the eu should join sealand . 
  `` nissen '' we call him . 
  `` the nisse '' .
