   `` stay in the eu '' - not even an option , you 'd have to rejoin , which means first you need to be independent , then you have to apply for normal membership , which could take a couple of years . 
  how do you know ? 
  nobody seems to know the answer to that particular problem , so how the hell do you , some redditor from austria , know the future of scottish membership in the eu ? 
   and you 're only going to be a member if you accept a worse deal than the uk had and you have to use the euro , no more pound sterling ( might be a bonus tbh ) . 
  how.do.you.know ? 
  either you are an eu politician with to much time on your hand ( seeing as you are posting shit on reddit during working hours ) , or you are flinging shit in the wind just to see where it lands . 
  when did terrorist attacks become a competition ? 
  and after a short period , denmark . 
   nej it is pronounced chexit aaaah , som i chebab ? 
  are you talking about the white flag on the moon ? 
  wouldnt that make it french ? 
  you claimed the moon for france . 
  you take that back , you heathen !, 
  hungarians put sugar on pasta . 
  [ hey hey , not so fast !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rsfpgfmjli ), 
  yeah , but now you bring in fishing , which is another important reason for why norway declined to join eu . 
  decimation of fishing in the north sea would ( possibly ) have been an outcome of norway joining eu . 
  so not only would we loose our agriculture , we would loose our fishing as well . 
  what we would be left with is oil . 
  and as recent events has shown , narrowing the norwegian industry to only one sector is a really shitty idea in the long run . 
  probably , but it is subsidies that allow the farmers to continue to farm despite low ( fairly ) income , and the import tax protects them from eu competition . 
  basically , if norway wants to continue to farm and have norwegian produce , we need both . 
  ( at least it is the way i understand it ), 
  well if your claim is correct and that i am indeed pulling strawman arguments , then lets look at a destilled version of what i believe this discussion is about : * eu is a body where larger countries carry louder voices through representation . 
  * as a result , larger countries decide what is going to happen , possibly at the expense of the smaller countries . 
  now over to the history ( i opened the door to norway , so i will keep it open ) . 
  one of the major reasons why norway decided to stay out of [ eu was because of fishing ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/03/29/norway-and-the-eu/ ) . 
  we feared that opening our waters to fishing from eu countries would lead to a collapse in fish , as did happen in [ canada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collapse_of_the_atlantic_northwest_cod_fishery ) . 
  by a brief google search i found [ this ] ( http://www.ianduncan.org.uk/index.php/site/article/current_eu_norway_fish_talks_more_important_than_ever ) regarding the agreements of fishing in the north sea . 
  now to the point i am trying to make : if olav ( the norwegian ) entrust fritz ( the eu politician ) to allow fishing by gregor ( the scot ) , and all the others ( faroese , islandic , english , and irish ) in norwegian waters , it could lead to a fishing collapse which does not directly affect fritz . 
  this would be a decision pushed through by the uk ( loud voice ) and norway ( the quiet voice ) would be hurt by this . 
  fritz on the other hand , does not give two shits , because fritz does not work with fish . 
  and since norway is a [ contributor to the eu ] ( http://www.eu-norway.org/eu/financial-contribution/ ) , the support of olav , by fritz would be completely absent . 
  ( norway is not part of eu , and i cant find any estimate of how much norway would have been paying anually if we were , but when the eu discussion was big , it was said that norway would be giving , not recieving ) . 
  yeah , you were right , i didnt understand your empire point until you drew it out , but you are kind of supporting my argument with it . 
  roman empire was romans ruling over the english ( in your example ) more or less by force and on the expense of the english . 
   and your wrong . 
  following my logic , you would get ` hire the right person for the job , regardless of where they come from ' . 
  it 's how successful businesses run . 
  it 's how empires have been run . 
  ** i 'm gon na presume you 're of working-class income ** , for argument 's sake : you have much , much more in common with a working-class person from the other side of the world , than you do with the rich people in your society that form the political class . 
  didnt miss the `` purely for arguments sake '' bit , because its not there . 
  it did come off as if you were saying `` you are clearly an eu sceptic , and as such you must be working class '' . 
   local politicians are to be trusted , senior ones not ? 
  no politicians are to be trusted . 
  but if they are not `` local '' and situated far away , they should be trusted even less . 
  this is because no reprocussions will come of a decision made to affect an area far removed . 
  any person working with the emense amount of power these politicians do , should not be trusted . 
  we need them , no doubt , but still . 
   i do n't think i 've ever seen such a contradictory sentence . 
  i wo n't bother arguing , because that statement comes across like the angry ramblings of a pub drunk ... you have really no way of knowing that , and you are definitely not qualified to make that call by yourself . 
  not remotely . 
  heh , yeah but it was kind of the point . 
  it was a statement from me , so that it would allow you to get a clearer picture of my own opinions . 
  but if what you want from me is a way to `` solve '' the problems of governance in the eu , you wont get it . 
  what i am pointing at is the governance of ( lets say ) estland , by german delegates , and how the interest of the two not always allign . 
   `` this is the internet , no one is winning an argument here '' totally agree , ** if winning is indeed your goal ** . 
  nope not my goal . 
   so i took time to write this and illustrate how all your argumental ` facts ' are hubris : personal opinions , and a general air of ` everyone knows that ... ' . 
  its not scientific , it 's just your opinions , and should be framed as such . 
  and i appreciate the discourse . 
  while the statements i have made in this thread has mostly been opinions ( and given you plenty of ammunition against me ) , some of it is actually factual ( i included some sources this time around ) . 
  same thing could also be said about your statements btw . 
  this is the internet , no one is winning any argument here , but i think it is important that you get some input from a different perspective . 
  so here we go :  you forget that fritz 's tax contributions fund the hand-outs that keep olav in a job . 
  if the handouts were n't there and fritz and olav were actually competing , instead of cooperating , olav would probably be unemployed by now . 
  but of course , olav does n't notice the food , infrastructure and social systems kept afloat by the eu . 
  olav only gives a shit about himself , ethics be damned . 
  factually wrong . 
  overfishing in the north sea puts olav out of a job , and a rich norway makes norway a contributor to eu , not a recipiant of whatever fritz gives . 
  also fritz and olav are not directly competing , and fritz \u00b4 s lack of local knowlege destroys olav \u00b4 s possibility for long term sustainable work . 
  all due to short term gains for fritz . 
  what i am saying is that while some goals for both fritz and olav may allign , on most points they wont . 
   it 's how empires have been run . 
  feel free to start listing them , because i cant come up with a single one . 
  chinese ? 
  japanese ? 
  roman ? 
  british ? 
  which of them has ever been ruled by forigners as an empire ? 
   i 'm gon na presume you 're of working-class income your assumption is really far off , and that was an excessively arrogant statement . 
  lets say i was a member of the working class , does that somehow invalidate my point ? 
  does it fit your narrative better if i were from the working class ? 
   you have much , much more in common with a working-class person from the other side of the world , than you do with the rich people in your society that form the political class . 
  then why would i like to get my life dictated by some politician in brussels ? 
   you want a symbolic mascot politician that looks and sounds like you , assumptions are the mother of all fuckups . 
  no i do not want a mascot , but if you honestly think the politicians in brussels ( or anywhere else for that matter ) are there to `` serve the people '' , you are incredible naive . 
  local politicians listen to local population because of local repercussions of not doing so . 
  here is a statement for you ( so you can stop assuming ) : no politician really knows what the hell they are doing . 
  politicians are given positions , not due to ability , but rather political seniority ( how that assures quality is a mystery ) . 
  they are all power hungry animals , living in a small bubble . 
  if they had been working towards the greater good of europe , you wouldnt have any focus on which region would have too much power ( strasburg vs brussels ) because it wouldnt be a factor . 
  all countries in the eu would have equal votes with one representative only . 
  and creation of a federal eu would not be a problem , because politicians would not mind giving up power . 
  none of this will come to fruition because its not the way the world is . 
   xenophobia is the only answer . 
  it has nothing to do with xenophobia and everything to do with a local understanding of local problems . 
  while fishing rights in the north sea does not affect the fritz from berlin , it does affect olav from troms\u00f8 . 
  as a result it would serve olav less , to allow fritz to decide .
