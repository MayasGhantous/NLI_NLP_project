  especially when spoken loudly and angrily . 
  he 's pointing out the refreshing lack of xenophobic white superiority circlejerking . 
  you balkanbros should kick poland square in the nuts . 
  i 'm scared with you , friend . 
  the estonians i 've seen on / r/europe have all been utter shitheads , especially in threads regarding muslims and immigrants and other spooky brown people . 
  paris is worse , because these attackers are * muslims * and therefore 2spooky4/r/europe, 
  ek praat nie afrikaans nie wait . . that 's the other dutch . 
  shit . 
   `` sorry , comrade , we do n't speak that language any more . '', 
  bahahaha, 
  you 're both bastards , now calm down before i call crazy cousin finland on your ass !, 
  how are attitudes towards lgbt people in croatia compared to serbia ? 
  the most childish candidate i 've seen so far was that one fat ex-military democrat who spent all of his allocated minutes complaining about his allocated minutes . 
  as hilarious as it was cringeworthy . 
  do you think taking in refugees is something we do because we expect to make a profit out of it ? 
  we 're people , not ferengi . 
  says a lot about the state of this subreddit when poe 's law is as relevant as it is, 
  [ mfw this thread ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/210/050/tumblr_lv9gy159oi1r2avnn.gif ), 
  * see * muslims ? 
  with what , your magical muslim-spotting glasses ? 
  * laughs , then starts sobbing *, 
   because nobody actually wants to live here you guys have legalised prostitution and more or less decriminalised weed , right ? 
  and you make dank video games , * and * price levels are low ? 
  i 'd do it . 
  stop it , my euroboner can only get so hard . 
  nah , / u/joeflux studied white supremacy at the university of / r/european . 
  his facts definitely check out . 
  they 've recovered * insanely * well , all things considered . 
   e.g. 
  part of norway is poorer than somalia !, 
  it 's about a street intersection where 2 homeless guys live . 
  there are homeless people here ? 
  what the fuck are you on about ? 
  needing a proper beating ? 
  strong male ? 
  strong mom ? 
  you do n't hit children . 
  that 's child abuse , and a perfectly valid reason for the cps to haul your child the hell away from you . 
  not in europe , though . 
  this is europe , we 're all fairly fluent in sarcasm . 
  i thought adding an '' / s '' was redundant . 
  so ... foreign guys are popular in czechia ? 
  * note to self : czechia . 
  soon . 
  spoiler tag that shit , bruh, 
  a swede . 
  ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  is sympathisers are definitely not nonexistent in sweden , and the lefties can get more than a bit angry and throw things that are a bit more dangerous than stones . 
  still though , there are a lot more sd-sympathisers then there are is sympathisers . 
  as long as the sd-sympathisers let out their anger by voting sd , that 's fine by me . 
  it 's when they go full retard and set fire to asylum centers or chop up kids with swords that shit hits the fan . 
  it 's more than a bit ironic that these die-hard '' anti-islamists '' choose to fight against this islamist threat they perceive everywhere by fucking * attacking children * with ** swords ** . 
  i mean , what the actual fuck ? 
  is would be proud of them . 
  god forbid europe changes . 
  ca n't have any change . 
  nope . 
  i do n't want a more renewable future , i do n't want a united europe , and i do n't want to legalise weed because that would mean * chaaaange * . 
  judging by the leaked pictures of him in cringe-worthy all-black clothing with a stahlhelm and trenchcoat , i 'd wager we 're talking about an anti-immigrant attack here . 
  any pr is good pr . 
  says a lot about the state of this sub when that * / s * is actually necessary . 
  classical far-right argument . 
  '' i do n't agree with breiviks * actions * , but the man had a point '' . 
  he did n't . 
  it 's a bit sad - but mostly scary - how active the far-right movement seems to be in sweden . 
  to say that anything related to refugees is ever `` discussed '' on / r/europe is a bit of a stretch . 
  it 's a circlejerk of `` lel sweden cuckistan '' and `` lel merkel will doom europe eurabia 2k16 '' . 
   i 'm not seeing anyone blaming immigrants for the fire that 's just a sign that the mods have finally gotten their shit together . 
  we * are * talking about swedes here . 
   massive shift to the right by the german electorate * uh-oh *, 
  when you grow in a world where english is omnipresent - on the tv , in video games , on the internet - * not * being fluent in it would be the real impressive feat . 
  it 's a very interesting phenomenon , and one americans and brits simply do n't experience in the same way as people from smaller countries do . 
  i 've always been a * yuge * ( see , i even speak donald trump ! ), 
  video game nerd , so it probably not that much of a stretch to claim that i heard as much english through my headphones as i did norwegian growing up . 
  my internal monologue switches over to english now and then , which is just another testament to how much of a global phenomenon english is as a language . 
  languages are fun !, 
  and humans are all still not only the same species , but the same * sub * species ( despite what / r/european would have you believe ) , while bears are a family . 
  '' do you think refugees suck ? 
  also , do you think angela merkel is ^ ^ ^ ^ * not * a decent chancellor ? '', 
  cruel , unusual and degrading punishment . 
  ~ ~ ice ~ ~ ~ ~ solar ~ ~ polar beers come from another savage violent culture imcompatble with our western peaceful culture , get them out help our own peopleple first !!, 
  no , us ethnic norwegians would never do anything like that . 
  look who 's talking  still mad about that whole independence thing ? 
   better ? 
  agree . 
  i 'm sure you 're one of those eastern european crybabies who use arguments such as `` czechia is 2 poor 4 handle these spooki muslims , orban is stronk we do not sow '' , am i right ? 
   i 'm against stricter controls on immigration and probably one of the most liberal people here . 
  that sentence alone is likely to give what seems to be most of / r/europe nowadays severe arthritis from furiously mashing the downvote button . 
  that alone gets you an upvote from me  i agree with you wholeheartedly . 
   unlike some muslims . 
  what the fuck are you even saying here , that all mexicans are perfect decent hard-working people ? 
  * `` ttip is bad , m ` kay '' * * redditor * , 2015, 
  ca n't wait for the rabid anti- `` migrants '' to bomb this thread and shit all over the good news . 
  wait . 
  sub-saharan norway , because the danes are just so ridiculously tan . 
  i would say it 's unfair , but i 've got more than enough oil to smear all across my body for that perfect winter tan . 
  the swedes have n't evolved the mental capacity needed to use big words like `` great britain '' or `` the uk '' , and so have to use `` england '' . 
  do n't claim to speak for the rest of us scandinavians , though . 
  most norwegians are well aware of the difference between england and the uk ( granted , the distinction between the uk and the gb might be a bit more muddled , i see how people can forget ni ) . 
   but dr1 and tv2 does a lot to avoid being called racist .
