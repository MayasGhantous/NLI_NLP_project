   for most people . 
  depends on where those people are from . 
  i 'd wager that here , where socialism is a term that , when used in public discourse , refers to the one or two significant political parties that are * actually * socialist - and promote * actual * socialism , not social democracy or welfare schemes - people are n't as politically illiterate as they apparently are in the us . 
  30 $ , bloody expensive ? 
  what are you , a * swede * ? 
  socialism ? 
  screw socialism . 
  norway is n't socialist , and neither are the vast , vast majority of the country 's inhabitants . 
  yes , because the labor party are * such * environmentalists . 
  i 'm from a western island municipality with 12 000 people , and get by just fine with the bus . 
  room for improvement , sure , but far from hopeless . 
  i think the situation is much worse in the most desolate parts of the north , and then it 'd have more to to with the lack of people ( = demand ) than the terrain . 
  is ... is someone cutting onions in here ? 
  swedes are definitely seen as reserved and a bit stiff , even by their fellow scandinavians . 
  the jovial danebros , meanwhile , are seen as relaxed , content and friendly - anti-swedes , in a way . 
  finns are even worse than swedes , but they protect us against the russians , so i 'd never dare to tease them . 
  because muh pure eastern european nations * must * be safer than the islamic caliphate of western europe , statistics be damned !!! 1 !, 
  ** long live free kebab **, 
  suck it , japan !, 
   decent living  polish standards pick one, 
  thanks , now i 've got a certain bon jovi song playing non-stop in my head . 
  what ? 
  * no shop window-hookers ? 
  * 0/10 country would not visit, 
  you just ordered a thousand liters milk !, 
  ure fookn crusin fer a brusin ye cheeky breeki, 
  i read the first sentence , literally thought '' this guy is an ... '' , then skimmed to the part where it said '' ... an american '' . 
  threats of or incitement of violence are illegal in europe too , though . 
  the areas where america 's legal system * do * seem * less * free speech-oriented than it is here - at least to my eyes - are the ones concerning libel , slander and defamation . 
  '' suing people '' comes across as a much more common way to settle a difference in the states , and a consequence of that is that americans seem thin-skinned and exceptionally eager to make a '' quick '' buck off a court case . 
  reality is obviously a lot more nuanced than that , what with headlines about particularly ridiculous lawsuits not being representative of all americans , but still . 
   as an american,

  this is some next-level branter . 
  another lover of danes checking in . 
  swedes do n't hold a candle to them . 
  actual footage of the swedish national football team preparing for their next big game, 
  then why do greek and hungarian football fans do the same thing ? 
  no , the mexicans are going to pay for it . 
  and it just got ten ~ ~ feet ~ ~ ~ ~ meters ~ ~ metres longer !, 
  thanks , but the language barrier is steep . 
  my potato-lodged-in-esophagus is a bit rusty , so i think i 'll stay in / r/nordvei  ^ ^ love ^ ^ u ^ ^ danebro, 
  and sweden , well . . sweden has swedes . 
   the only two eu sceptic parties with any influence make up 10-12 % of the votes in the parliament . 
  feels good , man . 
  ca n't wait to be liberated from the iron grip of the tyrant known as king harald !, 
   the young are the most against it . 
  have a source for that ? 
  being a young norwegian who 's in favor of eu membership , i have the impression that the opposite is true and that younger people look at the union more favorably . 
  the labor party , conservative party , liberal party and progress party all have youth wings that are more vigorous in their support for membership than their more reluctant mother parties . 
   historically people in the uk or denmark have nothing to do with greece . 
  not sure about the danes , but i know that i appreciate the degree to which greco ( - roman ) culture has left an everlasting influence on the culture found in my nation ; from real , concrete things like political institutions to abstract things like words . 
  yep . 
  of all sad words of tongue and pen , the saddest are these : / pol / was right again, 
  that 's a ten, 
  no , we 've got ta take it further . 
  * the holy terran imperium of man * . 
  ever-so-subtle patriotism . 
   * male * height  does n't include half of europe, 
  many , including my parents . 
  #america , fuck yeah , coming again to teach you etymology, 
   alex jones level of stupidity watch your globalist mouth we 're coming for you 1776 will commence again, 
  wild ( ersly ) anti-muslim , even !, 
  being anti-islam is n't necessarily xenophobic . 
  on the contrary , the sharpest critics of religion have always been those dastardly radical liberals . 
  there 's a very big difference between being ardently anti-islam and being ardently anti-muslim . 
   he 's doing just about everything he 's campaigned on like not intervening in syria , looking into prosecuting hillary clinton , and deporting every illegal immigrant currently in the us ? 
  republicanism is a democratic system , presidents-for-life in banana dictatorships notwithstanding . 
  fair enough . 
  you said that the vast majority of germans believe that there are more important issues than gay marriage . 
  i agree with that majority , but i also disagree with what i perceived to be your implication , namely that gay marriage should n't be legalised in germany because there are more important issues . 
  the vast majority of germans have a laughably simplistic view of politics , then . 
  `` we should n't do x because we need to do y '' is n't an argument , and anyone who claims so - not saying you are - are most likely on the losing side of an issue . 
   how is he even a left-winger . 
  he just seems like a liberal , civil guy . 
  to the conspiratards on / r/the _ donald , liberals are leftists ... 
   and we would have been a republic today . 
  say , any frenches willing to send a napoleon or two my way ? 
  the fact that this happens one year , on the day , after the brussels attacks , makes it hard to believe it is n't is ' way of celebrating the anniversary . 
  so do i. 
  dutchies are the best europeans , confirmed . 
  a heartfelt thank you to you and other dutchies who voted for a liberal europe . 
  a `` pure '' democracy ? 
  you mean a hypothetical state where the slight majority gets to decide what to do with the slight minority through constant referendums ? 
  no thanks . 
  how do you reckon d66 are going to do today ? 
  i give up, 
  full of olive-skinned people in football t-shirts who eat bacalao . 
  was ruled by salazar , the local franco , for a long period after ww2 . 
  political parties defy naming conventions ( e.g. 
  the nominal social democrats are n't social democrats ) , and the hdi must be the lowest in western europe . 
  former colonial empire , and home to several early modern explorers , like vasco di gama . 
  capital is lisboa . 
  has been a unitary state for a long time , since way back when spain was n't . 
  admireable drug policy . 
  also , a long standing alliance with the uk . 
  like , really long standing . 
  you calling other people dumb is delightfully ironic . 
  me too, 
  catholic scum pls go,
