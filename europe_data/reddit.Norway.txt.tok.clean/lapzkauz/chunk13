   flatlander circlejerk only . 
  but ... 
  i want to hang out with the dutchies and the danes , not the swedes :(, 
  he is . 
  i have a sneaking suspicion that chart just * might * be a reeking pile of inaccurate drivel , and i 'm not * only * saying that because it lists norway 's as lower than sweden 's ^ ^ :( . 
  the fact that the average iq of albania is listed as * 82 * - practically , literally retarded - should be enough of a warning sign in itself . 
  i suspect it has mainly to do with them basing it on `` student assessments '' , whatever they 've meant by that . 
  the finnish school system is good , finnish students do well , and thus , according to that chart , finns have a relatively high average iq . 
  and this is all before considering how stupid it is to compare iq estimates between countries . 
  but , like your username says , dunno lol . 
   his joke is n't that the emails were n't bad stuff . 
  neither hillary 's spooky ** e-mails ** nor any of the dnc `` scandals '' were `` bad stuff '' as i saw them . 
  the focus on those two single issues are even less understandable when considering that the other presidential hopeful was , well , cheeto mussolini . 
  b-but ... 
  her ** e m a i l s ** ** m ** ** a ** ** i ** ** l ** ** s **, 
  why would they shoot people of the book ? 
  of course he can deny that . 
  remember the five billion !, 
  i like how the leader of die republikaner is '' kevin krieger '' . 
   when the opponents are adherents of liberal democracy so we should n't reason with revolutionary socialists either , or anti-democratic reactionaries ? 
   especially if you 're from western norway i watched an interview with the singer from sigur ros once . 
  he 'd say two sentences that sounded like gibberish - like something your brain says you 're supposed to understand , but that you just do n't process - and then suddenly one that sounded * exactly * like something i would say in my western norwegian dialect . 
  it was almost a bit surrealistic . 
   want a mcdonalds hamburger ? 
  pay $ 2.50 . 
  i should buy swiss burgers more often . 
  the seemingly total lack of a sensible middle ground between `` sweden 's immigration policy has been a resounding success '' and `` sweden is now a war zone ruled by islamists where everyone is raped four times a day '' kills me . 
  yes , sweden should rethink its refugee policy , focus on assimilation , and take steps to adress the underlying issues that cause crime . 
  no , sweden does not have to close its borders and/or reinstate eugenics . 
  an american one . 
  ^ please ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ kill ^ ^ me , ^ uncle ^ ^ sam . 
   where the us beats everyone else . 
  they do n't , though . 
  the us beats the vast majority of other countries when it comes to median income - a fact that is all the more impressive due to america 's massive population - but not by any means all countries . 
  another guy pointed out that switzerland , norway , and luxembourg are higher , and that 's just in europe . 
  swedes are poor , so this comparison does n't put europe in the glorious light our continent deserves . 
  compare the us to switzerland instead . 
  for all the collective ptsd it gave us , that organ song is hauntingly beautiful . 
  it 's * the * way to use a pipe organ . 
  really ? 
  i did n't know there existed one about the body until this thread , but i was more or less raised by the old guy in il \u00e9tait une fois ... l'homme . 
  borrowed it from the library again and again as a kid , then watched it both in primary and lower secondary school . 
  the swedish one * genuinely * annoys me . 
  norwegian one is just funny, 
  i 'm not directing this towards you specifically , but i feel like a lot of people who go to great lengths in order to explain ( and , sometimes , justify ) eastern european ignorance - '' it 's because of russian imperialism , it 's because of communism '' - do n't have such a nuanced view when it comes to ignorance in other parts of the world . 
  it 's ironic , and sad , when said people brush off * western * imperialism 's role in creating tensions in the middle-east , or * western * imperialism 's role in leaving homophobic laws on the books in africa . 
  east europeans are n't human , confirmed . 
   he thinks that the climate change is a chinese hoax that was just locker-room talk . 
  ** b-but what about her e-mails !, 
  ** and ... 
  her ^ suit ^ ^ pa. . . 
  i mean , her crooked ... ^ ^ ness, 
  from the wikipedia entry on `` no first use '' : `` in 1993 , russia dropped a pledge against first use of nuclear weapons made in 1982 by leonid brezhnev . 
  in 2000 , a russian military doctrine stated that ** russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons `` in response to a large-scale conventional aggression ** '', 
  russia has at its disposal the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world . 
  as if that was n't bad enough , they also have the most gung-ho official policy concerning the use of said weapon . 
   far-far right wing groups i like how differentiating between the far-right and the far - * far * right is now necessary, 
  speak for yourself, 
  good point, 
  i 've already been sent to the gulag , friend, 
  that 's the nicest thing a communist has ever called me, 
  i think liberia is the most aptly named country in the world . 
  simple , and fits the country 's origin as a haven for former slaves ~ ~ who then formed a ruling class and ruled over the inferior liberians ~ ~ . 
  good point, 
  mussolini was kind of a dick . 
  i imagine someone very well might , in a thousand years or so . 
  it matters . 
  i am ashamed of my own incompetence , and will promptly commit sudoku . 
  alabama is a song by neil young , and arizona is the home state of bill clinton . 
  other than that , identical . 
  jesus , finland , calm down, 
  still shit countries to be compared with, 
  thanks . 
  god hjul , grannar !, 
   agree , fascist paramilitaries are hard to beat . 
  luckily that 's not what we see in terrorism in europe not exactly organised fascist * paramilitaries * , but fascists are still behind approximately 100 % of terrorism commited in this country for the past ... well , for the past forever . 
  except for a wacko who planted grenades in the capital during the 60 's , that is . 
   afghani refugee i can vouch for them as friends . 
  wahhabi preachers , on the other hand , can stick a thorny stick up their collective ass . 
  your greenhouse emissions do n't happen to come from salt mines , do they ? 
  if we take trucks away from decent truck-owners , the only truckers left are going to be the bad truck-owners . 
  as a norwegian person , it blows my mind too . 
  i mean , * sweden * ? 
  come on , dutchies . 
  you 're better than that . 
  ... let 's build a bridge ? 
  til swampification turns german nordic . 
  i 'm not your guy , buddy !, 
   the dog, 
  i 've never quite understood how common law systems work . 
  if everything is all based on prior court cases , then where are all the laws defined ? 
  and how in the world would the first legal case in a hypothetical common law country be resolved ? 
  the sharia '' courts '' are used * exclusively * for mediation between consenting parts , are n't they ? 
   islamists have no state of their own depending on how wide your definition of '' state '' is , i can think of a certain islamic ... state . 
  good thing just about the whole world is waging a war on them . 
  i want to partake in a threesome with france and italy . 
  or just stand in a corner and jerk off . 
  that 's fine , too . 
  yes , business-friendly environments are conducive to healthy economies , and healthy economies produce prosperous people . 
  i generally have positive experiences with trusting people .
