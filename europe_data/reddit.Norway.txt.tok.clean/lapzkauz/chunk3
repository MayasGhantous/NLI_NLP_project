   there shoud be a law againt preaching islamic fundamentalism how would you write that law ? 
  restrictions on freedom of speech are not only very controversial ( i would disagree with such a law ) , but hard to enforce . 
  what is fundamentalism , and what is n't ?

  how do you get a swede to laugh on new years eve ? 
  you tell him a joke on christmas day . 
  2017 : after seizing power in a coup d'etat , nigel farage orders every able-bodied resident of britannia to grab an oar , head to the east coast and start rowing . 
  2018 : after months upon months of strenous and neverending rowing , the british isles have now made contact with and formed a land bridge to the former colony known as '' america '' . 
  the second great redcoat invasion ends with a decisive british victory , because you ca n't barrage the farrage . 
   i do n't know if you are genuinely stupid or just an edgy teenager . 
  what if i 'm both ? 
  oh , i do n't disagree with you there . 
  corbyn does n't strike me as the fellow who 'd give up on a cause because it was unpopular , though . 
  that 's his thing , being controversial . 
  says the welshman . 
  i did n't claim to be the majority of british people . 
  i said he 'd have * my * vote . 
   wants the uk to be a republic the guy has my vote, 
  the people there are the worst , though . 
  eh , they 're mostly europeans , americans actually tend to be real bros on here . 
  being a bit generous there , olof . 
  nuclear bombardment , hopefully . 
  hungarians are assholes on reddit , for some weird reason . 
  i bet the germans are to blame !, 
  remember the six billion !, 
  shawarmas are kebabs , though . 
  do you seriously think we take in refugees because we expect to make a profit out of it ? 
  i knew finns were cold , but jeez louise , papa cheese, 
  '' am i being detained ? 
  am i being detained ? 
  i thought this was germa ... oh shit . 
  am i under arrest or am i free to go , officer ? '', 
  exactly . 
  it 's forbidden for asylum applicants to work in norway , which would be fine if processing an application took 48 hours . 
  when the process can take decades , however , it makes a whole bunch of people 's lives a lot less meaningful than they should be . 
  is racism that big of an issue in italy ? 
  i thought the good ol' romans were an open-minded bunch . 
  we have conscription in theory . 
  in practice joining * f\u00f8rstegangstenesta * is voluntary , and even people who * want * to are n't guaranteed to get in . 
   a radical green party wow , thanks rasmus hansson !, 
  so does america , right ? 
  right , guys ? 
  guuys ? 
  that looks like a reputable , decent , objective source . 
  no way those numbers could be wrong . 
  thank you . 
  you 're not alone . 
  * wow . 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  and i thought one commercial break per 30 minutes was annoying . . 
  european honesty is mostly something i 'm a big fan of , but when it comes to openly and honestly being xenophobic . . not so much . 
  donald trump is ridiculed as a racist in the us , but in a country like hungary , where a big wall * is * being built , he 'd sound pretty fucking moderate . 
  hell , he even acknowledged how some immigrants are probably nice people . 
  must be your first visit . 
  thank god for american voices of reason popping up here now and then . 
  not even being snarky . 
  * tumbleweeds and crickets *, 
  during the 70 's , when vietnamese refugees first started pouring into norway , their employment rates started out at a worryingly low level - not unlike how somalis are currently over-represented on the unemployment statistics . 
  today , the norwegian descendants of these vietnamese refugees who escaped a horrible war are * under * - represented on the unemployment statistics . 
  of course , today 's somalis could never achieve the same thing in a generation or two . 
  they 're brown , spooky muslims , and thus unworthy of being given a chance . 
  ... not unlike how the vietnamese refugees were also once referred to as a foreign people , from a foreign land , with foreign traditions and no place in our poor country . 
  reports used in anti-immigration rhetoric are falsified ? 
  color me surprised . 
  ladangster . 
  putin 's approval rates is a good sign that russians in general are extremist and fringe . 
   i grew up in a place were a lot of these fighting bulls are bread portuguese people use * bulls * for their sandwiches ? 
  my country borders finland , and fuck if * i * know what they eat . 
  vodka and lakkupiippu ? 
  haha gypsy jokes xdd xdd xdd, 
  how * dare * you insult our [ beloved ] ( http://www.klikk.no/incoming/img-1176053/binary/original/saetre%20safari%20biks2011042717560_863.jpg ) [ chocolate ] ( http://www.klikk.no/incoming/img-1176024/alternates/landscape_2_1_960/saetre%20ballerina%20nougat%20biks2011042717538_843.jpg ) [ chip ] ( http://bloggfiler.no/tjohey.blogg.no/images/451129-8-1265051666334.jpg ) [ cookies ] ( http://www.klikk.no/incoming/img-1176031/alternates/landscape_2_1_960/saetre%20gjende%20sjokolade%20biks2011042717535_838.jpg ) ? 
  you 've obviously been in the wrong corners of europe !, 
  pretty sure german tourists are everywhere * everywhere * . 
  they 're abundant in norway , and i think i heard as much german as i did spanish when i was climbing the alcazaba in m\u00e1laga a while ago . 
  rip in pepperoni , our american brother < 3, 
  * wipes tears * based putin , winning the war on drugs and european homosex fascism one decadent western website at a time :'), 
  good thing we ai n't socialist , then , 
  now there 's a movie pitch . 
  ~ ~ king ~ ~ [ our most benevolent princeps civitatis , by grace of odin , harald , fifth of his name , rightful king of the norwegians , sami , somalians and polacks and protector of the realm ] ( https://kompanioppvask.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/like-a-bozzz.jpeg ) , takes control of the norwegian government . 
  cue a die hard scenario where either denmark and sweden are given to norway or we pull out one . . * trillion * dollars from the stock market , dooming the world . 
  sounds good to me . 
  what ? 
  says right in the article that someone was stabbed . 
  clearly a muslim plot . 
  god , when will sheeple wake up ?!?!?!!, 
  having an excellent space industry sounds like the perfect way to keep a country floating , with rockets and thrusters and shit, 
  all hail our new brazilian ukrainian overlords !, 
  all hail hue !, 
  man , it 's so weird seeing people having such an adverse reaction to a form of imprisonment deemed cruel , inhuman and degrading by un representatives . 
  pls be venstre . 
  ca n't barrage the farrage !, 
  black people are far more likely to be arrested for something than a white person who does the exact same thing , and they 're also more likely to receive a harsher sentence . 
  what is this , / r/europe defending brown people ? 
  guess the stormfronters are running late today , so we can rule out the possibility of them being german . 
   and i also immigrated here from not euromerinadaustralia muahahahahaha sorry , but that renders your arguments , statements and mere existence invalid . 
  my brown-person scale just exploded . 
  i know it 's probably because my exposure to swedish politics , happenings and history occurs mainly through the tinted glasses of the internet , but holy fuck does sweden appear like a sitcom of a country sometimes , it 's just hilarious . 
  you 've got the goofy neo-nazis showing up in suburbia at 5am with prayer-call-blasters , russian submarines popping up every second week , and a populist political party whose sole reason for being ( in ) famous is making a hot potato that no-one else talks about their main issue . 
  love my neighbors . 
  sweden 's lack of trigger-happy police officers with moustaches and beer bellies makes that clip less entertaining than it could have been :(,
