  nelson mandela and the anc commited acts of terrorism , yet most people view mandela as a hero . 
  the line between freedom fighter and terrorist is a blurry one .

  u wot ? 
   fucked a load of skanks u mirin ? 
  they come to austria , sweden and britain because austria , sweden and britain are examples of countries where other refugees from similar situations and the same countries have settled . 
  it 's sort of a domino effect ; initial refugees settled somewhere else than greece/romania/hungary , and then following refugees that came after * also * settled somewhere else . 
  there 's no doubt that such a highly concentrated and unevenly distributed flow of refugees can strain the system 's sustainability , but it 's also a pretty understandable situation . 
  if northern europe was a war-ravaged shit-hole and i was looking for a place to start over , i 'd be drawn towards places where other people i knew had settled . 
  the pimps !, 
  the pimps in the pimping station !, 
  does n't both population * and * area need to be tiny for it to count as one ? 
  i 'd take it, 
  independence does n't rule out nato membership and/or letting danish forces be stationed in greenland , though . 
  are you dense ? 
  explaining a joke is a bit like dissecting a frog - you get to understand how it works , but it also kills it, 
  yep . 
  [ relevant as ever ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  yeah , but , you know . . turks, 
  no-one wants to move to estonia , we get it . 
  really ? 
  til . 
  guess we must look pretty silly over here with our excessive parading and flagging and brass music boogaloos, 
  i do n't think it has anything to do with honor , that 's just clich\u00e8 . 
  government can influence public opinion/awareness in other ways than censorship . 
  iirc , japanese school curriculums tend to avoid the subject of japans ww2 war crime ( not that we 're much better in the rest of the world ), 
  i 'm telling you , the cute , somewhat senile loving grandpa-thing is all a ruse - he 's really like palpatine , and one day he 'll go full sidious on us : come the next butter crisis , he 'll assume emergency control '' for the good of the people '' , and from then on , it 's all downhill, 
  woah , there 's an idea ... 
  i 'll start a republican revolution , you supply me with guillotines & train militia in the art of french peasant uprisings , and in due time , i 'll tear down the toll barriers so we can import tonnes of french wine !, 
  what is dutch may legally get high !, 
  wilders is coming !,

  welp, 
  harald is an old overprivileged geezer and can suck my shiny non-monarchist balls #gettheguillotinnesout #vivalarevolution, 
  not giving him the martyrdom he wanted is an appropriate punishment if there ever was one , and i think you 'll find the vast , vast majority of people here agree with that . 
  not anymore . 
  now , about that law against offending the king ... 
  yes . 
  as a european and a civilian , lel, 
  we 're not in the eu , we 're under the eu, 
  what , lying ?

  people do that ?

   we 're still much better than the stereotypical muslim . 
  you 're probably much better than the * stereotypical * muslim , but that 's not saying a lot , is it ? 
  from your bellitling attitude towards complete strangers , however , it 's quite clear that the * real * muslims i know are much better than the stereotype about moldavians i just formed based on you . 
  i picked treecko grass pride worldwide, 
  they can . 
  i suspect that might be the case , yeah . 
  says a lot about this place when there are enough people who really * do * go '' muslims herp herp '' that you ca n't joke about it without a redundant '' / s '' at the end, 
  it originally * did * have an / s , but / s are really fucking stupid because they take the fun out of sarcasm . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congo_free_state#humanitarian_disaster agree with your main point though , far too little african history in our school curriculums, 
  i can live with that, 
  note to self : stop by finland when randy, 
   the nordic model of socialism ... capitalism , basically, 
  speaking from my own experiences , we 're not * that * anti-social . 
  less likely than an italian or a spaniard to strike up casual conversation with a stranger , sure , but no even close to the level that the stereotype suggests . 
  i 'll smile at someone if i make eye contact , i 'll engage in merry banter if i 'm standing behind someone in a queue , but no , i 'm not going to sit down next to a stranger on an empty bus or demand you tell me your life story because i have n't seen you before . 
  there 's certainly a lot of variations in nordic culture , though . 
  semi-rural norway is n't urban denmark , or urban norway for that matter . 
  finally the bokm\u00e5l-speakers admit that they 've really been ~ ~ speaking ~ ~ writing what 's basically danish all along, 
  dude . 
  * dude * . 
  * damnit * , they 're on to us !, 
  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 ? 
  agreed, 
  yep . 
  i seriously doubt even hitler would order your death just for waking him at the wrong time . 
   because the last man who had woken stalin up was purged . 
  i knew stalin was a very bad man , but * come on * . 
  that 's just ridiculously , almost cartoonishly evil , like a literal supervillain . 
  most importantly , we need a temporary ban on toddlers entering the united states , until we figure out what the hell is going on . 
  we have to build a wall . 
   people still can not talk openly about this issue for fear is being called racists . 
  oh , come on . 
  it 's amazing how often this claim is repeated considering how utterly ridiculous it is . 
  immigration , islam , refugees and all the other good stuff that / r/europe ( ean ) likes to complain about are some of the most hotly debated topics in european politics . 
  hardly a day goes by without an op-ed about said topics being on the front page of the biggest newspapers , and a certain government party here in norway certainly is n't afraid to blame islam for whatever problem they want to blame them for . 
  why not ? 
  you should try it sometime . 
   which may not be a sexy accent you 're kidding , right ? 
  finnglish is beautiful . 
  and troms\u00f8 is in the north . 
  the southern half of the country , where the vast majority of people live , is quite a lot warmer . 
  there are `` r `` s in chinese , but they 're pronounced somewhat like if i 'd say `` sh '' softly . 
  so `` ren '' is pronounced more like `` shen '' than the guttural `` r '' i use when speaking norwegian . 
  not a perfect explanation , but yeah . 
  * o-oh say , can you see ^ e ^ ^ e. . . *, 
  * morgan freeman 's soothing voice : * in today 's episode of ** ozlo : going dutch ** , jens and the rest of the gang has a collective mental breakdown when they realize that the dutch laissez-faire position on marijuana * does n't * mean that they can smoke the ganja freely behind bars - not even on 4/20 . 
  with their sole reason for accepting a transfer to the netherlands now being a moot point - and the tvs in their new-found home being filled with people who speak the indecipherable gibberish called '' dutch '' - the prisoners find themselves at their wit 's end . 
  * cue some bitchin ' guitar riffs and a totally rad intro * that does it .
