   many finns are american even . 
  what, 
  absolutely thavage, 
  you dun goofed . 
  it 's just italian tipping culture . 
  you probably work a bit more than me , though , so i think you come out on top financially , 
  as said , i work part-time - no more than 6 hours or so a week , and that 's divided between two employers . 
  so i earn * just * above the minimal taxable amount and pay around 10 % in taxes . 
  but guys i eat lefsuh and small-a-holy and pick on the local swedes whenever i can i 'm as norwegian they come `` uffda '' lol get it ??? 
  that 's norwegian if you were n't aware, 
  fokin gr8 banter m8 i r8 8 out of 5, 
  [ heh ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/9ewnzgnjvmig4/giphy.gif ), 
  that flair is n't fooling me , olof . 
  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 ? 
  norwegian part of you ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  so you 've got like , a conjoined twin ? 
   the norwegian economy is in the process of collapsing . 
  these stereotypes are depressing . 
  no it is n't . 
  not by any stretch . 
  there seems to be this prevalent hyperbolical idea that we 're somehow standing on the verge of a total financial apocalypse \u00e1 la the great depression . 
  the fact of the matter is that our economy is n't just not regressing , it 's growing . 
  yes , it * is * growing slower than the past few years - during which it fared even better than we imagined just a decade or two ago - and yes , there are some serious challenges ahead - biggest of all being the fact that we ** have ** to diversify our economy - but * come on * . 
  we 're sitting on a sovereign oil fund worth astronomical amounts of money , and unlike other countries with similar funds , we 've managed to excercise a modicum of restraint when it comes to handling it . 
  bet you wish you had those , huh ? 
  we do n't have a minimum hourly wage . 
  and yet here i am , an un-unionised part-time washer making approx . 
  23 $ an hour . 
  you matter , romania . 
  you hear me ? 
  you * matter * . 
  ... again , she did n't call everyone who 's not against `` mass immigration '' venomous . 
  p ( l ) easant dream, 
  yeah , just * a bit * conservative . 
  the ones that matter , anyway . 
  she does n't say that anyone against `` mass immigration '' is venomous . 
  she calls * \u00d3rban * venomous , and there are many worse words i would have used about him . 
  there 's even a synth operating the artillery coordination room . 
   greece is also hard to invade can confirm source : played arma 3, 
  such is life in finland ... ? 
  til afro-slovakian beats are groovy, 
  barack is n't that black , though . 
  maybe they 'd just think he was a tanned slovenian . 
  if they 're second-generation , then they 're * from * norway , but usually identify as pakistani-norwegian , yes . 
  not 22 000 from pakistan , in other words . 
   everybody has seen black people at least in movies . 
  '' what is eddie murphy doing in slovakia ? '', 
  wh ... what, 
  eh , getting rich in the us is very feasible . 
  it 's just that there is n't a safety net to help you on the way there in the same way it is in much of europe . 
  22 000 from pakistan , or 22 000 whose parents are from pakistan ? 
   fuck you . 
  enjoy your ban !, 
  a knife or a * noif * , in other words, 
  sorry , i do n't speak turkish . 
  to be honest spaniards , greeks , turks , arabs and berbers all look about the same to my eyes . 
  yes we do . 
  thankfully . 
  korean . 
  it 's a silly tradition . 
  all those '' \u00f6 '' s and '' \u00e4 '' s look swedish , funnily enough , but tr\u00f8ndish is n't really * that * hard to understand , it 's just unique . 
  the really fucking weird dialects in norway are in the inner south . 
  hope you 're referring to haugesundsk and not sunnhordlandsk , living here without knowing the language ca n't be easy  so whereabouts in sunnhordland ? 
  stor ` n ? 
  that does it . 
  we 're taking you back , f\u00e9lagi . 
  off the top of my head i can place south africa ( plus lesotho and swaziland ) , namibia , botswana , mozambique , zimbabwe , madagascar , uganda , dem . 
  republic of congo , burundi & rwanda ( possibly mixed those last two up ) , gabon , ethiopia , eritrea , somalia , djibouti , ghana , south sudan & sudan , morocco & western sahara , egypt , libya , tunisia , and algeria . 
  so it 's mostly in western africa i 'm blank , around burkina faso , cote d'ivore , gambia and senegal . 
  so what you 're implying here is that swedes are n't able to go out in sub-zero weather ? 
  bahahaha, 
  ska du him \u00e5 sj\u00e5 p\u00e5 tv haugal\u00e6nd te klokk\u00e5 tri ell\u00e5r sorry , but it 's not often you get to make fun of the haugesund dialect on such a large subreddit . 
  seize the memes of production 2 . 
  i 'm agreeing with you . 
  that 's what i sa - - wait . 
  * you cheeky bastard * ... 
  loving denmark and acknowledging that their form of '' speech '' is indeed ridiculous to say the least are n't mutually exclusive , though . 
  no parties in norway support putin , but i guess that might be partly because we do n't have any significant far-right parties . 
  what 's sverigedemokraternas stance ? 
   making the king and queen sound ridiculous . 
  so . . they do n't speak dutch from before ? 
  huehuehue ^ hue ^ ^ hue ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ notsorry i understood '' baby '' and the king 's '' hallo '' ing , so my dutch must be coming along nicely . 
  what the hell did i just see, 
  not really surprising , considering . . you know , communism . 
  do n't know how things are in sweden and finland , but a sizeable minority of norwegians - at least the * vocal * minority that also happens to bash immigrants and/or muslims at any given opportunity - seem to love putin for his strongman-style leadership . 
  '' yeah , putin go show those isis fucks ! '', 
  '' yeah , putin go show those american fucks ! '', 
  '' yeah , putin go show those [ insert fuck here ] fucks ! '', 
  sounds sort of fast to my ears , too . 
  there 's a fair amount of gypsy beggars and trinket sellers from romania here , but most romanians i 've ~ ~ made ~ ~ met are skilled immigrants/family thereof , and great people to boot . 
   rain , fog and darkness . 
  sounds pretty metal !, 
  hah , i 'm afraid to say your italian winters sound eerily similar to the ones i 've experienced here in skyrim . 
  this year there 's even barely been any slush , just rain . 
  * hiking my sides, 
  eh , i find the winter to be a beautiful time of the year . 
  it 's beautiful in a sort of quiet , snow-white , moody and thought-evoking way , but still beautiful - there 's just something special about walking in crispy , white snow with cold winter air in your nose and quiet all around . 
  and then there 's the yuletide celebration slapped in the middle of it , which helps light things up ( literally and metaphorically ) . 
  i might not be the best person to judge seeing as i 'm depressed regardless of season , though .
