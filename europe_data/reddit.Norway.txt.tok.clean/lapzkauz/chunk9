  hahah , that picure sums up how i imagine the '' finnish mentality '' is . 
  i 'd be a terrible finn with my low alcohol consumption . 
  yeah , they tend to be experts on legal matters . 
  it 's hilarious when they insist that according to the holy constitution ^ ^ tm all politicans that are n't brave frpers are guilty of treason ( because muh eu , muh muslims , muh asylum invasion ) and should be sent to penal camps on svalbard . 
   its not -40 c. 
  nor is norway . 
  hell , i ca n't remember the last time i 've been in weather below * -5 c * . 
   yeah probably . 
  but i spent 2 weeks there this summer , and it was truly amazing . 
  so thanks to those 2 weeks , you can safely say that ireland should be higher than all the other european countries you * have n't * spent 2 weeks in ? 
  yeah , no, 
  the standard right-wing moron response to absolutely everything : '' but what about the old people what about ** our ** people '', 
  you can have a mountain , if we get a mountain of liberal politicians that 'll legalise weed , prostitution and other delightful debauchery . 
  deal ? 
  '' the sky mountain '' ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy lmao, 
  i 've seen [ danish skits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uaocglfav4 ) where norwegians are characterised as hilariously ecstatic all the time . 
  finns are the only scandinavians ( and you 're not even scandinavian ) that are stereotypically sad as far as i 've heard . 
  high-powered , automatic assault dogs !, 
  geez , world , are you even trying ? 
  it seems you 're trivialising violence against children . 
  you do n't hit a child , period . 
  using `` tradition '' as an excuse is pathetically backwards . 
  thank you , based winland . 
  we nordics sure do love our guns . 
  absolutely savage, 
  i mean , nynorsk * is * pretty swell , it 's not that . 
  it 's also a whole lot closer to the way we speak norwegian on the west coast - which is similar to icelandic in an interesting way in that it 's usually not , but then there are some sentences or parts of sentences i hear in icelandic that sound almost identical to how i 'd say something in my particular dialect . 
  case in point : [ this interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p42thdiuaic ) with j\u00f3nsi . 
  it starts with some barely intelligible icelandic where i can * sort of * make out the meaning of the sentences , and then around 0:30 he says something that could just as easily be someone from my town speaking ( '' lika \u00e5 komma heim , med alt ditta show [ ... ] '' ) . 
  it 's * eerily * similar . 
  dropping those dank '' \u00f0 '' s and '' \u00de '' s from norwegian were the stupidest decisions ever . 
  i wish we still spoke viking , too . 
  i 'm rooting for you , estonia , and you 're catching up pretty god damn quickly . 
  you need to work on your attitudes , though , as both xenophobia and homophobia seem to be prevalent ( at least that was my impression after watching a documentary about anti-lgbt marches in estonia ) . 
  i want beautiful italian women :( time to start working on that longboat i 've been thinking of making , i guess . 
  we gave the jews israel , so the least we could do is give the romani . . shit , i do n't know , monaco ? 
  ~ ~ sweden ~ ~ east norway ? 
  might just watch it , then . 
   italian pov film set in northern africa . 
  or any other of these : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:north_african_campaign_films ? 
  i have n't gotten any further than the fourth episode of the first season . 
  caesar has crossed the rubicon and pompey escaped the city , so the series actually takes place during the most interesting time possible - the fall of the republic and the rise of the empire . 
  ancient rome . 
  i would give my left testicle for a new season of rome . 
  or a proper show about the viking age . 
  vikings ( the history channel one ) is shit , in my humble opinion . 
  german , japanese , italian . 
  the axis pov in general . 
  unsere m\u00fctter and letters from iwo jima are both great . 
  they could spice it up with a dank mlg montage of simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 noscoping hundreds of russian plebs . 
  i 'd watch it . 
  the sami have been planning their revenge for centuries . 
  no more will they stand idly by while politicians in oslo dictate finnmark 's policies . 
  their ancestors deaths must be avenged , tenfold . 
  on the sixth of february 2016 , the speaker of the sami parliament announces a state of emergency in samiland , and that he intends to establish a galactic empire ruled by and for sami people , with him as the sole emperor . 
  ** the samipire strikes back , in cinemas q1 2016 **, 
  malm\u00d6 is in sk\u00c5ne and the muslamics obviously want to separate sk\u00c5ne into its own muslamic communist republic, 
   a set sized font . 
  comic sans , obviously . 
  you 're prostituting yourself out for cheeseburgers again , are n't ya ? 
  man 's got ta eat . 
  might as well eat some royal dick . 
  if the prosecutor convinces the judge that the defendant 's * intent * was to publish an anti-erdogan facebook minion meme , i would n't have any problems supporting a temporary reinstatement of capital punishment . 
  similar laws are still on the books in norway . 
  insulting the king is a criminal offense , and one with severe punishments at that . 
  that being said , fuck the king . 
  i never knew turkish memes were so fresh . 
  that right there , that 's the cream of memes . 
  it 's art . 
   it is as wrong to call them islamists for that as it is wrong to call breivik a christian extremist . 
  it 's * not * wrong to call breivik a christian extremist ; that 's exactly what he is . 
  anti-muslim , anti-establishment , white nationalist and christian extremist, 
  i bet you did n't see it when a european christian blew up part of oslo and then shot up a political youth camp , either . 
  laws against mankinis , nazi memorabilia and niqabs are all retarded . 
  someone should wear all three for shits and giggles . 
  i did n't even realize the first one before after i 'd read my own post . 
  a hundred hours of fallout 4 after one week of it being out has fucked me up . 
  romanian humor sounds like my type of humor . 
  i 'm fairly sure any bearded person with a tan could easily get themselves tackled by airport security by yelling * anything * in arabic . 
  '' i won the fucking lottery , woohoo '' !, 
  '' oh shit i forgot to turn off the oven ! '', 
  '' has anyone seen my son , shaun ? 
  hello ? '', 
  hilariously stupid , and stupidly hilarious . 
  / r/imgoingtohellforthis have some of the toppest keks , but they 're also weirdly paranoid of the '' sjw islamist feminazi brigades '', 
  romanian nightclub prank gone wrong gone sexual gone sofloantonio, 
  welp . 
  just noticed i 'm retarded . 
  great idea !, 
  let 's call it the special european cooperative intelligence entity , or spectre for short . 
  we 're in / r/europe . 
  i thought an `` s '' would be unnecessary . 
  i just discovered eodm thanks to this whole mess , and their music is pretty dope . 
  thanks , daesh !, 
  do n't be an egotistical cunt , though ; * do * stand up for others . 
  as benjamin franlin put it : `` first they came for the socialists , and i did not speak out -- because i was not a socialist . 
  then they came for the trade unionists , and i did not speak out -- because i was not a trade unionist . 
  then they came for the jews , and i did not speak out -- because i was not a jew . 
  then they came for me -- and there was no one left to speak for me . '', 
  german in general sounds badass .
