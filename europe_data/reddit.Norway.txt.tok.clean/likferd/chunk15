  i do n't understand `` 3 . 
  reform for national tv/radio '' . 
  why would it pass ? 
  tv as a medium is dying . 
  the proposed change would take a fee you can avoid ( by using netflix for example ) , and transforms it to a fee you ca n't avoid ( every household must pay , no matter what ) . 
  only an idiot would vote yes to that , considering what will change in the near future with internet based entertainment . . 
  but maybe i 'm biased . . 
  i have n't had a tv subscription in years . . and i have n't missed it either . 
  i would be very cross if i got a hefty bill for something i never use . 
  i 'm sure you do . 
  does not change the fact that every single fat person on this planet is eating more then they burn . 
  and that the only `` cure '' is to either eat less or to be more active . 
  what you linked is merely a huuuuge list of excuses people can tell themselves to justify why they are not in control of their own food consumption . 
  none of those things influence the amount of calories going in . 
  the only thing influencing calories going in , is your spoon or fork hand . 
  first of all , they are n't thin automatically . 
  either they eat way less or healthier than you think , or they are more active than you think . 
  probably a combination secondly , you probably eat more then you think you do . 
  there is no such thing as calorie free food . 
  if you are serious about losing weight , start [ counting calories ] ( https://www.myfitnesspal.com/ ) . 
  it 's a bit of a chore in the beginning , but there is no way to lie to yourself when you write down every calorie you eat or drink . 
  i guarantee that if you try religiously counting calories for a week or so , you will get a revelation . 
  pun intended , 
   i blame their parents and thank mine for the genetics there is no such thing . 
  fatness is a lifestyle problem , no matter how much fat people try to convince the world of `` conditions '' , `` genes '' and other reasons why it 's impossible for them to lay off the cheesy poofs or take a walk . 
  and what 's the probability of being killed by an arab terrorist attack in europe ? 
  just keep us out of it , and you can take in as many economic refugees as you wish . 
  had a similar thing happen with my tank when i was in the army , although luckily it was noticed before it ignited . 
  it 's most likely heat developing due to a pressure loss/leak in the transmission oil , it first smokes like crazy and eventually the oil catches fire . 
  it was very much a sleeping paragraph indeed . 
  in fact it was meant to be removed already in 2005 , when the parliament updated a bunch of laws . 
  it was delayed until know however , because of bureaucracy and implementation of new it systems . 
  so the afghan military and police death toll in afghanistan increases each year because the taliban is getting weaker ? 
  and american , until they started pulling out . 
  the drop in casualties coincides with the withdrawal of soldiers , not a lack of taliban activity . 
  politically , yes . 
  but in 2001 , their fighting force was a few thousand men . 
  now it is 60 000 strong . 
  in the same time frame , al-qaeda has gone from obscurity to ruling vast sunni populated areas in the middle east . 
  and that is called progress . 
  are you serious ? 
  the taliban is [ much stronger now than in 2001 ] ( http://www.voanews.com/content/despite-massive-taliban-death-toll-no-drop-in-insurgency/1866009.html ) take a look at the [ afhgan death toll ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_afghan_security_forces_fatality_reports_in_afghanistan ) . 
  or [ american soldiers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_military_casualties_in_the_war_in_afghanistan ) . 
  i do n't see any increasingly disorganized stragglers that are unable to coordinate attacks , do you ? 
  and we sure have killed a lot of them . 
  i 'm sure this will lead to less terror indeed . 
  how can it be poorly worded when they are literally writing the word `` homeopathic '' in the legislation ? 
  it could n't be clearer actually . 
  if it 's some weird attempt at sarcasm , let me just say that sarcasm in legislations would probably be the only thing that is worse than snake oil . 
  well , they basically have two choices . 
  either lose their certification over bullshit , losing quite a lot of money in the process . 
  or knowingly letting their sick fish suffer using ineffective treatments . 
  a lot of places do n't have a proper government , but that does not equal asylum rights . 
  it 's a bit like mexico . 
  there is open armed warfare with gangs like in somalia , but mexicans ca n't just seek asylum in the us . 
  you either need to be a proper un vetted refugee , like a syrian coming from a refugee camp , but then you simply `` win the lottery '' and get a proper plain ticket to europe . 
  or you need to a have a valid reason for asylum , i.e your own personal life or well being need to be in danger . 
  simply living in a poor or dangerous country is not enough . 
  the majority of the ones who come to norway is actually rejected . 
  but the whole process is slow and idiotic , often taking years . 
  a huge part does not . 
  they come from poor countries like eritrea and somalia . 
  they do n't flee from war , but from poverty . 
  unfortunately for them , that does not qualify for either refugee status or asylum . 
  then they come to europe , gets denied , and is shipped back . 
  or they just run off and become criminals . 
  oh , and a few percent of them die on the journey , because europe is afraid to say no . 
  it 's `` funny '' how fleeing is more dangerous than staying . 
  you do n't need to send them \\* back \\* , you just need to keep them from reaching europe . 
  just like australia did . 
  i 'm sure it 's possible to find some place to process them that is not in europe . 
  and is it more aligned to your ethics to send someone on a fool 's errand that will kill a huge percent of them , that only exists to line the pockets of unscrupulous middle men ? 
  legal proceedings against british companies drilling oil in british waters ? 
  good luck , argentina . 
  ~ ~ and yet , while only 22 % of norwegians answered they believed in any god in 2010 , and 29 % claimed to be atheist , we are expected to believe over 75 % of norwegians are religious today . ~ ~ edit : yeah i read it wrong . 
  the norwegian numbers can be around 50 % non-religious , which makes it plausible with a huge margin of error , considering the abysmal 22 % who believed in a god on the eurobarometer ( how can you be religious without believing in any god ) . 
  but the swedish numbers are still way off compared to norway . 
  they should be within ~ 5-10 % off each other . 
  i do n't believe the swedish numbers at all . 
  what on earth are these numbers based on ? 
  on the [ eurobarometer ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf ) poll in 2010 ( page 204 ) , 34 % of swedes answered they were atheists , compared to 29 % of norwegians . 
  not a 25 % to 50 % difference as this thing claims . 
  unless 40 % of sweden suddenly turned atheist in the last 4-5 years . . 
  according to [ lego ] ( http://stores.lego.com/en-us/stores ) , there is only one official store in scandinavia , in denmark . 
  there is a ton of them in the us and canada though . . 
   all joking aside , poland has a better military than germany . 
  who is better in a strictly professional term is hard to say , but there is no doubt the polish armed forces have a lot more political and financial backing ( relatively ) , then the bundeswehr does . 
  the german army is constantly underfunded for its size , causing the sales and mothballing of existing military equipment and slowdowns and halts in new purchases . 
  well , of course they can . 
  they are europe 's third largest economy . 
  they can negotiate a better deal , because they are several times more important to the eu economy then we are . 
  it 's pretty damn stupid to think the eu can freeze out the uk without at the same time shooting the eu in the foot . 
  or in the first place wish to do such a thing . 
  yeah , just like switzerland is a poor country . 
   ( also increasing a 5 % tax by 300 % makes it a 20 % tax ) me no smart at math :(, 
  this tells me absolutely nothing without context . 
  if previously the lowest income was taxed 5 % , and it was increased to 15 % , that 's a 300 % increase . 
  if the highest was previously taxed 45 % , and it was increased to 49 % , that 's a 9 % increase . 
  there is nothing unreasonable about either scenario . 
  you ca n't increase already heavy taxation by the same percent amount as the lower tax brackets .
