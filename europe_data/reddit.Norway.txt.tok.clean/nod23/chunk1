i believe we have about the same number of polish builders in norway . 
  svalbard was n't universally recognized as norwegian or indeed claimed by norway until modern times ( 20th century ) . 
  the iso code is rather misleading , most websites and people wrongly believe that they are only given to proper countries . 
  svalbard has special status under international law and that 's why it received its own iso code - but it 's clearly a part of norway in every regard ( undisputed ) . 
  svalbard and jan mayen ( sj ) are separate administrative units under norwegian law . 
  jan mayen is administered by [ the mainland ] county of nordland , while svalbard has its own governor that reports to the [ norwegian ] dept of justice in oslo . 
  i know , but they also live in syria . 
  i 'm saying there are probably assyrians amongst the new syrian refugees . 
  hehe , that 's why you go to the uk !, 
  yeah , that does n't make sense ( giraffe ) . 
  i 'm saying that the percentage is much higher , because if you just measure `` syrians '' arriving now it does n't take into account the fact that the `` assyrians '' are already numerous in sweden . 
  you have to add them together to get a proper understanding of the syrian minority in sweden . 
  i think that 's noteworthy . 
  it 's not something special , you can have it too  no doubt . 
  remember , we re-built after wwii , just like you had to . 
  you just have to rebuild after decades of soviet rule and trauma . 
   but it 's not really hard to became economically independent . 
  what ? 
  sorry , but that is complete nonsense . 
  it is very , very hard for exactly the reasons you quoted ( trade balance/resources ) . 
  it does n't even work if they have oil resources ; see `` dutch disease '' and the gulf states . 
   iceland is selling pretty much a large amount of fished so will greenland . 
  iceland is not comparable with greenland . 
  you 're comparing two very different societies and economies . 
  iceland is about a lot more than just fishing today ; they have everything from tourism to finance and it industries . 
  they also have a vastly better organized state and society ; the education system is great , the health care system works , infrastructure is in place , etc. 
  you ca n't get that over night without massive wealth/investment . 
  is it minimum wage though ? 
  my family had a company there , that has since been sold . 
  it was paying above average wages . 
  we hired for skill . 
   i would love an older cousin country who spoke weird ... and had an awesome economy right on our border you just described denmark/norway/sweden !, 
   it nearly is now that 's something i find hard to believe ? 
  the numbers i 've read earlier lead me to believe that was impossible without some new , major economic changes . 
  see chinese investments in other words . 
   from danish perspective independent greenland is a lost territory interestingly , we [ norway ] tried to keep it , as it was originally our colony . 
  we lost it when denmark-norway lost the war ( 1814 ) . 
  we even went to the hague later , to take/keep the eastern part . 
  ah , good old maslow . 
  yes , i believe that 's exactly what they 're describing  the article even quotes : '' [ at $ 75k ] ... individual temperament and life circumstances have much more sway over their lightness of heart than money '' . 
  well , no , i did n't say that they would  i just said they exist as nations , with some legal control over their territory , but far from sovereign . 
  greenland might become fully sovereign , if they can make it * without * danish funding . 
  what ? 
  i 'm afraid i do n't quite get your comment . 
  i 'm just saying there was a lot of syriac people there already . 
  a natural draw . 
  hmm , at least they would be the first * sovereign * native american nation . 
  there are a few ethnic danes there as well . 
  the [ first nations of canada ] ( https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/dam/dam-inter-hq-ldc/staging/images-images/ldc_brief_notea_fig1_1398255599781_eng.jpg ) , and the us are also technically [ nations with territory ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/bia-map-indian-reservations-usa.png ) . 
  they just signed/had taken away most of their sovereign powers . 
  is n't that what we 're doing now ? 
  we 've set up so many factories in the baltics ...  the number of lithuanians in my country is only second to polish . 
  there are fewer latvians though . 
  especially finland i imagine , since they 're like cousins . 
  estonians probably work well with/in finland for lower wages . 
  sweden is more distant , at least if you disregard the swedish-ethnic finns . 
  hmm , $ 75k does according to [ this time article ] ( http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html ), 
  yeah , i figured . 
  there 's no native population in svalbard at all . 
  they 're all from either mainland norway , or foreign citizens from countries that are parties to the svalbard treaty ( like russians , thai , chinese etc ) . 
  most only stay there for a few years . 
  you did n't include jan mayen or bear island up there , that 's the other half of the `` sj '' iso code . 
  those islands are also empty of natives , just some radar , army and weather stations . 
  no-way . 
  it 's literally norway . 
  no autonomy at all , it 's even subject to administration from a mainland county . 
  there 's an iso code ( sj ) , for historical reasons , but it 's all norway today . 
  you might be confused by the svalbard treaty ? 
  it 's a real shame danish tv/radio could n't be bothered to include norway or iceland . 
  just because we do n't ~ ~ submit ~ ~ report to brussels and eurostat ... / goes back to swimming in petro-dollars, 
  that 's why ngos from my country [ and the eu 's aid arm ] build housing in lebanon : [ housing refugees in lebanon ] ( http://www.nrc.no/?did=9185407 ), 
  remember to add the pre-existing , pre-war assyrian population in sweden !, 
  wtf ? 
  svalbard is not a country !, 
  while i do n't know the exact details , we did regulate the applicability . 
  as such it extended to several forms of collaboration , but quisling was a clear cut case . 
  under our legal system legislation may be used analogously . 
   yeltsin was n't that smart , but he knew that and did n't try to outsmart anyone . 
  i have always wondered if the russian people would have been better of if [ the coup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_soviet_coup_d'%c3%a9tat_attempt ) * had * succeeded . 
  sure it would have taken longer to transition to `` democracy '' , but maybe the resources would n't have been stolen as easily ? 
  that 's amazing !, 
  i 've never read something that honest , bitter and amusing at the same time !, 
  no , that 's not correct . 
  i wonder where you got the notion . 
  it literally sounds incredible to my ears ; preposterous for a country ruled by law . 
  our constitution forbids retroactive laws . 
  norway abolished the death penalty in 1902 for civilians , the exception for treason during war remained . 
  the last execution happened in 1948 . 
  the exception for treason was finally removed in 1979 . 
  europe as a whole [ abolished the death penalty in 1983 . 
  ] ( http://hub.coe.int/what-we-do/human-rights/death-penalty ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's implying a land war in norway ? 
  you should have driven further north or west , you would have seen even more impressive scenery  however , i do enjoy driving up that way as well , it just gets [ even ] better after lillehammer in my opinon . 
   drive around with eight inches of snow on the road it 's a mandatory part of the driver 's ed testing performed by the norwegian public roads administration . 
  you have to pass an obstacle course on ice , or during summer the same on a oil-coated surface . 
  on the other hand all nordic kids learn to walk on ice ; it 's a particular kind of gait ( waddle ) you can see during winter . 
  it 's why we do n't fall over , 
  hehe , that 's true , it 's just not precise , 
  yeah , it 's a nice area for weekends and holidays . 
  many norwegians have cabins around the area , but that applies to just about every valley and mountain in norway , hehe .
