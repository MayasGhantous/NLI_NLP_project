  you could submit to icelandic rule under ancestral rules ? 
  just an illustration of the potential conflicts with the original natives of sochi and the region ( tartars ) . 
  they are not happy about the crimea annexation either . 
  it 's almost as if they do n't want to join the eu . 
  that 's a bit * too * creative . 
  russia does n't have a border over 3 continents . 
  two is enough . 
  or does ireland border the us ? 
  where do you draw the line [ in the sea ] ? 
  we export [ missiles ] ( http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/norwegian-contract-launches-nsm-missile-03417/ ) , [ gun systems ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crows#suppliers ) and [ ammunition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raufoss_mk_211 ), 
   remember what it was like here before the eu ? 
  i wish people understood why we awarded the nobel peace prize to the eu ... nato and the eu !, 
  there is plenty of action in saudi arabia itself ... 
  they 've cracked down and are very keen on keeping it quiet . 
   iran is much more peaceful , ethnically clean , wot ? 
  iran is anything but ethnically uniform . 
   we 're the only existing country without a known founding date you could ask us  we had to wait a few centuries for you guys to get your act together . 
  of course , then you kicked our asses ... 
  do n't we know it ... :(, 
  real peace beats fake war . 
   essentially be a client state of some other country here we go again . 
  tell us how much you pay for * our * security . 
  ( i look at my tax receipt ... ), 
  interestingly , you could say that it 's ruled by the male demographic ? 
  i guess you were rather thinking about the unemployed youth demographic ? 
  or the minority of extremists ? 
  sochi 's warm now , right ? 
  has romania started receiving syrian refugees ? 
  iceland is only slightly closer to continental europe than to mainland north america . 
  the mid-atlantic ridge is right there . 
  we consider ourselves europeans , just like you brother , we just do n't want to be part of your club . 
  yes , hehe , i 'm sure if * north koreans * headed the board the us would be ranked much lower !, 
   people who are of rich , western countries yeah , because they ca n't possibly be objective ? 
  conflicts , wars and uprisings are numbers - not a racist agenda . 
  your understanding of the `` problem '' is very tabloid . 
  unemployment is a bigger problem , it 's not muslims or others races themselves that 's problematic . 
  i 'm not a big fan of extra-european immigration or muslims , but i can read . 
  riots limited to neighborhoods , in some cities . 
  it was n't a civil war . 
  fun fact : iceland was empty , until norwegian vikings settled there . 
  we stole celtic women to populate the place ...

  so peaceful you were forgotten about . 
  true peace !, 
  hey , you just reduced our score by one point !, 
  what are you doing ? 
  stop creating conflicts with our neighbors , you racist !, 
  hey , it made for a great joke about our overlords !, 
  yeah , i just wanted to make fun of the scary , secret fta business , 
  yeah , but more in russia than the us , so it does fit with the map ... 
   eua european union of america ? 
  so * that 's * what they 're planning on doing with the new secret fta !, 
  i do n't know there is some truth to it . 
  there are more conflicts in russia than the us . 
  see chechnya and other parts around caucasus , georgia , < removed tatars  , crimea etc. 
  the us has social problems and gangs in the big cities , russia has wars , mafia and domestic terrorists . 
  riots in sweden ? 
  plural ? 
  since it 's per capita it probably * would n't * increase germany wealth by much . 
  - few people + lots of money = rich/per capita - many people + lots of money = less rich/per capita, 
  these negotiations happen regularly between norway , iceland , the faroes and the eu . 
  we exchange quotas . 
  joining the eu ? 
  it 's about as likely as norway joining - as in never . 
  we like to protect our [ marine ] resources , for many reasons , and have done a lot better than the eu nations ( i.e. 
  healthy stocks ) . 
  that 's why the eu is asking to fish in * our * waters ... 
  at least it gets the point across ; people can bicycle in copenhagen all year long . 
  you guys barely get snow   never did think there was a gender imbalance it 's [ apparently ] all about men in spandex , racing through the streets , in some american cities . 
  it 's for the select few who do it for exercise and sport - rather than normal transportation to work , school and kindergarten , 
  that 's very true , hehe . 
  bergen and the whole west coast is known for being milder and wetter . 
  the southern coast is known for idyllic seaside villages of white houses and picket fences etc. 
  the contrast is expressed culturally as well , 
  [ norway is actually not that logical in terms of temperature ( cold map ) . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8iqxl7j ) the gulf stream heats up the coast and makes it very , very wet in fact ... 
  the inland is cold and drier . 
  this video sort of explains [ why they did n't need a metro in copenhagen . 
  why do n't you just quote * exactly * what i wrote ? 
   it 's a bit like saying the queen runs the uk ... 
  yes , and he is ** not ** the leader of nz ... mateparae is the governor-general of new zealand , the representative of the monarch of new zealand . 
  the governor-general acts as the queen 's vice-regal representative in new zealand and is viewed by some as the de facto head of state . 
  however , the prime minister is the actual leader . 
  do you see my point ? 
  the danish `` far right '' is nothing like the far right in hungary or greece for example . 
  [ the prime minister ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prime_minister_of_new_zealand ) of new zealand [ is very white ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/john_key_2013_%28edit%29.jpg ) . 
  to be clear : the guy in the photo , mr. mateparae , is ** not ** the prime minister . 
  furthermore , new zealand is [ still a monarchy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monarchy_of_new_zealand ) . 
  the crown is * the foundation * of the executive , legislative and judicial branches of the new zealand government . 
  only for countries in the eu  if you leave you 'll be competing in another league !, 
  3,3 % according to statistics norway ( official ) , [ data published 22 may 2014 ( in english ) ] ( http://www.ssb.no/en/arbeid-og-lonn/statistikker/akumnd ), 
  yeah , i 've seen that one , hehe . 
  it 's quite entertaining , have you seen the flashbang training ? 
   the only net gain is the friends i made there . 
  i think that 's what most of us end up with , 
  yeah , i imagine most guys remember the good parts now ; or just the fact that it was something * different * from the everyday lives we have now . 
  writing emails just is n't the same as firing a g3 rifle , 
  hehe , exactly . 
  it 's not that unique in europe . 
  here in norway most men are eligble for conscription , afterwards it 's not unusual to end up as a reservist in the home guard as well .
