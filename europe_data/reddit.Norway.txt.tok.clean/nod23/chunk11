  as reservists we keep our g3 rifles , or possibly hk416 now , at home for as long as we 're in the reserves . 
  by law you 're eligble until you 're in your 40s . 
  there are bi - / annual exercises for the reservists depending on location . 
  we also build mountain caves for our equipment and ammo dumps . 
  we said the same thing after wwi , when the germans arrived in oslo fjord we were very unprepared and under-equipped . 
  never again , that 's why we maintain our forces . 
   is it just random or can you opt out if you 're a student or just unwilling to serve ? 
  i 'm not an expert , but i believe it 's primarily what the various units need . 
  physical fitness , mental health , ability to work in teams and all that matter . 
  a bad attitude or unwillingness will often get you out . 
  we 're selected right out of high school , so there are fewer university students in the pool . 
  you may apply for a deferement . 
  there are real education opportunities in the armed forces ; including mechanics , pilots , truck driver 's license , welding , war college ( officer ) etc. 
  if you have skills and serve at a later age you may be placed in a fitting position ( it for example ) . 
  if you 're a conscientious objector you may serve in [ the civil defense ] ( http://www.sivilforsvaret.no/s/english/ ) or at nursing homes , kindergartens etc. 
   why is conscription still a thing in norway ? 
  i 'm not quite sure myself , in general i believe many find it 's a good thing ( tm ) for our youth . 
  it does give you something to bond over . 
  my father and brothers served . 
  my father kepts his ag3 rifle at home since he was legally also a reservist until his 40s . 
  regular bi - / annual exercises . 
  we ca n't match russia 's standing army , but we can train [ our home guard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_guard_\\ ( norway \\ ) ) and keep reservists . 
  if we 're invaded we 'll never stop russia , but we can give them some real resistance along the way . 
  hopefully , our nato allies will come to our aid . 
  another friend served in a special home guard unit that was especially well trained and equipped . 
  they would perform special missions in case of an invasion . 
  they were paid extra to serve as reservists , while continuing to work their normal day jobs . 
   conscription for women ? 
  why ? 
  it 's a matter of principle and equality ; all * citizens * should serve their country . 
  quite a few young women want to serve [ after high school ] and have done so voluntarily for many years now . 
  we just changed the laws with regards to duty . 
  the goal is to have 20 % women . 
  we 're also [ introducing unisex dorms for women and men ] ( http://www.thelocal.no/20140324/norway-army-makes-men-and-women-share-rooms ) . 
  we have conscription in norway , but also professional soldiers for our nato rapid reaction forces etc. 
  we also recently introduced conscription for women . 
  in reality only a few of us get selected to serve these days . 
  - 12 months was normal ( average ) , but it could be more if you joined the right/wrong branch . 
  i believe service [ in the navy ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drugoi/484155/9265909/9265909_original.jpg ) could be a little longer . 
  for many it 's just a `` wasted '' year , but it 's not too bad . 
  the pay is very low . 
  people are generally quite nice , [ the equipment varies ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drugoi/484155/9265598/9265598_original.jpg ) , but the living quarters are fine . 
  all in all , i believe it 's a good experience since it does give you friends for life , some travel experience , a new perspective perhaps . 
  if nothing else you quickly learn how to groom yourself . 
  - you 're given some points towards your university entry exams . 
  - you may end up [ guarding the border against russia ( nato exercise ) ] ( http://drugoi.livejournal.com/3977838.html ) , it 's quite desolate and boring up there . 
  service in the navy can take you to ports in the med . 
  if you have what it takes you may even up [ becoming a f16 pilot ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drugoi/484155/9265371/9265371_original.jpg ) , trained at the gov ' t expense in the us . 
  i had a friend who decided to continue after his national service was over , to help train the next batch for his unit in the king 's guard . 
  those guys guard the king 's palaces , do urban warfare training - and * one * unit [ travels around the world performing ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnvy1r2mtsw ) . 
  let me give you an example of the opposite . 
  the russians are well known for their high and frequent consumption of vodka . 
  it 's a feature of their culture ; it 's not limited to friday/saturday nights . 
  it does n't mean they do n't drink a lot of beer as well , but it 's a spirit native to russia and part of many social `` rituals '' . 
  i know the stats show that the average russian male drinks a lot more vodka than any other european ( or american ) . 
  okay , i guess i just have a certain impression of you guys from sailing across the baltic sea , 
   i bet fewer scandinavians die of slipping on ice and breaking their neck than in the uk . 
  we have a distinct gait that we learn as children . 
  [ source ( warning !, 
  pdf ) ] ( http://www.jicosh.gr.jp/en/indu_hel/pdf/ih_46_1_15.pdf ) : - abstract : the objective of this study was to explain the contribution of lower extremity muscle activity to gait kinetic and kinematic adaptations for maintaining gait dynamic balance when walking on an inclined icy surface and the biomechanical mechanisms used to counteract slip risk . 
  i sort of wonder about the veracity of this map ; we 're more beer folk up here . 
  finland , maybe , but the rest of us are primarily beer drinkers , at least if you 're talking about at home/socially . 
  speaking of germanic countries , you might be interested in [ this ted talk about language , culture and economy . 
  ] ( https://www.ted.com/talks/keith_chen_could_your_language_affect_your_ability_to_save_money ), 
  i 'd love to discuss why !, 
  as you 've probably noticed my own country is not a member of the eu . 
  however , that belies the fact that we 're very much part of the inner market . 
  we did so through a free trade agreement between efta and the eu . 
  we contribute [ more than ] our fair share to the eu . 
  now , switzerland decided to skip that bit , while remaining a member of efta . 
  their successive bilateral agreements with the eu have served the same purpose . 
  that is until now , as the eu is apparently dissatifised with the extra work needed . 
  the recent rejection of eu citizens ( immigration policy ) probably wo n't help . 
  i read somewhere that the eu is considering expanding by making new candidate countries and/or partners join the eea first ( or as a replacement for full membership ) . 
  the eu could of course end up cancelling the treaty altogether . 
   somehow middle-sized countries like the uk ca n't . 
  now , why the swiss `` get away '' with it is perhaps less clear . 
  i expect the benefits of swiss trade is bigger than the cost . 
  i do n't see what the us for example would get out of opening up and giving uk extra benefits ? 
  unless it 's a way of buying friends , which is perfectly acceptable . 
  it 's how russia does business and it works ( see germany and the ukraine conflict ) . 
  if the uk was side-lined that would only benefit other financial markets ? 
  what can the uk offer china for example ? 
  yes , education for a few wealthy students , but what else ? 
  it seems to me that the chinese would benefit a whole lot more from a fta than british industry . 
   big countries like the usa can do fine outside the eu i do n't quite agree with that definition , the us is the eu 's equivalent , or perhaps more correctly vice versa . 
  the trade deal between the eu and us is more evidence of this . 
  the eu and us are part of a very large integrated atlantic economy . 
   i see that switzerland manages to get good trade deals with a lot of the world . 
  i think the uk can too . 
  hmm , i do n't know if that really is a rule that applies to larger countries . 
  i understand your desire to seek alternatives to the eu . 
  yes , the eu is very much so , but that 's sort of my point as well . 
  would n't you rather be in a group with some support , than to stand alone in the face of overwhelming opposition ? 
  you would have to kowtow to the chinese again , because you need them more than the reverse . 
  the eu and china might be more of a match ( size-wise ) , one that could work out fairer trade terms . 
  while that may be true , do you have the experience/data to claim that ? 
  on behalf of all those countries ? 
  it 's all well and good to be for free trade , but it does n't help your cause that the majority of the world is rather less enthusiastic about it . 
  just look at china , it 's a wto member , but is it really a free trade country ?
