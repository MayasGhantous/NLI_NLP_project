  to be fair the european parliament is rather toothless by comparison with the council and national parliaments . 
   people are sick of the current system for a reason . 
  people 's trust in smarmy and incompetent politicians is at an all time low for a reason . 
  i 'm not disagreeing , but what 's the alternative ? 
  politicians will always be humans ( varying degrees of competence and often flawed ) . 
  i like the idea of a meritocracy , plato had some interesting ideas in `` the republic '' . 
  why let the uninformed vote on macro-economic plans ? 
  you ca n't sugar coat reality enough , to make voters accept cuts . 
  if only their real estate and justice system worked properly , 
  hehe , yeah , that was really simple . 
  i knew that scotland had a separate legal system and tradition , but that was a bit more than expected . 
  the english/welsh system seems more like what i 'm familiar with . 
    economically liberal , morally conservative . 
   like us republicans ? 
  i do n't know about their `` morals '' , but they are [ socially conservative . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_conservatism ), 
  oh , i see , that 's not actually surprising . 
  the uk stands out in my mind as a place where `` traditional '' methods remain strong . 
  this lack of information/transparency would surprise my compatriots . 
  i do n't know how it works where you live , but here i 'm unsatisifed if i ca n't get my deed registered within the week . 
  at least it 's available electronically , while [ this searchable national website gives you maps , photos and property information ] ( http://www.seeiendom.no ) i remember we actually exported our public land register system ( software/methods ) to the then ex-soviet baltic states . 
  maybe we should pitch in scotland as well ? 
   the trillion dollar gas fund sorry , but it 's called the `` oil fund '' locally , we 're [ mainly known for our oil exports . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3jz1sdt.png ) gas is something of a recent addition by comparison . 
    sometimes called `` social security fund '' , at least in certain articles . 
  perhaps in greece ? 
  in international media it 's commonly referred to as our sovereign wealth fund ( swf ) or the norwegian `` pension fund '' . 
  in some sense it 's a `` security '' fund , but it 's meant to secure future generations . 
  we do harvest an annual 4 % of the surplus for our national budget . 
  the national budget is still 75 % financed by ordinary taxes . 
  the reason it bugs me to read `` social security fund '' is because that 's the name of the american system . 
  anyone reading it might believe that we 're funding our system the same way . 
   a migrant worker are we talking about people from the caucasus/the - stans ? 
  or even further away ? 
   norweigan style social security fund i think you might have the names confused ? 
  the trillion dollar swf does not pay any pensions . 
  there is a separate and older fund for actual pensions . 
  social security is a national budget post . 
   the idea of norway being a gas producing country were not only delusional but insane hmm , we found oil in the late 1960s . 
  gas exports increased after the 1990s . 
   provides around 40 + % of their gdp oil & gas represented 25-27 % of our gdp in 2011-2012 . 
   the owners of land should be identified in a public register is it not public information in scotland or is there no central registry ? 
  the ultimate no-brand products !, 
  hungary wins !, 
  i buy the generic versions of products frequently , sometimes it 's more obvious that it was the cheaper alternative . 
  while i do n't fully disagree , let me put it another way ; a loaf of bread varies greatly , the cheapest * kneipp * will not compare favorably with some * spelt * loaf with mixed grains , nuts , poppy seed sprinkles etc. 
  yes , my point exactly , most european countries have progressive tax systems , capital gains taxes , various services etc. 
  yeah , it was just what i found on a quick search . 
  those damn norwegian sources are harder to find when you want them , 
  sounds better to me . 
  in fact it sounds very familiar ; `` godt & gunstig '' in scandinavian . 
  i imagine apples taste almost the same regardless of brand . 
  that is if they 're actually apples , or just sugar with traces of apple . 
  the tax rate in norway is an average of 28-32 % ( on actual taxable income , after you make deductions , such as mortgages . 
  only income over a minimum threshold , subject to family status , number of children , capital gains etc ) . 
  the public services you receive in return are not as easy to quantify ( kindergartens , healthcare , neo-natal service , parental leave , monthly subsidy checks for each child , etc. ) . 
  that would vary a lot from country to country . 
  i understand that the uk is much more expensive with regards to childcare ; mothers stay at home to avoid a loss . 
  i wonder if that 's even remotely possible to accurately portray . 
  the average/media tax rates maybe . 
  would that give us anything meaningful ? 
  sorry for the late reply . 
  yes , there was a map in the news just a few months ago . 
  it was a heatmap and with some detailed predictions . 
  i did n't keep it , but a quick search resulted [ in this map ] ( http://imgur.com/aqkuz8b ) . 
  even the simpler map i found shows clear variations , in some cases rising and others falling . 
  [ source ( warning : pdf ) ] ( http://miljodirektoratet.no/documents/publikasjoner/m34/m34.pdf ), 
  it 's literally not even `` ok '' ?!, 
  it 's like good-ish , 
  here it 's `` firstprice '' , how more literal can they make it ? 
  first price , then quality !, 
  i hear you 're looking at joining the eu ; we 'd gladly have you back ? 
  you could join us in the green zone , 
   is svalbard just being included with norway with ? 
  why the odd phrasing ? 
  it 's not a separate entity , it 's part of norway . 
  svalbard has no native population , most people come and go . 
  though most are norwegians , people from other countries * are free to live there . 
  hehe , yeah , that 's true . 
  most people probably did , it 's not logical to focus on canada only . 
   from the most southern part of norway to the most northern or eastern part your logic seems a bit strange . 
  from south to north it makes sense . 
  however from south -  east , through sweden ? 
  leave it to the germans to create and deliver the technology needed to go beyond that limit , 
  i 'm not sure if you 're familiar with our roads ? 
  it 's not possible to drive across norway and maintain 100 km/h on average . 
  we just have too many mountains , fjords , lakes , rivers and valleys . 
  it does n't apply to the whole country . 
  hehe , but we only have 3 % arable land ... 
  look for the wall we 'll be building between norway and sweden  you guys will probably take all the climate refugees , we 'll lock the door . 
  [ the northern sea route ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_sea_route ) ( europe-china ) [ has just `` opened '' ] ( http://barentsobserver.com/en/arctic/2013/08/first-container-ship-northern-sea-route-21-08 ) and is bound to change things !, 
  colonialism ? 
  slave trade ? 
  yes , even denmark ( see us virgin islands , danish india , slave forts in africa , etc ) . 
  yes . 
  please , note that the temperature is much milder in scandinavia than in greenland , canada or siberia due to [ the rocky mountains and the gulf stream .
