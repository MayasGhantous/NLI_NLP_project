  for example all the songs on the lastest katy perry album is produced by swedes . 
  in that case i 'll mention [ norway 's `` stargate '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stargate_\\ ( production_team \\ ) ) : - 1999 : `` s club party '' ( s club 7 ) - 1999 : `` always come back to your love '' ( samantha mumba ) - 1999 : `` two in a million '' ( s club 7 ) - 2000 : `` day & night '' ( billie piper ) - 2000 : `` mama - who da man ?

  interestingly , [ yesterday and today we agree ( d ) on two things . 
  no dispute from me either ; just pointing out facts for the other readers , 
  naturally most people live in the big cities everywhere . 
  the number of people who drive long distances in norway/sweden are greater than in denmark . 
  we maintain a strong rural policy , so people continue to live all over the country here . 
  another difference and factor is terrain ; denmark is almost flat , here we have mountains . 
  it takes 7-9 hrs to drive from my home city to oslo by car , but just 45 mins by air . 
   norway , sweden , and denmark do n't differ much by urbanisation rate the numbers do n't quite agree , there is some difference : - denmark 86.9 % - sweden 85 % - norway 79 % those percentage points between ~ 87 % and 79 % matter . 
   if you live in a city , you can ride a bike ; no matter how much hinterland there is that 's probably true for many cities , it 's a bit more difficult during winter here . 
  copenhagen is not like troms\u00f8 or ume\u00e5 . 
   i guess it 's because of bicycles . 
  sure , you do n't need cars as much , but you 're comparing apples and oranges . 
  your * whole * country could fit inside one of our largest counties ( finnmark  denmark ) . 
  sweden is even larger than norway again . 
   he certainly wrote it in swedish is n't it 's more likely to be in old norse ? 
  the language that was spoken by inhabitants of scandinavia during the viking age . 
  it was mentioned in the video that he had it translated ( futhark ) . 
  most runestones were created around 950-1100 , and at the time old norse was the dominant [ language ( s ) in our region ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/old_norse%2c_ca_900.png/1024px-old_norse%2c_ca_900.png ) ( red and orange ), 
  [ map of sunshine hours in europe ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/europe_sunshine_hours_map.png ), 
  i 'm afraid wikipedia does n't cover the topic very well . 
  i would even claim it 's misleading to some degree . 
   h\u00f8yre seems to lean left with feminism and egalitarianism hehe , there is very little `` feminism '' as such , it 's just utilizing our resources optimally ( men and women ) . 
  we 've made investements in their education , society should maximize the return ( roi ) . 
  it 's a global trend ; women have overtaken men in many countries in higher education ( in % numbers ) . 
  another example includes providing cheap kindergartens for all children in the country . 
  it makes it easier for married and single citizens to work full time , while our gdp and productivity increases . 
  it 's not feminism , it 's economics . 
   the fremskrittspartiet is anti-immigration that 's just not correct , unfair and very misleading . 
  they 're far from pro-immigration , but there is * no * immigration policy in norway . 
  outside of marriage and asylum there is no access [ from outside the eu/eea ] . 
  the party is ** not ** hostile to immigrants , but it does make demands that new residents and refugees * integrate * fully ( learning the language , our culture and laws ) . 
  in the past they had a * fringe * of members with less than `` open '' minds , they were kicked out of the party decades ago . 
  do n't make the mistake of comparing frp with jobbik ( hungary ) . 
  yes , it 's a strange party , but it 's clearly a populist/protest party . 
  a result of our abundant wealth and lack of problems ? 
   the party also has some connections with the american tea party movement those connections are about as solid as salt in water . 
  norway is so far left of the us in general that we might as well be `` communists '' . 
  h\u00f8yre is a member of the [ international democrat union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_democrat_union ) along with the us republican party . 
  we have little in common in practise . 
   identical to all other '' conservative '' parties in europe ? 
  i 'm sorry , but you really do n't know norway at all . 
  as a member of said party in norway , i 'd love to hear how we resemble `` neo-con '' parties in europe . 
  politics in social-democratic scandinavia do n't even remotely resemble your country 's . 
  here 's an example of how progressive my party actually is : [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioe3dewje0q#t=88 ) or [ text ] ( http://stopspending.org/ansgar-gabrielsen-the-father-of-the-women39s-quota-comes-from-norway/ ), 
  your lack of knowledge of norway in particular is highly amusing !, 
  `` oligarchs '' in norway , hahaha !, 
  read a book . 
  the grants in question are handed out * only * because the eu ** requires ** us to pay for market access !, 
  you sound like a complete fool claiming norway 's buying influence in hungary . 
  listen , it * fails * to qualify as imperialism because it in no way extends norway 's power and influence in hungary . 
  - hungarian organizations working for hungary 's society is not giving norway anything at all !, 
  it 's building hungary for hungarians . 
  there is no political bias or political parties involved in the eea grants . 
  there is no `` left wing '' focus as you claim . 
  when will you * get * that central fact ? 
  norway is currently ruled by conservative right-wing coalition government . 
   correct me if i 'm wrong but is n't that a form of imperialism ? 
  okay , i 'll correct you . 
  - imperialism : '' * a policy of extending a country 's power and influence through colonization , use of military force , or other means * . '', 
  which of these do you believe norway 's funding of hungarian civil society falls under ? 
  we 're not `` importing '' anything , or exporting , these are ** hungarian ** people 's organizations in hungary . 
  they exist , so we give them money . 
  it 's on the government 's public website in norwegian and english . 
  it 's old news to me ... 
  what 's `` cash '' ? 
  i found some round , flat pieces of metal once . 
  they did n't fit in my card wallet . 
  no , as it 's not a trade barrier for non-danish companies ? 
  the eu citizen visiting denmark does n't have any rights to pay in his currency or cards . 
  oh , it 's a descendant . 
  thanks !, 
  month and week seems like latin , what does zile come from ? 
  it 's heartbreaking to read !, 
  good point . 
  have you been to scandinavia ? 
  we 're the very definition of silent in public . 
  or maybe something about population density as well ? 
  i moved to a village . 
  now , i ca n't see anything outside at night , except for the moon and stars . 
  it 's all pitch black and shades of darkness . 
  even my lamps do n't reach very far . 
  it 's a bit unnerving at first . 
  the only respite is when the fjord below is lit up by the fullmoon . 
  you must read more romanian history now !, 
  hungary is also very relevant . 
  it 's such a * simple * insult , it 's almost insulting . 
  i honestly do n't know , [ the new border is basically a 50/50 down-the-middle split ] ( http://en.ria.ru/images/16061/27/160612757.jpg ) . 
  it does n't quite fit with the map , but i thought sochi fit `` putinburg '' better . 
   georgia is also pretty popular from what i 've heard . 
  [ that war back in 2008 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_georgia%e2%80%93russia_crisis ) made things worse . 
  the russians [ banned imports of wine from georgia ] ( http://en.ria.ru/business/20131216/185616873/georgia-doubles-wine-exports-as-russian-market-reopens.html ) , just to hit them where it hurts . 
  now , they 're opening up again . 
  sochi was a beach resort even during soviet times . 
  that 's not in crimea , it 's probably [ novorossiysk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hnifwip.png ) , krasnodar krai , russia . 
  sochi is a little further east .
