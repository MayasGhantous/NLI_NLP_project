  it 's pretty ironic considering the russians demanded svalbard and bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya during the cold war , recently planted their flag under the ice at the north pole - and only now agreed to finalize the maritime borders with norway . 
  that 's an interesting fact , but like you said it did n't happen . 
   how different norwegians and danes are for immigration compared to swedes . 
  yes , it 's a bit strange , since we were quite similar . 
  the swedish social-democrat 's policies were once copied by the other nordic countries . 
  i 'm not sure exactly what changed , or if it was always a little different . 
  the swedes have a higher degree of urbanization and clear differences in regional politics , language matters etc. 
  perhaps it 's related to their empire , maybe some sort of guilt . 
   i read an article in a major swedish newspaper criticizing norway for having ethnic norwegian on the census in that sense sweden seems extremly `` left wing '' to me . 
  we 're quite proud to belong to our own ethnic group and nation . 
   i 'm not sure we 'd fit in all that well . 
  oh , i think you would , one of my colleagues has a similar [ german ] background to you . 
   i love how norwegians claim their country sucks it 's better to be honest about such things ; the cost of living is high , salaries high , but not everything is done equally well , at least when compared with larger countries . 
  our highways are subpar , our schools are too unfocused etc. 
   the swedes i have met all worked in norway yes , there are tons of young swedes in oslo 's bars , coffee shops and restaurants . 
  some of them even live in insular communities consisting exclusively of other swedes . 
  they stay a few years and leave , richer in terms of currency ... 
  i doubt they could pass a citizenship test on norwegian history or culture . 
  furthermore , oslo is not representative of norway in general , berlin is quite different from bayern . 
   they probably say that cuz they 're so awkward and politically correct oh , yes , swedes and norwegian are quite similar , but politically there are some differences . 
   i really need to move to scandinavia if the us does n't work out for me . 
  i work with americans , germans and scandinavians on both continents . 
  it 's easy for germans to fit in here with us scandinavians . 
  the americans experience some culture shock . 
  i wo n't claim it 's `` paradise '' . 
  norway has it 's real faults and is lacking in some areas . 
   they claimed norwegians are a lot like americans compared to the rest of northern europe . 
  never believe a swede  norway 's a very long country , regional culture varies greatly . 
  norway is almost as large as germany , with a small population spread all over . 
  most young swedes have very little actual knowledge of norway in general . 
  we 're known for our oil , but that 's it . 
   do you guys just do that in the us to fit in or did i completely misunderstand you guys ? 
  hmm , i would say we 're fairly outgoing , especially during the college years . 
  at the end of our * abitur * we have the [ traditional `` russ '' celebrations ] ( http://www.thisblogrules.com/2009/10/norwegian-graduation-students-use.html ) . 
  here 's another [ little story on `` russ '' . 
  ] ( http://journalism.curtin.edu.au/travel/2011/a-crazy-norwegian-tradition ), 
   harmful generalisation i doubt you can really substantiate that claim . 
  hmm , that 's true , turkey is a nato member and an ally . 
  mostly allows the us to fly over when it wants . 
  finland however was not and had to maintain a close relationship with russia . 
  at one point finland was part of russia , they did n't want that to happen again . 
  i 'd like to point out that the `` battlefield '' ( game ) is from sweden ... makes sense ? 
  heck , we 're buying the world ; 1,25 % of the world 's shares at the moment . 
  voting is part of the democratic process , but it does n't automatically give you the results you want . 
  there must be filters out there that let you filter using keywords ( '' * think of my * '' ) . 
  i would say there are two reasons ; firstly , because of the high quality universities , secondly because we easily understand the language . 
  it does n't hurt that the degrees are acknowledged and accepted around the world , or that you can build a larger more international network there . 
  jobs and opportunities are more easily found in your personal network than elsewhere . 
  the stereotype of the `` cold '' and shy scandinavian is misunderstood . 
  foreigners think we 're `` shy '' because we follow our social rules , we simply wish to avoid disturbing you or to invade your personal space . 
  the moment you 're known to us , you 're a friend for life - and we 'll open up like spring after a long winter . 
  sure , i 'm just describing when and what , 
  you could just vote on the posts you like ? 
  there are ways of filtering reddit as well . 
  okay , i just wondered because we received quite a few ex-yugoslav refugees after the war . 
  bosnians , serbs , kosovo-albanians etc. 
  sure , but you 're free to skip reading those ? 
  it will die out soon enough , or rather repeat itself every other year . 
  i think the saddest part was that they were refugees that did n't approve of their * economic * situation . 
  i guess once you have safety and peace , you start thinking about comfort . 
  syrian refugees are now arriving in bulgaria by way of turkey . 
  in the interviews i read they were upset because it was so poor and they thought they were in europe now . 
  some refused to register or get health care because they were afraid of getting stuck in bulgaria . 
  why not ? 
  it 's fun to read , and you learn something new . 
  we all have stereotypes and strange impressions , both as individuals and cultures . 
   it 's just another small former soviet country in the balkans bulgaria was never an actual * soviet * republic ? 
  it was a communist country and a [ warsaw pact member ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact ) ( the communist equivalent of nato , [ see map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/military_power_of_nato_and_the_warsaw_pact_states_in_1973.svg/1000px-military_power_of_nato_and_the_warsaw_pact_states_in_1973.svg.png ) ) . 
  were they refugees after the war ? 
  citizens from the eu countries i can understand due to the efta/eu eea-agreement . 
  if they 're immigrants to the us , they 're already per definition not your average bulgarian . 
  we did have one , before the plague it was native , then following the kalmar union , it became either danish-born or educated in copenhagen . 
  the land-holding nobility grew wealthy . 
  there was lots of industry as well ; from mining to artisans . 
  northern european union , next ? 
   overly conservative that 's a new one . 
  why do you think that ? 
  great country , in many ways , rather similar people and very compatible . 
  i 'd much rather like to hear your views on our contributions , they 're clearly there for all to see , but you seem intent on creating ill will . 
  judging from your profile , you 're most likely just a troll ... 
  we all belong to europe , but we belong to scandinavia first . 
   poland is safer than norway you actually have a higher murder rate . 
  did you see all the stats ? 
  hehe , well done , 
   sweden - scandinavian imperialists , fjords , ikea fjords in sweden ? 
  where ? 
  norway is fjord-country . 
   still have no clue how did you manage to grab greenland . 
  it was our colony , they kept it when we left the union . 
  the same goes for iceland and the faroes . 
   hilarious prisons and justice system 15 % recidivism speaks for itself . 
  what 's polands stats ? 
   i do n't find their culture interesting , their contributions to the arts , and science are hardly worth mentioning i question your knowledge of literature , drama , painting , music , modern music , tv and cinema . 
   food was a bit lacking that 's interesting , did you miss your fried mars bars ? 
  we have more in common than not , i suppose . 
  that does n't surprise me , france is n't where we typicall go . 
  it 's all about the uk , us or australia now . 
  satw fan ? 
   danes and norwegians seem a bit smug , really ? 
  do we even have any contact with your countrymen ?
