  this happened in many western countries ... - 2006-2010 : [ forced sterilization in u.s. prisons ] ( http://www.policymic.com/articles/53723/8-shocking-facts-about-sterilization-in-u-s-history ) - virginia did not repeal its sterilization law [ until 1974 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eugenics_in_the_united_states ), 
  to think we suggested splitting it with you for volvo shares ? 
  nordic ! = scandinavia nordic  scandinavia, 
  that does sound like a busy gym . 
  to quote the uk gov 's website : ** `` prove your right to live in the uk as an eu citizen '' ** you can apply for a registration certificate if you 're a citizen of a european economic area ( eea ) country and want to prove your right to live in the uk . 
  you do n't need a registration certificate , but it can : make it easier to claim certain benefits and services be used to support a family member 's application for an eea family permit or residence card you ** must ** be working , studying or able to support yourself independently to apply . 
  i 've worked for credit rating agencies in my country . 
  we do n't evaluate your spending , as that makes no sense at all . 
  due to our national id , databases and cooperation we can track your age/location , former address ( es ) , irs statements for several years , actual bank assets , loans and mortgages , property titles ( real estate and cars ) , insurance policies , failure to pay bills , loan defaults , court mandated debt payments etc. 
  it 's accurate and quite fair , even if it means you do n't get to borrow more than you can carry . 
  every few years it 's reset , but if you continue to pile on notices your rating falls again . 
  it 's a different world to the us , but then again my country 's administration publishes * every * citizen 's income annually on the web . 
  i assume it 's like most gyms ; people pay , but rarely use them . 
  heck , he 's not even legally allowed to stay in other eu member states without a job ( after the initial job searching phase ) . 
  first job requirement : speak the local language ( s ) . 
  czech/english is rarely enough . 
  you could always vote lib-dem and get a surprise result !, 
  at least that way you 're less responsible for the final outcome . 
  sorry , i do n't think you got my sarcasm . 
  in clear text i would have said : `` i think turkey 's ethnic and religious background is the real problem '' . 
   i think the nordic union is a bit far away , but one has a right to dream . 
   what was the book you talked about ? 
  it 's called `` super sad true love story '' by gary shteyngart . 
  i 'm afraid you really are reading this all wrong . 
  i 'm certainly not arguing against a union with germany . 
  that 's why i mentioned the `` option '' of a northern european union . 
  i hope that was clear ? 
  still , there might be a point to associating with only smaller nations like our own . 
  in that case scotland would fit the bill better . 
  to be frank i 'd rather just have a nordic union that includes dk , no , se , is , fi and various island groups . 
  i 'm not sure if norway would want to join a union with germany or other non-nordic european countries . 
  we 've rejected the eu twice now , but i do n't know about another union with denmark or sweden either . 
  this year we celebrate the bi-centennial anniversary of our constitution and regained sovereignty . 
  it 's only been a hundred years since our last relationship , and the one before lasted 400 years . 
  at least the last break-up was n't too messy and we remained friends , 
  my dear swedish friend , i see no point to arguing with you over this theoretical and rather unlikely event . 
  it all depends on what form of nordic cooperation we would have . 
  your suggestion that `` we '' join the germans and dutch is n't that far fetched , or at least for you eu members . 
  in an amusing little book i recently read the setting was a world where you had two major economic powers ; china and the northern european union . 
  that 's exactly what i meant , thanks . 
  while i disagree , i think it 's rather fitting that you made that comment . 
  it 's all about culture and ethnicity , and not about money . 
  the estonians are doing quite well actually . 
  they 'll be on our level soon enough . 
  on the other hand they 're far from my kin . 
  heck , i do n't consider the finns `` scandinavian '' and according to my domestic dictionary 's definition they 're not . 
  they 're a nordic people . 
  in some ways i believe it 's the same problem for turkey with regards to the european union . 
  i do n't think the real problem is your geographic location . 
   culturally it does n't really matter . 
  it 's about cooperation , not laying down the foundations of a new nation or anything like that . 
  yes , i agree . 
  it 's more about ideas , not blood-ties . 
  it just does n't hurt that there is shared history between our countries . 
   estonia , latvia and lithuania join as well . 
  they 're already involved . 
  nordic-baltic cooperation , known as [ nb8 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nb8 ) , is informal regional cooperation involving denmark , finland , iceland , norway , sweden , estonia , latvia and lithuania . 
   are you claiming that scottish culture is more nordic than english . 
  you are the person claiming that '' * almost all their cultural heritage is connected to england * '' . 
   cool , let 's start with dismissing their legal system you mean the mixed civil law and common law system ? 
  what about it ? 
   that they have a slightly different culture than other states does n't make minnesota nordic , and it is idiotic to state that . 
  your arguments seem very informed , cultured and potent . 
  i ca n't argue with `` idiotic '' . 
  - have you seen the [ up helly aa festival ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/up_helly_aa ) ? 
  - [ norwegian constitution day ( 17th of may ) celebrations ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip5k-qnbcli ) in kirkwall , orkney , scotland . 
  - [ st magnus cathedral in kirkwall ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._magnus_cathedral ), 
   all their cultural heritage is connected to england that 's clearly not true for a number of reasons including some of which i mentioned above . 
  do you know much scottish history ? 
  auld alliance , for example ? 
   with that line of thinking minnesota should be nordic , but they are americans . 
  you obviously have n't been to minnesota or had any relatives over ... 
  have you heard the concept of minnesota-nice and `` squareheads '' ? 
  it 's a different culture [ in the us ] and it persists . 
  i 've been to glasgow , maybe it 's not copenhagen , but it 's quite nice . 
  maybe they 'd rather join our `` big society '' than cameron 's ? 
  they do have a strong connection with some of us . 
  parts of scotland and ireland were norwegian ; including shetlands , orkneys , isle of man , the city of dublin etc. 
  the danes certainly [ left a mark in the uk ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/england_878.svg/482px-england_878.svg.png ) . 
  - here 's an indication in terms of [ norse language distribution around the year 900 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/old_norse%2c_ca_900.png ) - we settled in their lands and mixed , [ it shows up in dna mapping ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1689955.stm ) . 
  okay , i 'll admit they were n't the best example . 
  i do n't remember what games she spoke about 10 years ago ... 
  these were the only ones mentioned in the newspapers online . 
  obviously , playing by herself or with her children , she 's not likely to play that kind of games . 
  thank you , that comment made my evening !, 
  i do n't think we want to dig too deep , 
  can you imagine living with trolls under every bridge ? 
   a century or two ago , around the 1800s , we had a lot of ** social problems ** due to widespread alcohol abuse . 
  especially amongst working class families this was a problem . 
  due to an increase in production due to better technology it became more widespread . 
  - in 1919 we had a national referendum on ** prohibition ** , i.e. 
  the prevention by law of the manufacture and sale of alcohol . 
  the goal was no alcohol consumed at all . 
  in [ the official history of our monopoly ] ( http://www.vinmonopolet.no/artikkel/om-vinmonopolet/dette-er-vinmonopolet/historie ) , our trade partners are held accountable for the introduction of the distribution/retail monopoly ( 1922 ) . 
  ** france ** especially fought for the ability to sell their wine . 
  if we wanted to continue exporting our products to their market ... 
  this was just after world war i , the economic malaise of the time was felt everywhere . 
  it 's also worth noting that norway is a lutheran ( protestant ) kingdom ; religion played a role in society then . 
  industralization was almost a century old in norway . 
  parliamentarism was introduced in 1884 .
