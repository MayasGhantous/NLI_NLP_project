  the us and europe have a unique relationship and shared history . 
  without the us we would n't be where we are and vice versa . 
  the relationship is a fruitful partnership even today . 
  i do n't believe gaining citizenship of another country `` removes '' your background . 
  i 'm saying south africa deserves credit for giving birth to this man . 
  that 's honoring one country , without taking away from the fact that the us * enabled * him to acheive greatness . 
  - a great athlete is nothing without a stadium to perform in [ and support staff ] . 
  in my mind the us has plenty of great homegrown inventors , innovators and scientists . 
  others are immigrants that get lauded for being great americans with little regard for the fact that they only became americans after having been fully formed ... einstein was about as american as pizza . 
   tries to veil their `` yurop stronk '' beliefs so sorry i do n't agree with you ... ** south africa ** is hardly europe is it ? 
   a country that he merely was born in , but willfully chose to leave . 
  now , who 's taking credit away from whom ? 
  well , it 's as i said , just my view - and probably a lot of countries [ with native populations ] . 
  yes , you have to belong to the culture and be raised in it ? 
  we 're products of our environments , race for example has nothing to do with it . 
  well , that 's the way i see my culture anyway . 
  you americans talk a lot about being blind to your citizens ' origins , but i see it as folly to ignore/obscure it . 
  yes , i know , i just answered your question with a reference to that fact . 
  despite it all he was a south african . 
  his move to the canada/us does n't make him very american in my eyes ... moving to my country does n't make you norwegian , it makes you a citizen . 
  things are different in other countries of course . 
  you mean besides already having canadian citizenship before he ever applied to become a us american ? 
  and then you 'll get them all back !, 
  oh , do n't worry , that eu thing is going to blow over ... 
  ireland is europe 's biggest `` exporter '' of bananas ( fyffes ) . 
  my understanding is that the spoken language is slightly different in brazil though ? 
  naturally , since it 's so far away . 
  i also remember portugal and brazil signing an agreement to standardize using one written norm recently ? 
  i do n't know about the lusophone countries in africa though ? 
  they make me sad because there are so many during rush hour in oslo !, 
  the lane is filled with them and leafs . 
  europeans simply * do n't * have access to venture capital to the same degree . 
  you 're comparing two very different environments . 
  the people who want to build something have to leave for the us . 
  it took a ** south african ** to start tesla ... ( using a european inventor 's name ) . 
  yeah , i 'm only joking though . 
  we 've have got to rub our neighbors noses in it , it would n't be a friendly sibling rivalry without it , 
  hehe , we 'll have to join the russians so we can truly become the `` last soviet state '' ( rosengren ) , 
  i predict the following ( winter games ) : - 1 . 
  norway - 3 . 
  european union ( that 's you sweden , finland ... ), 
  okay , but then we should give points according to where those athletes ended up ( not just the medal winners ) . 
  damn , that 's actually surprising . 
  you have some really good athletes ( winter and summer games ) . 
  oh , it 's like that . 
  yeah , we 've done the same , over the last decade , for exactly the same reasons . 
  finland 's beating both our butts ... 
  i see . 
  we all have our problems , at least yours was fraud based , 
   years ago prague attempted to replace paper tickets with electronic cards . 
  the project was a costly and unusable failure but prague town hall refuses to cancel it . 
  instead , it will sink another 100 million czk ( ~ 3,5 million euro ) into the project we 've spent many times that trying to get a new ( er ) electronic system here in oslo . 
  the old plastic cards worked just fine , but they wanted to improve it . 
  in the end it cost something like 600 million nok = ~ $ 72 millon euro . 
   the government will tighten the rules for admission to university ( it will only affect those with the worst grades ) . 
  quality over quantity ? 
  or is it just a matter of finances ? 
  no , we clearly disagree , i 'm saying it 's a symbol for europe in general . 
  they are europeans , they want their freedom and are asking their leaders to align more closely with europe - over russia 's eurasian union . 
  i do n't think the people on the ground in ukraine or the author really care to distinguish between europe or the eu . 
  it 's not about the organization itself , while it 's clearly important , it 's about belonging to europe as a free nation . 
  the ideals are what matter . 
  what do you think the norwegian and danish ships were carrying before they picked up the chemical weapons from syria ? 
   http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-26124161, 
  you 're welcome , przyjaciel , 
  to be fair , it 's not that bad in the city any longer . 
  you can go on guided tours , but you do n't want to stay too long near the reactor site . 
  the area around the reactor will be habitable in around 500 - 600 years . 
  i agree . 
  technology , knowledge and communication helps a lot . 
  just [ look at the spanish flu ( 1918 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic ) . 
  it was equally potent , but that only killed people - it did n't ruin civilizations . 
  or more recently h1n1 bird flu . 
  the next disaster will be better handled , 
  no , you poles do n't seem to understand building in wood . 
  i 've met a few polish construction workers here in norway , they 're always surprised by the difference . 
  your wood is nothing like ours ; yours grows too fast and is bad for buildings . 
  it 's only good for firewood . 
  here in scandinavia we have wooden buildings that are many centuries old . 
  it 's not a problem if you do a little maintenance . 
  the buildings are much better to live in with our climate , a lot better than concrete ... now , from what my friends in the american building materials industry tells me , the mcmansions are built using cheap materials that do n't last very long . 
  the [ recent scandal involving imported chinese dry-wall ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_drywall ) just underlines the problem . 
  it 's the stuff hanging on the wooden framework that does n't last ... 
  was n't dublin a [ norwegian ] viking settlement ? 
  even the official guides at the castle in dublin said so when i was there . 
  i also remember him saying the name was based on `` black pool '' . 
  ford ; a shallow part of a river , stream , etc. , that may be crossed by walking or driving across . 
  ox-ford ; where you drive the oxen across the river between pastures ? 
  [ svalbard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svalbard ) is ** not ** a nation or independent , it is part of the kingdom of norway . 
  the archipelago does n't have a native population , they 're all from the mainland or foreign nationals . 
  people [ are n't even * buried * on svalbard ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7501691.stm ) . 
  since you like our arctic islands , [ bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya ( bear island ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bear_island_\\ ( norway \\ ) ) and [ jan mayen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_mayen ) are uninhabited but manned by the military , weather service and researchers . 
  while [ bouvet island ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bouvet_island ) , near antarctica , is completely empty . 
   i strongly disagree with your assertion that immigrant born people will never hold high office in european countries high office ? 
  that 's not * exactly * what i said , is it ? 
  obviously there are any number of those , from france to italy ( arab justice and african integration minister respectively ) . 
  president/prime minister is another matter , one that requires popular support . 
  it seems to me that you 're extrapolating and applying what 's a reality in britain to all of europe . 
  i 'm sorry , but the reality is that we are not as multi-cultural as you are . 
   second gens generally stand just as much chance of making the cut as a full blooded native , assuming they have the resources and the influence to do so .
