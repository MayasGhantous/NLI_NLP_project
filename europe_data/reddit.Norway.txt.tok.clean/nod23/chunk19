  oh , absolutely , that 's usually the case no matter which culture you come from or go to . 
  high office is absolutely achievable ; on merits or as appointments . 
  still , norway is not similar to the uk , and the same goes for a lot of countries around europe . 
  i doubt we will ever have a pakistani-norwegian pm , or a turkish-ethnic chancellor of germany . 
  it 's not that i oppose the idea , i only care about the politician 's education and skills , i just realize that people are far from color blind or neutral on that issue . 
  i 'll admit i do n't track their operations , but this is what i remember reading : - how zara grew into the world 's largest fashion retailer [ ( new york times , 2012 ) ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/magazine/how-zara-grew-into-the-worlds-largest-fashion-retailer.html ) : '' * more than half of inditex 's manufacturing takes place either in the factories it owns or within proximity to company headquarters , which is to say in europe or northern africa . 
  inditex owns factories in spain and outsources production to factories in portugal , morocco and turkey -- considered costly labor markets , typically . 
  the rest of its clothes are produced in china , bangladesh , vietnam and brazil , among other countries * '' . 
  - inditex produces half of its merchandise in factories in ** spain , portugal ** , and morocco , keeping the manufacturing of the most fashionable items in-house while buying basics such as t-shirts from shops in eastern europe , africa , and asia . 
  [ ( businessweek , 2008 ) ] ( http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-10-08/zara-thrives-by-breaking-all-the-rules ), 
  sorry , just a random fragment from my memory , i did n't spell check it . 
  funny thing is that i spelled it correctly but changed it to indesit . 
  it 's a bit old fashioned or clinical i suppose . 
  my norwegian dictionary says : * medikament * ( fra latin , av medicare ` helbrede ' ) : legemiddel , medisin . 
  it shows up in [ a danish dictionary here . 
  really ? 
  you do n't have * medikamenter * in danish ? 
  obviously , we import goods from asia , however what 's categorized as european is actually made here . 
  the eu makes it hard to avoid labeling goods correctly . 
  the reaction is hard and swift if discovered . 
  the eu is all about competition law , especially trade within europe . 
  if you import from china and label it made in $ europeancountry you 're liable to get in trouble from competitors . 
  - the portuguese still have a lot of textile industry ( all kinds ) - the spanish runs the world 's largest textiles company ( indesit , i.e. 
  the zara chain ) , they actually produce all over europe . 
  - the italians still have large factories that make designer clothes - the french fashion industry is not a joke, 
  oh , just `` where they get a lot of their money from '' . 
  you see most people think oil funds our state , also the chart gives an impression that oil & gas is all we do . 
  why do i imagine it has to do with lithuanian russians ? 
  oil & gas represented ** 25 % ** of norway 's gdp in 2012 . 
  the exchange rate is hardly the key measurement for our government ; . 
  the pronounced goal of our national bank is to keep inflation down . 
  anyone with a minimum of education in economics recognizes that it 's key to a stable economy . 
  especially for a country with such a high dependency on oil & gas exports and a limited labor pool . 
  the relationship between inflation , wages , unemployment , real estate prices , mortgages , exports and currency exchange rates is complicated and interconnected . 
  there 's no escaping consequences whatever `` we '' do . 
  we should all recognize that italy and france are respectable economies with lots of industry and manufacturing . 
  it 's quickly obvious if you work in any industry where the machinery comes from . 
  it 's not beaches and wine that gave france and italy their wealth , 
  the norwegian national budget is 75 % financed by ordinary taxes ( salaries , corporate and vat ) . 
  the oil & gas revenue is invested abroad in our swf ; we use the annual surplus to fund our budget . 
  oil & gas represented ** 25 % ** of our norway 's gdp in 2012 . 
  edit : it 's strange how many people will vote , but not comment . 
  bring something to the table will you ? 
  trade is trade . 
  the city of london plays with `` money '' that never touches any hands . 
  [ germany is close to exporting more alone than the us ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20130816/51437 ) ( as of 2013 ) . 
  they 're the greatest exporters in all of europe ; with a great deal of deliveries to china in fact . 
  absolutely not , what nonsense !, 
  it was n't even an issue during the elections . 
  the conservative party won fair and square . 
  they formed a government with their junior partner ; the progress party . 
  you must be confused by the bad reporting about our progressive party , a libertarian-conservative party , which was founded in 1978 as the ** anti-tax ** party ( small gov ` t , lower taxes , individual freedoms , free trade ) . 
  for some stupid reason it was called `` anti-immigrant '' in european news media . 
  especially the rather nasty and ignorant swedish press . 
  nevermind the many immigrants that are members , voters and even leaders in the party ( an indian ethnic man leads the youth party , now part of the administration ) . 
  truth be told , they did once have some less than desirable members . 
  people who were not `` politically correct '' and rather anti-immigration . 
  those were removed from the party decades ago ( ? ) . 
  they even attempted to `` tie '' the lunatic anders breivik to the party because he was once a member , but he left since it was n't to his taste ... 
  it was n't anti-immigrant enough . 
  not a single norwegian political party held the progress party responsible for breivik ( ! ), 
  it 's almost as if we 're all interconnected [ economies ] , hehe , 
  i wonder if i can open a radio station in ecuador advocating the genocide of all quichua ? 
  would i remain free for long ? 
   do n't mix up romani with romanians . 
  i know it sounds similar interestingly , the name comes from the vernacular for citizen of the roman empire ; `` romanus '' . 
  romania simply retained the old name after the empire died . 
  i 've always thought it odd that a people that emigrated from india , i.e. 
  the gypsies , would end up with the name `` romani '' . 
  homeless are n't really hated , are they ? 
  the romani on the other hand . 
  i thought it a bit odd to read about problems with somalis in the twin cities . 
  my relatives over there even mentioned it last time they visited as the taxi driver they got in oslo was somali . 
  it 's still just * projected * growth , it 's far from sure . 
  brazil has experienced some setbacks lately , romania might very well grow more than 2 % . 
  yes , of course , there is always `` the game '' before reforms are put in place . 
  give and take between different players . 
  that 's a matter of content . 
  the timeline for implementation is probably going to be within a year ( september 2014 ) . 
   these rapid reforms destabilize institutions and weaken them i really do n't think i can agree with you ; it seems you 're saying there is an absolute rule to how fast reforms may be done . 
  creating legislation that regulates the banking system to reduce risk seems rather logical and needs to be put in place rapidly , not slowly over a decade ? 
  the man lost all my respect when i read :  you see , here in europe , a radio station was closed several years ago , and 23 people were detained because they had spread nazi propaganda . 
  but here [ in ecuador ] there is civilization . 
  in ecuador , we have not closed down any radio station . 
   reforms must not only be done for a common goal and interest but incrementally enough to not threaten such a diverse set of economic interests yes , usually , however the problems actually seems to have forced greater change on eu member states that would have been unthinkable before 2008 ;  members will certainly opt to weaken the eu 's power rather than accept fast change . 
  the proposed banking union is the perfect example of rapid and dramatic changes ... 
   and brazil is going to surpass us in a year or two . 
  yeah , that projection is not so reliable at the moment . 
  you do know brazil is waning ? 
  here , [ let me show you ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-28/brazil-economists-forecast-steeper-economic-slowdown-next-year.html ) : `` brazil economists cut their 2014 economic growth forecast to the lowest all year , as inflation pressured by a weaker real saps purchasing power '' . 
  liberal * immigration * laws ? 
  no , this is specifically asylum for * refugees * . 
  we do n't accept foreigners looking for work from outside of europe any more than you do . 
  norway is not similar to sweden in this regard . 
  sweden is much , much more liberal and accepts far more refugees . 
  they received a lot more iraqis and now syrians . 
  norway does n't want to accept more than 500-1000 syrians . 
  that question has different answers from country to country . 
  in norway we have been homogenous for long time , so even spaniards will never be `` norwegian '' , but you 're welcome to be an equal citizen of norway . 
  - we use two different words for norwegian citizen and ethnic norwegian person .
