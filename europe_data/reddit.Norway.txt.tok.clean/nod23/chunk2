   european ecosystems in general are just not intact . 
  what ? 
  come visit us up north sometime ... 
   europe is 30 + countries 49-50 actually . 
   systembolaget 's status as one of the largest bulk buyers of alcoholic beverages in the world yeah , the same statement applies to norway 's version of `` systembolaget '' . 
  the exporters are always happy to see swedish or norwegian purchasers due to the volumes !, 
   just look at greece . 
  a huge loss . 
  that 's possibly the worst `` example '' of them all , it 's almost atypical . 
  the greek plans for post-games use never worked . 
  [ the london games ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/whats-next-for-the-london-2012-olympic-venues-8037297.html ) did better in that respect . 
  the proposed norway 2022 games were going to reuse the * 1994 * games facilities to some degree . 
  well , the car production itself is hardly pollution free . 
  so there 's that , 
  we have multiple farms running already in norway . 
  this map is for the eu though . 
  we have also built offshore windparks off the coast of the uk ? 
  the norwegian gov ' t owns both [ statkraft ] ( http://www.statkraft.com/energy-sources/wind-power/ ) and statoil . 
  norway is however 99 % hydropowered and has been for a century . 
  we do n't need wind that much . 
   on a similar note , crimea `` voted '' , scotland will vote . 
  democracy or not , van rompuy is a former belgian prime minister , i 'm sure quite a few people around europe knew him , 
  i admit it was mostly a joke . 
  the scottish people are a nation indeed , and as such they are both separatists and nationalists . 
  however , the objective is primarily to separate from the nation state they belong to . 
  that makes them separatists first and foremost in my opinion . 
   the uk is not a `` nation state '' in the conventional sense i 'm quite aware of the details  however , the act ( s ) of union made england and scotland one state legally . 
  the fact that scotland was sovereign does n't make it so now . 
  it 's a separatist movement in that sense . 
  the constituent countries are not actual independent countries , and neither is catalonia . 
   nationalist resurgence ? 
  well , a * separatist * resurgence , opposed to the national state . 
  you know similar to what 's going on between scotland and the uk right now . 
  hehe , that famous british subtlety . 
  this is [ the pro-uk campaign ] ( http://wingsoverscotland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ukok.jpg ) slogan , 
   kreta kallas mini skandinavien p\u00e5 grekiska really ? 
  is that just because of the tourists or people living there ? 
  the us is far too diverse ( regions ) to be compared with germany . 
   human nature isn \u00b4 t that different from continent to continent , even though we like to think so . 
  it 's not human nature that 's the problem , it 's the various cultures we are products of . 
  whatever color you are , you too can be an asshole , hehe . 
  i 'm sure you would not feel so at home in congo , if you 're used to norway  congo could probably be a great place to live , if they had the same resources and an educated population . 
  can i suggest a theory ? 
   is the climate such in portugal [ in general ] that you could survive without much housing and clothing ? 
  i realize it 's not all warm , but by comparison you could n't survive a winter outside here . 
  cheat !, 
   the norwegians used to give money to ngos in hungary , technically , we will still give and will continue to do so  the money will just accumulate until this is resolved . 
  the eu is currently pushing for norway to pay even more for our eu market access :(, 
  please , it 's not as if the us pays for our armed forces or our equipment . 
  here 's [ the nato budget in percentages ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pictures/stock_2014/20140611_140601_nato_common_funded_budgets_2014-2015.jpg ) - it 's quite clear that the us funds more than any other nation ( ** 22 % ** ) - the other nations contribute the majority let me [ quote nato ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_67655.htm ) itself : - `` today , the volume of the us defence expenditure effectively represents 73 per cent of the defence spending of the alliance as a whole . 
  this does ** not ** mean that the united states covers 73 per cent of the costs involved in the operational running of nato as an organisation ... '' - '' ... but it does mean that there is an over-reliance by the alliance as a whole on the united states for the provision of essential capabilities , including for instance , in regard to intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ; air-to-air refuelling ; ballistic missile defence ; and airborne electronic warfare . '', 
  hehe , but you 're buying cv90s , right ? 
   the sum of what you 're saying is nato works well . 
  that 's true but it is nothing like european collaboration because it is overwhelmingly us funded . 
  that last bit needs a source or explanation . 
   it does n't help us believe larger scale cooperation is either possible perhaps we 're not using the word `` possible '' in the same manner . 
  i say it 's a possibility because i believe we can scale up . 
   but fighting as one unit , e.g. 
  two nations in the same army , is wildly different . 
  we seemed to manage that very well during the libya conflict ? 
  france and the uk at the heart , working together just fine [ using nato command lines ] . 
  denmark and norway provided a proportionally large number of the combat flights during that conflict . 
  i did n't hear any complaints about communication or coordination . 
  the isaf regions in afghanistan were organized around the same concept . 
  in our zone you had various other european nation 's soldiers living and working along side our troops . 
  the language barrier was easily overcome . 
  the americans , british , canadians and danes worked well in helmand . 
  [ a dutch brigade has integrated well into the german army ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140613/defreg01/306130024/dutch-brigade-integrates-german-forces ) . 
  the french-german eurocorps is an interesting example , but they have n't fought in any wars yet . 
  now , it might not be exactly the same , but you certainly managed to use canadian , anzac and other troops well enough during wwi for example ? 
  defensive ? 
  oh , no , i 'm afraid you 're reading me all wrong  i 'm just pointing out that the illustration does n't give us all of the numbers we need [ if we wanted the complete picture ] . 
  the problem being that any major economic breakdown has global consequences now ? 
  it was the us banking crisis and housing market crash that lead to the euro crisis after all . 
  the russian import ban is hurting us a little , a russian collapse and massive investment loss would probably hurt worse . 
  first the world 's banks , then the world 's governments and finally the people . 
   it does n't help us believe larger scale cooperation is either possible or realistic . 
  does n't it do exactly that ? 
  it proved that the cooperation worked on a smaller scale , now the real challenge is a major conflict . 
   ( if that pact was specific towards ussr that is ) . 
  i believe it still stands and was more of general defense agreement . 
  if they were attacked nato allies would come to their rescue . 
  the ussr was the only potential state threat then and now [ in the form of russia ] . 
  today sweden and finland regularly take part in nato exercises in the nordic region as `` partners '' . 
  if that was how you measured a fighting force 's ability or quality . 
  their ability to cooperate and coordinate is far more interesting . 
  the point was that european forces are able to join together effectively . 
  you ca n't simply dismiss their success just because the enemy was n't more dangerous . 
  oh , okay , i thought your joke ended in the first paragraph , 
   state-owned industries almost always have more dead weight and inefficient structures . 
  yes , however suppliers to the us army for example are known for their extraordinarily high prices for even the smallest item ( bolts , screws etc ) . 
  note that the mig company is a business , just state-owned . 
  that does n't automatically make it inefficient , but i would agree that it 's likely so . 
   privately-owned oil companies outperform state-owned ones without fail everywhere in the world . 
  hmm , statoil of norway was a pretty good counter-example but i wo n't argue . 
  it has since been `` privatized '' to a degree , but it 's still majority state-owned . 
   always far less corruption involved because ultimately the people at the top still have to provide transparent data to investors if only that was true . 
  i do n't really need to look hard to find examples that proves my point . 
  enron for example ? 
   odds are the private corporations are cheaper and more efficient than the state-owned ones because this has always been the case in every industry .
