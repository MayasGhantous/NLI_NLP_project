   the somalians did n't chose , there were a lot of somalian refugees and norway no , not really , this is a chicken and egg situation . 
  there were n't any somalians here before the refugees started coming . 
  which is sort of the point , when did they originally choose us ? 
  it 's random that they ended up here of all places , but your suggestion is partly true . 
  we did give them asylum , but so did most places for the same reasons ? 
   nowdays i guess is just the natural call , since there are somalians already living there . 
  yes , it would be , except we do n't grant them asylum as easily any longer . 
  now , they might as well not come here , and they rather try sweden . 
  maybe because of our generous welfare systems ? 
  we did have a fairly liberal asylum policy for somalians a few years back . 
  the swedes are still very liberal and now even more so for syrians . 
  i 've always found it strange to note that the most scandinavian of us states has received the most somalian refugees . 
   the ecj has their judges appointed rather than elected , as in many countries . 
  i for one prefer my judges to be appointed rather than elected . 
  a judge elected by the people sounds `` democratic '' , but what kind of judge would that be ? 
  most icelanders look nothing like bj\u00f6rk though . 
  they 're not inuits . 
  it is both amusing and terrifying , but then again i do n't believe a system that * claims * to be `` gold-based '' is much better , 
  even under the articles of confederation , the central government 's power was quite limited ? 
  congress lacked enforcement powers , and they did n't even have the power to tax . 
  it was the states that decided and gave funds if/when requested . 
  that 's the current status in the european union . 
  yeah , of course , it ca n't be done without some suffering . 
  i suppose the question is what would you rather have ? 
  you have been paying youth to move to norway ? 
  it actually fell , the forecast was for a small increase and instead it fell ... http://e24.no/makro-og-politikk/ssb-arbeidsledigheten-faller/22682695, 
  it would take time to equalize and adjust , but eventually it would lead to a more stable and prosperous union for all . 
  i think it 's even more serious for the us today , if texas or alaska attempted to seceed the consequences for the us economy would be serious and the fall out near fatal for the world 's economy . 
  imagine the world 's reaction to the recent banking crisis many times over !, 
  it 's not a matter of just losing land or resources ; it would be losing political stability in a world that relies on the us dollar . 
  without stability the dollar would plummet , interest rates crash , banks would sink , markets would tremble . 
   all the 13 colonies natively spoke english the upper echelons did certainly . 
  that may seem important , but i doubt the common man cared or mattered much at the time . 
  there was n't a great deal of inter-colony flow of people by comparison . 
  the colonies readily accepted immigrants from europe without regard for their background , and they found a way to communicate when needed . 
  i believe the inital colonies were mostly settled by the english and their scottish , welsh and irish workers ; each with their own [ non-english ] languages to be precise . 
   should we expect something like a use in the next century or two ? 
  i expect it will evolve in that direction , mostly due to global competition and the need to use our resources more effectively . 
  i 'm not advocating either way , as my country har rejected the eu twice . 
  europeans are quite capable of competing . 
  just look at germany 's exports , [ they 're set to export more than the us ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20130816/51437 ) !, 
  however , we 're all spending far too much on separate solutions to common problems ( security/military , immigration , transport networks , communication networks , diplomacy and embassies etc ) . 
  the eu has done a great deal to ease and force open trade between member states . 
  which has resulted in lower prices for consumers , more competition between old incumbents and national champions . 
  the result is better utilization of limited resources within europe , but also for products exported abroad . 
   i mean , it wo n't be more than a few generations before virtually all eu citizens are fluent in english , i suppose that might happen , we 're quite proficient as it is , but you seem to think that means we will speak and use english internally ? 
  that 's a mistake , our languages will not die or be replaced by english . 
  the minute i leave this page i will resume speaking in my native language to my friends and family . 
   multiple factors are dissolving cultural barriers between europe 's peoples . 
  this is a seriously flawed observation , argument and conclusion . 
  i could write books on the subject , in the end it comes down to the fact that we 're not united but divided by our disparate cultural , ethnic , historic , geographic/climatic , religious and linguistic backgrounds . 
  issues i believe will persist , not despite google , but thanks to digital support . 
  while it 's easy for a polish man to emigrate to the uk , or an italian to sweden , they 're far from natural fits or natives . 
  there 's a reason you can hire cultural guides in places like china ; and [ why the economist has podcasts for `` doing business in '' ] ( http://podgallery.org/economist-doing-business-in/ ) . 
  for that matter i doubt you will ever have an italian man as prime minister of the uk , unless he 's native born and raised . 
  while an american can move to another state , stand for election and represent them in congress !, 
  even the eu 's predecessor , the [ european coal and steel community ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_coal_and_steel_community ) , strikes me as more integrated than the original us was . 
  interestingly , you picked * the one * group that only recently ( 2013 ) were recognized as a ethnic and cultural group ... [ in the eyes of us courts ], 
   us was established as a new country as a consequence of gaining independence while in eu case the countries would lose their independence from geopolitical point of view . 
  this was n't the case of the `` original '' us i wrote about above . 
  the original us states were more like european nations than simply member states of a federation . 
  this changed over time and the american federalists had to fight hard to get where they are now . 
  [ this xkcd graphic shows it well ] ( http://xkcd.com/1127/ ) . 
  this was the case after the civil war , in fact it was this `` original '' us i thought about above . 
  i believe it was lincoln that famously wrote that he wished to return to his country/state , but i ca n't remember the source ? 
  i think context matters , when asked where an american is from it matters if he 's abroad or not . 
   essentially , the federal government can now use the commerce clause to issue legislation on anything in the us , which is not , constitutionally , how the us was designed to work . 
  while you anglo-americans have mostly common law-based justice systems , it 's not a foreign concept for us students of law in civil law ( roman ) countries ; i.e. 
  a majority of the world 's countries . 
  to us the law is meant be expanded upon as needed , especially over time or by practical needs . 
  so while i understand why you disagree your objection , i.e. 
  `` designed to work '' , it seems rather pointless to me . 
  in fact it 's how i foresee the eu advancing towards a federal nation state * without * democratic support and referenda . 
  the peoples of europe would not vote in favor of a stronger union !, 
  nevermind if it 's because they favor independence , abhor waste or simply hate `` politicians '' . 
  my country is not a member of the eu so it matters little to me . 
  however , i see no hope for the european federalists without such `` creative '' advancement of the union . 
  very gradual change , over a long period of time . 
  ah , thanks , i forgot about that group . 
  i 'm sure mrjmaxted will find it interesting . 
  yes , in a nutshell . 
  the `` efficiency '' is another matter . 
  yes , but if i were to sum it up ; [ the commerce clause ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commerce_clause ) shows how it has developed . 
  the eu is already a `` federal '' entity , but more often described as supra-national due to its unique status . 
  i suppose you mean * one * federal state at the expense of each nation 's sovereignty ? 
  i do n't know any movements in the ep itself , but outside of it there are supporters : - [ jeunes europ\u00e9ens f\u00e9d\u00e9ralistes ] ( http://www.jef.eu/ ) ( jef ) is a europe-wide organization . 
  the goal of jef is the creation of a democratic european federation . 
  - [ the european movement ] ( http://www.europeanmovement.eu/ ) is an organization with members in most european countries . 
  its objective is to `` contribute to the establishment of a united , federal europe founded on the principles of peace , democracy , liberty , solidarity , and respect for basic human rights . 
   are there any lighter alternatives that allow for greater coordination of member states without affecting their autonomy ? 
  the uk left the efta alternative which was more trade focused . 
  interestingly the current status of the eu looks a lot like the original us ; a union of nation states . 
   apparently , this is common in norway - mocking the opponents ' weight . 
  firsly , it does sound really bad . 
  however , your statement is taking things too far . 
  i might not have watched all of these matches , but now you 're just making things up . 
  one or two incidents does n't make it a rule , you know ? 
  yeah , but even then it does n't make a lot of sense , as we probably continued to share intelligence with the other allies after the war . 
   when a truck causes about 10,000 times more damage than a car . 
  interestingly , a recent norwegian transport economics study found that cars had practically no effect on the roads at all , [ it was all down to the heavy trucks ] ( http://e24.no/bil/bare-tungtransport-sliter-norske-veier/22587695 ) .
