  maybe he was describing the people from mosj\u00f8en ? 
  i hear it 's quite rough !, 
   former governing party the center party ( sp ) is in crisis , and severe politicians demands leader navarsete 's departure . 
  that 's giving them a bit much status . 
  here 's my take : - a former coalition government member , the center party ( agriculturalist party ) , is cleaning house after disastrous election results . 
  norway was a founding member of nato , `` since we joined '' seems a bit redundant . 
  hmm , i thought he simply commented that the one really big player `` had n't missed any meals lately '' . 
  it 's `` finland '' in english , 
  i thought the elections proved that ... 25 % for a former giant is saying a lot , is n't it ? 
  it does sound lovely , but it 's illegal today , 
  i hope it gets better , 
  it was a law in all of scandinavia at one point that you had to brew beer for christmas . 
  failure to do so resulted in fines or confiscation of your land . 
  oh , just like norway then . 
   because of these issues , they 're nowhere near ready to join the eu . 
  the irony is that the ruling j&d party has goals that are incompatible with joining the eu . 
  they ca n't fulfill their goal of a religious society without coming into conflict with fundamental eu treaties . 
  turkey joining the eu is a pipe dream if there ever was one . 
   turkey often runs air missions over northern iraq to take out pkk targets ( most people dont know this is going on ) . 
  yeah , i 've noted that particular conflict is far from the headlines . 
  the pkk incident in paris however was widely publicized . 
  i wonder why ... 
  surely , there 's no bias or silent support for the nato ally gov ` t , hehe . 
   there were protests all around the city and people at my hotel told me not to go outside because i was `` too white . '', 
  it just goes to show how illogical humans in general can be . 
  was it possibly `` tribalism '' applied to other peoples ( pl ) . 
  i remember the threats against france as a whole , for a murder that happened on their soil . 
  a rather strange threat to hear for someone like me , who lives in a multi-cultural society , how can a people / `` race '' / tribe be held accountable for a murder ? 
  it boggles my mind . 
   i was blown away how far they have come as a previously oppressed minority in a relatively short time . 
  yes , they 've done quite well . 
  i believe the kurdish regions of iraq were off limits to the regime even before the invasion so they have had time to build . 
  yeah , which is probably the result of a long standing gov ' t policy . 
  though i understand there has been some changes lately . 
  keeping the kurds down has been vital for the turkish state , with the wars in iraq and now syria it 's obvious why . 
  the turkish gov ' t is justifiably worried about losing large parts to a kurdish state spanning iraq , syria and turkey ( and more ) . 
  if they choose to invest and develop the eastern region they would probably have less problems and separatists there . 
  stick meet carrot , i guess . 
  nice theory . 
  the paper is n't that interesting , not as much as the annual payout from owning those shares . 
  we trade them , we 're not sitting on them , you know ? 
  there 's money to be made simply trading and reinvesting . 
  any sufficiently large city will `` spawn '' its own markets for services and products ; both legal and illegal . 
  the weak , poor or recently arrived always bear the brunt of the abuse . 
  the flipside is that you also find the wealthiest and most educated people there . 
  good jobs for many , bad and low paying jobs for even more [ especially the illegals/disenfranchised ] . 
  by contrast `` village life '' usually gives you some security , because at least you have personal relationships with your neighbors and often an extended family nearby . 
  there 's possibly even `` public '' welfare ( local gov ` t , churches , neighbors etc ) . 
  modern welfare states try to compensate . 
  the big city ( tm ) inevitably brings out the worst in a minority of humans . 
  i 'm not saying it ca n't be defeated in time , but most cities in our history have seen labor slaves , forced prostitutes , child abuse , murders , lots of crime and an inequitable distribution of wealth . 
  hehe , i 'm just arguing that it could be detrimental to the rest of europe if another competitive and developed nation became a member . 
  competition is bad if you lose your job . 
   so iceland is part of europe in the same way as australia or canada . 
  `` european culture '' was exported there , it did not develop individually exported ? 
  well , it was empty when we settled it . 
  i do n't think it 's quite the same as australia or canada in that sense ( aboriginals/inuits ) . 
  turkey is well developed , but it 's not equally distributed . 
  the eastern regions of turkey are far less developed and supported by their gov ` t. 
  that 's incidentally where the fighting happens between the gov ' t and kurdish population . 
  note that they are still quite poor , as a whole , compared with northern europe , and much of their poplation is obviously willing to migrate ... nevermind the fact that their industry has lower costs !, 
  do you think the eu needs another poland/romania in the system at this point ? 
  it does give rise to unfortunate social problems ? 
  well , it 's not as if [ we spend the money ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/business/21586268-changes-norways-gigantic-sovereign-wealth-fund-will-be-felt-around-world-more-money ) . 
  we now own 1,25 % of the world 's shares and an average of 2,5 % of every european listed company . 
  what kind of idiot are you ? 
  the ahlc is obviously not a secret , that 's state funding for the pa 's civil employees . 
  your claims are lunacy . 
  even israel disagrees with you . 
  i prefer the other argument ; we invented everything important today . 
  while that might be partially true ( cell phones , cpus etc ) , that is n't an argument for supporting them regardless . 
  china is more interesting than israel in that regard . 
   1,000,000,000 people will produce more innovation . 
  i 'm sure we have some of our own in that category here in europe , 
  maybe . 
  i 'm sure they think and say different things in private . 
  please , stop voting them into congress . 
  we get it , he 's just a little troll . 
  it 's reddit , 
  here 's the thing with your claim that `` everybody '' does it ... q : does france spy on us citizens ** in the us ** ? 
  a : no . 
  however the us spies on french citizens in france . 
  that is not the same at all !, 
  sorry , i forgot to answer , but yes i did get to watch the program on dr. 
  thanks !, 
  it was indeed on `` skavlan '' . 
  norwegian public broadcasting cut down the rant before broadcasting , which made even bigger headlines in sweden ... 
  if only we did have the solution . 
  okay , i suppose once the major issues are resolved your country will have fewer and less interesting news items to report , 
  i wonder how it was 20-50 years ago ? 
  is it cultural or just the current crisis ? 
  we like to talk about the weather up here , but it does n't mean we actually * dislike * it , 
  oh , yes , i know the russians ( banks ) etc. 
  it 's just so `` lively '' a country from what i 've gathered , after reading your posts here , 
  ** norway ** - the [ new conservative coalition government took power ] ( http://www.regjeringen.no/en.html?id=4 ) after a deal was reached between the parties . 
  - the populist , anti-tax progress party ( [ conservative/libertarian ] ( http://www.frp.no/nor/the-progress-party/principles ) ) has never been in government before . 
  european media describes the progress party as `` anti-immigration '' and racist , despite it being quite mainstream in reality . 
  wolf !, 
  wolf !, 
  norway despairs .
