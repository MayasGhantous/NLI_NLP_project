  - a norwegian citizen , originally a refugee from somalia , has been linked to the terror attack in nairobi ( kenya ) . 
  the suspect left norway years ago and is now wanted for questioning internationally . 
  - norway has been asked to receive and destroy syrian wmds ( as part of the un/us/russia deal ) . 
  - a norwegian/swedish talk show featured the former pm of norway and a swedish comedian of extra-european ethnicity ( relevant ) . 
  like most swedes the comedian has a rather poor understanding of norway 's political parties and/or suggested policies . 
  the comedian ranted on public tv and accused norway of `` racism '' for daring to suggest that visiting romanian citizens of roma descent , many of which have been convicted of crimes , be expelled and sent home . 
  norwegians in general are puzzled and question swedish people 's `` politically correct '' culture . 
  - norwegian charities and churches have asked for money from the government to help poor europeans coming to norway . 
  many of these people have ended up sleeping on the street . 
  the new government has rejected the notion that they deserve our help : `` eu citizens are welcome to settle in norway if they can find a job , they are not entitled to welfare benefits before that under the eea agreement '' . 
  many of these people only have * residency permits * in italy and spain and have no legal access to norway without a european citizenship . 
  - the [ new foreign minister of norway , b\u00f8rge brende ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%b8rge_brende ) , has close ties to china , after having worked for a chinese government 's advisory board . 
  he was the managing director of the world economic forum until now , and knows the chinese leadership personally . 
  it is hoped he will improve the strained relationship with china after the nobel peace prize to [ liu xiaobo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liu_xiaobo ) in 2010 . 
  there 's just * too much * happening in your country ... what is up with that ? 
  the retailer decides the exchange rate for the transaction if you let them . 
  let 's say i buy an item for $ 100 in spain . 
  if i choose to use my card and select `` norwegian crowns ( nok ) '' the shop will decide the exact exchange rate . 
  so instead of getting my bank 's rate ( 1 eur = 8,10 nok ) , i might get charged ( 1 eur = 9 nok ) . 
  yeah , i realized afterwards that it might be better to reverse it . 
  however i was first and foremost thinking about recommending vienna and budapest . 
  prague was an afterthought , last but certainly not least . 
  every tourist visiting europe should see the capitals of austria-hungary , 
  well , it 's not the [ cold ] climate itself that 's the problem , it 's what you 'll miss !, 
   the wonderful street life on a summer 's eve in italy , or the wonderful never-ending days up here in scandinavia . 
  visiting the netherlands or france without seeing it in all its glory is a real shame !, 
  london is always grey , hehe , but it 's much more fun during summer . 
  it does n't quite feel right sending someone to paris during fall or winter - without having experienced spring or summer there . 
  it 's like going on a date without a girl ... oh , how i could go on , the list would be megabytes worth of text !, 
  it does and i considered mentioning it , 
  in that case you probably need a whole book of tips . 
  european countries are far from uniform in culture , economy or crime . 
  what applies in one country is far from valid in the next . 
  the difference between the sweden and bulgaria is like canada and mexico . 
  - do n't ever change money with people on the street , they 'll always trick you and i 'm not talking about the exchange rate . 
  - using atms is recommended ( exchange rates ) but always check that there 's no extra card reader installed by criminals . 
  - if paying for items in a store using a credit card , where you can choose currency , always pick the local currency . 
  otherwise they 'll charge you using a disfavorable exchange rate . 
  yeah and pornography is almost like sex , hehe . 
  absolutely !, 
  i could n't agree more , but that 's why you need the contrasts of big and small . 
  you ca n't fully see the charm of a tiny french village without having seen the grand boulevards filled with busy , * haute couture * people , 
  two million * metro * is still far from london or paris . 
  oslo is even smaller . 
  copenhagen is a city close to my heart , but it 's also a very different culture from europe in general . 
  there 's a reason denmark ranks high on the world 's happiest country list  i prefer nice myself , but france is great in most ways . 
   copenhagen is positively awesome . 
  yeah , i 'm not sure it qualifies in the category of big city ( tm ) with only < 600,000 citizens and a metro area of 1-2 mill . 
  it 's also a very friendly city in general because of * danes * , 
  watch out for pick pockets and/or luggage stealers on the trains ... well dressed `` businessmen '' even . 
  there 's a name for that experience ... 
  however it 's great to see those rather important cities at least once . 
  you wo n't find the same impressive buildings in minor cities , but that 's why you have to visit both large and small places to experience other cultures , 
  yeah , that 's what i 'm * subtly * asking about  otherwise i thought it a little `` uninformed '' to visit during winter [ for some parts of europe ] . 
   the disdain of a people who do n't even like the french , unless they are parisian . 
  yeah , i do n't think that 's any different from other big cities ( tm ) . 
  if you visit new york , london or moscow , i doubt you would come back feeling any different . 
  at least the attitudes are perfectly `` logical '' ; as natives treat tourists the same way in most big cities , in my rather extensive experience . 
  - the disdain is usually because `` tourists '' , of any sort , do n't obey the local customs and unspoken rules . 
  - people from other american states are easily spotted in new york , the same applies to other french citizens visiting paris ... dog shit , really ? 
  that 's a major point in paris ' disfavor ? 
  come on . 
  they have street patrols picking that up regularly . 
  if you had the time i would visit vienna , [ train to ] budapest and [ fly to ] prague . 
  that sounds a bit harsh . 
  paris is nice , but big cities are brutal . 
  i think he meant ** 10 ** days in europe , but he 's leaving in 4 months time , 
  you picked an odd time to fly here ? 
  does n't it just underline how important their work was , when you can so easily determine that it was going to win ? 
  if you ask you 'll change the results !, 
  ( observer effect ), 
  thank you for asking the * right * question !, 
  yes , your point is fair , however my original statement was `` lidl is not * literally * found all over europe '' . 
  then you disputed my claim ... saying i was misinformed . 
  oh , you have this the wrong way around . 
  - svalbard is an internal region of norway - norway is part of the eea and schengen - svalbard is subject to int ' l treaties svalbard is open to the world by treaty , that 's why it 's ** not ** restricted to holders of schengen visas . 
  however flying to svalbard requires access to norway . 
  so it 's still norway , but not schengen . 
  you need yet another color !, 
   let me quote the svalbard governor : `` although the norwegian mainland is part of the schengen area , svalbard is not . 
  norwegian authorities do ** not ** require a visa for visiting svalbard in itself , but as most transport links connect svalbard with norway , foreigners with visa requirements to norway/the schengen area will need a valid visa to travel through the schengen area . '', 
  it seems to me that norway has a `` third '' pattern/color that is not listed in the legend . 
  look at [ this comparison of iceland and norway ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vcsasxf.jpg ), 
  why did you not apply norway 's colors to svalbard ? 
  it 's an * integral * part of the kingdom . 
  you also missed [ jan mayen ] ( http://arcticcentre.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/map.jpg ) and [ bear island ( bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/bjornoya_location_map-en.svg/478px-bjornoya_location_map-en.svg.png ) . 
  the list is per capita , so you 're drinking for more than one citizen . 
  they 're the one 's pulling the average down !, 
   i think you are misinformed about lidl in europe are you sure you read that list ? 
   let me quote it : - norway `` 50 stores ** sold ** to reitangruppen on 2008 . 
  now rema 1000 stores '' or was your point unrelated to my comment ? 
  the list shows that lidl is clearly not in all of europe , not even close . 
  thanks !, 
  what country would this be ? 
   that 's exactly like aldi and lidl ( german stores found all over europe and even some in the states ) . 
  they are super cheap but the overall quality is fine . 
  interestingly , lidl is * not * literally found all over europe , they failed when they tried to establish themselves in norway recently . 
  apparently it was n't a good match . 
  i suspect it 's a combination of reddit 's automatic vote `` salting '' and lonely trolls . 
  i do n't think the english speaking world understands `` bolche '' , but hard candy does the trick ,
