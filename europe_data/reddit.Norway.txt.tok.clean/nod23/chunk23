  hehe , sounds like a competition . 
  i prefer my coffee black . 
  oooh , i love dutch liquorice !, 
  every time my father went there on business he would bring back a box . 
  it was like christmas !, 
  is n't it silly ? 
  they probably do n't even like dried , salted or rotten fish !, 
  relevant . 
  scandinavia consumes the most coffee in the world !, 
  finland drinks the most . 
  yeah , that 's what i thought , but maybe it 's a fitting exit that you 're screwing yourselves this time , hehe , 
  haha , you literally ca n't even spell the * prize * . 
  i did n't ask for your opinion and you hardly seem very knowledgeable on the subject either ; see arguments like `` fuck it up '' . 
  it 's more than another reward for good behavior , it 's a political tool ... 
  even if you do n't understand or like it . 
  go suck a `` currywurst '' !, 
  fyi nobel 's testament gave norway the responsibility . 
  do n't worry , lots of norwegians do n't like it either ( old , ex-politicians decide it , after they leave politics ) . 
   anyone can nominate literally wrong . 
  the norwegian nobel committee explicitly said that they were hoping to * dissuade * obama from starting new wars and hopefully making him end the pre-existing operations . 
  it was n't because of his many `` achievements '' . 
  the prize is often given to * `` encourage '' * the right actions ... ( see plo , russia etc ) . 
  only in part was it given because he embodied us democracy , and him being the first mixed/non-white president was laudable in itself . 
  hehe , yes , there is that of course . 
  they do n't define european borders , even if they extend the european union [ to varying degrees ] . 
  we would n't expect anyone to give up territory to join , would we ? 
  some of the british , spanish , dutch and french islands are * not * part of the eu . 
  while there is no clear definition of europe , many of them draw the line in istanbul . 
  the border with iraq is quite far from the bosphorus , but even further from * the culture * of european nations . 
  really ? 
  a sensible bully then , because the odds have n't changed . 
  repeating the same behavior over and over again , and expecting different results ... morrocco tried to join the eu once , it gave up after it was rejected . 
  now , that was a clear message . 
  so there 's that difference . 
  turkey is just being `` entertained '' since the us pushed ** hard ** during the cold war for its strategically placed * nato ally * turkey . 
  even going as far as publically calling for turkey 's inclusion lately [ after a turkish request ] . 
  the cold war is over , so while the us still has use for turkey 's bases , europe does n't see the same value in nato any longer ( see the eu 's own battlegroups etc ) . 
  is it screwing the british or french if the uk leaves the eu now ? 
   that was due to the french and not because of romania . 
  i did n't say it was ... that was just the * most recent * major scandal . 
  the fact that romania was involved in the meat scandal meant little to me . 
  the point was that laws are there to protect consumers from such problems . 
  the laws are n't always helpful , but their intentions are usually good . 
  the notion that a lack of regulations is good , is terribly naive . 
   romania also has a lot of cultural events please , you 're missing the point !, 
  where do the major artists go ** most often ** ? 
  they go to the larger cities like london , paris etc. 
  i 'm not saying romania is dead or culture-less !, 
  i 'm not even doubting you get some major names now and then . 
  would n't you agree that berlin is * more likely * to have * more * big name artists show up ? 
  where do artists thrive ? 
  where there 's an audience and money . 
  do you even know the cultural scene and variety in berlin ? 
  it 's on another level !, 
   your post is full of smugness and alludes that romania is a backwards place full of stupid people . 
  actually , it * does n't * - but you 're too silly and read into it what you [ dis - ] liked . 
  i have no negative illusions about romania itself !, 
  in fact i work with a romanian subsidiary of my employer ... my family has been on vacation there . 
  the problem is that you wrongly think i 'm ignorant of your country . 
  however , honestly i would rather live in berlin than bucharest for a number of reasons !, 
  do n't take it so personally , it 's not a horrible insult !, 
   i 'm not jewish , but it 's generally the mother is jewish , then the son is jewish . 
  the israelis are n't exactly making it hard for jews to come `` home '' . 
  there 's more to it than that . 
  i happen to be of jewish stock myself . 
  the point being jews are not foreign entities that should have to leave europe . 
  we 've already had a war over that . 
   already asked , and answered . 
  if you take the medical procedure away , you 're also effectively attacking religious freedoms . 
  if you open the way like this , the next question has to be what other harm does a religion cause ? 
  is the indoctrination so bad , it has to stop as well ? 
  it does n't stop at the procedure because you say so . 
  i 'm afraid you would have to ask estonia , russia or nato . 
  i doubt anyone will answer you truthfully . 
  would you expect anyone to leave behind clear evidence ? 
  pissed off individuals ? 
  let 's hear what nato command says : - without naming russia , [ the nato official said ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia ) : `` i wo n't point fingers . 
  but these were ** not ** things done by a few individuals . 
  let me just point out that following the attacks of 2007 nato established the [ cooperative cyber defence centre of excellence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cooperative_cyber_defence_centre_of_excellence ) in estonia ... 
  i wonder why , 
  to be fair it 's also the consequences of world wide problems . 
  the us banking crisis , eu debt crisis and chinese slow-down were unavoidable for such a central country as the uk . 
  unpredictable ? 
  well . 
   i 'm not a lawyer , but their law of return pretty much makes it easy peasy for them to get israeli citizenship . 
  i can tell . 
  the very definition of who is jewish is by no means clear or answered , even in israel . 
  so , no , it 's not that easy . 
   people who want to drag europe down to their level can fuck right off . 
  that 's fairly typical of the average european . 
  i do n't wholly disagree either . 
   i do n't believe parents have any liberty to harm their children , the question is what is `` harmful '' ? 
  how harmful is enough ? 
  is religion * in itself * harmful ? 
  what about political views ( neo-nazi or communist parents ) ? 
  at this point we 're clearly talking about fundamental rights . 
  yeah , but the joke was everyone blames someone else for their problems . 
  the uk is no different in that regard , and at this very moment the british pm is working towards a referendum on leaving the eu for those very same reasons !, 
  the uk is in dire straits , but i do n't see greece rushing to leave the eu ? 
  held liable ?
