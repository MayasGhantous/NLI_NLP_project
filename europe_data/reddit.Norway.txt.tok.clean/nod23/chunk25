  yes , but it 's also a long-standing tradition , with an emphasis on family , celebrating the person 's coming of age , it 's an important rite of passage . 
  the next stage is conscription and national service . 
  the sums of money have grown because of our general wealth levels . 
  most `` young adults '' put it towards something useful or save most of it . 
  it really improves your quality of life if you can buy your first moped/scooter , especially when you 're stuck living a few miles from the nearest village center , school or shops . 
  norway is a big and rural country ( physically larger than the uk ) . 
  it facilitates `` social interaction '' at a crucial point in time for young people , 
   how else do you imagine it , a five-year-old `` deciding '' if it should have surgery ? 
  i 'll tell you how it 's done . 
  it 's called a * legal guardian * . 
  appointed by the state or a court . 
  they 're often appointed to be independent caretakers of childrens interests when the parents are either incapable or unavailable . 
  even # 450 would be small change compared with what kids get in norway after confirmation ( lutheran ) !, 
  - i remember getting around 10,000-15 ,000 nok ( # 1500 | $ 2500 | $ 1851 ) . 
  - today kids can get more than 50,000 nok ( ~ $ 8340 ) in cash , jewelry , shares or goods ( mopeds , bikes , computers , etc ) !, 
  [ explanation for those who do n't know confirmations or scandinavian traditions ] ( http://edithmills.blogspot.no/2013/05/benedictes-confirmation.html ) . 
  it was n't very common until modern times however , and the claims made in support of circumcision were rather strange . 
  - `` by the 1890s , hernia , bladder infections , ** kidney stones ** , insomnia , chronic indigestion , rheumatism , ** epilepsy ** , asthma , bedwetting , bright 's disease , erectile dysfunction , syphilis , ** insanity ** , and skin cancer had all been linked to the foreskin ... '' estimates of infant circumcision rates in the united states holds that 30 % of newborn american boys were being circumcised in 1900 , 55 % in 1925 , and 72 % in 1950 . 
  the keyword here being `` religion '' . 
  if the tattoo was of a religious nature it would probably also be allowed . 
  the person who could perform the surgery or tattoo in question would be under no obligation to do so . 
  strictly speaking , the person making that decision ( penis mutilation ) has to be an adult ( see parent ) . 
  the child has no legal standing yet , the parents are his legal guardians ( * foreldre/foresatte/verge * ) . 
  they answer for his actions and are liable . 
  so it 's not correct to say there 's `` no limit '' . 
  the problem is where do we draw the line in legal terms ? 
  this is a complex matter . 
  the international attention , political pressures and historic context ( pogroms/holocaust/discrimination ) is not entirely irrelevant . 
  most europeans have constitutional rights , legal texts and precedents that support their right to decide on behalf of their children . 
  ultimately the echr draws the line . 
  it 's not a matter of simply canceling the existing laws or creating new legislation . 
  how far should the state go in protecting the rights of children against their parents ? 
  undue political or religious influence ? 
  why should we stop at `` removing foreskin '' ? 
  bad mothers ? 
  bad genes ? 
  is a family history of alcoholism reason enough ? 
  how about council housing , dole recipients , asbos , poor grades , lack of higher education or unskilled parents ? 
  at what point should the state remove children from their parents ' care and responsibility ? 
  the current guideline is `` what is in the best interest of the child ? '' . 
  it 's a slippery slope if we start considering when and what a parent should be allowed to decide . 
  we do n't have to * legislate * in all matters of morals and ethics . 
  i for one would very much like to see a full ban on such medical procedures on children . 
  let them choose when they 're adults . 
  yes , that 's the problem . 
  i fully agree with you , it 's not morally correct , but * the law * says otherwise . 
  parents ** do ** decide their children 's religion !, 
  most european [ christians ] baptize their children for example . 
  are you speaking for * your * jurisdiction or every other country in the world ? 
  we do n't even share the same legal systems ; germany/scandinavia ( see bgb ) versus the uk . 
  no , i agree , the child should n't have to make that decision at all . 
  it should in fact be put off until the boy is an adult or somewhat older ( 16-18 years old ) . 
  the problem is that children do n't have protections from this yet . 
  a ban would solve it , but restrict religious freedoms . 
   if ever , the procedure needs to be done only to adults in full control of their faculties . 
  yes , we agree , however at present there is no such law granting the child freedom to resist his parents wishes . 
  that 's what the judge faces in court , he ca n't deny the parents their rights , but the child does n't have sufficient protection . 
  yes , we all have various exceptions to the main rule . 
  for example : children can actively choose to live mainly with either divorced parent in my country . 
  my implicit point was that it was one of those issues where children either get to decide themselves , or perhaps the issue is so serious it should n't be performed on children at all ( ! ), 
  it 's better if they choose when they 're 16 or 18 . 
  yes , as in most countries . 
  however , i should perhaps have said , it should be one of those issues where minors decide themselves [ or perhaps ca n't decide until they 're adults ] . 
  perhaps neither parents or children should be allowed to do so until adulthood ? 
  no , i 'm pretty sure this applies in most jurisdictions . 
  unless children are emancipated they 're unable to consent ( see : sign contracts etc ) . 
  there are * exceptions * , for example with regards to sex , 16 year olds in scandinavia are legally able to have sex - but they 're not adults . 
  yes , this makes a lot of sense . 
  children should be allowed to choose if they want to do it after they 're mature enough to understand . 
  i believe the amish , hutterites and other * less archaic * groups let their children choose to join as adults ? 
  [ the baptists obviously take this very seriously ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/believer's_baptism ) . 
  yep . 
  did you see [ the unfortunate comic from norway on the subject ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1166226/thumbs/o-jewish-cartoon-570.jpg?6 ) ? 
  yeah , which is the point they 're also sort of making , 
  i wonder if you meant that sentence literally . 
  the jewish tradition was obviously present in germany prior to the turks , more to the point it 's not very `` german '' either . 
  i would have phrased it differently : `` cirmcumcision in germany is usually done by turkish ethnic muslims according to their tradition . '', 
  it 's usually done much earlier , at least for jewish boys . 
  brit milah is performed on the eighth day of a boy 's life . 
  the judge in the case put * the child 's * rights above the parents religious freedoms , as it should be . 
  the problem is that a child can not legally consent . 
  no matter what . 
  the parents are legal guardians and at the moment they * legally * have the right to decide over their childrens bodies . 
  i do n't agree with that , but it 's factual . 
  i think that 's part of the point . 
  should parents really take this kind of decision without the childs informed consent ? 
  to quote the article : `` the court decided that a child 's right to * self-determination * superceded his parents ' right to freedom of religion . '', 
  or perhaps more to the point , a child * can not * legally consent ... [ so perhaps this should be put off until the child is an adult ] . 
  yeah , but that comic is about creating new standards . 
  the eu is wisely enough only * mandating * one , pre-existing standard , 
  i must admit i have not heard of the payments in question . 
  i thought you meant our swf fund divesting from israeli companies involved in weapons and construction of the wall . 
  i can understand why those payments would be bigger news in israel than here . 
  we think we 're being nice by helping the palestinians , where the money ends up is another issue ... a little bit na\u00efve , i know . 
   the modern term of settlers apply to any jewish person who lives cross the green line . 
  good point . 
  given the context i should have used another term . 
  however i was actually thinking about the people who effectively took control over israeli territory before and after 1948 . 
  personally , i see no reason to complain about what happened , it 's * fait accompli * now . 
  we ca n't go back and adjust borders and move people because of past injustices .
