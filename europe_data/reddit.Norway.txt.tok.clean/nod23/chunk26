  europe is a prime example of that , so i do n't see why anyone expects israel to be different . 
  swedish police : stopping crime everywhere . 
  - in other news swedish police officers reported their own speeding ... - s&m websites show a marked increase in visits from swedish police stations, 
  how interesting , i 'm a civil law jurist myself , that last part was really the issue i wondered about . 
  i hope you do n't mind my questions , but i thought there might be an issue in translating the legal term from hewbrew to english . 
  is it your opinion that one or more of those variations listed applied to the situation ? 
  did the person in question get `` detained '' in any form that would conflict with the vienna convention ? 
  i assume israeli media has told you more details than i have access to . 
   there is no `` religious law '' in israel in most common definitions i only meant to properly describe the system , as neither fully common law or civil law . 
  yeah , i agree it 's a lot of nonsense and media ca n't be trusted to be neutral or understand properly in all cases . 
  the blame lies with many different people . 
  however , i believe most of these cases are nothing but simple political tools to discredit so-called `` opponents '' ( such as scandinavia ) . 
  i truly find it amusing , as i understand it in the context of the great game . 
  discrediting a country in the press might lead to less support for any legitimate opposition . 
   when ever oslo related terrorist event happen we get the `` terrorist released for oslo or during oslo sure , it is only natural for israelis to feel that way . 
  the palestinians feel similarly cheated . 
  neither party got 100 % of what they wanted and have an easy target for scapegoating . 
  why not ? 
  it 's no skin off my nose . 
   ahlc yeah , i imagine supporting the `` enemy '' can be seen as unhelpful or hostile . 
   we had learned about the actions of norwegian `` funds '' and it kinda slapped our faces . 
  yes , i can understand that , however it was done purely on the basis of divesting from anything related to the separation wall . 
  the hague court verdict that it was illegal , made our investments potentially a liability . 
   that was going on way before there had been any occupation yes , i 've even heard the `` new historians '' talk about your history . 
  there is a lot to learn and read about israel 's past . 
  i for one do n't object to the settlers effectively kicking the arabs out after 1948 , that 's how humans have always done it . 
  what 's the point in complaining about spilt milk ? 
   `` finish/norway/danish '' activists had been lumped into one yes , it 's quite common and easy to lump as all together . 
  it does look a bit strange when newspapers accept outrageous accusations in their opinion pieces . 
  freedom of press is great , but what about truth and accuracy ? 
  the corrections page is usually hidden , hehe . 
   i actually was n't aware of that see the cold war , but not limited to that period . 
  violation of the law by diplomats has included espionage , smuggling , child custody law violations , and even murder : - in london in 1984 , policewoman yvonne fletcher was killed on the street by a person shooting from inside the libyan embassy . 
   wether the vehicle cc/cd/dd or not what ? 
  the vienna convention on diplomatic relations protects the diplomat * himself * regardless of his vehicle or abode . 
  - article 29 . 
  diplomats must ** not ** be liable to any form of arrest or detention . 
  they are immune from civil or criminal prosecution , though the sending country may waive this right under article 32 . 
  under article 34 , they are exempt from most taxes , and under article 36 they are exempt from most customs duties . 
  the family members of a diplomat that are living in the host country enjoy most of the same protections as the diplomats themselves . 
   detainment has a legal term ( like arrest and indice ) are you sure you understand the mixed jurisdiction of civil law ( roman ) , common law and religious law of countries such as israel ? 
    i think you give too much credit to diplomatic relations that depends on the guest nation i suppose . 
  it 's not in the nation 's best interest to have such people in their employ . 
  i suspect at least the european countries in question will censure or recall some staff . 
  reading israeli newspapers online i beg to differ ( english and hewbrew translations ) . 
  i understand why it happens , mostly for political reasons and often based on some serious lies/untruths . 
  examples : - i especially `` enjoy '' reading how norway is evil because `` lutherans '' were the worst anti-semities , despite norway being practically de-christianized and secular ( nominal membership of the national church notwithstanding ) . 
  - or how we `` worked with the nazis '' , despite being violently occupied ... our government and king escaping to london . 
  - or how we are all `` quislings '' , despite he being a traitor/puppet to his * own * people - not anyone else . 
  our stance for/against israel should not invoke quisling or hitler . 
  - claims that we , the whole nation , boycotted israel . 
  when in reality one rather * radical * student group at a university suggested an academic boycott . 
  the suggestion failed to win support . 
  students ! = government of norway . 
  - how about our eurabian serf status ? 
  `` overcome '' with muslims we are obviously enemies ... 
  hilarious , we 're either aryan nazis or muslims-lovers . 
  yes , fair points , i do agree it 's taking the role of `` diplomat '' a bit far - becoming political activists ( ! ), 
  obviously that is stepping over the line of acceptable conduct . 
  - then again iran , russia and the us are also known for their various `` diplomats '' ... 
  however even if they * did n't * literally drag her out of the vehicle , i accept that that part could be `` dramatized '' for effect , they still had no right to touch her person or detain her , once they understood her status . 
  agreed ? 
   she assaulted a police officer . 
  i think you missed the point ? 
  it makes no difference who he was , she can not be prosecuted under domestic laws [ if she is indeed a diplomat ] . 
  police or no police . 
   these diplomats initiated a course of a event ( braking local law , entering closed military zone ) that is an actuall serus crimes yes , absolutely true , but as you know they are exempt from prosecution . 
  still , they will receive `` punishment '' of a sort by their own states , but it 's not for israel or ** any ** host nation to decide . 
  the punishment will probably be either unemployment or a new job at their least important embassy . 
  * persona non grata * being the key phrase . 
  yes ? 
  after she was dragged from her vehicle - she hit a man in anger . 
  sure , that 's not perfect behavior , but i do [ logically ] understand her human reaction . 
  you know what ? 
  she 's a * diplomat * , or at least from what i 've read , that means she 's ** exempt ** from domestic law . 
  the israeli soldier could try calling the police ... she on the other hand is an official from a foreign country . 
  israeli diplomats have the same rights abroad . 
  i would n't expect this sort of behavior from a professional diplomat , but sometimes they do n't behave . 
  i expect she will be `` called back '' to her home country as punishment . 
  israel on the other hand will get a well-deserved , talking to about mistreating foreign diplomats . 
  it really is a serious breach of international agreements . 
  yes , i 'm referring to norway . 
  sweden has a similar system . 
  for example my local court performs weddings monday-friday between 0900-1500h , with other office hours on saturdays . 
  you simply have to call to book an appointment . 
  you have to present some official paperwork to verify your identities . 
  - [ this a typical room used for such civil marriages ] ( http://www.domstol.no/upload/obyf/internett/bilder/vigselsbilder/vigselsrom3_2011.jpg ) i googled civil marriages in sweden and the city of stockholm lets you book online here : - [ city of stockholm booking ] ( http://www.parvis.stockholm.se/bokning/bokning.aspx ) - [ this page in swedish explains the swedish system of religious/civil marriages ] ( http://www.aktenskap.nu/?p=3016 ), 
   how far is russia from norwegian population centers ? 
  it 's about thirty minutes by tank from the nearest city or towns . 
  about 5 minutes by fighter jet and bomber . 
  the russians have about 20 million soldiers , 1000 fighter jets and even more tanks . 
  they could take our whole region in a week or two , even with help from nato . 
   norway is more than 85 % ethnic norwegian , so `` ethnically homogeneous '' is not an unfair descriptor i 'd dispute that , especially since your idea of `` fairness '' is lacking in most regards . 
  those 15 % do n't stay in ghettos or live apart from us either . 
  `` multi-cultural '' is not determined by a certain set percentage !, 
   the un has a well-known anti-israeli bias . 
  not exactly the best argument here . 
  you seriously misunderstood that comment . 
  the record * of norway 's actions * at un forums is clearly unbiased , with protests to both friends and foes . 
  israel is not singled out , by europe , despite your use of a monocle .
