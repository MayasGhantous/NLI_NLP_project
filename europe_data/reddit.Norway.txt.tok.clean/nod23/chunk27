   nothing they do pleases you because the only thing you want from israel is capitulation . 
  which is the standard reply from hardcore apologists like you . 
  israel has no intention of following any settlement and i fully understand why . 
  this is the endgame before we reach the point where the world finally makes them settle this mess . 
  what they gain up to that date is final . 
  their promises are worth nothing until * they * want it to mean something . 
   why it is upsetting when you act so obviously unfairly conjecture , hyperbole and lies . 
  your `` information '' is bad . 
  i doubt you know the politics of even one european country let alone 50 . 
  claims of unfair treatment is not an argument when a country fails to honor promises and agreements . 
   medicins sans fronti\u00e8res haha , good one !, 
  that is ** not ** a `` european '' organization or political institution . 
  which european gov ' t or eu department do you claim it 's part of ? 
  that 's all you could find ? 
  what a joke !, 
   israel and morocco should be the ones teaching the europeans ( uk excluded ) how to do counterterrorism effectively . 
  really ? 
  this `` example '' is the complete * opposite * of the lack of cooperation you initially claimed ? 
  now , it 's a matter of attitude ? 
  sorry , did you take part in any of those meetings ? 
  i think not , loudmouth . 
  why would we need their help anyway ? 
  you hardly know our security systems either . 
  we 're not the one 's that have problems with terrorists . 
  have you noticed any terrorist attacks in europe by arabs lately ? 
  maybe the iranian-financed attack on israelis in bulgaria ? 
  the only problem being that bulgaria is about as european [ in this regard ] as chopsticks . 
  western and eastern europe is two different worlds . 
   because you 're a completely homogeneous country with no real enemies and money yeah , no , but whatever you say . 
  you 've obviously never been to norway . 
  does russia not count as a threat ? 
   who level criticisms against israel without corresponding criticisms against israel 's arab neighbors . 
  patently false . 
  check un records for example , we talk with everyone including hamas . 
  * we * do n't pick sides , that 's why . 
   when israel makes a concession to the palestinians , europe is unimpressed ; lots of promises , little actual movement . 
  see any two-state solution recently ? 
   europe clapped and cheered for syria 's `` reformist '' new president . 
  yeah , no , europe is not a country either . 
  we vote 50 different ways . 
  anyway , israel and the us likes to point out that `` we '' are unfair . 
  a lot . 
  life is unfair . 
   not `` european '' enough to be accepted cordially in european organizations . 
  what ? 
  israel takes part in most things european that is important ; trade agreements with the eu , education cooperation and freedom of travel . 
  any areas in particular you know of where they do n't ? 
  heck they 've won the eurovision song contest a few times . 
  they play in the european sports leagues . 
  just a missile at night then ? 
  hehe , amusing . 
  especially considering norway is frequently `` vilified '' in israeli media . 
  i wonder if my jewish roots will help me avoid the death penalty ? 
   the problem is the diabolic plan that seems to be working yes , and if it works for israel , why would they abandon it ? 
  sure , but they have a different perspective from t.a. 
  and jerusalem . 
  i 've visited and have some sympathy even . 
  it 's just that their view of the world is very different from that of the average european or american . 
  they 're at war , their `` survival '' is at stake , according to them . 
  the point being that this will have consequences . 
  the answer to my question will determine what happens . 
  the eu has [ already shown some willingness to act ] ( http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-07-16/world/40603756_1_settlements-east-jerusalem-golan-heights ) against israel recently . 
   if israel cared , they would n't bulldoze peoples home and kick them out for settlements . 
  israel is n't careless , quite the opposite , they 're * caculating * ; where and what to grab , how much they can get away with . 
  - this is the endgame , before the final borders will be written in political stone . 
  oh , well , the soldiers probably did their jobs . 
  the question is did they know what they were doing ? 
  was this is an * intentional * diplomatic incident ? 
  i do n't have to read the report to understand that it 's not `` europe '' as a whole - but rather certain countries in particular . 
  hehe , you are right of course !, 
  hmm , iceland should be on this map ? 
  it was after all empty when we settled it . 
  a `` right-wing '' government is hardly true either , it 's not formed yet . 
  if it does come together it will be a ** centre-right ** government of potentially four parties !, 
  in other news : * politicians * weep after * losing * an election . 
   and for the rest of the countries ... 
  i 'm talking about civil marriage that is the valid one by law . 
  uh , no , that 's not true for my jurisdiction . 
  we do n't have a separation of church and state here , so marriages are done by either a priest * or * at city hall . 
  if you 're married in a church in norway , the marriage would also be legal and valid in spain . 
  obviously , otherwise norwegians would n't be recognized as `` married '' abroad . 
  anyway , i think you misunderstood . 
  i was wondering if it was a matter of booking a civil or a church wedding . 
  getting a church for a marriage ceremony can sometimes be problematic where i live - because of demand . 
  going to the city hall is a simple matter , free and done very quickly . 
  waiting ? 
  you have to wait to get married ? 
  church or city offices ? 
  yeah , but he would have to live in belarus , and it would n't get him mep immunity . 
  i only stated what their foundations were . 
  i went into their politics in another post . 
  they 're clearly not about reducing spending , but to dismiss their politics is both unfair and undemocratic . 
  they are conservative and liberal ( economically ) . 
  they certainly advocate more freedoms and less state intervention - but not a smaller state . 
  they are a far cry from the finn 's party and the sweden-democrats . 
  the progress party has developed over the last thirty years , they were founded as the ** anti-tax ** and small government party ( ! ), 
  in norway the conservatives are financially responsible and * socially * liberal . 
  there are openly gay , prominent members of the party etc. 
  the progress party desires greater investment in infrastructure , at least in policy terms , however they have never been in government . 
  their financial policy would be slightly at odds with the conservatives .
