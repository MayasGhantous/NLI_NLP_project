  they will probably balance and temper each other . 
  do you watch a lot of american tv ? 
   in the united states , liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the `` new deal '' , whereas in europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and * laissez-faire * economic policies . 
  - the americans use liberal to mean something quite different . 
  in american terms the frp is `` libertarian '' . 
  - the ** original ** meaning of liberal ( as in classic liberalism ) is still valid in europe and other parts of the world . 
  technically `` venstre '' is liberal/libertarian , the progress party ( frp ) is liberal-conservative . 
  riiight , raping and plundering who ? 
  [ the only colony there died centuries ago ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/archaeologists-uncover-clues-to-why-vikings-abandoned-greenland-a-876626.html ) . 
  i suppose we might call the few modern danish people there `` colonizers '' . 
  doctors are terrible , i know . 
  still , they have home rule and full sovereignty if they wish . 
  if you said the present day us virgin islands i might agree . 
  hehe , yes , there is that stereotype . 
  mass media and modern communication has changed our dialect continuum . 
  i would say what you described is typical of an older generation of coastal fishermen . 
  it 's a far stretch from the oslo dialect which many encounter and describe as `` happy '' . 
  [ this old fisherman from the west coast ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62xgnx0oy-q ) was even featured on a comedy/talk show because his dialect was so hard to understand , 
  i read a report by hrw , or some similar organization , but the numbers escape me at the moment . 
  the report was n't limited to the uae or the gulf of course . 
  i located these reports which proved fascinating : [ ending the exploitation of migrant workers in the gulf ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uaql6zkjhvgj:dl.tufts.edu/file_assets/tufts:up149.001.00071.00008+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=no ) - `` in the 2009 report on forced labor , the ilo estimates that migrant workers are defrauded of more than $ 20 billion a year in terms of opportunity cost or lost earnings due to forced work . '', 
  the international trade union confederation confronts fifa about qatar construction conditions in [ `` behind the gleaming cities of doha ( qatar ) and dubai ( uae ) ''  ( http://www.ituc-csi.org/new-report-on-misery-of-gulf?lang=en ) - `` the uae 's wages protection system phased in since 2009 obliges companies to pay workers through electronic bank payments which can be monitored by the authorities . 
  the move has been widely praised , but it has not stopped late payment of wages being the biggest complaint in the migrant hostels '', 
  since you asked both swedes and danes claim norwegians sound like we 're always extremely cheerful and happy , hehe . 
  what ? 
  haha  no , i would n't say that 's a fair description !, 
  finland is a great neighbor !, 
  they are not entirely like us other scandinavians in terms of language or ethnic groups . 
  however what i meant was their culture differs from ours in some minor ways . 
  my stereotype finn is darker and more somber than a swede . 
   the pillaging occurred 1000 years ago he 's probably accusing us of imperialism/colonialism , we only pillaged * other europeans * . 
  i guess you/we did have st. croix . 
  still , they turned out alright . 
  yeah , * scandinavia * really colonized and raped the world . 
  no , wait that was the uk , france , spain , portugal etc. 
  you know , those larger nations further down the list ? 
   ~ ~ iceland ~ ~ , last year 's winner , is n't in the eu and does n't use the euro denmark [ 2012 index ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/06/world-happiness-report-2012_n_1408787.html ), 
  finnish culture is not typically scandinavian . 
  there 's a reason it 's a * nordic * country . 
  how did you get out ?!, 
  come baaaaack !, 
   many of those workers actually want to be there ? 
  you probably already know they 're often cheated , beaten and can work months without payment ... 
  if they get paid , it 's rarely as agreed upon . 
  i think [ al-jazeera showed the reality very well ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckwfefrmbr0 ) . 
  how else do you spell slaves ? 
  sk\u00e5l , dear neighbors !, 
  best of luck !, 
   my teacher is trying to teach me bokmal strictly speaking there is no `` bokm\u00e5l '' or `` nynorsk '' , those are only written standards . 
  in norwegian adult learning centers foreigners are usually taught something called `` standard eastern norwegian '' ( \u00d8stlandsk ) . 
  it 's not a real language , but a construct that conforms roughly to what is spoken in the greater region centered * around * and outside oslo . 
   in fact they all seem to speak differently even within the same family yes , that is fairly typical of any region . 
  we are very liberal when it comes to alternative forms . 
  never mind when emphasis is applied or pitch accent and tonality ; `` one '' includes * ein * , * \u00e9n * , * ehhn * . 
   never been to oslo but i have heard people from the area speak and it sounds way different i live on the west coast myself and it 's a proud region . 
  the eastern/oslo region is home to the majority of the population and the dialect has been fairly normative . 
  see the above statement about standard eastern norwegian . 
  it 's normal in most countries that the dialect of the capital becomes both dominant and despised in the `` periphery '' . 
  with all due respect to my own region , we all see ourselves as the most important . 
  in norway we value dialects , so even in public media people use * their * dialects . 
  a few other regions of the country also speak something similar to eastern , but to be fair there is nothing `` typically '' norwegian as every region speaks its own version , and we 're fiercely proud of it !, 
  it 's everyone else that sounds weird , hehe !, 
  - bergen stands out for its dialect and history . 
  it was once our capital and they rightly feel unique . 
  sometimes we joke that bergen is not norway . 
  while you 're not wrong in thinking oslo dialect sounds `` swedish '' , it is closer to sweden geographically . 
  it is sometimes called dano-norwegian , as in danish spoken by norwegians . 
  we were more influenced by our danish masters over 400 years than our short-lived union with sweden . 
  in short , if you 're * not * able to decipher eastern/oslo dialect you will have problems understanding a lot of norwegian television , movies , music , books and people . 
  hehe , yeah , learning norwegian is technically not difficult for english/german speakers ... but the actual , * real life * pronunciation is very hard . 
  due to some family members , that are teacher ( s ) , i 've grown up with students [ of norwegian ] from all over the world and of all ages . 
  it 's my personal opinion that it 's almost impossible for 1st generation immigrants to become fully fluent , but that should n't scare you as it 's not that important . 
  children often become fluent within months . 
  in many areas of the country , if you 're not norwegian , we 'll spot you a mile away , hehe . 
  we will adjust to help you !, 
  i think it 's also best to be brutally honest about the many dialects and sociolects you will no doubt encounter several times a day . 
  some are harder than others and we will expect you to decipher those . 
  it 's not entirely unproblematic for some norwegians either , hehe !, 
  oh , and there are many swedish workers in oslo , so be prepared to be greeted in either swedish , upper class oslo'ese , archaic pensioner 's tongue , northern norwegian , pakistani-norwegian , eastern oslo working class slang or even west coast dialects . 
  no pressure !, 
  yes , but they usually built them in their * own * countries , right ? 
  also , it was far from the only way our churches were built , in many cases the church * itself * was the rich guy ... collecting taxes , owning land and selling pardons . 
  deal !, 
  hmm , i wonder how hard it is to remove the blue stripe from our flag ? 
  very fitting for this week 's news !, 
  yeah , i hope it works out soon as well , but maybe it 's like your name suggests ; it takes a little hell to end up with hellas . 
  in norwegian `` hell '' means luck , maybe there 's more to it ? 
  okay , okay , how much oil is it going to take to keep it quiet ? 
  ah , did n't get that , sorry . 
  i can see it now . 
  truth be told , i consider denmark our `` mommy '' in that sense . 
  sweden 's more like our bigger brother . 
  yeah , i can only imagine . 
  it would be like never having access to the disney movies , only the comics are far better of course . 
  i love your nick , did n't notice it until now . 
  hell-as , indeed . 
  well , no , in this case it was the government , as in the `` nanny '' state , you know ? 
  yes , but do n't let mommy hear you saying that !, 
   ban licorice pipes aha !, 
  that explains the danish boss i read about handing out licorice pipes to his workers ...
