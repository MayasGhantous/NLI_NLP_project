  ** shh !!!, 
  *** , do n't tell them anything they can use against us ... 
  it will be like when we banned `` life of brian '' . 
  the swedes used it in their ads ; `` so good it was banned in norway ! '', 
  [ `` have you tried killing the poor ? 
  '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owi7doeo_yg ), 
  funny , the same thing applies here in norway . 
  the donald duck & co comics have aquired a very loyal readership over the decades . 
  it is such an attractive group of readers ( demographically ) that it/engineering companies ran ads in the comic to recruit engineers . 
  my brother and i are both in it and we grew up devoted to disney comics . 
  now , my brother 's son is a young devotee . 
  this is n't the end , this is the beginning !, 
  this is part of [ the suggested plan for a shared pan-european network ] ( http://www.dw.de/europe-telecoms-weigh-tie-up-in-network-drive/a-16507576 ) which will probably reduce prices without such `` articifical '' limits . 
  i 'm guessing the dropped measure did n't make it into the new package kroes is going to present on september 10 . 
  to quote the article : - '' * her spokesman ryan heath said : we 've made several technical improvements over the summer that will help us reach our ongoing objective of a real telecoms single market . 
  i have feeling this has to do with * perception * rather than fact . 
  as humans we tend to find patterns where there are none etc. 
  so i 'm not saying you 're `` wrong '' , i 'm saying it 's subjective . 
  well , i might be biased because of my high school 's russian programme and my business in portugal . 
  i still think you 're `` crazy '' for thinking it sounds russian !, 
  hehe , yeah , i guess it 's often a mix . 
  have you heard west coast dialects from norway ? 
  also , i 've watched a little of your tv and it is n't that hard to understand , then again i also had icelandic friends in school . 
  i strongly disagree . 
  i have colleagues in portugal , and i learned russian in school . 
  to me that comparison is very , very strange . 
   as for a scandinavian language sounding chinese ... well i honestly find that very hard to believe as they do n't have remotely similar sounds . 
  exactly . 
  it 's just the only really foreign language they knew the name of . 
  the first thing that popped into their heads i guess . 
  the bbc 's pages say [ swedish and norwegian are tonal ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/languages/norwegian.shtml ) . 
  i think norwegian and swedish have the same issue , as you pointed out , it 's both tonal and has pitch accents . 
  it just does n't apply to all forms and dialects of norwegian for example . 
  it sounds a lot like west coast norwegian . 
  i 'm on the phone with people in the faroes now and then , it 's really quite easy to understand . 
  a final solution for the obesity problem ? 
   eu is still a net force for good , even after subtracting the negatives . 
  in the end that 's what matters , but i think many people around europe do n't see that . 
  so while you 're probably correct about the nationalists , i was actually thinking about more average attitudes towards the whole european project . 
  they were bad to begin with , and probably worse now . 
  my impression from reading/watching the news , from protests in spain to greece , has been that the eu in many cases was featured on the banners ( in a negative context ) . 
  at least cyprus and its people seem to understand that the blame lies with the * national * government . 
  so , yeah , i think a little glass of that would work wonders for many angry citizens of the eu . 
  it seems so counterproductive . 
  - take angela merkel and greece , she did n't destroy the greek economy . 
  german/eu money should be welcomed . 
  i just think it 's misguided , that people from spain to greece are blaming * the eu * for this crisis . 
  the eu * could * be the solution as well . 
  ** norway ** - election time !, 
  guess what ? 
  finger-pointing and `` doomsday '' scenarios . 
  - the citizens of oslo do n't want to apply for the olympic games in 2022 . 
  it 's too expensive . 
  - one of our citizens imprisoned in congo , for murder , died in his cell . 
  the parents are despairing over the `` failure '' of our government to get them released ... lots of noise over nothing ( impossible ) . 
  oh , i just said it was a serious stereotype , there was no implied judgement or comment on your use of it . 
  just pointing out the funny hat , not the man wearing it . 
   we do n't really blame the eu or the imf . 
  that 's so rational and logical . 
  can we bottle it and export it to other southern european countries , do you think ? 
  haha , yeah , but do * you * own a house or apartment ? 
  what 's with the english speaking and sweeeeeden ? 
  sweden 's not that hard to spell . 
   and of course it 's uk and not gb , they 're different things . 
  haha , yes , i 'm very , very much aware of that . 
  i love geography and history , and i have seen the video before . 
  no , the fact is that you 're a little confused by my use of gb . 
  it 's perfectly understandable that you would assume it was a mistake on my part . 
  it is however * the iso standard * that lists the uk as `` gb '' . 
  the european commission generally uses [ iso 3166-1 alpha-2 codes ] ( http://www.obs.coe.int/about/iso_3166.html ) with the two exceptions . 
  probably after mild `` suggestions '' from london , they replaced it with the more proper `` uk '' . 
   why is germany still abbreviated as de ? 
  i believe the standard in question , without checking properly , has a lot of french influence . 
  the major powers probably got what they wanted . 
  - so while germany did get their native * deutschland * , - austria is * autriche * ( at ) instead of * \u00d6sterreich * . 
  - it even has switzerland as `` confoederatio helvetica '' ( ch ) and not * schweiz * | * suisse * | * svizzera * . 
  so you see hungary is just one of those countries that did n't get its proper name . 
  maybe they did n't have enough pull ? 
  who says they 're * ever * going to reclaim 2007 levels . 
  does greece have the foundations for such growth within normal economic conditions ( without borrowing ) ? 
  i do n't know if there is any reason for greece to be so much richer than its neighbors ? 
  yes , they have an educated population , but it 's leaving . 
  do they have some unique circumstance or resources ? 
  all i know they have that is unique is shipping and tourism . 
  the deconstruction of communist russia was terribly managed , they should have found a way to do it gradually or softer . 
  the leaders at the time even said they wanted something like scandinavian socialism . 
  belarus opted for something less inhumane , but they 're stuck in `` limbo '' now . 
   it 's common , but your country is so expensive that it 's hard to believe it . 
  it 's actually only expensive if you 're not paid in the local currency at ordinary levels . 
  purchasing power parity does that for most people . 
   nobody can live in acceptable conditions being jobless a long time in spain . 
  however , it 's posible here . 
  at least for now , as you said , i would n't bet on it in the near future . 
  oh , yes , i know you meant in spain . 
  however with regards to the salaries i thought you would have heard about it in sweden  p.s. 
  i 'm not downvoting you , but somebody really does n't like you . 
  i 'm not saying it has been handled in * that * sense . 
  i just meant the debt was unbearable , greece does n't have the capacity to finance it or the lifestyle . 
  so at some point there would have to be cuts , which would create the same problems they currently have with unemployment , poverty and protests . 
  oh , we 're much like you were , there 's a huge demand for workers in norway which has lead to large salaries for all .
