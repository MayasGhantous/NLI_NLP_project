  yes , but not `` always and every industry '' . 
  never say never , 
  the anti-piracy mission [ `` operation atalanta '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_atalanta ) seems to work well enough . 
  on the other hand norway is part of the eu 's [ nordic battle group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_battle_group ) also . 
  the news here talks about how finland and sweden are increasingly cooperating ? 
  you 're both cooperating with nato , why do n't you just join now ? 
  obviously , georgia was an example of russia 's willingness to use force . 
  the crimea another . 
  the pressure on the baltic states further examples . 
  the central and eastern european countries ( visegrad ) have made repeated requests for more training and deployment to ensure their safety . 
   the dutch have apaches . 
  the uk has and builds them as well . 
   it is n't so much of a leap to say that point still stands today for both european and russian big business . 
  even more so now that europeans often own businesses or interest in russia , while russians have a great amount of money placed/invested in europe . 
   would they be unwilling to negotiate a compromise as was the way of settling conflicts oh , they all know it 's going to end around a table eventually ; it 's just a matter of gaining the upper hand before that meeting is called . 
  will it be russia or the west that folds first ? 
  will eastern ukraine end up in russia 's hands as a bargaining chip ? 
  with everything up in the air , is this not the perfect time for russia to settle all the other outstanding matters ? 
  including helping their friends and strategic allies take advantage . 
  i bet azerbaijan takes action against armenia over [ nagorno-karabakh ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18270325 ) . 
  georgia experienced russian action in 2008 , but that could happen again etc. 
  yeah , it does !, 
  i 've also heard great things about the rubber tracks . 
   although we 're all part of nato , ... it means logistics , communications , supplies etc will be distributed and used not as efficiently as a central command  i mean we 'd all be fighting under nato command , presumably , but that does n't stop the fact that there would be british , norwegian , dutch etc armies individually . 
  i respectfully disagree . 
  that is exactly why we have nato training and integration exercises . 
  we have all standardized along nato lines for command , communication and weaponry . 
  i believe we have a good experiences from many theatres of war including : - libya - afghanistan - european nato exercises [ including `` cold response '' ] ( http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/sixteen-nations-participating-in-norway-s-cold-response-military-exercise-this-week ) . 
  this [ bbc video report ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-26627368 ) is also relevant . 
  the eu 's battlegroups are another extension of this cooperation . 
  [ the nordic battle group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_battle_group ) for example shows how even the * non-nato * countries like sweden and finland work well within nato 's command structure . 
  the russian armaments manufacturers are state-owned . 
  i wonder if that does n't give the russians an edge in terms of roi/purchasing . 
  bae is supposed to make profit for its many shareholders . 
  does [ the russian aircraft corporation mig ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikoyan ) sell their units at better prices ? 
  yeah , but a good deal of the relevant countries are in the `` others '' category . 
  also , it 's not how much you have , it 's what you use it for , hehe . 
  haha , if only !, 
  thanks , that 's very interesting . 
  on second thought it wo n't tell us much about the abilities and results . 
  what do we know about the costs and investments made ? 
  does russia get more or better fighter jets , tanks or soldiers for their rubels ? 
  they pretty much own their [ domestic ] armaments manufacturers . 
  or are nato soldiers generally better motivated , trained and equipped ? 
  i hesitate to claim that they are , but i believe they might be . 
  the russians have invested a lot more lately , but they have to catch up after decades of decay . 
  hehe , yes , now that you mention it !, 
  i guess that 's why norway is buying more and upgrading our existing swedish-made cv90s instead . 
  the leo 's we have are great , but the cv90s are better suited for our new reality . 
  it 's quite different from where i sit . 
  this is a * community * banding together . 
  ukraine is outside of the formal community ( eu/nato ) , but none the less a european state . 
  the action i described ( jef ) is in response to a formal request , and in defense of our european brothers in nato . 
  to deploy forces in ukraine would not be in the best interest of anyone at this point ; it could escalate and provoke . 
  arming afghanistan was not a `` we '' from what i understand ? 
  i was n't here at the time , but i believe it was the us that armed their allies . 
  now , we are sending our own troops to help reinforce our outer defenses as a deterrent in the face an unpredictable , foreign agressor . 
  this is no ideological war , but a very real geo-political conflict . 
  they 're tallest on average [ in the world ] , but we 're not that far behind , 
  the combined spending on defense ( % ) would be interesting as well . 
  my country 's sending mech inf to latvia as part of regular training and deployment . 
  the existing nato allies in eastern europe have requested more training and deployment . 
  ukraine is not a member yet . 
   he moved back to his farm liatorp outside \u00c4lmhult this summer oh , how interesting , i did n't know that . 
  i guess he 's wrapping things up now that his family has taken over control . 
   im aware that the a foundation called interogo is located in liechtenstein . 
  here 's [ the dutch ~ ~ company ~ ~ foundation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stichting_ingka_foundation ) i was referring to . 
  it says he , l mittal , is an indian citizen on wikipedia , resident in the uk . 
  is he a citizen though ? 
  he does n't even live in sweden though , and his money/company is dutch etc. 
  it 's hardly fraud to set up a fund . 
  you do have a lot more manpower available as well in absolute terms ( see population size ) . 
  the `` leftist '' / whatever , are known for making violent threats , stabbings , and attacking members of far-right groups in their homes . 
  these people are not playing around , you do n't want them to meet face to face . 
  - overdriven -  worked to exhaustion - driven over -  literally driven over by a vehicle ( overk\u00f6rd ), 
  these horses are specifically trained for this scenario . 
  they only pick horses that manage to stay calm and take orders during battle . 
  they expose the horses to police recruits role-playing ; brawling and making lots of noise . 
  they even train them to tolerate gunshots and firing of tear gas canisters etc. 
  the oil & gas belongs to the state . 
  i have actually done my homework on the matter . 
  okay , i just wanted to hear that , i realize you might have looked at it thoroughly . 
  however , the conclusions you 've reached are of course slightly pessimistic . 
  the newspaper articles you linked to are after all not saying it 's predetermined . 
  also , there is a difference between a country that 's on its knees ( greece ) and being hounded/punished by the markets , and a country that could potentially experience problems ( sweden ) . 
  what i 'm getting at is that `` trust '' is a valuable commodity for any lender/nation . 
  sweden would still be afforded more credit than greece , possibly just because of its good name than anything else . 
   however , norway  sweden . 
  is n't this what you want to hear ? 
  :d haha , yeah , but only in the sense that we realize that we live in exceptional times of good fortune  at least we 're taking good care of our wealth . 
  we 're in different leagues in terms of industry and population . 
  interesting , i did n't even know denmark or sweden had this type of borrowers . 
  it 's unheard of in norway , but we had our housing market crash a few decades ago now . 
  we tightened the rules some time ago . 
  the oecd does n't like everything about our market and its high prices , but we have cash and the market works well . 
  it does look a bit like you 're trying very hard to find `` faults '' with northern europe , like you 're trying to say southern europe was n't exceptional just unlucky ? 
  your attitude seems a bit weird to me , i 'm not sure what you think , are you under the impression that this is normal in all of northern europe ? 
  very few people . 
  the banks do have a new product for the elderly , basically it lets them eat their cake and have it too ( own the house , increasing their debt every month ) . 
  that 's the number of citizens , right ?
