  do n't you live in sweden ? 
  i thought you would know , hehe . 
  lots of swedish kids come to work here and stay for the money , but we 're also attracting more professionals . 
   i do n't know about norway , but here the police pays better than many jobs that require college degrees police in norway have to qualify/apply to a three year police college , if they complete their education then they can apply for a job opening , hehe . 
  teachers are also very well paid in norway . 
  yes , in all eu documents , it 's the recommended standard . 
  - el for greece - uk and not gb, 
  til : bip -  * bruttoinlandsprodukt * -  gdp - german term : bruttoinlandsprodukt - norwegian term : bruttonasjonalprodukt, 
  could the greek debt problem have been handled * without * painful cuts and consequences ? 
   an unskilled construction worker earned more than a software engineer in spain seven years ago . 
  that 's an anomaly , as you know . 
  it 's not even worth mentioning in my opinion . 
  yes , all good points , however there might be positive turn of events on the horizon as well . 
  i 'm sure new opportunities await in belarus and ukraine , and especially for poland !, 
  that would solve the demographic problem for you as well as helping those countries . 
  it 's not a permanent solution to the demographic challenges around europe . 
  that problem can be fixed postfactum when the playing field has been leveled , so much that workers will want to move freely between the countries , like they do in the states of the us . 
   we in the south know how to enjoy life even if our kids have nothing to eat or wear . 
  that 's some stereotype you 're peddling there !, 
  ah , i see , very modern ... a little form over function . 
  yes , but are n't you forgetting that it 's only `` classified '' according to us laws ... which do n't actually apply in the uk or anywhere outside of the us . 
   one can wonder if they intend for us to get confused ... well , one is a democratic forum * without * much power , the other is a '' * non-democratic * '' forum with lots of power . 
  interesting juxtaposition !, 
  however it is a requirement for eu membership that you ratify the convention and accept the court . 
  the eu is now itself a subject of the echr . 
  in a way you 're right though , because all eu member states must sign up for the echr . 
  it 's built-in to the eu treaties , it 's a condition for membership . 
  just look at turkey ( ! ), 
  the council of europe existed before the eu , so we were `` all '' members anyway . 
  no , * you * are wrong : ** european union : ** - european union 's council ( 1993 ) -  [ consilium.europa.eu ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu ) - all eu member states must ratify the european convention on human rights ( from the council of europe ) and become subjects of the court ** council of europe organization : ** - council of europe ( 1949 ) -  [ coe.int ] ( http://hub.coe.int/ ) - european court of human rights -  [ www.echr.coe.int ] ( http://www.echr.coe.int ), 
  it 's worth noting that the rijksmuseum only just reopened and [ they made sure we 'd notice ( youtube ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6w2zmpsxhg ) . 
  ever since visiting portugal for the first time , and later working with people from portugal , i 've come to the conclusion that you 're just * nice people * in general !, 
  yes , of course , just pointing out the difference between the two . 
   you ca n't outsource your entire prison system to a foreign country . 
  that would be a misrepresentation of what we and others do . 
  the uk and austria are challenged by the number of romanians committing crimes in their countries ; sending them back to serve their time in romania is not only appropriate , better for the convict , but saves them a lot of money . 
  after all if the convict is banned from returning to the country what purpose could `` rehabilitating '' him have ? 
  in fact austria wanted to actually build [ its own prisons in romania ] ( http://www.news.at/articles/0420/10/81383/es-sache-oesterreich-gefaengnis-rumaenien ) ... ** sweden & transfer law ** i did a little digging and it turns out there 's council of europe ( non-eu ) additional protocol regarding forced transfer of prisoners . 
  `` an additional protocol to the council of europe convention was introduced in 1997 . 
  this additional protocol brings in two conditions where prisoners can be transferred * without their consent * and , as such , presents a radical departure from the spirit of the council of europe convention . '', 
  [ sweden has indeed ratified ] ( http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/commun/cherchesig.asp?nt=167&amp;cm=8&amp;df=17/08/2013&amp;cl=eng ) this protocol [ ( ets 167 ) ] ( http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/reports/html/167.htm ) . 
  yes , as i said , i 'm not bothering to look very hard . 
  it 's probably better if i knew the swedish keywords/alternatives for agreement , transfer , prisons etc. 
  it 's probably hidden away on some justice dept. 
  website or similar . 
  that is if it exists at all . 
  i ca n't be bothered to search very hard , i did find one swedish source but it seems terribly racist . 
  i understand perfectly well , i 'm saying your gov ' t probably does the same . 
  why do n't you look at swedish websites instead then ? 
  i hardly think norway 's unique in doing this . 
  * you * probably have the exact same problems with both iraqis and romanians , do n't you agree ? 
  also , did you read where i said ** we cooperate ** on those flights to iraq and other places ? 
  here , read [ this source supports that claim ] ( http://www.tv2.no/nyheter/utenriks/irakere-tvangsutsendt-fra-norge-i-natt-3225505.html ) , '' ... this flight was organized by the eu , sending iraqis from norway , sweden etc. . . '', 
   if what you said were true we would n't bother with any of that , i 'd think . 
  no , you 're simply confusing two different groups of people and why it 's being done . 
  - iraqis get sent back because they 're no longer welcome . 
  - romanians , for example , get sent back to reduce crime . 
  yes , we sometimes even cooperate within the nordic countries on those flights * outside of europe * to keep costs down . 
  however those are flights for non-europeans who do n't have residency permits and have finished serving their time . 
  ** negotiations between norway and romania : ** if what i 'm saying is true ? 
  oh , sorry , i forgot to give you [ a source ( in norwegian ) ] ( http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.7300207 ) . 
  to quote the article : - `` the agreement [ between norway and romania ] will make it easier to send the convicts to prison in romania '' . 
  norway returns prisoners to their [ european ] countries of origin to serve their sentences there ( `` soningsoverf\u00f8ring '' ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure sweden does too ? 
  those prisoners , [ for example romanians ( read more ) ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nrk.no%2fnyheter%2fnorge%2f1.7300207 ) , would be `` innocent '' in their own jurisdiction of the crime they committed in norway . 
  i can assure you that romanian prisons are a far cry from norwegian standards , hehe . 
  at least they are closer to their families , speak the language and like the food . 
   breaking their windows when they 're on holidays , filling their mailbox with human faeces , waiting for them when they get back from a bar late at night and beating them with a huge dildo . 
  i * really * do n't want to be your neighbor !, 
  that does explain it , or at least it 's a possible contributing factor . 
  yes , i get that , but in the tourist areas ? 
  seems oddly illogical , though i know there are lots of private english schools . 
  the un certainly [ does ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe#un ) . 
  while true there are many [ definitions of eastern europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe#un ) and none are definite . 
  - the un calls greece part of `` southern europe '' . 
  [ the americans have been exporting ] ( http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/why-china-isnt-taking-american-trash-anymore/19420 ) paper , plastic and other `` trash '' resources to china for handling and recycling for a while now . 
  but it has also suddenly stopped due to commodity price changes , cost of handling and outright chinese [ environmental ] ** bans ** on trash imports ... 
  so now they 're stuck with large amounts of trash that are piling up without any market or handlers . 
  i wonder why it is such a marked difference between my experiences in spain and portugal ? 
  i 've been visiting spain for over two decades now ; i still meet people who do n't speak english in tourist areas all over your wonderful country ( from the canaries to barcelona ) ... my few visits to portugal have been the opposite ; even the old men spoke it quite well . 
  my business connections in portugal are less fluent than the taxi drivers at the airport , hehe . 
  it 's usually the opposite !, 
  i 'm quite impressed by the average * portuguese * person 's english skills . 
  even the 50 year old taxi drivers in lisboa spoke it well !, 
  i ca n't say i feel it represents the reality in norway very well . 
  as a whole the numbers may be correct , but there 's quite a lot of difference . 
  in some municipalities/cities of norway you do a lot more than in other cities/municipalities . 
  - the place ( s ) i live now , you have to separate all of your trash ; organics , paper , metal , plastics , and other ( '' * restavfall * '' ) . 
  - while in other [ norwegian ] communities you have no real sorting at all . 
  the whole debacle about sweden importing our garbage , norway * and * sweden both competing to buy italian trash , ought to make it clear why our efforts may not be entirely correctly measured or used . 
  i 've worked with the largest recycling businesses in norway ; from metal to electronics trash . 
  it 's quite extensive and the legal framework applies nationwide . 
  - the mandatory fees and handling that businesses are subject to is actually rather impressive - see the '' * milj\u00f8avgift * '' tax for electronics - the way retailers are required to accept old equipment and dispose of it the deposit on bottles and cans ( '' * pant * '' ) probably improves our numbers a lot . 
  nah , it 's not really important , but it 's a far cry from abolished . 
  no , you 're wrong on two accounts . 
  - it was [ `` abolished '' ] ( http://www.nrk.no/trondelag/snart-slutt-for-statskirken-i-norge-1.8137779 ) on the 14th of may ** 2012 ** . 
  - secondly , it was only a minor adjustment of the relationship between state and church . 
  the humanist association [ points out the following ] ( http://www.human.no/aktuelt/nyheter/2012/nei-det-er-ikke-slutt-pa-statskirken/ ) : - the constitution was changed to read `` the norwegian church remains the norwegian people 's church '' . 
  - the king must be a member of said church - the church will not be incorporated and the state remains * the employer * for priests and other non-lay workers - the norwegian church is still to be funded over the national budget, 
   visit someday ?
