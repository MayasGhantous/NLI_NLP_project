  what makes you think i have n't been to russia ? 
  st. petersburg is really impressive . 
  i like russia and plan on going further east . 
   how much do you know and from where did you read it ? 
  good question !, 
  i learned russian in high school here in norway . 
  so i read russian newspapers and blogs . 
  oh , wait , did i mention that my family originally came from russia ? 
  long time ago now . 
  i know some russians here . 
   implicit behaviors that no law or right will ever get right . 
  i 'm afraid the world proves otherwise . 
  how do you explain the shift in europe and the us ? 
  we * did n't * exactly love homosexuals here either ... we gradually changed our laws and attitudes followed . 
  the issue is not really gays or not , i have no particular interest in gay people 's rights myself . 
  i do n't even know any . 
  i do care ** deeply ** about my country 's laws and ideals . 
  the foundation of my society 's stability , which is quantifiable and internationally recognized , is our equality , rights and well-functioning political system . 
  citizens should be equal in all manners , which is not the case in russia !, 
  [ the bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15748696 ) has an interactive debtor/creditor map called `` who owes what to whom ? '' . 
  [ the telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/interactive-graphics/graphic-of-the-day/8868729/graphic-european-debt-crisis-explained.html ) also has an interesting graphic presentation . 
  [ the economist ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/07/european-economy-guide ) has a forecast for [ 2013 debt/gdp graph ( imgur ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pavylww ), 
  since it 's from 2010 , it 's accurate for the eu at the time . 
  i only said the gov ' t for a reason . 
  i know plenty of iranians and plan on visiting in fact . 
   for some people in western europe , they do n't mind giving away small rights such as total free speech that 's an interesting view , especially when the contrast is russia !, 
  what * free * speech exists in russia ?!, 
  no , there are limit to free speech in the us , europe and other democracies . 
  for good reasons i might add . 
   see what kind of reactions you get when you say `` i do n't like them gay parades '' it 's acceptable to me , your opinion is valid and legal . 
  you do n't * have * to watch them , but we * wo n't * stop them because you do n't like them either ... 
  your rights end where others ' begin . 
   a fallacy to think you will get equality for everyone by focusing 100 % on a single group of people . 
  what ? 
  we * do n't * focus on any one group . 
  everyone gets the same rights !, 
  gays are one group , colored people another , disabled people , religious minorities . 
  russia is the one singling out one group ...  sooner or later it will be evident that you ca n't keep everyone happy all times . 
  that 's true of all countries , but it 's easier to handle by giving them freedoms and rights . 
  fair point , i must admit , except of course in russia they 're [ not exactly protected by the police ] ( http://www.policymic.com/articles/56889/russia-is-violently-attacking-gay-people-but-watch-how-gay-bars-across-the-world-are-fighting-back ) . 
  in fact it 's now * against the law * to voice `` gay propaganda '' . 
  prison for being gay or supporting it . 
  it 's not a death sentence , but ... 
   ou discriminate on the russians because you only bully them out of many like them really ? 
  you think it 's bullying ? 
  well , now , expressing an opinion that is the opposite of yours is often claimed to be `` bullying '' by certain groups . 
  - some israelis will claim any opposition to settlements is racism ... - american christian fundamentalists claim secularists are discriminating against christians ... 
  i find your arguments quite amusing , but i ca n't say i agree at all . 
   they are just scared to express it because if they do they 'll die . 
  at least that 's not the case in russia . 
  really ? 
  i do n't think you know russia very well then ... [ they most certainly do beat up and/or kill homosexuals in russia ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/03/uk-russia-killing-gay-idukbre9520a120130603 ) !, 
   and you discriminate the arabs because you 're not giving it a chance and you 're basically writing them out no , if you read what i wrote i said * the governments * of iran and saudi arabia are obstacles . 
  theocracies , remember ? 
  until those fall it really is hopeless . 
  i did n't say the people were lost causes because of race or religion . 
  admittedly , they are less open to the ideas we 're talking about because of their religion and culture . 
  bah , the russians might not like it , but that 's sort of the point . 
  to voice their opinion , to make it known , so that russia might feel pressured . 
  it 's not going to work overnight , it will likely never work in fact , but it 's still a democratic right , and perhaps even a duty to protest what is wrong . 
  use it or lose it . 
  iran is clearly a lost cause with the current theocracy in charge . 
  saudi arabia is not much different , with their wahabi rule and religious police . 
  yes , i would classify them as lost causes for now . 
  it 's not about love * per se * , it 's about equality for all citizens . 
  if you protect everyone , no group can become the target for oppression . 
  it 's mutual assurance and solid foundations for civil society . 
  even if you 're a heterosexual white man , like me , it ensures your safety as well . 
  your religion or political thoughts are protected , and everyone else should also protect your views . 
  have you heard about the '' [ first they came for the ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_they_came ... ) '' poem ? 
  or maybe they just do n't want to waste time on hopeless cases ? 
  russia is european and could come around . 
  why waste effort ? 
  russia * might * change its stance , i 'm not betting any money on saudi arabia or iran ... 
  ah , i see , a little bit different to what i 'm used to . 
  hmm , well , they are good for areas the gov ' t ca n't manage quickly enough , too small issues or unpopular groups , or when there 's no public money left . 
  the red cross is a good example . 
  i agree that it 's better to have it organized properly , but if they want to help out i wo n't stop them . 
  it 's fairly common in scandinavia as a whole . 
  have [ a look at norway ] ( http://www.mauriziorellini.com/data/photos/56_1norvegia__isole_lofoten_054.jpg ) . 
  it 's pretty much the same in scandinavia . 
  [ here 's an example from norway ] ( http://www.mauriziorellini.com/data/photos/57_1norvegia__isole_lofoten_095.jpg ) and [ a different angle ] ( http://www.mauriziorellini.com/data/photos/56_1norvegia__isole_lofoten_054.jpg ) . 
   church-backed charities shut down for the month of august , because holidays . 
  w. t. f. 
   the cub will be going back to china eventually , as we only leased them they 're all leased , china owns them all . 
   sending money to `` bongo-bongo land '' receives a free pair of bongos . 
  incidentally , one of our former ministers once said something silly about `` bongo from congo '' , referring to omar bongo , the president of gabon 's official visit . 
  he 's our national clown , now [ president of the council of europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thorbj%c3%b8rn_jagland ) . 
  so * that 's * where we got it from ... 
  he is quoted in the news as having said it would `` revolutionize '' how they recharged evs ( see dynamo ) ? 
  her husband joined us . . 
   i 'm sure there are reasons why it 'd be a terrible idea . 
  yes , you get what you pay for , even in politics . 
  i would n't want my municipal politicans to be paid a lot of money . 
  the minister of finance should be a top level executive with a great education and plenty of experience . 
  they create more wealth than they receive apparently ? 
  the tourist gimmick is not dead and it does add to employment from hotels to journalists . 
  we looked at the cost of introducing a republic here , it turns out it 's cheaper to keep the monarchy for us . 
  the clear benefit is that a king , as head of state , never belongs to a political party . 
  `` failing '' economy , that 's a bit ** strong ** , is n't it ?
