  how about shrinking or lethargic . 
  sorry , but kazakhstan , while it is a country in central asia , [ its smaller part west of the ural river is in eastern europe ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/europe_map_kazakhstan.png/636px-europe_map_kazakhstan.png ) according to one definition . 
  it 's for the same reason armenia , georgia and azerbaijan are included in the fold . 
  the caucasus states are sometimes included in definitions of eastern europe . 
  they are located on the border of europe and asia . 
  i spent a week in berlin this month , fortunately the new rules were in effect  still i ended up buying access to telekom 's wifi network for better speeds etc. 
  oh , that sounds bad . 
  i heard something about the austrian owned company and bribes ? 
  i wondered about globul because my national telco , telenor , bought globul this year . 
  telenor is private , but majority state-owned , so it 's sort of `` mine '' . 
  i wonder how much this matters to people and employees in general . 
  i travel a lot for work and my employer covers my bill . 
  it never elicits the faintest chirp from accounting when i 've been abroad . 
  unless i rack up  $ 1,000 per month it wo n't be mentioned . 
  how is globul seen by bulgarians ? 
  ironically the financial crisis did more for inter-eu labor mobility than any political plan ... polish people were already famous for moving around ( '' * plombier polonais * '' ) , now even the spanish are flocking to london etc. 
  it works for the americans and washington , d.c. ? 
  at least they bothered to hide it a few years ago . 
  they could at least let us have representation in congress ? 
  when did sweden join the empire ? 
  i imagine because the greeks rather like their proper name . 
  especially in their own language  incidentally , i believe my own language is the only one in europe that calls [ greece by its proper name ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_greece ) ; hellas ( `` ellas '' ) . 
  if you look at the eu 's website ( s ) , you will now find that the greek language option is shown as `` el '' \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac . 
  check out the main site : http://europa.eu/ according to the eu 's guidance : the two-letter iso code should be used ( iso 3166 alpha-2 ) , * except for greece and the united kingdom * , for which [ the abbreviations el and uk are recommended ] ( http://publications.europa.eu/code/pdf/370000en.htm ) . 
   if there is a real agreement , it would be very usefull if you provided it . 
  it 's called [ the oslo accords ] ( http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oslo/negotiations/ ) . 
   to me , with all the anti israeli in france , i cant really blame them for considering that a part of our nation is their ennemy . 
  though we should be allies nonetheless , as our ennemies are also their ennemies . 
  ( as exemple , most of france arabs are both anti israel and anti france ) well , there is that . 
  still , israel tends to call * whole * countries hostile . 
  that is not fair or correct , france is n't anti-israel . 
  it 's just a minority , and mostly muslims of varying backgrounds . 
  now , why those muslims are the enemy of * france * is more interesting . 
   then why do you call them the 1948 border , when they signify the partition plan from 1947 ? 
  because israel itself came into existence in may 1948 ? 
   partition plan has been rejected by the arabs , who started the war , so its no longer valid . 
  oh , i 'm pretty sure [ the palestinians agree to the 1967 borders ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-20064374.html ) ... 
   yes , but those were temporary ceasefire lines , they were not permanent borders and were never supposed to be . 
  well , no , but i thought you said europe decided them . 
   you are a bit confused it seems . 
  the 1948 borders are the 1967 borders . 
  they are the same thing . 
  perhaps i 'm not being precise enough . 
  i mean [ the * original * 1947 un plan ] ( http://www.israpundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/israel-1948-491.gif ) , which are very different from the post-war borders . 
  israel was founded with those borders 14 may 1948 . 
  the 1967 borders do match those after the 1948-1949 war . 
  so by `` 1948 '' i meant the original israeli borders , the original partition plan with two states . 
   then if they could n't honor these treaties , why did they sign them ? 
  i did n't say that was the * actual * agreement , that was your claim  still , the leadership at the time did agree to stop . 
  it just is n't the same parties in power today , what with hamas controlling one part etc. 
   it was you who said they were in a state of war . 
  it seem plausible to me . 
  you might have misunderstood . 
  i said their * mentality * was in a war like state . 
  they feel surrounded and under attack . 
  so if you 're not their friend , without conditions , you 're an enemy . 
  though other israelis realize what they 're doing is playing * the game * [ of conquest ] . 
   the problem is that europe completely arbitrarily decided that the green line what ? 
  i 'm sure that was israel and their neighbors/enemies . 
  israel negotiated armistice lines with jordan and egypt at rhodes in 1948-49 . 
  why would * europe * have a say or decide at that point in time ? 
  anyway , the 1947 plan and 1948 borders do n't realistically work today . 
  if we agree to the 1967 borders , the israelis still do n't respect * those * . 
  in fact the settlements and wall have made it impossible for a viable palestinian state . 
  it just would n't be able to function . 
   turkey currently illegally occupies north cyprus , and we do n't see any action from europe on that . 
  i 'm fairly certain we banned all trade with n.cyprus . 
  it 's also a key issue in their eu membership application . 
  it could have been resolved , but i guess it really was n't in the interest of the us/nato during the cold war . 
  we/they did n't want to lose a strategic player like turkey . 
  double-standards , maybe . 
   we are allies and not friends . 
  in what war ? 
  there is no enemy . 
  islam is n't the enemy ( ? ), 
  you ca n't seriously suggest afghanistan was an enemy `` state '' . 
  there was no real state to fight . 
  just some extremists and a few terrorists . 
   mention a stop of palestinian terrorism by chance ? 
  yes , that is a great argument , and it has worked for the israelis for some time . 
  if we agree they should stop the palestinian terrorism , how do you stop every terrorist in your country ? 
  i do n't see the french police stopping * all * of them at home ? 
  oh , and one man 's terrorists is another 's freedom fighter . 
  well , your op looks very different from what you 've written here . 
  i see what you 're getting at , but i would n't say i completely agree . 
   today the `` jews get out of palestine !, 
  '' , sentiment is also widespread in europe . 
  that is not entirely the same issue though . 
  the racism that forced jews out does n't have much to do with the un agreements about the two states . 
  it 's fairly typical for * any * opposition to israeli actions to be labeled `` anti-semitic '' . 
  i can disagree with their actions , and breaking of international law , without being racist . 
   i dont imply that they did litterally bought europe , at least we agree on that part , but i can see how money could affect some leaders ...  but while our interest would be to support a fellow western state , that 's all , because they 're our friend ? 
  according to that logic should n't we also embrace the us ' foreign invasions ? 
  no , israel is abusing our friendship . 
  i read israeli newspapers regularly and it 's a different mentality . 
  they 're at war . 
   they took this absurde claim to please some arabs countries . 
  is n't it fair that we tell them to stop when they 're breaking every agreement made ? 
  the expansion around jerusalem is literally so obvious that it 's comical . 
  yes , but nobody 's disputing that they shouted that .
