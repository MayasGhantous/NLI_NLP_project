  you claimed it was europe 's idea . 
  having read books on herzl and the process we know they did convince some key british leaders to advocate on their behalf . 
  the british came to support the idea and in a sense told them to go there . 
  hardly europe as a whole . 
  even so the 1947 plan is not what we have now . 
  that 's all you cared to comment on ? 
  you complained about a lack of response . 
  calling everyone cowards and this is your response ? 
  what a waste of my time . 
  let 's accept the 1967 borders for the sake of realism . 
  i see no arguments from you why europe should allow this current situation to continue ? 
  your first claim was ~ ~ qatar ~ ~ , now it 's the pointlessness of history ? 
  yeah , okay , let 's f -- k the un and agreements . 
  what about simple fairness ? 
  i 'm afraid you 're the ignorant one here . 
  the political movement was formally established by the austro-hungarian journalist theodor herzl in ** 1897 ** following the publication of his book der judenstaat . 
  vienna was the capital of austria-hungary , by the way , they certainly knew about his book in 1932 ( your reference ) . 
  okay , that 's an interesting view . 
  now , from your spelling i assume you 're french . 
  i know qatar has spent some money in france recently , but it has hardly bought off europe in general . 
  a little navel-gazing on your part ? 
  how do you reconcile [ the 1947 un partition resolution ] ( http://www.americanthinker.com/mfaj0d1q0.jpg ) with the present situation ? 
  should n't the palestinians get their state as well ? 
  my family 's jewish and i 've been to israel , but i do n't see the status quo as legal , fair or `` good '' . 
  the israelis are not stupid , they 're just playing for time . 
  the settlements are an obvious ploy to expand israeli territory in preparation for the inevitable statehood for palestine . 
  once east jerusalem and its environs are `` encircled '' it can be properly annexed . 
  it will be the future capital of israel . 
  we all understand the game here . 
  at least get your history in order . 
  - it was the idea of key jewish leaders that they should go to palestine . 
  - nazi-germany for example [ planned for a separate jewish homeland on the island of madagascar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagascar_plan ) . 
  the jews were not handed * all * of palestine in 1948 , they managed to do so on their own . 
  it was supposed to be two separate states . 
  oh , counterproductive . . that 's ironic . 
  svalbard archipelago , spitsbergen is the major island . 
  they did a horrible job with regards to norway , older european maps did much better . 
  i see they made our islands really prominent . 
  very interesting !, 
  while we 're already doing the wireless electricity and water meters here , the monitoring and power saving should be obligatory . 
  i really should recommend that my home town look at similar solutions . 
  hehe , the prices are n't double , but they are concomitant with salaries . 
  it does make * me * think when the prices are like this ( real life example ) : - nok 599 or $ 75.60 ( nok 499 would be $ 62.98 ) - sek 499 or $ 52.27 - dkk 499 or $ 66.91 this is obviously adjusted for purchasing power parity , but it 's so easy to feel cheated . 
  they teach this in economics/business 101 ; it 's price elasticity of demand/supply . 
   i had n't realised that era had arrived , let alone departed . 
  samsung 's top model [ galaxy s4 ] ( http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i9500_galaxy_s4-5125.php ) does n't come with radio , the s3 and earlier did . 
  the problem is that many do n't last long or ca n't get jobs at all . 
  the one 's you 're talking about are the lucky few , the highly functional . 
  this is about the other group , those who need more support to get and keep a job . 
  [ new york times ' article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/magazine/the-autism-advantage.html?ref=magazine&amp;_r=0 ) [ the guardian 's article ] ( https://socialenterprise.guardian.co.uk/en/articles/social-enterprise-network/2013/apr/30/social-innovation-denmark-welfare-system ) [ the economist 's article ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21556230 ), 
  it says right in the article that they 're often perfectionists , better at seeing patterns , and more loyal . 
  in some cases they 're cheaper , but that 's not the goal . 
  better and more precise work is worth paying for , especially for software companies . 
  here 's an new york times article called [ the autism advantage ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/magazine/the-autism-advantage.html?ref=magazine&amp;_r=0 ) . 
  your username suits a radio 4 listener , 
  radio ? 
  i stream the public broadcaster 's radio station ( s ) on my pc at work . 
  i actually tried the fm radio on my current phone for the first time a few weeks ago . 
  oh , but i do listen to it in my car now and then . 
  - norway 's public broadcaster , nrk , entertainment on [ p1 , p2 and p3/mp3 ] ( http://radio.nrk.no/ ) , news from nrk [ `` alltid nyheter '' ] ( http://radio.nrk.no/direkte/alltid_nyheter ) which broadcasts the bbc world service , [ nrk klassisk ] ( http://radio.nrk.no/direkte/klassisk ) and [ nrk jazz ] ( http://radio.nrk.no/direkte/klassisk ) - [ radio france internationale 's ( rfi ) news ] ( http://www.rfi.fr/ ) - some german station 's news podcasts - [ bbc radio 4 's comedy ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/fricomedy ), 
  it 's clearly not wrong in that sense . 
  the us trade balance with latin america is slightly better ( 2012 and so far 2013 ) . 
  i think both sides stand to lose a lot : - since 2002 , the eu has recorded a ** deficit ** in trade in goods with latin america . 
  - in 2010 , imports from latin america were valued at almost ** eur 90 billion ** . 
  good point , i was focusing on my own region though . 
  by comparison the two countries on either side of sweden look odd . 
  it 's almost as if it 's at the end of world , which for some it is ... 
  still , i agree , if it was * accurate * russia & co. would be represented properly . 
  it seems a bit odd that finland is so drawn so densely populated as opposed to my own country ? 
  - [ i merged two population density maps to illustrate ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uht26zj.png ) . 
  i realize the scale is not adjusted etc. 
  i see now that it 's made by spanish speakers , in general they 're not very familiar with my region . 
  i 'm guessing , but i assume you need to wait 90 days before re-entering as a tourist , since you have an expired student visa . 
  as a tourist : - during each 180-day period , you will have 90 days of visa-free travel within the schengen area . 
  - when you leave the schengen area after 90 days , you must wait another 90 days before you can apply to enter the schengen area again without a visa . 
  we import * when * we need it , not really what we need . 
  we could power ourselves if we had better infrastructure and storage facilities . 
  at least they 're working on bridging and connecting those regions that need better access . 
  i did n't say it was fair ( ! ), 
  that does n't mean anyone else wants to help , does it ? 
  the world is unfair . 
  as my country is not a member of the eu it does n't matter , but you would n't get any help from us . 
  we really ca n't handle more , we have too small a population . 
  yeah , i figured it was something like that , we do have the word in norwegian as well but it 's rarely used . 
   is there anyone who has n't spied on russia ? 
  no , and the same applies to them . 
  we all spy . 
  i imagine the russians already knew , since they were tapping the swedes [ and everyone else ] , 
  did you notice that thor energy 's thorium reactor is in halden ? 
  i do n't really see the other eu nations willingly taking in more migrants . 
  does your gov ' t really believe they will get support ? 
  it ca n't be that easy , they probably still have to do a lot of `` paperwork '' ? 
  just that now it 's tax and origin information . 
   breivik was sentenced to the norwegian pendant of forvaring , for example . 
  a piece of jewelry that hangs from a chain worn around the neck . 
  this `` pendant of forvaring '' gives the wearer 10 points of suffering !, 
  yeah , and norway is [ 99 % hydropowered ] ( http://www.statkraft.com/energy-sources/hydropower/ ) . 
  yes , of course , but i 'm also thinking about traffic just within norway . 
  transit countries are always a risk , that 's what i meant by `` despite ... geographical location ''  secondly , jottacloud claims file transfers to/from them are encrypted using 256-bit aes , but that wo n't really stop this kind of snooping if an intelligence agency `` controls '' your isp and uses deep packet inspection ... 
  even that * non-eu * norwegian service , which was mentioned on this subreddit earlier , i assume would ultimately be subject to similar laws or intelligence gathering .
