  despite encryption and geographical location . 
   to me , they have both dissolved their contract with me . 
  indeed . 
  you make some very good points . 
  we have been far too subservient for no good reason that i can think of . 
  truth be told , it 's always been a `` friendship '' of convenience and empty words [ on both sides ] . 
  i do n't really believe the us has europe 's best interests at heart , or at least not when they are in conflict with the us ' interests ... 
  balls ?!, 
  i 'd like to see them * break the law * regarding asylum applications ... 
  they would be put on trial , * riksrett * , for breaking constitutional law on separation of powers in no time at all by the opposition in parliament . 
  heck , members of the ruling parties would be among the first to indict them !, 
  it 's the law . 
  you ca n't ignore it just because you want to help someone . 
  it applies equally to muhammed from somalia as well as snowden . 
  norway and other european countries have standing armies , and do n't require american help . 
  technically neither does iceland since it 's actually other european nato forces that police their skies now . 
  there are no american troops in iceland any longer . 
  they closed up and left some time ago , the european partners have taken over that duty . 
   their governments spy on their citizens too , therefore we can also spy on them yeah , i 've gotten the same , i assume it 's some sort of cognitive dissonance . 
  after all i would n't want to accept that my gov ' t is doing something bad against our own * friends * either ( ! ), 
  i assume the us considers european nations friendly . 
  my gov ' t is legally entitled to spy on me , within reason , but the * foreign * gov ' t of the usa has no business spying in my country . 
  well , at least we had * fewer * wars than mainland europe . 
  oh , and the wars did n't ravage the countries to the same degree . 
  at least until modern times . 
  i suppose once we were united , it was rather stable . 
  oh , right , i missed that . 
  embarrassing . 
  i suppose russia should take it as a compliment of sorts . 
  powerful and feared . 
  i 'm afraid that 's a bit too positive . 
  we have had many wars between or against us . 
  it 's always been a rather hard place to live , so we never grew large populations or many great cities . 
  there are few great castles or huge cathedrals by comparison with say italy . 
  during the 19th century vast numbers of scandinavians emigrated to the us , mainly because of a sudden population increase and lack of land . 
  there are now more norwegian-americans than there are norwegians ( ! ), 
  hehe , well , * if * we ever get them ( delivery problems or cancellation ) . 
  i would n't mind the eurofighter or the rafale . 
  ~ ~ that 's strange ? 
  i 'm pretty sure a lot of norwegians learn german and/or french , as well as the * obligatory * english classes . 
  my brothers and i all had german in high school . ~ ~, 
   they make kebabs and ice cream in other parts of europe . 
  i think we have pakistanis , arabs , afghans or turks in those shops around here . 
   the f-35 is increasingly looking like some ridiculously expensive hardware . 
  what a joke , right ? 
  we just feel forced to buy it , and all the other alternatives are good enough for our needs . 
  who needs stealth when we 're usually bombing countries without active air forces ? 
  yeah , i 've heard that you 're reconsidering . 
  let 's just say i 'll only believe denmark buying something else when i see it ... norway `` looked '' at gripen in name only . 
  the french did n't bother to submit a tender , as they knew we would buy american to maintain the relationship with the us and nato . 
  hehe, 
  surprising use of pseudocode for this subreddit . 
  still , it should n't be that hard for non-programmers to understand . 
  yeah , i get it , 
  hehe , you 're cruel  still , we better get our act together as a region . 
   denied the lex usa [ this ] ( http://www.thelocal.ch/20130620/swiss-banks-slump-after-lex-usa-rejection ) really ought to be bigger news in all of europe . 
  thanks !, 
  i put the [ full data on google docs ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ai3e_jpydso5de9vqjdwzxbcv0tlumdfru1jwklcyue&amp;usp=sharing ) .

  which german tv series ? 
  you can borrow some of our artillery , [ just not fire it ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/det-svenske-forsvaret-star-helt-uten-eget-artilleri-7232461.html ) , 
   are prohibited from exporting customer data from the eu that 's the problem , * our * laws are not being obeyed . 
  us law `` supersedes '' local laws . 
  let me quote this very relevant article : - '' * microsoft 's u.k. head admitted today that no cloud data is safe from the patriot act , and the company can be forced to hand eu-stored data over to u.s. 
  authorities . 
  * '' http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/microsoft-admits-patriot-act-can-access-eu-based-cloud-data/11225, 
  it 's a bit different . 
  data * stored in europe * , but managed by american companies , is subject to us intelligence ... 
   but how about sweden ? 
  they record every message that comes and goes across their border , are n't you confusing the fact that a country has the right to police its own territory , but a * foreign * power has no right at all ? 
  one does not equal the other . 
  - sweden only looks at data that goes in and out of its own territory - the us looks at data going in and out of the us - and inside [ * other countries * ] ( http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/microsoft-admits-patriot-act-can-access-eu-based-cloud-data/11225 ) !, 
   what i 'm asking about is the actual data , which do n't contain real information , and why people are so concerned about you ca n't know anything real when you have metadata . 
  no real information ? 
  only metadata ? 
  according to [ the guardian ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data ) : * a chart prepared by the nsa , contained within the top-secret document obtained by the guardian , underscores the breadth of the data it is able to obtain : email , video and voice chat , videos , photos , voice-over-ip ( skype , for example ) chats , file transfers , social networking details , and more . 
  * are you still going to claim they only look at metadata ? 
  the `` metadata '' of my facebook profile ? 
  well , that * is * my profile , hehe . 
  the sound of my voice on skype ? 
  do you suppose they only record the pitch ? 
  no , i 'm sorry , they collect a lot more information than that or can access it at will . 
  that is * precisely * the problem , let 's answer that in the next paragraph :  yet our own countries do exactly the same thing to our own people firstly , that is a claim you make , i doubt you know my country 's secret service . 
  i dispute that they monitor us to the same degree . 
  let 's leave it at that . 
  however , whatever * my * gov ' t does is exactly the point i made previously . 
  it can be perfectly * legal * for them to keep tabs on our society . 
  if they trespass and violate our own laws they will pay for it . 
  that is if and when we find out about it . 
  any foreign power doing so is effectively attacking my state . 
  the us is trespassing on my freedom and privacy simply by having access and/or storing it . 
  the same would apply to other foreign countries * if * they did/do the same . 
  comparing what the us does with what my gov ' t does is ** not ** a valid argument !, 
   instead of jumping on the anti-usa `` us vs them '' bandwagon , we should look at all countries , not just the usa here . 
  yes , that is a fair point to make . 
  of course there does n't seem to be anyone else out there with similar capabilities or the will to do so !, 
  there 's also the fact that it is major american corporations that dominate the internet . 
  there is no french google in the us with similar capabilities , or chinese corporations for that matter .
