  sure , the chinese and europeans spy , but we do n't have access to your networks or citizens wholesale . 
  those american corporations , or their subsidiaries incorporated in europe , fail to abide by our/local laws . 
  the us gov ' t clearly , * knowingly * infringes on our sovereignty by requiring them to hand over information regardless of origin/location . 
  i do n't blame google for following us law , i blame the us gov ' t for abusing it . 
   what if this is actually legal ? 
  what is the bad thing here ? 
  i 'm afraid it 's the same answer as above . 
  the americans might have given * themselves * the laws needed to justify spying on foreigners . 
  it 's not entirely clear if what they 're doing is `` legal '' in the us either . 
  - the bad thing is that , as those foreigners they 're spying on , we have no legal remedy ; i.e. 
  we ca n't sue them , have them extradited for trial or punish them in any way . 
  - democracy and good governance requires accountability and they 've taken away part of our sovereignty as states and the right as citizens to impeach our government . 
  our secret services answer to us ultimately . 
  let 's note that * foreign * spies are illegal . 
  in my opinion this infringement is tantamount to an attack by a hostile power . 
  it 's the modern day equivalent of occupying a country 's telecom operator or broadcaster . 
  even if it 's done with the collusion of our government and officials . 
  it 's illegal for our officials to hand over our sovereignty . 
  it 's called being a traitor . 
   i do believe that they should act according to what the law prescribes yes , but * which * set of laws , american or european ?!, 
  the question is rhetorical because we already know american corporations in europe are subject to us law and agencies ... 
  in conclusion ; what rights are europeans citizens awarded by the us intelligence community or us corporations ? 
  absolutely none . 
  the gini index is useful , but not always conclusive . 
  the income distribution has changed over the last decades , so that also has some effect . 
  a doctor or manager ( 700k ) makes only a little more in terms of salary than an industrial worker ( 350k ) , and then there 's progressive taxes . 
  we redistribute a lot of wealth through taxes and welfare state payments ( at birth , maternal leave , free childcare etc ) . 
  there are many more european immigrants ( laborers ) here now , which do make considerably less on average . 
  most of the research done on scandinavia credits our social cohesion and the public support ( welfare state ) . 
   it explains scandinavia vs the rest , but then you should have inverted values between france and uk , ... 
  i 'm afraid we could write books on the subject and so they have , hehe . 
   where the prisoners were forced to eat lutefisk . 
  i do n't see the problem ? 
  can i move to this camp now ? 
   does anyone have an insight about any other value that seems correlated with this ? 
  in general scandinavia is known for income inequality , generous welfare state and social cohesion ( rights , a stronger sense of representation , functioning of democracy and sense of confidence in the future ) . 
  there 's less need for police if people do n't have to steal to survive . 
  i added [ this map with the data table ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eu7bl8a ) . 
  here is [ a map representation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eu7bl8a ) using the 2009 data . 
  okay , [ this is my quick version of the map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pc71zox )  police officers per 100,000 citizens ( 2009 ) according to the table : - finland 156 - norway 159,2 did i miss something here ? 
  2011 numbers : - finland 8 161 officers / 5 375 276 citizens = 151,8 - norway 7 684 officers / 4 920 305 citizens = 156,2, 
  uh , that last one makes norway and finland look odd ... 
  we only export to `` approved '' states , such as the us ... - we supply ammo for the barrett sniper rifle , specifically [ the .50 cal anti-tank ammunition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raufoss_mk_211 ) , which when used on humans literally blows them apart . 
  - [ remotely-controlled weapons stations ( crows ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protector_\\ ( rws \\ ) ) for their apcs etc, 
    queue greeks moaning . 
   cue to be fair , those greeks in a queue probably * are * moaning , right on cue !, 
  they really ought to include norway 's svalbard archipelago on the map !, 
  it 's an integral part of the kingdom . 
  - it has [ really fast access to the internet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svalbard_undersea_cable_system ) ( above 1,280 gigabits per second ) . 
  - all due to [ the satellite downlink base there ] ( http://www.fastcompany.com/48533/where-heck-svalbard ) serving [ clients such as nasa/esa ] ( http://www.ksat.no/ ) and [ the svalbard university centre ] ( http://www.unis.no/ ) !, 
  ironically they 're more online than most people in the world . 
  they 're just few people , with a large landmass !, 
  it 's a shame ; russia truly has a great story to tell !, 
  today 's politics and economic situation is hardly what defines you as a people . 
  oh , how i would like people to know more about russia . 
  - from kiev rus to your great authors and composers - from the magnificent streets of st. petersburg , to the natural beauty of siberia . 
  - sunny beaches , great mountains , awesome plains , massive forests and frozen seas . 
  what does n't russia have ? 
  i for one would love to travel by boat to the white sea , and by train across russia to the far east . 
  you 're not europe 's `` enemy '' , your one of our greatest cultures ever . 
  it will take a few generations to regain that image . 
  i would be quite proud if my country was summed up as `` cheese , wine and napoleon '' , 
  oh , i do n't object to * the idea * itself . 
  no , i was very pro-eu a few years back , as a matter of fact . 
  i even volunteered for the young european federalists ( jef ) . 
  i believe that european federalism is inevitable in the long run . 
  it 's a successful recipe ( see us ) and probably a necessity to compete with other large countries/blocks such as china , other brics etc. 
  that does n't mean we all have to join right now , or that the smaller countries wo n't do better outside the eu as niche players ... 
   the big states have by far the most power yes , i 'm afraid that 's what matters in the end . 
  there 's power in numbers , and we will never have great ( er ) numbers . 
   with regards to icelandic membership i 'd call this quite acceptable oh , i 'm sure you would quickly find reasons to object to eu policies . 
  the efta-eu agreement is limited for a reason . 
  are you sure you want to trust their fishing policy and share your waters with spanish trawlers ? 
  here in norway we 're quite upset at the moment that the eu wants to force their new safety regulations for oil/gas platforms on us , despite the fact that their standards are much * lower * !, 
  we believe it 's outside of the eea 's scope as well . 
  thanks , that was actually interesting . 
  oh , we would !, 
  that is if we were to join , 
   a huge corruption scandal in military intelligence service . 
  what exactly happened ? 
  making 800,000 free condoms with holes ? 
  or are we simply one of * those * worlds ? 
  i bet he simply went home !, 
  again , i 'm not spanish , but i believe the key difference is * los * and * la * . 
  it 's the [ one ] union of soviet republics , but the many united * states * ( plural ) . 
  the eu is also just one union , so it 's called * la ue * . 
  a family has many members , but it 's also one unit . 
  verbose ; using or expressed in more words than are needed . 
  i only learned a little spanish in school , but if i remember correctly it 's la union sovietica ( singular ) , unlike * los estados * ( plural ) . 
  according to wikipedia the full name was la uni\u00f3n de rep\u00fablicas socialistas sovi\u00e9ticas ( urss ) . 
  it 's the plural form of states . 
  the plural is expressed by doubling the initial letter in spanish acronyms . 
  it 's the plural form of states . 
  the plural is expressed by doubling the initial letter in spanish acronyms . 
  yes , estados unidos . 
  as you can tell they do n't call it the `` eu '' , while they call the european union the `` ue '' ( la uni\u00f3n europea ) . 
  the french also call the european union the `` ue '' . 
   eeuu or japan the `` eeuu '' means very little to non-spanish speakers , as you probably know it 's the us [ in english ] . 
  yeah , we 'd order chinese food to be delivered . 
    at least with that time scale .
