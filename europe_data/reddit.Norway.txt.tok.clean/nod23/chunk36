   it has just been becoming more homogenous at a very , very slow rate . 
  i 'm afraid you might have missed what i wrote ? 
    as residents of different eu countries tend to move around more because of the economic situation . 
  the eu dreams of this , but unless you 're spanish or greek it has n't really been interesting for western europeans . 
  i wo n't mention the obvious polish plumber etc. 
   let alone on the streets that 's what i meant by mentioning the historic quarters of major cities . 
  we do move around in europe , always have done , but we tend to stay within our own areas . 
  as time passes we exchange and integrate more closely . 
   flirts with communism are you referring to communism specifically or socialism/social-democracy ? 
   there seems to be a strong link between no , [ the data says otherwise ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wy7jomd ) . 
  how do you come to that conclusion ? 
  - ex-communist romania ( 7.3 % ) and czechia ( 7.2 % ) have lower rates than the democratic uk ( 7.7 % ) and sweden ( 8.4 % ) - seeing as capitalist spain ( 26.8 % ) and greece ( 27.0 % ) have the biggest problem ? 
  neither have been communist . 
  - germany and austria have the lowest numbers of them all , both typical social-democratic regimes . 
  in fact both spain and greece have been ruled by right-wing authoritarian regimes . 
  in modern times spain was wrecked by private and public `` investments '' in real estate etc. 
  greece can hardly be accused of `` socialist '' spending , if anything they had a * kleptocracy * . 
  the way i see it you ca n't blame eastern europe for high unemployment when they 've barely had a few decades to recover from sudden market transitions . 
  i would love to see the numbers from `` slowpoke '' belarus !, 
   it will be more homogenous 10 years from now . 
  that 's very unrealistic , at least with * that * time scale . 
  there 's a reason there are enclaves around europe from past migration waves . 
  look at rome ; jewish quarter , french quarter , spanish quarter . 
  we tend to mix over generations , not mere decades . 
  by that i mean culturally and not dna . 
  that 's hilarious !, 
  you can see the progression from ich to i ( the singular form of first person ) in english from our languages . 
  interestingly , we already have `` i '' in some norwegian dialects , but e/eg / \u00c6 / je/jei are more common . 
  oh , okay then , 
   the sami language also belongs to the same language family . 
  oddly enough . 
  odd ? 
  it 's not that odd . 
  the finns and sami both came from what is russia today . 
  i 'm not talking about the bits the russians took from finland in the last two centuries . 
  while scandinavians migrated from present day germany or thereabouts , from denmark across to scania and northwards . 
  til it 's so obvious now !, 
   the swede thought for a moment and spoke : '' \u00d6 , \u00f6 , h\u00f6-\u00f6 , h\u00f6-\u00f6ns m\u00f6 . '', 
  norwegian does n't quite fit that pattern : `` o ' \u00f8ya , \u00f8ya , grass\u00f8ya , grass\u00f8ym\u00f8ya ! '', 
   we 'll even bring the whiskey . 
  that settles it !, 
   inequality , it has nothing to do with poverty or crime . 
  it 's pretty clear that inequality and poverty has a close relationship with crime . 
   we 're much more populous and diverse country than any country in western europe , if you 're generalizing europe has several times the population and [ a slightly larger geographic area ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jp03bux ) . 
  we do have fairly similar levels of welfare across the board . 
   i 'm not quite sure what you 're getting at with the kindergarten thing it 's how you finance it . 
   most people in this country are middle income home owners , who send their kids to public schools ( which are free ) and receive health care through their jobs i 'm not sure statistics agree with you in that regards . 
  sorry , i have to leave now , would love to chat more . 
  i certainly would n't want someone from a less liberal country in that seat ... 
  oh , i know , i 'm always on the lookout for news about the snp , salmond and the upcoming referendum . 
  i believe cameron and his pet are making it easier for you to decide . 
  never mind farage and ukip . 
  we have a lot more in common now than the islands after all ; from fishing quotas to wind farms . 
  the scottish sector is important to us as well . 
  hehe , i think we 'd gladly include all of scotland , 
  we would gladly take shetland , orkney and isle of man back :d, 
  you already have the euro-med programme ? 
  you can have the [ euro-med partnership ] ( http://www.eeas.europa.eu/euromed/index_en.htm ) , hehe , 
  the way i look at it , it 's a specialization for those with specific interests . 
  general : - / r/europe is for europeans and everyone else - / r/nordiccountries is for nordic citizens and everyone else special : - / r/nordicunion appears to be a quasi-political `` campaign '' uniquely focused on nordic citizens ' input, 
  different goals ? 
   terrorism in europe was always fueled by nationalism rather than religion . 
  it has n't been confined to just nationalism though . 
  i can think of a number of assorted cases : - germany and italy : political extremist terrorism ( [ raf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction ) ) - norway : religious/political nutcase ( anders breivik ) - ireland : nationalist , religious and political terrorism - bulgaria : hezbollah attack on israeli tourists - russia : chechen bombings due to religion/nationalism - germany : neo-nazi murder squad , aimed to stop non-whites reproducing - bulgaria : [ attack on turkish minority political party ] ( http://rt.com/news/bulgaria-dogan-gun-turkish-330/ ), 
   i think that 4th generation ... will adopt the general values of your nation . 
  one can only hope , and i certainly do hope so . 
  the reality is that in many european countries groups of immigrants from several countries have created enclaves and remain rather `` insulated '' from the society they live in . 
  the flow of new arrivals help it remain connected to the country of origin . 
  it 's a challenge for many countries to integrate them properly . 
   tax credits are a spending program though they are in a budget debate , which is the article 's point , but in real terms it 's not . 
  hold your downvotes for a moment . 
   the only difference is that high income families will end up getting a smaller tax bill , while lower income families will receive money back . . 
  which is my point exactly , * that * does n't result in equal access . 
   it does n't matter if welfare is being distributed through the tax code or through direct cash transfers oh , it does matter . 
  this is going to be a little specific . 
  take for example public childcare , in my own country every child is entitled to a kindergarten seat regardless of their parents ' income or profession . 
  - it means single mothers or immigrants can work * full time * instead of spending more money [ proportionally ] than a nuclear family . 
  - it 's an equalizer . 
  research shows that attending kindergarten gives children of immigrants better language skills and social integration . 
  which means better education , less poverty and crime . 
  - children in general do better in school when they attend kindergarten . 
  the `` american '' alternative is a small cash amount , as you said . 
  the wealthy do n't care , the rest of us do ( middle classes ) . 
  in many countries including the us and uk , that small amount does n't even cover the basic childcare cost . 
  what you get for your money also matters , because a public kindergarten is regulated and staffed here . 
  they may be run by privately held companies . 
  - in the uk it 's so expensive mothers often quit their jobs and stay at home . 
  so the labor market loses a worker , society loses an investment [ in her education ] , the child loses integration and social skills that matter in its development and education . 
  what i assume you might not like is that many europeans accept that we pay an `` unfair '' amount of taxes . 
  there is no school tax where i live , but we have * proportional * tax systems . 
  the majority pays for services they might not use , such as kindergartens or schools , but it benefits us all . 
  the effect is a more equal and balanced society . 
  the gini coefficient index is one way of shining a little light on things . 
  it shows a much better income distribution , less poverty and less crime in [ western ] european countries . 
  if you want to dream of getting rich , live in the us ; if you want to afford to have a family and give your kids an education ... 
  what a massive troll !, 
  haha , you 're funny . 
  not even one of those statements were credible or factual . 
  is it taken straight from the book of `` american clich\u00e9s '' ? 
   social spending in the u.s. is far above the organization 's average .
