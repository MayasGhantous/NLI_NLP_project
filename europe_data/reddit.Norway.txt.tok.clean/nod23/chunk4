  not including the swiss guard that lives there ? 
  you ca n't say the same about norway . 
  i do n't know about finland . 
  people living in big cities rent . 
  norway has always been more rural and has an ownership oriented culture . 
  people live for their houses and cabins . 
  it 's strange how different oslo and stockholm are in that sense . 
  free market in oslo , problematic in stockholm . 
  yeah , i know , that 's why i showed him the cold map , 
  nah , it 's just like the `` kirk '' in scotland and norway ; same spelling , different pronunciation . 
  i was thinking more about the norwegian cities [ within the arctic circle ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sg5gw6t.gif ) and in our northern territories ; both [ mainland ] ( http://images.hanneketravels.net/tromso_kirkenes.jpg ) and [ further north ( svalbard etc ) ] ( http://images.summitpost.org/original/710879.jpg ), 
  along the coast that 's [ heated by the gulf stream ] ( http://gogreencanada.ucoz.com/gulfstream.gif ) ? 
  it 's not even far north in norway ? 
  well , i ca n't exactly expect you to know [ where it 's actually cold in norway ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8iqxl7j.png ) , 
  despite the article i think your description is rather nasty and unfair . 
  `` norwegians rip off french taxpayer '' ? 
  that would be norwegian car * dealership * takes advantage of french state . 
  it 's a bit less hostile and confrontational . 
  in any case we 're talking about a fraction of the total sales . 
  yeah , but they apply * now * - and not after 50k/2017 , 
   so who pays for the roads ? 
  road maintenance is financed over the national budget like everything else . 
  it 's just that the car ownership fees are put into the * general * pool of revenue , and not specifically used only for road maintenance . 
  you 're using the correct percentage , but you 're missing the vital keywords . 
  it 's the annual surplus from our swf 's investments . 
  we 're trying to avoid touching the capital and only skim off the top . 
   inflation well , we 're trying to avoid domestic inflation , but mainly it 's a matter of not eating the capital . 
  the fund has done well , in some respects , but in others the true rate of return has been below our consumption . 
  if you landed during summer , due to the increase in traffic volume , the staff are usually temporary and half-skilled . 
  it helps if you land at oslo gardermoen ( osl ) and not smaller budget airports ... 
   even though we have shitloads of free oil . 
  drug dealers know ; do n't use your own supply . 
  secondly , it 's all run by private corporations . 
  the oil is not free at any level . 
  the state just collects taxes at various levels including ownership of statoil stocks . 
   the oil money buys the roads and maintains them if you think we spend our oil & gas revenue your sadly mistaken . 
  norway 's budget is primarily income/capital/sales tax financed . 
  we invest our oil & gas money abroad ( swf ) . 
  owners of normal gas driven cars pay a yearly fee that 's supposed to finance roads and maintenance . 
  it does n't actually go towards that , but that 's another matter . 
  he means toll roads are free of charge for electric vehicles ( bomringer ) . 
  thank you for the very accurate description of our situation . 
  during winter the pollution from cars/traffic dust in oslo has become problematic and a real health issue . 
   norway 's tax hikes no , because `` hikes '' literally means `` a sharp increase '' . 
  these are the taxes we 've had for decades !, 
  there 's nothing new about them . 
  the electric cars however enjoy the * absence * of those taxes . 
  oslo is far south though , northern norway is north of canada again . 
  yeah , * one * dealership that imported 40 cars . 
  meanwhile tesla sold 3000 cars in norway . 
  i 'm saying it 's in stark constrast to those that * are * members . 
  wow , that sounds pretty bad . 
  i suppose it does attract tourists ? 
  hehe , yes , i imagined the root was closer to yours than mine , 
   the moment we have huge photoshopped cocks on buses ... would not surprise me , denmark !, 
  interesting , i often think how strange it must be for tourists to visit my country only to find no ads along the roads at all ( forbidden by law ) . 
  romanian is an interesting language !, 
  `` tramway in trial [ run ] '' , right ? 
  it 's somewhat similar to my own language : '' [ tramway ] i pr\u00f8ve '' ( not accurate grammar ) . 
  a stark contrast to the eu members . 
  i suppose some of those other capitals may have received eu funding for infrastructure projects . 
  i think i rememer reading about a domestic bus construction company and some sort of virtual `` monopoly '' ? 
  is that the source of the trashy buses ? 
   norway is , in regards to being independent , a young country with a proud population . 
  we 're not exactly a young country in every respect . 
  admittedly , our patriotism is very strong due to the periods of less than full sovereignty . 
  however , the unified norwegian state was established around the year 800 . 
  the various unions never removed norway from the map , but we became less than sovereign . 
  the norwegian state however existed all the same , with its ** own ** separate laws , administration and currency . 
   i do think people are more concerned with the financial situation currently . 
  if i represented the anti-eu forces in norway i would say that we prefer the * financial independence * being outside gives us . 
  while i agree that we 're not exactly free or completely outside ( eea ) , the freedom we * do * have is something italy and other eu members miss dearly now !, 
  the italians would just have devalued their currency and avoided a lot of the problems they now have to suffer as eurozone members . 
  norway 's currency is a problem for exporting industries , but it was a `` safe haven '' during the crisis . 
  that caused other problems for us , but lenders were more than willing to lend money to the norwegian state ( bonds ) . 
  placing money in norwegian banks was attractive and safe . 
   it 's not like we are completely independent now , with schengen , eea , etc. 
  the schengen agreement was not originally part of the eu 's framework . 
  passport control was never really strict to begin with for norway ( nordic passport union since 1952 ) , and it 's only for eu europeans anyway . 
  the eea however is a very , very good point . 
  haha , norway does n't `` fuck '' with russian fishing boats !, 
  it 's russian fishing boats and * your * government that is fucking with norway . 
  russian fishermen and companies are nothing but troublesome , law breaking amateurs ; owned by gangsters and other scum . 
  the russian government does n't care about keeping fish stocks healthy ( by not overfishing or harvesting small fish ) or environmental pollution . 
  you can destroy your own stocks , but do n't fish in our waters !, 
  for fun i 'll add that the second republic used this as [ the great seal of france ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/grand_sceau_de_la_r%c3%a9publique_fran%c3%a7aise_image001.gif ), 
   there are few poland citizens who wants to fight for ukraine are you sure about that ? 
  you may not want to , but it seems at least your leaders hold different views . 
  [ the visegrad group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group ) goes some way towards that goal without involving nato ? 
   eu has no real international power and is not a significant political player i do n't quite agree with you about these points . 
  the eu 's economic and political power is only growing . 
  - eu legislation has seen major changes in markets and products around the world for example electronics mfg and [ rohs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/restriction_of_hazardous_substances_directive ) . 
  the same can be said for a number of other areas of importance including medicines , education , accounting/finance and product safety . 
  - the political power is quite evident in for example the iranian talks ; it 's the us , eu and iran that hold the talks . 
  i always think about the original in the jardin du luxembourg , paris , 
   cause union is not really interested in ukraine joining eu zone okay , but that 's sort of the only protection i see as valid ( military ) . 
  the eu does n't have the resources yet , but poland & co have committed to protecting ukraine with their combined military forces . 
  as for the eu 's intentions ; i believe they 'll want ukraine close , but not as close as poland . 
  the neighborhood policy is made for that . 
  they 're evaluating expanding the eea , see efta and the eea , to offer a `` second tier '' for countries that wo n't be allowed in fully ( see turkey etc ) .
