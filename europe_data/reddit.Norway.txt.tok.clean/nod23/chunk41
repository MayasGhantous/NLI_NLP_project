  it 's sadly the * only * thing most swedes know about norway ... oil , fish and high wages . 
  why wo n't you love us back !, 
  actually , in many professions it 's not far from that ... 
  if you do n't mind reading norwegian this article points out that in many cases it 's at least 50 % higher : http://e24.no/naeringsliv/flytt-til-norge-og-tjen-fett/20121639, 
  it does n't matter if it 's more `` expensive '' than what you pay abroad . 
  what matters is * how long we have to work * to pay the same amount . 
  take this inaccurate example : - 1 norwegian salary/hour = 100 nok - 1 swedish salary/hour = 100 sek , or 87.66 nok paying for a 113 nok pizza will still be cheaper for the norwegian worker than the swedish worker ... in terms of worked hours . 
  it 's called purchasing power parity . 
   they need to take local average wage into account . 
  people that do n't know about purchasing power parity will make that mistake . 
   one can dream about having the highest salaries and the lowest prices . 
  that situation can only be realized if the people doing the menial jobs get paid peanuts . 
  which is why the gini coefficient ( s ) is so interesting , 
  yes , still , the average wage in norway is a lot higher than almost any other european country . 
   students . 
  yeah , people with jobs are usually the measure . 
  students are usually broke for all sorts of reasons  i worked during my studies and could easily afford 100 nok/day on food . 
  it was my budget in fact . 
  less than 5 years ago . 
   before tax . 
  yes , that is worth noting , but i only wanted to illustrate the sums in general . 
  i can easily afford to spend  100 nok per day on food . 
  who does n't ? 
  i assume you agree it 's easily affordable for a takeout pizza . 
   `` the situation might be bad , but [ insert relevant group ] has it worse '' well , not in the case of norway , the prices are `` higher '' than yours , but not adjusted for purchasing power . 
   even on a norwegian salary , it was n't cheap . 
  i strongly disagree . 
  as a norwegian , $ 15 ( ~ 113 nok ) for a pizza is * not * expensive or troublesome on the average norwegian salary ( 450,000 nok ) . 
  the average wage is now around gbp 50 530 , $ 59 746 or 450 000 nok . 
  [ norwegian source ( 2011 ) ] ( http://www.na24.no/article3365675.ece ), 
  hehe , damn * swedes * , 
  yeah , i 'd rather go for technocracy . 
   romania 's rompetrol in norwegian the company name * rompetrol * means `` ass trolls '' or [ tadpoles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tadpole ) !, 
  it 's actually a norwegian company originally , but swedish ica group bought them later on . 
  rimi * is * norwegian , but swedish ica purchased the group . 
  rimi sounds like `` rimelig '' in norwegian ( well priced ) . 
  the competition is called rema . 
  you make some fine points  i think i would prefer a meritocracy/technocracy though over a vote . 
   i 'd say it is both an anti-tax and anti-immigration party . 
  in a norwegian context it may sound correct , but in a wider european context it 's wrong . 
  the progress party is nothing like front national , golden dawn or even the sweden democrats . 
  we 're doing ourselves as a nation a disfavor here by applying that label . 
  i really do n't want that stink on my country 's politics . 
   many of the voters , and many of their politicians view immigration as their main most important issue that 's just not fair on the party . 
  they have a wealth of opinions , members and voters . 
  are all conservative voters snobs ? 
  are all centrists farmers ? 
  are labor voters ready for an armed revolution ? 
   ( the last bit may not apply any longer )  is the most important political issue in our time that does n't make the party a one issue party though - or it 's core appeal . 
  tomorrow it will be something else that 's `` the most important in our time ''   61 % of people in the party says immigration is the most important , while 16,6 % says lower taxes . 
  hmm , yes , but we have to judge them on what they write and publish as their programme . 
  that 's the guiding document their party congress voted on and approved , that 's what guides their representatives in parliament . 
  statistics and polls are not exactly truths . 
  yes , i see , but that 's just another aspect of the same problem . 
  voters expect that they will get what they vote for . 
  that is not always possible , especially with coalitions . 
  we have the same problem here in norway , [ which i addressed in the last sentence of my comment ] . 
  the british system with `` first past the post '' results in stronger governments with more power to implement their policies . 
  that 's the weakness of our system ( s ) . 
   i think it 's fair to label them as such considering they are the only party in norway that has that as one of their main policies . 
  that is incorrect , as far as i can tell . 
  have you seen their program ? 
  * '' i believe the only party that is actually pro-immigration is the libe ral party ( v ) . 
  i do n't think any other party in parliament supports immigration ? 
  they all reacted to the progress party by implementing stricter policies themselves . 
  i have never voted for them myself . 
   we would still elect parties directly like we are now and you can exclude votes for people already . 
  i 've guided people at the voting booths . 
  sorry , but people are idiots . 
  they ca n't even put their votes in a box , let alone nominate/strike people from the present ballot   i 'm thinking more like voting on country changing things i 'm not sure we would benefit from that overall , in some cases maybe , but people do n't want to hear uncomfortable truths - or to make painful , but neccessary decisions . 
  when push comes to shove people will react like spoiled children ; `` me first '' . 
  norway needs to make some serious changes over the coming decades . 
  it wo n't happen until we 're over the edge and bleeding because cutting back and preparing in advance will be unpopular . 
   considering how far up eu 's ass the politicians are and how many directives ( above 99 % ) we are implementing . 
  yes , but we have to implement them to remain part of the eea . 
  our compliance is fueled by self-interest . 
  we do have a choice , but i doubt leaving the eea would be beneficial in the short and long term . 
  we need trade access and bilateral agreements is frowned upon by the eu ( see switzerland ) . 
  well , the map supports your conclusion  iceland and norway are rank the highest and are outside the eu - but russia takes away from your argument . 
  oh , the irony , liberalism in europe is * classic * liberalism , i.e. 
  what you americans call `` libertarianism '' . 
  when they key factor is how well your * government * is functioning i can see why belgium is n't highly ranked , 
   politicians have broken campaign promises time and again that 's not always the fault of politicians though , it 's not a supermarket of ideas where your vote is a * quid pro quo * . 
  i wish my co-citizens would accept and understand that : - if the party in question does n't win a majority or the power to push through their goals they did n't break their promises . 
  - if the economic situation [ or other factors ] does n't permit the implementation of said goals it 's not a broken promise . 
  it 's a terrible state of affairs when citizens believe they 're not getting what they deserve because it 's not to their personal liking . 
  democracy is the tyranny of the majority , but governments rarely have a majority [ here ] . 
  i would assume money . 
  i believe belgium comes out worst , and wallonia is the poorest part ? 
  or politics in the case of kosovo . 
  [ kosovo is not recognized by all eu members ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_recognition_of_kosovo ) , i assume that means that eurostat ca n't include them for political reasons . 
  you 're confusing your political views for democracy . 
  iceland is a greaty country , but that single action does n't describe their political culture and system of government accurately . 
  how do they tackle other issues , is what you should be asking . 
  oh , yeah , i 'd really like to see the wonderful characters we 'd elect directly ... 
  that is simply wrong . 
  the progress party was founded and still is an ** anti-tax ** party . 
  they 're not in favor of immigration , but your portrayal is misleading . 
   you are only a person if your last name is `` saud '' a key word is missing ; it does n't apply to * bint * saud . 
   open borders .
