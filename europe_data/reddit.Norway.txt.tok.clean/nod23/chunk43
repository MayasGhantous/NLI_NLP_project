   think it would be better to kill the whale that lived a happy live in the wild , than cow that stayed in a crowded box for all her live and that 's the reason i 'm all for hunting wild game . 
  you would find many who agree with you here . 
  norwegians love to hunt wild game during the various seasons . 
  moose , deer , capercaillie etc. 
  cattle farming is substantially different in europe from the us . 
  heck , in my country you must provide each cow with its own mattress by law   of course , that would n't be sustainable for the whole human population that is past 7 billions ( or milliards ) , so we do need to farm animals . 
  insects could replace them if we were willing to and vegetarians are good for our environment . 
   points that killing whales is done in a sustainable and humane way were already done , so that leaves the last question - is it moral ? 
  is it the same to kill a whale and a pig or a cow ? 
  yes , as long as we 're willing to kill animals for food or money , there is no difference between [ killing ] them or pigs . 
  i know it 's `` old hat '' , but it 's accurate to compare them as they 're both intelligent animals . 
  people have a tendency to forget that we 're also animals ; when we 're desperate enough we 'll kill to survive . 
  while i do n't like to know that dogs , cats or apes are killed abroad , i do recognize that it 's cultural . 
  would i prefer it if they did n't ? 
  yes !, 
  the noble feeling of being caretakers of this world is a luxury people in the developed world have . 
  in the end i hope we do get to a place where we can all be exactly that . 
  at which point killing for food should be unnecessary . 
  i 've never seen a slaughterhouse , but i know the reality is supposedly shocking . 
  the fact that we do n't know what we eat is a blessing . 
  when people lived on a farm and slaughtered/ate what they raised it was a more honest relationship . 
  the respect stereotypical african maasai show their cattle is fascinating !, 
  they 're not antiqued or uneducated people either they just preserved their ways . 
  my father grew up on the family farm ; he has told me many stories about their livestock and the love they had for their animals . 
  every christmas the local farmers would get together for the slaughter and each farmer knew every animal they killed . 
  i must admit that raw meat smells slightly bad to me when i have n't eaten it for a while . 
  fish is not in the same category as red/white meat to me . 
   i said norway can afford not whaling oh , yes , but my point was that we 're actually quite reliant on our natural resources . 
  whales are just another resource . 
  fisheries are more important than ever due to the low oil prices . 
  my point was that norway is not dependent on oil & gas because we 've been preparing for its demise . 
  we 've saved our cash and invested it abroad . 
  we 've been ~ 99 % hydro-electric since the late 1800s . 
   i ca n't watch the videos at work and articles are not in a language i know . 
  they 're just amusing or beautiful . 
  google chrome should translate them for you automatically ? 
  good for you and other aspects of our environment . 
  it 's not for me though . 
   hat means you are not hypocrites and , sure , that makes you better than japan , but still does n't make it right . 
  right ? 
  it 's legal , that 's all i can claim for certain . 
  is slaughtering any animal for food morally wrong ? 
  if you feel strongly about it i hope you live by your code ? 
  put your food where your mouth is  personally , i would prefer to avoid eating any animal , if that becomes possible in the future . 
   it 's either eating whales or the whole economy goes to shit , but that does n't work for norway . 
  we harvest * all * of our marine resources in a sustainable fashion ; first and foremost in the best interest of our environment - and secondly for our fisheries industry . 
  if you 're under the impression that norway is all about oil & gas i have to point out that it represents 25 % of our gdp . 
  while fisheries have always been hugely important and our primary export together with forestry products and minerals ( iron ore , silver etc ) . 
  we truly value our environment as we know what happens if we spoil it . 
   if we stopped hunting would it mean we see more and friendlier whales ? 
  i 'm curious what you think . 
  they 're already very friendly ?

  thank you for confirming what i suspected , 
   as far as i remember , only japan and norway did n't stopped industrial whaling . 
  their attitude looks to me like the asshole neighbor that waters his garden in the middle of a drought and when confronted says `` you all are saving water , so it 's fine if i use a more . '', 
  you are very ignorant of the facts !, 
  japan and norway are on ** opposite ** sides of the world and law !, 
  - japan agreed to the moratorium , but breaks the agreement by claiming they 're doing it for scientific research ( as permitted by the iwc ) . 
  - norway objected prior the enactment of the moratorium and is legally exempt . 
  our whaling is entirely legal according to the iwc and international law . 
  secondly , the most important aspect you ignored is that we fish/whale in ** different ** waters and species of whale !, 
  - japan fishes in the south antarctic in * international * waters . 
  - the whale species norway hunts are ** non-threatened ** ( north atlantic minke whale ) in * our * arctic waters . 
   i think it 's wrong and cruel . 
  i hope you avoid meat in general ? 
   there are many species that are extinct in our waters what waters though ? 
  some whale species stocks are non-threatened ( see north atlantic ) . 
   cultural arguments are what allows china , japan and so on to keep on whaling uh , no ? 
  they 're using * legal * arguments and japan is abusing the `` scientific research '' clause . 
  what deals ? 
  the [ iwc ] moratorium is by definition a temporary measure not a `` ban '' , it was enacted so that the stocks would resupply . 
  as for norway we * legally * hunt whales since the moratorium does n't apply to us ( see legal objection prior to the enactment ) . 
  no cultural arguments needed for us , the faroes or iceland . 
   they also get indirectly money through denmark from the eu . 
  can you provide a source for that claim ? 
  in that case i 'm not `` surprised how often people confuse the two '' , 
  i assumed it was more general . 
  yeah , we only use `` f\u00f3r '' in a particular context ( he went away very fast ) . 
  we use `` reise '' or `` g\u00e5 '' in general . 
  hehe , very amusing !, 
  oh , right , that 's the link .

  you swedes tend to guess `` nynorsk '' when it 's strange , 
  is your nick basque inspired ? 
  uh , yeah , it 's the exact same thing in norwegian . . 
  i did n't ask about `` f\u00e5r '' , i asked about `` for '' ,
