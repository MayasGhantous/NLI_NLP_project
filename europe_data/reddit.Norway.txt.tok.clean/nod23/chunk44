  duck is '' * and * '' in the scandinavian languages , apparently it 's '' * eend * '' in dutch . 
  sk\u00e5l means `` saucer '' today [ in norwegian ] ; and people used to drink their tea/coffee using the * saucer * !, 
  now , that 's a serious burn . 
  too bad they lost their longest word '' * rindfleischetikettierungsueberwachungsaufgabenuebertragungsgesetz * '' or law delegating beef label monitoring . 
  now , it 's just '' * donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapitaenswitwe * '' meaning widow of a danube steamboat company captain . 
  i suppose you guys have the same words ? 
  - for ( for/to ) - f\u00f3r ( went [ away ] ) - f\u00f2r ( furrow ) - f\u00f4r ( fodder ), 
  damn , i was looking for that one , could n't find it . 
  i 'll steal and translate it , okay ? 
  in some norwegian dialects you can build minimalist sentences : '' \u00e6 e i a \u00e6 \u00e5 '' - i 'm in place-called-a , me too '' \u00e5 \u00e6 e s\u00e5 gla i d\u00e6 '' - and i 'm so fond of you '' \u00e6 e tr\u00f8nder \u00e6 '' - i 'm a person from tr\u00f8ndelag, 
  yeah , fair enough , he did rent . 
  he was an older man though and married etc. 
  when i think about it was the hotel 's restaurant . 
  romania 's new tourist slogan ? 
   you could moor your own boat close by . 
  sold . 
  i 'll buy one , 
  i remember talking with a waiter at some restaurant about the cost of living . 
  i was amazed at the low wages , the cost of commuting alone is pretty steep , right ? 
  was n't there something about the police cracking down on free riders a few years back ? 
  i 've seen some really nice apartments in the city center though . 
   a former farm ... after selling the agricultural land ... and rebuilt it myself sounds like a great deal !, 
  okay , i see , thanks . 
  it does n't look too different from the generic tower blocks from the 50-70s in my opinion . 
  those balconies are common here on both high-rises and apartment blocks . 
  oh , i 've been thinking about visiting romania  my company has outsourced some work to a partner there . 
  my parents went there on holiday once , before i was born , during the ceau\u0219escu era . 
  they said it was weird , but nice . 
  how does it compare with gdansk ? 
  i hear polish people in the border area are buying property in germany rather than poland due to the prices . 
   do you live in oslo ? 
  i can imagine it 's very pricey there . 
  oslo is very pricey . 
  it 's ranked among the most expensive cities in the world . 
  there are a number of reasons ; high construction costs due to salaries and technical requirements , local regulation against high-rises , limited expansion due to protected forest zone , commuter traffic problems , 72.000 students at various colleges , european and extra-european immigration . 
  other cities in norway can be equally expensive , especially in the `` oil capital '' of stavanger . 
  our second city , bergen , is squeezed in between mountains and fjords . 
  outside of oslo however you can get pretty nice houses for $ 300k : - [ horten ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/14/5/628/963/95_610629242_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62896395&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ) - [ hof ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/14/2/629/910/42_944818617_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62991042&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ) - [ vestfossen ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/15/1/599/233/31_1126313755_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62991042&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ), 
  hmm , i should look for a holiday property ... 
   scandinavians left scandinavia because it was so cold and dark nah , we just paid for a one-way ticket for the poorest and landless people to go away  we like the cold and dark . 
  yeah , i get that , but it 's not just that . 
  we have different preferences and building styles . 
  hmm , then again maybe i just do n't like cities in general . 
  those are some pretty neat properties . 
  i think we 've firmly established that all major cities anywhere are expensive , but major tourist destinations like prague even more so , 
  now , i really get why brits emigrate to nz/au . 
  the properties were just fine , but by comparison with flats in and around london ? 
  at least it had a sauna !, 
  also , could it possibly be more uniformly nordic in its design ?!, 
  probably just * one * member of parliament ? 
  what 's neat about that building in your opinion ? 
  needs some work though . 
  i 'm surprised it 's that expensive , but they were nice looking places . 
  yeah , but outside of oslo there 's much more for that price , i 'll copy my reply here : outside of oslo you can get pretty nice houses for that : - [ horten ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/14/5/628/963/95_610629242_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62896395&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ) - [ hof ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/14/2/629/910/42_944818617_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62991042&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ) - [ vestfossen ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/15/1/599/233/31_1126313755_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62991042&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ), 
   they have 40y of mortgage . 
  most people in my country have mortgages , but we 've introduced laws so you must have at least 15 % in cash . 
  young people ca n't buy anything without help from their parents or savings . 
  it 's that cheap still ? 
  it 's a very nice city and area . 
  at first it was really depressing to browse , but i found [ one ] ( http://www.daft.ie/sales/6-camac-view-kilmainham-lane-kilmainham-dublin/1057808/ ) or [ two ] ( http://www.daft.ie/sales/218-castleforbes-sq-block-e-ifsc-dublin/1054813/ ) okay apartments . 
  i 've been to dublin a few times , it 's a nice city , but it seems so murky . 
  frankly , i do n't like the cramped and depressing look of irish and british houses , but i 'm born in fjord country so i 'm used to open spaces and white picket fences . 
   you 'd be surprised how often people confuse the two . 
  is it mostly a problem when talking with brits , europeans or people in general ? 
  outside of oslo you can get pretty nice houses for that : - [ horten ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/14/5/628/963/95_610629242_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62896395&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ) - [ hof ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/14/2/629/910/42_944818617_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62991042&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ) - [ vestfossen ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/15/1/599/233/31_1126313755_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62991042&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ), 
   the boycotting of jews returns to europe hyperbole much ? 
  as a long-time fan of m , his music is religious or at least inspired by it . 
  his songs include `` happy hanukkah '' , `` jerusalem '' , `` king without a crown '' ... 
  yes , very sneaky , but also legal i suspect . 
  the fact that we have that kind of distance between the people and its `` representatives '' in this technological age is baffling !, 
  if the swiss can manage with a direct democracy , i do n't see why the rest of us ca n't . 
   we might annoy the greeks sometimes . 
  for nostalgia 's sake . 
  haha , so honest and true . 
  the greeks do it as well i guess ? 
  the nordic council is even older and still exists . 
  we have a passport union , a former currency union , an attempted defense pact , etc. 
  we would be around the world 's 10th largest economy combined . 
  the idea to reunite has been raised in scandinavian media . 
  actually it was tried before that with [ the nordic council ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/nordisk_vision ) . 
  we did achieve some coherence , but we ended up split over nato and russia during the cold war . 
  we have an existing passport union and had a working currency union already !, 
  we could still make it a work today , we 're all still members and have expanded to the baltics . 
  we would be something like the world 's 10th largest economy i believe . 
  the suggestion to reinvigorate it has been raised in public media lately . 
   it got you all to stop fighting . 
  it 's so important to remember this , it 's why we gave the nobel peace prize to the eu !, 
  yes , that 's the eu in a nutshell . 
  it does n't get enough power to do anything , and all of the members continue arguing . 
  it 's like the us without a real federal government , the states have all the power . 
  there are so many valid arguments for the existing members to keep the status quo : - the power balance , turkey would be a significant player - the income inequality , european unemployment and labor markets - the borders with iraq and syria ( illegal immigration and conflicts ) . 
  turkey 's already a major route . 
  i believe that 's a very valid point . 
  you 're talking about referendums * while * you were a member though ? 
   we speak english ... and * spanish * you 're in for a surprise !, 
  interestingly , `` hull '' means hole in norwegian ... 
   bah , we fired the polish workers it 's not actually a joke . .  my lil ' rumpeslikker !, 
  i wonder if you know the exact meaning ? 
  `` brown-nosing '' , does n't really fit with this context . 
  well , unless you 're an asshole ?
