  bah , we fired the polish workers and relaxed . 
  we 've barely felt the change nationally since we 're not reliant on oil revenue . 
  a few regions have seen unemployment rise . 
  we 've made sure that this scenario would n't play out any other way . 
  it 's why we invested * all * of our oil & gas revenue abroad ; so that we own your companies and real estate . 
  1,25 % of the world 's shares . 
  now , work harder , so that we can demand more profits from our holdings !, 
  :d p.s. 
  oil & gas represented 25 % of our gdp last year . 
   eu should be allowed to fight its own wars . 
  eh , are you joking ? 
  we 're fighting in your wars ... see afghanistan , iraq etc. 
  or are you talking about wwii ? 
  did you check out the dublin link ? 
  we send them back to their original country of registration . 
   not many people go all the way up to norway ? 
  oh , quite a few , the migrants know very well what the conditions are . 
  they prefer germany , sweden and the uk . 
  norway is sort of a second choice over sweden , since they allow all syrians automatic refugee status . 
   you experience the effects of the open border we 're mostly fine with the border with regards to refugees , we 're more annoyed by the thieves/scam artists from the balkans etc. 
  there 's some public frustration about the beggars from romania ( roma people ) , as we do n't have many beggars in need of our own ... 
  they 've also taken to selling drugs , stealing and sleeping in public spaces/land or occupying abandoned homes . 
  the open border has also resulted in visits from pick-pocket gangs , the above mentioned gypsies robbing elderly women on the street , a few rape cases , gangs performing home break-ins , planned business pillaging , etc. 
  a nuisance , but not a major problem . 
  these are mostly eu citizens , and they have to show passports to enter ( as they 're from * non-schengen * countries ) . 
   you experience the effects of the open border/ignore what 's going on in the mediterranean , and you do n't even get to influence the eu to deal with it directly ? 
  yes , it 's something we do feel both directly and indirectly . 
  we have ships in the med helping out with the refugee crisis . 
  we only land them on-shore as per our agreement . 
  there are fewer african migrants in these parts , but i can assure you several of those that have landed have family in norway or scandinavia . 
  they very much wish to get right on the train from milano heading north . 
  we have plenty of somalis and are currently experiencing a rush of eritreans ( military regime ) . 
  we will investigate and treat each case as they apply for asylum . 
  we 're more interested in what we can do to help syrians . 
  we 've decided after much public debate that an * additional * 8000-10000 over the next three years would be our fair share . 
  that 's in addition to those arriving on their own , and in addition to the annual un quota . 
  i checked the primary anti-eu group here and they say it 's primarily about the transfer of power to a central government [ without much accountability ] . 
  the people hardly bother to vote in the eu ( 40 % ) . 
  they also say a lot of decisions are made behind closed doors and ordinary people ca n't keep track of it . 
  on the other hand if i remember correctly the executive ( commission ) is not elected directly , and the council 's role versus the parliament is improvable . 
  the legislative power should be in the hands of the elected representatives and only them . 
   but norway is in schengen , so it 's effectively still your problem ? 
  yes , and no . 
  [ the dublin agreement ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/dublin_regulation ) decides . 
   schengen schengen [ and its information system ] is a separate system from the eu though . 
   norway 's half in half out situation with the eea and eu nope , we 're all-the-way-in [ efta . ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/european_free_trade_association ) . 
  the efta countries have a fta with the eu . 
  we have our own efta court and other mirror institutions . 
  no , no , you 're mistaken , as my country is ** not ** in the eu ... :p see the title of this post , hehe :d, 
   we do n't have any un-documented workers/migrants/refugees on the streets like you see all over , for example , spain , france , italy , and we 'd like to keep it that way . 
  yes , i can understand that . 
  it 's your country and you have every right to decide , but op was breaking a lot of glass by attacking the eu 's policies , hehe . 
   the open boarders ideal is very impractical . 
  now , they do come in ships , but they 're not boarders  seriously , our open borders are just fine ( as opposed to perfect ) . 
  the fact that italy lets them go is * not * a mistake ; they do n't want them to register or stay there . 
  it 's not a weakness in the internal border policing , it 's the external that 's the real challenge . 
  [ frontex ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/frontex ) is the answer , but it 's currently underdeveloped . 
   a lot of aussies do n't see the sense in allowing low skilled immigrants from low waged countries to pop over into britain they do n't even represent a fraction of the skilled eu migrants that enter the uk legally . 
  the free movement of goods , capital , services and people is the eu 's reasons for being . 
  the illegal , low-skilled immigrants attempting to enter the chunnel represent a microscopic amount by comparison . 
  absolutely . 
  ideas and names can gain popularity over time , so much so that we forget their previous names . 
  after all most countries in europe have changed dramatically over the last two-three centuries . 
  oh , i see , you certainly have enough of those , 
  ok , i guess you can be opposed to both . 
  though i do n't see much wrong with the eu itself . 
  the eu simply is n't empowered to do anything , the individual countries just do n't want to deal with it . 
  it 's like blaming the head nurse for striking doctors . 
  thanks for the update !, 
  yes , but i do n't see them as entirely separate . 
  if we shut down the alliance tomorrow , europe would still be able to communicate using european manned and controlled nato resources ? 
   spineless approach to migrants . 
  you did get the glass houses imagery ? 
  at least the eu is n't dumping them on an island ... 
  i mean you have to be opposed to your own country 's policy if you 're so upset by the eu 's way of doing things . 
  at least they 're giving them residency and permission to walk around freely . 
   due to its undemocratic nature and spineless approach to migrants . 
  haha , the glass must be raining down on you !, 
  want another rock ? 
   it 's a true union where members are expected to work together willingly . 
  yes , but also unwilling [ for good reasons ] to sacrifice their national interests on the altar of the common good . 
  except for the existing european nato command structure we do have ? 
  even france is in the nato command structure these days , 
  you missed your chance to use `` defenestrated '' !, 
  apparently , [ according to the israeli leader we work against them ... ] ( http://www.thelocal.no/20150313/scandinavia-accused-of-meddling-in-israel-vote ), 
  you know that benjamin netanyahu claimed that scandinavian governments were conspiring against him during the most recent elections , right ? 
  i think that was op 's point about puerto rico . 
  you asked , 
   recently its been very incompetent when it comes to big issues that 's because it does n't have the mandate or power to act . 
  they 're bankrupt and the us refused to bail them out recently . 
  the eu does have its common defence policy , the weu-nato relationship and the eu 's battlegroups . 
  - this is why [ the eu is training somali forces in kenya ( eutm ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udepdiperqe ) . 
  - [ eu navies are working to combat piracy in waters off somalia ( eu navfor ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgk-zmsylko ), 
   additionally there does n't seem to be any sort of unified military structure , even for defensive conflicts you 're wrong on that account . 
  please , see the [ western european union ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/western_european_union ) and the current eu 's [ common security and defence policy ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/common_security_and_defence_policy ) [ the eu battlegroups ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/eu_battlegroup ) is a manifestation of this . 
  - `` at the 1996 nato ministerial meeting in berlin , it was agreed that the western european union ( weu ) would oversee the creation of a european security and defence identity within nato structures . 
  the esdi was to create a european ` pillar ' within nato , partly to allow european countries to act militarily where nato wished not to , and partly to alleviate the united states ' financial burden of maintaining military bases in europe , which it had done since the cold war . 
  the berlin agreement allowed european countries ( through the weu ) to use nato assets if it so wished ( this agreement was later amended to allow the european union to conduct such missions , the so-called berlin-plus arrangement ) . '', 
   the country has fuck all to gain from it .
