  the same goes for the us , but you 're not going to claim everyone is treated equally there either . 
   different perspectives is all . 
  one can become a citizen of norway , but not considered norwegian because of ethnicity . 
  on the other hand , one can become a citizen of america , and be considered an american regardless of ethnicity . 
  absolutely . 
  that 's why we operate with two terms for norwegians . 
  one is for ethnic norwegian , the other is for norwegian citizen . 
  however , we 're a nation , a people , not just a state . 
  to compare us is like comparing the us population to native american tribes . 
  we 're not racist/exclusionary because we 're also a ethnic group , 
  hehe , yeah , i 've heard the same . 
  however i would guess that most have german or mixed backgrounds . 
  i mean you ca n't avoid it with the huge percentage of german-americans in the us . 
  was it 60 % at one point [ for the european-american population ] ? 
  it was ddr 's greatest export hit  sorry , that i linked to the norwegian audio version , i just did n't remember what the original was called a first . 
  basically a celebration of american culture and their iconic cars . 
  they love their veteran cars , but also newer cars . 
  there are few modern american made cars in norway today . 
  i 'm not counting german made fords or opels . 
  there are places that celebrate the 1950s diners , by literally recreating them , and people who like to dress up . 
  some are reliving their youth , others just like the retro style . 
  it 's a subculture . 
   it 's more of a german connection well , the house is `` german '' originally , the family in question was danish . 
  they spoke danish and had their family reunions in denmark ... 
  please , note that parts of denmark were taken by germany . 
  take , nicholas ii of russia , czar during wwi , was related to several monarchs in europe . 
  `` his mother 's siblings included the kings of denmark and greece as well as the united kingdom 's queen alexandra . 
  nicholas , his wife , alexandra , and kaiser wilhelm ii of germany were all first cousins of king george v of the united kingdom . '', 
  `` while not first cousins , nicholas and kaiser wilhelm ii were second cousins , once removed , as well as third cousins , as they were both great-great-grandsons of tsar paul i of russia . '', 
  `` in his childhood , nicholas , his parents and siblings made annual visits to the danish royal palaces of fredensborg and bernstorff to visit his grandparents , the king and queen . 
  the visits also served as family reunions , as his mother 's siblings would also come from england , germany and greece with their respective families . '', 
  having traveled around hungary , austria , serbia and romania - i 'm slightly confused by that statement ? 
  everyone here knows you lost territory to your neighbors , and the controversial citizenship laws . . you literally have to have a lot in common with them , 
   they were very quick to abandon their language yeah , i believe that applies to most europeans around that time , however norwegians did keep it alive using schools , colleges , churches and newspapers . 
  on the other hand german ( non-jewish ) was one of the major languages of the us at the time . 
  today , norwegian-americans can [ send their children to norwegian culture and language camp in minnesota . 
   not sure if you 're trying to be condescending or make a point here . 
  well , just making a point about how hyped it was . 
  it was all over the news that `` we 'll show him '' , auf is stronger than ever . 
  perhaps you simply overwrote that with the voter information ? 
  you forgot : [ sandm\u00e4nnchen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5e2lutnumg ) [ la linea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmlzljlotte ), 
  except , he used to play wow and lots of cod etc. 
  he used fps games to desensitize himself to killing . 
  he said the actual murders was like a game , but he was also high on stimulants and music . 
   and there 's been no `` ut\u00f8ya-effect '' with new youths coming to the labour party . 
  wrong . 
  do you even * remember * 2011 ? 
  do you follow german politics ? 
   ap got the majority of votes the last election . 
  they were the largest party , but only by a few percentage points . 
  the socialists and conservatives are blocks , it makes little sense to speak of them as as separate . 
  [ the center-right block won the * majority * of the votes . 
  these young people do n't all stay the same , you know ? 
  i 'm on the opposite side politically , but i know many adults today that used to be in that camp . 
  some of them changed their minds and joined other parties . 
  some of them simply ignored politics for the rest of their lives . 
  it 's not an indoctrination camp , but i get your comparison to christian camps . 
  those camps have very different goals . 
  well , we can just tell them to look at hungary ... to make sure they know the value of a * serious * and well developed political culture !, 
  that will scare the fuck of out them !, 
  except he crystallized the survivors , those not present , the younger and older , and let 's not forget the enormous amount of * new * recruits who joined in response !, 
  we also offer 16 year olds voting rights , in selected regions , as part of a trial run . 
  we now offer * 16 year olds * voting rights in parts of norway ... 
  this year 's elections in fact . 
  we 've given ** 16 ** years old voting rights in some districts here in norway . 
  it 's a trial . 
  yeah , we do n't actually release people like him . 
  he 's serving 21 years , which can and will be extended for an unlimited amount of additional 5 year periods ... for life . 
  they 've been making a real effort lately since they do n't want to make putin 's `` you 're russian '' argument for him ...

  you feel more * culturally * connected to australia than your neighbors ? 
  have you ever been to israel ? 
  culturally i would n't compare the two . 
  hehe , yes , in a sense . 
  it was the real game of thrones , `` brother '' against `` brother '' . 
  the family members reunited in denmark for family gatherings . 
  - the last czar 's wife was [ reburied in russia just a few years ago . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1529960/body-of-last-tsars-mother-brought-back-to-russia.html ) [ nicholas ii of russia ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/nicholas_ii_of_russia ) , czar during wwi , was related to several monarchs in europe . 
  his mother 's siblings included the kings of denmark and greece as well as the united kingdom 's queen alexandra . 
  nicholas , his wife , alexandra , and kaiser wilhelm ii of germany were all first cousins of king george v of the united kingdom . 
  nicholas was also a first cousin of both king haakon vii and queen maud of norway , as well as king constantine i of greece . 
  while not first cousins , nicholas and kaiser wilhelm ii were ** second ** cousins , once removed , as each descended from king frederick william iii of prussia , as well as third cousins , as they were both great-great-grandsons of tsar paul i of russia . 
  in his childhood , nicholas , his parents and siblings made annual visits to the danish royal palaces of fredensborg and bernstorff to visit his grandparents , the king and queen . 
  the visits also served as family reunions , as his mother 's siblings would also come from england , germany and greece with their respective families . 
   i will always be an outsider and an immigrant , and i will never be accepted as being a part of the local nationality . 
  now , i really wonder where you live and originated . 
  you 're not wrong either , as we 're * nations * , not just states . 
  i would claim you ca n't join a * nation * ( as it 's basically tribal/ethnic ) . 
  you can become a citizen here without any issues , but never become norwegian ( which is why we use two different terms for citizens and natives ) . 
   other americans will recognise you as such . 
  this may be slightly more idealized than reality . 
   denmark seems very similar too even though i ca n't understand much of its language . 
  you 're very similar , nobody understands either of you , 
  aww , that 's both sad and honest ? 
  that 's the * danish * connection . 
  the danish royal family spread far and wide , there 's a reason their father was called the father-in-law of europe . 
  [ my answer is here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g2he4/which_country_do_you_feel_culturally_the_most/ctulw8c ), 
  while i do n't think it 's in the same league or class as our relationship with denmark [ or even sweden ] it 's not entirely wrong . 
  we have a fondness for the us , especially after wwii , we used to be german focused .
