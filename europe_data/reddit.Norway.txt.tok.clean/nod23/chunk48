  it 's particularly noticeable in the older generation , who had even greater reasons to admire the us . 
  however , today there are many amcar clubs and such . 
  norwegian girls are cheerleading champions . 
  lots of norwegians go on holiday in the us every year . 
  the us , australia and the uk is where we study abroad . 
  our constitution was modeled on the american and french . 
  there are millions of norwegian-americans in the us . 
  we like to stay in touch and to maintain our bonds . 
  if some non-scandinavian should read this ; our police does not publish the names or photos of criminals in general . 
   disturbance of public order etc. 
  we do have a similar law , it carries a maximum penalty of six months . 
  i 'm not sure if it would be applied to this case . 
  we have strict measures against the use of force , as in forced medical treatment , so other laws may be more appropriate in order for him to get help . 
  wasting police resources and such is secondary . 
  well , they ca n't prosecute him for attempted suicide either , even if they * wished * to label it as such [ for lack of a better alternative ] . 
  yeah , they did actually this week . 
  `` 12 [ young ] asylum seekers detained after barricading themselves in a gym and throwing rocks at the police ... '' apparently they did n't want one of the * non-underage * immigrants to be moved to an adult facility where he belonged . 
  i feel this is almost non-news , or at least not european news . 
  empty threats that they make all of the time . 
  yeah , it is quite similar in norway . 
  no turkish neighborhoods . 
  your whole comment makes me seriously question immigration in general . 
  very sad . 
   dschinghis khan found the german , 
  where did this happen ? 
  was the mother another shopper ? 
  it ca n't be croatia since you `` get lumped in with the polish '' , right ? 
  it 's probably way easier to surprise germans abroad then . 
  you 'll get your shot !, 
  haha , yes , that fits !, 
  it was budapest in the fall . 
  i noticed a large group of boys and girls speaking spanish roaming v\u00e1ci utca at night . 
  they were fascinated by some erotic club . 
  i guessed they were mexicans based on language/appearance , thanks for confirming it !, 
  i knew just from reading about it online ... 
  i 've also had dutch co-workers , but they 've never mentioned it . 
  though , [ we like to make fun of dutch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qustqr9czdq ) [ since it sounds so ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzfbue32dba ) [ much like our own language ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7pv0toywy8 ) . 
  well , i knew those reasons for why it would work , so i suppose a swede might as well . 
  you never know with swedes , 
  ah , i 'll have to be on the lookout for more easter eggs like your own , 
  i 've met a group of young mexicans in hungary , i thought it was slightly weird . 
  is it part of some sort of exchange program ? 
  fair point , 
  hmm , i 'm not sure if you just do n't like the joke or something else ? 
  hmm , i ca n't tell if that 's sarcastic mocking of flemish , walloons or belgians in general ? 
  all of the places where scandinavian students are represented the locals/students know we 're freaky and really `` active '' ... at us and european universities , i 've heard the same thing . 
  oh , you , [ do n't you know argentinians are white ? 
  ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/792/329/4c2.png ), 
  you win this thread !, 
  now , that sounds like a long con . 
  you obviously have some experience teaching/tricking these students , have you done this for many years ? 
  haha , i did n't notice it was `` rose petals '' he wrote , in my mind it was rose water we were talking about . 
  amusing how the mind smooths over that kind of error . 
  now , i see your comment in a new and more humorous light !, 
  ah , thanks , how did you know ? 
  typical americans always going for the violent option when sex would be much more interesting  why not `` it sounds like you could still speak normally if someone had their genitals in your mouth . 
  `` irish '' is the * official * name for what you may know as gaelic or irish gaelic . 
  hungarian women are known for bathing in other liquids ( see [ countess b\u00e1thory ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/elizabeth_b%c3%a1thory ) ) turns out bathing in blood apparently does work , i ca n't find the source but there was some news item about it having a positive effect . 
  in english : hungarikum ( [ hung\u0252\u027eikum ] ) is a term of hungarian origin designating a set of tangible and intangible objects constituting the dominant representation and reputation of hungary worldwide . 
  this is a tourism concept that emphasizes the typical character of hungarian culture by promoting specific products . 
  tell us more about these parts ... for science , 
  yes , but why are you fluent in afrikaans though ? 
  yes , yes , you can stop arguing with me . 
  neither of us are on the committee in question . 
  i tried to impart some knowledge of the committee 's views , only to be met with hostility from many and ridicule from the likes of you . 
  reddit is great . 
   i just showed you how silly it can get you made a ridiculous example that had nothing to do with the point i was making . 
  it does not reflect the serious considerations the committe does . 
  / ignore, 
  sorry , i have no interest in wasting more time on people like you and others here . 
  it was written in norwegian and english somewhere , so you can easily search for it yourself . 
   so different prizes have different rules ? 
  yes , the prizes have different mandates ; heck , some of them were n't even in the original will . 
  there are two committes ( sweden and norway ) . 
  as with laws , they need to be interpreted and * adapted * to fit with new knowledge and the age we live in . 
  that 's how laws work in the scandinavian legal systems . 
  a swedish person [ do n't remember who ] recently tried taking it to court , since he did n't believe the norwegian committees ' views were in line with the will , [ i believe ] he lost the case . 
  actually , that 's not a bad rationale , but that would be a science award more than peace prize material . 
  if the water being shared was a source of conflict , like the nile is , and the person in question agreed to share it ... 
  you know that a silly person from your country took it to court and lost ? 
  they are in fact not breaking the rules of the trust . 
  ok , nice map , but it would be great if you could include [ all of norway next time . 
  where does the map come from ? 
  the language is sami , not `` lapp '' which is sometimes pejorative . 
  it 's also gives the wrong impression , it 's not a majority language in that region - it 's one of two . 
  the same goes for scandinavia and sami . 
  this is the norwegian nobel committees own expressed opinion on the matter , even if it 's not verbatim . 
  they 've gone further than they previously did , for example with wangari maathai ( environmental ) , because they look at the bigger picture . 
   you do n't reward someone to encourage them to work towards peace , you reward them for their actions towards that goal . 
  they 're doing both . 
  obviously kim jung-un wo n't win any time soon , but a man that works for peace could be given more `` help '' in the eyes of the committee . 
  he must obviously be deserving , but it 's not only about having accomplished something - that 's why people fail to understand obama 's prize . 
  having said that he would bring an end to the wars was certainly worth promoting . 
   the peace price is almost a joke this is obviously based on misconceptions . 
  there is much more to the prizes than you imagine . 
  it 's not about the past , it 's about encouraging and creating peace in the future . 
  the prize is designed to help , open doors and push the recipient forwards ( support , a moral obligation ) . 
  i hope you do n't believe that though ? 
   the peace prize has a clear left-wing slant these days uh , do you have any idea who hands out the prize ? 
   it became more about making a statement than to reward someone for their achievements sadly it 's what the prize is designed to do .
