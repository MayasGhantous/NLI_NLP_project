  it 's supposed to help bring about peace , by encouraging people and factors for peace . 
  the prize has a long-term outlook and is n't about rewarding past successes !, 
   kissinger , arafat and obama you misunderstand why they were given the awards ... 
   the peace prize has become a farce . 
  sorry to hear you say that , but it 's based on misunderstandings . 
   then they gave it malala yousafzai - but there is people that deserve it so much more . 
  again you misunderstand what the prize is about . 
  it 's a question of promoting peace ; education for women is an * established * factor for peace . 
  it 's probably the region of the world that needs it the most !, 
   giving it to barack obama before he even did anything this is a common misunderstanding . 
  the prize is n't always for the reasons * you * imagine . 
  it 's not a prize for having brought peace after the fact , it 's a prize for those who do something to * promote * it !, 
  in barack obama 's case it was awarded for america 's democracy having overcome their racist history and segregation . 
  it was essentially an award for the us !, 
  a positive step for peace and progress in the us and the world . 
  - as we 've seen since the african-american population is still suffering discrimination , if it 's not handled properly it could lead to more violence and conflicts . 
  now , the * second * part of the reasoning was norway 's soft power intentions behind the choice . 
  it was a clear goal for the norwegian nobel committee that obama would be given both the status to `` open doors '' and to ** compel ** him to continue down the path that would bring about an end to the current wars . 
  the prize does n't always push people in the right direction , just look at previous conflicts ; the israeli , palestinian and soviet winners were being rewarded for efforts that ultimately failed - but the efforts were made . 
  that 's what counts . 
  this is a * long , long-term * prize that will ultimately be judged on how and what the laureates did centuries from now . 
  did you make this map ? 
  it does n't for norway . 
  that 's why we introduced conscription for women as well . 
  this is common in the nordic countries . 
  sure , we 're all joking anyway . 
  though after the roman empire fell it did decay . 
  it probably varied widely , from your end to other areas . 
   portuguese people focus quite a lot on hygiene , in part thanks to arabic influence . 
  yeah , they invaded your region after 711 , the viking age was at its peak during the 800-1066 . 
  i imagine it took some time for your `` inheritance '' to manifest . 
  we still `` outwash '' you by several centuries , hehe , 
  haha , you other europeans did n't wash at all !, 
  sorry , i do n't know * that * much about merkel . 
   why not some other person from that party the party does decide that , internally , and often with opposing candidates from separate wings . 
  guess who has the most power within the cdu ? 
  democracy is wonderful !, 
  her husband has two sons . 
  a hundred years ago labor and conservative voters [ in norway ] were entirely separate groups and classes of people . 
  today , a voter might easily choose to vote for either party . 
  the centrist wing of the conservative party and the moderate wing of labor [ in norway ] can come to agreement on most things . 
  if you ask me scandinavia and norway in particular has pretty much been led by one party in particular ( labor ) . 
  every now and then the government has changed hands , but not for too long . 
  the general consensus and direction has always been forwards , with a slight variation on the same themes . 
  hehe , it would certainly make us feel warm at first , 
  by their ** own ** [ turkish ] military ? 
  i think not !, 
  hehe , fair is fair . 
  [ yeah , it was just al-qaeda they were accused of supplying weapons . 
  ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/01/turkey-syria-intelligence-service-shipping-weapons.html# ), 
   france rejoined nato they never left nato itself , they left/re-joined the unified * command * structure . 
  germany has nukes , carried by german planes . 
  they 're just partially under german control though . 
  it 's part of the nato sharing program . 
  i do n't know if gibraltar really counts towards `` continental '' though  the deal you get will probably be on the eu 's terms . 
  you might be none of the above soon , 
  yeah , it 's the plural of cheeses ( ost - er ) . 
  i 'll go ahead and assume you know it 's actually \u00d6sterreich though  \u00d8 is equivalent to \u00d6 . 
  yes , yes , if you do n't want to get my teasing , do n't . 
  no , no , * \u00f8st * is east , ost is cheese . 
  at least we 're true to the germanic original , you guys are just victims of the roman empire !, 
  you say that as if it 's something * positive * ? 
  no , it smells of politically correct censorship , * in my opinion * . 
  should we disqualify all countries with extra-european territories ? 
   at least with regards to russia it 's the same contiguous country . 
  the kingdom of denmark has territory in north america ; i.e. 
  norway has islands in the arctic and near antarctica . 
  spain has territory in and off africa . 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  yeah , but it 's more a question of value . 
  nothing 's free in germany because it 's all desirable . 
  that 's because germany 's [ land ] is worth something ... 
  ** norway ** we 're on holiday . 
  everyone . 
    because i had behaved in good manners in a swedish context . 
   have you considered that it may have been you that caused any misunderstandings clearly he did . 
  he would know their manners better than you . 
  i would set the line using a measure of acceptance ; what you accept of your host country 's culture . 
  recognizing that your home country 's values are not going to be respected or enforced . 
  demanding that the natives follow them , or exempting yourself from theirs , is crossing the line . 
  clearly most europeans will only be satisfied with * assimilation * , or at least partially so . 
  when in rome ... 
  yes , thank you , that 's exactly what i was referring to . 
  hilarious , butt hurt greeks downvote a * factual * statement . 
   so why not act like a `` union '' , and do something that actually helps greece get out of this hole ? 
  my country is * not * in the union . 
  the imf is not part of the union . 
   i 'm not in europe , so this does n't really effect me . 
  oh , it effects us all alright !, 
  the us economy and dollar also feels the effect of the eurozone woes . 
  it 's a global economy . 
  do you know who finances the imf ? 
  according to what greek people have told me here , the imf should tell them to ** f \\*\\* k off ** ; because you 're obviously stupid if you lend money to the greeks when you know they ca n't afford to pay it back . 
  tl ; dr do n't lend money to the greeks . 
  ever . 
  you do n't get to choose if the government acts on your behalf ... it does n't work that way in any democracy i know of . 
  how would governments run any country that way ? 
  an extreme version of the swiss direct democracy ? 
  i suppose if you 're a very optimistic anti-capitalist , communist-or-similar you might dream of a world without capitalism , banks and debts . 
  until that happens we 'll all have to live with it .
