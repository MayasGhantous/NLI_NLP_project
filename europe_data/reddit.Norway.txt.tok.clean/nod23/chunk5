   eu is weak , cause it really really wants to act like a one big country , which is not . 
  yes , maybe in the future though . 
  the eu 's battlegroups is supposed to fill the void . 
  sorry , i do n't have time to read it all , was there any mention of a security pact there ? 
  the eu member sweden has never been to iraq . 
  does that make up for the uk 's mistake ? 
  has * the eu * really promised protection ? 
  when ? 
  you mean the * french * gift to the us is n't european enough ? 
  peace is noble ? 
  yeah , you really should , 
   norway - state owned , superb quality , free of charge in most places . 
  i think you 're extrapolating from your own experience . 
  water is * publically * owned , but by the municipality or county . 
  it 's usually far from free , but at very reasonable prices ( metered/fixed price ) . 
   how does that work ? 
  it 's not free in all of norway , it varies from municipality to municipality . 
  it 's frequently metered now or you pay a fixed amount per household size . 
  it 's a very small amount per 1m \u00b3 most places i 've lived in norway . 
   should n't you have at least make people pay a very small fee to limit waste ? 
  yes , and we do . 
  norway has huge water resources that get replenished every year ( see melting snow on the mountains , huge lakes and rivers ) . 
  we export water . 
  i will agree that it 's a tasty dish , even if it 's more of a dessert , 
  hehe , i thought not . 
  i 'll still have some !, 
  i would suggest some [ excellent fish dishes ] ( http://www.godfisk.no/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/b2c/oppskrifter/norge/stekt-laks-med-parmesan/39214-2-nor-no/stekt-laks-med-parmesan_large.jpg ) , maybe [ some lamb ] ( http://www.visitnorway.com/imagevaultfiles/id_7773/cf_1174/lamb-dish-foodprints-norway-740.jpg ) or even [ king crab ] ( http://www.norway-travel.com/upload/king_crab_safari-nordkyn_hotel.jpg ) . 
  does that come with a side of fresh reality ? 
  do you serve it on plates of cold truth ? 
  i think your dish needs some salt ... 
  thanks , that 's what i thought . 
  it does n't sound that different from norway . 
  our cities also have district heating . 
  the huge , new garbage burning plants are competing with sweden for the trash ... homes outside of the cities normally use electricity and wood , maybe a few still have oil heaters . 
  everyone has some sort of air-source heat pump here as well . 
   homes are not heated with electricity , unlike nearly all of europe and the other scandanavian countries . 
  what exactly do you mean by this ? 
  bah , that 's just an excuse . 
  we have more sound policies than you guys ; we save more than we spend . 
  that oil money is just invested abroad . 
  you also have oil and gas in denmark . 
  [ dong ] ( http://www.dongenergy.com/en/pages/index.aspx ) exists for a reason . 
   fried bread with cheese . 
  oh , god !, 
  yes , please !, 
  it was my first meeting with lithuanian cuisine . 
  yes , please , go ahead . 
  it will make things more interesting for us . 
   yeah , tax reform in greece has nothing to do with the troika . 
  lol if you disregard the reforms . 
  it was like that * prior * to the trokia , was it not ? 
  which was my point . 
   careless reader yes , you 're right . 
  i do n't really care about greece :p  it 's the troika that seems not to be aware of that . 
  or are they ? . 
  you mean they should expect greece to fail , or treat them like an equal ? 
  it 's logical to take it into account , but it seems like a problem they should be able to tackle ( enforcement ) . 
  older and unskilled workers , from for example spain , that have come to my country have been featured in the major newspapers . 
  they 're desperate and come filled with lots of hope , thinking jobs are plentiful and easy to get . 
  only to find misery and no interest at all , especially for people who do n't even speak english . 
  our system requires legal status , proper papers and native language skills . 
  they end up begging at the catholic charity , that caters almost exclusively to foreigners and illegal immigrants . 
  most leave again quickly , or freeze on the streets at night . 
  a lot of young greeks , spanish and other southern europeans have moved to countries such as germany [ and even my country ] . 
  the other eu countries are actually benefitting by getting well educated and highly valuable human resources at a discount . 
  this will no doubt hurt greece in the coming decades , as they 've `` lost '' a generation that would have added to their gdp and carried the pension burden . 
  this is the greek tax system , in general , not something created by the imf or eu ... 
  yes , but that 's the second and other stereotype i know certain european peoples have when it comes to germans . 
  yeah , but compund words that describe a cultural * concept * . 
  restroom keyrings do n't really apply . 
  i believe that may be more relatable , as to `` fika '' is more of a matter of general , everyday enjoyment . 
  fika does n't exist in my country , as such , and in norwegian it means to * slap-someone-in-the-face * ( past tense ) , hehe . 
  language conveys most of the meaning , but there 's something about shared human experiences . 
  mass hysteria and all that . 
  it 's just not the same if you 're not familiar with the celebration . 
  i believe it can be learned , but it 's not something you pick up by reading alone . 
  it 's like going to a college football game , it 's friday nights right ? 
  say you 're a recent arrival in town ; a foreign , cricket fan . 
  it 's not going to affect you in exactly the same way , when your town wins over its rival - and it 's your and the neighbor 's son playing . 
  that shared community feeling and joy , 
   cultural differences like that are minor i believe that 's only true when interpreted from afar . 
  maryland and scandinavia for example , are very different in many ways . 
  this may not be the biggest difference ( utepils ) , but our winters are quite different from yours . 
  while we 're all humans and capable of the same experiences , i doubt you will ever fully understand the relief and joy of this season opening [ and it 's continued expression ] without having lived here a few winters and summers , 
  sounds like a party is * brewing * , 
  actually , i think we use both , it was a `` hyggelig '' evening etc. 
  i 'm in southern norway , so it may vary . 
  here 's an outsider 's view : http://afroginthefjord.com/2014/02/02/how-to-make-things-koselig/, 
  hehe . 
  yeah , it was great here as well . 
  very unusual for us , but up until that point it had been a very bad year weatherwise . 
  according to my irish friends that * one * day a year when it 's summer ? 
  yeah ? 
  except it 's * not * just about sitting outside  here 's my full description : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2a6420/found_in_translation_european_languages_words_not/cis0szs, 
  beerenburg ? 
  i 've never tried that before . 
  fine , i 'm sure we 'll get along just fine :d, 
  i believe we adopted that * as is * in certain norwegian dialects , but it 's gone out of use . 
  lots of dutch-norwegian exchange due to a history of maritime trade . 
  it 's supposedly not that hard , for those who have ancestry there .
