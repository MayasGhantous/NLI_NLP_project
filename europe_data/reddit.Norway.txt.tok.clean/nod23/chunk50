  i certainly expect no mercy if my country fails to pay its debt in the future . 
  i doubt any greek creditors would be less demanding . 
  greece is already ruined , in every possible way ; by past and current generations , by the previous governments , by the current government , and by the eu/ez/ecb and imf . 
   ok , you clearly have no idea of what is going on ... bah , the arguments of a man who 's run out of arguments . 
   the people have nothing to do with these loans , they did not take , agree or want them and they did not benefit from them either now , that 's a common argument written by someone with no idea how things work . 
  i 'm a man of the law , i care deeply about it . 
  the gov ' t of any country acts on behalf of its people . 
  i can understand arguments about dictators ' debts , but not money lent recently !, 
  the eu should probably accept some reductions based on ability . 
   and now we have to cut back even more ? 
  yes . 
   there is nothing to cut back on !, 
  there is plenty to do still . 
  it 's not always about reducing the budget , but also about market legislation and selling off assets . 
   while the big bucks stay out of harms way yes , naturally , that 's the way things work . 
  ca n't say i blame you for that sentiment though . 
  the world is unfair and no protest in greece [ or elsewhere ] will change that . 
   why the people are so pissed they 're pissed because they do n't like it . 
  that does n't mean they have good [ legal or moral ] reasons for rejecting deals and debts . 
   greece did not slap in the face every popular `` oxi '' protest is exactly that , in my view . 
  the political leadership of greece can never ever expect their population to support any debt payments . 
  the masses are like irresponsible children in any and every country . 
  the people have their own simple view of the world ; `` it 's your fault for borrowing us money , we should n't have to pay it back , etc '' . 
  no greek government will ever become credible with that kind of attitude , and as such they should never be allowed to lend again . 
  now , * that * would truly destroy greece !, 
   but what we seemingly cant do , is what is required to solve the issue ... 
  they 're playing hardball in europe , it will be solved by a debt reduction and hard reforms in greece . 
  both side will suffer deeply , but of course the greek people will suffer the most . 
  that 's just natural . 
   you lended money to someone who can not repay and now you are suprised ? 
  no , it 's a question of honesty . 
  if i let you borrow to feed your family , i expect you to honor that intention by attempting and agreeing to pay it back . 
  trying . 
  the greeks are refusing . 
   help ? 
  in the form of more loans that they can never repay ? 
  that 's not helping , it 's kicking a dog while it 's down . 
  yes , help that keeps their government paying salaries etc. 
  i 'd love to hear how you would solve that . 
  the money they desperately need to keep their banks and savings afloat . 
  that 's our money doing that . 
   help would be to repay them what they did to us after ww2 , uh , germany is not the only lender . 
  europe and the world are . 
  my country also gave greece loans , we do n't owe them shit . 
  the real slap in the face is not repaying what you needed to feed your family yesterday . 
  we did n't have to lend them anything . 
   the government there yeah , but that was my point , only in that one piece of libya . 
  as you know there is n't just one government in libya . 
   last news was that everybody but the tripoli based group was on board with the peace deal . 
  yeah , i do n't believe that will last . 
  it will fall apart since there is so little that keeps them bonded together ( no nation ) , so much that divides them ( tribalism ) , and the greedy can keep what they control for their own . 
   breaking the country up if they want to stick together they 'll find a way . 
  i just think it 's more likely they 'll want to keep [ more than ] their fair share of the resources . 
  there will be losers . 
  so that 's why [ they ca n't speak properly !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ) itt : the few danes that lack humor ... 
   i have a feeling all sides deliberately allow the boats to go through as a form of leverage towards europe . 
  they did under the former leadership . 
  however , today they do n't control more than their own little zone . 
  the fighting is regional and tribal . 
  these groups simply profit from the human trafficking . 
  i do n't believe they see this in the macro perspective , it 's about financing their own groups . 
   there are peace talks too , these are completely unlikely to succeed in my opinion . 
  there are too many groups who are mutually exclusive and want more for their own . 
  the resources will not be equally split . 
  libya * was * three countries and i believe it will be again . 
  the extremists who fight for is at home and abroad are n't looking to share power . 
  yes , i did n't address that , but it may be different people than you would normally see ? 
  rural versus urban etc. 
  the ratio of smuggled versus legal is probably much higher in the border regions [ or less wealthy regions ] . 
   maybe it 's because in poland they banned smoking or because they smoke smuggled cigarettes from belarus/russia . 
  hmm , denmark has a lot of farmers ? 
   in exchange for their natural resources , we would provide education , health , infrastructure , utilities etc. 
  are you china ? 
  how 's the us african colony doing today ? 
  liberia , was it ? 
   fix libya . 
  as soon as libya is fixed , it can start patrolling its coasts again , and we can return all boats we find to the shores of libya . 
  i do n't believe we can fix libya . 
  maybe we could fix one of the three libyan regions . 
   the refugees : the refugees are n't coming to europe to destroy us . 
  they are fleeing wars . 
  yes , the syrians are , many africans are fleeing regimes and/or are economic migrants . 
  the first i can accept , the second i wo n't . 
  we 're not the land of economic opportunity for poor , uneducated people ( legal/illegal ) . 
  that 's what the eu court is for ; determining what is in conflict with the treaties . 
  in particular the free and unburdened trade across the internal borders of the eu 's inner market . 
  `` the ~ ~ spice ~ ~ money must flow ! '', 
  hehe , right , this only applies to european markets . 
  you 're ignoring their conduct while they 're still getting emergency help from europe . 
  why do n't you go do something about your own country 's industrial animal farming ? 
  start at home !,

  it 's a reinforcing loop . 
  i do n't care which side started it . 
   any bank which does business or has interests in the us ... which is pretty much all banks . 
  that 's sort of what we 've been talking about , there are banks that do n't have that for those exact reasons ; no us business or interests at all . 
   no bank is going to risk a large scale investigation and possible disbarment from the us for a little country like iran , what you do n't seem to want to admit is that not everyone cares about the us market . 
  every big multi-national obviously does , but not every company or bank is that .
