   underestimate the importance of the us dollar and banking system there you go talking about the us dollar as if it was controlled by the us gov ' t or banks . 
  i can buy dollars on the open market from anyone , no american control or regulation whatsoever . 
  the us banking system is a critical component in the global economy . 
  as i said in earlier comments , it 's not the only market in the world and some banks do n't go there for various reasons . 
   very shrewd/very bad at maths to think its a good idea to launder oil for dollars it 's * risky * business , but with high rewards !, 
  that 's exactly why some do it . 
  cleary , they need to avoid us exposure , but the us does n't control the world , so there will be places where they can do their business . 
  it does when it 's reported , criminal in nature and proven in court . 
  the [ swedish ] article mentions another similar offender that was arrested [ for harassing two homosexual muslim men ] and may be denied and deported . 
  yes , but mostly he 's full of himself . 
  oh , yeah , one of the greatest sources of muslim hatred , israeli actions , is entirely irrelevant ... 
  [ friesland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/frisian_flag.svg/640px-frisian_flag.svg.png ) is probably opposed . 
  - `` the seven red seeblatts ( or pompebl\u00eaden , as they are called in frisian ) are a reference to the frisian `` sea countries '' in the middle ages : independent regions along the coast from alkmaar to the weser who were ** allied against the vikings ** . '', 
  however , recently [ they created this unofficial flag for the `` all frisian '' culture ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/all_frisian_flag_scandinavial_model.svg/500px-all_frisian_flag_scandinavial_model.svg.png ) , maybe they do want to join us now ? 
  yes , yes , you guys are * missing the point * . 
  i know they 're related , that 's why i used it as an example !, 
  it 's not the same language today . 
  which is the point of the discussion above . 
  i 'm afraid i left that point without much context and should have elaborated . 
  i was rather thinking about the whole package ; not just the ethnic groups i referred to . 
   why are jews not european ? 
  as a person of ashkenazi background , i would say it depends on more than * just * the person 's ethnic background . 
  israelis in general are not europeans , mostly because they are culturally distinct from us . 
  many have strong ties to europe , but that does n't make them `` european '' , any more than the americans are . 
  - not all israeli jews are european ethnic . 
  there are several major jewish groups including the mizrahi and sephardim . 
  the political culture and religious nature of israeli society is far from typically european . 
  the `` siege '' mentality is hard to understand . 
  can you imagine the unique role of the haredim in a european society ? 
  the american influence on politics is quite clear , for good reasons obviously what with the american emigrants and support . 
   brits do n't consider themselves european `` schr\u00f6dinger 's brit '', 
  hmm , associated with and involved with european organizations/groups does n't make the country itself very european . 
  the population is clearly not , arabs , jews etc. 
  works better in norwegian where it 's the `` smell '' , 
  that 's lebanon . 
  are you sure , those fancy melons are expensive . 
   yeah , kinda . 
  yeah , there we go with that kind of accuracy again , hehe  it 's the `` kinda '' i 'm complaining about . 
  they 're related , sure , but they 're obviously not mere dialects today . 
  they are different languages . 
   98 % of the words are the exact same words that is not actually true or at least imprecise . 
  we share many words , but many have now changed meaning or become archaic . 
  in practice their usage and syntax is often completely different from ours . 
  a simple and common response , a mere sentence , would be quite distinct in either language . 
  i worked a number of years for a danish company here in norway . 
  all of my coworkers were danish , or from jutland ( joke ) . 
  i currently work in a mixed-scandinavian , int ' l corporation . 
  the danes can obviously understand much of what we write , but the * accuracy * is not high or perfect . 
  the same goes for norwegians and danish . 
   just pronounced a bit differently . 
  just a bit you say ?!!!, 
  i 'll leave this since we 're talking about written norms ( bokm\u00e5l ) . 
  there 's a reason some danes think we speak swedish at first [ or do n't understand at all ] . 
   anyone who says they do n't understand the other countries languages either lie . . or lacks patience oh , my what a claim to make . 
  have you ever been to denmark ? 
  it 's rarely a problem , to one 's face , that is * until * it becomes apparent both parties ** did n't ** understand the message completely or nuances of it . 
  to claim our languages are identical [ or near ] is a well-intentioned but misguided effort . 
  it strikes me that we , norwegians , still want to feel close to denmark . 
  it just is n't accurate to say it 's this close today . 
  possibly , 100 years ago and certainly 200 years ago it was . 
  languages change and evolve over time . 
  my danish inlaw lived here decades , but it took him a long while to pick up all the norwegian variations . 
   bokm\u00e5l is basically just danish that `` basically '' is * stretched * so far ... 
  i guess dutch is basically just german . 
   we are too lazy to take them haha , okay , that 's what my czech friends said as well . 
  they live here now and do n't want to go back . 
   our motto is `` pohoda '' = contentment . 
  til . 
  interesting !, 
  i was rather wondering why * that * is . 
  how are they `` biased '' though ? 
  the link you referred to cited academic circles rejecting the religious and their politics for fear that it would interfere with their professional work . 
  '' * ... [ they are ] open to discriminating against fundamentalists , evangelicals and to a lesser extent republicans . 
  * '' and '' * yancey also argues that the label of republican or christian may * ** not ** * be enough to trigger bias . 
  * '' rejecting creationists that wish to promote pseudo-science is n't wrong if you 're hiring scientists and teachers . 
  the west has very little in common in terms of politics ; our societies and political atmospheres are too different . 
  some patterns may be similar in the sense that gender , income and education have an effect . 
  i wish you both all the best !, 
  i hear bad things about the rural population from czechs that come from the countryside or prague . 
  is there a good reason for their complaints about the lack of opportunities and lifestyle ? 
  it 's great that you 're making something of yourself !, 
  you 're probably more motivated than most and will probably achieve more because of it . 
  interestingly , you currently fit the profile of [ my comment about denmark 's rotten banana . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dqg70/percentage_of_people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social/ct7oywc ), 
  i wonder why though , i would imagine other parts of the country with greater problems . 
  it 's just that the stats are n't available on lower levels ( nuts level 1 is used for larger states ) . 
  in the us . 
  that does n't make it valid for the world . 
   scrap the whole thing and start over . 
  in my opinion your points are not very good . 
  they seem built on a lack of historical and political background . 
  where 's the realism ? 
  do you imagine the us scrapping the federal gov ' t to fix it ? 
  the us had a civil war [ to keep the union ] , it took wwi and wwii to create europe 's . 
  people would * never * vote for a federal europe ; it would be like asking the us to vote on admitting mexico as the 51 . 
   how else on earth do you plan to achieve ever closer union ? 
  time . 
  as i said in my other comment ; it 's quite strange that you would attack the eu for being slow to consolidate - when your own federal state was built much the same way . 
  a lose union of nation states . 
  trade and mutual prosperity is the key .
