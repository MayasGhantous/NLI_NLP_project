   the european project is truly doomed now , granted it 's out of context , but this is often repeated by naysayers of all colors and it 's extremely naive . 
  this is not the local lions club or a mere corporation !, 
  the political elites are far too committed to the eu for it to be surrendered . 
  they will push onward no matter what temporary obstacles appear . 
  a century from now the greek debt will be a footnote . 
   there are so many more pressing and important matters , the fact the eu has not yet figured this out is ridiculous and juvenile . 
  ridiculous ? 
  far from it . 
  it leaves them free to focus , leaving the political dogfight and horsetrading for another future date . 
  again it seems you think the european parliament has some role to play ? 
  angela merkel does n't sit in the ep . 
  the head of the ecb does n't answer to the ep , he 's chosen by the european council ( the heads of state or government ) . 
  do n't you see why the germans would rather settle the greek issue before demoting their language ? 
  it 's most certainly `` juvenile '' , the union is young , the issue is premature . 
  it would be seen as insulting , degrading and unpopular with the masses . 
  why would they shoot themselves in the foot ? 
   how much democracy and discussion and open debate is being stifled because no one is speaking the same language ? 
  over time it might become easier to focus on one or some languages . 
  however the masses are not fluent english/german/french speakers today , how would they take part in the democratic process ? 
  the lack of democracy in the eu is already a hot topic , this would do nothing to improve it . 
  fortunately , the eu 's parliament is not where things happen for people . 
  our political debates are all on prime time tv in our * local * languages . 
  the same goes for our laws , even if people ca n't understand them , they 're in the local language . 
  this will likely continue for centuries . 
  you do n't let go of your national culture or language because it 's practical [ for the eu 's administration ] . 
   do not lecture me ... your accusation and assumption ... an uneducated hick with no right to an opinion my how aggressive you are ( ! ), 
  talk about putting words in my mouth . 
   i read the news and have familiarized myself with europe and yet you were the one to complain about an institution that all europeans know is largely irrelevant and powerless ? 
  the lack of democracy is at the heart of the eu , which is another reason my country is n't part of it . 
   can you address the point i was making now ? 
  sure . 
  that seems unlikely with eurostat and [ nuts levels ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/nomenclature_of_territorial_units_for_statistics ) ? 
  however , i found the following mentioned in [ a un document ] ( http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/dam/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.15/2013/wp_25_eurostat_d_en.pdf ) : `` it has been agreed that the ess has to move towards delivering data on poverty and inequality at the regional level . 
  improving the availability of regional data is an urgent policy need coming from dg regional policy ( dg regio ) , in the context of streamlining the eu 2020 strategy ... 
  reliable data ( preferably at ** nuts 2 ** level , and in exceptional cases ** nuts 1 ** for larger member states ) is needed ... '' `` in this context eurostat works together with those member states concerned ( others either have no nuts 1 and 2 or have already accurate estimates from eu-silc at regional level ) in order to improve the regional precision of their regional indicators . 
  these countries set up national actions plans for this purpose . 
  solutions proposed are very different from one country to another one ... '' here are the eurostat pages : - [ europe 2020 indicators - poverty and social exclusion ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/europe_2020_indicators_-_poverty_and_social_exclusion ) - [ eurostat `` people at risk of poverty or social exclusion '' ( 2015 ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion ) - [ eurostat data explorer ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=ilc_peps01&amp;lang=en ),

  [ the rotten banana ( map ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2n6tukp.jpg ) is what they call the west coast . 
  denmark 's continental landmass is far from their center of economic activity . 
  though the `` banana '' has reportedly [ moved eastwards as well ] ( http://i.imgur.com/32gf02q.png ) . 
  people and especially women , move to the bigger cities for jobs and education never to return . 
  those who stay are young men with less education and opportunities . 
  there are 60.000 uninhabited houses there , a substantial number . 
  the cities middelfart , fredericia , kolding , vejen , billund , vejle , \u00c5rhus and obviously copenhagen is where denmark 's economic activity is centered .

   the words appears in printed work during ww2 hmm , you mean wwi . 
  the second and greatest uptick is during wwii . 
  i wonder if sweden might have been occupied as well if kiruna 's exports had n't existed . 
  there 's a reason [ the allies and germans fought so hard over narvik \\ ( norway \\ ) ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/battles_of_narvik ) and its port . 
  in norway 's case it 's probably because we politically , culturally and financially support rural populations . 
  to preserve our nation , and our ability to be self-sufficient . 
  we do n't want the urbanization sweden experienced for example , leaving some regions barely populated and under-prioritized . 
  the difference can also be seen in our language politics . 
  dialects are important , supported and used in both media and politics in norway . 
  where as in sweden they have a more dominant standardized language . 
   how does malta compare to iceland , population-wise ? 
  or norway ? 
  would something like this happen to their representatives ? 
  first of all , we are n't and do n't want membership in the eu . 
  secondly , iceland  malta < norway in terms of population . 
  country | population -- | -- malta | 423,282 iceland | 323,000 norway | 5,084,000 denmark | 5,614,000, 
   that 's how all international business is done inaccurate , but generally true . 
   if you want to get into international politics i suppose one could argue that it 's more * intranational * at this level ? 
   i 'm thinking more about the long term effects , how much democracy and discussion and open debate is being stifled because no one is speaking the same language ? 
  this is somewhat of a misunderstanding on your part ; the eu parliament is not comparable with the us congress . 
  [ the eu commission ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/european_commission ) is more important than the eup . 
  the real discussions and groundwork is done in national parliaments . 
  the average citizen does n't care much about debates in the eu , it 's almost an irrelevance , he/she watches national news for what happened in their parliament/government . 
   how else on earth do you plan to achieve ever closer union ? 
  says the guy from the country that fought each other over their union ... :p the us literally grew from a union of nation states very similar to the current eu . 
   whose primary language is arabic arabic , or many arabic languages ? 
  they 're not even mutually intelligible from one end of the arab world to the other . 
  an arabic speaker from iraq , for example , can find it almost impossible to understand a local algerian , and vice versa . 
  however , both will be able to communicate in modern standard arabic . 
   it is every citizen 's right to be able to understand the laws while i understand your point , speaking as a jurist , that is not possible for most citizens regardless of language . 
  the language of any law requires interpretation . 
  it might as well be written in a `` foreign '' language for the average citizen . 
  sweden has recognized minority languages , they 're not official languages . 
  - the swedish language officially became the country 's main language in 2009 , when a new language law entered into effect . 
  - in 1999 , the minority language committee of sweden formally declared five minority languages of sweden : - finnish , sami , romani , yiddish , and me\u00e4nkieli ( tornedal finnish ) . 
  the minority languages have been legally recognized to protect the cultural and historical heritage of their respective speech communities . 
   under us law if a dollar is used in a transaction the us has jurisdiction , the key word ( s ) being `` us law '' which has * no effect * in switzerland or anywhere else . 
  we can safely ignore their laws , without any retaliation . 
   it does mean the american government can poke its nose in a lot of places . 
  you overestimate the power the us has abroad . 
  this is far from as simple or accurate as you claim here . 
  anyway , this is not related to the currency as such , more a question of [ american ] power and influence which is considerable . 
  cooperation is sometimes given , but not in all cases . 
  the information mostly flows one way though ( see the swift system ) . 
   because not being allowed into the us banking system is a strangulation on any economy . 
  that is a very strange way of putting things . 
  my local savings bank has no need for the us market at all , never has and never will . 
  my country will not be locked out because of it either . 
  the banks are free to operate . 
  international law , wto and other bilateral treaties means the us would never lock a country out unless there 's a much better justification . 
  the iran sanctions were un approved . 
  my country benefits from access to foreign markets in europe and asia primarily . 
  it would hurt a few businesses and banks to be shut out of the us market , but the us is n't our main market for anything . 
   its what the americans did to iran just now , us and iran have no trade whatsoever , you seem to be forgetting that this was a p5 +1 deal .
