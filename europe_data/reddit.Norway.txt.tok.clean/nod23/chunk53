  while the us did little trade with iran , europe had much more . 
  when the eu cut off oil imports that really hurt iran 's cashflow . 
  missing parts from boeing and iphones did n't hurt as much , hehe . 
   no one wants to lose the use of the dollar . 
  this makes no sense ? 
  dollars are purchased on the market , you do n't have to operate or have assets in the us to do so . 
  i think you misread/misinterpreted my statement ? 
  the swiss government cooperates with the us , but some swiss * banks * have chosen to pull out of the us market - and to reject existing/former us citizens as clients : `` the denial of bank services is most acute in switzerland because the august agreement it signed with the us has accelerated the impact of fatca . '', 
   since you 're getting some of those benefits whether or not you live in the us i 'd say its fair . 
  this does n't seem to apply to the dutch in question at least . 
  it does n't so much `` apply '' to the netherlands , since the us has no jurisdiction , but the banks that continue to do business in the us comply voluntarily [ or else ] . 
  some swiss banks simply refuse to deal with american citizens now . 
  they 're still what i associate with the * photo * . 
  that photo fits so well , it evoked memories of ~ ~ [ eug\u00e8ne delacroix 's `` liberty leading the people '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/eug%c3%a8ne_delacroix_-_la_libert%c3%a9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg ) ~ ~ or maybe it was [ les miserables ] ( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/91tmdjpgkjl._sl1500_.jpg ) i was thinking about . 
  well , he is a pu \\*\\* y. 
  yes , i 'm sure the polish government would make much better and more objective decisions . 
  i would n't fear corruption or lobbying at all . 
  bah , you 're mostly cherry picking to suit your views , then again it 's your problem , eu citizen . 
  before i studied [ eu ] law i could have seen your point ; afterwards i understand why those laws are actually required and helpful . 
  the regulations for what constitutes `` orange juice '' for example seems strange , but it 's actually all about making sure the playing field is level for all ( vendors ) , that consumers get what they expect and not something of lesser value/quality . 
  hehe , well , i suppose one reason is that * our * post-war reckoning was probably one of the most encompassing judicial processes in europe [ after the nuremberg trials ] . 
  we punished the guilty and accepted their return to society . 
  what 's done is done . 
  the norwegian occupation forces in post-war germany probably also helped , since it was hard to dispute the suffering of the civilian german population . 
  it took my grandparents some time to let it go , some of my mother 's family was jewish . 
  today , my neighbor is german , my mother 's best friend was a `` lebensborn '' . 
  i find german history and culture very interesting ; we learn from our mistakes after all . 
  ** the german link ** as you can see germany was very important for norway 's development . 
  our greatest artists , authors , composers , painters all studied , worked or lived in germany . 
  ( [ munch ] ( http://www.visitnorway.com/productimages/tellus/tellus_7057_23_large.jpg ) , ibsen , [ grieg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcezh3mwily ) for example ) . 
  our best engineering students were sent to german universities . 
  german was the language of science for centuries . 
  after wwii our bonds grew weaker , as we reorientated ourselves and our focus shifted to the anglo-american world . 
   i thought you were poor farmers and fishers . 
  the majority of the population were , but we grew rich on trade , mining and manufacturing \\* . 
  ** hansa ** prior to the kalmar union the hanse were important for our exports for a long while . 
  bergen was basically a german city , oslo and t\u00f8nsberg were other stops on the nord - * wegen * route  ** denmark-norway ** during the union norway was an exclusive market for danish grain by law . 
  while norway exported fish , minerals and products not manufactured in denmark such as glassware ( see also cobalt mines for [ blue glass ] ( http://blaa.aipublish.no/ai_files/5480_256_8264_nye_molla_051_406344.jpg ) ) . 
  the mining industry was setup using imported german experts and laws ( * berggesetze * ) . 
  silver and other minerals were exported to major markets in europe . 
  forestry and lumber exports was a huge business for many centuries . 
  england was our main market ( plank for ship building ) . 
  in the 20th century the norwegian paper products industry was huge . 
  ** industrialization ** for industrialization our [ hydro-electric capacity ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/norway-wants-to-offer-hydroelectric-resources-to-europe-a-835037.html ) was essential . 
  a legacy that has left us 99 % hydro powered for more than a century . 
  weaving mills and other factories blossomed during the 19th century . 
  this cheap energy source enabled us to establish heavy , power-hungry industries such as metal refineries . 
  today we export aluminium and car parts to all the major brands in the world ( see hydro , elkem , kongsberg auto ) . 
  one of our major industrial concerns , norsk hydro , was built using technology from both the us , norway and germany ; and in cooperation with i.g. 
  hydro has since split and is part of statoil ( energy ) and yara int ' l ( agri-biz ) . 
  ** fisheries ** our fish has always been traded far and near ; dried , salted or canned . 
  [ canning ] ( http://www.museumstavanger.no/museums/the-norwegian-canning-museum/ ) was an important industry in the 19th century . 
  today , the portuguese and brazilians could n't make their bacalao without our stock fish ( dried cod ) . 
  the japanese only began to eat salmon sushi because of our marketing efforts , hehe . 
   or is keeping out of costly wars ? 
  norway was part of denmark-norway . 
  [ we fought many wars ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/list_of_wars_involving_norway ) with sweden and other continental powers . 
  denmark 's greatest naval hero was a norwegian captain , '' [ tordenskiold ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/peter_tordenskjold ) '' , a fact we love to point out !, 
  rest in puddles . 
  typical germany , keeping track of the red ink in europe , 
   ( at least not in the coastal areas , which is most of the country ) . 
  [ the coldest parts of norway are inland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8iqxl7j.png ) ... ( inner finnmark and eastern norway ), 
   turkey has been in a conflict with the * turks * for decades . 
  eh , yes . 
   now they can live happily in malm\u00f6 and still work here and visit those of us they 've left behind . 
  thanks , i did n't care to explain it all . 
  yes , please , maybe we can finally get a rep in , 
   dude i was joking . 
  sorry , i realized , but got a bit hung up . 
   maybe i am , but putting a barrier does sound a bit hostile , does n't it ? 
  yeah , but i think that was said for soundbites and not meant to be taken literally . 
  clearly everyone loses here , but what else could they possibly do ? 
  the uk leaving the eu would also force them out of the eea . 
  the eu would lose face if they were to agree to some lesser fta ; that would mean the end for the eu . 
  the british banks would lose and gain markets . 
  all of the international companies based in the uk for european market access would probably reconsider their location . 
  ireland could benefit i suppose . 
  yes , that 's more like what i suppose would happen . 
   is n't reason and open-minded not an integral part of european culture or ... 
  the horror ... people lied to me ? 
  yes , it 's part of our culture , but there are many other aspects and elements . 
  we 're far from homogeneous in any sense , but surely you know this already . 
  you ca n't seriously expect everyone to act according to the highest standards possible ; most people will always protect their own interests first . 
  i do n't really see that as a valid critique of european culture ; about as much as suicide bombers are representative of their religion . 
   closing borders to one country is an hostile act . 
  i did n't say close , but you may be reading too much into the original quote . 
  they would * police * their borders and that 's not hostile . 
  they would decide who enters their country legally . 
   but we have a system called to take of that . 
  it actually does n't work for this at all for good reasons . 
  the swedish political parties would n't agree to any changes ; they 're appalled by the reasoning . 
  the two countries just do n't see eye to eye on this political and cultural issue , and as this is central to the eu 's freedoms ( movement ) they have no legal foundation . 
  there is no `` threat '' though , it 's a loaded word choice , it would just be fait accompli . 
  taking control of their own borders is not a hostile act . 
  yes , exactly , but you 're forgetting that norway has an * existing * relationship that 's half-way in . 
  if we were to drop that deal . . 
  the uk wo n't get an a la carte menu , and norway certainly wo n't !, 
  it 's more than just that though . 
  are you familiar with how sweden is effectively a gateway to denmark ? 
  it 's complicated but sweden in effect allows immigrants to circumvent danish laws in some respects .
