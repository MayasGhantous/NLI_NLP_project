  the reaction from north africa was that there were many who could trace their arab ancestors to andalucia . 
  they wanted similar rights , but that 's unlikely . 
  i can trace my ancestry back many centuries , on both sides of my family . 
  it gets a little fuzzy after 500 years , but it 's to be expected . 
  the church kept very detailed books , of every birth , marriage and death . 
  my own country 's books have been digitized , indexed and are available online free of charge . 
  here 's [ the 1664 census ] ( http://www.arkivverket.no/eng/content/view/full/5462 ) for example . 
  how can this be ?!, 
  okay , i 'll get some wine , but i 'll have to wait for the state run '' * vinmonopolet * '' monopoly to open . 
  at least they have really * decent * wine for a reasonable price , by comparison with cheap supermarket offers on the continent . 
  yes , ladino . 
  ashkenazic and sephardic jews represent two distinct subcultures of judaism . 
  it gets a bit more complicated , as sefardim were often better integrated in their regions historically . 
  [ tunisia still has them ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/world/africa/buffeted-by-tumult-jewish-population-in-tunisia-dwindles.html ) . 
  the sephardic jews came from spain , portugal , north africa and the middle east . 
  there 's also the mizrachi distinction . 
  in israel the ashkenazim held prominence in society , the divisions were ethnic and class based . 
  call it what you like . 
  [ the spanish jews were expelled ] ( http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaism/expulsion.html ) a long time ago . 
  for context see the reconquista of spain and the moors ( andalucia ) . 
  just last month [ spain announced a new law giving them citizenship ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.597359 ) to compensate for history 's wrong-doings . 
  it 's a conspiracy !, 
  it really seems as if you missed the joke ? 
  excellent . 
  when i can i invite my new compatriot for a beer ? 
  will you be arriving tomorrow or on tor 's day ? 
  it 's * ut * as a verb , like `` uit '' , * ute * is specifically outside . 
  yiddish takes about three-quarters of its vocabulary from german . 
  it likely came about under a thousand years ago . 
  it was only the default language for groups of ashkenazi jews . 
  i happen to be of that stock myself , but i only understand german . 
  it made sense for these recent immigrants to speak the dominant language of commerce in central and eastern europe . 
  germans were not limited to their present homelands at that time , their settlements and regions would later become justification for inclusion in a certain reich etc. 
  the ethnic group ashkenazim ( pl ) , i.e. 
  jew of central or eastern european descent is frequently found in europe , the us and israel . 
  the name comes from the medieval rabbinical name for germany . 
  the sephardic jews of spain , on the other hand , never spoke jiddisch , as they had no reason to learn it . 
  i ca n't speak for all of the examples or languages ; but norwegian `` utepils '' is more than simply drinking outside . 
  that would be simple enough to translate . 
  an * utepils * is a symbolic opening of the season `` ceremony '' . 
  usually with one or more friends at a restaurant/bar - while sitting outside obviously . 
  when pre-spring arrives , it can be a little nippy outside , but the sun finally makes an appearance again after a long , dark winter !, 
  it 's the joy and expectation of what 's to come [ social life , flirting , drinking and enjoyment ] . 
  the beer itself is just a marker . 
  most children were historically conceived during spring/summer in norway . 
  possibly also because * certain * other cultures have an idea about how `` melancholic '' germans are ? 
  or humorless . 
  i suppose that could lead to unconscious cherry picking ? 
  there 's more than just the words ; it 's cultural concepts [ at least the norwegian one is ] . 
   is yiddish and seems to sum up a lot of european jewish history yiddish ; a language used by jews in central and eastern europe before the holocaust . 
  it was originally a ** german dialect ** with words from hebrew and several modern languages ... 
  it seems you have the origins reversed ? 
  it 's a little bit more than just the act itself , but never mind . 
  missed norway-denmark ? 
  sorry , i honestly just thought you had some other perspective i could n't quite see , 
  ah , i see , that makes a lot more sense . 
  turns out it has nothing to do with italy , pigs or piigs . 
  the original is shown below , turns out it might be argentina ( ? ) . 
  this later bulgarian version just reused the heads ... 
  that 's the only g20 member that fits . 
   i like that they used retrospective animals apart from germany , and the obvious nazi reference , i do n't quite see what 's `` retrospective '' about it ? 
  - the gallic rooster is the unofficial national symbol of france , - the lion is a traditional symbol of great britain , - the eagle is the us ' national bird , - while the beaver has attained official status as an emblem of canada . 
  the italian one seems like an extra insult ? 
  the wolf is their symbol , but that appears to be a pig or boar . 
  edit : as noted further below it 's not even the original , as canada was originally japan etc. 
  i watched him after the election , he seemed so out of place in the ep . 
  he 's probably a good representative for spain , but are his views even remotely similar to that of other meps ? 
   venstre is the liberal party . 
  libertarians for americans . 
  classical liberal for europeans ( free market ) . 
  i just said people brought up the treaties , not that it acutally applied . 
  that seems like a rather meaningless distinction to me . 
  russia just re-took the crimea , and the first thing people wrote about was the treaty with the ottomans . 
  the inheritor countries usually get to keep their seats in the un ( ussr ) , the national debts etc. 
  what 's in a name , when everything else stays the same ? 
  turkey and russia have been at war before . 
  i doubt it will happen over crimea . 
  we deport people back to their country of origin to serve their time , and we have other prisons for foreigners , 
  i thought they actually applied for those from australia in advance ? 
  at least that 's the impression i had of those wishing/planning to spend a gap year abroad etc. 
  uk landing maybe and then first schengen entry in france or something . 
   i may have exaggerated a little . 
  that still does n't take away the fact that the wage a doctor makes is much higher than in most jobs . 
  lawyers can easily make similar or much more ( 10m as partner ) . 
  ceos/managing directors [ in norway ] make a lot more than that on average and as individuals . 
  i wonder how the numbers compare . 
  i have a meeting with legeforeningen next week , i 'll be sure to ask   the amount of immigrants who come to work here as doctors also show that the wages are competative on an international scale . 
  that may be true , but there are many who come for other reasons . 
  dutch/germans moving for a different lifestyle , swedish nurses for better conditions and pay , baltic nurses due to a collapsed economy , filipina nurses from a 3rd world country , extra-european medical professionals that ca n't get employment in for example germany etc. 
   last time i heard , he was only sorry for running over a rat ( ? ), 
  on his way to the island . 
  that 's part of his condition . 
  he does n't really understand other people or empathy . 
  from what i understand medication may work on him in some sense . 
  there 's no `` manipulation '' , medication and therapy may free him of his delusions . 
  he may suffer the realization that his worldview was wrong , his actions unjust and horrific , but it 's primarily about containment . 
   imo human rights shouldnt apply to the likes of brevik . 
  no , they should ** doubly ** apply to someone unworthy of our sympathy . 
  especially , if they 're considered `` evil '' . 
  that 's the key to a society * ruled by law * , not mercurial leaders or angry lynching mobs .
