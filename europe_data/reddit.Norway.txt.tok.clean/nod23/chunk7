  laws apply absolutely , to everyone , no matter what they did . 
   500 years ago he would have been physically tortured and mutilated so much that would beg for death , which would have been an example for anyone else trying to murder 80 kids . 
  yes , as a former student of law , i have learned a lot about the bloody traditions we have here in europe . 
  your understanding of the relationship between crime , punishment and prevention is entirely outdated and factually incorrect . 
  the proof is in the pudding ; no amount of torture or capital punishment has ever reduced or prevented crime !, 
  we study the historical justice systems at university and in science ( criminology ) ; there is ** no effect ** what so ever . 
  your sense of `` justice '' is entirely unrelated , it 's a basic emotional reaction . 
  a justice system is designed to replace the need for personal retribution and blood vendettas , the state punishes criminals without the need for emotions . 
  - interestingly , `` an eye for an eye '' was a jewish * tort * rule ( monetary compensation ) , not an actual right to retaliate . 
  norwegians are satisfied with our justice system by and large - and even the survivors/victims of breivik are content to see him languish in prison . 
  who are you to question them , science and scholars ? 
  that 's the average of course . 
  also , how many actually work in the private sector in norway ? 
  i 'd say 1 mill is pretty normal , but that 's actually far * below * your claim of 300k usd ... ( 1,8 mill ) . 
   they are restricted to the uk well , no , i 'm talking about working in the uk , but traveling around europe using their separate schengen visas , 
  sorry , i just edited my reply . 
  - according to ssb it 's ~ 780 000 nok or  $ 100 000 usd on average for md 's , [ source ] ( http://www.ssb.no/lonnstasyk ) . 
  that 's the average for a surgeon in the us ? 
  most norwegian medical professionals do not make that kind of money , or do you have better sources ?

  hehe , thanks for the laugh  i accept your apology . 
  hehe , no problem , it 's always interesting to learn more and discuss . 
  funny , that you should be a lawyer as well , but i guess we 're drawn to these kinds of subjects . 
   edit : i missed the first bit of your comment . 
  if i recall , it was brevik himself who swore he was fine , and refused any treatment . 
  so the judge agreed i guess ? 
  the * judges * in fact , our system does n't use a jury , but lay judges at various levels ( 1st/2nd instances ) . 
  where you have the adversarial system ( common law ) , we have the `` inquisitorial '' ( civil law ) . 
  a majority of the world 's countries have legal systems like ours , but german/scandinavian courts again are slightly different . 
  more to the point , the judge 's opinion is n't as important as facts and rules , i.e. 
  what can be documented . 
  legal guarantees ( civil rights ) etc. 
  yeah , i know the legal systems of both countries well . 
  what i meant , was that it seems that you 're saying he 's both abnormal and normal . 
  it strikes me as contradictory , but there 's no need to quarrel over such minor points now . 
  he was evaluated before and during the trial by two teams . 
  interestingly , the prosecution wanted him to get treatment , the defense asked for jail [ as they claimed he * was n't * sick ] ...  that does n't mean he is totally normal . 
  sick , yet normal ? 
  your logic seems lacking or contradictory ? 
  the best possible punishment is seeing his `` work '' undone and ridiculed , his social status the lowest possible , no glory or support for him , and being met by professionals that challenge and destroy his world view ... his own personal hell . 
  ah , but they ca n't travel around europe as easily i suppose . 
  no , but * the professionals * ( plural ) that evaluated him came to that conclusion . 
  he would likely improve over time with medication and years of treatment . 
  there were symptoms already as a child , it 's well documented in his file at norway 's child protective services . 
  the father left the family , and the mother was `` probably '' not up to scratch . 
  no , no , it 's `` at least we 're not actually sweden '' . 
  we reduce their debt under our present system ... move to troms\u00f8 and work for a few years . 
  public service . 
  is n't your argument pretty bad considering the low wages of norwegian doctors ? 
  they 're hardly well paid by int ' l standards . 
  it 's strange that people pick up on this , but i 've seen crazy people write about it on youtube . 
  it 's as if they do n't have child protective services in other countries . 
  i guess in some cultures like india they do n't understand the welfare state . 
  barnevernet does n't even take children away unless there 's an immediate risk and violence etc. 
   barnevernet - child protection agency that is stealing kids from parents at whim . 
  utter nonsense ( ! ), 
  that 's usually crap made-up by some rather `` strange '' individuals . 
  the barnevernet only steps in if it has to ( violence ) , in most cases they 'll try to help the parents without removing the child from them !, 
   swedes are your australians i hear there 's a drop in australians coming to the uk ? 
  i mean the typical working abroad for a year kind . 
   the least norway could do is make their lives a bit more spartan than that of hard working citizens . 
  a large percentage of ordinary norwegians have second homes or expensive boats . 
  breivik 's prison life is spartan by comparison . 
  first step , get a job offer from a company in norway , then work three years for residency . 
  seven [ legal ] years for citizenship ( students not eligible ) . 
  i thought you guys were trying to build prisons in romania ? 
  i thought norway 's average was 20 % , 16 % for bast\u00f8ya . 
  what punishment would be fitting ? 
  a simple death sentence !? 
  a quick end to his `` suffering '' and delusions ? 
   killing anders breivik would n't have brought back any of is victims and the families of his victims would still feel the same pain . 
  even more so [ some of the outspoken ] families and * survivors * have publically supported our justice system and the treatment breivik received . 
  he 's not a `` demon '' , he 's one of * us * ( citizens ) . 
  despite all the evil acts , he 's just a sick man . 
  the children/young adults who survived the ut\u00f8ya massacre whole-heartedly support our justice system ( or at least the one 's who did so in the newspapers ) . 
  may i suggest that you read this account of the different reactions to murder in the uk and norway ? 
  yes , i know . 
  the old nordic passport union is gone . 
  however , that does n't mean we ca n't block them . 
  we could easily allow swedish passports entry ( unilateraly ) , but they would have to show them at the border . 
  the swedes have a huge youth unemployment problem , they 're literally `` dumping '' them on us in some municipalities ( by paying for bus fair to oslo etc ) . 
  i wonder if they would n't mind making an exception for us , in order for them to have access to norway ... 
  okay , that 's a fair point . 
  oslo is pretty high up there with zurich and tokyo , in the most expensive cities of the world rankings . 
  haha , you 're clearly missing the / s. 
  yes , absolutely , norway should probably reconsider the eea agreement or at least schengen . 
  if eu citizens have legitimate business in norway they should have no problems . 
   a lot of students end up living in privately rented , quite shitty apartments or in * really * expensive , but nice apartments . 
    but anyway , i 'd not think norway is paradise if i was a beggar as it will soon be forbidden to beg . 
   norway has plenty of social security nets to prevent street poverty . 
  it 's the `` visiting '' eu citizens that are the target , drug addicts already get welfare assistance . 
   i 'd not think norway is paradise if i was a beggar as it will soon be forbidden to beg . 
  ah , swedish media !, 
  always on the mark , hehe . 
  yes , it * might * end up being illegal . 
  especially for visiting bands of romanian `` beggars '' and minor criminals . 
  i ca n't possibly see why we should allow * non-citizens * access to the country if they 're not here to find work . 
  eu citizens are only allowed to visit as tourists or seek * work * . 
  i 'm not saying they 're all the same , but we have had gangs of romanians going around the country . 
  pickpockets , robbing old women on the street for their jewlery , beating up pensioners in their homes for petty cash , selling false `` gold '' etc.
