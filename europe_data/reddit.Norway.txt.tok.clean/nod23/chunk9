   having to welcome their citizens with open arms into the country to continue their criminality here whilst poncing off the state . 
  the vast majority of european migrants are * workers * . 
  very few are of them are actually poncing off the state , despite the tabloid headlines . 
  granted , it might be different in the uk . 
  we have tens of thousands of poles and baltic migrants in norway ; they 're one of our most valuable assets . 
  think about the following : - you either build up countries systematically , or you get regional problems with war , criminality etc. 
  that spills over into your country in the form of organized crime , refugees and emergency financial support for another crisis . 
  see the yugoslav states . 
  - you either accept that poor migrants is one ingredient in the recipe for economic growth , or you accept that your economy will become increasingly lethargic . 
  the us is a great example of an economy powered by migrants . 
   the euro is not a requirement for being the eu . 
  yes , it is . 
  let me quote the first paragraph of the page below : - `` all member states of the european union , * except * denmark and the united kingdom , are ** required to adopt the euro ** and join the euro area . 
  to do this they must meet certain conditions known as ` convergence criteria ' . '', 
   there is no language that is only spoken in switserland , by all switserlanders and only by switserlanders if you had n't added that part about `` all switserlanders '' i would have disagreed . 
  thanks , i did n't know that . 
   there is no switserlandish the german spoken there is very much unique to them ? 
  hehe , yeah , i meant that looks like the same bonfire , right ? 
  our [ white walkers are usually quite tasty ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/migration_catalog/article6627773.ece/binary/w780/+scc-aipub-g-tittel-sy87f22c.jpg ), 
  iceland is n't that near the poles by comparison with northern norway ... 
  [ the inter-frisian flag ] ( http://www.groepfanauwerk.com/flagge%20goeie%20maten.jpg ) seems very relevant  source : [ groep fan auwerk ] ( http://www.groepfanauwerk.com/homeiflagge.html ), 
  do n't you have bonfires like the rest of the country ?!, 
  up here it does n't really matter what you call it any longer ... day and night are almost the same . 
  everyone knows [ how you swedes celebrate midsummer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvwkljdkv8w ) ( warning : joke ), 
  yeah , [ it was featured ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/t%c3%b8nneb%c3%a5l.jpg/1024px-t%c3%b8nneb%c3%a5l.jpg ) in the wikipedia article as well , 
  yes , absolutely !, 
   these are tones of news about raped women in a name of allah not in any serious newspaper in scandinavia . 
  the police do n't say so either . 
  i 've worked in poland and companies - you guys have crazy views , crazy politicians and less serious media . 
   you need to look at it and also read quran i read it years ago ( danish translation ) . 
  i 've studied law at uni and comparative law studies includes islamic law . 
  did you know that jewish religious courts are present in london ? 
  or that marriage/divorce in israel is decided by the religious courts ? 
   sweden is known for high number of muslim immigrants and people/politicians are trying to hide problems . 
  maybe in poland where facts do n't seem to matter much . 
  the swedes are politically correct , much more than in norway . 
  they 're not hiding problems , as much as trying to focus on the facts . 
  as i said , i do n't like immigration - but muslims are not evil animals that roam the streets . 
   stats are about rape , and only about it . 
  sweden is like big dot in europe in that kind of stats . 
  and it is connected with muslim population . 
  i 'm afraid your knowledge of swedish stats , rape and muslims is far from accurate . 
  your fear of muslims is not substantiated by facts . 
  naturally , sweden will have greater numbers !, 
  the muslim/immigrant factor is misunderstood ; they 're over-represented in terms of percent , but * most * rapes are done by swedes . 
  in norway most rapes are committed by native norwegians ( at home , parties , between friends etc. 
  ) ; immigrants however are overrepresented on the violent sex crimes stats ( including rape ) . 
   vietnamese immigrants ( if you have them in scandinavia ) are also non-european you did misunderstand slightly ; most muslims in scandinavia are non-europeans , that does n't mean all non-europeans are muslim . 
  it is however relevant to the discussion that they 're mostly non-europeans . 
  we have a lot of vietnamese , but they are very * well integrated * in scandinavia . 
  that 's the key difference between them and the [ mostly ] non-european muslims here . 
  the turkish minority have integrated fairly well , but they 're still quite insular by comparison . 
  the pakistanis are slightly less integrated . 
  the somalis are the least integrated . 
   for muslims raping a christian or atheist women is not rape it 's `` justice '' ( for idk what ) this type of factoid can only be found on right-wing , nonsense websites . 
  rapists are motivated by power/sexual urges . 
  if they happen to also be muslims - there is no recorded data of their intent to rape as `` punishment '' . 
  please , provide a credible source for this claim . 
  no problem  i 'm sure we both wanted to be precise . 
  it was n't really realistic to begin with , there 's a reason it has taken this long . 
  on the other hand what does turkey need membership for ? 
  you 're doing great alone . 
  it 's * not * actually a question ... 
  it 's `` tell me more about russia if you like '' . 
  the problem is that `` rape '' in sweden is * not * rape in poland ... 
  they categorize many more sex crimes as `` rape '' . 
  while there 's also the fact that swedes report more often than poland , where you have under-reporting of actual crimes . 
  do you see the problem ? 
  while some of the rape is certainly done by muslims , it 's not motivated by religion . 
  are christian rapists doing it in the name of jesus ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not a big fan of non-white immigrants for many reasons . 
  however , you have to be objective and actually find data that supports your argument , not the other way around . 
  muslim is not race . 
  it 's people who believe in religion which is turning europe into 3rd world . 
  look how they treat women . 
  no , it 's not a race , but muslims are generally non-europeans in sweden/scandinavia/europe . 
  it 's very relevant to the discussion . 
  yes , some muslims control their families much more than europeans . 
  does that mean they all do ? 
  furthermore , the fact that young , uneducated , poor and foreign men commit sex crimes is not surprising . 
  they do n't understand the culture they 're in , they may feel like outsiders culturally , or misunderstand that women have value/respect here . 
  it 's all about education , but also an inherent danger of immigration from distant cultures . 
  i doubt a polish man in sweden would rape as easily , but he still might if he thinks he can get away with it . 
  only a very few immigrants actually rape someone . 
  that 's still one rapist too many ( ! ), 
  somalia sounds better , hehe . 
  thanks , you made a very convincing argument and clearly had much more interesting things to say than i first imagined . 
  still . 
  i do n't think it 's a common definition , or do you have a source as well ? 
  you 're right . 
  it was just an illustration of the people around sochi and crimea . 
  krasnodar krai is home for 24,840 tatars . 
  i knew it was in that krai , but it 's the same general area . 
  russia 's conquest was n't along natural lines , was it ? 
   they are something like the usa with one culture built by different cultures and where everyone stands behind the same ideals sorry , but i have to point out the errors here . 
  iran has a majority of persians . 
  they [ do however have minorities ] ( http://www.iranchamber.com/people/articles/iranian_ethnic_groups.php ) of arabs ( non-persians obviously ) , ** kurds ** ( see kurdistan and syria/iraq war now ) and baluchis ( see present day pakistan ) . 
   it 's different from yugoslavia , turkey , russian federation , macedonia , bosnia , serbia , switzerland , belgium is n't it very * similar * to former yugoslavia in some sense ? 
  a little similar to the russian federation ( without actual republics ) , switzerland ( various linguistic regions ) and belgium ( hard lines between walloons , flemish and german minority , each group has their own * parliament * ! ) . 
  turkey 's kurds would love to join kurdistan , i 'm sure iran 's kurds would as well .
