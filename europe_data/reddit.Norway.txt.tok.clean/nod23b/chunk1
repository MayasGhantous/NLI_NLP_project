the romanian ones looked very sketchy and like they were filmed with a potato . 
  kinky exports for latvia maybe ? 
  it seems [ a swede knows why ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4huonr/what_denmark_thinks_of_europe/d2t5z32 ), 
  [ see this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4huonr/what_denmark_thinks_of_europe/d2t5z32 ), 
  it 's obviously a reference to their plans for a greater germany , norway will just become a province in the new reich . 
  they 'll leave the swedes alone just like last time . 
  we 'll soon see if that 's possible . 
  the uk believes it can have it all . 
  the eu has said it will cost them a pretty penny to get even remotely similar terms . 
  my country , norway , pays a lot for market access , without a seat at the table . 
   all benefits on ue are from my tax that 's clearly not accurate . 
  heck , even * my * taxes goes to pay for projects in your country !, 
  we 've literally spent hundreds of millions of euros , as part of the trade agreement with the eu . 
  the remittances alone are huge . 
  the financial investments made in poland depend on your trade relationship with the eu . 
  i suppose you believe you could be `` outside '' and still have freedom of movement , right ? 
  exactly how would poland benefit from being outside the eu ? 
  technically , they 're all required to join the eurozone over time . 
  the uk and denmark have exceptions in the treaty . 
  what ? 
  the north pole is n't a country :p, 
  you trust the americans with geography ? 
  just kidding , 
   seized for restorations that 's a very unusual phrase . 
  one you wo n't find required/applicable in other european countries . 
  we do n't `` seize '' places we intend to restore . 
  why would you even need to ? 
  that 's also quite strange , as long you claim to be secular . 
  it 's just extra surprising in light of turkey 's modern history , with atat\u00fcrk 's emphasis on secularization and modernization . 
  czechia 's recent history is n't nearly as controversial in this regard . 
  the secular state of turkey owns the places of worship ? 
  how odd !, 
  even in my officially christian kingdom , with a national church , we do n't own the churches . 
  edit : to be clear , we 're * still * officially christian as per our constitution , despite our recent changes to it . 
  we did n't completely split [ the ] state and church as some ill-informed individuals would have it . 
  renovation project ? 
  ok , but why the seizure ? 
   spent shit tons of money on building and restoring hundreds of churches that sounds nice and all , but where i live we would ask the owners first . 
  now , i do n't know if the article is accurate , but `` seizing '' a church seems odd to me . 
  why not also mention the museums that are free \\* every day , all year round ? 
   why would it cost 300k ? 
  because we build more than simple cabins and to a different quality than polish [ wooden ] houses . 
  today , we build modern passive houses with heat recycling and climate control systems . 
  i think you would be surprised to learn how we build houses . 
  i guess you 'll never know though . 
  i used to work for the wood products industry in norway and poland/baltics ( norwegian owned factories ) . 
  you provide very little of what we use to build our houses . 
  you do get that he 's joking ? 
   the house itself seems to be made of wood ( wtf ) and looks very cheap , i guess at most ** $ 30k ** to build , probably less . 
  haha , 30k !, 
  it would cost at least 300k here . 
  you polish people need to get over your prejudices about wooden houses . 
  he 's probably adjusting for his international audience . 
  a city of 40.000 would be considered decent here as well . 
  my municipality has around 6000 citizen . 
  finland is so far away from the atlantic that i wonder how much it matters . 
  recent research shows that the [ rocky mountains ] ( http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/postcomment.aspx?id=999&amp;y=2006&amp;no=4&amp;page=3 ) airflow has a considerable impact on the region . 
  nah , yours went a lot further south-east [ of finland ] . 
  it 's just cultural , he just does n't `` get '' them . 
  he 's used to brick and mortar , 
  i remember your name , are you a student ? 
   very similar to the dutch name ( tsjechi\u00eb ) . 
  our version is even closer ( tsjekkia ) . 
  it 's so hard to believe that someone even downvoted you !, 
  it 's pronounced differently though . 
  `` denmark-norway '' , as in the king of denmark and his nobles , is more accurate . 
  it was n't out of friendship with france . 
  the `` great game '' is first and foremost practical . 
  bah , that 's hardly something that made us as a people feel especially `` connected '' to the french . 
  we certainly do n't have a `` friendship '' based on that , neither unofficially or officially . 
  contrast it with our relationship with denmark | sweden for example . 
  there 's nothing there , between norway and france , that i can remember and i know my history . 
  the swedes have a thing for french ( language ) and their royal family came from france . 
  i 'm making a * political * point here ... 
   norway is a big and empty country that ignores the fact that our city and highways are just like other european countries ' roads ... our idiots are every bit as bad as yours !, 
   if ever russia gets invaded again that does n't really seem relevant to the video ? 
   to deal with riots ? 
  public protests are not riots . 
  they can turn into riots . 
    we 'd talk about the process of improvement and prevention over lunch or coffee  as i said , i doubt a common worker will talk about such things :p are you sure ? 
  i mean everything from talking about the new , odd sounds when using a machine ( see prevention/maintenance ) . 
  or maybe suggesting moving some raw materials from storage onto the floor for quicker access to reduce downtime etc. 
   people working in a factory seldom need to talk to each other , i do n't think i agree with you about that , but that 's just my opinion . 
  circumstances can vary greatly , i suppose . 
  my father and i used to run a factory until recently . 
  over the years he has run several that i 've been involved in to a lesser degree . 
  if there 's one thing that really pays off it 's having people talk informally about work . 
   about the work they 're doing they do while working i wonder you mean just the operational discussions ? 
  i 'm not talking about the work orders or materials requirements . 
  we 'd talk about the process of improvement and prevention over lunch or coffee . 
  adjusting purchasing to fit progress deviations . 
  how to organize the shifts to better fit our delivery plans etc. 
  maintenance suggestions or possible faults in the machinery . 
  please , note that i 'm talking about the manager and shop worker directly . 
  that kind of thing , 
  oh , right . 
  i completely forgot about them . 
  it 's actually pretty ironic since i just talked with a girl from there studying in norway ... xd, 
  how does that even remotely apply to the council of europe ? 
  if you have no money , go work , hehe .
