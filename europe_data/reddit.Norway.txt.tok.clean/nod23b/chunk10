  the context is specifically imported american candy . 
  i think you know already . 
   obviously someone there is buying this stuff if it is appearing on store shelves like this . 
  yeah , some other guy said it was an american section in a specific supermarket . 
  it 's not the regular candy aisle . 
  i guess it 's for ex-pats and others , so there 's a market for it [ in that supermarket ] . 
   like , if no one bought american chocolates , they would n't show up on your shelves anyways guys ... that 's not entirely true , is it ? 
  that 's how marketing works ; you push the product and make it available first . 
  you have to create the demand !, 
  now , this is n't exactly a common sight , so the truth of the matter is that this is an `` american section '' in a rather unique supermarket . 
  i guess ex-pats and the curious buy it . 
  they 're not available on our shelves in general . 
   the war is coming . 
  very russian !, 
   i think it was mainly implemented as a way to save money . 
  yep , at least in scandinavia they are , labor is expensive ( i.e. 
  paid well ) . 
  while we 're talking about chocolate it 's interesting [ read about cadbury \\ ( uk \\ ) in the us ] ( http://qz.com/334333/how-cadbury-lost-the-right-to-sell-its-own-chocolate-in-the-us/ ) . 
  it 's not an example of trade barriers , just legal ownership of trademarks and competition . 
  by all means , it should be a free market . 
  consumers should vote with their money and mouths . 
  it 's just a shame the us market is n't always as `` free '' as they claim ( see various trade barriers ) . 
  they do n't exist any longer ? 
  just ahold it seems . 
  at least in norway and denmark they 're common . 
  i guess it helps that a norwegian company owns major supermarkets in norway and denmark ( rema 1000 , kiwi , etc ) . 
  yeah , i was just addressing the aftertaste issue . 
  are the products pictured from hershey 's ? 
  do n't you guys have local brands ? 
  they 're common in scandinavia at least . 
   has sort of a vomity aftertaste that you can only get used to if your grow up with it . 
  that 's because they specifically add that to american chocolate . 
  i forget what it is , but it 's an ingredient . 
  what was mittwoch originally ? 
  do n't worry when they find oil - they 'll re-join us , 
  or in two-three years time . 
   christiania 1700 i have that in my list already , but [ the artist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_william_edy ) was n't born until 1760 !, 
  the aquatints were made in the summer of 1800 between 31 july and the end of september .

  they 're really great , but i must say other continents have a great deal to offer !, 
  i 've only seen european , us and some asian cities , but i realize the same must apply to africa and latin america , etc. 
   at least historically . 
  that invalidates your whole complaint . 
  you ca n't have * and * not have them . 
  make up your mind !, 
   i do n't know if i want to drive without a manual transmission haha . 
  i have n't really thought about that aspect . 
  it would n't be that bad , i guess . 
  i would almost be foolish not to take advantage of the great deals on offer now . 
  which is a shame since my car is just a couple of years old . 
  the range will be more than good enough , and the low cost per kilometer would save me a lot of money . 
   you live in the suburbs , it can take a half hour to an hour to get to your job . 
  we all have our ideas about other places that can be wrong . 
  driving an hour is very typical for people in my country/region as well . 
  i used to drive 1-2 hours each way . 
  i 'm down to half an hour now ( 2x ) . 
  i could n't trust an ev 's range for that reason . 
  yeah , i fully agree . 
  i really hope you 're not being sarcastic . 
  there are genetic links though . 
  `` handle it '' , i.e. 
  deal with it . 
   is there an efta institution i 'm not aware of that we 're not paying for ? 
  i guess the efta institutions , like the efta court . 
  since you 're not part of the eea i guess you do n't take part there . 
   still making us subject to the eu via eea what exactly do you people expect ? 
   if the uk joining efta were put to a referendum i do n't think they would be blocked . 
  `` would you like to expand efta and subsequently the eea agreement to include areas that were n't previously included ? '', 
  that question would probably result in a ` no ' majority . 
  in fact most eu related referendums would . 
  or rather change it in ways we do n't . 
  norway does n't want agricultural imports , while the brits are fine with that . 
  the uk relies on financial services , that 's less interesting to us . 
   norway hardly has `` superpower status '' within the efta who pays the bills ? 
  norway does . 
  you guys are n't even part of the eea . 
  it would certainly have to as agriculture is n't part of it , and the british are worried about immigration and financial services . 
  well , yes , but i did n't want to ... 
   ca n't wait to see how this attitude mixes with shariah law . 
  you 'll have to wait a long * effin * time since that 's not happening . 
   a certified doctor being a taxi driver in norway because norwaegian hospitals would not employ him even if he lived 10 years and knows the language his education has to be accepted as well . 
  if it 's not from a european university or fairly recent he could be required to take courses , etc. 
  that could limit his employment opportunities . 
  maybe he did n't speak the language to the degree he claimed . 
   naturally , since i do n't want to learn norwegian i just wo n't move there and i 'll leave it at that . 
  not sure why the downvotes , it 's not like i 'm forcing anyone to adapt to me . 
  it 's fairly typical and reasonable expectation in most european countries and the us that immigrants should learn the local language or gtfo . 
  you want to have your cake and eat it too . 
  no , not in general . 
  individual companies ' office culture determines what 's expected . 
  there 's very little difference between leaders and employees including clothing . 
  - management in the biggest corporations usually dress better in my experience . 
  - consultants are expected to dress better ( shirts and nice trousers ) . 
  - lawyers often wear full suits ( w/robes in court ) . 
  we dress up for social events , and down for work . 
  we see swedes as more formal , so you may have a point .
