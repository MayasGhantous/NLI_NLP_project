  i work with swedes a lot , but we mostly dress the same [ depending on your position ] . 
   speaking loudly ... is probably for americans nope , italians , africans , etc. 
  all of those groups qualify . 
  we generally do n't talk on the bus or train . 
   i 'm not sure who the bragging point is directed at ? 
  it 's not directed at other nationalities . 
  you 've never heard of [ janteloven ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante ) i guess . 
  it 's central to nordic culture . 
   but i do n't see nothing * wrong * with those institutions . 
  ftfy, 
  i agree . 
  we move existing and place new agencies around the country in order to spread the jobs . 
  there 's no reason to keep them all in the capital with its high costs/wages , when we have the modern infrastructure to support them ( internet and airports ) . 
   based anywhere but where one normaly expects govt . 
  agencies to be placed . 
  here in norway we deliberately move them out of the capital to different locations around the country . 
  it creates jobs and demand for local services . 
  there 's no reason they have to be in the same city these days . 
  yes , a basic automatic reflex , * animal * reflexes . 
  haha , that 's not late by other countries ' standards , but i guess you 're joking . 
  though , i would notice such a delay where i live . 
  the automatic displays at our bus stops are quite precise ( eta ) . 
  here 's the norwegian version : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/10-year-old-norwegian-boy-who-took-his-parents-car-tells-police-hes-a-dwarf-9125362.html, 
  [ `` 10-year-old norwegian boy claims he 's a dwarf when police stopped him driving his parents ' car '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/10-year-old-norwegian-boy-who-took-his-parents-car-tells-police-hes-a-dwarf-9125362.html ) - boy , 10 , put his 18-month old sister in car and drove to visit grandparents - made it 10kms before veering off the snowy norwegian road - told police he was a dwarf who forgot his driver 's licence - the children were uninjured and the car was undamaged, 
  which it naturally should be ( weaker ) . 
  it 's not effective , useful or desirable . 
   they were pretty pissed at the agreement yeah , i can imagine !, 
  xd out of the 3800 in norwegian prisons today , 120 are romanians . 
  the second largest group of foreign nationals . 
  the queue is so long [ to serve ] that we now send prisoners to the netherlands ( ! ), 
   built with the help of the norwegian government . 
  norway funds a number of activities in europe because of the eea agreement with the eu . 
  you might as well use them on something you need  - [ romania will receive 500 million euro in 2014-2021 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kxpgbqh.png ) - [ we support a range of activities ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ekwzvy1.png ), 
  no , i do n't watch tv . 
  i did watch that show once though . 
  haha , we will accept your generous gifts , when you declare them at the border , 
  haha , you 're asking for a lot of work !, 
  there are so many reports ( pdfs ) and stats available on the public websites i could spend hours . 
  i wo n't do that , but i can give you some quick tidbits ? 
  here 's [ a quote from statistics norway 's report on crime ] ( http://ssb.no/sosiale-forhold-og-kriminalitet/artikler-og-publikasjoner/sosiale-indikatorer-1980-2004-kriminalitet ) : `` persons with non-western backgrounds are also overrepresented in the statistics on violent offenders - even when we take into account immigrant population distribution by age , sex and place of residence . 
  how large overrepresentation is varies depending on which groups of the population we are talking about . '', 
  here 's a quote from daily newspaper [ `` dagbladet '' \\ ( 2013 \\ ) ] ( http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/06/17/nyheter/innvandring/kriminalitet/16958521/ ) : `` especially the african countries , kosovo , iraq and iran look especially bad , both if one counts the accused , convicted and imprisoned . '', 
  `` during the four year period 2005-2008 17 per cent of iraqi immigrants were convicted in a criminal case [ in norway ] . 
  the same applied to 16 per cent of immigrants from kosovo , 15 percent of somali and 14 percent of afghan and iranian immigrants . 
  only 5.3 percent of non-immigrants was sentenced in the same period . '', 
  `` the impact is even higher in a review of persons who were charged with offenses ( committed between 2001 and 2004 ) , that matters not necessarily ended with judgment : - 23.6 percent of norway around 19,000 iraqi immigrants were in the period charged at least one offense . 
  - for immigrants from somalia - around 17,000 people - the figure was 21.8 percent , - while 19.4 percent of iranian immigrants and - 18.1 per cent from morocco appeared as offenders . '', 
  just for informational purposes , [ here 's an extract from an old report showing criminals and their nationality . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tod7ayt.png ) here 's [ the norwegian police 's reports on deportations . 
  ] ( https://www.politi.no/politiets_utlendingsenhet/statistikk/ ) they 're all in norwegian and pdfs . 
  they only show what they managed to effectuate . 
  they 're both slow and unable to return everyone to their country of origin ( north africa in particular ) . 
  an xbox is not a luxury in norway , but maybe that 's the case in estonia ( / s ) . 
  now , i 've never been a prisoner myself , but i 've been in the courts on [ almost all ] sides . 
  i 've read the literature , studied the history of punishment/prisons and visited a prison . 
  what i 've learned is that the only thing less helpful to recovery is locking people up in dark little rooms without anything to do . 
  it creates * nothing * but frustration , hatred and mental diseases . 
  giving prisoners activities is not harmful , it 's * helpful * in their treatment . 
  it gives the prison staff , guards and other workers , ways of interacting with the prisoners . 
  it lets them socialize and find outlets . 
  it can even be taken away as punishment for minor infractions . 
  sorry , i do n't remember the details . 
  i expect that is outweighed by the nigerians constantly returning from italy ... 
  i do n't remember the details that well , i read the reports and books a long while ago . 
  yeah , but your statement was very broad ( `` norwegian dorms '' ) . 
   punishment , rehabilitation , and penitence . 
  these are emphatically not mutually exclusive things that 's [ restorative justice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/restorative_justice ) in a nutshell . 
  the core of norway 's system , 
   the victim is caught left short in terms of retribution that 's * not * what justice is about . 
  it 's what some cultures focus on . 
   now it might be just a meme when people say better get arrested in norway then , but this might actually become worrisome if an ever becoming larger amount of people would actually be willing to do this , if their living standard is below , say , a norwegian prison environment . 
  we have return agreements with countries like romania for example . 
  the prisoners can be sent to serve their time in romania ... 
  yep , we have a mass murderer . 
  interestingly , a serial killer is very different . 
  a serial killer is a person who murders three or more people , usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification , with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant break ( a `` cooling off period '' ) between them . 
   `` kriminalomsorgen '' ( criminal care ) . 
  yes , that 's the point i often make as well . 
  it 's penal law ( or penal code ) . 
  the people coming here are usually dutch ethnic , since you want the drug mule to be less visibly noticeable . 
  just another dutch tourist you know . 
  the moroccans are probably less on the road . 
   the point of the criminal law is to deter and punish hello america !, 
  no , that 's not the point of a justice system . 
  it has never worked that way . 
  no death penalty ever stopped murder . 
  punishment never stops criminals from reoffending . 
   i want to punish that 's more typical of the us and uk according to research . 
   punishment is n't going to stop crime . 
  that 's what all the text books says as well !, 
  that 's why the state has that role and a monopoly on violence . 
  people are `` logical '' in that they want to punish offenders . 
  it just does n't work !, 
  no death penalty has ever stopped crimes . 
  there 's no justice in murder or violence . 
  when people took the law into their hands they started vendettas . 
  we used to torture and kill criminals in public in the past , even here in norway . 
  it never helped anyone , not even the victims . 
   unjust that some criminals who will never reform get to live comfortably for their often horrific crimes . 
  you 're confusing punishment and revenge with justice .
