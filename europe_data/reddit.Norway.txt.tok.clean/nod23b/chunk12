  we have return agreement with romania for example ... to serve their time in romanian prisons . 
   a prison is still a prison that 's what the prisoners say in all of the interviews as well . 
  i believe it 's part of the deal that the family gets some support to travel there . 
  that 's a new program , hardly related to this . 
  we have n't even seen the effect of the dutch program !, 
   they ship them overseas to my country for detainment . 
  you 're taking credit for the past ? 
  that program just started !, 
  yes , of course , they 're the prisoners we 're talking about . 
  i studied law here in norway and i 've read up on our system . 
  the reports and stats are public . 
   compare how well their system works on violent criminals the 20 % rate applies to norwegian murderers , rapists and violent offenders . 
  at [ one special facility the rate is 16 % ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/04/bastoy-norwegian-prison-works ) , but that 's a place you have to apply to serve the remainder of your sentence at . 
   america has stupid drug laws norway is hard on drugs . 
  there 's no tolerance like the dutch have . 
  the max is 21 years ( no consecutive sentences ) , but you rarely get close to that even in serious [ drug ] cases . 
  dangerous murderers mostly . 
  i 've heard other stats from the us . 
  more like 50-60 % , for both the uk and us . 
  too bad you 're wrong . 
  [ see my other comment . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4vxmta/why_norways_prison_system_is_so_successful/d62k1p2 ), 
  haha , if only !, 
  foreigners and minorities are overrepresented in the crime stats in norway . 
  drugs in particular , violence , robberies and sex crimes are also common . 
  - other europeans such as romanians are often there for theft , etc. 
  - while poles often end up there for smuggling alcohol/tobacco . 
  - lithuanians for drugs and theft . 
  - dutch/moroccans for drug smuggling . 
  - turks , pakistanis and other asians are well represented . 
  - iraqis/kurds for sex crimes , drugs , etc. 
  - nigerians/italians are common due to drugs and prostitution . 
  right , forget the fact that most people convicted of drug crimes are foreigners from europe or much further away . 
  nigeria is high up on the list . 
  crime in norway is now heavily `` globalized '' .

  nah , that depends on where and what . 
  there are very nice dorms in oslo at least .

  yeah , i think so , they 're just planning ahead . 
  take away the parking , bus lane and congestion charge , that does n't matter to me . 
  the sales tax would change things greatly . 
  my most recent car purchase was a new ice vehicle ( 3 yrs ) , because i lived too far outside the city . 
  now that my circumstances have changed , i would buy an ev for economic reasons alone . 
  i could n't care less about the `` green '' aspect or other benefits . 
  clearly not a supporter of the current government . 
  that makes you something else . 
  if you 're not right , you 're wrong :p, 
  did you look at the map ? 
  yes , except for the fact that gdp is not tax money . 
  it 's just a measure of economic activity . 
  the actual revenue is invested abroad in the swf , as mentioned above . 
  the swf contributes a measure to the budget ( limited to 3 % ) . 
  the industry obviously also creates employment , sales and capital taxes ; the salaries of workers in the industries and indirectly related services obviously helps . 
  i should note that * those * workers live mostly on the west coast . 
  the oil industry is concentrated in that region . 
  that 's where the unemployment has risen strongly recently . 
  while i would wager that the majority of teslas are located in the eastern part of norway around the capital . 
   there are no tax revenues from it ? 
  `` we invest it abroad in a swf ''  people work for free in the oil industry `` oil gas represented 25 % of our gdp in 2014 '', 
  yes , that 's the idea behind the continental links i mentioned above  specifically , [ the nordlink cable ] ( http://www.statnett.no/en/projects/nordlink/ ) to germany . 
  `` when there is little production of wind power and solar power in germany the need for power increases and the prices will be higher than in norway . 
  norway can then produce hydropower and export it to germany . 
  this way we get more out of the resources on both sides of the cable . '', 
  this was in the media a few years back : - https://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/sefcovic/blog/norwegian-battery_en - http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/norway-wants-to-offer-hydroelectric-resources-to-europe-a-835037.html we already have nordic market ( [ nordpool ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_pool_spot ) ) . 
  i remember reading a terrible little `` book '' of fiction where the american author had the eu invade the us . 
  first by making quebec a `` protectorate '' , at their invitation , and then subsequently invading the us under some pretense i forget . 
  they reserved [ both ] ( http://www.dagbladet.no/2015/08/24/tema/dinside/motor/bil/aller/40771467/ ) ekxxxxx and evxxxxx for new plates . 
   i 'm not sure if proper numbers on that are available in norway it 's been heavily debated recently due to major infrastructure plans . 
  it 's available in many forms and with different conclusions . 
  in one report the view was that roads and rails investments were a net loss , but how you calculated it determined the outcome . 
  with a narrow 20 year view and without the factors you mentioned it was n't profitable . 
  obviously a more long-term view is sensible and other economic factors matter ( reliability , capacity , increased activity ) . 
  [ cambridge systematics ] ( https://www.camsys.com/publications/economic-analysis ) specializes in this kind of analysis . 
  they recommend that we include those factors ... 
   you 'd have to raise the tax on petrol considerably before breaking even . 
  [ we tax petrol at 70 % in norway . 
  ] ( http://www.smartepenger.no/bilokonomi/98-bil/358-drivstoffavgifter ) in addition car owners pay an annual road tax ( ~ $ 400 ) . 
  we pay for toll roads everywhere . 
  oil & gas represented 25 % of norway 's gdp in 2014 . 
  oil products represents the majority of our exports in value . 
  we invest the revenue abroad in a swf . 
  norway 's national budgets is mostly tax based ; sales , income and capital tax accounts for 75 % . 
   where is the energy they are charging these cars with coming from ? 
  norway is almost entirely hydropowered , as the other comment mentions . 
   does it and the maintenance of the power distribution system have a smaller net carbon footprint ? 
  do you mean the local charging stations ? 
  the grid would have to exist regardless . 
  do you account for gas stations and their transport system ? 
   do these vehicles have a smaller net carbon footprint over their petrol brethren given the resources needed to create their batteries ? 
  i believe they have bigger footprints . 
  i do n't think he 's the best source or entirely neutral . 
  the economic situation in norway is not as good , which will have an effect on car sales and other expensive goods . 
  15,1 % of new cars in 2016 so far have been electric . 
  that 's down from 18,4 % last year .
