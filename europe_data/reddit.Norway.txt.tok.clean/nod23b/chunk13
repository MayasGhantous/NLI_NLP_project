   everyone i know with one are either renting them out or changing them out . 
  ev norway says the majority of owners are happy and would never go back . 
   also sales are down . 
  the economic situation in norway has nothing to do with that at all . 
  - 15,1 % of new cars in 2016 so far have been electric . 
  that 's down from 18,4 % last year . 
  it 's not very dramatic considering . 
  nah , it 's public parking , [ as you can see here , there are n't any chargers over there . 
   the company will pay for her to lease ~ ~ an electric ~ ~ a * fossil powered * car ftfy, 
   plus , stations to recharge a really spare outside of big cities . 
  norway has [ an extensive network ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sdqnsrw.png ) of tesla superchargers . 
  free charging points at shopping malls , public buildings , parking lots and similar are common in norway . 
   they have a range of ~ 250km . 
  i can go that far how often do you really go that far ? 
  i commuted to work here in norway , 150 km each day , an ev would have been fine * without * charging at work . 
  i suppose your profession matters , as an office worker i only drive to work and home again . 
  the national grid of norway has n't been affected by evs as far as i know , but i 've heard that in some towns/streets local demand can accumulate and create challenges . 
  i 've read about problems in connection with housing cooperatives with shared garages/parking . 
  one housing cooperative 's board did n't want to pay for upgrades and chargers to support a few ev owners . 
  it 's a very costly affair . 
  in that case they forbid residents from charging in the garage , because the network was designed for lights , etc. 
  our biggest challenge with regards to the power grid is regional . 
  we have [ an ambitious plan to upgrade and expand ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qjn3ehw.png ) . 
  - primarily the plan to supply [ the oil platforms with power from the mainland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bl6w8od.gif ) to reduce their co2 emissions . 
  norway is naturally [ focused on our maritime resources . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ydy4yht.png ) - [ the central region ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a6eamlo.png ) of norway is especially problematic , it lacks sufficient peak capacity and needs access to other regions . 
  - [ we 're building links to the continent and uk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dezlgau.png ) to expand beyond the nordic market ( for export and import ) . 
  we already [ supply them with natural gas ] ( http://www.norskpetroleum.no/wp-content/uploads/08a-gassr%c2%a2rledninger-e.png ) ( pipes ) . 
  - this should enable [ the nordic market ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zivlxhk.png ) to work better , hopefully changing [ the future patterns in the region . 
  yes , however , it 's recently come to light that its the rocky mountains air stream and the gulf stream that creates our climate . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 'll be there sooner rather than later . 
  i mean your car industry is gearing up now . 
  mercedes and vw plans for electric models is impressive . 
  my brother opted for the mercedes electric over the tesla and i can see why . 
  i 'm not so sure ? 
  [ the k\u00f6ppen classification map seems to support it . 
  ] ( http://fluxnet.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/koeppen-geiger_fluxnet_fullsize-9-13.png ) based on what i 've heared from family and visitors from washington ( state ) , our west coast is quite similar to that region . 
  a person i knew from quebec description indicated similar weather patterns to [ \\ [ colder \\ ] inland norway ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8iqxl7j.png ) , but it 's all anecdotal . 
   i was making a joke , i never expected it to spark a huge debate . 
  sorry , i just thought it was interesting . 
   there is a reason rural communities are more conservative than urban ones . 
  yes , in some ways , but education matters a lot more . 
  the internet and media helps as well . 
  in norway people leave for university in the cities and often return later in life to start families , etc. 
  village life is n't that conservative any longer , in my opinion , and i live in one now . 
  maybe turkey is a bit different in this respect . 
   there are huge economies of scale available to large cities ... more efficient in other respects ... 
  yes , of course , that does n't mean we need huge populations though . 
  it just means we can support more people that way . 
  if all of norway moved to oslo , the cost per capita would be lower , but it does n't logically mean we would need more norwegians or cities . 
   overpopulation is n't a real issue ... earth can support about 40 billion people that 's not exactly true according to most sources i read . 
  if you expect to give them water , food and energy [ consumption ] at modern levels . 
  the tech we have is n't quite ready to provide that . 
   having more people means more genetic diversity which means we wont be easily wiped out by one disease or another . 
  that 's a very interesting argument . 
  however , that only really works for distinct populations . 
  please , excuse the simple example , but i hope you see my point . 
  if turkey is struck by a virus you do n't have that much diversity in your population , while norwegians might be immune based on some stroke of genetic luck . 
  if most people in your population die , only the survivors would be better suited for the future . 
  that 's not really an argument for big populations as such . 
  i might be forgetting something here though , 
  yeah , that 's not unusual for inland parts of norway . 
  in my region , a southern coastal region , it 's usually below -10 c ( between -10 and -20 ) . 
  we 're further north than where most canadians live , 
  ah , good point . 
  ironically , * the dane * forgot about wind power !, 
  it 's a fair question , but norway has been ~ 99 % hydroelectric since the previous century . 
  we built the hydropower for industry and heating our homes , and it keeps on giving . 
  if you commute to oslo in the morning you 'll see hundreds of teslas , nissan leafs , electric bmw , mercedes , kia 's , etc. 
  it 's 25 % of new cars , and about 15 % of the market . 
  it 's both actually , there 's parking all over that area . 
  that 's why tesla has installed superchargers all over norway . 
  yes , it 's a public parking area . 
  [ you can see it here . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zhtqv7t.png ) it 's close to [ an ancient fortress/castle ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zgg3ovh.png ) , so they wo n't expand or tear down anything . 
  it 's exceptional in that sense . 
  it 's 16 amp , 230v , type 2 . 
  [ here 's an interview video from the garage . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/_cjpfem0sb4?t=403 ), 
  we do n't spend our oil & gas money , we invest it abroad in a swf . 
  we limit ourselves to the interest ( max 3 % p.a. ) . 
  norway 's budget is financed by sales , income and capital taxes ( for 75 % of the total ) . 
  oil gas represented 25 % of our gdp in 2014 , not the budget , but the majority of our exports . 
   our blue/blue ( superblue ? ), 
  government is going to fuck that up for us says the lefty * without * any real arguments or evidence . 
  the city pays for it , but it helps that it owns the local and huge [ hydro ] power company as well . 
  [ tesla seems to work pretty well in norwegian winters . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fslmlozxjhk ) the guy in the video gets ~ 20 % range reduction . 
  that 's denmark . 
   i mea n't individually . 
  greater tokyo and new york are bigger than 20 mil though . 
  yeah , that 's a fair point . 
  i guess we have different perspectives on that . 
  i see turkey and other countries as vastly overpopulated . 
  it makes me think of poverty and resource challenges . 
  it 's a negative in my book , as you can tell . 
  in my view we do n't need more people in scandinavia . 
  we need to keep it just right . 
  we 're caretakers of this land ; fauna and flora should be given priority over limitless human expansion . 
  the technological upheaval that 's coming with ai/robotics will mean even less need for human workers .
