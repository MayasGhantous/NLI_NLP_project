  as you said , it was formerly used , because it 's extinct . 
   some , frankly , butthurt commercials . 
  i hardly think they 're `` butthurt '' or groveling . 
   the accent is hilarious accent ? 
  unless you know norwegian you ca n't tell that they have an accent . 
  well , [ we hope to export a million liters to sweden this year ] ( http://www.dn.no/smak/2016/05/06/2147/smak/faller-for-norsk-vin ) , hehe . 
  we do make some sparkling wine already . 
  we 're researching grapes that can grow in our climate ( from minnesota in the usa , france and canada ) . 
   the uk used to speak french . 
  well , the nobility did . 
  french * was * the global language , 
  fix the eu ? 
  do you mean cut its balls off ? 
  eh , the uk has been pro-turkey because it would presumably hinder further integration of the eu ... 
  the us also is pro-turkey-joining and has stated so publicly . 
  no wonder , they 're trying to keep turkey in the west and nato . 
  they really do n't want to lose that strategic airport ... 
   '' - by '' , which i believe it danish for town . 
  yes , indeed , in all of the scandinavian languages . 
   english is almost like a hybrid germanic and romance language . 
  yes , let 's blame the french ( or normans ) . 
   most germanic and romance languages are easiest to learn for native english speakers because they have a lot of similarities the vocabulary matters a lot in my opinion . 
  english has entirely too many french/latin loanwords , but it can be an aid when you 're trying to understand romance languages . 
   i believe german is n't in the same class as those mentioned mainly because of it 's structure . 
  it 's only a * little * bit more structured though . 
   it probably depends on where you are from , too , because your accent can often determine how difficult a language is . 
  yes , i suppose there 's some help in speaking a * dialect * of english . 
  it 's proven useful in understanding other dialects/languages . 
  it 's frequently cited as the reason norwegians understand swedish/danish better than the reverse . 
  we have a multitude of dialects that differ widely , but we usually understand each other nonetheless . 
   in the north east of england i swear some of the slang terms are scandinavian , such as `` gan yam '' for `` going home '' ( danish is `` g\u00e5 hjem '' ? 
  ) , `` no '' is `` nee '' ( nej ) yeah , those seem very similar , the same applies in parts of scotland . 
  words like house , mouse , hands , cow etc. 
   you 've met plenty of both and made a phonetic analysis on this small sample ? 
  good for you . 
  yes , just like you did ... 
  remember , you also made a claim ? 
  or does * your * sample include all finns and icelanders ? 
  getting back to the issue at hand ; as a third-party , when i hear iceland or finnish , i hear * two * foreign languages . 
  they 're very different accents . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  they have lots of complicated sounds you 'd struggle with . 
  their vocabulary is based on everything from spanish to german . 
  edit : the us foreign service institute ( fsi ) has created a list to show the approximate time you need to learn a specific language as an english speaker . 
  please keep in mind that this ranking only shows the view of the foreign service institute ( fsi ) and some language students or experts may disagree with the ranking . 
  category i : 23-24 weeks ( 575-600 hours ) languages closely related to english : - afrikaans - danish - dutch - norwegian - swedish for some reason these are included in the same category !, 
  : - french - spanish - italian - portuguese - romanian, 
  he 's wrong . 
  you both have very distinct accents in general . 
  how can it be otherwise ? 
  icelandic has very distinct sounds and melody . 
  haha , no way . 
  i 've met plenty of both . 
  hehe , thanks for telling us , that 's amusing !, 
  yeah , that was part of the `` serious trouble '' i mentioned  it likely has a serious impact on people 's attitudes towards the eu . 
  especially , the redistribution program they 're trying to implement , which would force us to accept more . 
  well , you already spoke english , it 's a foreign language for us , 
   also from how i know the eu bureaucracy , if they want something , they will get it , whenever the citizens want it or not . 
  i assume you 're talking about the eurozone ? 
  that 's why they secured the exceptions in the * treaties * ( binding legal agreements ) . 
  the eu 's bureaucracy has no power to supersede the treaties . 
  even the eu court ( cjeu ) could n't break it , because it 's an agreement between states ( countries ) . 
   if what you 're selling is good enough , people will want to buy . 
  no , that 's not how this works . 
  the eu is n't perfect by any means , but the ideas it 's built on are not bad . 
  you can be against the eu in principle because of national sovereignty , but that does n't mean the union is bad in itself . 
  there are plenty of us citizens that want their state to secede . 
  the us is the model for the eu . 
  would you argue the us is a bad union ? 
  for some or all ? 
  ordinary people are like children in that they do n't want bad tasting medicine . 
  try selling cuts to social spending in europe !, 
  it 's political suicide for politicians to be fiscally responsible . 
   during the last 5 years the `` out '' side has been really solid that 's 5 years of serious trouble for the eu . 
  it 's only natural that the against side gets stronger . 
  now , i guess we 'll see if the oil crash/future developments will make us look at things differently . 
   compared to usd of course . 
  `` of course '' , says the romanian eu citizen ... 
  here 's [ a chart showing gbp vs usd \\ ( 10 years \\ ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fzhhi8b.png ) , it appears to be pretty stable ? 
   do i need to mention they will also be forced to join the euro-zone if they stay in the eu ? 
  you mean ** except ** for [ the exception the uk and denmark have ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#economic_and_monetary_union_.e2.80.93_denmark_and_the_united_kingdom ), 
  a uk deal would have to be quite similar to the norwegian one though ? 
  in that the uk would surely have to pay for market access , and they would n't get a say in the eu 's regulations . 
   does n't seem to me that the average norwegian is particularly down about not being in the eu . 
  we 're not unhappy because we got what we wanted sort of . 
  we pay for that and know the deal . 
  the brits will certainly have a different relationship with the eu post-brexit . 
  i ca n't imagine they 'll be overjoyed at the prospect of paying for it * and * getting less influence . 
  paying less probably , but at what cost ? 
  yeah , 70 % in a recent poll . 
  it does tend to vary quite a bit . 
  the current status of the europe/world has had * some * effect on those numbers . 
  it has never been higher though !, 
  probably , but they do n't really speak that . 
  it 's more about their `` english '' . 
  now you have me watching talks about doric ; [ `` we ' r needin tae talk aboot wir language '' ( tedxinverness ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrnq8lycvfu ) , 
  norwegian , ye ken , like my flag , 
  haha , that as well !, 
  he spoke english with a clear scottish accent the first years afterwards ,
